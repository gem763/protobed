'TELL THE TRUTH' XR say the Government must 'tell the truth by declaring a climate and ecological emergency' and work with other institutions to 'communicate the urgency for change' 2. 'ACT NOW' Protesters say Government must 'act now to halt biodiversity loss' and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025. 3. 'BEYOND POLITICS' XR say Government must 'create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens' Assembly on climate and ecological justice.'\n\nMr Atkinson was led into a van by two police officers while still wearing his Boris Johnson-style wig.\n\nAs he was driven away, he waved to cheering supporters before blowing a kiss shortly before the van left the property.\n\nMetropolitan Police Westminster said in a statement: 'Police were called at 15:33hrs on Friday, 18 October to reports of a man climbing up scaffolding surrounding Big Ben. Officers from the Met's rope team were on scene.\n\n'At approx. 18:45hrs the man, aged in his 40s, was arrested under Section 128 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 \u2013 trespass on a protected site.\n\n'He has been taken into custody.'\n\nAccording to the act, the charge carries a maximum sentence of 51 weeks' imprisonment or an unlimited fine.\n\nIt comes as the Metropolitan Police said conditions imposed on Extinction Rebellion protesters, which barred an assembly of more than two people linked to its Autumn Uprising action in the capital, have been lifted.\n\nThe group has a pending legal challenge against the order, which many of its activists defied, and the case is expected to be heard on Thursday next week.\n\nThe force tweeted: 'Following review, there is no longer a necessity for the conditions upon the Extinction Rebellion Autumn Uprising assembly; they are no longer in place.'\n\nShortly before climbing the building, Mr Atkinson posted a photo of himself with a blonde wig, swimming goggles, blazer and tie, adding: 'Ready steady breathe deep... go.'\n\nThe eco-protest group said the act was intended to highlight Government inaction on the 'climate and ecological emergency'.\n\nTree surgeon Ben Atkinson, 43, evaded the police officers who patrol the Parliamentary estate and began a daring freeclimb of the structure shortly before 4pm\n\nOnce at the edge of the scaffolding he unfurled a rainbow-coloured XR banner, with the words 'No pride on a dead planet' while another said 'Citizens Assembly'\n\nThe eco-protest group said the act was intended to highlight Government inaction on the 'climate and ecological emergency'\n\nTree surgeon Ben Atkinson, 43, evaded the police officers who patrol the Parliamentary estate and began a daring freeclimb of the structure shortly before 4pm (pictured: A status posted on Facebook)\n\nPolice had closed the entrance to Westminster Tube station that is across the road from Big Ben, and asked people to leave the area directly in front of where the demonstrator was climbing. Other entrances to the Tube station remain open.\n\nOne onlooker said officers had used a lift that is part of the scaffolding to reach Mr Atkinson and could be seen speaking to him as he sat in the netting. Other officers were seen at the base of the tower with ropes.\n\nYoga teacher Katherine Beaumont, an XR member who said she speaks for Mr Atkinson, said he was demanding to speak to Boris Johnson 'wig to wig'.\n\nIn a statement on his behalf, she said: 'What is Boris scared of? He must be terrified because he is hiding from a bunch of ''crusties'', pensioners, normal people with children and loves, lives and jobs, peaceful protesters and non-violent communicators.\n\nThe climb was the latest in a string of stunts staged by Extinction Rebellion on the penultimate day of their autumn uprising - despite being barred from protesting in the capital since Monday by the Met Police (pictured: Mr Atkinson posted this image online after scaling the structure)\n\nExtinction Rebellion protester Ben Atkinson from Rydal, in Cumbria, holds onto the scaffolding surrounding Elizabeth Tower which houses Big Ben\n\nYoga teacher Katherine Beaumont, an XR member who said she speaks for Mr Atkinson, said he was demanding to speak to Boris Johnson 'wig to wig'\n\nIn a statement on his behalf, she said: 'What is Boris scared of? He must be terrified because he is hiding from a bunch of ''crusties'', pensioners, normal people with children and loves, lives and jobs, peaceful protesters and non-violent communicators.'\n\n'If he represents the people then where is he? Hiding and not representing the country. Hiding from eminent global disaster and failing us all from a position of power.\n\n'I would like to talk to him. I'm not afraid of all these police, of dizzy heights and of facing the reality of what is happening to our living planet.\n\n'Come up here Boris. I would love a friendly and peaceful chat with you. Wig to wig.'\n\nShe said Mr Atkinson is from Rydal, in Cumbria.\n\nAnother Extinction Rebellion protester said he had 'no idea' that Mr Atkinson was going to climb the tower.\n\n'We all come from different circles but are all part of Extinction Rebellion,' said Harry, who did not want to give his last name.\n\n'We don't want to bring down the system, we want to shake them enough to get some action.'\n\nSporting a jacket and tie over a vivid green t-shirt and a pair of leggings, Mr Atkinson climbed approximately sixty to eighty feet up the structure and walked out along a scaffold gantry at the height of the roof of the Palace of Westminster\n\nTree surgeon Ben Atkinson, 43, pictured unfurling a banner having climbed a considerable way up the clock tower\n\nThe protester was wearing a blond wig, jacket and tie so as to resemble the Prime Minister but paired his costume with a green pair of leggings and a t-shirt\n\nMr Atkinson made it to within around 20ft of the famous clock face when he unfurled his banner, having climbed up the scaffolding put up around the tower during full-scale renovations\n\nThe climb was the latest in a string of stunts staged by Extinction Rebellion on the penultimate day of their autumn uprising - despite being barred from protesting in the capital since Monday by the Met Police.\n\nEarlier the group performed a 'red handed' march, where they sprayed hand prints using chalk-based spray paint around Whitehall.\n\nBut only a handful of the group's diehards showed up to occupy one of the capital's busiest road junctions.\n\nThe eco-activists have set up a wooden pyramid structure at the junction of Oxford Street and Regent's Street, as police, whose resources have been stretched by two weeks of stunts, moved in.\n\nThe small group of activists who had assembled sent out tweets pleading for reinforcements as their numbers dwindled, coming 24 hours after violent scenes during a protest on the Tube dented their appeal.\n\nThe demo was just a shadow of the April chaos, when actress Emma Thompson joined hundreds of activists on a pink boat parked in Oxford Circus, which they occupied for days.\n\nThis latest stunt saw buses, many of which are made to reduce emissions, cancelled or rerouted, causing delays for workers.\n\nExtinction Rebellion this afternoon marched through Westminster and staged a sit in out the front of Downing Street. They were also carrying out a 'red handed' protest which will see it spray-paint handprints on landmarks.\n\nExtinction Rebellion took over Oxford Street today as their fortnight of stunts ground on, testing Londoners' patience\n\nThe group, whose cause suffered a setback when an activists resorted to violence yesterday, admitted they were low on numbers\n\nYesterday commuters sick of delays and mayhem took steps to arrest demonstrators themselves at Canning Town tube station. The group later apologised over the violence, and scaled down a planned 'shutdown' of Gatwick Airport, but still continued their disruption this morning.\n\nResponses from many of Twitter showed that public sympathy with the group has run dry. Many Londoners branded today's action 'pointless' and counter-productive.\n\nAbby Deveney wrote: 'Blocking Oxford Circus halts buses used by real people ... people with buggies, people with walking sticks, people with invisible mobility issues, yeah, those kind of people. This strategy is not helpful'\n\nAnother Twitter user wrote: 'The extinction rebellion lot made me late to work. They really blocked Oxford Street (where regular cars are already banned) and just disrupted public transport. They need to work on their tactics.'\n\nRobert Hook wrote: 'A fairly pointless protest indeed, given that the desire of most vendors along Oxford Street is to pedestrianise it!\n\n'It's true that this is one of the most polluted streets on the planet, but the only people inconvenienced by this are the people least able to make a difference!'\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion spokesman said of the Oxford Circus protest: 'The end of the Rebellion approaches, and Oxford Circus has once again been occupied by Extinction Rebellion, to be used as a space of community and democratic resistance.\n\n'We are coming together to tell the truth, and to bring attention to why we are protesting. It's not about causing meaningless disruption; we have a vital message to bring - the consequences of the climate and ecological crisis are horrific.\n\n'Extinction Rebellion, as well as other movements around the world including the climate strikes and decades of indigenous resistance, are using the beacon of civil resistance to shine a light on this emergency.'\n\nScores of police stand circled the wooden pyramid structure, as protesters sat on top of it, or lay down underneath it\n\nPolice escort protesters dressed in red along Whitehall in London during an Extinction Rebellion demo this afternoon\n\nComedian Steve Coogan (right) today become the latest celebrity to support the Extinction Rebellion protest, joining activists (some dressed in red for their 'red hand protest, left) on a march towards Whitehall\n\nComedian Steve Coogan today become the latest celebrity to support the Extinction Rebellion protest, joining activists on a march towards Whitehall.\n\nCoogan told the PA news agency: 'I wanted to lend my voice to the cause. Maybe people who like what I have done and who might not be completely sold on Extinction Rebellion might give it a second chance.\n\n'It's an important movement. Some people try to characterise it as a fringe movement, but it's not. I like the fact that it was started by young people, but now older people have joined in too.\n\n'Climate change feels like just another issue on the agenda that people are reluctant to pay attention to. But people in Extinction Rebellion and people who seriously believe want to make it a bigger issue.\n\n'Anyone who is against the movement is motivated purely by the bottom line.\n\n'I have always been environmentally aware and environmentally conscious. I just do not want to stand on the sidelines and not participate. It's easy to sit and not do anything.'\n\nAs protests enter day 12, Extinction Rebellion is planning a 'red handed' protest which will see it spray-paint handprints around Westminster.\n\nAsked about why the activists were protesting despite the police ban, Phyllis Wolff from Dorset said it would be a bigger risk if they did not act.\n\n'It's a bigger risk for us not to do this,' she told the PA news agency.\n\n'I look at my grandchildren and I think, how can I not do this?'\n\nActivist Alice Hampton, from London, said the group has the right to protest.\n\n'We do have a right to a powerful protest in this country,' she told the PA news agency.\n\n'Climate change is probably the biggest issue we have ever faced. We are here protesting peacefully.'\n\nExtinction Rebellion which launched its latest campaign 10 days ago, said it was planning on using washable chalk spray to mark the path of its march from Whitehall Gardens to six government departments.\n\nA spokesman said: 'We will raise our red hands, taking responsibility for our actions - we all have blood on our hands.\n\n'We march in admission and recognition of the part we play in the injustice of this emergency, and the ongoing suffering of thousands of people around the world due to the climate and ecological breakdown.'\n\nThe Autumn Uprising is due to end at 6pm on Saturday.\n\nElsewhere in London fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood, joined her son Joe Corre and a member of Extinction Rebellion outside the head office of BP.\n\nThey are delivering a report on the company's activities in West Papua in Indonesia.", "description": "An Extinction Rebellion activist climbed the clock tower which houses Big Ben on the banks of the Thames.
