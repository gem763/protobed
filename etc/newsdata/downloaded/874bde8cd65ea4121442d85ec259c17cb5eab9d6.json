A rotating cast of some 300 scientists is slated to live and work aboard the Polarstern this year; by documenting an entire year of change in the north, they hope to improve models of how Arctic melting will affect weather in the rest of the world.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOrganizers spent months combing through satellite imagery and historic records, weeks conducting helicopter survey flights and days crisscrossing ice on snow machines and sleds before making their selection of a floe this week.\n\nThe process was made more difficult after a summer of record warmth; by September, there were very few ice floes thick enough to support the expedition.\n\n[Adrift in the Arctic: Nowhere on Earth is warming as fast. Scientists will spend a year trapped in sea ice to understand what that means for the world.]\n\nOn Sept. 28, scientists aboard the Polarstern set foot on an oval-shaped floe about 1.5 miles in diameter. Viewed from space, the floe looked mostly dark \u2014 a signature of thin ice riddled with melt ponds.\n\nAD\n\nBut when researchers surveyed a bright white region in the floe\u2019s northern edge, they found several feet of firm, highly compressed ice \u2014 an ideal surface on which to set up camp. They named this stable area \u201cthe fortress.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found our home for the months to come,\u201d MOSAiC\u2019s expedition leader, Markus Rex, a polar scientist at Germany\u2019s Alfred Wegener Institute, said in a statement. \u201cIt may not be the perfect floe, but it\u2019s the best one in this part of the Arctic and offers better working conditions than we could have expected after a warm Arctic summer.\u201d\n\nArctic ice extents at the end of this melt season were the third-lowest on record. About 800,000 square miles more open water was exposed in the middle of September than is typical for that time of year. This meant the Polarstern and its support ship, the Fedorov, had to sail farther and search harder for a suitable ice floe.\n\nAD\n\nIn his blog, MOSAiC researcher Marc Oggier described the ships slicing through fragile, soupy \u201cgrease ice\u201d until at last, on the horizon, the voyagers spotted the thin white line of the ice edge.\n\nAD\n\nNow the researchers must work to swiftly set up camp. The six-month Arctic night is fast approaching; as of Friday, the sun will no longer rise above the horizon. Soon, all daylight will disappear.\n\nThe camp will resemble a small city, lit by floodlights and linked by pathways made of wooden planks to ensure that no wayward explorers accidentally walk across a colleague\u2019s experiment. Oceanographers, geophysicists, meteorologists, biologists and a host of other researchers will collect information on every imaginable aspect of the sea, ice, sky and their inhabitants. The data will be fed into a gigantic database shared first with the hundreds of MOSAiC collaborators, then with scientists all over the world.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe data will be the legacy of this expedition,\u201d said Don Perovich, a Dartmouth geophysicist and one of the co-leaders for MOSAiC\u2019s sea ice experiments.\n\nRead more:\n\nMost American teens are frightened by climate change, poll finds, and about 1 in 4 are taking action\n\nPlane takes off in rare, risky effort to rescue sick workers from the South Pole\n\nThis ancient climate catastrophe is our best clue about Earth\u2019s future\n\nExtreme climate change has arrived in America\n\nAD", "description": "After a rigorous search in a rapidly melting Arctic, researchers have finally found a suitable floe with which their vessel can drift across the North Pole.", "authors": ["Sarah Kaplan", "Reporter For Speaking Of Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_spUJcGLV348V7GTDZugtLO48es=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/72WTK2DUBMI6TEZRGC6FQNXURY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
