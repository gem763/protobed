Mamadou Bailo Bah had come home from work as a food delivery driver that evening when he was attacked in the parking lot outside his apartment, according to friends and Prince George\u2019s County police.\n\nAD\n\nMore than a week later, investigators are urging the public to come forward with information that could help close the case. At this point, investigators can\u2019t figure out who would want to hurt Bah or why, police said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt looks like a completely random incident,\u201d said Tony King, acting captain of the homicide and robbery unit for Prince George\u2019s County police. \u201cRight now we\u2019re exploring every motive in this incident.\u201d\n\nOfficers who were called to a shooting at around 7:25 p.m. Oct. 11 found Bah with gunshot wounds in a parking lot in the 1800 block of Metzerott Road, police said, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nWhen Abdoulaye Bah heard his friend had been shot, he rushed to the scene.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was surprised,\u201d said Abdoulaye Bah, a childhood friend who has the same last name. \u201cHe does not have a lot of friends here. He does not have enemies. I was in shock. Why? Why him?\u201d\n\nAbdoulaye Bah, who lives in Baltimore, said his friend had lived at the Metzerott Road apartment for only a few weeks on a temporary basis as he awaited approval for a new place.\n\nAD\n\nBah\u2019s dream was to come to the United States and learn English, Abdoulaye Bah said. The friends had plans to work together in the future, with Mamadou Bailo Bah looking to study business and earn an associate degree from Montgomery College, Abdoulaye Bah said.\n\nMamadou Bailo Bah and Abdoulaye Bah are not related, but the two met decades ago when they were in preschool. They spent so much time with each other that their parents eventually became friends, Abdoulaye Bah said.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Abdoulaye Bah moved to the United States in 2010, the friends stayed in touch despite the distance. Then in 2018, the two reunited in Maryland after Abdoulaye Bah helped his friend apply for the student visa that brought him to the United States.\n\n\u201cHe came here with me to learn English and then go back to his country and work,\u201d Abdoulaye Bah said. \u201cHis father\u2019s business is based in Morocco. He wanted to be the one who was going to take that one day. He wanted to follow his father\u2019s footsteps.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMamadou Bailo Bah\u2019s killing has rattled the area\u2019s Guinean community, which has banded together to raise funds for his family.\n\nDoumbouya Dialla, president of the Association of Guineans in the DMV, is working with a similar association in Baltimore to collect at least $10,000 for Bah\u2019s family and urge the public to come forward with information that could help solve the case.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe need help to know exactly what happened,\u201d Dialla said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why him.\u201d\n\nMamadou Aliou Diallo, a friend of Bah\u2019s, is also working to return Bah\u2019s body to Guinea.\n\n\u201cHe was a very ambitious young man with lots of hopes and dreams,\u201d Diallo said. \u201cAt this point we cannot bring his life back. The only thing we can try to do is bring his body back to his family so that their hearts and minds are at peace.\u201d\n\nBah\u2019s father said he hopes anyone with information about his son\u2019s killing will contact police so authorities can \u201ccatch the person and to take them to justice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKing said the apartment complex where Bah was killed is a large, busy area and investigators hope anyone who saw anything, \u201ceven if they think it\u2019s insignificant,\u201d will contact police.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo detail is too small,\u201d King said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for answers for his family and friends here and overseas.\u201d\n\nOn social media accounts from across the world, Mamadou Bailo Bah\u2019s friends and families have posted tributes to him or turned their profile pictures black in mourning. They remembered him as an ambitious, hard-working man who wanted to make his family proud.\n\nIlias Bah said his older brother was loved by everyone, eager to \u201cfight to become a great man\u201d to improve his family\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cMy older brother was a very wise, intelligent young man who had the joy of living his life,\u201d Ilias Bah said. \u201cHe loved his family very much despite the long distance. . . . He was always there for us, and we will build ourselves to make him proud.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The killing of Mamadou Bailo Bah appears to be a \u201ccompletely random incident,\u201d and police are asking for the public\u2019s help to solve the case.", "authors": ["Lynh Bui", "Reporter Focusing On Public Safety", "Criminal Justice"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/-wnVhe9clweVW88UgqERK4QCuhw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IWWH7ZXTOMI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
