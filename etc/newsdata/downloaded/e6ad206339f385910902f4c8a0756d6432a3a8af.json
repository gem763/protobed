The manager had been asked whether Rashford might have developed differently had he gone out on loan earlier in his career.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s difficult to say because their skill-set is different and when you look at so many different centre-forwards and the strengths that they have, they all are slightly different. I can remember Kevin trying to get Michael \u2013 it\u2019s probably in his book! \u2013 to come to the ball and hold it up.\n\n\u201cIt was throwing Michael a little bit because his game was to get in behind teams and that\u2019s where his goals have come from, and I think it\u2019s hard because I think that a player\u2019s attributes are formed relatively early. You can work on things and improve things for sure.\n\n\u201cBut, by 18, 19 or 20 their super strengths are already there. The other bits, you can hone a bit or polish a bit. But, I think their outstanding attributes have already developed. A lot of it is through their physical capabilities.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s why it\u2019s so exciting for players like Mason [Mount] or [Phil] Foden because they are physically smaller. They have had to find a way to survive against the bigger kids. But then when their growth comes as well, they\u2019ve got the strength added to the skill.\n\n\u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be so sure that Marcus [Rashford] would have developed differently, just by the loan. Every experience you take something from but I think his major strengths are, as we see them and for internationals, we have to find the best positions for them to get those strengths out.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate feels Marcus Rashford\u2019s best work is as a \u201cwide raider\u201d rather than an outright\u00a0No 9, despite the Manchester United forward seeming energised by comparisons to Harry Kane.
