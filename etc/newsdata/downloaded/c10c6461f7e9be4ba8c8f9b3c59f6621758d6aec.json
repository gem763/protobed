Scores on their IQs, their ability to understand language, motor skills and emotional control could predict their walking speed at 45, according to the paper published in Jama Network Open journal.\n\nThere was a difference of 12 IQ points on average between children who grew up to be slowest (with a mean gait speed of 1.21 metres per second) and fastest (with a mean gait speed of 1.75 metres per second).\n\nScientists believe this is because the ability to walk depends on the interplay of many organ systems. They also believe cognitive functions like memory and walking speed could be associated.\n\n\u201cA person\u2019s walking speed depends on the function of all these systems working smoothly together, and reduced walking speed can be a sign of advanced ageing and deteriorating function of these organ systems,\u201d said senior author Terrie E Moffitt from Duke University and King\u2019s College London. \u201cThis inexpensive and quick test tells us a lot about their inner health, and how fast their organ systems and brains are ageing towards later diseases.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But this study covered the period from the preschool years to midlife, and found that a slow walk is a problem sign decades before old age.\u201d\n\nThe research is based on a long-term study of 904 people born during the same year in Dunedin in New Zealand. Participants have been studied their whole lives, with the most recent research between April 2017 and April 2019 when participants were 45.\n\nResearchers used MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to look at what was happening in the brain.\n\nProfessor Stephanie Studenski from the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study, said that testing gait speed could be an inexpensive indicator of wellbeing across adulthood.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe study confirms that a subset of persons in their 40s already show indicators of future health challenges and are already ageing more quickly than their peers. Furthermore, this study suggests that unknown factors that had already affected 3-year-old children also influenced their health and function 40 years later.\u201d\n\nSome of the differences in health and cognition may be linked to an individual\u2019s life choices, scientists say.\n\nProfessor Studenski commented that some of the markers of childhood brain health could have been influenced by other important factors such as anxiety, sensory functions or how well the child felt on the day of testing.\n\n\u201cAlthough the associations persisted after accounting for childhood socioeconomic status, there are many things we do not know about these children, including their prenatal care, birth weight, childhood illnesses, sensory function, home situations, or environmental risks,\u201d she said.", "description": "Walking slowly could be a sign you\u2019re more likely to get sick in later life, according to new\u00a0research. \u00a0 A simple test to measure the speed someone walks could predict their chance of getting diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s decades before symptoms develop, scientists say.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/11/12/istock-980754058.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
