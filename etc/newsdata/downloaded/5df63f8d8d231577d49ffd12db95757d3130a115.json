But the first hug he got Saturday in Atlanta came from pitching coach Paul Menhart, and for good reason.\n\n\u201cHe has helped me a lot on the field, but off the field, too,\u201d Barrett said.\n\nBarrett was drafted by the Nationals in 2010 and, three years later, he worked his way to Double-A Harrisburg, where he met Menhart, their pitching coach at the time.\n\nAfter pitching for the Nationals in 2014 and 2015, Tommy John surgery and other arm problems forced the right-hander from Indiana out of the majors. His comeback was capped Saturday with a scoreless inning of relief against the Braves.\n\n\u201cAaron is like a son to me,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cThat outing was emotional for so many people that helped him get back, myself included.\u201d\n\nAfter years of toiling in the minors, Menhart, 50, was named a major league pitching coach for the first time in May when the Nationals asked him to replace Derek Lilliquist. Early in his time with the Nationals organization, Menhart said he received some good advice from Nationals director of player development Doug Harris.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ever change who you are,\u201d Menhart recalled. \u201cI am who I am. I never claim to know everything. I listen to the veterans as much as I listen to the younger guys.\u201d\n\nThat approach is now helping Menhart deal with everyone from Washington\u2019s young pitchers like Wander Suero to veterans like Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg.\n\n\u201cI have a unique way of doing things, which is very difficult to explain,\u201d Menhart said. \u201cI am a big believer in getting guys out as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nWhen Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo promoted Menhart, he entrusted Harris to call Menhart with the good news. Menhart took the call from his home in Georgia, where he was based as the roving minor league pitching coordinator.\n\n\u201cPaul has worked so hard and so long for that opportunity,\u201d Harris said. \u201cTo be able to make that phone call was very special.\u201d\n\nHarris first met Menhart after the latter had worked with Strasburg in the Arizona Fall League in 2009.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that stood out was his ability to connect with individuals and get the most out of them,\u201d Harris said. Harris was a minor league pitcher with the Orioles.\n\nMenhart and Harris were both drafted in 1990 and played against each other in the minors. They have become more than colleagues, but are close friends. Harris said Menhart has been there for him the past four years as Harris dealt with health challenges, including leukemia.\n\nWashington manager Dave Martinez appreciates Menhart\u2019s communication skills.\n\n\u201cHe listens as well,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cHe is willing to listen. He takes everything in before he starts to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe lets us do our thing but also gives us his input, which is really good,\u201d Nationals starter Patrick Corbin said.\n\nMASN TV analyst and former seven-year major leaguer F.P. Santangelo has noted several times on air the \u201cmagic trips\u201d Menhart makes to the pitcher\u2019s mound. Santangelo said there have been several cases where something turns out well for Washington pitchers after a Menhart visit.\n\n\u201cI know for a fact it works,\u201d Nationals reliever Javy Guerra said. \u201cHe gives me something I can use right away.\u201d\n\nMenhart, however, hasn\u2019t been able to completely solve the bullpen woes.\n\nWashington had the worst bullpen ERA in the majors before Menhart arrived in May. The situation has gotten better, thanks in part to trades in late July, but the ERA was 5.74 with 79 homers allowed going into the series opener Tuesday at Minnesota.\n\n\u201cAll we can control is the process and preparation,\u201d Harris said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
