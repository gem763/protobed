Should the description of the woman's 'dream man' fit that of your ex, then sharing is caring.\n\n\"We're trying to make sure this is not like any other dating site,\" the stokvel's administrator, Mamikie Mahlangu told Daily Sun. Two members (at the time of the post) had already met potential boyfriends.\n\n\"[The group] will be safe. If anything happens to any of our members, we will involve [the] cops,\" she said.\n\nHow it works\n\nAccording to Mahlangu, all a woman needs to do is tell them the kind of man wanted and the stokvel will do the rest\n\n\"If he fits the description, we make sure you meet. What happens after that is up to you.\"\n\nOne of the members of the stokvel, speaking to Daily Sun said she and her new man were due to meet for a second date. While another officially had a boyfriend, thanks to the group.\n\nThis should not be a problem if you are only sending your personal information onto the group says, Verlie Oosthuizen, head of social media law at Shepstone and Wylie Attorneys.\n\nWith South Africa's very strict privacy laws, one cannot simply give out people's information without their consent on any platform. This could mean, should users feel their ex is perfect for someone else, they should be given an opportunity to consent to their number being shared in the group.\n\nThough the Whatsapp group could appear to be harmless and fun, one should always be cognisant of the consequences of all social media platforms, Oosthuizen warns.\n\n\"[People] feel like they can share what whatever they like on social media,\" she says.\n\n\"Unlike in the US where the freedom of speech laws are more relaxed, in South Africa, freedom of speech has its own consequences.\" She warns that people can expect heavier restrictions one the Protection of Personal Information (PoPI) Act comes into effect.\n\nBusiness Insider South Africa previously reported that a new Whatsapp stokvel had launched urging people to invest R200 and earn R1, 000 profit.\n\nThe National Stokvel Association of SA (Nasasa) has warned South Africans that WhatsApp stokvels are most likely to be pyramid schemes rather than genuine savings vehicles \u2013 and those who have joined them have probably been scammed. Like most pyramid schemes, the first few to join received a pay-out, but those who followed often lost all their money.\n\nNasasa founder and chairperson, Andrew Lukhele, told TimesLive that scammers were using the popularity of stokvels to create pyramid schemes and take advantage of people.\n\nCompiled by Bombi Mavundza.", "description": "All a woman needs to do is tell them the kind of man wanted and the stokvel will do the rest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8987/594f260f59db44b18d2b5fb3c0bb3d60.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
