It was also a 27.8% year-over-year decline from the $1.87 per share earned a year ago.\n\nstocks to avoid More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nIn addition, sales of $20.25 billion missed expectations for $21.47 billion in sales. Although this was a 32.9% year-over-year increase from $15.22 billion, the company still reported a 5.7% sales miss.\n\nLooking forward, sales are forecasted to rise 35.5%, while the company\u2019s earnings are forecasted to decline 33.8%. In addition, analysts have lowered their estimates 26.9% in the past month. So, it does not look good for DIS.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCompany management placed the blame squarely on the acquisition of Fox Entertainment, which it bought for a whopping $71 billion back in March. This buyout was to help DIS launch its Disney+ service and put the company in better position to take on Netflix\u2018s (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) streaming services. (More on that in a moment.)\n\nThe stock fell 5% post-earnings, and while it has bounced back by about 2%, it\u2019s failed to regain any significant momentum. Shares continue to trade well below their 52-week high of $147.15.\n\nNot surprisingly, the weak earnings and sales earn Disney a D-rating for its Fundamental Grade in the Portfolio Grader. You can see its report card below.\n\nInterestingly, the stock still earns an A for its Quantitative Grade, as buying pressure remains strong. This is also why its Total Grade is a B. In my experience, buying pressure is the single most important variable when determining a stock\u2019s health (even more so than the fundamentals).\n\nHowever, I expect that buying pressure to start drying up soon and lower its Total Grade. Here\u2019s why \u2026\n\nFor one, the company has a big ESPN and Fox problem. NFL ratings remain low, and that hurts ESPN, which hurts Disney. And we\u2019re already seeing the impact the Fox Entertainment acquisition is having, given that company management blamed it for the weak results!\n\nWhile \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d made almost $3 billion in global sales in 13 weeks, \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d only made $65 million in sales domestically and $186 million in sales internationally, which isn\u2019t much considering the film\u2019s $200 million budget.\n\nDisney CFO Christine McCarthy stated that the \u201cfilm studio had an operating loss in the third quarter of about $170 million, which was driven by the underperformance of theatrical titles including \u2018Dark Phoenix,\u2019 marketing for future releases and development expenses.\u201d\n\nNow, if DIS has a great holiday movie season, it could soar; but I doubt it. Rather than creating new plot lines, they\u2019ve been making remake after remake. Why watch a \u201cnew\u201d remake when you can go to Netflix or Amazon for an original one instead?\n\nThe Importance of a Solid Quantitative and Fundamental Grade\n\nDisney\u2019s mixed report card is a perfect example of why it\u2019s so important to find companies with a strong Quantitative Grade and Fundamental Grade. This way, the stock will also have the fundamental support it needs to meander higher over the long term.\n\nWhile DIS doesn\u2019t fit the bill, my Growth Investor stocks sure do. All are highly rated, with strong sales and earnings momentum to drive them higher over time. These Growth Investor stocks are characterized by 16.7% annual sales growth and 65.6% annual earnings growth, as they did exceptionally well this earnings season.", "description": "The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) has lost a little magic this past month after its earnings report for the third-quarter fiscal year 2019 was a major flop.
