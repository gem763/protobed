(AP) - Two days after storm shutters started going up and people waited in long lines for gas and food in anticipation of Hurricane Dorian, the parking lot of a Home Depot a short drive from the beach in central Florida was nearly empty as the sun peeked out behind scattered clouds.\n\nMike Lafferty boarded up his house near Vero Beach days ago and was at the store to pick up a few more things. The waiting can be bothersome, but it beats being caught unprepared. The National Hurricane Center has a 60% chance of the area getting hurricane force winds before early Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not overkill. It\u2019s necessity. You don\u2019t know what is going to happen,\u201d Lafferty said. \u201cElectricity is going to go out sometime. You have to be ready for it.\u201d\n\nFrom Florida to North Carolina, residents and government officials have been preparing for possible impacts of Dorian for days, even as the official forecast has the center of the storm staying offshore. They started taking action Sunday. South Carolina ordered about 830,000 people to evacuate the state\u2019s coast beginning at noon EDT Monday.\n\nThe Category 5 hurricane\u2019s nearly unprecedented strength - the 185 mph (295 kph) winds made it the second strongest storm in the Atlantic Ocean since 1950 - has people aware that even a tiny error in the forecast could be catastrophic.\n\n\u201cWe have to be ready for it,\u201d said Neil Baxley, commander of emergency services in coastal South Carolina\u2019s Beaufort County. \u201cWe are deep in the error cone.\u201d\n\nThe gas lines and people queued up with carts outside grocery stores weren\u2019t seen Sunday along the southeast U.S. coast.\n\nInstead, people were watching and waiting to see the destruction from the northern Bahamas, where Dorian made landfall on the Abaco Islands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thanking God now that it has turned a little more to the east. But that\u2019s a forecast. We never know,\u201d said Kevin Browning, who was at the Vero Beach Home Depot looking for supplies after putting up his hurricane shutters Friday. \u201cI feel for the Bahamas and I\u2019m praying for them.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s governor suspended tolls on roads to help those seeking to leave.\n\nFarther up the coast, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said state troopers would start reversing lanes on major coastal roads so they all head inland Monday afternoon.\n\nMany of South Carolina\u2019s coastal residents are now evacuating for the fourth time in four years. Just one storm hit the state directly during that time - Matthew in 2016. McMaster addressed the storm weariness on Sunday evening as he announced the upcoming evacuations.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t make everybody happy. But we believe we can keep everyone alive,\u201d the governor said.\n\nEarlier in the day, McMaster said he understood the frustration with the waiting and uncertainty of Dorian\u2019s path.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a solid prediction as to where it might turn, where it might not turn when it will get here. But we assure you we have the best minds and the most experienced and talented people working around the clock,\u201d McMaster said.\n\nIn Florida, it was still the Labor Day holiday weekend, so folks headed to the beach. It wasn\u2019t as crowded as usual at Jacksonville Beach, and members of the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps were warning people not to go into the water.\n\n\u201cIt looks like business as usual, which is a little strange, but a lot of people are here from out of town they don\u2019t want the storm to ruin their Labor Day weekend,\u201d said volunteer lifeguard Mikey Atkins.\n\nGerry Heister has lived in Florida for 35 years and seen a lot of storms come through Vero Beach. \u201cFrances, Jeanne, Matthew and whatever the heck the others were,\u201d she said Sunday, trying to recall them all.\n\nShe said she has learned it is better to be prepared and the worst not happen then to be surprised and not ready.\n\n\u201cYou just prepare and then once it\u2019s gone, you get on with the rest of your life,\u201d Heister said.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the storm that made landfall in 2016 was Matthew.\n\n___\n\nCody Jackson in Jacksonville Beach and Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two days after storm shutters started going up and people waited in long lines for gas and food in anticipation of Hurricane Dorian, the parking lot of a Home Depot a short drive from the beach in central Florida was nearly empty as the sun peeked out behind scattered clouds.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Herbert"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/01/tropical-weather_99963_c0-213-5115-3195_s1770x1032.jpg?4a83331d31a7b603bc21bea997925aeb13865cbb"}
