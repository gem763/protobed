USA TODAY\n\nNew York Jets CEO Christopher Johnson seems to be feeling just like many of his team's fans these days: exasperated.\n\nBefore Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the New York Jets' acting owner was caught on tape talking to fans near the field, according to a video posted on Twitter.\n\nAnd his message was not the picture of confidence in the team.\n\n\"Hopefully the team actually shows up this week,\" Johnson can be heard saying on the video.\n\nThe Jets did not show up on Sunday, playing horribly throughout a 29-15 loss against the Jaguars as New York fell to 1-6.\n\n.@nyjets acting owner Christopher Johnson to a fan who told him they drove 9 hours to the game at Jacksonville yesterday: \u201cHopefully the team will actually show up this week.\u201d \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/VZU8dvNFox \u2014 uSTADIUM (@uSTADIUM) October 28, 2019\n\nWhat should we make of what Johnson said?\n\nLet's start with a couple of disclaimers: This was a five-second video posted to Twitter by an unnamed fan, and it seemed to cut off as Johnson was about to continue talking, so there's a chance that his remarks are less harsh in their full context.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that Johnson doesn't seem to know he's being recorded.\n\nStill, it's notable because it's the first sign that Johnson is not feeling so great about the drastic changes he made to the organization this offseason. He has not done an interview with reporters since May, on the day he fired then-GM Mike Maccagnan.\n\nThat was just one of several big moves Johnson made during the offseason, including firing coach Todd Bowles and replacing him with Adam Gase 10 months ago, and naming Joe Douglas as the team's GM in June.\n\nThe new regime put in place by Johnson is off to a rough start. And it's impossible to know if Johnson still has confidence in his plan because he hasn't done an interview session with reporters who cover the team in nearly six months.\n\nJets fans could get some answers about the direction of the franchise Tuesday, when Douglas is scheduled for a press conference after the trade deadline.\n\nBut until Johnson publicly explains how he feels about the current state of the team, those who follow the Jets closely will have to look for meaning in other places, like the fan video that emerged this week.", "description": "New York Jets CEO Christopher Johnson seems to be feeling just like many of his team's fans these days: exasperated.", "authors": ["Andy Vasquez", "Published A.M.
