Officials said the increase doesn\u2019t represent an immediate threat to public safety and isn\u2019t linked to Wednesday\u2019s 18th anniversary of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen lately, is an unusual amount of propaganda directed at attacks on U.S. soil and an unusual amount of that pointing to New York as a target,\u201d said John Miller, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism.\n\nIslamic State rose to power more than a decade ago amid instability in Iraq. The group controlled a self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq and Syria that was the size of Portugal at its peak, but collapsed this year after U.S.-backed Syrian forces defeated the last of its territories.\n\nMr. Miller said Islamic State\u2019s loss of geographical territory and manpower has led to a rise of propaganda.

But it has shifted its emphasis to reaching local extremists with propaganda meant to inspire individual attacks, the deputy commissioner said.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think Islamic State\u2019s propaganda means for the terrorist group\u2019s power? Join the conversation below.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t lost the technical ability to create new material, fresh propaganda and increase the volume on their calls for lone wolves to attack,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cIf one or two of these people decide to act on it, for ISIS, that is a win,\u201d he said, using an acronym for the group.\n\nRita Katz, the director of SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors and tracks radical groups online, said New York City remains a top target for terrorists because it \u201cembodies American culture, making it a highly symbolic location.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost propaganda featuring New York City isn\u2019t only a threat to the city itself, but also anywhere and everywhere in America,\u201d she said.\n\nThe last three Islamic terror attacks in New York City were executed by extremists motivated by such messaging, Mr. Miller said. That list includes Ahmad Khan Rahimi, who was convicted of detonating a bomb on a Manhattan sidewalk in 2016; Akayed Ullah, who was convicted of detonating a bomb in a Manhattan subway station in 2017; and Sayfullo Saipov, who is accused of using a truck to crush people on a bike path in lower Manhattan in 2017.\n\nMore recent arrests of individuals who are accused of planning attacks, including Ashiqul Alam, who allegedly planned an attack in Manhattan\u2019s Times Square, may also have been informed by Islamic State propaganda, Mr. Miller said.\n\nThe NYPD operates the largest counterterrorism apparatus of any law enforcement agency in the U.S., with hundreds of staff officers and analysts and extensive relationships with outside intelligence agencies.\n\nAnalysts in the NYPD\u2019s intelligence and counterterrorism units have encountered a growing number of messages encouraging attacks on soft targets such as the Thanksgiving Day Parade, holiday markets and public transit systems, including the subway, officials said.\n\nLikewise, analysts have discovered more propaganda that encourages violence against police. On Aug. 23, NYPD officials alerted precinct commanders and officers to two such messages with a tactical bulletin.\n\nThe bulletin said that two posters targeting NYPD were reported on a pro-Islamic State channel on the Telegram messaging app on Aug. 19, both of which displayed a blood drip-style font reading \u201cPigs! You will Soon Pay For Your Crimes.\u201d\n\nOne of the posters showed an image of an active NYPD officer. The officer was unharmed and was unaware the image had been used, officials said.\n\nNYPD Chief of Counterterrorism James Waters said the tactical assessment was delivered to officers to increase vigilance and to prompt conversation about terrorist threats in general.\n\n\u201cIt gave us yet another good opportunity to reach out to all the cops, review tactics and personal safety and give them awareness,\u201d Chief Waters said.\n\nWrite to Ben Chapman at Ben.Chapman@wsj.com", "description": "Islamic State has ramped up threats against New York City and New York Police Department officers in recent weeks, counterterrorism officials said in interviews.", "authors": ["Ben Chapman"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103997/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
