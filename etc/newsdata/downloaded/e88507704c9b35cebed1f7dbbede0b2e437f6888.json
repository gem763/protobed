It is now also the day that a fatal shooting took place outside a synagogue in Halle, Germany.\n\nOften referred to as the Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur is the final day of a 10 day period of repentance and reflection, when Jews undertake a complete fast for 25 hours, and spend most of the day in the synagogue, praying together.\n\nIt is the day when we meticulously list all the ways we may have fallen short of the mark, and ask God, in spite of our shortcomings, to inscribe us in \u2018the Book of Life\u2019 \u2013 granting us another full year of life in which to achieve our \u2018individual purpose\u2019 in the world\n\nConcerned that my words might be misinterpreted, I already find myself inserting the word \u2018individual\u2019 before purpose. Without it I worry people might fall for the age-old conspiracy theory, looking for undercurrents of Jewish supremacy, some proof that I\u2019ve let slip that Jews really do have some kind of evil grip on world events.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitial reports of material circulating online purported to be linked to the attack showed a clear conspiratorial anti-Semitic ideology.\n\nBut let\u2019s not kid ourselves that terrorism comes out of nowhere. It\u2019s at the top of the pyramid of hate, the worst manifestation of a sickness that starts with words, throwaway thoughtless comments, and \u2018banter.\u2019 As previous atrocities have shown, terrorists often draw inspiration from forums, websites and the words of people making racist threats.\n\nWhen I returned from my own synagogue last night, I broke my fast, turned my phone back on to check in with older relatives to make sure they were well, only to see the terrible news from Germany.\n\nMy Twitter feed was full of messages expressing shock and outrage, and oddly \u2013 to me at least \u2013 surprise.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I checked in with a non-Jewish colleague that my reaction to this started to make sense. He commented how eerie it was to see social media empty of Jewish voices after the attack.\n\nIt\u2019s time to unequivocally face the fact that anti-Jewish racism in this country, and across Europe, is rising (Picture: EPA/FILIP SINGER)\n\nEerie yes, but those people would most likely not have expressed the same sense of surprise.\n\nSadly, for anyone connected to the Jewish community, attacks or attempted attacks on Jewish targets are too regular an occurrence to be greeted with surprise.\n\nNon-Jews I know are often shocked to hear that pretty much everyone I know in the Jewish community knows someone who has been affected directly by terrorism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether in Israel, or in Toulouse, Copenhagen, Brussels, Pittsburgh, Poway and now Halle, tragically too many of us have direct experience of the real consequences of terror.\n\nWhen children in my community get verbally and physically abused while travelling home on the bus in their school uniform, when people I know make sweeping comments to my face about Jews and money, or about accusations of left-wing antisemitism being a smear campaign.\n\nWhen someone shouts \u2018Get out of Gaza\u2019 to me in the street, for no reason other than that I am visibly Jewish, this is part of normal life for me now. It was not like this 10 years ago.\n\nHistorically, Jewish communities have become accustomed to being vulnerable, and having to move on to avoid persecution or even death. The idea of having a passport to hand and a suitcase packed is often pooh-poohed in today\u2019s age, but European Jewish identity in particular is built on the reality of centuries of persecution.\n\nAs the old saying goes, there\u2019s a reason Jews learn to play the violin and not the piano \u2013 it\u2019s easier to pack it up and take it with you.\n\nThat\u2019s why in 2019, someone like me, living an unquestionably comfortable middle-class life, is fearful. The rise in antisemitic sentiment, wherever it comes from politically, however it manifests, whether in words and slurs or in bullets and bombs, and wherever the victims live, whether in my immediate community or across the world, gives me a fearful knot in my stomach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI don\u2019t look like a victim, I certainly try not to live as a victim, but that is my reality in 2019.\n\nThe only question is how we all, collectively, respond. It\u2019s time to unequivocally face the fact that anti-Jewish racism in this country, and across Europe, is rising.\n\nWe all have a part to play in challenging it wherever we see it, and however we see it manifest itself. History has taught us that being a bystander is not an option.\n\nIt\u2019s no longer acceptable to deny the problem, or to passively leave the Jewish community \u2013 any more than any other minority community \u2013 to face this alone.\n\nThe problem is real, and the time for all of us to stand together and make a difference is now.\n\nMORE: The fight against alt-right white nationalism has only just begun\n\nMORE: Grandfather, 71, first victim of synagogue shooting named by family\n\nMORE: Teachers are at the frontline of the struggle against the rise of the far right", "description": "On the holiest day of the Jewish year a fatal shooting took place outside a synagogue in Germany, killing two.", "authors": ["Jemma Levene", "Deputy Director At Hope Not Hate"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_89176908_1570723830.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
