He possesses both a genial smile that can light up a room and a down-to-earth grubbiness that reminds you he's not nearly as perfect as some of those Herculean Chrises he fights evil alongside in Marvel films.\n\nSo when he plays, in Netflix's new high-concept comedy \"Living With Yourself,\" a depressed, inert man nearing middle age who accidentally winds up with a sexier, smarter and more energetic clone, it's hard to imagine the series would be nearly as successful without him.\n\nPaul Rudd stars in a scene from Netflix's \"Living with Yourself.\" (Photo: Netflix)\n\nCreated by Timothy Greenberg (\"The Daily Show,\" \"Wyatt Cenac's Problem Areas\"), \"Yourself\" (streaming Friday, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd out of four) is a dark comedy about different sides of a person, but also marriage, careerism, lies, chemistry and jealousy. It's an intimate character study of one man \u2013 or two, sort of \u2013 who doesn't know what to do with life until life happens to him. It's inspirational and deeply sad at the same time.\n\nMiles Elliott is a man in a rut. He has a supportive wife, Kate (Aisling Bea), and a job at a marketing firm that's enough to help him win awards and buy a nice house in the New York suburbs. But he's struggling: Fighting fertility problems, tensions with Kate and a creative roadblock at the office has made him tired, bland and depressed. His marriage and career are on the brink of collapse, mostly due to his apathy and lack of motivation to attend an important fertility doctor's appointment or work on a big pitch.\n\nAll the Paul Rudd you need: Actor can't contain his excitement, or slime, after joining 'Ghostbusters' reboot\n\nWhen he sees his once listless co-worker Dan (Desmin Borges, \"You're the Worst\") has found renewed energy and purpose, he learns the secret lies in a mysterious strip mall \"spa treatment\" (the massage parlor jokes abound) that costs $50,000. Desperate, Miles empties the couple's savings account and heads to the spa, actually an illegal cloning outfit that makes \"better men\" by cloning them into highly productive duplicates and then murdering and burying the originals.\n\nIn Miles' case, the murder part goes awry, leaving him and New Miles (also Rudd, obviously) to hash out who gets what part of the \"Miles Elliot\" life.\n\nPaul Rudd stars in a scene from Netflix's \"Living with Yourself.\" (Photo: Netflix)\n\nWhile the series has plenty of seeing double high jinks, its tone is far darker than you might expect. This isn't a \"Freaky Friday\"-style TV show where the supernatural is an impetus for better understanding and happier families. Really looking at yourself in a mirror can be frightening and somber, and as New Miles succeeds where Original Miles failed, resentment builds toward anger and violence.\n\nIn both roles, Rudd is doing some of his best work. The script and his wide-ranging performances make it never quite clear which Miles the audience is meant to be rooting for, inviting sympathy (and disdain) for both. Rudd is nearly outshined by Bea, an Irish actress who appears infrequently until halfway through the season when her character and skill are unleashed to great effect. The small supporting cast adds much-needed comic relief, as does a pitch-perfect celebrity cameo that is one of television's best casting coups of late.\n\nPaul Rudd stars in a scene from Netflix's \"Living with Yourself.\" (Photo: Eric Liebowitz, Netflix)\n\nThe conflicting tones, an echo of the conflicted Mileses, makes \"Yourself' a sometimes cringe-inducing, uncomfortable watch. But it runs the gamut from awkward to deeply moving, and its philosophizing is neither pretentious nor pat, raising questions about what makes us a person nestled into quippy dialogue and absurd plot twists. It may make you think about the very idea of existence, but it will also give you the sight gag of Rudd running through the woods in a diaper.\n\nAnd, as basic Hollywood math has taught us, Rudd in a diaper is better than no Rudd at all.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/18/living-with-yourself-review-two-paul-rudds-netflix/3995422002/", "description": "Paul Rudd does double duty as a man and his clone in Netflix's lightly sci-fi comedy \"Living With Yourself\" that is far deeper than you'd expect.", "authors": ["Kelly Lawler", "Published A.M.
