So We Had One.", "language": "en", "text": "From Slave Play, now transferred to the Golden Theatre. Photo: Matthew Murphy\n\nI first saw Jeremy O. Harris\u2019s Slave Play at New York Theater Workshop last December. Since then\u2014or, since even before I saw it\u2014it\u2019s been the center of a constant churn of hype, opinion, and, at times, enraged contention. Harris\u2019s write-ups from white critics, myself included, have mostly enthusiastically added fuel to the rocket of the play\u2019s ascent. At the same time, the playwright has fielded intense online backlash from parts of the black community. The buzzworthy incidents have only continued with the show\u2019s transfer to Broadway: Rihanna recently saw the play, and the internet decided to @ her for texting during it (she was texting Harris). On September 18th, Slave Play\u2019s team saved all 804 seats at the Golden Theatre for black theatergoers only \u2014 and they filled the house. For the show\u2019s Broadway transfer, the Playbill includes a new cautionary epigraph by the writer Morgan Parker. It\u2019s called \u201cA Note on Your Discomfort,\u201d and it begins, \u201cThis might hurt.\u201d\n\nThere are still many more white critics than there are critics of color writing about art in all its forms at the most visible outlets, and in revisiting Slave Play, I felt that I didn\u2019t simply want to re-review the play \u2014 to add another solo opinion to the overcrowded ether. So what follows is a conversation. This time around, I saw the play with Taylor Barfield, a dramaturg and theater-maker from Baltimore. We went to grad school together (the same school Harris attended, though we didn\u2019t overlap), and Taylor currently serves as the literary manager for Two River Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey. He\u2019s also working on his dissertation, which explores, in his words, \u201chow contemporary African-American playwrights re-imagine and re-stage black theater history.\u201d The day after seeing the show together, we spent more than three hours on Google chat \u2014 much like the characters in Harris\u2019s play, in slow, precarious pursuit of the words for our feelings.\n\nSara Holdren: There was something I said to you outside the theater, after the show last night: This is a play where the word \u201cconversation\u201d comes up a lot in its orbit. \u201cWhat an important part of the conversation\u201d; \u201cIt will start such important conversations\u201d \u2014 and yet, I realized that I haven\u2019t really gotten to have any conversations about it. Each time that I\u2019ve seen it, I\u2019ve felt very isolated \u2014 on an island with my own shifting response to it.\n\nTaylor Barfield: I deeply feel that. I think there\u2019s something about the play that leads each individual audience member down a path of introspection that can be incredibly fear-inducing and insular. I know each time I\u2019ve experienced the thing\u2014I\u2019ve seen it three times now, definitely not something I thought I would do\u2014I\u2019ve left wanting to have a million conversations with myself, but a little tentative to have them with other people.\n\nS.H.: Exactly \u2014 it leaves you in an ongoing feedback loop inside your own brain. And, at least for me, doing a lot of second-guessing of my own impulses. Even feeling semi-paralyzed. This time around, I find myself trying to work through this visceral feeling of isolation just as much as I\u2019m working through the play itself. I think I\u2019m left wondering: Does this play prescribe something about how to go forward as a human being in the world with other human beings? Or does it avoid prescription?\n\nT.B.: I think lack of clarity is exactly right for this play. So much of it involves the process of interrogating our own impulses, beliefs, and thoughts on the rawest of levels. This time, knowing the overall structure of the play a bit better after two sit-downs with it, I found myself doing a very similar thing: trying to reconcile my gut emotions with the thoughts racing in my head and the thoughts and emotions of the characters portrayed onstage. It induces that symptom that the characters talk about \u2014 alexithymia, the inability to describe one\u2019s own feelings.\n\nS.H.: Yes, it does! The play has three movements: a first in which we witness three strange, troubling (and at times intensely funny) sexual duets on what appears to be an antebellum plantation; a second where (spoiler alert!) we realize that all these pairs are in fact contemporary interracial couples, engaged in roleplay sex therapy; and a third in which one of those couples, in the wake of the \u201cslave play\u201d they\u2019ve engaged in, comes to a place of eviscerating rawness and potential revelation. And in the second of those movements\u2014the one I think of as \u201cThe Talkback\u201d\u2014that idea of alexithymia comes up constantly. The two researchers, Te\u00e1 (Chalia La Tour) and Patricia (Irene Sofia Lucio) point to it as a key symptom of the particular kind of crisis each of the black partners in these three relationships is facing \u2014 an aspect of their anhedonia, their inability to feel pleasure, or really anything, anymore with their white lovers.\n\nT.B.: For me, I\u2019ve always seen this play as a scientist\u2019s bench. It recognizes that there are these very fucked up and pervasive dynamics occurring in 2019 in relation to race, sex, and power that we each individually have to acknowledge (and not just in a facile \u201cI see you\u201d way) if there\u2019s any chance to move forward and heal together or apart.\n\nS.H.: It\u2019s the scientific research\u2014the digging into the psyche\u2014that leads to a reckoning. It\u2019s also what allows Harris to toggle back and forth between comedy and the very-not-funny so quickly. The play has such a nimble, energetic grasp on the buzzwordy conflict-resolution speak of the two moderators \u2014 it\u2019s satirical but it\u2019s also very real. We laugh at it, but the play doesn\u2019t mock it.\n\nT.B.: The play has such a strong handle on how language, research, philosophy, modes of understanding are in themselves constructions. And a sizable piece of the work (all hail Rihanna) is to observe something in an open way, especially when you want to look away \u2014 or to explain it away from your own perspective, define it and pretend that your definition holds the capital-T-truth, no exceptions. I love that moment when Alana (Annie McNamara) freaks the fuck out after hearing Phillip\u2019s (Sullivan Jones) revelation and yells, \u201cIs this even a real study!?\u201d\n\nS.H.: Something that\u2019s happened in my brain\u2014and my heart too\u2014both times I\u2019ve seen the show is a painful, indecipherable blur between the idea of systems and the experience of individuals. The terrible challenge of shuttling back and forth between the acknowledgement of these systemic horrors\u2014these things that are programmed into us or handed down to us or ingrained or institutionalized or whatever words we choose\u2014and the daily, delicate question of just\u2026 how to be a person in the world. How to care for another person. It\u2019s probably naive, but I do find myself so saddened by the idea that all the couples in the play\u2014and, by implication, all these communities and identities\u2014potentially end in complete rupture. But I also recognize that the play may be pointing towards that rupture as a vital step, a break that has to happen in order to shake us out of shallow listening. Something can\u2019t be rebuilt if we keep pretending it isn\u2019t broken in the first place.\n\nT.B.: I agree with the sadness and I still don\u2019t feel like I have any concrete answers. Acknowledgment is a step that many Americans, both black and white, won\u2019t make. They\u2019ll deny, deny, deny until they feel good. Last night, I found myself continuously going back to this quote by the playwright Carlyle Brown. He said in an interview, \u201cIt\u2019s interesting the way we as Americans remember ourselves, remember what our history is and what we\u2019re disconnected to. And we\u2019re always working the narrative so we\u2019re coming out to being the good people. We\u2019re not a very self-reflective culture.\u201d I don\u2019t think we live in a world where the majority of people honestly reflect on themselves or listen to what other people are telling them. Without that, there\u2019s not even a modicum of chance to move forward.\n\nS.H.: It\u2019s funny \u2014 I\u2019ve thought about self-reflection a lot in the past two years \u2014 god, what a sentence\u2026\n\nT.B.: Ha, that should be the new tagline for criticism: \u201cI think about self-reflection a lot.\u201d\n\nS.H.: Well, yes, exactly! I think public self-reflection is actually one way of describing the job. Because criticism is actually always, under the surface, self-criticism. You\u2019re interrogating yourself and your assumptions through the lens of a piece of art. That amazing Carlyle Brown quotation, though \u2014 I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve necessarily considered an aversion to self-reflection (or even a flat out denial of it) as a specifically cultural phenomenon. But it makes an eerie kind of sense to me. It reminds me of another quotation\u2014it\u2019s sometimes attributed to Steinbeck\u2014about why Americans will never accept Socialism: It\u2019s because we don\u2019t think of ourselves as a manipulated, mistreated proletariat, but as \u201ctemporarily embarrassed millionaires.\u201d\n\nT.B.: Woof. To quote The Good Place, I like to think of myself as \u201cpre-successful.\u201d\n\nS.H.: But that idea of a cultural story that we tell ourselves, and how it becomes an individual story \u2014 \u201cWe are the Good Guys\u201d; \u201cI am a Good Person.\u201d And how that traps us \u2014 keeps us burrowing deeper and deeper into our habits, our safe spaces, our harmful and worn out policies.\n\nT.B.: I think that narrativization (definitely not a word) operates with black and white identity formation as well. I hearken to the debate between Dustin (James Cusati-Moyer) and Gary (Ato Blankson-Wood) in the play about who\u2019s \u201cwhiter.\u201d Is it Gary, who is phenotypically black, but enjoys the comforts of a gentrified neighborhood, such as bookstores and fancy coffee shops, etc? Or is it Dustin, who\u2019s ethnically ambiguous, but could definitely pass for white if he wasn\u2019t yelling every ten second that he isn\u2019t white? There are these narratives and actions associated with blackness and whiteness that prevent us individually from self-reflection. I think many of us (myself included) will come up to an uncomfortable impulse and say to ourselves, \u201cWell that\u2019s because I\u2019m black, or I\u2019m Asian, or I\u2019m a man\u201d \u2014 when really it\u2019s a tangled mess of all of those things.\n\nS.H.: Yes, a tangle and not a hierarchy. I think this is why the phrase \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d sometimes bothers me. There can be this feeling (and I think this comes up in those lines of Dustin\u2019s and Gary\u2019s about being able to \u201ctouch whatever you want\u201d if you\u2019re white and \u201csay whatever you want\u201d if you\u2019re black) that one is constantly trying to separate the molecules in the solutions that are ourselves and make sure that we\u2019re only letting the least historically privileged ones float to the top to do the speaking. I can speak as a Woman, but as a White Person, I\u2019d better keep quiet. Straight White Men had better keep the absolute quietest. I actually think Slave Play starts to dig into why that mandate isn\u2019t necessarily useful: When Jim (Paul Alexander Nolan)\u2014the white British guy who\u2019s been so closed off and hostile the whole time\u2014shows up in the play\u2019s final third and tells his wife Kaneisha (Joaquina Kalukango)\u2014who\u2019s black and whose personal arc of revelation becomes the engine of the play\u2014that he\u2019s only there to listen to her, it\u2019s still not real listening for a long time. It\u2019s still a frightened, defensive mode of listening that comes from a place of, \u201cWell, the only thing I\u2019ve figured out is that I shouldn\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\nT.B.: I think this goes back to language and how it\u2019s deployed and from where. In actuality, \u201cchecking your privilege\u201d is supposed to mean, \u201cHey, the way in which many in the world see you may have altered the way you see the world in a way that limits how you observe and interact with the world.\u201d Somehow, it\u2019s been reduced in practice to the dynamic you describe: \u201cI better not say anything.\u201d Well, just because you\u2019re not saying anything doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re listening and not just waiting for your chance to defend or say your piece. Listening is hard work. That\u2019s why they called it \u201cactive listening\u201d back in the day. I think it gets even harder to listen the closer you get to trauma.\n\nS.H.: Yes. Straining for the signal inside a lot of static.\n\nT.B.: Which goes back to the acute musical disorder that Te\u00e1 and Patricia describe \u2014 the way that Kaneisha and Gary are constantly hearing a specific song. Kaneisha describes it best in the last third of the play.\n\nS.H.: Right \u2014 the constant dull roar in the back of your head that sharpens up horribly in certain moments. The presence of ghosts.\n\nT.B.: The presence of your ancestors in the walls, in the ground, and in your body. This will probably be a malformed thought, but history has a way of dulling the sound of your ancestors\u2019 voices in many cases. The vestiges of your ancestors live on in often surprising ways, but when you try to go back and imagine your ancestors, it\u2019s often mediated through your own experience.\n\nS.H.: The first time I wrote about Slave Play, I thought about this Samuel Butler quotation: \u201cIt is one against legion when a creature tries to differ from his own past selves.\u201d Now it strikes me that that quotation might actually contain the exact blurring of identities/experiences that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 ancestors are not in fact past selves, but they start to blur into that. They are and they aren\u2019t.\n\nT.B.: We\u2019re about to get into a quote-off, because that reminds me of a Ta-Nehisi Coates quote from Between the World and Me, when he writes to his son: \u201cSlavery is not an indefinable mass of flesh. It is a particular, specific enslaved woman, whose mind is as active as your own, whose range of feeling is as vast as your own.\u201d I think we fashion our ancestors as past-selves, as you suggest, when in fact they were fully subjective individuals living in a past that is difficult for us to fully comprehend, but that we feel the effects of in our contemporary life.\n\nS.H.: I know you\u2019ve got to go! And that this isn\u2019t a conversation that has any sort of end. But thank you. I can\u2019t help thinking that finding antidotes for the kind of isolation we both experienced in the wake of the play is a good thing. That, no matter one\u2019s fears of sounding inarticulate or privileged or just plain wrong, or no matter the impulse to keep processing silently on one\u2019s own \u2014 it\u2019s good to take a step towards tackling the alexithymia.\n\nT.B.: I concur. Perhaps it\u2019s the tiny optimist in my head that believes honestly working to articulate difficult concepts brings us closer to something we can do to heal on an individual level, in our relationships, and in the broader world. In all of the things this play does well, I think it\u2019s best at eliciting a reaction to uneasy dynamics in some of the deepest, darkest, most generationally traumatic aspects of one\u2019s psyche \u2014 and then it almost forces you to speak on it, even if it\u2019s just to yourself.\n\nSlave Play is at the Golden Theatre.", "description": "Theater Review of Jeremy O.
