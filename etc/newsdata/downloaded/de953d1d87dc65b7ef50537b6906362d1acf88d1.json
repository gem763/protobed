I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the most innocent person in the world.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nTRUMP: But you know you look at that \u2014 most presidential, I just said I\u2019m the most presidential except for possibly Abe Lincoln when he wore the hat \u2014 that was tough to beat.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nHonest Abe, when he wore that hat, that was tough to beat. But I can\u2019t do that, that hat wouldn\u2019t work for me. Yeah, I have better hair than him. But Honest Abe was tough to beat. Remember we used to do that during the campaign. They used to say, when I speak, the crowd would be crazy, I\u2019d go crazy \u2014 we would all go crazy. We had a lot of fun together. We had 25,000 \u2014 We\u2019ve never had an empty seat. From the day I came down the escalator, with a potential \u2014 unbelievable woman who became a first lady.\n\n(Applause)\n\nThe crowds loved her, the people love her.\n\nBut we\u2019ve never had an empty seat, not one. I really believe that. There was one case where we had a tremendous snowstorm, and it was just about frozen. It was like a monster storm, I don\u2019t even know how it got there. I said, \u201chow\u2019s the crowd?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just not full, sir.\u201d I said what does that mean. There\u2019s like two seats on top. Thousands and thousands of people couldn\u2019t get there. So they show pictures of the empty seats. The worst storm they\u2019ve had in years. They show pictures of like nine empty seats. They could have been people just went to the bathroom together.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nI always say just get the biggest arena. Good location if you can, but get the biggest arena. We did it the other night, Tuesday night. We had two congressmen, one who was possibly going to win, he was up by two, he won by about 27, I think, or something like that. A lot. The other one was down by 17. And they said, \u201cSir, don\u2019t campaign for him please.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cBecause if he loses, they\u2019re going to kill you, the press.\u201d I said they\u2019re going to kill me whether I campaign or not. It\u2019ll make it a little bit worse. They\u2019ll say he worked and he failed. Trump failed. The guy was down 17 points and he ended up winning by a lot. In fact, the whole night, CNN. . . (inaudible)\n\nTRUMP: The studio was going to stay up for weeks, and toward the end of the night they were taking it down. Their so-called stars were leaving. They don\u2019t have many stars. But they were taking \u2014 the stars were leaving. The candidate Dan Bishop won by a lot. He was down by 17, and they had lines a mile long. I mean the lines going into those voting booths were unbelievable. And without the rally speech, and a couple of tweets and Twitter stuff is good. We have like way over 100 million people on six or seven different platforms. It\u2019s actually much higher than that, higher than just about everybody. And it helps. It helps. They have signs oftentimes when I speak. This woman the other night, beautiful woman, she\u2019s got a son: \u201cPlease keep tweeting sir, it matters.\u201d And it does matter, because we get our voice out. If we don\u2019t do that, we don\u2019t get the voice out.\n\nI can\u2019t say what a great job Kelly []Kraft] is doing, and I can\u2019t say what a wonderful husband he is. Look at how devoted he is. He\u2019s a rich man, too. He\u2019s loaded. What are you doing here? Why are you working? He\u2019s so proud of his wife he can\u2019t leave his office. That\u2019s really great though, huh? Are you all proud of her? He said very much. And he\u2019s really a fantastic guy, he\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time. Before I met Kelly, I met Joe [Kraft]. And Joe impressed me because of his knowledge of energy. Now he could be paid \u2014 O.K., you\u2019re going to pay a guy 50 \u2014 for him that\u2019s not quite good enough, although he might. He might. It\u2019s easy money, Joe, you have to say. But he would be an expert on energy, he would be a real expert. He would be somebody you would pay a lot of money to, but not Joe Biden\u2019s son.", "description": "President Trump made remarks to the United States Mission to the United Nations on Thursday, the same day a House committee released a declassified version of a complaint.", "authors": ["The New York Times"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/vid26-whistle-blower/vid26-whistle-blower-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
