It\u2019s also the first test of black support after primaries and caucuses in predominantly white Iowa and New Hampshire and Latino-heavy Nevada.\n\nBiden has enjoyed overwhelming support from black voters in the state, and Buttigieg\u2019s swing through the state was part of an effort to reach out to voters he\u2019d not made inroads with so far.\n\n\u201cI tremble for my country knowing how difficult it has become for us to stand together,\u201d Buttigieg said, as he shed his prepared remarks and described a \u201ccrisis of belonging.\u201d\n\nFocus on Vision\n\nButtigieg centered his speech on his vision for the country.\n\n\u201cWe will be a country even more torn up around politics, even more divided, even more hurting than we are right now,\u201d he said about the days after Donald Trump is no longer in office.\n\nButtigieg, whose plan for black Americans is named after the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, spoke about the need to address systemic issues. He referenced disparities in maternal health and incarceration rates between blacks and whites.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about the problems that have affected the black community,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is about the solutions that I have seen with my own eyes in our community coming from within the black community. That\u2019s why economic empowerment must be at the top of our list.\u201d\n\nA number of congregants stood and applauded after Buttigieg spoke.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden attended services at the Jerusalem Baptist Church in Hartsville, where he sang along with the attendees, was greeted with a standing ovation, and was introduced by Pastor Reginald Ford as a \u201cgiant of a man.\u201d He stayed after services for 45 minutes, hugging and greeting parishioners.\n\n\u2018Didn\u2019t Over-Promise\u2019\n\nWill Hinton, a 68-year-old resident of Rock Hill, said he appreciated the conciseness of Buttigieg\u2019s remarks while still covering important issues. Hinton is leaning toward supporting Biden, but he said he\u2019s considering Buttigieg, among others.\n\n\u201cI like that he didn\u2019t over-promise,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he did is, he knew it\u2019s not a one-man show. He knows you have to include everyone.\u201d\n\nButtigieg\u2019s Douglass Plan aims to \u201cdismantle racist structures and systems\u201d and calls for a range of criminal justice reforms including abolishing the death penalty, reducing sentences for drug offenses, and legalizing marijuana.\n\nStill, Buttigieg may have trouble winning over black voters. His mayoral record on racial justice has drawn criticism and he got low marks for his handling of racial tensions after a white police officer killed an unarmed black man in South Bend.\n\nFocus Group\n\nButtigieg, moreover, is gay, and his sexual orientation may be a hurdle, as evidenced by a focus group of black voters in South Carolina convened by the Buttigieg campaign that found that his marriage to a man was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d for some voters. McClatchy\u2019s State newspaper of Colombia, South Carolina, first reported on the results of the focus group.\n\nA 2017 Pew Research Center poll showed the share of African Americans who favor same sex marriage was 51%. That\u2019s up from 39% in 2015, but lagged the 62% support among Americans overall.\n\nButtigieg didn\u2019t directly address his marriage on Sunday. But he made a subtle reference to his personal experience with discrimination.\n\n\u201cI know what it is to look on the news and see your rights up for debate,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of us must extend a hand to one another.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t Prefer That\u2019\n\nMarshall Leslie, 73, complimented Buttigieg\u2019s speech, saying the mayor showed \u201ca compassionate heart not for some people but for all people.\u201d\n\nBut when Leslie found out Buttigieg was gay and married to a man, he paused. \u201cI don\u2019t prefer that,\u201d he said. Leslie, a resident of Lawndale, North Carolina, said that would likely deter him from voting for Buttigieg in the primary, and he would be unsure about supporting him in a general election.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Pete Buttigieg went straight to the heart of Joe Biden\u2019s support in South Carolina on Sunday, bringing a message of healing and unity to a black church.The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, dressed in a crisp blue suit, joined parishioners in prayer at an African Methodist Episcopal", "authors": ["Tyler Pager"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RpzwFl37y5fwEtEHJ8BmVg--~B/aD0xNDY3O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/a681074d3351c9016e7fb0e48fbdec7f", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
