It won\u2019t hit theaters until Nov. 15, but it\u2019s already drawn strong reviews and been drafted into this fall\u2019s awards season after first debuting at the Telluride Film Festival last week. For Damon, such talk is too early, especially for a movie made with the intention of reaching a mass audience.\n\n\u201cI read the script and I thought it was a crowd-pleasing movie in all the right ways - like a movie that people would want to go see,\u201d said Damon. \u201cThat\u2019s what we made. It\u2019s just a great underdog story.\u201d\n\n\u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d dramatizes the Ford Motor Co.\u2019s drive to dethrone the reigning power of international racing, Ferrari, at the 1966 Les Mans, the classic 24-hour endurance race. Damon plays automotive designer Carroll Shelby; Bale plays the headstrong driver Ken Miles. It\u2019s a movie about obsession and drive, in which Shelby and Miles are often chafing at the constricting corporate dictates of Ford.\n\nMangold sees his movie, also, as an effort to battle a dominant force.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel, at least inside my own body, that there\u2019s an exhaustion with the kind of superhero-tentpole movie and all the tropes of them,\u201d said Mangold. \u201cCertainly \u2018Logan\u2019 was my response. I wasn\u2019t just trying to make a Western disguised as a superhero movie. I was also trying to make an original superhero movie.\u201d\n\nThe 55-year-old Mangold (\u201cWalk the Line,\u201d \u201d3:10 to Yuma\u201d) has made a career out of directing a disappearing breed of movie: studio films aimed at adults. Before \u201cJoker\u201d was winning plaudits for rewriting the superhero film, Mangold\u2019s gritty, unadorned take on Wolverine, \u201cLogan,\u201d became the first superhero film to earn an Oscar nomination for its writing.\n\n\u201cFord v Ferrari,\u201d costing close to $100 million to make, is a potentially risky project for 20th Century Fox, which after producing the film was acquired by the Walt Disney Co. After disappointing results for Fox\u2019s initial releases under its new parent company (\u201cDark Phoenix,\u201d \u201dStuber\u201d), \u201cFord v Ferrari\u201d may turn the tide.\n\nBut as Shelby initially tells Ford\u2019s Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal), \u201cYou can\u2019t buy a win.\u201d Yet you can, Shelby says, pay the right people to give you a shot at winning.\n\n\u201cOur goal and all our money was put toward trying to make as analog a film as possible,\u201d said Mangold. \u201cWe tried to do it for real. Our actors could drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t want to make a CG race film. Of course, there are visual effects working on the film. But the front-and-center race is something we physically mounted,\u201d he added. \u201cIn that sense, I\u2019m an avowed traditionalist.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "As a big-budget original movie made largely with practical effects, \"Ford v Ferrari\" isn't so much pointed against headwinds in Hollywood as it is speeding 200 miles-per-hour right into them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Coyle"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/09/2019_tiff_-__ford_v_ferrari__premiere_00499_c0-176-3225-2056_s1770x1032.jpg?29c8de4633c0b2df44b7e868b2ebb3612a12b34e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
