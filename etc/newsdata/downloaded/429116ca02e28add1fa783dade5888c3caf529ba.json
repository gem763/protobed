Its soul", "language": "en", "text": "James is arguably Nike\u2019s biggest star. He has been outspoken in supporting athletes kneeling during the national anthem, which he defends as free speech, outspoken on American police abusing power, outspoken on minorities being marginalized by government forces.\n\nWell? How does all that not apply to those protesting in Hong Kong? You can flip to any number of videos right now and see them beaten, hosed, tear-gassed.\n\nAnd you can bet if a Chinese athlete at a major national event got down on his knees during China\u2019s national anthem, he\u2019d be facing a whole lot more than booing.\n\nSo will James speak out when he and his L.A. Lakers teammates return from China and those now controversial exhibition games? Or will he sit mute like Harden did, like others in the NBA are doing, because they\u2019re all afraid of disrupting the giant money cart that China represents?", "description": "", "authors": ["Mitch Albom", "Freep.Com Story Sports Columnists Mitch-Albom Mitch-Albom-Nba-China-Houston-Rockets"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
