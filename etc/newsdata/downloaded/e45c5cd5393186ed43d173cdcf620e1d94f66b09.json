However, former ESPN host Jemele Hill saw Romney\u2019s concern an example of trying to keep black people down.\n\nSpeaking to ESPN\u2019s Outside the Lines, Romney worried that allowing the endorsement deals may present some unforeseen consequences.\n\nRomney went on to insist that Congress may have to act to try and make sure unfair conditions aren\u2019t created.\n\n\u201cWe recognize it\u2019s just not fair to have these athletes giving the kind of time they give to their sport, and not receiving any kind of compensation or remuneration, particularly at a time when they come from very, very poor families in many cases,\u201d Romney said.\n\nBut Romney went on to note that there could be problems with the idea of limiting athlete pay to those popular enough to get endorsement deals .\n\n\u201cBut, look what you can\u2019t have is a couple of athletes on campus driving around in Ferraris when everybody else is basically having a hard time making ends meet. And you can\u2019t have a setting where some schools that are in major markets or have big sport followings, some schools are like the honey pot, and everybody, all the great athletes all want to go to those handful of schools. And then you kill collegiate sports. So, there needs to be some adjustment to the whole \u2018name, image, and likeness\u2019 approach to make sure that we don\u2019t create those problems.\u201d\n\nJemele Hill, though, found Sen. Romney\u2019s reply to be an example of punishing blacks for their success.\n\n\u201cConservatives are forever hollering about a free market and capitalism, and yet\u2026,\u201d Hill tweeted on Wednesday, adding, \u201cI just think it\u2019s funny how whenever there is something that could possibly benefit black people, suddenly it\u2019s not fair to everybody else. But go off @MittRomney.\u201d\n\nConservatives are forever hollering about a free market and capitalism, and yet\u2026.
