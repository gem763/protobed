In this occasional series, the show zooms in on the big issues around climate and sustainability with its signature mix of compelling interviews, expert journalism and lively debate.\n\nThis episode is all about cities and features interviews with Amanda Eichel, executive director of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy and Anna K\u00f6nig Jerlmyr, the mayor of Stockholm & president of EUROCITIES. The Swedish capital is growing fast but shrinking its emissions \u2014 by 58 percent since 1990 \u2014 at the same time.\n\nThe podcast panel dives into the Yellow Jackets, talk of a Green Wave in European politics, and asks why Manfred Weber, the center-right candidate to be the next European Commission president, is missing from the climate debate.\n\nAre we headed for climate disaster, and is the EU the solution?\n\nSix Members of the European Parliament from across the political spectrum and around the Continent debated the question, and others, at the recent POLITICO European Elections Great Debate. Ryan Heath hosted the debate, which took place on April 2 in Brussels, between Mark Demesmaeker, Fredrick Federley, Jo Leinen, Maris.\n\nFor EU Green Week and EU Public Health Week, we go to an issue at the intersection of those themes: air quality.\n\nIn the latest edition of our occasional EU Confidential Goes Green series, our feature interview is with Zolt\u00e1n Massay-Kosubek of the European Public Health Alliance. And the regular podcast panel of Alva Finn and Lina Aburous are joined by POLITICO's Kalina Oroschakoff to debate what works and what doesn't when it comes to improving our air.\n\nThe World Health Organisation attributes up to 7 million deaths annually to air pollution.\n\nThe topic is getting political too, thanks to scandals like Dieselgate. And people are turning to a growing number of devices and apps that tell them exactly how exposed they are to the dangers. The EU is at the heart of these discussions: a would-be enforcer that with a patchy record and oversight over contradictory monitoring systems.\n\nHere\u2019s another thing to consider: Unlike other deadly things you can breathe, like cigarette smoke, it\u2019s a lot harder for individuals to control their exposure to air pollution. We explore these ideas and more in this week's podcast.\n\nIn our brand new podcast episode, we take a look at the greening of Europe\u2019s political mainstream.\n\nThe European Commission brought together a bunch of experts this week to talk sustainable finance \u2014 and two of our reporters went along to reality-check whether capitalism really can save the planet. In the latest in our occasional series focusing on green issues, hear interviews with some of the conference participants, including the Commission\u2019s financial markets chief.\n\nOn the podcast panel, we talk about the countries who came out for and against the 2050 climate-neutrality target discussed at last week\u2019s EU summit. And away from the green theme, our panellists pick apart the rights and wrongs of the media coverage of Boris Johnson\u2019s row with his partner.\n\nThis week we\u2019re going green again: Ryan Heath talks to Kristian Ruby, who runs Eurelectric and the Electrification Alliance, a group of more than 50 organizations promoting a shift to electricity from green sources as a way to clean our energy systems. (Ruby has also been on a roadshow tour touting the wonders of electrification.) After that, POLITICO's Anca Gurzu takes a hydrogen-powered car for a wild test drive to Amsterdam (or not, as it turns out) and back again.\n\nAll the talk of green transformation is a world away from where the EU started: as a coal and steel-trading community. After the greenest EU election ever, it seems the big political question for most of Europe is no longer whether to go green, but how fast we should get there.\n\nWe also have a very special podcast panel this week. With summer holidays upon us and host Ryan Heath moving to work for POLITICO in the United States, it's the final panel featuring the current trio. As usual, they tackle a diverse range of subjects, including a tour of the world's health care and election systems.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s EU Confidential Goes Green series is sponsored by Bayer.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "POLITICO\u2019s flagship podcast, EU Confidential, is devoting special episodes to green themes between March and September 2019.\r\n\r\nIn this occasional series, the show zooms in on the big issues around climate and sustainability with its signature mix of compelling interviews, expert journalism and lively debate.", "authors": ["Ryan Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EU-Confidential-homepage-v1-green.png"}
