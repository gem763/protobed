Maybe he'll begin to slide. Maybe he'll get beaten in Iowa and New Hampshire, and South Carolina won't turn out to be the firewall he hoped. But I'm reminded of the fall of 2015, when Trump was leading the GOP polls any my colleagues were writing columns about how Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz was really in the lead, even though that wasn't what the numbers said. It looks to me as if Biden's lead is pretty durable, and I'm guessing that many voters don't care about his \"gaffes\" -- a word from the dumbed-down language called Journalese. If and when he clearly demonstrates that he's not sharp enough anymore to do the job, I think he'll slide. The fact that he's kind of a marble-mouth (which he's always been) is not seen as disqualifying -- at this point, at least.", "description": "Eugene Robinson discussed his latest columns and political news.", "authors": ["Eugene Robinson", "Eugene Robinson Is An Associate Editor", "Twice-Weekly Columnist For The Washington Post.
