We\u2019re talking about Nollsie, baby.\n\nThis week\u2019s deep-dive into history\u2019s best viral moments takes us right back to that fateful day in 2003 when Australian Idol robbed our mate Shannon Noll of the victory he so obviously deserved.\n\nOur girl Lucinda Price sits down with Australia\u2019s favourite pub-rock king to discuss Nollsie\u2019s experience with fame, both internet and real life.\n\nBack in 2016, Nollsie was thrust back into the spotlight after a viral petition for him to headline Groovin\u2019 The Moo.
