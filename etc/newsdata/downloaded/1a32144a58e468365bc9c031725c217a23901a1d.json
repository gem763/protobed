It is an old lift that never inspires confidence that it will make it all the way up.\n\nSo I sympathised with the pope, who was stuck in a lift for 25 minutes in the Vatican last week, and had to be rescued by firefighters. Anyway, we reported that, \u201cunphased by the lift ordeal\u201d, he went on to deliver a speech in which he urged governments to find the political will to deal with climate change.\n\nThanks to Mick O\u2019Hare for pointing out that this should have been \u201cunfazed\u201d. \u201cFaze\u201d is an unusual word, so it is always likely to be spelt like the more familiar one that sounds the same. But \u201cfaze\u201d is a variant of \u201cfeeze\u201d, meaning \u201cdrive or frighten off\u201d, which became popular in the US in the 19th century, but which comes from Old English \u201cfesian\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The officer\u2019s state of unknowing is not the most important part of the story, so a simpler headline would have been something like: \u201cPolice officer refuses to help abuse victim while Macron listens in on call.\u201d\n\nKashmiri icons: Eight iconics in The Independent last week, including \u201cLal Chowk, Srinagar\u2019s large, iconic central square and shopping district\u201d in an article about Kashmir, a state in crisis. Later in the same article we came across \u201cDal Lake, and its iconic shikaras and houseboats\u201d.\n\nSometimes \u201ciconic\u201d just means \u201cfamous\u201d, which is an unnecessary word in most journalism, because if something really is famous then the reader will have heard of it, and if it isn\u2019t, saying it\u2019s famous doesn\u2019t help.\n\nAnyway, I have been to Srinagar and I don\u2019t remember the central square. I do remember the wooden boats, but I had forgotten they were called shikaras. Calling them \u201ciconic shikaras\u201d could have been an example of the other use of \u201ciconic\u201d: a way of alerting the reader to a distinctive and memorable feature.\n\nShikaras are traditional boats that feature in all the tourist photos of Kashmir, and so for some readers \u201ciconic\u201d might prompt a mental image of what we are talking about. But there must be better ways of painting the picture than saying, in effect, \u201cthink of the cliche\u201d.", "description": "I had to take the stairs to my office in parliament this week because two colleagues were stuck \u2013 briefly \u2013 in the lift, and I didn\u2019t want to take the risk.
