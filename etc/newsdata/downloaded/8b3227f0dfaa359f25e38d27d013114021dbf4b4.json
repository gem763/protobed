(AP) - Alabama officials have found an opponent they can\u2019t beat: The September heat.\n\nUniversity President Stuart R. Bell and athletic director Greg Byrne issued a joint statement Monday complaining that the Southern Miss game on Sept. 21 has been set for 11 a.m. Central. The Crimson Tide just held a sparsely attended game against New Mexico State with a mid-afternoon kickoff and temperatures of about 95 degrees.\n\nThe statement says Alabama has played more nonconference day games at home in September since 2014 than any other SEC team. Byrne and Bell say they\u2019ve \u201chad a number of conversations with\u201d Southeastern Conference officials.\n\nThe game is set to be televised on either ESPN or ESPN2.\n\nCrimson Tide coach Nick Saban said earlier Monday he hopes the administration will keep trying to get such games scheduled at different times.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alabama officials have found an opponent they can't beat: The September heat.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/new_mexico_st_alabama_football_66709_c0-83-1977-1235_s1770x1032.jpg?e4847f04d314f5b9e71470641dcd8da66b86fb51", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
