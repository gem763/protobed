Players have to solve puzzles, find clues, and use Luigi's ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner to save the day.\n\nLike the previous \"Luigi's Mansion\" games, \"Luigi's Mansion 3\" doesn't have the same sort of acrobatic platforming you'd expect from \"Super Mario.\" The game has a much slower pace as you explore every corner of the hotel, and you'll have to be ready for jump scares and ghosts lurking in the shadows.\n\nLuigi's vacuum, the Poltergust G00, can do much more than just suck things up \u2014 you'll use it to grab objects and fire them at ghosts, you can drag obstacles out of the way, and even use it to swing across gaps in the floor. While most \"Super Mario\" games have a clear path to the end, you'll need to put your thinking cap on to figure out how to complete puzzles and defeat special boss ghosts in \"Luigi's Mansion 3.\"\n\n\"Luigi's Mansion 3\" will also have multiplayer mode for up to four people to take on endless challenges online, or playing on the same Switch console.\n\nBusiness Insider's Ben Gilbert said \"Luigi's Mansion 3\" was the most impressive out of all the Nintendo-exclusives coming this year when he played the game earlier this year. After a few hours of hands-on time, I'd have to agree.\n\nHere's a closer look at \"Luigi's Mansion 3\" based on my play time thus far:", "description": "In this \"Super Mario Bros.\" spin-off, Luigi will have to rescue Mario and Peach from a haunted hotel.", "authors": ["Kevin Webb"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da7144acc4a0a2868222393?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
