He said he has no plans to return to politics, but as an author, former \u201cAir America\u201d radio host and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer and comedian, he\u2019s returning to a realm he inhabited before becoming a senator.\n\n\u201cI miss the Senate a lot but I\u2019m not there so I want to be a voice,\u201d he said in an interview. Of the public\u2019s acceptance, he said \u201ca lot of that will depend on me and whether folks think what I\u2019m saying is important and fun at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe one-hour interview show with figures from politics, entertainment and other fields will air Saturdays at 10 a.m. ET on the Sirius Progress channel, with replays available on demand. Comic Chris Rock will be the first guest, with former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and comic Patton Oswalt lined up for future shows.\n\nFranken said he\u2019s been talking for a few months with Sirius about the show, the conversations an outgrowth of a podcast he\u2019s been hosting.\n\nHe said there\u2019s a lot of public issues he wants to talk about, particularly with the 2020 election looming, mentioning health care and education specifically.\n\n\u201cWhen Harry\u2019s (Reid) on, I\u2019ll be the funny one,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Rock is on, I\u2019ll be the one who served in the Senate.\u201d\n\nFranken\u2019s support among fellow Senate Democrats crumbled quickly in 2017 after conservative radio host Leeann Tweeden and several other women accused him of unwanted kissing or touching. A photo that showed him with his hands appearing to reach for the breasts of Tweeden as she slept while returning from a USO tour - an apparent joke badly gone awry - mobilized public opinion against him.\n\nAn investigation by The New Yorker magazine published this summer called some of the charges against him into question. In the piece, seven current or former senators who had demanded his resignation now said they regretted doing so. An eighth, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said so after the article was published. But New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, widely seen as the leader of the movement to remove Franken, has expressed no such regrets.\n\n\u201cI was very gratified that eight of my colleagues have apologized and done so publicly and expressed regret for not giving me due process,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare that you get one senator admitting that he or she had done something wrong. I think the American people believe in due process as well.\u201d\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t plan further discussion on his show about what happened to him and, if anyone is interested, he\u2019ll point them in the direction of the New Yorker piece. In that article, Franken said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regretted stepping down and that he was angry at fellow senators who pressured him to leave.\n\nFranken told the AP that he didn\u2019t expect that any feeling of betrayal by colleagues will be a problem when he has to discuss issues that involve, for instance, Gillibrand or Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. He said he\u2019s had no potential guest turn him down out of skittishness about being involved in controversy.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m doing that it won\u2019t be about personalities,\u201d Franken said. \u201cIt will be about where people stand.\u201d\n\nHe said he had no comment about the fate of Gillibrand\u2019s presidential campaign, which she ended in late August.\n\nSiriusXM did not make its executives available for an interview. Megan Liberman, the company\u2019s senior vice president of news, talk and entertainment programming, said in a statement that \u201cAl Franken is an important and influential progressive voice, whom many have missed. SiriusXM is the perfect platform for him to re-enter the public conversation.\u201d\n\nThe company said that in addition to his weekly show, Franken will participate in elections coverage, including on the nights of debates, primaries and the election.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Al Franken, who resigned his U.S. Senate seat in 2017 amid sexual misconduct charges, will re-emerge into the public sphere on Saturday when he starts a new weekly radio show on the SiriusXM satellite service.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "David Bauder"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/media-franken_44105_c0-379-4592-3056_s1770x1032.jpg?875e6e91bf292e46653773ef8777df4e8445359e", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
