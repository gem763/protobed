Have we ever had a chief executive who is so skeptical of the judgments of career diplomats and military leaders, who rejects the advice of top intelligence leaders, who trusts his family more than those with a lifetime of experience?\n\nYes we have. And his name was John Fitzgerald Kennedy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nKennedy and Donald Trump are hardly similar men, nor are they similar presidents. JFK\u2019s 14 years of experience in the House and Senate, his knowledge of history and his prudence in public (as opposed to private) matters make that notion absurd. But in one way they are alike: Throughout Kennedy\u2019s presidency, he came more and more to distrust the received wisdom of the \u201cpermanent government\u201d or \u201cdeep state\u201d or \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d or whatever term seems apt today. In his case, that skepticism may have saved the planet from nuclear annihilation.\n\nDuring the tumult of the Trump years, generals like H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis have been glorified as steadying influences in the room\u2014military wisemen whose opinions on everything from Syria to NATO Trump has recklessly disregarded. And that is true. Trump deserves censure for his refusal to listen to the advice of experienced hands, and his White House can be faulted for jettisoning decades worth of scientific, economic and military expertise.\n\nBut in the reflexive rush to criticize Trump, we risk forgetting the lesson of the Kennedy years: There is danger in relying too heavily on the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the elders. A president with a well-honed resistance to the certainties of experts and a strong sense of history can be a crucial protection against disaster. Unlike Kennedy, Trump possesses only one of these traits. But we shouldn\u2019t let the current president\u2019s lapses reset our expectations for civilian control over the military and foreign affairs.\n\nJFK campaigned in 1960 as a conventional Cold Warrior, warning that the United States was falling behind the Soviet Union, arguing that a (nonexistent) \u201cmissile gap\u201d was threatening our security, embracing the idea that the fall of any nation to Communism would threaten surrounding nations\u2014the domino theory. But he had also come to office with a strong belief that the power of nationalism was changing the dynamic of world politics. He\u2019d been skeptical about France\u2019s ability to hold Indochina in the early 1950s. And in his first days in office, Kennedy rejected the advice of his military advisers to commit troops into Laos\u2014advice that included the use of tactical nuclear weapons.\n\nHis skepticism about the military grew steadily. After the Bay of Pigs fiasco in 1961, he said, \u201cThose sons of bitches with all the fruit salad just sat there, nodding, saying it would work.\u201d He was furious when it took hours for the army to deploy troops to deal with rioting at the University of Mississippi when the first black student was admitted. And in the closest brush with nuclear war ever\u2014the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014Kennedy repeatedly refused to strike at Soviet missile installations on the island.\n\nHis judgment may well have made the difference between war and peace. But the military and intelligence heavyweights saw it otherwise. \u201cThe greatest defeat in our history,\u201d Air Force Chief Curtis LeMay called it. Former Secretary of State Dean Acheson\u2014the ultimate \u201cwise man\u201d who had confidently assured JFK that the Soviets would not respond to a military strike in Cuba\u2014called the peaceful resolution of the crisis a matter of \u201cluck\u201d and later said, \u201cWe have to face the fact that the United States has no leader.\u201d And Allen Dulles, the longtime CIA chief cashiered by JFK after the Bay of Pigs, said in retirement: \u201cKennedy is weak, not a leader.\u201d\n\nKennedy, in turn, was sufficiently worried about his military advisers that he encouraged director John Frankenheimer to make a movie out of Seven Days in May, a novel about an attempted military coup, and even vacated the White House for a weekend to accommodate the movie\u2019s shooting schedule.\n\nBy June 1963, Kennedy was signaling his intention to break with the Cold War consensus. In a speech at American University, he called for a new approach toward the Soviet Union. While condemning their totalitarian system, he said: \u201cLet us not be blind to our differences, but let us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which those differences can be resolved. And if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity. For, in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d\n\nKennedy sought to lessen criticism of his proposed new approach to Moscow with huge increases in the defense budget. And he bears substantial responsibility for sending 15,000 \u201ccombat advisers\u201d into Vietnam. But history suggests that he was looking for ways out of that quagmire, while dealing with the harsh domestic political realities. He told a friend: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our asses out. \u2026 But I can\u2019t give up a piece of territory to the Communists and then get the people to re-elect me.\u201d\n\nKennedy pushed back against the \u201cpermanent government\u201d by relying on different eyes and ears for advice and information. Most obvious was his turn to his brother, Robert Kennedy, as a key adviser on any and all matters, beyond RFK\u2019s job as attorney general. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK used ABC correspondent John Scali as a go-between with Alexandr S. Fomin, a KGB official in Washington and a personal friend of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. When Kennedy learned that French journalist Jean Daniel was going to interview Fidel Castro, he met with Daniel and asked that they meet again on his return. He encouraged Deputy U.N. Ambassador (and former journalist) William Atwood to maintain contacts with members of the Cuban delegation.\n\nNo one can know, of course, whether JFK would have moved further from the Cold War consensus in a second term. What we do know is that throughout his presidency, he was one of the few voices pushing back against the assumptions of those around him. Virtually every \u201cwise man\u201d\u2014McGeorge Bundy, Walt Rostow, Dean Rusk, the joint chiefs\u2014argued for escalation in Vietnam, but Kennedy pushed back. He would say, for example, if you can convince Douglas MacArthur that a land war in Asia is a good idea, let me know. And after his death, his successor\u2014far less grounded in history or foreign policy, and without Kennedy\u2019s deep doubts about the wisdom of the military, presided over the full-scale tragedy that was Vietnam.\n\nThe wrong lesson, then, is that it is acceptable for a president like Trump to carry out an ignorant, narcissistic foreign policy. But it is equally wrong to think that presidents should mindlessly defer to their military and diplomatic advisers. It was \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d who led us into Vietnam; it was the counsel of seasoned, experienced leaders who led us into Iraq in 2003; it was a team of well-versed experts who presided over the descent into the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nUnder Trump, we have seen that a president without the gifts of knowledge and judgment is ill-served by ignoring advice from the grownups in the room. By relying on his own instincts in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president greatly strengthened the hands of Iran, Russia and ISIS while shaking our allies\u2019 faith in America\u2019s judgment.\n\nThe heavy costs of ignoring sound advice may lead the next president to reaffirm respect for the \u201cdeep state.\u201d But if respect becomes veneration, if the next president does not know how and where to look for alternatives to the consensus, that could well lead to a new series of destructive policies. A president without the ability to thoughtfully contest the conventional wisdom, without the ability to argue for new alternatives to old problems, does the office and the nation no favor.", "description": "In the rush to criticize the current president, we risk forgetting the lesson of the Kennedy years: There is danger in relying too heavily on the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the elders.", "authors": ["Jeff Greenfield"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/95/9ab709ca4d60ac6ce65a74aff534/191029-jfk-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
