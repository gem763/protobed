Now they\u2019re not so sure.\n\nEconomists broadly expect the ECB on Thursday to reduce its key deposit rate by at least 10 basis points, or a 10th of a percentage point, from the current level of minus 0.4%. But expectations for the size of the monthly bond-purchase program that might also be announced have been eroding, a move that has helped keep once free-falling bond yields in place this month.\n\nThe recent volatility reflects shifting views on the appetite for a sizable stimulus package among ECB officials, as President Mario Draghi prepares to hand off the reins on Nov. 1\u2014and, according to some portfolio managers, an overdue reckoning with the market\u2019s earlier wishful thinking.\n\nMario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is stepping down on Nov. 1.

Like many investors around the globe, he believes sluggish Western economies are unlikely to recover their former vigor without an aggressive government-spending plan that could over time significantly boost employment, wages and demand for goods and services.\n\n\u201cWe doubt how effective monetary policy is, without fiscal expansion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe yield on 10-year German government bonds, which had dropped to as low as a record minus 0.742% on Sept. 3, recovered to minus 0.538% on Wednesday. That is still significantly lower than the yield of minus 0.405% on July 25, when the monetary authority said it was \u201cdetermined to act\u201d to bolster inflation. Yields fall when bond prices rise.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you expect a stimulus package from the ECB to play out globally? Join the conversation below.\n\nIn anticipation of the stimulus package including the asset purchase plan, commonly known as quantitative easing, European companies are already selling bonds. In the two weeks from Aug. 26, about $33.58 billion of investment-grade debt was issued by companies in the region, according to Dealogic data, up from $9.63 billion in the previous two-week period.\n\nStimulus Response What to watch for as the ECB prepares to meet in the shadow of slowing growth and low inflation. Interest rate cut Expected. Current deposit rate has been -0.4% since March 2016. Cushioning measures for banks Expected. Exemptions to the deposit rate cut, often known as tiering, may help banks to keep lending. Restarting quantitative easing Likely. The previous round of bond purchases ended in December. Changing the composition of bond buys Possible. The ECB may give itself more room to buy bonds by placing more emphasis on securities issued by companies. Forward guidance changes Expected. The ECB is likely to amplify the impact of its stimulus measures by promising to keep them in place for a specified period of time, or until certain conditions have been met.\n\nBut in recent days, some investors have started questioning if Mr. Draghi will hold off this week on offering specific details about the quantitative-easing program, while others have speculated that the ECB could surprise the market by opting to include bank credit, equities and exchange-traded funds in that plan. There is also an expectation that the ECB is likely to take steps to make negative rates less painful for banks.\n\nAs hopes of the fresh asset-purchase program mounted, investors piled into Italian and Spanish government bonds, which offer positive yields. The yield on 10-year Italian debt dropped to 0.801% on Sept. 4, from 1.526% when the monetary authority last met, while the yield on equivalent Spanish debt fell to 0.031% on Aug. 16 from 0.365%. Still, both yields have rallied slightly in recent days as the market pared back its expectations.\n\nThe market is also closely watching for stronger links between the forward guidance and inflation. The ECB\u2019s decisions could have significant implications for the eurozone\u2019s troubled economy, which has been racked by uncertainty over Brexit, global trade tensions and China\u2019s slowdown, a likely recession in Germany and political turbulence in Italy.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts at BNP Paribas Asset Management continue to expect the ECB to deliver a 15 basis point-cut to the benchmark rate and purchase \u20ac300-400 billion of bonds over a year. That forecast was considered too low a few weeks ago, Mr. Harte said, but now appears to be in line with the market\u2019s consensus.\n\nHe has pared back his own position on European bonds and equities to slightly underweight in recent weeks, from overweight, on the expectation that markets might be headed for a disappointment.\n\nDavid Zahn, head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton, fears the ECB\u2019s decision-making committee will struggle to agree on a package of stimulus measures\u2014and the need for a new bond-buying program, in particular\u2014as they gear up for Mr. Draghi\u2019s likely successor, Christine Lagarde, to take over.\n\nMs. Lagarde, whose appointment is pending formal approval from European Union leaders, has pledged to review the costs and benefits of controversial ECB policy tools such as negative interest rates and large-scale bond purchases.\n\n\u201cThey might be more open to expressing disagreement,\u201d Mr. Zahn said. He plans to buy up long-dated bonds and Germany government debt, in particular, if the market sells off on Thursday.\n\nThere is also concern that further rate cuts and quantitative easing might do little to boost growth and inflation, according to Moritz Sterzinger, a director at financial-advisory firm JCRA. Monetary easing amounts to \u201cpushing on a string,\u201d he says, but disappointment on Thursday could roil markets.\n\n\u201cIf the message is not quite as dovish as the market makes it out to be, I would expect there to be quite a big countermove again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014Paul J.
