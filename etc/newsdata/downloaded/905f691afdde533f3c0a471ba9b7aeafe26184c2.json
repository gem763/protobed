It's difficult, given its dominance since last autumn at the top of our best buy savings tables.\n\nBefore the Goldman Sachs-backed bank unleashed its easy-access account in September, rates were at historic lows and not a single 'bread and butter' account paid 1.5 per cent.\n\nNow, following the launch of Nottingham Building Society's rebranded online savings arm Beehive, there are four to choose from.\n\nIt used to be the case not so long ago that no easy access accounts offered 1.5% interest. Now there are several\n\nAs well as Beehive and Marcus, you can grab the rate from Cynergy Bank and Virgin Money's Double Take E-Saver.\n\nCynergy pays 1.5 per cent for the first 12 months before it drops to one per cent, while Marcus includes a year-long 0.15 per cent bonus rate, meaning the rate will drop to 1.35 per cent after 12 months.\n\nBoth Virgin's and Beehive's offers stick around with no bonus \u2013 though you can only make two withdrawals from Virgin a year.\n\nAll of these are worthy short-term options for your cash if you are languishing on a poor rate elsewhere. They also offer FSCS protection.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, Leeds Building Society this week launched an account with a 10 year fixed-rate, paying 2.5 per cent.\n\nLeeds says there's been demand from its customers for a long-term account that pays a guaranteed rate, but it can be topped by several accounts that lock your cash away for half the time.\n\nExperts aren't convinced \u2013 with one saying Atom Bank's two year fixed-rate paying 2.23 per cent is a far better option.\n\nLeeds' offer is also only half a percentage point better than the top rate you can get on a one-year fix, with 2 per cent being offered by both Gatehouse and Metro Bank.\n\nIf you're in the market for a tax-free account, updated this week is This is Money's latest round up of the best cash Isa deals.\n\nCoventry Building Society's easy-access joins those four accounts mentioned at the top as it pays 1.5 per cent, but that rate drops by 0.35 per cent after 15 months.\n\nFixed-rate Isas haven't quite reached parity with their non-tax-wrapped peers in the same way as the easy access accounts.\n\nCoventry also offers a top-rate five-year fix of 2.1 per cent. If that's too long a term, Virgin will pay you 1.82 per cent on a two-year fixed rate, but bear in mind that account is online only.\n\nFor more inspiration, look at our independent best buy tables \u2013 and bookmark them, as they are updated throughout the week.", "description": "Remember the time before Marcus Bank?
