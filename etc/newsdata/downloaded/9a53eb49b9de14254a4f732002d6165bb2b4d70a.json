And of those animal owners, only 6 percent own a rat or mouse \u2014 well behind guinea pigs (27 percent), rabbits (27 percent) and hamsters (25 percent), but ahead of gerbils (4 percent) and hermit crabs (2 percent).\n\nMost pet rodents \u2014 such as gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs \u2014 tend to bite, said veterinarian Cory Bassett, who specializes in exotic pet care in Overland Park, Kan. They are more antisocial and skittish because they are bred for quantity, not personality, she said.\n\nBut rats specifically bred to be pets, she said, are calm \u2014 and do not tend to bite the hand that feeds them, she said, and seem to bond emotionally with cage mates and owners.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Health Theyre-Intelligent-And-Friendly-Why-Some-People-Think-Rats-Are-The-Perfect-Pet-For-Fun-And-Comfort"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
