A series of clashes two weeks ago between protesters and security forces left 157 people dead and over 6,000 wounded.\n\nThe unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which lived through foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State (IS) insurgency between 2003 and 2017. It is the biggest challenge to security since IS was declared beaten.\n\nOn Friday, eight protesters were killed in Baghdad, the Iraqi Human Rights Commission said. At least five of them were protesters struck by tear gas canisters, security sources said.\n\nIn the south, at least six protesters were killed when members of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq (AAH) militia opened fire on protesters who tried to set fire to the group's office in the city of Nasiriya, according to security sources.\n\nEight people were killed in Amara city, including six protesters, one AAH member and one intelligence officer, police sources said. Three protesters were killed in oil-rich Basra and one in Samawa, security sources said.\n\nInterior Ministry spokesman Khalid al-Muhanna said at least 68 members of the security forces were injured.\n\nThe sometimes violent demonstrations erupted in Baghdad on Oct. 1 and spread to southern cities.\n\nThey pose the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters' discontent.\n\nDespite the OPEC member country's vast oil wealth, many Iraqis live in poverty, have limited access to clean water, electricity, basic healthcare or decent education as the country tries to recover from years of conflict and economic hardship.\n\nIn a Thursday night address, Abdul Mahdi stressed that violence would not be tolerated and warned that any collapse of the government would drag Iraq into further turmoil.", "description": "At least 25 protesters were killed in Iraq when security forces used tear gas and an Iranian-backed militia opened fire at demonstrations.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/98/82/1000x563_cmsv2_fbe0f15d-068b-5097-bdf8-e4c4f8381f99-4259882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
