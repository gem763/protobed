And, then they thought, 'Oh, you're a veteran so you're packing?' None of this s--t is funny.\"\n\nThe woman also said Matthews' father said she was lying before he was shown video of the incident.\n\nKevin McGran of The Star reported the incident happened in Scottsdale, Arizona, and a complaint was filed on May 28. Matthews is facing disorderly conduct charges and also allegedly dropped his pants after he and his friends attempted to get into the security guard's car.\n\nAccording to McGran, the woman said Matthews kept his underwear up while dropping his pants. The police report said a security video showed a man walking with his underwear up but pants around his ankles.\n\n\"The Toronto Maple Leafs are aware of the complaint of disturbing the peace against forward Auston Matthews,\" the team said in a statement, per McGran. \"Auston is cooperating fully with the relevant authorities but neither he nor the Club will comment any further out of respect for the process involved.\"\n\nLuke Fox of Sportsnet reported the Maple Leafs were unaware of the allegations until they were made public.", "description": "Police video of the woman who said  Toronto Maple Leafs  center  Auston Matthews  and his friends attempted to get into her car on May 26  was leaked Wednesday ...", "authors": ["Scott Polacek"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/002/hi-res-f5896ba9776ea7f0971554d18bc214c7_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
