It was a mix of loving the country, loving the people, loving what I do and having good opportunities to develop my career.\"\n\nWATCH: What it takes to open a hotel according to a seasoned GM\n\n(Photo: Gabi Zietsman)\n\nHaving also worked in the European industry before coming here, Jelenovic believes that while people generally enter the workforce there already trained up and skilled, in South Africa there's a lot more room for people with less educational opportunities to grow themselves.\n\nTourism is the third-largest socio-economic activity in Europe and normally the first job for the youth workforce, however they do face a skills shortage according to White Paper on the industry's sustainability.\n\n\"In Europe, people often come with substantial training into the industry, the start seems easier and well-prepared, but here people develop through sheer passion and drive and a willingness to achieve that.\"\n\nREAD: From waitress to executive housekeeper at the Radisson: How this super-mom of five didn't give up\n\nWhat makes our hospitality so unique?\n\n\"I think the diversity of the people, the opportunity to develop people, especially entry-level people - people who normally don't have the opportunity to enter the workforce educated or already trained.\"\n\n\"Some people look at it as a challenge, I look at it as an opportunity. It's amazing to see somebody start as an untrained waiter, for example, and in a couple of years develop into a supervisory role and moving onward. It is far more rewarding to see it here than in the rest of the world, like Europe for example.\"\n\nDuring the budget speeches earlier in the year, President Cyril Ramaphosa cited the tourism industry as a priory sector, aiming to double its contribution to South Africa' economy. In 2018, 1.5 million people were employed across the value chain, and budget has been set aside to improve service excellence.\n\nEven this year's World Tourism Day in September had the theme of 'Tourism and jobs', when Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane noted that South Africans should \"drive their own economic development.\"\n\nALSO READ: When you manage a hotel that is a train on a bridge in Kruger, dreaming up crazy ideas are the norm\n\nWhat does it take to become the general manager of a hotel?\n\n\"My philosophy on hospitality is to be passionate about providing service, looking after people,\" says Jelenovic, \"but you know as you progress through your career it also becomes about looking after your people, the teams, developing people and ensuring the business is financially successful.\"\n\n\"With hard work, lots of passion and drive, it is possible. People often think that you have to have some special skills, but you develop that throughout the years. You polish your leadership skills and your understanding of the business - it sounds like a cliche but the sky really is the limit.\"\n\n\"I came with two suitcases to this country and I started as a receptionist and as the years pass by you expand your dream and eventually - you get there.\"\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
