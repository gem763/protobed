Kasun Rajitha could be called back into the XI in place of Nuwan Pradeep who had an average outing in the last match. Other than this, it would be a cruel decision if they drop any other player from the XI.\n\nThe pitch in Karachi was good for batting in the previous match and what Pakistan ended up scoring shows the true nature of the wicket. It is likely to hold its trueness for even the final match. Spinners could come handy in the day time.", "description": "Viewers in India can watch the Pak v SL 3rd ODI on Sony Six channel with streaming available on Sonyliv.com.
