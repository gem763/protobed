His hope was to win back the Tory majority his predecessor Theresa May lost in 2017, which would allow him to push for a new deal in Brussels or settle for no-deal with authority.\n\nEither way, his core promise of leaving on October 31 \u2014 made on Johnson\u2019s first day in office and repeated ad nauseam ever since \u2014 would be kept, and the Conservatives would be able to preside over post-Brexit Britain until the next election in mid-2020s.\n\n\u201cCorbyn being persuaded not to go for an election was a significant moment\" \u2014 A senior government official\n\nIt almost worked. MPs duly voted to block a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson in turn, with great shows of reluctance, said an election was now the only option. But then something happened that was not in the script.\n\nThe plan was predicated, say those familiar with thinking in No. 10, on the idea that the opposition Labour Party would not duck a pre-Brexit election in mid-October.\n\nBut then, on September 4, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn did just that, denying the prime minister the two-thirds parliamentary majority required for an election to take place under U.K. law. The move forced Johnson to shift to Plan B: a desperate scrabble for a deal with the EU before October 19 to avoid being forced to break his promise by asking Brussels for a Brexit delay, as mandated by the new law.\n\nThat Labour would not vote for an election was, according to several senior officials and ministers who spoke to POLITICO on condition of anonymity, the defining strategic miscalculation of Johnson\u2019s tenure \u2014 and its knock-on effects have been far-reaching.\n\n\u201cThe major miscalculation was that opposition parties who have called for an election repeatedly would vote for one when given the opportunity,\u201d said a senior minister. \u201cThey didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYet again on Wednesday, the prime minister was thwarted in an effort to secure an election, as Labour and other opposition parties continued to demand that the Brexit extension comes into force first \u2013 leaving the prime minister with increasingly few good options if he wants to deliver on his promise, and stay in office.\n\nKnives out for Cummings\n\nTuesday\u2019s dramatic U.K. Supreme Court ruling that Johnson broke the law when he advised the queen to suspend parliament for five weeks \u2014 and the resulting recall of the House of Commons \u2014 has deepened the gloom in Downing Street and led to further questions about one of the key architects of Johnson\u2019s strategy, Dominic Cummings.\n\nOne senior minister said Cummings, a senior Johnson adviser, had been central to the plan to suspend parliament \u2014 and in the decision to sack 21 Conservative MPs who defied Johnson with votes to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe minister said they had noted that Johnson\u2019s other senior adviser, Eddie Lister, had in recent days and weeks appeared to be taking a bigger role in Johnson\u2019s decision-making. Lister, a former London council leader who served as chief of staff to Johnson during his tenure as London mayor, accompanied Johnson during his trip to Biarritz, France for the G7 summit and to the United Nations in New York. He has also been ensuring Downing Street maintains good ties with U.K. businesses, who are deeply worried about the prospect of a hard Brexit.\n\n\u201cLister is a grown- up. He has been elected,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThere is something about people who have been elected by people and people who have never had to do it, and that is the key difference between [Cummings and Lister],\u201d said the minister, who is critical of Cummings\u2019 confrontational style.\n\nWhich of the two is more senior has never been made explicit by Downing Street, something reflected in confusion about their titles. Lister was initially reported to be \u201cchief of staff\u201d but this was then contradicted. One official said that Cummings\u2019 name badge for a recent event had called him \u201csenior assistant to the prime minister.\u201d\n\nWhat is clear is that while Lister takes the lead on external relations, Cummings is the key figure powering the government\u2019s drive for no-deal, which has seen no let-up. He runs daily meetings of a Cabinet committee called exit operations (XO), where a planning matrix known as \u201cthe dashboard\u201d displays priority projects for preparing the U.K. for a hard Brexit.\n\nWhile Downing Street has cultivated an image of Cummings as somehow omniscient, the botched plan for a mid-October election has led to increasing questions about his strategy.\n\n\u201cCorbyn being persuaded not to go for an election was a significant moment,\u201d said a senior government official. Did Cummings \u2014 the arch-strategist, a devotee of game theory, the political stratagems of Otto von Bismarck and computer chess \u2014 not see it coming? \u201cYou never know with Dom,\u201d the official said.\n\n\"Leaving on October 31, deal or no deal, is something we\u2019ll never change our strategy on\" \u2014 UK government official\n\nAnother official played down the importance of the misjudging Labour, insisting that the government has always been acutely aware of the need to adapt their strategy to unpredictable events.\n\n\u201cMost corners you turn there\u2019s the risk of being boxed in and you have to be light on your feet and change direction if required. But there are fundamentals that won\u2019t change. Leaving on October 31, deal or no deal, is something we\u2019ll never change our strategy on,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe prime minister, a U.K. government official said, still has full confidence in Cummings.\n\nWhat now?\n\nAn election could still come about if and when opposition parties decide to hold a vote of no confidence in the government, something Corbyn reiterated on Wednesday he would only do after a Brexit extension \u2014 until January 2020 \u2014 has been secured.\n\nOn Wednesday, as MPs returned to parliament following the Supreme Court ruling, there were suggestions from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox that the government might push again for an early election. But Labour remains deeply suspicious that Johnson will seek to wriggle out of the law \u2014 the Benn Act \u2014 that requires him to request a Brexit extension. The party will not back an election until it is convinced that the Brexit delay is locked in and legally watertight, a party official said. That could require the prime minister to ask for an extension, and have it granted by the EU, before Labour agrees to an election.\n\nThe crucial point is that it\u2019s the opposition, not the government, that feels it has the whip hand over the timing of an election.\n\nSenior government officials now speak gloomily about the prospect of a Brexit delay being forced on them next month, and then being dragged into an election after all \u2014 but one in which Johnson\u2019s October 31 pledge has been broken.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great position to be in, I think we\u2019ll just be painted as another Theresa May,\u201d one senior Conservative aide said.\n\n\u201cIf we do not see Brexit by October 31, a lot of colleagues will be very concerned about going to the country because of the looming presence of the Brexit Party\" \u2014 Tory MP\n\nConservative MPs fear the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage would, in this scenario, cry Brexit betrayal and devastate the Tory vote, just as they did in the spring\u2019s European election, when May\u2019s Conservatives fell to fifth place. This could potentially allow the pro-second referendum Labour Party and the pro-Remain Liberal Democrats to steal a march on the Tories and keep them out of power.\n\n\u201cIf we do not see Brexit by October 31, a lot of colleagues will be very concerned about going to the country because of the looming presence of the Brexit Party,\u201d said one MP and former Cabinet minister. \u201cThere is concern that we will be seen to have failed and that the only way to deliver Brexit will be to switch to the Brexit Party, which will mean the loss of a lot of Conservative seats.\u201d\n\nIf Johnson can\u2019t get a deal with the EU by October 19 \u2014 and he has made only modest progress in talks \u2014 he could face a choice between this unenviable scenario, or a radical alternative: resign rather than enact the law \u2014 passed by MPs earlier this month \u2014 that demands he delay Brexit.\n\nGovernment officials now privately say this a genuine possibility, even as Downing Street publicly rules it out.\n\nAfter his chastening defeat in the Supreme Court, Johnson may think twice about trying to defy the law a second time by simply refusing to abide by the Benn Act, said Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform think tank.\n\n\u201cSome people seem to think he\u2019d rather not [sign the letter to the EU requesting an extension] and that he won\u2019t break the law, he\u2019ll just resign. If he resigns then he will let somebody else do it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe logic of such a move would be to make way for a caretaker government that would request the Brexit delay and then call an election (Corbyn has stated his willingness to do exactly this.) Johnson, having maintained his Brexit purity, could then lead the Tories into that election having, to some extent, blunted the impact of the Brexit Party on the Conservative vote.\n\n\u201cThe risk of that for Boris is a kind of Salvini situation,\u201d Grant said, referring to the Italian League party leader who pulled the plug on his country\u2019s coalition government last month in the hope of winning a majority in a subsequent election, but instead found himself frozen out of power.\n\n\u201c[Johnson could] resign thinking there will be an election in a few weeks\u2019 time and you can get back in by winning the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then maybe the caretaker government goes on being a caretaker government for a very long time and you\u2019re excluded from power and there isn\u2019t any election.\u201d\n\nIf that scenario came to pass, it would represent the final ruin of the Downing Street strategy. For now, Johnson is still in the game \u2014 but he has learned that one simple miscalculation can bring you very close to check-mate.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
