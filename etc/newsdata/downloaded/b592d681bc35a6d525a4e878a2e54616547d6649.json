While it\u2019s not clear what specifically prompted the change, it\u2019s hard to miss the fact that $4.99 is also the price of a monthlong Tier 1 subscription on Twitch.\n\nMixer\u2019s subscriptions are a little like their analogs over at Twitch: after you buy a subscription to a channel, you get custom emotes from the broadcaster to use in chat, and a badge by your name that alerts people to your subscriber status. That said, it\u2019s not clear what cut the broadcasters receive of subscription revenue, and it\u2019s also not clear whether the price drop will impact how much Mixer\u2019s partners make. (Microsoft didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. On Twitch, broadcasters get half of whatever revenue subscriptions generate.)\n\nTwitch has four tiers of subscriptions \u2014 you can subscribe to one channel a month for free with Twitch Prime; then there\u2019s Tier 1 through 3 subscriptions, which rise in price and unlock separate emotes if the broadcaster has uploaded them. (The one exception are subscriptions purchased on iOS devices; they cost more because Apple takes a cut.)\n\nGood news everyone!\n\n\n\nStarting today all subscriptions will now be changing from $5.99 to $4.99 going forward when subscribing to any of your favorite Partners! pic.twitter.com/bFVLF4YSdU \u2014 Mixer (@WatchMixer) October 30, 2019\n\nMixer subscriptions differ from the ones on Twitch, however, because there\u2019s only one single price to subscribe and because viewers can only subscribe to Mixer partners \u2014 its set of verified users. Twitch has two tiers of broadcasters: affiliates and partners, and audiences can subscribe to either kind of channel. The difference in status is a checkmark and viewer numbers; among other things, Twitch broadcasters need to average 75 concurrent viewers a stream to be considered for partnership.\n\nWhile today\u2019s announcement isn\u2019t a huge deal on its own, it does show that Mixer is serious about competing with Twitch beyond poaching its top talent.", "description": "Mixer announced that it\u2019s dropping the price of its subscription from $5.99 a month to $4.99.
