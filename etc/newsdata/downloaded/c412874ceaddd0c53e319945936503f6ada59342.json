The hard left is demanding more public spending and has accused Costa of veering to the right. Costa has already ruled out a formal coalition government but may try to renew his pact with one of the parties, or both.\n\nThe main opposition Social Democrats, polling at under 30% now, are expected to lose seats.\n\nCosta's minority government has received praise from Brussels and at home for combining fiscal discipline with measures to promote growth after recession and the austerity of Portugal's 2010-14 debt crisis.\n\nPortugal is expected to record its lowest budget deficit in 45 years of democratic history this year. The economy is on course to grow 1.9% this year, above the EU average, helped by export growth and a booming tourism industry.\n\nBut a series of scandals, from a nepotism row to the alleged involvement of a former minister in an army cover-up of the theft of weapons from a military base, have hit the Socialists' ratings.\n\nDuring Costa's last pre-election rally in Lisbon on Friday, shop owners shouted from the sidelines: \"Shame on you!\"\n\nSince the last vote, the People-Animals-Nature party (PAN) has emerged as a potential new king-maker in parliament. PAN has said it is ready to support Costa if he commits to its environmentalist proposals, but it remains to be seen whether the party wins enough new seats.\n\n\"There is a risk things will get very divided ... I have some fear,\" said 46-year-old Leticia Goncalves, who works in a Lisbon gallery.\n\nGoncalves said the Socialists' policies made her upbeat about the country's future but she was worried that the party will not win a working majority.\n\nVoting begins at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) and closes at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT).\n\n(Additional reporting by Miguel Pereira, Editing by Andrei Khalip and James Drummond)", "description": "Portugal's centre-left Socialists are expected to retain power and win more parliament seats in general elections on Sunday, after four years of economic growth, but still fall short of an outright majority.
