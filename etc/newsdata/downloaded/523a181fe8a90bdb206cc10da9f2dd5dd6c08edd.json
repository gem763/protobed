And Luay Zreikat, of the Palestinian Authority Police, told CBC News that Ihab Ghrayeb has no Canadian connections. Rather, said Zreikat, his connections are to Greece.\n\nIsraa Ghrayeb died August 22 following a series of attacks by family members \u2014 who reportedly were enraged by a video she had posted on Instagram showing her meeting with her fianc\u00e9 prior to their marriage.\n\nIsraa Ghrayeb has become a new symbol for Arab feminists. Both her face and her story have proliferated on Arab social media accounts and have been referenced in the West by people like U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.\n\nPalestinian authorities, initially slow to get involved in the case, finally arrested and interrogated some Ghrayeb family members and said the results of their investigation will be released on September 24.\n\nIt's not clear whether Ihab Ghrayeb, described in numerous reports as having returned to his home village of Beit Sahour in the occupied West Bank to attack his sister, has been detained.\n\nSpeaking officially for the department, Guillaume Berube told CBC News that Global Affairs Canada is \"monitoring this case.\"\n\n\"Gender-based violence is abhorrent and something that our government is working domestically and internationally to end once and for all,\" he said.\n\nAnother federal government official, speaking anonymously, told CBC News that Global Affairs has asked its offices in Ramallah and Tel Aviv to look into the case and the whereabouts of Ihab Ghrayeb.\n\nAnd Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) is conducting a passport check to see if Ghrayeb entered the country recently. The department reports it hasn't turned anything up so far.\n\nStill, both social media and mainstream media in the Middle East continue to report the alleged Canadian connection.\n\nSocial media pressure campaign\n\nFor more than a week, Arab social media networks have been deluged with calls for Canada to arrest Ihab Ghrayeb, or for Ottawa to provide information on his whereabouts.\n\nSome messages have urged those who might know where Ihab Ghrayeb is in Canada right now to contact IRCC's fraud tipline. Other messages were sent directly to IRCC's Twitter account:\n\nMany called on Canada to do the right thing, or expressed a belief that Canada \u2014 unlike Arab countries \u2014 will deliver harsh punishment.\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D9%83%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7_%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1_%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#\u0643\u0644\u0646\u0627_\u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0621_\u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/israaghrayeb?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#israaghrayeb</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/canada?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#canada</a> <br>Canada we're giving you this case to handle, please don't disappoint us like arabs did and take the RIGHT decision against her brothers, father and cousin. this is not something to be forgotten through the days or even years. please canada \u2014@israaghraieb\n\nCanada has dealt with so-called honour killings on Canadian soil before \u2014 the most infamous cases being those involving the deaths of the Shafia sisters and Aqsa Parvez.\n\nBrutal and sustained attack\n\nIsraa Ghrayeb, a 21-year-old makeup artist, allegedly was first attacked by her father and brothers at her home in Beit Sahour, just outside of Bethlehem.\n\nAttempting to escape the attack, she reportedly either jumped or fell from a window, injuring her spine in the fall. She was taken to hospital.\n\nAccording to news reports from the region, her family came to the hospital and ordered nursing staff out of the room. Israa Ghrayeb's screams and pleas for help can be heard in a video shot by a Palestinian nurse from just outside the room.\n\nFor reasons that are not clear, the hospital released Ghrayeb into her family's custody. They took her home, where she died a few days later.\n\nHer family told authorities she died of a heart attack and claimed that she had been possessed by a \"djinn\" or demon. The apparent beating recorded in the hospital, said the family, was an attempt to exorcise the demon. The family also produced an imam who claimed he had completed the exorcism at the family home and removed the demon from her body by reading from the Qur'an.\n\nProtests force a response\n\nThe phenomenon of a woman being murdered by male family members for a supposed slight against the family's honour is hardly a new one in the Palestinian occupied territories \u2014 but public tolerance of so-called \"honour killings\" has diminished sharply in recent times.\n\nThe murder of Israa Ghrayeb, and the circulation of the video of the assault she suffered in the hospital, touched off a wave of anger and revulsion in the West Bank that has forced the Palestinian authorities to react.\n\n\"The case of Isra'a Ghrayeb shocked our conscience, just like those before her. These are women and girls who dream to live in safety in a society free from violence and injustice,\" the General Union of Palestinian Women and Feminist Institutions said in a statement.\n\nA Palestinian woman chants slogans during a rally in front of the prime minister's office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Monday, Sept. 2. 2019. Hundreds of Palestinian women have protested to demand an investigation into the death of Israa Ghrayeb, a 21-year-old woman whom many suspect was the victim of a so-called honour killing. (The Associated Press)\n\nAs the clamour for punishment grew in the first week of September, so did the rumours that one of the main perpetrators had come from Canada to carry out the killing, returning to Canada afterwards.\n\nThe Canadian connection was repeated by major newspapers and broadcasters across the Middle East. The Israeli news channel i24 reported that the alleged killer attends university in Canada. Jordan's Al Bawaba declared him \"a Canadian resident.\" In the Emirates, the Gulf News described Ihab Ghrayeb as \"a Canadian citizen.\"\n\nFrom there, the Canadian connection travelled to the pages of publications as diverse as The Independent in London and The Standard in Nairobi.", "description": "Canadian officials are scrambling to figure out why mainstream media and social media in the Middle East are claiming that Ihab Ghrayeb, accused of the \"honour killing\" of his sister Israa, is a Canadian citizen or resident who travelled from Canada to commit the murder and returned to Canada afterwards.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Evan Dyer Has Been A Journalist With Cbc For Years", "After An Early Career As A Freelancer In Argentina.
