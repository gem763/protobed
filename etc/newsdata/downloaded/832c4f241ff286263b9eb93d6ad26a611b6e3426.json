I have to defend myself. I only released parts of the letter because other parts were so painful. The letter didn\u2019t seem loving to me. I found it hurtful.\n\n\u201cThere was no loving message in there, nothing asking about my health, nothing from her saying, \u2018Let\u2019s get together and heal our differences\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex (Chris Jackson/PA)\n\nPeople magazine quoted an anonymous friend of Meghan, claiming that the duchess felt her father did not understand her desire for privacy after he suggested they should pose together for a press photo.\n\nMr Markle said: \u201cI don\u2019t want a picture for any other reason than if we show harmony then the press will back off.\n\n\u201cWhen I opened the letter I was hoping it was the olive branch I\u2019d longed for. I was expecting something that would be a pathway to reconciliation. Instead it was deeply hurtful.\n\n\u201cI was so devastated I couldn\u2019t show it to anyone \u2013 and never would have, had it not been for the People magazine piece which meant I had to release portions to defend myself.\u201d\n\nThis week, Meghan began legal proceedings against the newspaper, claiming it had breached copyright, infringed her privacy and breached the Data Protection Act by publishing the note.\n\nThe claim also alleges the paper edited the letter by \u201cstrategically omitting select paragraphs, specific sentences, and even singular words to mask the lies they had perpetuated for over a year\u201d.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex recently accused the tabloid press of a \u201cruthless campaign\u201d against his wife, adding: \u201cI lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThough this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one.\n\n\u201cBecause my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person.\u201d\n\nHarry said about his wife: \u201cI have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long. To stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u201d\n\nThe Mail on Sunday said it intends to defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d if the case ends up in court and denies changing the meaning of the document.\n\nFour days after Meghan\u2019s legal proceedings became public, it was claimed that the Duke of Sussex is reportedly expected to claim that journalists from the Sun and Daily Mirror newspapers hacked messages he left on his mother\u2019s phone as a child.\n\nProceedings initiated by Harry at the High Court on Friday in relation to the illegal interception of voicemail messages are now said to include allegations reporters and private investigators accessed Diana, Princess of Wales\u2019 voicemails.\n\nThe group claim, first reported by the website Byline, is believed to involve historic allegations of phone hacking where journalists and private investigators are said to have intercepted messages Harry left on Diana\u2019s phone as a child.\n\nIt is also thought that in court documents journalists are alleged to have hired private investigators to access the late princess\u2019 phone both before and after her death in August 1997.\n\nClaims have also reportedly been made that staff at The Sun deleted emails and removed potential evidence when public concerns about phone hacking were first raised.", "description": "The retired lighting director said he was `devastated\u00b4 when it was first mentioned publicly in the American magazine.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/22/wire-19344402-1570312712-280_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
