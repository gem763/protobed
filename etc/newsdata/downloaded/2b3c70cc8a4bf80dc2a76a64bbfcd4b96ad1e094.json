But there\u2019s a monster disease among us today\u2014and it continues to grow in strength, affecting an estimated 30 million Americans. You can\u2019t do much about extreme weather, but you can protect yourself against type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhy have a National Diabetes Month?\n\nType 2 diabetes affects more than 30 million people in this country. Another 8 million are thought to have it but aren\u2019t diagnosed.\n\nFrom a 2017 study, looking ahead to 2030:\n\n\u201cThe prevalence of diabetes\u2026will increase by 54 percent to more than 54.9 million Americans\u2026\n\nAnnual deaths attributed to diabetes will climb by 38 percent to 385,800\u2026\n\nTotal annual diabetes medical and societal costs will increase 53 percent to more than $622 billion by 2030.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why this is National Diabetes Month\u2014to continue raising awareness, educating the public, and encouraging and empowering people to take control of this disease before it\u2019s too late.\n\nBut wait. If we\u2019re smarter about sugar, diet and exercise than in decades past, what\u2019s fueling this rampaging epidemic?\n\nRecent research points to lesser-known causes that are proving to be as deadly as the archvillain, sugar.\n\nWhat are diabetogens?\n\nThey\u2019re environmental toxins that act like hormones, and when they enter your body, they trash your immune response. For diabetics, that means one more factor is interfering with normal insulin release and blood sugar control.\n\nSome of the most dangerous diabetogens?\n\nArsenic, found in seafood, poultry, rice, and drinking water\n\nfound in seafood, poultry, rice, and drinking water Bisphenol A (BPA) , used to produce plastics, including food and drink packaging\n\n, used to produce plastics, including food and drink packaging Dioxins, used in countless industrial processes and spewed into the air\n\nused in countless industrial processes and spewed into the air Pesticides, in plants, water, and air around farms\n\nin plants, water, and air around farms Phthalates, that increase durability in plastics, and appear in health and beauty aids, fragrances, and cosmetics\n\nWhat can you do to protect yourself?\n\nI wish I could advise never ingesting any diabetogens, but I can\u2019t. They\u2019re everywhere. But please, at least be aware of their omnipresence, and avoid them when you see them on packaging labels.\n\nI recommend everyone get tested for diabetogens levels. Your doctor can administer or prescribe:\n\nGet My FREE Blood Sugar Report The Drug-Free Diabetes Cure\n\nComplete blood count (CBC)\n\nPlatelet count\n\nHomocysteine\n\nBilirubin\n\nC-reactive protein\n\nUrine and blood tests\n\nIf tests show high diabetogens levels, here\u2019s how to clean up and build up resistance:\n\nBreak a sweat with sauna, detox baths, and exercise. Your body will always give you help when you ask for it. Sweating, for example, will help you with weight loss and blood sugar control. A moderate workout most days of the week is my number one recommendation. Or visit a sauna, or take a detoxifying bath with Epsom salt.\n\nFasting is another excellent detoxer. It doesn\u2019t have to be extreme\u2014just go without food for a certain amount of time. Start by skipping one meal, and increasing what you skip from there. It\u2019s easier than you think\u2013mind over meal.\n\nThere\u2019s also intermittent fasting. You consume low calories (about 500-600) 1 or 2 days a week, and eat normally the remaining days. Of course, when you do eat, it should be only fresh, organic fruits and vegetables, little or no sugar, healthy meats and oils.\n\nCysteine. Cysteine helps produce a powerful antioxidant. It\u2019s found in high-protein foods such as poultry dairy, and eggs. Add these to your diet, or supplement with 600 mg daily of n-acetyl cysteine, which your body can convert into cysteine.\n\nFiber up. Fiber binds to toxins in the gut and sends them packing. Up your intake of organic fruits and veggies\u2014the best source of fiber.\n\nA daily probiotic. Beneficial bacteria do many critical jobs. In the case of diabetogens, research indicates that certain strains of bacteria bind to diabetogens and eliminate them.\n\nBerberine, found in plants like barberry and goldenseal, helps regulate blood sugar and cholesterol. I recommend 1000 mg, divided into 3-4 doses across the day\n\nChromium, an essential mineral, helps to manage your insulin sensitivity. Diabetics tend to have lower blood chromium levels than non-diabetics. I recommend 400 micrograms daily.\n\nAlpha lipoic acid is an antioxidant that helps prevent diabetes by improving insulin resistance, as well as relieving some of its worst symptoms, like neuropathy and retinal damage.\n\nIf you want to try a supplement, finding any or all of these on the ingredients label says you\u2019re on the right track.\n\nMake National Diabetes Month a cause for celebration instead of worry. Start by talking with your doctor.\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
