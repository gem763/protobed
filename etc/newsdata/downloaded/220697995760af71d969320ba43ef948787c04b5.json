There were 486 lawmakers present in the lower house.\n\nThe vote came after three days of debate and was a test for the 16-party coalition government that has a wafer-thin majority in the 500-member house.\n\nHowever, the draft bill still has to go through second and third readings in January before being submitted for royal approval. Opposition politicians, who say the budget allotment was not fairly distributed, could demand changes at these later stages.\n\nThe proposed budget for the 2020 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1 is for 3.2 trillion baht ($105.68 billion), a 6% increase from 2019.\n\nOpposition politicians have criticized the government for a 10% increase in the central budget that can be allocated at the discretion of the former junta leader, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. They are also unhappy with a 2.7% increase in the defense budget that has risen continuously since the military seized power in 2014.\n\nThe opposition said it did not oppose the bill because the budget had already been delayed following elections earlier this year.\n\n\u201cTo vote in favor is troubling but I cannot vote against it because I am worried about the people,\u201d said Sutin Klangsang, a member of parliament for the Pheu Thai Party and chief whip for the opposition.\n\n\u201cI hope we can improve things,\u201d he added. \u201cIf nothing is done then we will vote against you in the third reading and who knows what will happen in the election.\u201d", "description": "Thailand's coalition government, led by a former military junta leader, survived a key parliamentary challenge on Saturday after opponents abstained to let the first reading of its draft 2020 budget bill through.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
