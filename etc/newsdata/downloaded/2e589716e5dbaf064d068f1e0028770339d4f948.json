I\u2019m pretty sure that I still like Biden\u2019s chances better than Warren \u2014 as I said, that\u2019s certainly where a statistical model would come out. But I wouldn\u2019t wager a huge amount of money on that proposition. I think Warren has a few things going for her that Sanders doesn\u2019t \u2014 less voter concern about her age, more room to make peace with the establishment and slightly better polling. But you could argue that they should basically be treated as tied.\n\nI\u2019m also not quite sure what to do with Harris. A \u201cParty Decides\u201d rubric that heavily emphasized endorsements and the ability to build a broad coalition would treat her as one of the favorites, while the polling wouldn\u2019t. Then again, she\u2019s had moments where she was polling better, and she could be poised to benefit if Biden falters among black voters or Warren does among college-educated ones. One reason to be pessimistic about the chances of candidates such as Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke, in fact, is that if something did happen to one of the frontrunners, Harris would probably be first in line to benefit from that.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nate Silver", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features Is-It-Really-A-Three-Candidate-Race"], "top_image": ""}
