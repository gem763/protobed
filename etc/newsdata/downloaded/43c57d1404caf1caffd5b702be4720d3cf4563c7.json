If he means that the country might not reauthorize the Bill of Rights in a take-it-or-leave-it up-or-down vote to either keep the first ten amendments or do away with written guarantees of core rights, he\u2019s obviously wrong. Americans would vote overwhelmingly to affirm their current rights.\n\nBut if he means something more like a constitutional convention, where we\u2019re not just voting to scrap old rights but to replace/supplement them with new ones, he\u2019s obviously, obviously right. Are you kidding? I mean, just run through the list.\n\nFirst Amendment: No clause would escape unscathed. We\u2019d end up having a national conversation about whether to exclude \u201chate speech\u201d from the protections afforded free speech. We\u2019d have a wrenching argument about whether religious freedom should extend beyond the church door and into business places. No doubt social conservatives would want a narrower reading of the word \u201cestablishment\u201d in the Establishment Clause. Freedom to petition the government for a redress of grievances would receive caveats related to lobbying. On and on. The amendment would be a shadow of itself by the time we were done.\n\nSecond Amendment: Again, are you kidding?\n\nThird Amendment: Wouldn\u2019t exist because it\u2019s never been a concern.\n\nFourth Amendment: Natsec hawks would want some exceptions included for the surveillance state in forbidding unlawful searches and seizures. Libertarians would want the provisions expanded to include prohibitions on things like facial-recognition technology in public. Another hash.\n\nFifth Amendment: We\u2019d have another loooong national conversation about what \u201cdue process\u201d means, specifically, with plenty of horse-trading between left and right on what should and shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nCan we stop here? I\u2019m getting depressed. Needless to say, there\u2019d be another long and depressing conversation about what \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d in the Eighth Amendment means too. The new Bill of Rights would be 10 or even 100 times wordier than the old one for the simple reason that both parties would be trying to tie the hands of future Supreme Court justices appointed by the other party as best they can. \u201cDo you really want me to rule the country?\u201d said Neil Gorsuch to CNN in an interview this week about the Court\u2019s outsized power over American life. No, Americans say. One obvious way to prevent rule by judiciary in a scenario in which fundamental constitutional provisions are on the table is to be much more specific with those provisions and narrow the Court\u2019s interpretative discretion accordingly. For that reason alone, Clyburn\u2019s clearly correct.", "description": "Change.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
