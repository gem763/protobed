John Bel Edwards confirmed the death.\n\nThe building was under construction at the corner of Rampart Street and Canal Street, a broad boulevard just outside the Quarter, lined with restaurants hotels and retailers. Canal, which carries six lanes of traffic divided by a wide median where streetcars roll, separates the Quarter from the city\u2019s main business district.\n\nWWL-TV aired and tweeted a viewer\u2019s dramatic video of the collapse, showing upper floors falling on top of each other before one side of the building toppled to the ground.\n\nAnother video on social media was taken by someone aboard one of the city\u2019s famous streetcars as it approached the site while the building was collapsing. It showed what looked like a metal structure \u2014 part of the building or a piece of construction equipment \u2014 tumbling to the ground and people running from the scene as clouds of dust billowed up and around the streetcar, obscuring the view like a thick fog.\n\nAuthorities say 18 people were taken to a hospital for treatment. All were considered stable.\n\nEdwards urged people to stay away from the area, which was still considered unstable. An unsupported crane listed away from the building site. As dust settled following the morning collapse, twisted metal, concrete pilings and other wreckage covered part of Rampart Street.\n\n\u201cIt was a deep rumbling sound,\u201d Matt Worges, who saw the collapse from a nearby building, told The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate. \u201cLike an airplane maybe. It drew my head immediately.\u201d", "description": "NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 A Hard Rock Hotel under construction at the edge of New Orleans\u2019 historic French Quarter collapsed Saturday morning, leaving at least one person dead and three unaccounted for, authorities said.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP_19285562820593-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
