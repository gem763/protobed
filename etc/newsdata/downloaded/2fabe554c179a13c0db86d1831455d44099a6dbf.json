It's competing with devices such as Facebook's Oculus, Sony's PlayStation VR and Microsoft HoloLens.\n\nBut Mr Wood said the challenges Mr Maitre faced \"should not be underestimated\".\n\n\"Not only is he going to be leading a business that needs to re-find its feet in the intensely competitive smartphone market, it's also a company that's betting big on VR [virtual reality], which is still an emerging technology,\" he told BBC News.", "description": "Taiwan's mobile phone company moves away from its founders to appoint a former Orange executive.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6D78/production/_108842082_hi006958248.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
