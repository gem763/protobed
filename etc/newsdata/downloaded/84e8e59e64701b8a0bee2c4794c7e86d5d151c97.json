It is this secret history that can tell us not only where Isis really come from, but why they are not going away any time soon, despite losing their territory.\n\nFor example, this Tuesday is Ashura, one of the saddest days of the calendar for the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims, marking the day the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, Husayn ibn Ali, was killed during the Battle of Karbala, But few Muslims \u2013 and even fewer non-Muslims \u2013 truly understand what happened on this day over 1300 years ago.\n\nThis was the crucial date when, just a few years after Prophet Muhammad\u2019s death, Islam went from being practiced as a divine religion to being a tool used by a regime that, like its modern counterpart, had little interest in faith and more interest in territorial expansion and supremacism.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The hijacking and abuse of Islam goes back a long way and it has been an onlgoing struggle for Muslims to isolate their faith from its often grimey historical context. This is a fact not appreciated by the majority of counter-extremism experts, meaning that much of their work is ineffective or even counter-productive, as policies and strategies are employed which target entire Muslim communities when really the pivot to violence and supremacism has always been isolated to very few marginal and radical individuals.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

But expansionism came at a cost: the brutal Umayyad dynasty who siezed control of Islam had to eliminate all rivals, including the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s own family. It is this injustice \u2013 and the chain of events it led to, where Imperialism in the name of Islam was unleashed on much of the civilised world \u2013 that many Muslims will mourn on Tuesday.\n\nBut this is about much more than history \u2013 it is about how, at the hands of a few self-elected strongmen, extremism and supremacism came to be a common byproduct of Islam\u2019s interaction with the world, to the point where the two are almost indistinguishable to some. It is this blurring of the lines between faith and empire, that has led so many to wonder if Islam can peacefully exist in the modern world. It has also created powerful imagery of Islam\u2019s \u201cglory days\u201d, used by extremists the world over to inspire their impressionable young recruits.\n\nAs many jump between two caricatures of Islam (that it is either an inherently violent and fascistic ideology, or that Muslims are perennially innocent victims of hatred and discrimination) we must understand that there are two Islams, both of which are very real. There is the Islam of the Umayyad dynasty and their modern ideological descendants in Wahhabism and Isis, which is a violent perversion of a harmonious faith. And there is the Islam of the vast majority of the world\u2019s Muslims, which is an Abrahamic faith in the lineage of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nBoth Muslims and non-Muslims do the religion an injustice by confusing the faith with the historical acts committed in its name. There is a western intellectual tradition, going back to Orientalism and the idea of the \u201cClash of Civilisations\u201d that primes some observers to believe that Islam is indeed an agressive, alien force. Many in the far-right seem more comfortable with the idea of being in perpetual conflict with Islam than with an acceptance of a shared Abrahamic tradition among the three major monotheistic faiths.\n\nAt the same time, some Muslims fall into the trap of idealising their own history. Many in the diaspora prefer the self-image of being part of an ancient (albeit militaristic and unjust) empire, than an embattled minority with a range of complexities and often socio-economic disadvantages.\n\nAt the extreme end of this scale are some Islamists who believe that all the problems in the world can be solved merely by the existence of a Caliphate, regardless of its moral compass. The date 1924 (the end of the last Caliphate, the Ottoman Empire) has been immortalised by many activists who want nothing other than a return to Islamic political authority \u2013 whatever the outcome of that regime.\n\nThis idea, that the simple existence of a Caliph (however brutal or barbaric he may be) will solve all the world\u2019s problems, is dangerous. Isis showed what happens when it is taken to its natural conclusion.\n\nBut this ideology is not going to go away: \u201cpower at all costs\u201d has been a belief amongst some Muslims from the time of the Umayyads and the Ashura massacre that will be commemorated on Tuesday.\n\nIt was Yazid, the Umayyad commander, that introduced the Arabs to beheadings and the eating of one\u2019s enemies\u2019 vital organs \u2013 both of which are favoured tactics of Isis. And their sense of supremacism, evident in their exclusion of other tribes and sectarian minorities from power, is still alive today in some parts of the Muslim world.\n\nMost importantly, Yazid used the Quran to justify his war crimes, and called his enemies (including Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Hussain) apostates.\n\nIf all this sounds familiar, it is because Isis themselves do not identify as a 21st century grouping, but rather the continuation of this war that began on the sands of Kerbala, Iraq 1339 years ago. It is a war that is far from over.\n\nSalim Kassam is a community activist and co-founder of TheMuslimVibe.com", "description": "Islam is misunderstood because many of us \u2013 Muslim and non-Muslim \u2013 are ignorant of Islamic history.
