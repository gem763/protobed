Marco Rubio to call for an investigation of the app.\n\nTikTok announced Tuesday it had hired two former congressmen and was convening a panel of outside experts to review its content moderation policies.\n\nChinese firms are also prompting concerns about data privacy.\n\nExperts say TikTok could become China's next big weapon in the race for personal data. \"Think about all the data that TikTok has on American teenagers,\" says Sacks.\n\nIn May, the U.S. government pushed China's Kunlun to sell off the American dating app Grindr over similar worries about data privacy.\n\nAll the while, Washington's rhetoric and policies have grown more hawkish.\n\nCongress has strengthened CFIUS, the Treasury Department's committee for reviewing foreign investments in the U.S.\n\n\"We understand that the program is staffing up in ways that suggest increased scrutiny is the new norm for the foreseeable future,\" says Doug Barry of the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\nBut, but, but: A heavy-handed approach to Chinese firms has a host of consequences.\n\n\"No one should take national security lightly, but the real risk here is government overreach,\" Barry says.\n\nThe government risks making U.S. companies less competitive in the international market by prohibiting them from selling products to Chinese companies \u2014 and pushing those companies to buy the same goods from Japan or South Korea, Barry says.\n\nA true decoupling that gives the U.S. no visibility into technological advancement in China could be \"really dangerous,\" says Sacks.\n\n\"Gene-editing? AI? These are technologies that are going to fundamentally change society, and if China and the U.S. go down completely different paths here, there could be dire consequences for humanity,\" says Sacks.\n\nGo deeper: How Huawei is weathering U.S. sanctions", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-02-25"}
