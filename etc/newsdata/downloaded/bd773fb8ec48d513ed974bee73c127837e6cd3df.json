And yet before the Prime Minister\u2019s new Brexit deal was published yesterday, the Labour leader definitively declared that he couldn\u2019t support it.\n\nThere are two possible explanations for this.\n\nEither Corbyn is a sage who managed to deduce the contents of the unpublished 64-page document.\n\nOr, he jumped in without waiting to read the first page.\n\nHaving seen first-hand the shameless speed with which Corbyn can denounce a deal, forgive me if I lean towards the second possibility.\n\nLabour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn arrives to attend a pre-council meeting of Party of European Socialists at Albert Hall in Brussels on Thursday\n\nOver the past three years, there has been little about Corbyn\u2019s handling of Brexit to suggest he has any inclination to prioritise the Brexit referendum result over the demands of Labour\u2019s own internal party politics. So much for the man who\u2019s party went into the last general election with a manifesto which clearly stated: \u2018Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.\u2019\n\nFaced with a growing Remainer insurgency along his front bench, Corbyn has also ditched his own Eurosceptic beliefs.\n\nWhether, therefore, Corbyn has tried to scupper every attempt to deliver Brexit out of political cowardice or shameless cynicism scarcely matters.\n\nAnd while Boris Johnson has staked everything \u2013 not least his own reputation and premiership \u2013 on making good on that promise, the Labour leader has behaved like a slopey-shouldered spiv trying to welch on a bet. As his actions demonstrated yesterday, Corbyn isn\u2019t one to spend time reading important documents.\n\nBut should he ever start, he could do no worse than begin at page 24 of Labour\u2019s own 2017 manifesto.\n\nTime and again, Corbyn has shown how those key five words \u2013 \u2018Labour accepts the referendum result\u2019 \u2013 aren\u2019t worth the paper they were printed on.\n\nUnder his leadership, Labour MPs opted to trigger Article 50 and set the two-year clock running on Brexit negotiations, but subsequently voted on 34 separate occasions in the Commons to block Brexit legislation.\n\nEven when we were trying to broker a deal with Labour to break the Parliamentary deadlock, I remember how their delegation failed to take the matter at hand seriously. I will never forget one particularly farcical moment in April when, during crunch talks with Labour to get Theresa\u2019s May\u2019s deal through, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, condemned a document we had just given him \u2013 even though it had been copied and pasted from his own proposals!\n\nAt another point, Corbyn\u2019s deputy, John McDonnell (pictured alongside Sajid Javid), suddenly raised the issue of a Second Referendum\n\nAt another point, Corbyn\u2019s deputy, John McDonnell, suddenly raised the issue of a Second Referendum.\n\nI was surprised. At the time, McDonnell had no great love for the Remainer rump of his party.\n\n\u2018I said I\u2019d raise it,\u2019 he explained matter-of-factly, \u2018and I\u2019ve raised it.\u2019 It was a bizarre outburst \u2013 though one that now explains why Corbyn\u2019s self-serving game-playing over Brexit is coming home to roost.\n\nHeld captive by Labour\u2019s hardcore Remainer membership, he has been backed into a cul-de-sac of support for a second referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson has never deviated from the course he set \u2013 to take Britain out of Europe on October 31, \u2018do or die\u2019.\n\nHe has gambled everything on this promise and it seems to have paid off.\n\nIndeed, it means that, tomorrow, there is a clear choice for MPs: back this deal or leave without a deal in less than two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThere are, of course, a handful of honourable former Labour MPs, such as John Mann and Iain Austin, who will do their duty and honour the referendum result.\n\nThere are also decent, moderate Labour MPs, such as Caroline Flint, who voted Remain but have since stated resolutely that Brexit must be delivered.\n\nTomorrow, other Labour MPs would do well to follow their lead.\n\nNow is the time for our politicians to break free from this appalling Parliamentary paralysis, to live up to their promises to voters and get Brexit done.\n\nIf Jeremy Corbyn continues to put the brakes on Brexit, it could plunge Britain into an almighty crash.\n\nSir Robbie Gibb was Theresa May\u2019s director of communications", "description": "SIR ROBBIE GIBB: Before the Prime Minister's new Brexit deal was published yesterday, the Labour leader definitively declared that he couldn't support it.
