The researchers state that teenagers who took the pill reported higher depressive symptom severity than those of the same age not using oral contraceptives.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Teens have lots of challenging emotional issues to deal with so it's especially important to monitor how they are doing.\u201d\n\nTo conduct the research, the team analysed data from female participants in a longitudinal study of teens and young adults from the Netherlands.\n\nEach participant completed a survey with questions about depressive symptoms, such as crying, eating, sleeping, suicidal ideation, self-harm, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, energy, sadness, and lack of pleasure. Their responses were then used to generate a depressive symptom severity score.\n\nThe data showed that, on average, 16-year-old participants who were using oral contraceptives had depressive symptom severity scores that were 21 per cent higher than those who were not taking oral contraceptives, reporting more crying, sleeping and eating problems than their counterparts.\n\n\u201cDepressive symptoms are more prevalent than clinical depression and can have a profound impact on quality of life,\u201d said co-author Hadine Joffe.\n\n\u201cOurs is the first study of this scale to dive deep into the more subtle mood symptoms that occur much more commonly than a depression episode but impact quality of life and are worrying to girls, women and their families.\u201d\n\nDespite the findings, the authors note that the association between oral contraceptive use and depressive symptoms may be bidirectional.\n\nThis means that it could be the contraceptive pill which contributes to symptom severity or that more severe depressive symptoms could the reason teenagers begin taking oral contraceptives in the first place.\n\nOther forms of birth control known as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), deliver hormone exposure to the local uterine.\n\nNow, the investigators are interested in following up this study to determine if hormone exposure that does not go throughout the whole body and brain is less associated with depressive symptoms.\n\n\u201cOral contraceptive users, parents and health care providers should be aware of the increased likelihood of presence of depressive symptoms as it may affect quality of life and adherence to oral contraceptive use,\u201d said de Wit.", "description": "Teenage girls who take the contraceptive pill are at greater risk of suffering symptoms linked to depression, according to a new study.
