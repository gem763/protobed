North Korea has said eight are dead and another four never entered the country.\n\nAbe has vowed to pursue the issue until all those who were taken are returned to Japan.\n\nStaunch US ally Japan and North Korea have been rivals for decades. During periods of tension, North Korea has threatened to rain destruction down on Japan, and North Korea has test-fired missiles into the seas near Japan and even over it.\n\nOn Thursday, North Korea said it had successfully test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile from the sea, to contain external threats and bolster self defence, ahead of fresh nuclear talks with the United States.\n\nJapan condemned the test, saying the missile landed inside Japan's Exclusive Economic Zone, and was a violation of United Nations sanctions.\n\nSouth Korea differences\n\nThe launch was the most provocative by North Korea since it resumed dialogue with the United States in 2018 and a reminder by Pyongyang of the weapons capability it has been aggressively developing.\n\n\"As for the North Korean situation, we will do our utmost to secure the safety of the people, while working closely with the United States and cooperating with the international community,\" Abe said in his speech.\n\nTurning to ties with South Korea, soured by a feud over wartime labour that has spilled over into trade and security matters, Abe reiterated a call for Seoul to observe a promise to Tokyo.\n\nLast October, South Korea's Supreme Court ordered some Japanese firms to compensate Koreans forced to work in their mines and factories during World War II.\n\nJapan, which says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty, calls the court decision a violation of international law.\n\n\"South Korea is an important neighbour. I would like to ask them to observe a promise made between nations, based on international law.\"", "description": "Abe wants to discuss the abduction of Japanese nationals by North Korean agents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/4/67b3009a18b44d879ee1dc6965efcc49_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
