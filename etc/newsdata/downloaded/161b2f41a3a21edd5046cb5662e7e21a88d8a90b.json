After discovering Lydia (Karen Blick) had some cash to her name, Mandy set about acquiring said cash, and made off with it during last night\u2019s episode \u2014 much to the Dingles\u2019 dismay.\n\nHowever, tonight Mandy and Vinny were apprehended by the Dingles, and brought back to the village so that they could get to the bottom of why they stole from Lydia.\n\nDingle Court was called to session, and \u2014 in spite of her hesitation to reveal the truth \u2014 Mandy eventually came clean, and viewers saw her dodgy deals unfold for themselves via a series of flashbacks \u2014 where it was revealed that Charity (Emma Atkins) also took part in said dodgy activities!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Dingles deliberated over Mandy and Vinny\u2019s fate, the pair discussed how the family won\u2019t turn their back on one of their own \u2014 a conversation which led to Vinny revealing that he\u2019s not actually Mandy\u2019s child!\n\nThe Dingles are yet to discover the truth, but this revelation does beg the question of who exactly Vinny is?\n\nCould his alliance with Mandy simply be a part of another scam?\n\nPerhaps, but Mandy seems to genuinely care for Vinny, so there\u2019s likely more to it than just that.\n\nEmmerdale continues Wednesday 30thOctober at 7pm on ITV.\n\nMORE: Emmerdale star confirms long-term split for Cain and Moira Dingle\n\nMORE: Emmerdale spoilers: Aaron Dingle receives devastating news from Robert Sugden\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Mandy and Vinny have been keeping plenty of secrets from the rest of their family, but this is without a doubt their biggest sect to date.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/29_10_emm_dingles_court_02_0-6a4c_1572374462.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
