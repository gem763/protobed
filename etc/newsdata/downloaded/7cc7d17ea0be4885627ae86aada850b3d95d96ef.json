His Ukraine gambit might not be the last effort to pressure foreign governments to discredit Democrats. Mr. Trump has shown that few things can deter him from illegal behavior. The Mueller report only emboldened him: His call to Mr. Zelensky came the day after Mr. Mueller testified before Congress about his findings.\n\nThe president clearly believed the lack of consequences for the actions detailed in the Mueller report gave him a green light to pursue any advantage in the next election \u2014 no matter how unethical or illegal.\n\nThe question now is not if Mr. Trump should be impeached but how. The Democrats\u2019 political model should be the opposite of what Republicans did in 1998. The impeachment of Mr. Clinton was driven entirely by political calculation and played out exactly that way. Democrats going forward need to demonstrate that this is not about politics, but about the Constitution and the presidential abuse of power.", "description": "", "authors": ["Joe Lockhart", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Impeachment-Whistleblower-Complaint.Html"], "top_image": ""}
