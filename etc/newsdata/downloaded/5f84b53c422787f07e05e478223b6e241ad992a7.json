Qatar Airways According to the Skytrax World Airline awards Getty\n\nRyanair takes second place for brevity among the big three European budget airline with its 88-mile hop across the western Mediterranean from Malaga in Spain to Tetouan in Morocco.\n\nJust one mile longer is an easyJet link from the Isle of Man to Liverpool.\n\nThe next six places are also taken by easyJet, with routes almost exclusively within the British Isles \u2013 only Southend-Amsterdam, in eighth place, ventures to Continental Europe.\n\nWizz Air, the third force in European budget aviation, does not make the top 10 of short routes. The Hungarian airline mainly operates in landlocked central and Eastern Europe, where profitable short hops across bodies of water are less readily available.\n\nIts shortest route is from Gdansk in Poland to Malmo in Sweden at 218 miles, with Katowice \u2013 also in Poland \u2013 to the Ukrainian city of Lviv only three miles further.\n\nWhen it comes to the longest routes, Wizz Air is much better represented.\n\nBut top place for ultra-long-haul-no-frills goes to Ryanair for its weekly link from Stockholm Skavsta to Gran Canaria, covering 2,629 miles.\n\nIts route takes the Boeing 737-800 over Denmark, the northern tip of Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, northern France, the northern Spanish mainland and Portugal. But the flight leaves at 7.15pm and touches down just after midnight, so the views will not be spectacular.\n\nThe flight is scheduled to take five hours, 50 minutes. Flying out on 24 November, the fare is 506 Swedish krona (\u00a340) \u2013 for a journey longer than the transatlantic link from Glasgow to Halifax in Canada.\n\nAll the remaining routes in the top 10 are to the Canaries, Egypt or Dubai.\n\nWizz Air\u2019s services to Dubai\u2019s new World Central airport from Katowice in Poland and Budapest are second and seventh respectively.\n\nIn third place, Wizz Air\u2019s trans-European express from Bucharest to Tenerife South traverses Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Italy and Morocco on its way to the sunshine.\n\nHurghada in Egypt is the destination for all four easyJet entries in the top 10. The Red Sea resort is served from Manchester, Bristol, Stansted and Gatwick.\n\nWhen Sharm el Sheikh is back in the easyJet schedules, the link from Manchester will become the fifth longest in Europe.\n\nThe shortest route in the world is on the Scottish airline, Loganair, from Papa Westray to Westray in Orkney. The one-mile flight is scheduled to take two minutes.\n\nThe world\u2019s longest nonstop route is on Singapore Airlines from its hub to New York. The 9,529-mile flight takes 18 hours on a good day.\n\nTop 10 shortest routes from Europe\u2019s top three budget airlines (distances in statute miles)\n\n1. easyJet: Belfast International-Isle of Man (74)\n\n2.
