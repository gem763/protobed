But the Nationals need him to be a great closer, too. (Nick Wass)\n\nHow to be part of a team, according to Washington Nationals reliever Sean Doolittle:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have an ego in the bullpen. At the end of the day, we\u2019re a group,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re only as good as the sum of our parts. Whatever you\u2019re called on to do that day, you\u2019ve got to be willing to do it for the boys. I\u2019ve pitched in a lot of different roles in my career. I\u2019ve been the middle-inning guy. I\u2019ve been a lefty matchup guy. I\u2019ve closed. I\u2019ve kind of done a little bit of everything. So I feel like I have that experience of doing that and being able to get hot and ready to go.\u201d\n\nThis could appear to be a quote from Sunday morning, when Doolittle returned from the injured list and, in a small crowd of reporters, announced that he won\u2019t be the Nationals\u2019 closer for the time being. Or it could have been from Sunday afternoon, following his first appearance since Aug. 24, once he got the last three outs of a 9-3 win over the Miami Marlins.\n\nBut it\u2019s actually from April 9, after a game in Philadelphia, when Doolittle was pressed about entering in the eighth inning instead of the ninth. And that matters right now, on the first day of the most important month of the Nationals\u2019 season, with their mind set on really making something of 2019. It matters that Doolittle won\u2019t grandstand for a role that, at the moment, he knows he isn\u2019t fit for.\n\n[Nationals expand roster with seven September additions]\n\nThe 32-year-old is both healthy and a diminished version of himself. How that\u2019s possible is the most complicating factor for Doolittle, who expects to pitch in low-leverage situations while he rediscovers what makes him dominant. His fastball was between 88 and 90 mph in a rehab appearance for Class A Potomac on Friday. He went to the IL in mid-August with right knee tendinitis and admitted to knee pain, but it was mostly to rest his arm and mind before the pennant race heats up. An up-and-down season went totally south last month. He had never been used this much \u2014 or been this healthy \u2014 so late in a season, and that led to overuse and arm fatigue. His mechanics slipped, and his fastball life followed. His ERA was 7.36 in 15 appearances between the all-star break and his trip to the IL.\n\nStill, Manager Dave Martinez maintained that Doolittle would be his closer upon returning. Then the lefty returned and sat down with Martinez, and they decided, together, that shouldn\u2019t be the case.\n\n\u201cFor now, probably stuff-wise, I\u2019m not ready to be at the back end of a game,\u201d Doolittle said Sunday. \u201cBut I still think I can help the team. Keep guys like [Daniel Hudson] and [Hunter Strickland] and [Fernando Rodney] \u2026 I can keep those guys fresh. I can help get them the ball. I can match up against lefties, with an eye on hopefully getting back into one of those roles in the back end of a game at some point here in the next couple weeks.\u201d\n\nThe bullpen is typically the egoless part of a baseball team. Relievers have to come in on short notice, they sometimes pitch multiple days in a row with tired arms, and they usually make less than their teammates, often on shorter-term contracts while doing so. Yet closers are the exception to that rule, allergic to anything but the ninth inning, often unwilling to bend into different roles.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Doolittle, an exception to that rule, who has been saying all season that he will do whatever Martinez needs. He was ready to when he was the only reliable reliever in Washington\u2019s bullpen. He was ready to again Sunday, when he was open and candid about what he can and can\u2019t offer this club. Changing closers is, in a way, like a football team changing quarterbacks. It\u2019s a narrative. It could lead to grumbling in the clubhouse. But that\u2019s not Doolittle\u2019s style \u2014 and it never has been \u2014 so Martinez can comfortably plug in Hudson, Rodney or Strickland, three pitchers with closing experience, until it\u2019s time for another switch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through this process, coming back off the IL, several times in my career,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just part of the process. Once you get everything synced up and you get that confidence back in your body, sometimes it takes two, three or four outings for that to come back.\u201d\n\nNow comes a reality that extends beyond Doolittle being good for Washington\u2019s clubhouse: The Nationals are going to need him at his best.\n\nThey are going to need him in big spots, in whatever inning, because they aren\u2019t built to succeed without him. The bullpen moves at the trade deadline \u2014 netting Hudson, Strickland and lefty Roenis El\u00edas \u2014 were not made to patch a ninth-inning hole. They were made to complement Doolittle, who is the closer for the best version of this team. He believes the adrenaline of a major league game could get his velocity into the low-to-mid 90s. His average four-seam fastball velocity was 91 against the Marlins on Sunday. He relies on that fastball, throwing it close to 90 percent of the time, but needs clean mechanics to get the necessary spin, movement and deception on the pitch.\n\nAnd the Nationals want to get back to relying on him, whenever the pressure\u2019s highest, whenever there are just three final outs to record. They just can\u2019t do that quite yet.\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nGame 2 against the Marlins: Stephen Strasburg is dominant, and Nats hit September on a roll\n\nGame 1: Nationals not at their best, but it\u2019s good enough to beat the Marlins\n\nBatting practice pitcher Ali Modami is the Nationals\u2019 secret good luck charm\n\nEven during the nonstop MLB season, An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez is with his kids as much as possible", "description": "Doolittle, who will work in low-leverage situations until he is ready for bigger spots, has the right attitude for a trying situation.
