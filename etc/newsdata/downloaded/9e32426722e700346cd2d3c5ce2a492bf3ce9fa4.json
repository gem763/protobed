As a result of the attack, about 15,000 web pages located on the servers of the company were broken.\"\n\nGeorgian President Salome Zurabishvili's website was \"attacked by hackers this afternoon\", her spokeswoman told AFP news agency.\n\n\"Law enforcement agencies are investigating the incident,\" Sopho Jajanashvili said.\n\nInterpress said the website for Georgia's general jurisdiction courts, as well as the pages of a number of government agencies, NGOs and media outlets were also hit.\n\nThe cyberattack also affected servers of Georgia's two major broadcasters, Maestro and Imedi TV, temporarily sending the television stations off the air.\n\nGeorgia's interior ministry said it had launched an investigation.\n\nPrevious incidents\n\nIn 2008, in the run-up to and during the war between Russia and Georgia, Tbilisi accused Moscow of an all-out cyberattack against the websites of nearly all government agencies and the country's leading banks.\n\nRussia denied the allegations but said that \"individuals in Russia\" might have been responsible.\n\nWestern cyber-analysts alleged that Russia's security services had likely played a key role in organising those attacks.\n\nThe United States Cyber Consequences Unit said the 2008 attacks highlighted the need for international cooperation on cybersecurity.\n\nThe two countries' brief but bloody conflict marked the culmination of the spiralling tensions over Georgia's bid to forge closer ties with the West, which has long angered Tbilisi's Soviet-era master, Russia.\n\nSaakashvili lives in a self-imposed exile in Ukraine after his second term as president ended in 2013.\n\nThe fervently pro-Western reformist former leader is wanted in Tbilisi on charges of abuse of power, which he denies.\n\nA number of former top officials from Saakashvili's administration were jailed after his party lost in the 2012 parliamentary elections to the current ruling party, Georgian Dream, headed by oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili.\n\nOpposition parties and Georgia's Western allies have denounced the prosecutions as a political witch-hunt.", "description": "Affected pages display photo of self-exiled former President Mikheil Saakashvili with inscription 'I'll be back!'", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/4ef55cfd77434f7ba4e24e6f404d8f83_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
