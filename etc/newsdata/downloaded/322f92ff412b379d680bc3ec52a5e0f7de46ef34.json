That compares with the satellite photo monitoring already in place, which requires clear skies and between six and 12 days to get comparative images.\n\nThe mayor of Courmayeur, Stevano Miserocchi, has closed a road due to the risk that a 250,000-cubic-meter mass of the Planpincieux glacier could collapse in the Val Ferret, a popular hiking area nearby.\n\nThe alarm was sounded after movements of up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) a day were recorded. Higher-than-usual summer temperatures had formed a deep fissure.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
