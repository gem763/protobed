He sat out Tuesday, one day after crashing into the outfield wall to make a catch.\n\nThe Dodgers\u2018 magic number dropped to four to clinch their seventh straight NL West title.\n\nLos Angeles surpassed the previous NL home run mark of 249 set by Houston in 2000. The Dodgers slugged 12 homers in the series while outscoring the Rockies 28-15.\n\nColorado lost its season-high ninth in a row and 11th straight at Dodger Stadium.\n\nAdam Kolarek (6-3) got two outs for the win.\n\nHyun-Jin Ryu, the NL starter in the All-Star Game, was looking to bounce back after his worst stretch of the season. He ended up with a no-decision after losing three in a row. During that stretch, Ryu\u2019s ERA has jumped from 1.45 to 2.45, the highest it\u2019s been since May.\n\nRyu allowed three runs and six hits in 4 1/3 innings, his third consecutive start in which the left-hander hasn\u2019t gone beyond the fifth inning. He struck out five and walked a season-high four.\n\nPederson had four homers in the series, hitting two of the Dodgers\u2018 seven in a 16-9 victory Monday in which he tied his career high with five RBIs.\n\nIn the finale, Pederson\u2019s two-run drive in the fourth extended the lead to 7-2 and scored Ryu, who singled with two outs to keep the inning going.\n\nSandwiched around Pederson\u2019s homers was a four-run third inning in which the Dodgers played small ball for a change. Corey Seager and Cody Bellinger had RBI singles. Justin Turner grounded into a fielder\u2019s choice that scored Pederson, and Turner came home on Matt Beaty\u2019s groundout to third.\n\nThe Dodgers were limited to one hit by Colorado\u2019s bullpen over the final four innings.\n\nThe Rockies\u2018 runs came on RBI singles by Ryan McMahon, Drew Butera and Ian Desmond.\n\nColorado\u2019s Antonio Senzatela (8-10) gave up five runs for a franchise-record seventh straight game along with four hits in three innings of his fourth straight loss. He struck out one and walked one in his career-high 21st start of the season.\n\nSenzatela is the first major league pitcher to allow five or more runs in seven straight games since 2011, according to Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (left groin strain) threw, but his progress remains slow.\n\nDodgers: INF Alex Verdugo (right oblique strain) will end his rehab stint at rookie-level Ogden because of back soreness. It\u2019s possible he\u2019ll be sent to the team\u2019s spring training facility in Arizona to take at-bats, but he won\u2019t join the team next week in Baltimore. \u2026 LHP Rich Hill (left forearm strain) faces hitters Friday. \u2026 RHP Dustin May faced hitters and his \u201ccommand could have been better,\u201d manager Dave Roberts said. May was struck on the side of his head by a liner in Arizona last weekend. \u2026 INF Max Muncy (broken right wrist) worked in the batting cage and took grounders. His soreness has lessened and the team hopes he\u2019ll return next week.\n\nIN THE SEATS\n\nThe Dodgers topped the 3.5 million mark in home attendance, drawing 3,565,539 through 73 games. They\u2019ve led the majors in home attendance for six straight years and are on pace to break their single-season mark of 3,857,500 set last year. They\u2019re averaging 48,843, the first team since the New York Mets (49,902) and New York Yankees (53,070) in 2008 to average over 48,000.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies: Off on Thursday before RHP Tim Melville (1-1, 3.86 ERA) starts the opener of a three-game set at San Diego on Friday.\n\nDodgers: After an off day, LHP Clayton Kershaw (13-4, 2.96) starts Friday in the opener of a three-game series against rival San Francisco.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joc Pederson hit a leadoff homer and a two-run shot as the Los Angeles Dodgers set a National League record with their 250th long ball this season in beating the Colorado Rockies 7-3 Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/05/rockies_dodgers_baseball_29881_c0-149-3557-2222_s1770x1032.jpg?6f3d9f13cf5f228133dd9abcffbf8c2c12479990", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
