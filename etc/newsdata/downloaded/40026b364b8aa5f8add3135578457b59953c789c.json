Speaking at the Wilson Center in Washington, Pence accused both entities of choosing their business interests in China over American values.\n\nThe criticism stemmed from a dispute between the NBA and China over Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s Oct. 4 tweet in support of pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. The post prompted strong criticism from the Chinese government and the NBA\u2019s sponsors in the country, and the league's initial distancing from the remarks earned the organization a bipartisan skewering by lawmakers.\n\nLater, Silver clarified the league\u2019s stance by expressing support for Moray\u2019s right to freedom of speech, generating renewed backlash in China.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve adhered to our core values from the first moment,\u201d Silver said during an appearance on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d on Thursday night. \u201cTo the extent that there was any doubt about that, we reinforced that those are our core values. And I\u2019ll just say again, once again, we\u2019re going to double down on engaging with the people of China and India and throughout Africa, around the world, regardless of their governments.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. government advises the league not to do business \"in certain territories or countries, we won\u2019t,\u201d Silver added. \u201cBut I\u2019m a firm believer that through sports, independent of governments, you bring people together, they acknowledge that commonality, they create empathy.\u201d\n\nBarkley, the Pro Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and TNT analyst, had a more pointed response.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, Vice President Pence needs to shut the hell up,\u201d Barkley said during an NBA pregame event on TNT. \u201cAll American companies are doing business in China.\u201d\n\nChinese sponsors responded to the controversy by suspending business ties with the league, while state-owned television network CCTV pulled NBA programming off the air. Silver said he rebuffed demands from the Chinese government that Morey be fired.\n\nChina\u2019s boycott of the NBA has stretched into the 2019-20 regular season, and CCTV didn't air the NBA\u2019s slate of opening night games, as it has traditionally done.\n\nPence\u2019s critical remarks toward the NBA came days after President Trump ripped Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr and San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich for failing to speak out against oppression in Hong King.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers star LeBron James also drew universal criticism after he accused Morey of failing to consider the financial ramifications of his Hong Kong tweet.\n\n\u201cSome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\u201d Pence said. \u201cIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly-owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nNike stores in China pulled Rockets merchandise from their shelves in the days after Morey\u2019s tweet. The country's market is one of the fastest-growing segments of the shoemaker's business, generating more than $1 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter alone.\n\n\u201cNike promotes itself as a so-called \u2018social-justice champion,\u2019 but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\u201d Pence said. \u201cNike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager\u2019s seven-word tweet: \u201cFight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nStocks in this Article NKE NIKE INC. $91.47 -0.03 (-0.03%)\n\nNike shares fell slightly in trading Thursday. The company didn't return a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S.-China trade conflict has roiled international markets for months, with each country imposing tariffs on goods manufactured in the other. High-level trade talks between the two nations yielded progress earlier this month and sparked optimism about a truce.\n\n\u201cThe United States does not seek confrontation with China. We seek a level playing field, open markets, fair trade, and a respect for our values,\u201d Pence added.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Vice President Pence accused the NBA and Nike of choosing their business interests in China over American values.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/adam-silver-NBA-commissioner-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
