Dunn died near RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on 27 August.\n\nA few days into their US tour to raise awareness of their campaign, the family were invited to meet Trump at the White House.\n\nTim Dunn, Harry\u2019s father, said: \u201c[Trump] said he was sorry about Harry and then he sprung the surprise that Mrs Sacoolas was in another room in the building and whether we\u2019d want to meet her there and then.\u201d\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that they turned down Trump\u2019s offer to meet Sacoolas: \u201cWe said no because as we\u2019ve been saying from the start, we want to meet Ann S but we want to do it in the UK so the police can interview her. We didn\u2019t want to be sort of railroaded into, not a circus as such, but into a meeting that we weren\u2019t prepared for.\u201d\n\nThe Foreign Office doubts 42-year-old Sacoolas will return to the UK to answer questions about her role in the crash. Dunn said that while Trump did not make a commitment either way, his adviser said Sacoolas would not be returning to the UK.\n\nSacoolas has previously said she was \u201cterribly sorry\u201d about the incident and had \u201cno time to react\u201d when she saw Dunn\u2019s motorbike.\n\n\u201cTo me he [Trump] seemed to really listen and he was surprised Harry was a twin. He didn\u2019t realise he had a twin brother so he expressed he must be feeling the pain a lot more and to be fair to my ex-wife she didn\u2019t let him stop her, she just kept talking and talking and talking. She got her point across very well and he actually listened and he was quite sincere at the end,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nThe family, who met the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, in the UK last week, have also demanded an investigation into the Foreign Office\u2019s (FCO) advice to Northamptonshire police that Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity. They are demanding to see all emails, messages and notes sent in relation to her status.\n\nDunn added: \u201cAt the end, the president did say to Charlotte that she spoke to him quite well and explained to him how would he feel if it was his son, would he do the same? And he said, yes I would be doing the same, and as we were leaving he said perhaps there\u2019s another way I can look into this.\u201d\n\nMark Stephens, a British lawyer advising the Dunn family, disclosed that Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s national security adviser was in the room and said that Sacoolas was never going to return to the UK. The press had also been primed to enter the room.\n\nHe said the family had not been told prior to arriving at the White House that they would be meeting Trump, O\u2019Brien or that Sacoolas would be waiting in the adjacent room.\n\nO\u2019Brien\u2019s presence appears to underscore the reports that Jonathan Sacoolas, Anne\u2019s husband, worked for the CIA, and was not an ordinary diplomat. \u201cMy suspicion is that this is being run by the National Security Agency,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added \u201cwe always said that any meeting between Sacoolas and the family had to be properly prepared with counsellors present, and not to be a set-up curated by politicians for the media\u201d.\n\nHe said if Sacoolas will not return to the UK the family will continue to examine the option of a judicial review of the Foreign Office decision making, or a civil claim in the US courts against Sacoolas.\n\nHe added the only optimism to emerge from the meeting was a promise by Trump to see if the issue could be addressed another way.\n\nAnother family spokesman said: \u201cIt struck us that this meeting was hastily arranged by nincompoops on the run and in particular O\u2019Brien who appeared to be extremely uptight and aggressive and did not come across at all well at a meeting which required sensitivity.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Couple say Trump shocked them by revealing woman involved in son\u2019s death, Anne Sacoolas, was nearby", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin", "Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94d2fac2dd5b9103c7c7ed15b15a02972ff94775/0_95_4321_2592/master/4321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1f1512bce496aa1cdac3896687f54952", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
