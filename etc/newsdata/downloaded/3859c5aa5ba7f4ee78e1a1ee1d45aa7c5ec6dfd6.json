Shortly thereafter, news surfaced Murdock was flagged by USADA for Cardarine metabolites and suspended 20-months as a result.\n\nIt turns out Murdock\u2019s removal from UFC Minneapolis wasn\u2019t due to the USADA flag. It was a result of medical abnormalities. In pre-fight medical testing, Murdock was diagnosed with high grade cerebral tenosis.\n\nWhen he returned home to California, the featherweight fighter underwent further testing and was diagnosed with a rare medical condition called moyamoya. As a result, Murdock will have to undergo a cerebral artery bypass and a craniotomy.\n\n\u201cThis physical just happened to save Vince\u2019s life,\u201d coach and teammate Urijah Faber said in a video posted online. \u201cWe found out that although he wasn\u2019t having any symptoms that he\u2019s got a very rare, rare brain condition.\u201d\n\nFaber detailed how important Murdock has been to the team-oriented vibe in the gym and asked for the MMA community\u2019s help in raising money through a Go Fund Me account titled \u201cSave Vinny\u2019s Brain\u201d.\n\nThe goal is currently set at $195,000 \u2013 half of the total price of the procedure.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty heartbreaking. For those who don\u2019t know Vince, he\u2019s a pretty big part of our team. He\u2019s somebody we\u2019ve named the \u2018Mush Award.\u2019 His nickname, \u2018The Mush\u2019 is the fighter with the biggest heart. He gives it out every single year at the banquet at the end of the year.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been the guy who\u2019s hosted fighters from all over the globe \u2013 the U.S. and across the world as the welcoming committee to our team, our gym. For someone who\u2019s been on this long journey to have his dreams come true, which were taken away from him \u2026 He may have a half functioning brain, but he\u2019s got a full heart.\u201d\n\nThe Go Fund Me description detailed moyamoya and how it\u2019s effecting Murdock\u2019s health:\n\n\u201cMoyamoya is a rare condition in which the blood vessels (internal carotid arteries) that supply blood to the brain become narrowed. This limits the flow of blood to the brain, puts them at risk for stroke, and often times left untreated can result in death. Right now it\u2019s unknown the cause of the condition, possibly genetics. (note that this condition is not fight related) The results of Murdocks MRA, MRI, CT scans show a 95%to complete blockage in the left side of the brain, allowing little to no blood flow, while managing to get blood supply from its reserves or compensation due to the narrowing. There is no telling how long it has been managing or how much longer it will continue compensate for narrowing/blockage. Upon a further consultation with Dr. Steinburg of Stanford University, a more in-depth look at Vincent\u2019s scans show stoke like signs, and recommends a sense of urgency for surgery.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full fundraiser video below:", "description": "UFC featherweight Vince Murdock will have to undergo a cerebral artery bypass and a craniotomy \u2013 a $390,000 surgery.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/vince_murdock.png?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
