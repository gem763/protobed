It took me nearly six months to update \u201chome\u201d on my GPS with my new, non-New York City address.\n\nI\u2019m still in denial that I left. I had signed up for Notify NYC text-message alerts during Hurricane Sandy and never turned them off. I would take comfort in the warnings when I felt especially homesick for the city after moving away. Messages about a snarled commute or some other crisis that would have heightened my anxiety when I lived in New York became sources of reassurance: I was still connected, still in the know.\n\nI would hungrily await the ding of my phone to see what was unfolding: \u201cDue to police activity, expect heavy traffic;\u201d \u201cDue to protest, all lanes of the West Side Highway are closed at 26th Street in both directions;\u201d \u201dDue to an unstable building facade, 29th Street is closed between Sixth and Seventh Avenues.\u201d\n\nOnce in a while, though, an alert would make me grateful that I\u2019d left: \u201cDue to signal problems, expect delays on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, J, L, M, N, Q, R, S, W, and Z trains.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Allison Hope Kahn", "description": "At the D.M.V. in the Bronx, relishing long-distance warnings and more reader tales of New York City in this week\u2019s Metropolitan Diary.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/nyregion/29diary-4/29diary-4-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
