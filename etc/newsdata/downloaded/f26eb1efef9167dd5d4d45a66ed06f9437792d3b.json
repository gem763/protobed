But this week we got evidence that one country may have bucked this trend, and it's a cautionary lesson to not over-apply big global trends to every country.\n\nThat political upheaval comes in many forms: surprise voting results, the vague term \"populism\" referring to nontraditional left or right parties that were less popular in recent decades, or political protests. Often, the intensity of upheaval is a function of how rural or urban an area is.\n\nIn the UK, Brexit opposition is more concentrated in urban areas while support is higher in the countryside. \"Gilets jaunes,\" the growing economic movement also known as the \"yellow vests,\" got their start in the exurban areas outside of French cities. And in the US, 2018 saw a resurgent Democratic Party take a majority in the House thanks to huge gains in the suburbs that overcame staunch Republican support from rural areas.\n\nBut the federal election in Canada showed that the rural-urban divide is not universal and it can be foolish to try to apply global narratives on countries that have their own political quirks. While rural areas were more likely to swing Conservative thanks to huge gains in the Prairie provinces, and Liberals racked up urban wins, the country's fault lines don't cleanly break between progressive cities and a more conservative hinterland.\n\nThe rural-urban divide has reshaped politics\n\nThe series of political shocks that hit the developed world began with the Brexit referendum in 2016. Within England, one of the two nations in the UK to support Brexit, 53% voted to leave. The deepest support for remaining in the EU was found in central London, with 60% voting to remain in the EU. Other cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, and Oxford saw stronger concentrations of \"remain\" votes than the areas surrounding them.\n\nThen in the fall, US President Donald Trump was elected, thanks mostly to a swing in three states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Voters in the Rust Belt and upper Midwest swung hard toward the GOP, and for those states the margins in rural areas of those states were too high for the more blue cities to overcome. Precinct-level maps help to show the degree of divide.\n\nMore recently, French protesters, angered by changes to taxes on diesel fuel, donned the yellow vests and took to traffic circles in towns outside of major cities. The protests grew into a broader political protest against French President Emmanuel Macron, who is often perceived as representing the urban elite.\n\nBut in Canada on Tuesday things looked different.\n\nCanada has avoided the upheaval\n\nThere isn't space for an exhaustive list (please, don't tweet at me with the exceptions), but the divide between urban and rural voters in Canada this election looks much less stark than other countries.\n\nIn Quebec City, of the 10 ridings near the city, two went to Liberals, two went to generally progressive but regionally focused Bloc Quebecois, and the rest went Conservative. Rural Quebec split between Conservatives and Bloc, while Liberals won a few ridings. In Montreal, suburbs were Bloc and the central city was centrist Liberal.\n\nSouthern Ontario looks like a better candidate for rural-urban splits given the concentrated liberal strength around cities and broader Conservative wins in outlying areas. Even then, though, Liberals took a number of Northern Ontario ridings, as did the progressive New Democratic Party. There were also at least three Liberal pick-ups in rural ridings of Southern Ontario while Conservatives got three seats inside the Toronto suburbs.\n\nAlberta has another good example: Conservatives won every riding in Canada's third-largest city of Calgary, and all but one of the ridings around the other major urban center (Edmonton). Oil-pipeline politics turned out to be a far bigger factor in the Alberta vote than any urban-rural divide.\n\nFinally, British Columbia, my home province. Conservatives took most of BC's interior with the exception of one riding, won by the left-wing NDP; the NDP also did well in rural coastal areas with a number of wins. Liberals did well in Vancouver, but still lost four seats to the NDP and three seats to the Conservatives in the suburbs, while Conservatives cleaned up in the farmland of the southeast lower mainland.\n\nAcross the country, the divide between rural and urban voters looked nothing like that of the US. While it's not invisible, there are lots of exceptions which make the Canadian rural-urban gap less stark than what we see in many developed countries.\n\nCanada's Indigenous population are rural progressives\n\nThe question is, why? What is Canada doing to avoid its own rural-urban split?\n\nOne immediate answer is the voting patterns of Indigenous peoples, who make up 5% of the country's population. Headed into the election, the Assembly of First Nations cited a record number of Indigenous candidates, with potential for Indigenous candidates to swing one in five ridings. Strong turnout in 2015 helped Trudeau win that election.\n\nIn many rural areas, Indigenous Canadians are key voting blocs, and they tend to avoid the political right. An IRPP analysis showed five ridings with populations that are majority Indigenous and another 12 that were 20 to 50% Indigenous. Conservatives lost in four of the five majority Indigenous ridings and lost five of the 12 20% to 50% Indigenous ridings. Notably, six of those seven wins came in the Prairies.\n\nAmong the 33 ridings that are 10 to 20% Indigenous, Conservatives won 18, but again they were dependent on the Prairies with 12 of their wins coming from those provinces.\n\nNone of this argues that Indigenous voters assure Conservative losses, but in many ridings they give non-right parties a chance or a big victory, breaking up the consistency of the urban-rural political divide.\n\nCanada's regional differences bridge the rural-urban divide\n\nObviously the indigenous vote doesn't totally explain Canada's ability to avoid the urban-rural political split. Regionalism plays a role too.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois \u2014 who have traditionally advocated for Quebec's independence \u2014 are active only in their home territory, but in that province they can be popular in both the rural and the urban areas.\n\nFor instance, Jonqui\u00e8re or Lac-Saint-Jean are rural ridings where the Conservatives couldn't get into second place, while they did manage outright wins in some ridings around Quebec City. The cultural environment of Quebec clearly doesn't support a clean split along urban-rural ideological fault lines.\n\nIn Alberta, oil-and-gas politics played a huge role in voters' decisions this time around. Calgary saw all of its 10 higher-density ridings vote Conservative as the petroleum-oriented Albertan economy tried to give Conservative leader Andrew Scheer a mandate to build pipelines. That was a more powerful dynamic than any urban versus rural progressive-conservative divide.\n\nFinally, while outlying areas of the British Columbia interior sided with Conservatives' economic message, relatively progressive ridings like South Okanagan-West Kootenay, Cowichan-Malahat-Langford, or Courtenay-Alberni are all rural and sent back NDP candidates, part of a long tradition of relatively left-wing politics in the province.\n\nCanadian election returns show the limits of top-down analysis of big, macro trends when airdropping into countries for short periods. Political tradition, demographics, and institutional history can all be more important than the impulses of the global economy and political narrative.\n\nAnalyses that spend too much time focused on a comfortable narrative that can be reapplied, instead of adding local context, are likely to lead analysts and investors astray.\n\nGeorge Pearkes is the global macro strategist for Bespoke Investment Group.
