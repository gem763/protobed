The legal battles have pitted the First Amendment against LGBT rights and have led to conflicting court rulings.\n\n\u201cDuka and Koski\u2019s beliefs about same-sex marriage may seem old-fashioned, or even offensive to some,\u201d Justice Andrew Gould wrote for the court. \u201cBut the guarantees of free speech and freedom of religion are not only for those who are deemed sufficiently enlightened, advanced, or progressive. They are for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe ruling was limited to the artists and their wedding invitations, and the court noted in its 52-page opinion that the city had not yet filed any action against the business for violating the ordinance.\n\nA Phoenix spokesperson said the city\u2019s anti-discrimination law is still legally valid and remains in effect.\n\n\u201cThe Arizona Supreme Court made a very narrow ruling that one local business has the right to refuse to make custom wedding invitations for same-sex couples\u2019 weddings that are similar to the designer\u2019s previous products,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThis ruling does not apply to any other business in Phoenix.\u201d\n\nThree of the court\u2019s justices disagreed with the majority\u2019s ruling, saying the city\u2019s law does not regulate speech, only conduct.\n\n\u201cOur constitutions and laws do not entitle a business to discriminate among customers based on its owners\u2019 disapproval of certain groups, even if that disapproval is based on sincerely held religious beliefs,\u201d read the dissent authored by Justice Scott Bales, who retired this summer.\n\nLGBT advocates decried the court\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cThis ruling is dramatically at odds with decisions by courts across the country that have instead refused to create a religious license for businesses to exempt themselves from civil rights laws, and to pick and choose their customers according to their own religious criteria,\u201d said Jennifer Pizer, senior counsel at Lambda Legal.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling for a Christian baker who refused to bake a custom cake for a same-sex wedding. The court said Colorado\u2019s Civil Rights Commission showed religious animus to the baker, ruling for him on those narrow grounds.\n\nSince the decision, other courts have ruled both for and against plaintiffs in similar situations.\n\nA florist has appealed to the Supreme Court after the Washington Supreme Court ruled against her for refusing to create floral arrangements for a same-sex wedding.\n\nBut in Minnesota, a film company wishing to enter the wedding business but refusing to work with same-sex couples won in federal court last month.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
