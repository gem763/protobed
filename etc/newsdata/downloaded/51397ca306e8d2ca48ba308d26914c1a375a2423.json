Critics have likened the dynamic to online gambling. Yang said that if loot boxes are to exist, game developers should be more transparent with the odds of getting the virtual loot.\n\n\u201cIt will cost you additional money in the real world,\" Yang said, adding that players are being asked to enter into another contract with the game publisher beyond the cost of simply purchasing the game. \"We need to be able to empower players to express their economic preferences up front.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYang said that although it\u2019s \u201cperfectly understandable\" for corporations to seek more money from an established customer base, in-game economies like loot boxes need more transparency to benefit the consumer.\n\nThe inclusion of loot boxes in games has become one of the industry\u2019s most controversial business practices and was adopted from mobile gaming. After spending money on a game\u2019s retail price, a player may be asked to spend more money to buy digital \"boxes\u201d containing randomized digital content like new player outfits or weapons. The random returns on the spend have drawn comparisons to pulling the lever on a slot machine or opening a pack of trading cards. The outrage over the mechanic came to a head when Electronic Arts infamously crammed the mechanic into a Star Wars game, a move that upset Disney executives.\n\nThe tactic is now being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission at the insistence of Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.). Belgium has already outlawed loot boxes. And in China, companies are required to do exactly what Yang proposes and disclose the odds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhile Yang aligns with China\u2019s policy in that instance, when it comes to free speech and gaming, Yang, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, differs. The NBA and Activision Blizzard, two giant U.S.-based entertainment behemoths, both found themselves in a geopolitical firestorm when they had to contend with statements supporting Hong Kong protesters made by people associated with those entities. The NBA supported the rights of Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who made the pro-Hong Kong statement via Twitter, whereas Activision Blizzard punished players who expressed similar sentiments.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is two of China\u2019s driving priorities starting to be at odds with each other,\u201d Yang said. \u201cTheir priority is maintaining robust economic growth. Number two is social order and suppressing any political dissidence. ... The unfortunate reality is that these are the kinds of decisions we\u2019re forcing companies to make every single day because of the globalized nature of the industry.\"\n\nYang, a tech investor, said that the situation seems similar to the complaints he hears from executives who aren\u2019t well equipped to tackle broad global issues over human rights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cA lot of these companies are like, \u2018Why am I making these decisions?\u2019\u201d Yang said. \u201cAnd these decisions end up being massive investments of resources. They\u2019re actually looking for some sort of guideline or assistance. These are from companies who have historically not been excited about having any government hand in their industries. It just goes to show we\u2019re putting more and more companies into untenable positions.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Yang has thought about the serious impact of gaming. In his book, \u201cThe War on Normal People,\u201d Yang wrote about how gaming brings an immediate sense of reward not found in low-wage work, and how the poorest among us tend to spend more time online, which often means more time gaming online, according to the book.\n\nYang believes gaming addiction is a real and underreported problem, and that it should be recognized as a legitimate issue. But as far as the ability of violent games to foster violent tendencies in people, Yang said it just speaks to politicians\u2019 detached sense of the industry and hobby. It\u2019s similar to the aloofness displayed when U.S. lawmakers tried to grill Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, he said, only to showcase how little they understand how Facebook works.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey misunderstood Facebook and they\u2019re certainly behind the curve when it comes to artificial intelligence,\u201d said Yang, speaking to the issue of automation and labor, one of the pillars of his presidential campaign. \u201cAnd for video games, no one ever talks about it unless it\u2019s in the context of violence, and even then you just get some hand wringing behind it.\u201d\n\nThe deeper causes of the problems pinned on video games, Yang said, are economic and educational.\n\n\u201cTo me, games are intrinsic to the human experience, and video games are a natural evolution,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThere is vast potential for gaming to serve not just for our entertainment, but for other positive things.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate believes game publishers need to provide players with more information regarding the randomized in-game transactions.", "authors": ["Gene Park"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9fO3ftiQB0KJgvCjGpPsDmJ8C7I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AFZQNXXULAI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
