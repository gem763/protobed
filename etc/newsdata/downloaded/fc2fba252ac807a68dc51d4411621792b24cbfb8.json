She says she made a comment to Hamilton that upset him, so he threw a full bottle overhand at her, hitting her in the chest, then began cursing and shouting at her. He pulled away the chair on which she rested her feet and threw it, breaking the chair. It didn\u2019t hit her, but he then grabbed her by the shoulders and lifted her from the chair on which she sat. She fell to the floor from which he lifted her, threw her over his shoulder and carried her to her bedroom.\n\nThe girl said at this point she was telling Hamilton, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d Upon reaching her bedroom door, he tossed the teen onto her bed, pressed her face onto the mattress and began hitting her legs with an open hand and closed fist.\n\nShe said that after he finished striking her, he told her, \u201cI hope you go in front of the fucking judge and tell him what a terrible dad I am so I don\u2019t have to see you anymore and you don\u2019t have to come to my house again.\u201d\n\nAs he left the room, he told her to gather her things for school. When she replied that she had already put them in the car, he responded, \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you just the perfect child.\u201d\n\nThe Dallas Morning News reports Hamilton\u2019s ex-wife Katie Hamilton, the mother of the children, had sought a protective order for the girl against Hamilton earlier this month.\n\nHamilton played for the Texas Rangers, Cincinnati Reds and Los Angeles Angels. He has an unlisted telephone number and couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. It was unclear if he has an attorney.", "description": "The former All-Star slugger and AL MVP has been charged with injury to a child after his 14-year-old daughter told his ex-wife that he\u2019d struck her", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c15a8dc87c1acd7d0c1432b6d7010a2f4907fb4c/12_0_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=000c055c844576df69d2ec3f57a9934a", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
