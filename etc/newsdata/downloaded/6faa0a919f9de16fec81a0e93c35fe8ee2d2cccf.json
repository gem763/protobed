This president is trying to change that.\n\nAll Andy Johnson wanted to do was build a pond.\n\nAndy, a welder, and his wife, Katie, have four girls and a small farm in Wyoming, and they needed a place for their horses and cattle to drink and graze.\n\nWorking with state engineers, Andy and Katie spent hours, as well as most of their savings, constructing the pond, filling it with filtered water, providing a habitat for trout, ducks, herons, moose and bald eagles.\n\nApproximately two years later, the project came to a screeching halt when bureaucrats from the Environmental Protection Agency knocked on Johnson\u2019s door, informing him that, by building a pond on his own property without their permission, he had violated the Clean Water Act.\n\nTheir endless battle with bureaucrats\n\nAnd so began a years-long back and forth between Johnson and the EPA, with Johnson presenting documentation from the state showing that his stock pond was exempt from the Clean Water Act and studies that showed his pond provided positive environmental benefits. The EPA, however, claimed that the rocks, sand and concrete Johnson used to create the dam and spillway were pollutants.\n\nAnd the EPA \u2014 an agency in possession of armed enforcement \u2014 was not about to let Johnson live peacefully with his pond. He had 90 days to rip out the pond and fill it in or be subject to $16 million in fines.\n\nEditorial Board: Donald Trump pollutes America with California scheming\n\nThough he likely didn\u2019t know it, Johnson was in good company.\n\nIn 2007, Mike and Chantell Sackett were threatened by the EPA with $75,000 a day in fines for trying to build a house on their own property, across the road and 500 feet away from Priest Lake in Idaho.\n\nCharles Johnson, a Massachusetts cranberry farmer, spent millions of dollars fighting the agency for 22 years for the right to farm his own land. He finally settled in 2012, at the age of 80.\n\nIn Washington, D.C (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nKevin Lunny lost his family\u2019s oyster company in California when the Department of the Interior granted itself limitless discretion to reissue the required permit and argued that Lunny didn\u2019t have the right to sue.\n\nIn Alaska, the Army Corps of Engineers denied Richard Schok the ability to expand his pipe fabrication business when they claimed that permafrost \u2014 the subsurface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year \u2014 was actually a wetland.\n\nAll of these cases share a common feature: They arose from unelected bureaucrats making completely selective decisions about how a law should be interpreted and enforced, without the oversight or input of Congress or the public.\n\nIn bureaucrat-speak, these decisions are often referred to as \u201cguidance documents\u201d or \u201cadvisory opinions\u201d and represent an agency\u2019s way of \u201cinterpreting\u201d regulations and statutes.\n\nBut unlike formal regulations, guidance documents simply arise from an agency\u2019s whim. There is no transparent process with statutory requirements for ample legal justifications, cost benefit analysis and a process for public comment and assessment.\n\nRather, agency bureaucrats simply decide that a policy will exist, and then will it to life. They are then free to enforce it on unsuspecting Americans, who often have little clue that such a document or policy even exists.\n\nThe enormous authority of these unelected administrators\n\nThe subjective, secretive nature of the process has led one critic to deem it \u201cregulatory dark matter.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cgovernment by memo\u201d is how the Obama administration effectively mandated that colleges lower the burden of proof in sexual assault tribunals on their campuses in 2011.\n\nTwo years later, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a bulletin informing that auto lenders would be liable for racial discrimination based on the makeup of their lending portfolios.\n\nIn 2015, the Department of Labor upended the entire labor market with a blog post announcing it was now classifying some independent contractors as full-time employees.\n\nThis type of murky, unclear, bureaucrat-driven style of regulating is exactly what Americans fear from the administrative state. It is, essentially, bullying by the government. Indeed, in the Sackett case, the EPA claimed the couple did not even have the right to challenge the agency\u2019s finding in court. (The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the agency in 2012.)\n\nThe Trump administration is taking welcome steps to stop the bureaucratic bullying. With the signing of two executive orders last week, the administration is requiring that these guidance documents be subject to transparent formulation and notice before enforcement. Critically, these orders also make sure ordinary Americans have the ability to challenge the government\u2019s determination against them.\n\nSen. John Barrasso: President Trump made the right pick for EPA\n\nThis is a relief to those whose lives have been upended by government policy decisions quite literally made in secret and enforced against them with little to no legal recourse.\n\nAmericans generally play by the rules \u2014 but they have to know what they are. These two new executive orders are a welcome step by the Trump administration, and a vital part of their continued efforts to rebalance the relationship between regular Americans and the powerful colossus that is the administrative state.\n\nRachel Bovard is the senior director of policy for the Conservative Partnership Institute and co-author of the book \"Conservative: Knowing What to Keep.\" Follow her on Twitter: @rachelbovard\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
