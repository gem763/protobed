In her work as a psychologist, Breithaupt says, she has seen patients who, after an infection, \u201chave really rigid thoughts and impressions about either food or weight or its shape, or they might have lots of concerns about fat in foods and fat in their body.\u201d Carandang\u2019s PANDAS patient, too, seemed to first grow obsessed with food, then fixate on avoiding it.\n\nNo one knows exactly why, precisely, infections might spark eating disorders. Breithaupt suggests that either the infection itself or the antibiotic used to treat it might be disrupting the patient\u2019s gut microbiome, the collection of microorganisms in the intestine that plays a role in health and disease. This disruption might change the amount of chemicals called neuropeptides circulating in the gut. Because the gut communicates with the brain, the quantities of neuropeptides circulating in the brain might then change, as well. That could, in essence, make people think differently about food or their body.\n\nPerhaps other mechanisms are at play. One competing theory is that the body\u2019s own immune response to an infection might end up invading the brain. When the body senses a dangerous bug, it produces proteins that destroy the invader. But some of those proteins can also attack our own cells. In possible cases of anorexia or bulimia induced by bacteria, some scientists suspect that these proteins get into parts of the brain that control impulses such as disgust and hunger. There, they might attack the brain tissues or switch on the \u201cI\u2019m not hungry anymore\u201d impulse, or even the \u201cI\u2019m disgusted by my own body\u201d impulse.\n\nThere\u2019s no direct evidence for these theories; for now they\u2019re merely speculation. And even if one of them proved correct, researchers would still have to contend with the mystery of why people get infections all the time but relatively few develop eating disorders. Or, for that matter, why not everyone with an eating disorder recently dealt with an infection.\n\nIt might be that underlying factors about people predispose them to developing an eating disorder after an infection. \u201cMaybe you have more of a genetic risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder or anorexia, and the infection then unmasks that vulnerability. That\u2019s one possibility,\u201d says Kyle Williams, the director of the pediatric-neuropsychiatry-and-immunology program at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children.\n\nIf confirmed, these findings could eventually affect how eating disorders are treated, leading doctors to check if their eating-disorder patients have any lingering infections, Breithaupt says. The results also have the potential to radically change our notion of the many ways eating disorders might originate. While most professionals acknowledge that anorexia and bulimia are deeply psychologically rooted, some eating-disorder patients still face stigma for supposedly being so \u201cvain\u201d as to starve themselves. It\u2019s less likely that people would accuse a person of getting meningitis on purpose. Similarly, people who are attacked for compulsively dieting out of vanity might simply be under the spell of antibodies gone awry.", "description": "Common infections such as strep throat might have a mysterious link to anorexia and bulimia.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/shutterstock_1061378300/facebook.jpg?1571354933", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
