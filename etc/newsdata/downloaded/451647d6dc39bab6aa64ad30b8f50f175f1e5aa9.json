We are confident in the facts and look forward to seeing our company exonerated in court.\"\n\nThe New York attorney general's office had no immediate comment on Monday.\n\nThe attorney general sued Exxon in October 2018 under the Martin Act, a New York State law that had been used primarily to go after financial fraud.\n\nThe lawsuit claimed Exxon falsely told investors it had properly evaluated the impact of future climate regulations on its business using a \"proxy cost\" of up to $80 per tonne of carbon emissions.\n\nHowever, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe attorney general also accused the company of failing to account properly for the costs of potential regulation in determining the value of its oil and gas reserves.\n\nThe state of Massachusetts is separately investigating whether Exxon concealed its knowledge of the role that fossil fuels play in climate change.\n\nBoth Massachusetts and New York states began investigating Exxon after news outlets reported in 2015 that the company's own scientists had determined that fossil fuel combustion must be reduced to mitigate the impact of climate change.\n\nThose reports, by InsideClimate News and the Los Angeles Times, were based on documents from the 1970s and 1980s. Exxon said the documents were not inconsistent with its public positions.\n\nExxon and other oil companies including BP Plc, Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell Plc face lawsuits by cities and counties across the US seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change.", "description": "This is the first of several climate-related lawsuits pending against major oil companies slated to go to trial.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/22/8ee3f1e8761349d3b88c47263228f84d_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
