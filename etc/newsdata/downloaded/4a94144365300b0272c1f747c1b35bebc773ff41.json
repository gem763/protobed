One of her neighbors, 62-year-old James Smith, told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he\u2019d called the non-emergency police number to report her door being open because he knew her 8-year-old nephew was staying in the house with her. Police have not confirmed whether the child was also found in the home, however.\n\nBody-camera footage obtained by the Star-Telegram shows two officers\u2014both equipped with flashlights\u2014checking the perimeter of Jefferson\u2019s home before walking around the side of the house to open the gate into the backyard. The officer in the backyard \u201cobserved a person standing inside the residence near a window,\u201d authorities said, and started to shout.\n\n\u201cPut your hands up! Show me your hands!\u201d the officer is heard yelling with his gun drawn.\n\nThe officer, who has not been identified by the Fort Worth Police Department, then fired a single shot through the window, the statement said.\n\n\u201cOfficers entered the residence locating the individual and a firearm and began providing emergency medical care.\u201d\n\nPolice did not specify if Jefferson was holding the weapon when she was fatally shot. It also remains unclear if the officers knocked on the door and identified themselves before examining the perimeter of the house with flashlights.\n\nAccording to Smith, the officers had parked around the corner from Jefferson\u2019s home, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have been able to see them.\n\nCivil-rights attorney Lee Merritt, who said his office is representing Jefferson\u2019s family, wrote on Facebook that she was playing video games with her nephew \u201cwhen they heard what they believed to be a prowler creeping around the back window of the home.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen she went to see what was going on she was confronted by an officer with his gun drawn shouting commands. With just seconds to comply, she was shot through the window,\u201d Merritt wrote.\n\nThe officer who fired the shot, who has been on the force since last April, \u201chas been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the critical police incident investigation,\u201d police said. The Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s Office confirmed to The Daily Beast they are looking into Saturday\u2019s incident but have declined to provide details due to the \u201congoing investigation.\u201d\n\nWhile police released some body camera video of the incident Saturday in order to \u201cprovide transparent and relevant information to the public,\u201d they noted they are unable to release video from inside the house, citing state law.\n\n\u201cThe Fort Worth Police Department shares the deep concerns of the public and is committed to completing an extremely thorough investigation of his critical police incident to its resolution,\u201d the statement concluded.\n\nSmith told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he was struggling with the aftermath of what happened when he\u2019d simply been trying to look out for the safety of his neighbor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shaken. I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m upset. And I feel it\u2019s partly my fault,\u201d Smith told the newspaper, adding that he was just trying to be a good neighbor. \u201cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\u2019d still be alive.\u201d\n\nThe body footage shows that while the screen door was closed, the front door was open and the lights were on inside the house. Smith, who watched the incident, told WFAA he is confused by the officer\u2019s decision not to knock or announce himself when trying to enter the house\n\n\u201cI called my police department for a welfare check. No domestic violence, no arguing, nothing that they should have been concerned about as far as them coming with guns drawn to my neighbor\u2019s house,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t feel safe with the police department, then who do you feel safe with?\u201d", "description": "\u201cIf I had never dialed the police department, she\u2019d still be alive,\u201d one neighbor said of the Saturday morning incident.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3132,w_5568,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570918106/GettyImages-1054445058_1_ouqlvz", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
