(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nOne day this past spring, still early in free agency, Ereck Flowers found himself in a meeting room at the Washington Redskins\u2019 team headquarters. In front of him was a video screen. Around him were Bill Callahan, the team\u2019s offensive line and assistant head coach, and other coaches and front-office members.\n\nThey were showing him video from the first four years of his NFL career. This was not a happy event; Flowers\u2019s time as a tackle for the New York Giants and briefly the Jacksonville Jaguars had been a major struggle.\n\nBut as the Redskins\u2019 people showed Flowers the video, they had an interesting proposition for him.\n\nWe want you to be a guard.\n\nFlowers was surprised. He had been a tackle his whole career, from high school in Miami, where he was a four-star recruit, to the University of Miami, where he started for three seasons before becoming a first-round pick, to the Giants and Jaguars. But his career had stalled. \u201cBust\u201d was a word often used about him in New York.\n\nPlay guard? What did he have to lose?\n\nIt is far too soon to declare the move a success, by Flowers\u2019s own admission. But of all the things that haven\u2019t gone well for the Redskins through the season\u2019s first two weeks, the seemingly most far-fetched experiment isn\u2019t one of them.\n\nPlaced on a thrown-together left side of the line with Donald Penn \u2014 signed in training camp because of Trent Williams\u2019s holdout \u2014 Flowers has been solid. The analytics website Pro Football Focus gives him a grade of 61 on its 0 to 100 scale, which ranks 38th out of 70 players at the position. He has allowed quarterback Case Keenum to be pressured four times and has been penalized twice.\n\n[Redskins send Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to injured reserve, sign Noah Spence]\n\nWhile that might not be a fantastic set of numbers for an offensive lineman, he has survived \u2014 an impressive feat at a position he only learned a few weeks ago \u2014 against two of the NFL\u2019s better defensive lines in Philadelphia and Dallas.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t jump the gun yet,\u201d Flowers said Wednesday as he sat in his locker at the team\u2019s practice facility. \u201cIt\u2019s only been two games. I\u2019m just trying to get better.\u201d\n\nBut he is the happiest he has been since coming to the NFL, playing a position that it turns out he loves. The weird suggestion made in a meeting room upstairs turns out to have been the best thing he could have been asked to do. At guard the game comes quicker than at tackle. It\u2019s more physical, and he has to communicate more with the men beside him. He has found he prefers that to the isolation of tackle, where you are often left alone to deal with what is usually the opposing team\u2019s best pass rusher.\n\nAnd to think he has a former basketball star at the University of Mississippi to thank.\n\nIn 2008, Jermey Parnell was a bruising power forward averaging 13.6 minutes and 2.0 fouls a game at Mississippi, when he decided to try football \u2014 a sport he hadn\u2019t played since eighth grade. The Mississippi coaches played him on the defensive line, and he wound up playing the position for parts of two seasons in the NFL with the New Orleans Saints and Miami Dolphins, though never in a regular season game. Finally, in 2010, he joined the Cowboys and was converted into an offensive lineman. Callahan became Dallas\u2019s offensive line coach in 2012, and he eventually molded Parnell into a starter. Three years later, Parnell signed a $32 million contract with Jacksonville.\n\nFlowers and Parnell became friends when Flowers signed with the Jaguars after the Giants released him this past October. They talked a lot about Parnell\u2019s story and about the offensive line coach now in Washington who had helped to make him a reliable offensive lineman. Flowers was intrigued. He admired the technique Parnell used, which had been taught by Callahan.\n\nThen, when the Redskins called this past spring, he was very interested.\n\nAt first he didn\u2019t get to play guard. Because of Williams\u2019s holdout and injuries to other players, he spent most of the offseason workouts at tackle while trying to think about playing guard at the same time. He struggled in some of the open workouts, leading some fans and media members to suggest his signing was a disaster.\n\nAt the time, Callahan insisted Flowers would become a good guard, saying: \u201cIt gives us size. It gives us power.\" But it wasn\u2019t until a week before the first preseason game that Flowers finally went back to guard. The transition wasn\u2019t simple, especially because it was happening in the middle of preseason games with everyone watching \u2014 and criticizing.\n\nBut he admired the way the Redskins linemen all used Callahan\u2019s techniques. The words of Parnell echoed in his head: \u201cThis stuff works.\u201d\n\nAnd as he adjusted, he kept glancing to his right, past center Chase Roullier to the other guard, two-time Pro Bowl honoree Brandon Scherff. He could see Scherff using the same techniques he was being taught and tried to mirror Scherff\u2019s movements, watching how Scherff attacked the defensive tackles. Soon he found he was getting more comfortable, almost content.\n\nFlowers looked around the locker room Wednesday, at his teammates shouting and laughing, Scherff teasing him on the way back from taking a shower. Flowers chuckled. Monday night will bring another test, an even more aggressive, attacking defense with the Chicago Bears and superstar pass rusher Khalil Mack. This time on national television. He knows it will be a challenge.\n\nBut for now, at least, everything is fun.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nToo many near-misses doom the Redskins in a frustrating loss to the Cowboys\n\nCase Keenum is part of the solution, but the Redskins\u2019 problem might be too big\n\nFor the Redskins, 0-3 would mean doom.
