Long story short, investors piled into momentum, growth stocks over the summer as recession fears dominated the market because those stocks, with their non-cyclical tailwinds, can head higher even if the economy weakens.\n\nGE Stock Investors Want the Real GE to Please Stand Up More\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nFears of a recession, however, have cooled substantially over the past few weeks. As a result, many investors have sold their popular momentum stocks, and bought beaten-up, economically-sensitive value stocks.\n\nAmid this huge market shift, GE stock price has rallied. Over the past two weeks, General Electric stock is up more than 15%. Now the question is, will GE stock price continue to climb?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI think it will, for three main reason. First, the fundamentals and valuation of GE stock look good under $10. Second, the outlook of the industrials sector should improve over the next few months. Third, the technicals imply that GE stock is in the first few innings of a multi-month breakout.\n\nConsequently, while the rally of General Electric stock has been put on hold for the past few months, it looks like the shares are about to start climbing again. Over the next few months, I think GE stock can and will grind higher.\n\nThe Fundamentals of GE Stock Look Good Under $10\n\nWhen it comes to the fundamentals underlying GE stock, there are two main things to watch: debt reduction and operational simplification. That is, in order for GE stock to head higher and act like a normal industrial name, management needs to reduce the company\u2019s high debt load and simplify and optimize its operations.\n\nRight now, management is successfully doing both of those things.\n\nOver the past six months alone, General Electric has sold its aviation lending business, its biopharma unit, and its commercial LED and traditional lighting business. By taking those steps, the company has done two things. One, it\u2019s reduced the number of businesses owned by the company.As a result, GE will be able to allocate more resources to its more important, more relevant, and more profitable businesses, like Aviation. Two, it\u2019s generated billions of dollars from these asset sales, which it\u2019s used to reduce its debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, GE\u2019s management is doing everything it needs to do to make GE smaller, simpler, more profitable, and less indebted.\n\nAs long as the company remains on this trajectory, then current Street estimates calling for earnings per share of 90 cents by fiscal 2021 seem entirely reasonable. At that time, GE stock should trade like a normal industrial stock, as its headwinds move into the rear-view mirror. Industrial stocks normally trade around 15 times their estimated forward earnings. A forward multiple of 15 on an estimated 2021 EPS of 90 cents implies a 2020 price target of roughly $13.50 for General Electric stock.\n\nGE stock trades under $10 today. Thus, over the next 12-16 months, the fundamentals imply that GE stock price can jump 35%-plus.\n\nThe Outlook of the Industrial Sector Should Improve\n\nThe outlook of industrial stocks have been depressed by economic slowdown fears for the past several months. But those fears are starting to ease now. They should continue to ease for the foreseeable future. As they do, investors\u2019 view of the industrial space will improve, lifting the whole sector, General Electric stock included.\n\nIn a nutshell, markets were very worried in August 2019 that a recession was looming, mostly for three reasons. First, global data was indicating that the economy was slowing. Second, the Fed didn\u2019t sound super dovish in late July. Third, President Trump upped the trade-war ante with China, causing long-term interest rates to drop below short-term rates., In the past, that situation has usually indicated that a recession will occur soon.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Shares of General Electric (NYSE:GE) have shown some life recently amid a massive shift in the financial markets from momentum names to value names.
