Of those patients, 1 772 had interval breast cancer.\n\nWomen with interval breast cancer were more likely to be previously or later diagnosed with another type of cancer, such as lung, colon and skin cancer, the investigators found.\n\nCompared to those without interval breast cancer, patients with interval breast cancer who also had another type of cancer were three times more likely to have a family history of multiple cancers. This suggests that rare genetic mutations may play a role in their cancers, according to Felix Grassmann, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, and colleagues.\n\nTheir report was published online in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe findings may be useful in updating cancer prevention programmes, the researchers suggested in a journal news release.\n\nThat could include providing additional screenings for certain people and increasing awareness among interval breast cancer survivors and their relatives.\n\nThe study authors also said that further research is needed to pinpoint rare genetic mutations that may be associated with interval breast cancer and other cancers.\n\nImage credit: iStock\n\n", "description": "Investigators found that women with 'interval breast cancer' were more likely to be previously or later diagnosed with another type of cancer, such as lung, colon and skin cancer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9509/a43a7f8518f641db90893a6bf0fb506c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
