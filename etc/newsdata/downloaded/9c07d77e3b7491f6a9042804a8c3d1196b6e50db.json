Kimberly died of the disease at age 17 in 2012. Wukovits says parents need to ask their children\u2019s doctors specifically about meningitis B and not assume it\u2019s covered as part of the main vaccination their children routinely receive. (Glamour Shots)\n\nThe first clue Aracelly Bibl had that something was wrong with her 18-year-old son in February was when his girlfriend called at 8:23 p.m. and said he had a mysterious red rash all over his chest, a fever and flulike muscle aches. \u201cTake him to the ER,\u201d Bibl told her.\n\nThe next call came from the emergency-room nurse at 10 p.m. asking Bibl to come to the hospital immediately. Doctors suspected her son, Joseph Clouse, had meningitis B, a deadly bacterial infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord, and had started treating him with IV antibiotics.\n\nThe family had barely started the \u00ad2 1 2 -hour trip from their home in Santa Cruz, Calif. to San Luis Obispo, where Joseph was studying at a community college to be a firefighter, when the nurse called again around 11:30 p.m. Clouse had gone into cardiac arrest. \u201cWe worked on him for an hour,\u201d Bibl recalls her saying. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t bring him back.\u201d\n\nSince her son\u2019s death, Bibl has tried to make sense of his swift-killing illness. She\u2019d dutifully taken him to his pediatrician for required vaccinations just a year earlier, which included a booster shot for four meningitis strains (known as the meningococcal conjugate vaccine, or MenACWY) that\u2019s routinely given to children at age 11 or 12 (with a recommended booster at 16). But she\u2019d never heard about meningitis B or that two vaccines for it had been on the market for several years.\n\n\u201cThe doctor never brought it up,\u201d Bibl says. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t even a poster in his office.\u201d\n\nFirst vaccine for deadly form of meningitis is approved in U.S.\n\n\n\nVictoria Mattison at age 16. A Clemson University student, she died in May of the bacterial infection at age 20. (Takiea Petty)\n\nMeningitis B is caused by bacteria that live in the nose and throat and can be spread through close contact, such as sneezing or kissing. It may start as a flulike illness but can turn deadly in a matter of hours.\n\nMeningitis B was the strain behind all college meningococcal disease outbreaks over the past eight years. One study using surveillance data between 2015 and 2017 that was published in May found that the incidence rate of meningitis B among college students who most likely live in close quarters was five times higher than those of similar age not attending college.\n\nThere are about 20 cases of meningitis B among college students annually, says Sarah Mbaeyi, a pediatrician who studies meningococcal disease for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. She says about 12 percent of meningitis B cases result in death, and another 10 to 20 percent result in significant long-term conditions, such as loss of limbs or hearing or cognitive deficits. (There were 134 total cases in 2017, according to the CDC\u2019s latest surveillance report.)\n\nThe pediatrician for Bibl\u2019s son probably didn\u2019t mention meningitis B because protection against the infection is considered optional. The advisory committee that guides vaccination policies at the CDC has said that distribution of the meningitis B vaccine should be based on \u201cshared clinical decision-making.\u201d\n\nIn other words, unless a teen has compromised immunity, an abnormal spleen condition or is a college student in the middle of an campus outbreak, it\u2019s up to individual doctors to decide whether to broach the topic.\n\n\n\nJoseph Clouse, 18, wanted to be a firefighter. He died in February of the illness that affects the lining of the brain and spinal cord. (Pearl Biddle)\n\n\u201cWhile it is not recommended universally for everyone, we as pediatricians should be bringing it up with all young adults and their families,\u201d says Henry Bernstein, a pediatrician at Northwell Health in New Hyde Park, New York and former member of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Infectious Diseases. The parties would then decide together whether it was appropriate to get the vaccine, he added.\n\nIf the vaccine is given \u2014 only 17 percent of 17-year-olds had been immunized against meningitis B vaccine in 2018 \u2014 the CDC recommends it for individuals ages 16 through 23, with a preferred age of 16 through 18 years. (For those with certain health issues that places them at increased risk, the recommendation is at 10 years or older.)\n\nYet some critics say the policy is confusing for providers and parents because whether a doctor brings it up is arbitrary. \u201cIn the medical community, it\u2019s interpreted more as a looser recommendation. It\u2019s a \u2018maybe\u2019 vaccine, so providers are less likely to talk about it,\u201d says Lucila Marquez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children\u2019s Hospital in Houston.\n\nOne 2016 survey of 660 health-care providers found that only 51 percent of pediatricians and 31 percent of family physicians \u201calways or often\u201d discussed the meningitis B vaccine. The authors of the research, which was published in September, concluded: \u201cPrimary care physicians have significant gaps in knowledge about meningitis B disease and meningitis B vaccine.\u201d\n\nAlthough those findings were based on a 2016 survey shortly after the CDC first suggested doctors talk about meningitis B with patients and parents about the availability of two vaccines, lead author Allison Kempe says the same dynamics that might discourage doctors to initiate a conversation are still at work. Those include a shortage of time to talk about an optional vaccine for a relatively rare disease.\n\n\u201cThe problem on the provider side is that there are so many required vaccines to discuss and that it\u2019s understandable that a vaccine that\u2019s not routinely recommended would get overlooked or be considered a lower priority,\u201d says Kempe, director of the Adult and Child Center for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science at the University of Colorado Denver.\n\nShe says that providers might use up their valuable visit minutes going over the human papilloma virus vaccine, general health topics like safe sex or obesity or reassuring patients about the safety of vaccines.\n\nColleges, meanwhile, are divided on whether the meningitis B vaccine should be required for enrollment. Only 42 colleges or universities require it of new students, according to the Meningitis B Action Project. More than 200 schools recommend it.\n\nDespite the seriousness of meningitis B, and the speed with which it can kill, public health officials say that it doesn\u2019t warrant being treated as a widespread health threat. \u201cThe incidence of disease is low,\u201d says Mbaeyi, adding that incidence rates of meningitis B have fallen since 1995. (The CDC says the reasons aren\u2019t clear but include reduced rates of smoking, which is a risk factor for meningococcal disease.)\n\n\u201cThere are still questions that remain to be answered, such as the effectiveness of the vaccines and how long immunity lasts. The goal of the current recommendation is to make it an option,\u201d Mbaeyi says. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough evidence to suggest it should be given to all adolescents routinely.\u201d\n\nData shows that both vaccines currently on the market \u2014 \u00adBexsero, given in two doses a month apart, and Trumenba, which is administered twice six months apart \u2014 provide protection for 24 to 48 months after vaccination, according to the CDC.\n\nBut worries that their effectiveness wanes within a couple years prompted the CDC\u2019s immunization advisory board to recently recommend a booster shot for previously vaccinated individuals in the event of an outbreak.\n\nThere is also the issue of price for an uncommon disease. The two-dose vaccine series costs more than $300, more for a booster, and is usually covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cWhen you start to make a \u00adcost-benefit analysis from a public policy perspective for a rare disease, it gets complicated,\u201d Marquez says. \u201cBut on an individual level, if you can get protection from a rare but very serious disease, then why wouldn\u2019t you get it? It seems like a no-brainer.\u201d\n\nYet for parents like Teresa and Victor Mattison, of Mauldin, S.C., who lost their 20-year-old daughter, Victoria, in May, they\u2019re devastated that they never got the option to consider the meningitis B vaccine. \u201cIn 2017, when she got the main meningitis vaccine prior to college, we thought we were in the clear. There was no discussion about meningitis B,\u201d Victor says.\n\nVictoria Mattison had just finished her sophomore year at Clemson University and was hanging out at her mother\u2019s dance studio when she complained about ankle pain and severe body aches. Doctors blamed meningitis B and six days later, took her off life support.\n\n\u201cThere are no words for this hurt. This was an athletic, healthy volleyball player who got sick out of the blue,\u201d Teresa says. \u201cThe pediatricians had a responsibility to share this information and let the parents and caregiver make the decision about getting the vaccination.\u201d\n\nVaccination advocate Patti Wukovits started the Kimberly Coffey Foundation in honor of her daughter, who died of meningitis B at age 17 in 2012 in East Islip, N.Y. Wukovits says parents need to ask their children\u2019s doctors specifically about meningitis B and not assume it\u2019s covered as part of the main vaccination their children routinely receive.\n\n\u201cKim came home from school one afternoon with body aches and a fever of 101. By the next morning, she was in multiorgan failure and went into cardiac arrest,\u201d Wukovits says. Kim was placed on a ventilator and died a few days later.\n\n\u201cParents need to know there\u2019s an additional meningitis B vaccine and not assume their doctor will tell them about,\u201d says Wukovits, a nurse from Massapequa Park, N.Y. \u201cThis is 2019. We\u2019ve had a vaccine available for the last five years and we shouldn\u2019t be losing any more children.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nHow a small college survived an outbreak of meningitis\n\nThe vaccines your child needs before heading to college\n\n\u2018This terrible disease\u2019: Ovarian cancer is deadly, but new tests, treatments start to emerge", "description": "CDC guidelines leave it up to physicians to talk about the optional vaccine.
