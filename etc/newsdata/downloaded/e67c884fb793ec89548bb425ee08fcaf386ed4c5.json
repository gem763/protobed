That\u2019s how the play worked in practice during the week. Now, early in Sunday\u2019s first quarter, the running back corner route was being brought into a game.\n\nOnly problem was the Oakland Raiders had the corner covered. When Jones broke his route outside, the way he was instructed, Rodgers didn\u2019t have a throwing window.\n\nSo the Green Bay Packers quarterback improvised.\n\n\u201cI felt like to throw it within the boundary would\u2019ve been too flat,\u201d Rodgers explained, \u201cand a guy was on him. So I just tried to put it up.\u201d\n\nRodgers put it toward his running back\u2019s inside shoulder. He dropped it over Raiders linebacker Nicholas Morrow\u2019s head, yet still inside cornerback Gareon Conley, a perfect throw that, no, coach Matt LaFleur didn\u2019t script.\n\nWhen Jones caught Sunday afternoon\u2019s opening touchdown pass, making a remarkable adjustment and securing the football as he fell to the field, it seemed like something special might be brewing. Jones, running wide open through the Detroit Lions secondary, dropped a sure touchdown six days earlier. The degree of difficulty here was infinitely higher.\n\nEven still, nobody could have guessed just how special the Packers\u2019 two-time MVP quarterback\u2019s day would become.\n\nRodgers accounted for as many touchdowns as he had incompletions during the Packers\u2019 42-24 rout of the Raiders, a win that improved their record to 6-1 and positioned them firmly in the NFC\u2019s early conversation for home-field advantage. He had a season-high 429 passing yards, just the ninth time in his career he has exceeded 400 in a game. His five touchdown passes \u2014 he added a 3-yard rushing touchdown \u2014 to five different receivers was one behind his career high, and only the fifth time he has done that in his career.\n\nThen, there\u2019s this: Rodgers\u2019 158.3 rating, the maximum value a quarterback can achieve, was the first time in Packers history a quarterback has had a perfect mark in a single game. Rodgers broke his own single-game franchise record of 155.4, which he set at the Cleveland Browns in 2009.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s some legendary stuff,\u201d outside linebacker Za\u2019Darius Smith said.\n\nWhat does a perfect passer rating look like in the box score? How about a 25-for-31 completion clip, 13.8 yards per pass, and six total touchdowns. Rodgers became only the second quarterback in NFL history to have at least 400 passing yards, five passing touchdowns, a rushing touchdown and no interceptions in a single game, joining former Washington Redskins quarterback Mark Rypien.\n\nThe afternoon might have started imperfectly, with Rodgers forced to make an adjustment on his first touchdown throw. By day\u2019s end, it was as close to perfection as any quarterback has reached in NFL history.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t understand how they put that rating together,\u201d Rodgers said, smirking and perhaps, considering his football intelligence, presenting a little humility, \u201cbut it does sound pretty good.\u201d\n\nIt looked even better. Looked vintage. Rodgers threw deep Sunday, completing a 59-yard bomb to Marquez Valdes-Scantling. That stood as the Packers\u2019 longest play of the season until Valdes-Scantling capped his afternoon with a 74-yard touchdown catch and run in the fourth quarter. Rodgers hit almost everything underneath, with LaFleur\u2019s crossing patterns frequently leading to wide-open receivers.\n\nIt looked like everything the Packers hoped their offense would be once quarterback and head coach found their rhythm.\n\n\u201cI feel like this has been coming,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI really do. I feel like we\u2019ve been building, and I\u2019ve been feeling a lot more comfortable, and Matt\u2019s been feeling more comfortable with him calling it for me and feeling when I\u2019m in that rhythm, and when to be aggressive and when to pull back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019ve been at our best over the years, it\u2019s being aggressive and knowing when to dial it back. We had even some more shots called that we called off or dialed back because of the look. We kept dialing them up. I thought the plan was really good.\u201d\n\nThat Rodgers did it without top receiver Davante Adams might be the most impressive part.\n\nThe Packers have won each of their three games without the Pro Bowl receiver, two of those wins accounting for their two highest point totals of the season. Rodgers assured the Packers are missing Adams\u2019 presence. \u201cI can promise you,\u201d the quarterback said, \u201cwe need him and we\u2019re a better offense with 17 on the field.\u201d Still, by spreading the wealth and relying on a consistent run game, Rodgers has found something resembling MVP form.\n\nWithout Adams, Rodgers\u2019 top receiver is a former fifth-round pick (Valdes-Scantling). Rounding out his top four Sunday were a trio of undrafted receivers (Geronimo Allison, Jake Kumerow, Allen Lazard). A great quarterback is supposed to elevate those around him. Suffice to say, Rodgers has elevated the offense around him.\n\n\u201cI think he can be in that (MVP) talk pretty much every year,\u201d right tackle Bryan Bulaga said. \u201cEven look at the years he\u2019s not in it. I mean, you see what happens. That\u2019s just the type of talent he is. Aaron Rodgers is still one of the best quarterbacks to ever play, and to still play right now.\n\n\u201cSo, yeah, I mean, I don\u2019t know who puts people in those discussions, but I don\u2019t see a reason why he shouldn\u2019t be. We\u2019re 6-1, and not a lot of people thought we were going to be at this stage of the season what we are.\u201d\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
