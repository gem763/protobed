Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney\u2019s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds.\n\nRomney aides say he's always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump\u2019s efforts to ostracize him. Yet the senator\u2019s recent efforts underscore his insistence on not receding from a Republican Party now dominated by Trump. At 72 and in the twilight of his political career, Romney cares little about what the president has to say about him, his friends say, and is determined to take a stand for mainstream Republicans who've been increasingly marginalized since Trump took office.\n\n\"I know plenty of my candidates would love Romney's fundraising help \u2014 he\u2019s got a huge donor network, regardless of the Twitter sentiment of the day,\" said Will Ritter, a top aide on Romney's 2018 Senate campaign, referring to Trump's attacks.\n\nThe senator is stepping up after Trump just unleashed a withering assault on the 2012 GOP nominee over his refusal to rule out supporting impeachment. Over the weekend, Trump called the Utah senator a \u201cpompous \u2018ass,\u2019\u201d who is \u201cso bad for Rs.\u201d The president added that Romney was \u201cplaying right into the hands\u201d of Democrats and tweeted out a video of him losing the 2012 election.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies are piling on. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani said Romney was \u201cbitter about Donald Trump\u201d winning the White House. Conservative radio show host Rush Limbaugh told listeners that Romney is determined to \u201cget rid of Trump.\u201d And Donald Trump Jr. said that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is \u201cmuch tougher than Mittens.\u201d\n\nThe senator further infuriated the Trump team when he called the president\u2019s appeal to China to investigate Joe Biden \u201cwrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nRomney is shrugging it all off. On Thursday evening, he hosted a fundraiser for the Utah Republican Party, an organization that's been plagued by financial and organizational troubles. Within the state\u2019s political circles, the event was considered particularly noteworthy because conservatives formerly involved in the state GOP apparatus vocally opposed Romney\u2019s 2018 Senate bid.\n\nRomney\u2019s presence at the Salt Lake City dinner, held at the home of real estate executive Scott Keller, is designed to provide encouragement to mainstream Republicans who\u2019ve long felt alienated from the state party. The Utah GOP is trying to rebuild itself following midterm elections that saw Republicans lose a congressional seat and a half-dozen state legislative seats.\n\n\u201cHaving someone as well-known as Mitt Romney publicly supporting the Utah Republican Party\u2019s fundraising efforts effectively sends a signal to former donors, the business community, and the entire Utah political establishment that \u2018the water is warm,\u2019 so to speak, and it\u2019s safe to jump back in,\u201d said state GOP Chairman Derek Brown.\n\nAfter he became chairman earlier this year, Brown said, Romney \u201cmade it very clear to me that he was willing to play an active role in supporting the party.\u201d\n\nSo far this year, Romney has funneled cash to roughly a dozen county GOP organizations.\n\nBut most of his donations in 2019 have been directed to his Senate colleagues. After taking office in January, he gave the maximum contribution of $5,600 to each Republican incumbent up for reelection in 2020 \u2014 an unusual, if not unprecedented, gesture for a freshman senator.\n\nThis spring, he held a high-dollar fundraiser in Florida for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Over the summer, he was a special guest at an event for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.", "description": "President Donald Trump wants to sideline Mitt Romney \u2014 but the Utah senator isn\u2019t having it.
