It should be noted that hosts from both of FNC rivals praised Smith upon hearing of his quick exit on Friday.\n\nView photos\n\nInside the 6th Avenue HQ of Fox News, there was disappointment at the Kramer Talent repped Smith heading for the door. There is also a presumption among many that the anchor was caught in a verbal vice from Trump that was straining relations for executives with the White House and other big names at the once Fair and Balanced network. A situation in which Smith was the sacrificial lamb, even if it was eventually by his own choice.\n\n\u201cYou can say a lot of things about Roger Ailes, but this wouldn\u2019t have happened if he were still alive and running things at Fox,\u201d a well-placed source at the Rupert Murdoch-owned cabler newser told Deadline after Smith\u2019s departure this afternoon. \u201cRoger took care of his people from the outside, protected them. He would have told Trump to back off.\u201d\n\nAnother source noted that current FNC CEO Suzanne Scott seemed to do little to quell the on-air slaps that primetimers Tucker Carlson and Trump de facto Secretary of Media Sean Hannity took at the afternoon anchor. \u201cIt was just embarrassing to see and I feel like the bullies won.\u201d\n\nOthers inside FNC say nostalgia can be deceiving and that Smith has actually been on the back foot since Ailes pulled him out of a high profile primetime slot in 2013 and moved things around to make room for Meghan Kelly. The Kelly File host left FNC in early 2017 for a what was a short but lucrative stint on NBC that officially ended early this year.\n\n\u201cWhile this day is especially challenging for both of us who have worked alongside him for 23 years, we respect his decision and are deeply grateful for his immense contributions to the entire network,\u201d said a memo that CEO Scott and News boss Jay Wallace sent out to staffers Friday after Smith made his move to leave public (Read the full memo below).\n\n\u201cHis integrity and outstanding reporting from the field helped put FOX News on the map,\u201d Scott and Wallace added on the anchor who had been there at FNC from the very beginning. \u201cThere is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair or elation through his masterful blending of words and experience,\u201d the cabler leading duo asserted. \u201cWe are incredibly proud of the signature reporting and anchoring style he honed here, along with everything he accomplished during his monumental 23-year tenure.\u201d\n\nIn that vein, Hannity was also full of nothing but good old praise for Smith and his future today:\n\nI\u2019ve always said there is nobody better at breaking news than Shep Smith. He has always done great things and I know he will continue to do so. Looking forward to seeing Shep crush it in whatever he does next. \u2014 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 11, 2019\n\nThe same could not be said of Donald Trump.\n\nHaving repeatedly railed against Smith for not marching lock step with his administration and its version of events and fact, Trump today took a few swipes at the departing 23-year Fox News veteran\n\n\u201cIs he leaving because of bad ratings?\u201d Trump ribbed reporters Friday on the South Lawn of the White House as Marine One prepared to take off for a rally in Lake Charles, LA. \u201cHe had terrible ratings,\u201d Trump added of Smith. \u201cHe had the worst ratings on Fox.\u201d", "description": "Donald Trump may be rubbing salt into the wound of Shepard Smith suddenly exiting Fox News Channel today, but the anchor could be back soon-ish to shine a spotlight of truth on the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host. \"The decision to leave was Shep's and his alone,\u201d said Smith\u2019s PR representative", "authors": ["Dominic Patten"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bf_SFzbeh7L3.xL.H565lw--~B/aD01NjM7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/deadline.com/b598eadcca45405f8b5c055fb625733c", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
