(Photo: Twitter)\n\nA simple note written by a flight attendant to a deaf teen, who was on her first flight alone, has garnered attention online after the passenger's mother shared it on Twitter. Although it may have seemed like a simple gesture, the teenager says that it helped ease her nerves, and it's a letter she will \"cherish.\"\n\nAshley Ober, of Hagerstown, Maryland, was born deaf, but as a 16-year-old teen, she wanted to show that she could be independent. While her mom, Loretta Ober, wanted to help her, Ashley insisted she was capable of taking the Endeavor Air, a subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, July flight from Baltimore to Rochester on her own.\n\nHowever, she was understandably nervous, especially considering she had a connecting flight at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\n\u201cI [felt] nervous because \u2026 what if I miss my flight or I don\u2019t know where to go if I transfer,\u201d Ashley told WJLA through an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter. \u201cI mean JFK is such a big airport, so I didn\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\n\nLoretta dropped her daughter off at the Baltimore/Washington International Airport and waited anxiously outside.\n\n\u201cI was waiting, watching my phone and I was thinking should I pull off, should I wait? And then the light popped up on my phone,\u201d Loretta said.\n\nIt was a text from Ashley, which included a note written to her by a flight attendant, which Loretta shared on Twitter.\n\nMy daughter who is Deaf took a flight by herself ! The attendant handed her this note on the plane ! Delta makes it amazing! @Delta pic.twitter.com/KQGVBq9uVC \u2014 bostonober (@oberlynn13) July 6, 2019\n\nThe note itself was simple; the flight attendant, Janna, explained to Ashley the buttons at her seat, how she could signal Janna for help, and what to do in case of an emergency. To Ashley, it was an incredible act of kindness, and it left her feeling calm and included.\n\n\u201cDeaf people can do anything,\u201d Ashley told WJLA. \u201cCommunication is most important. Communication access is most important, to try to make any effort for deaf people, to make them comfortable instead of making them feel afraid.\u201d\n\nAshley says she still has the note.\n\n\u201cI still have it. I\u2019m going to cherish that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are extremely proud of the thoughtful approach this Endeavor Air flight attendant took to make the customer feel welcome. Our goal is to make the world a more inclusive place, ensuring travel is easy for all people,\" a Delta spokesperson told the station.\n\nThe spokesperson added that in the next few months, Delta would give flight attendants and gate agents who can sign a uniform language bar which would state they can speak ASL or another sign language.\n\n\u201cWith this improvement, customers and qualified employees will immediately be able to visually recognize when they hold sign language as a common connection,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate customers sharing their Delta moments with us, and applaud Janna\u2019s thoughtfulness to help assist this first-time solo flyer,\u201d Delta said in a statement to Yahoo Lifestyle.\n\nLoretta Ober did not immediately respond to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s requests for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A deaf 16-year-old, traveling for the first time alone, received a kind note from a flight attendant that helped ease her worries.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/PZ4uTss_ef11y0SPXnJXMw--~B/aD01OTg7dz04ODQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/92f9b8b0-db1b-11e9-a8af-e1a7b36ec4c9", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
