Their hard-fought comeback to tie the two-game series fell short, or so it seemed.\n\nBut in a dramatic plot-twist, the umpires awarded Canada a penalty stroke after an agonizing video review \u2013 they deemed Canada's Jamie Wallace was taken down in the scoring zone.\n\nCaptain Scott Tupper, playing in his 307th game for the program, stepped up under immense pressure with a chance to tie the two game-series at 6-6 and force a shootout. He delivered like he has so many times in his career.\n\nWATCH | Canada defeats Ireland to book Olympic spot:\n\nCanada wins their two-game aggregate series with Ireland in a shootout on home soil. 1:27\n\nThe goal sent the capacity crowd of more than 2,000 people into a frenzy and gave the Canadians new life \u2013 a five-player shootout awaited.\n\nAnd for the second time Sunday afternoon it looked as though Canada's Olympic dreams were over. Ireland bolted out to a 3-1 lead in the shootout. Canada needed to score on their last two shots and have goalkeeper David Carter stop Ireland's last two shooters\u2014The Red Caribou delivered on both counts.\n\nCaptain Scott Tupper forced the shootout when he scored on a penalty stroke with no time left on the clock. (@FieldHockeyCan/Twitter)\n\nThe drama had ratcheted to a different level as the game turned to sudden death shots. The Irish scored first. Canada tied it again. On the seventh shooter the game was decided. After Ireland missed, the stage was set for Adam Froese to clinch an Olympic spot for Canada.\n\nFroese danced around the circle, the crowd held their breath, Froese stickhandling the ball wildly before calmly striking it into the back of the net. He threw his stick in the air. The Canadian team blasted toward him. The crowd erupted in a red and white celebration. Canada found their way to the Olympics in the most improbable fashion.\n\n\"It's unbelievable. No real words for it. It's amazing,\" Tupper said, tears in his eyes. \"Obviously, we weren't in the best spot after yesterday. We were feeling pretty down. You never know what's going to happen. For the guys to perform in the shootout is unbelievable. This is surreal.\"\n\nAdam Froese was mobbed by teammates after his goal made the shootout score 5-4. (Yan Huckendubler)\n\nCanada lost Game 1 on Saturday 5-3 to the Irish. Their 3-1 victory in Game 2 forced the shootout.\n\nThe victory was reminiscent of Canada's qualifying game four years ago to earn a spot at the Games in Rio. They were also down 3-1 in the shootout to New Zealand and found a way back. Carter was also in the net for that game \u2013 he's 7-0 in shootouts for Canada.\n\n\"We just love the pressure. I love facing guys one-on-one,\" he said. \"That's the first time I've done that, just come in for the shootout. Everyone had my back. The crowd support was incredible.\"\n\nAntoni Kindler was the goalkeeper for Canada throughout the game and made a scintillating save late to keep their hopes alive. Then shootout specialist Carter took over.\n\n\"Every time we go into a shootout we're pretty confident we can come out on top,\" Carter said\n\nHaving dropped Saturday's series-opener 5-3, Canada pressed from the opening whistle. (Yan Huckendubler)\n\nCelebration to remember\n\nAfter the victory the Canadian players jumped up and down in the middle of the field, hugging each other. Fans screamed and cheered as the players continued to celebrate.\n\nThen the team made their way around the field, saluting the hometown crowd and hugging family and friends along the way. Fans drove their cars by the stadium honking their horns. Many in the program called this two-game series the most important two matches ever on Canadian soil and they didn't disappoint.\n\n\"I might cry,\" said Froese. \"Honestly it couldn't have been a better place to do this. Family. Friends. It's been a long four years. We've worked hard.\"\n\n'Beautiful day'\n\nThe party spilled into the beer gardens alongside Rutledge Field. Players were still wearing their uniforms more than an hour after the end of the game, drinking beer and chanting with Canadian supporters.\n\n\"It's just a beautiful day in West Van,\" Carter said. \"We're going back to the Olympics.\"\n\nThe Olympic berth means Field Hockey Canada is going to back-to-back Games for only the second time in the program's history \u2013 the only other time they've done so came in 1984 and 1988.\n\nFor coach Paul Bundy it means putting their sometimes-overlooked sport in Canada on the map.\n\n\"To qualify for the Olympics grows our game. It brings us together as a team,\" he said. \"There are good things ahead to happen for field hockey in Canada.\"\n\nBundy couldn't be prouder of the way his team fought in Sunday's game despite seeming to have lost it all.\n\n\"It's just an amazing way to qualify for the Olympics,\" Bundy said. \"We're not a very big sport in Canada but we have a small community who support us. Whoever says our game is boring they should watch this.\"\n\nIt's not the way the coach or any Canadian player imagined qualifying for the Olympics but on a brilliantly sunny Sunday in late October in West Vancouver the Red Caribou provided a sporting memory in Canada to last a lifetime.", "description": "Captain Scott Tupper, playing in his 307th\u00a0game for the program, stepped up under immense pressure with a chance to tie the two game-series at 6-6 and force a shootout.
