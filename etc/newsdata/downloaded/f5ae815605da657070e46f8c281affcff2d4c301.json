Guenther said the team didn\u2019t know he was one wrong move away from getting the major ban.\n\nNFL UPHOLDS OAKLAND RAIDERS LINEBACKER VONTAZE BURFICT'S SEASON-LONG SUSPENSION\n\n\u201cI think it was a witch hunt from the beginning, quite honestly,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cSomebody in the league didn't want him playing football and they got what they wanted.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cDoes it make any sense to sign a guy that after one infraction, he's going to get thrown out of the league for a year? No, it doesn't. So, I think it's very unfair. It's unfair to our team. It's unfair to Vontaze.\u201d\n\nGuenther took exception to the unprecedented suspension and was shocked when NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan asserted in his letter to Burfict that the linebacker was told \u201cfuture violations would result in escalated accountability measures.\u201d\n\nVONTAZE BURFICT BEING SINGLED OUT BY NFL WITH SEASON-LONG SUSPENSION, RAIDERS LINEBACKER'S AGENT SAYS\n\n\u201cThere's no standard, and that's the issue,\u201d Guenther said. \u201cThere's nothing [that says], \u2018Hey, next time you do this, you're gone for the year. Maybe your career.\u2019 I think that's unfair. You can warn a guy, but put that in writing -- the next time this happens, you're done. ... It's unfair to all the players around the league to not know.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAnd now, they've opened a whole can of worms, as far as the next guy who's going to do it. So, we've got to make sure, if we're going to do it to this one guy, this one guy driving 38 mph in a 30 mph zone for the cop looking for one guy doing it, that all the players are held to the same standard. To me, that's where I have the issue.\u201d\n\nBurfict received the suspension after laying a hit on Indianapolis Colts tight end Jack Doyle. His appeal of the suspension was upheld.\n\nThe veteran has racked up more than $4 million in fines and has been suspended 10 times due to the apparent headhunting on the field. The penalties came when he was with the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe Raiders signed Burfict to a one-year, $2 million contract in the offseason.
