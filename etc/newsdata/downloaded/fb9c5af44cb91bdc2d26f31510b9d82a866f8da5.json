The Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles and drone attacks on Saudi cities during the conflict.\n\nThe kingdom has in recent weeks increased its military presence in southern Yemen, bringing in additional troops, armoured vehicles, tanks and other military equipment.\n\nIt took control of Aden earlier this month after the UAE withdrew some of its forces from the city.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, William Lawrence, professor at the George Washington University's Eliott School of International Affairs, warned there might be more violence in the near future despite the initial deal.\n\n\"It's not finalised yet and the main way to see it there are spoilers on all sides, including the two sides signing it,\" he said.", "description": "Car bomb found near the residences of Interior Minister Ahmed Al-Maisari Transport Minister Saleh Al-Jabwani.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/29/e2951ff6e6fa4c8c87e054c48acfa19b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
