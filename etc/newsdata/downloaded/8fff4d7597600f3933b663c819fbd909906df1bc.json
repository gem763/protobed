REUTERS/Henry Romero/File Photo\n\nJustice Eduardo Medina Mora, 62, was appointed under prior President Enrique Pena Nieto in 2015, and, according to local media, was set to serve until 2030.\n\nUnder the last administration he also was ambassador to the United States, and under prior President Felipe Calderon, was attorney general.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accepted Medina Mora\u2019s request to leave his post and would send it to the Senate for final approval, his office said, but did not provide further details.\n\nMedina Mora could not be reached for comment.\n\nLopez Obrador told reporters in June that the financial intelligence unit, which probes money laundering and other financial crimes, had received information on Medina Mora from U.S. authorities.\n\nHe declined to state whether an investigation was underway.\n\nFollowing Lopez Obrador\u2019s June comments, the financial intelligence chief said his office had been asked by the Senate to analyze the financial transfers pertaining to a Justice, without naming the person.\n\nThe financial intelligence unit declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nLopez Obrador, a veteran leftist who unseated Pena Nieto\u2019s decades-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) when he took office in December, has vowed to root out Mexico\u2019s entrenched corruption, starting from the top.\n\nMedina Mora\u2019s exit, which leaves 10 other justices in the court, was unusual, said Ricardo Monreal, Senate leader of the president\u2019s leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).\n\n\u201cI really lament his decision, but he\u2019ll have his own story and truth to tell,\u201d Monreal told reporters.", "description": "A Mexican Supreme Court Justice has resigned, the president's office said on Thursday, after the judge faced questions about a possible probe by Mexico's financial intelligence unit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436872697&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9305T", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
