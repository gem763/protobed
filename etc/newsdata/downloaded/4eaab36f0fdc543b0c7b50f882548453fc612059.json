Twitter/@narendramodi\n\nIndian and Malaysian social media users have not been very happy with each other of late, with people on both sides calling for their fellow countrymen to either #BoycottMalaysia or #BoycottIndia.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the big shots at the government level are keen to take part in the war of words. According to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, his Indian counterpart has not expressed any displeasure with him or Malaysians.\n\n\u201cSo far, I\u2019ve not received any feedback. I had told (Prime Minister of India) Narendra Modi to contact me if he is unhappy or dissatisfied,\u201d Mahathir was quoted by New Straits Times (NST) as saying at the Parliament lobby on Tuesday (Oct 8).\n\nThe brouhaha online first started when Mahathir addressed the Jammu and Kashmir issue in a United Nations General Assembly speech on September 27.\n\nHe later repeated these comments on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThe helplessness of the world in stopping atrocities inflicted on the Rohingyas in Myanmar had reduced the regard for the resolution of the UN. Now, despite UN resolution on Jammu and Kashmir, the country has been invaded and occupied,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere may be reasons for this action but it is still wrong. The problem must be solved by peaceful means. India should work with Pakistan to resolve this problem. Ignoring the UN would lead to other forms of disregard for the UN and the Rule of Law.\n\nAfter the speech, Indian Twitter users expressed outrage at Mahathir\u2019s comments, and called for a boycott on all things Malaysian.\n\nAfter this statement\u2026 My all dear brothers and sisters from my country INDIA..

If it isn\u2019t urgent, don\u2019t travel there. Avoid trade.

We don\u2019t care. \u2014 \u30a2\u30de\u30eb (@amarekun) September 30, 2019\n\nAccording to NST, the Malaysian premier defended his remarks on Tuesday, saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t give criticism to side with anyone, but we call for both parties to discuss, use arbitration or go to the court of law, not to resort to violence.\u201d\n\nNews website The Star quoted Mahathir as saying that he had made the same remarks to India\u2019s PM Modi when they met in Russia in September.\n\n\u201cMy speech (at the UN general assembly) is a follow-up, where I said that we don\u2019t want to see any violence or disputes between countries. That\u2019s all we said,\u201d The Star quoted him as saying.\n\nHowever, Mahathir also acknowledged there were were people who were unhappy \u201cwith the mild criticisms of India\u201d.\n\nEarlier on the same day, Malaysia\u2019s Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said the #BoycottMalaysia trend was \u201cslowly dying off\u201d, Free Malaysia Today reported.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s government \u201cwants to be friends and trade with all countries except Israel\u201d, he added.\n\nAccording to Saifuddin, India is Malaysia\u2019s 10th largest trading partner, with trade expected to reach up to US$15 billion.", "description": "Business Insider - Some people are even calling for a boycott of AirAsia..
