And then we\u2019re looking at some website that had \u201cFan Casting of Game of Thrones.\u201d\n\n\u2018A lot of it was kinda knuckleheaded, but some of it was really smart. And there was one person, or maybe a few people, who said, \u201cOh, it should be this guy Jason Momoa.\u201d\u2019\n\nUm, yay?\n\nTo add another nail to the notorious coffin, there were nothing fans could have done about the rise and downfall of the show\u2019s storyline no matter what.\n\nWhen asked whether they even cared to check the feedback from fans, Dan said: \u2018We really did not.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Because he didn\u2019t see the value of considering other people\u2019s reactions and Dave just didn\u2019t want to be upset.\n\nThe moral of the story seems to be \u2018fake it until you make it\u2019 but in their defence, they did make Game of Thrones one of the biggest shows of all time.\n\nWe don\u2019t know about you, but we need to sit down after that rollercoaster of confusion.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
