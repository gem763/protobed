The White House did not immediately respond to questions about whether they had sought to limit Hill\u2019s testimony.\n\nMore: What's ahead this week in the impeachment inquiry? A deadline for Rudy Giuliani, more Capitol Hill meetings\n\nHill was expected to face questions about the deepening scandal related to Trump urging that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate his political rival, Joe Biden, while withholding military aid from that country.\n\nRepublicans have argued that Democrats are conducting impeachment behind closed doors and should release transcripts of depositions with Hill and others.\n\n\u201cThe tragedy here and the crime here is that the American people don\u2019t get to see what\u2019s going on in these sessions,\u201d said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the top Republican on the Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nBut the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that hearing from witnesses behind closed doors prevents others from knowing what was said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests,\u201d Schiff said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., tried to attend the deposition as a member of the Judiciary Committee. But Schiff and the House parliamentarian ruled that he couldn't attend because he wasn't a member of the three committees that scheduled the session.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over impeachment,\u201d Gaetz told reporters after being asked to leave. \u201cIf Adam Schiff and House Democrats were so proud of their work, they would be willing to show it.\u201d\n\nHill left her post just before Trump's July call with Zelensky in which he pressed for the investigation, but NBC and CNN report she was was aware of the efforts by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, to find dirt on Biden in Ukraine.\n\nNBC reported that Hill plans to tell congressional panels leading the impeachment effort that Giuliani and Gordon Sondland, the European Union ambassador who has been subpoenaed to appear before the panels, led a shadow policy on Ukraine that went around normal procedures and side-stepped the National Security Council.\n\nAfter listing to Hill for hours behind closed doors, Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said each of the officials being questioned by the panels are offering pieces of a wider picture that is helping put together different aspects of the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"All of these witnesses are filling in the picture of what was taking place because the famous \u2014 infamous July 25 telephone call was not some kind of one-off \u2014 it was the culmination of a continuing campaign by Rudy Giulian and his henchmen,\" he said, calling the Giuliani's work a \"shadow\" foreign policy campaign that aimed to \"shakedown\" the Ukrainian government.\n\nBefore helping guide the Trump administration on Russia and Euroasia policy, Hill was a Brookings Institution scholar, a frequent Putin critic and authored multiple books on Russia and Vladimir Putin, including \"Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,\" which criticized the Russian president's ruling of the country. She holds master's degrees in Soviet studies, along with Russian and modern history, according to her Brookings Institution biography.", "description": "Fiona Hill, President Donald Trump's former Russia adviser, testified Monday before Congress as part of the House's impeachment inquiry examining Ukraine.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Bart Jansen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5nfpR.s14De4Gw6pGZlvnQ--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/de69d117-9378-4693-8d8f-7ee7cecdc2d4/149b5776-b622-5da5-98ee-f9699815eb75/data_3_0.jpg?s=476fec0daa236ac28def7e03285ea764&c=b080312c67ee28d629839a8ff62df692&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
