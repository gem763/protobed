Architect Hua Li, who has completed several rural projects over the past decade, embedded a modern concrete-and-steel structure between the surviving rammed-earth walls.\n\nHowever, he has kept the external appearance of the edifice in line with the vernacular architecture and retained a section of the ruined walls to form an entrance yard.\n\nThe bookstore stocks around 7,500 titles on such topics as architecture, photography, art, film and design, as well as classics of the humanities and social sciences.", "description": "A bookstore chain has opened its fourth rural branch matching the vernacular of the local architecture in a bid to revive grassroots culture, Fang Aiqing reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/24/5db1029ca310cf3e97a2b231.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
