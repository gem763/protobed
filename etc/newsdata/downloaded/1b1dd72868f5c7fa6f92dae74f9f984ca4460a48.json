However, EU countries have since reverted to the former process under which every state nominates one Commissioner.\n\nBoris Johnson has not proposed any names to replace the UK\u2019s outgoing Commission member, Sir Julian King \u2013 who was sent to Brussels in the wake of the 2016 referendum.\n\nIf the UK leaves the EU on January 31 or earlier, and the UK nominates a candidate \u2013 the tenure of Sir Julian's replacement might end up being one of the most short-lived for a top EU job.\n\nRead more:\n\nEU leaders agree Brexit extension until January 31, 2020\n\nWhat are this week's key Brexit decisions? | Euronews Answers\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now \u2013 and how did we get here?", "description": "Brussels expects a British nominee for the Commission under a Brexit extension.
