His staff initially said two stents were inserted for a blocked artery in his heart. Two days later, they revealed he had a heart attack.\n\nSanders told NBC it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest his staff hadn\u2019t been forthright about his condition. He said he was still talking to doctors and trying to understand what was going on.\n\nThe focus on Sanders\u2019 health comes as age plays a significant role in the 2020 presidential campaign. Should he win the Democratic presidential nomination, he would be the oldest person ever elected. So would his 76-year-old Democratic rival Joe Biden.\n\nSanders\u2019 apparent reversal is at odds with one of his national co-chairs Nina Turner, who said in a Tuesday interview that the campaign was examining where and how to make changes to reflect concerns about the senator\u2019s health.\n\nSanders has been among the most aggressive campaigners in the Democratic race, sometimes making multiple campaign appearances each day on multiday campaign swings through key states across America.\n\nWhile Sanders had campaign appearances scheduled for the coming days, Sanders\u2019 wife, Jane O\u2019Meara Sanders, said Wednesday that he would stay in Vermont until next week\u2019s debate.", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said Wednesday that he \u201cmisspoke\u201d when he told reporters he may slow his frenetic campaigning pace after a...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT006_bernie_ZG_20191009180242.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
