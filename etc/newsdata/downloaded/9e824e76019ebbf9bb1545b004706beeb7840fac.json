Its clean, geometric lines and sun-drenched interiors are a far cry from the typical painted stucco and half-timbered houses that surround it in the hamlet of Burcot.\n\n\n\nMore: Brexit Fracas Puts Off U.K. House Sellers in September\n\nSam Selencky of architects Selencky Parsons designed the atypical country home, which spans 5,000 square feet across three floors, including a penthouse master suite with its own outdoor terrace. Mr. Selencky drew inspiration from the river, building it along a distinct horizontal plane to give the impression that it\u2019s floating, according to the architect.\n\n\n\nDecorative details fashioned from tropical Iroko wood add warmth to the home\u2019s hardlines and minimal white palette, images of the home show.\n\n\n\n\u201cWater was a key part of the design,\u201d noted the architect. \u201cThe river plot is so rare and we wanted to make sure the house was in constant dialogue with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nBesides a pool and the Thames itself, the home has a pond at the front that reflects light into bedrooms on the lower ground floor. A dock along the river provides space to moor a day boat, according to estate agents at The Modern House, which listed the home in September.\n\n\n\nSliding glass doors, a staple feature in the desert climate of Southern California but less so in cloudy England, peel away to create a seamless transition from the living room to the home\u2019s limestone patio outside, according to the listing.\n\n\n\nThe property also includes a detached cedar-clad summer house, which sits closer to the river and provides an additional entertaining and recreational space.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: China\u2019s Rich List Shrinks, But the Cash Pile Grows\n\nRecords show the current owners, a businessman and his wife, purchased the property in 2010 for \u00a3740,000 and replaced the existing red-brick bungalow with their modernist dream house in 2013, property records show.\n\n\n\nThe sellers, who could not be reached for comment, have dubbed the home \u201cIsis View,\u201d a nod to an ancient name for the River Thames and a term associated with Oxford University\u2019s rowing team and its student magazine, according to the listing.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Beckie Strum"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-115908?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
