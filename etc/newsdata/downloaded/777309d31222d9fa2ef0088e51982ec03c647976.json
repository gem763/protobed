I\u2019m excited for it, I\u2019m motivated to come out there and put on a show.\u201d\n\nWhile Shahbazyan (10-0 MMA, 3-0 UFC) has only gone past the first round once in his career, Tavares has gone the distance 10 times, which is as much pro fights as Shahbazyan has had in his entire career.\n\nBut \u201cThe Golden Boy\u201d is ready to go all 15 minutes if need be, and says he learnt valuable lessons in his lone decision win over Darren Stewart in his UFC debut in 2018.\n\n\u201cI wrestled the whole fight,\u201d Shahbazyan said on his UFC debut. \u201cI was trying to show a new part of my game that people didn\u2019t know about because coming in as a fast finisher, striker, but I implemented a different part of my game and that was the wrestling part.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat helped me a lot to get that wrestling grind in there, and the octagon jitters along with it.\u201d\n\nShahbazyan was originally scheduled to face Krzysztof Jotko, but an injury forced Jotko out, and Tavares, who also lost his previous opponent Ian Heinisch, stepped in instead. Stylistically, the change in opponent won\u2019t affect Shahbazyan\u2019s preparation much, as fortunately for him, he was getting ready for both stances anyway.\n\n\u201cThe only thing different is that Tavares in an orthodox and Jotko was a southpaw,\u201d Shahbazyan said. \u201cBut here\u2019s the funny thing, actually preparing for Jotko, we were preparing for both a southpaw and an orthodox so I guess it worked out perfectly. It ended up being an orthodox fighter, and it worked out, preparing for both.\u201d\n\nWith the goal to become the youngest champion in UFC history, Shahbazyan is definitely on the right track, as an impressive win over Tavares could catapult him to the upper echelon of the division.\n\nAnd although he\u2019s taking things one step at a time, he is ready for everything that comes with his rise in the division.\n\n\u201cI honestly take it fight by fight,\u201d Shahbazyan said. \u201cI know that every time I win, they\u2019re going to be higher ranked opponents that I\u2019m going to face and that\u2019s eventually going to lead me to title contention. Just taking it one fight at a time, focusing on each fighter individually is the best way, and the way that I look at it, and that\u2019s just the way that I prepare.\u201d\n\nTraining out of Glendale, Calif. under the tutelage of Edmond Tarverdyan, the same trainer who coached former bantamweight champ Ronda Rousey, Shahbazyan is well aware of the criticism his coach continues to receive, but is happy to be the one to prove doubters otherwise.\n\n\u201cA lot of people criticize him and this, that but they didn\u2019t know behind the scenes like what actually goes on,\u201d Shahbazyan said. \u201cYeah I hope I\u2019m showing all these people what\u2019s up right now, I\u2019ve been with Edmond from a young age, I started with Edmond so pretty much like he taught me most of my knowledge in fighting. Screw all the haters, they could see what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d\n\nAnd it will be another marquee event for the young Shahbazyan who will once again be competing on a PPV card. This time on the East Coast, as he looks to put on another spectacular performance on the big stage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historical arena and I\u2019m just blessed to have the opportunity to perform out there in New York,\u201d Shahbazyan said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to New York so it\u2019ll be my first time there and I\u2019m just excited to put on a show for everybody. I\u2019m coming out there to put on a great show, that\u2019s pretty much it. I\u2019m ready, I\u2019m hungry, motivated and I just can\u2019t wait for Nov.2.\u201d", "description": "Edmen Shahbazyan is improving every day, and says expect to see the best version of him yet vs. Brad Tavares at UFC 244.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/edmen-shahbazyan-jack-marshman-ufc-239-11.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
