L. Isaacs National Gymnasium in Nassau which has been turned into a shelter.\n\n\"Nobody can help anybody in Abaco, there's no place safe, everything is destroyed,\" said Firstina Swain, 75, who said she lost her home. \"The people of Abaco need to get out, there are too many dead bodies, and I don't think they finished finding them.\"\n\nA boat with 250 evacuees left battered Abaco and arrived in Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, which is located on New Providence island to the west and was less affected. Another boat with hundreds aboard was on its way, National Voice of the Bahamas radio reported.\n\nApproximately 200 people were also evacuated from Abaco Friday on Bahamasair flights, according to a NEMA spokesperson who declined to be named.\n\n\"Free air evacuations on Bahamasair from Abaco started (Thursday) and will continue until all Grand Bahama and Abaco residents who want to leave are off the islands,\" Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said in a tweet.\n\nFour survivors told Reuters on Thursday they had been charged $75 for a seat on a Bahamasair flight from Abaco to Nassau. \"I thought a relief flight would be free,\" said Anthony Thompson, 27, who said he paid the fare for himself, his wife and his sister. \"I thought wrong.\"\n\nA Bahamasair official, who requested anonymity, told Reuters the airline was collecting its customers whose flights had been canceled during the hurricane. To the extent extra seats were available, it was offering to ferry others off Abaco \"at cost,\" the official said.\n\n'STAGGERING' DEATH TOLL\n\nBahamas Health Minister Duane Sands said there had been \"a tremendous loss of life\" in Abaco's main city of Marsh Harbor.\n\nThe medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau said two refrigerated, 40-foot trucks would be needed to hold the \"staggering\" number of bodies that were expected to be found. \"We've ordered lots of body bags,\" said Dr. Caroline Burnett-Garraway.\n\nThose injured by the storm, which at one point was a Category 5 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity, were treated for fractures, head injuries, lacerations, skin rashes and dehydration.\n\nNear an area called The Mudd in Marsh Harbour, the commercial hub, a Reuters witness described a devastating scene, with most houses leveled, a man lying dead near a main street and dead dogs in water. Some residents were leaving the area with meager possessions, while others were determined to remain.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, working with NEMA, has rescued 295 people since Dorian began, the U.S. embassy in Nassau tweeted.\n\nRelief groups are focusing on getting doctors, nurses and medical supplies into the hardest-hit areas and helping survivors get food and safe drinking water.\n\nThe relief effort faces formidable logistical challenges because of the widespread destruction caused by Dorian, which hovered over the Bahamas for nearly two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-meter) storm surges.", "description": "Hundreds of people fled the Bahamas island of Great Abaco by boat and plane on Friday and thousands more lined up to get on a cruise ship leaving neighboring Grand Bahama to escape the catastrophic aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.
