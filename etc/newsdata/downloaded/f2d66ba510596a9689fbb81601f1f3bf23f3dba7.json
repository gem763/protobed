Our eldest is 16, the girls are eight and 10. That\u2019s very demanding. You have to remain amicable for the sake of the children. Even if on the days when you really want to order an assassin and take each other out.\n\n\"Anyone having a divorce has those days. But we know in the bigger picture the children are more important.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBeverley admitted that James' horrific accident, where he was hit by a truck travelling at 70mph while cycling across America and left with epilepsy and a changed personality, did impact their marriage.\n\n\"We don\u2019t know an awful lot about how the brain works,\" said Beverley. \"James' injuries were to his frontal lobe. That's personality. He was very different.\n\n\"He\u2019s come a long way in that time. Culminating in him going to university and doing his masters. At that point I\u2019m like I\u2019ve done all I can, my work is done.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nJames' ex-wife is pleased that he has found love again with Cambridge University student Jordan Connell.\n\n\"The great thing is he\u2019s met someone who didn't know him before the accident. If you didn\u2019t know him before you\u2019d think he was normal,\" said Beverley.\n\nJoking about his failed Strictly Come Dancing stint, she joked: \"A bit scruffy and can\u2019t dance. But you wouldn\u2019t think that was a guy with a brain injury.\"\n\nJames, who was the first celebrity to be booted out of this year's Strictly Come Dancing , asked his ex-wife for advice before taking part in the show.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBeverley admitted the decision to split from Cracknell came because there weren't setting a good example of what a loving relationship should be like to their kids.\n\nBeverley, who is now dating James Pritchett, a 31-year-old eco-housing property developer, said: \"I narrowed down my pool. I only date men called James. It's very confusing when you\u2019re trying to organise logistics.\n\n\"We unfortunately got outed when we were quite happy to keep it behind closed doors. I feel very lucky. Early days, younger man, what's not to like?\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nThe former couple announced the news in a joint statement earlier this year and vowed to stay committed to their \"amazing children\".\n\nJames has previously insisted that his new relationship with Cambridge University student Jordan Connell had nothing to do with the breakdown of his marriage.\n\nThe Olympic champion admitted that he and Beverley tried 'everything we could to keep it together but things had been a 'struggle with three kids and two careers.'\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX)\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 5 Live , James said: \"It\u2019s not like the accident was last year, it was nine years ago but I guess there\u2019s an element of if you\u2019re the partner you always judge your other half through the prism of what has happened.\n\n\"We\u2019re also, as any couple is, different people from who you were 17 years ago and we can look back and say we did everything.\n\n\"We still get on really well and that\u2019s the most important thing for the kids.\n\n\"It\u2019s never a good time for either Bev or I, or the kids. Hopefully in the long run it will all be alright.\u201d\n\n*Lorraine airs weekdays on ITV at 8.30am", "description": "The former couple have both found love again after announcing their marriage was over in March after 17 years together", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Getty Images", "Instagram", "Getty Images Europe", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528651.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_James-Cracknells-ex-wife-BeverleyTurner-calls-him-scruffy-and-cant-dance-on-Lorraine.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
