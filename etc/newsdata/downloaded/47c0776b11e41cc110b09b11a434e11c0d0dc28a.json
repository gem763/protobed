During several of his appearances, Giuliani repeatedly pushed that Biden should be investigated in the ousting of Viktor Shokin, the former General Prosecutor of Ukraine.\n\nLast week, a whistleblower's complaint was made public that express concern that Trump \"used the power of his office\" to solicit foreign help to discredit Biden during a call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in July. Giuliani is a central figure in the scandal, which has led to the opening of an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nMore: Whistleblower attorney expresses 'serious concerns' over client safety to acting DNI\n\nFrom 'America's mayor' to Trump's pit bull:Rudy Giuliani emerges as central figure in Ukraine firestorm\n\nDunn and Bedingfield argue in their letter that if Giuliani is booked on a show, then a Biden campaign official should be given the same amount of time on the program. They noted that although networks push back in real-time, it is hard to catch up to Giuliani's \"falsehoods and disinformation.\"\n\n\"Your obligation is to provide the American people with an informed, fact-based and responsible coverage and debate of critical issues,\" they wrote. \"Rudy Giuliani has made very clear that his only obligation is to protect Donald Trump, and that he will willingly lie to do so.\"\n\n\"Giving Rudy Giuliani valuable time on your air to push these lies in the first place is a disservice to your audience and a disservice to journalism,\" the letter concluded. \"We ask that you no longer book him on your air.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Joe Biden campaign urges TV networks to not book Rudy Giuliani", "description": "Joe Biden's campaign staff said live fact-checking during Rudy Giuliani's TV appearances is \"no longer enough.\"", "authors": ["Rebecca Morin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wYhJ.KJXlJKGsXqMKaf8SQ--~B/aD0yODE1O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/efa71a2c64de05cf493f6450027fdf02", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
