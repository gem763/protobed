And what better way to celebrate the life and poetry of Robert Burns than in his native Scotland, complete with toasts, songs and an address to the haggis. There are countless places to enjoy a Burns Supper in Edinburgh, including many events that have a ceilidh as part of the festivities.\n\nDay one\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nGet your bearings\n\nEdinburgh is built on seven hills, and divided into the winding streets of the medieval Old Town, and the New Town\u2019s grid-like Georgian architecture. Flanking the city is Edinburgh Castle (1) to the west, and in the east, the grassy nose of Arthur\u2019s Seat (2) in Holyrood Park (3) \u2013 you\u2019re never far from the wind-whipped countryside. The New Town marks the start of a slope leading past the Botanic Gardens (4) towards Leith (5); the regenerated riverside area that\u2019s now home to the Scottish capital\u2019s so-called \u201cMichelin mile\u201d.\n\nThe Edinburgh Icentre tourist office (6) (visitscotland.com/info/services/edinburgh-icentre; 0131 473 3868) is on Princes Street (7).\n\nTake a view\n\nFrom Waverley station (8), head east and follow signs for Calton Hill (9). As you ascend, keep an eye out for the brick Dugald Stewart monument (10), built in honour of the Scottish philosopher, then scramble up the vast stone steps to the Nelson Monument (11), before you reach the hill\u2019s peak: the Grecian columns of the National Monument (12), which sits eerily half-finished. It\u2019s all failsafe selfie territory.\n\nTake a hike\n\nFollow Calton Road (13) until you reach the Palace of Holyroodhouse (14), where Her Majesty resides when she\u2019s in town, then amble down Edinburgh\u2019s most famous street, the Royal Mile (15). If you\u2019re feeling bold, join in with the local tradition of spitting on the Heart of Midlothian (16), a pattern designed into the cobbles to mark the site of the historically unpopular Old Tolbooth prison \u2013 it\u2019s said to bring good luck. Carry on until you reach St Giles\u2019 Cathedral (17).\n\nLunch on the run\n\nThe Elephant House (18) (elephanthouse.biz) was made famous by JK Rowling, who wrote the first Harry Potter novels there \u2013 Hogwarts fans should check out the wizard-themed loos.\n\nFor something more substantial, Outsider (19) (theoutsiderrestaurant.com) uses the best of Scotland\u2019s larder \u2013 mussels, Isle of Mull cheddar and venison \u2013 in its regularly changing menu. Ask for a window seat for views of Edinburgh Castle.\n\nWindow shopping\n\nWalk through the Grassmarket (20) to browse for vintage treasures at W Armstrong and Son (21) (armstrongsvintage.co.uk), quirky gifts at Museum Context (22) (contextinteriors.co.uk), and design-led finds from Scottish makers at Red Door Gallery (23) (edinburghart.com). Next, squeeze between the tenements of 15th-century Milne\u2019s Court (24) and follow the path up the Mound until you reach Princes Street Gardens (25). Around Christmastime, rows of wooden chalets at the bustling market sell crafty presents and mulled wine.\n\nAn aperitif\n\nHeads and Tales (26) (headsandtalesbar.com) is a hole-in-the-wall spot run by Edinburgh Gin Distillery (spot the two huge copper stills behind the bar). Whisky lovers should opt for The Bow Bar (27) (thebowbar.co.uk), where crinkly-faced gents and bearded hipsters choose a dram from the 310 single malts on sale.\n\nDine with the locals\n\nAt the end of a gravel path lies the 19th-century Gardener\u2019s Cottage (28) (thegardenerscottage.co). Sit at the communal wooden tables and enjoy a feast of Scottish game, house-fermented pickles and delicate vegetable small plates \u2013 the tasting menu changes often, but it\u2019s unfalteringly delicious.\n\nIn a vast brick warehouse, Timberyard (29) (timberyard.co) also puts Scottish produce, including sea herbs and foraged mushrooms, at the fore. Start with an inventive cocktail \u2013 think fermented squash with whisky, birch sap and caraway.\n\nDay two\n\nOut to brunch\n\nA short walk from the centre, hidden gem Manna House Bakery (30) (facebook.com/themannahousebakery) sells house-baked butteries (rich bread rolls hailing from Aberdeen) and giant almond croissants.\n\nEdinburgh Larder (31) (edinburghlarder.co.uk) is an airy caf\u00e9 just off the Royal Mile that\u2019s popular for its fill-your-boots breakfasts made with local goodies: porridge is drizzled with Scottish honey; locally sourced fish is flaked through kedgeree; and Ayrshire bacon is used to fill brioche sandwiches.\n\nCultural afternoon\n\nGaze at works by the likes of Monet and Van Gogh plus plenty of Scottish artists (Ramsay, Raeburn and Wilkie) at the Scottish National Gallery (32) (nationalgalleries.org) on The Mound. If you\u2019re willing to venture a little further, the two Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (33) buildings sit opposite in a dramatic sculpture park. Running until February 2018, the immersive NOW exhibition brings together Scottish and international contemporary artists. Both galleries are open daily, 10am-5pm, free entry.\n\nA warren of 17th-century vaults lie beneath your feet in Edinburgh. Explore them \u2013 and learn about the city\u2019s history \u2013 with a tour from The Real Mary King\u2019s Close (34) (realmarykingsclose.com). Tours run Sunday to Thursday, 10am-5pm, Friday and Saturday until 9pm; \u00a314.95.\n\nTake a ride\n\nIt\u2019s easy enough to get around on foot, but frequent buses and trams are helpful for weary legs. Just be sure to have the correct coins, as bus drivers don\u2019t give change. Single journeys (any distance) \u00a31.60, unlimited day ticket \u00a34. Walk a couple of minutes from The Real Mary King\u2019s Close to the Mound Place bus stop (35) and hop on the 41 bus. Travel six stops and alight at Drumsheugh Place (36); a three-minute walk brings you to Dean Village.\n\nA walk in the park\n\nDean Village (37) is a leafy corner in the north-west of the city that feels miles from the crowds of shoppers on nearby Princes Street. Take a frosty walk along the water of Leith (look out for the original watermills) and stop for a photo on Dean Bridge (38).\n\nThe icing on the cake\n\nOn Sundays, the pretty suburb of Stockbridge is home to a charming food market (39) (stockbridgemarket.com). Stock up on handcrafted cakes for the journey home, unusual cheeses for Christmas dinner, and jewellery and gifts made by independent traders. Open 10am-5pm.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nFast, frequent train services arrive in Edinburgh from all over the country \u2013 Virgin Trains East Coast (virgintrainseastcoast.com) departs from London, Leeds and Newcastle.
