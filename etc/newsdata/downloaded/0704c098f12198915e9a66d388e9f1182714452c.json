Police read the transcript of the call to them after recording it secretly.\n\nChhorn said he had become more careful.\n\n\u201cI stopped commenting especially on social media about the current situation after so many CNRP members and supporters were threatened and arrested,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), Kem Sokha (on truck) was arrested for treason after the party performed strongly in local elections in 2017 and was banned.

Sokha has been under house arrest since.\n\nThe dissolution turned Cambodia into a de facto one-party state, and drew serious criticism from Western countries including the European Union.\n\nIn an apparent bid to preserve Cambodia\u2019s preferential trade deal with the EU, Hun Sen relaxed the situation and released political prisoners.\n\nBut after Rainsy announced in August he would return, the crackdown resumed.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere has been far too little reaction to this intensifying crackdown by diplomats and the UN. What\u2019s needed is much higher volume public denunciations in Phnom Penh and foreign capitals of the government\u2019s repressive campaign,\u201d Robertson said.\n\n\n\nRainsy and Hun Sen have a long, antagonistic history that began when Rainsy served as Minister of Finance in the royalist party Funcinpec in the 1990s, where he built a reputation as a crusader against corruption.\n\nHe formed his own party in 1995, gaining a strong following among factory workers and young people.\n\nFor the next 20 years, Rainsy engaged in a delicate balancing act, criticising the government, fleeing the country to avoid charges, and then compromising with Hun Sen to secure his return.\n\nBut each time he returned, his party gained steadily in support and representation.\n\nAfter founding the CNRP with Sokha, the opposition made massive gains in the 2013 and 2017 elections and Rainsy became a more significant threat to Hun Sen\u2019s decades-long hold on power.\n\nSam Rainsy greeting supporters in Phnom Penh in 2013.

[Samrang Pring/Reuters]\n\n'Usurper'\n\nIn recent months, Rainsy has stepped up his rhetoric, and Hun Sen has threatened to deploy the armed forces.\n\n\n\nRainsy denies he is escalating the situation, insisting he is only reacting to Hun Sen\u2019s own unacceptable escalations.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is important to make Hun Sen appear as a usurper who has stolen power from the people through the fake 2018 election held without the participation of the CNRP as the only credible opposition party,\u201d he said in an email to Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cThis in turn justifies our call for a popular uprising because it is legitimate to seek to topple an illegitimate regime.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, Rainsy has alienated Phnom Penh\u2019s intelligentsia, even among those critical of the government.\n\nIn recent weeks, speaking to more highly-educated Cambodians, Rainsy has been called a \u201crabbit\u201d for his tendency to flee, and drawn unfavourable comparisons with Game of Thrones character Littlefinger - a clever but conniving politician mostly defined by his self-interest.\n\n\n\nBut Rainsy\u2019s focus has always been elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe Cambodian ordinary people's common sense and heartfelt support is more important than speculations from a few \u2018intellectuals\u2019,\u201d Rainsy countered.\n\nPolitical analyst Ou Virak said he doubted Rainsy would return, but cautions against the idea that November 9 would \u201cmake or break\u201d his career.\n\n\u201cPeople already assume that if he promises to come and doesn\u2019t come it will be the end of his political career, but no, it won\u2019t be. He\u2019s done this before,\u201d Virak said.\n\nVirak said the \u201cbest case scenario\u201d for Rainsy would be if he was physically prevented from entering Cambodia in the first place.\n\n\u201cThen he can claim moral victory and claim that Hun Sen is afraid,\u201d Virak said.\n\nIndeed, Rainsy already points to the ongoing crackdown as evidence of Hun Sen\u2019s fear, which he has described as a \u201ca victory for the CNRP\u201d.\n\nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, pictured with his personal bodyguard unit in 1997, took control of the country that year after a coup that ousted his royalist co-premier. [ Ou Neakiry/ AP Photo]\n\nOpportunity for change\n\nSome have criticised Rainsy for putting his supporters in danger while he lives in safety abroad - he's been in exile in Paris since 2015.\n\nBut CNRP vice-president Mu Sochua, said it was unfair to blame Rainsy for Hun Sen\u2019s human rights violations.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs it Sam Rainsy or us putting victims in jail? Or are we victims too, direct targets of Hun Sen whose only goal is to stay in power?\u201d she asked.\n\nRainsy\u2019s closest political ally, Sochua also began her political career at Funcinpec, serving as Minister for Women\u2019s Affairs from 1998 to 2004.\n\nShe defected after the assassination of union leader Chea Vichea, inspired by Rainsy\u2019s demands for justice and disappointed by Funcinpec\u2019s silence.\n\n\u201cI share his ethics, I share his principles for justice, I share his sense of commitment,\u201d Sochua said.\n\nHis base still believes in him. Ou Virak, political analyst\n\nVirak said Cambodia now faced its best opportunity for change in the last 25 or 30 years because of growing strains within society.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou have a backlash against Chinese [influence], you have not just a growing economy but growing inequality, you have a population that is mostly 25 years old and younger. All of those ingredients add up to a volatile situation,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd as Virak added: \u201cHis base still believes in him.\u201d\n\nA tuk-tuk driver told Al Jazeera he did believe Rainsy would return.\n\n\u201cLots of people expect him to come back and we\u2019re waiting for him,\u201d he said.\n\nA youth supporter was less certain, but said he wouldn\u2019t blame Rainsy if he didn\u2019t want to risk it.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s more and more sensitive. Since he announced the date, the government arrested a lot of his supporters, so I think even if he wanted to come back it would be very challenging,\u201c he said.\n\nBoth said they had not lost any of their admiration for Rainsy, and refused to choose between him and Sokha.\n\n\u201cBoth of these opposition leaders need to stand strong together, otherwise they won\u2019t have enough power and supporters to fight the CPP and promote democracy,\u201d the tuk-tuk driver said. referring to the ruling Cambodia People's Party.", "description": "Government of longtime leader Hun Sen claims Rainsy's return is a \"coup\", threatening long jail terms for supporters.", "authors": ["Andrew Nachemson", "Yon Sineat"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/10/6/b310cc6ad1294e9084571ade120e5105_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
