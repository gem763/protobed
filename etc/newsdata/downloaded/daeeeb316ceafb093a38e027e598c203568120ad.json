That predictability is sort of a relief after using the iPad Pro and Pixel Slate, both of which have ambitions to replace your laptop but fall short of that goal because of their software (the iPad Pro is restricted, the Pixel Slate is buggy). And to be fair, the Surface Go does, too, but only because you have to be careful not to overtax it.\n\nI\u2019ve been using the LTE version of the Surface Go for the past couple of weeks. I bought it myself, fully knowing what I was getting into \u2014 here\u2019s my review of the regular, non-LTE version. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with the Surface Go, you should read that \u2014 the LTE version is only different in a couple of ways that I\u2019ll get into below. Basically: it\u2019s a tiny Microsoft Surface that\u2019s a little underpowered, but nevertheless could endear itself to you.\n\nInstead of doing all the usual review stuff here, I want to explain why I love this little machine, but wouldn\u2019t recommend it to most people. There are a few reasons I love it and \u2014 just to be very clear at the outset \u2014 a few more reasons I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a smart buy.\n\nThe Surface Go is not a fast computer. It won\u2019t stop you from using it like it is \u2014 instead it will only slow down when you try to do too much. I would never go so far as to say that its limitations are features, but I have found that embracing those limitations instead of fighting them turns out to be a strangely calming exercise in self-restraint.\n\nOur review of Microsoft Surface Go (LTE) Verge Score 7 out of 10 Good Stuff Ultra portable\n\nGreat keyboard, USB-C charging\n\nLTE is super convenient Bad Stuff Battery life\n\nExtra $130 hard to justify for most\n\nBig bezels mean screen is cramped\n\nDongles Buy for $679.00 from Microsoft Buy for $679.00 from Best Buy\n\nLet\u2019s set some context. There\u2019s a ton of innovation and experimentation happening on computers, so much so that the word \u201ccomputer\u201d itself has become fraught. Semantics aside, it\u2019s been a blast to watch big tech companies try to breathe some new life into big-screened computers \u2014 even though it hasn\u2019t been a blast to use some of these early efforts.\n\nAnyway, after years of all the innovation happening in phones, it\u2019s nice to see these larger devices get some attention and I\u2019m optimistic for the future of the, oh what the heck, let\u2019s follow The Wall Street Journal\u2019s David Pierce (and Google) and just call these things \u201cslates.\u201d\n\nOur computers should act a little more like our phones\n\nSo what\u2019s been happening with slates these past few months? Well, the iPad Pro has awe-inducing hardware, but software that can\u2019t live up to it. The Pixel Slate has a few good ideas about how to bring phone software into the tablet and failed to execute any of them well. The Mac, well I don\u2019t know that it fits in with this bunch, but it will eventually run some version of iOS apps, and that little experiment is not going super well, either.\n\nThe Surface Go and Pro have similar ambitions, but it\u2019s easier to forget about them because Microsoft has been pursuing them for so long (with mixed success). But most of all, it\u2019s easy to forget about what the Surface is trying to do because you can always fall back to Good Ol\u2019 Classic Windows apps whenever you need to.\n\nI think you can boil these ideas down to one simple thing: our computers should act a little more like our phones.\n\nJust as a reminder after all the attention that\u2019s been paid to those other devices, I want to spell out some of the ways Microsoft has been pursuing that future. I think they\u2019re worth remembering, almost in a \u201cHey wait, Windows 8 and the original Surface might have had been the right idea way back when\u201d kind of way. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s a mea culpa for doubting the Surface because, mamma mia, did Microsoft do a terrible job executing on its first try at all of these:\n\nCreate a device that can work seamlessly as either a tablet or a laptop, including a kickstand to make the basic ergonomics of hybrid devices less of a hassle.\n\nCreate an interface that seamlessly switches between touch-friendly tablet and mouse-friendly laptop.\n\nRun a new, more mobile-inspired kind of app. Something that\u2019s preferably downloaded from a store that can manage the security and updates of that app. Something that is able to work on different kinds of processors, at different screen sizes, and with touch or a mouse.\n\nRun a managed operating system (S-Mode) that will keep you from installing that one weird thing that screws up your browser, your registry, and lord knows what else. It would be updated and kept secure, without mucking about with version numbers or making you wait for features on a yearly cadence. But if you like, you can just switch over to a full mode that won\u2019t stop you from doing whatever you want.\n\nPlay nice with your phone, no matter what kind of logo is on the back of it. Insofar as your phone maker will let it, Microsoft wants you to be able to access your phone\u2019s stuff on your Surface.\n\nOver time, Microsoft has gotten better at each of these goals. I\u2019d say that Microsoft\u2019s Surface and Windows efforts over the past decade have felt a little bit like Babe Ruth pointing to the stands, then whiffing the first swing, fouling the second pitch, then realizing that just getting on base is better than striking out. There are a lot of base hits with the Surface line, a couple doubles.\n\nThe first Surface RT? Huge whiff. Windows 8, too. Microsoft\u2019s efforts to innovate on apps and create a restricted S-Mode version of Windows 10 all started badly, but recovered (a bit). Time and again, the company has had a pretty clear idea of what its computers should be a few years from now, then tried to ship them right now. And honestly, it wasn\u2019t until the last couple of years that its execution started to catch up to its ambition. It started hitting those doubles.\n\nYou should never buy a computer because of what it is trying to be, you should only buy it if what it currently is lines up with your needs. The Surface slate lineup has gone from \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if\u201d to \u201cthis is pretty cool now.\u201d It\u2019s wild that it took a few years for Microsoft to figure out the difference, but it finally has.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to take the idea that your computer should act more like your phone too literally (hey there, iOS on the iPad!), but I mean it a little differently. Maybe it\u2019s better to say that your computer should feel a little bit more like your phone.\n\nThe Surface Go with LTE feels more like my phone than I expected, and that\u2019s partly why I love it. I\u2019m mostly talking about its physicality, it feels like a phone because it\u2019s small and portable and subtly rounded.\n\nNow, I have to admit that the software experience is not phone-like at all. It takes Windows Hello a few extra beats than it should to recognize you and log you in. It also doesn\u2019t wake from sleep instantly and sometimes Windows still gets that sleep / hibernate thing wrong: it can drain just sitting in your bag. Windows is still Windows.\n\nAnd at least as I use them, the apps don\u2019t often feel phone-like, either. I probably spend 70 percent of my time just using the apps with classic Windows UI and only 30 percent using touch-friendly apps that are designed the way Microsoft really wants them to be. It also means the keyboard is usually attached.\n\nThe more modern apps work well in tablet mode, but a bunch still do not. Having access to desktop apps is genuinely useful! But when you\u2019re in tablet mode and can\u2019t see what you\u2019re typing because the input field is blocked by the virtual keyboard, it\u2019s genuinely annoying. Having Good Ol\u2019 Windows to fall back on means that lots of developers (including Microsoft\u2019s developers) haven\u2019t had to fully commit to the new vision. I get it, though, because when Microsoft tried to make that sharp turn with Windows 8, it bombed.\n\nEven so, I suspect my ratio of old vs. new is pretty common. It\u2019s one of the biggest failures of Microsoft\u2019s \u201cyou can still go back\u201d approach. Because we always go back. Microsoft needs to flip those percentages \u2014 and it needs to do it before Apple figures out how to make iOS less restrictive on the iPad.\n\nBut back to the size of the Surface Go. It really is tiny and I really do carry it around more than my laptop. I have a little bag that fits the Surface Go (or an 11-inch iPad) and just enough stuff. It\u2019s so much lighter and better than my regular laptop bag setup. I have said many, many times that I love small computers and it\u2019s as true today as it was when the 12-inch Apple PowerBook appeared on Yao Ming\u2019s lap in 2003.\n\nI love how tiny the Surface Go is, even though it can feel cramped\n\nI love the Surface Go because it is so small. And yes, I say that fully admitting that the 10-inch screen is tiny and cramped and surrounded by silly-large bezels. That size has me leaning in closer to it. It\u2019s the laptop equivalent of the hunched embrace you have with your phone every day. And doing that has a subtle emotional effect \u2014 the Surface go feels more intimate than other computers. It feels more personal, more mine, simply because it\u2019s so small and close.\n\nThat feeling of intimacy with a device matters, even though the way we talk about it has been tainted by too much marketing. There is something more human about the direct interaction of touching the screen, the ease of lolling out on a comfortable chair and holding the thing in a comfortable place.\n\nI often feel the same way about the 11-inch iPad Pro, but somehow the adjustability of the Surface Go makes it feel more personal than the iPad. The iPad Pro\u2019s keyboard only works at two angles and the iPad Pro\u2019s software just stops you cold when you want to do something. The Surface Go won\u2019t stop you cold, but it will often make you wait. That\u2019s how these things go, you can\u2019t have everything.\n\nIf you spring for one of the LTE models, the Surface Go and the iPad Pro also share another essential phone feature: they\u2019re always online.\n\nThe LTE version of Surface Go will run you $779 (that includes the basic black keyboard, which you\u2019d be silly not to get). That\u2019s $130 more than a similarly specced Go without LTE \u2014 plus whatever you\u2019ll spend on data. Is it worth $130 to not have to faff around with turning on a mobile hotspot on your phone? Most people will logically say no, but for me the answer is Dear God, Yes.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those features that on paper you should reject every single time, but in practice is just really nice. You don\u2019t have to think about having a connection, you don\u2019t have to connect to potentially skeezy Wi-Fi just to grab your email, you don\u2019t have to sit and stare at the settings on your phone and then stare at the settings on your computer to get online.\n\nIt\u2019s just always online, like your phone. For those of a certain age, it\u2019s akin from moving from dial-up to DSL. It\u2019s not necessarily faster, but you just stop thinking about whether you\u2019re connected. You just are. It\u2019s great, and Windows does a very good job of just falling back to LTE when you need it.\n\nI never want to buy another computer again without LTE. That day, sadly, is probably a long ways off. Beyond the fact that not enough people buy the LTE version to justify the cost of making it, I also have to assume there\u2019s something mysteriously difficult about putting a Qualcomm modem in a computer with an Intel processor. My understanding is that it\u2019s more of an engineering challenge than most people realize, and unfortunately I don\u2019t think the Surface Go with LTE overcomes it. More specifically, I\u2019ve experienced notably worse battery life on the Go with LTE than with the original.\n\nOn the original I could get about six hours of active use so long as I took a little care to not overdo it. In the context of it being such a tiny machine, I thought (and think) that\u2019s pretty good. But I have to be way more careful with the LTE version to hit that number \u2014 and usually don\u2019t.\n\nMeasured by active use, it\u2019s a five-hour computer at best. My work requires me to run battery-killers like Slack, so I usually got less. Weirdly, I find the battery life number much more damning on a model with LTE. Because it has LTE built in, you\u2019re going to want to use it away from Wi-Fi more often. And being away from Wi-Fi means being away from power. And that means that the battery life disappoints.\n\nThe entire first week I spent using the Surface Go full time (both this one and the original), I spent an inordinate amount of time looking at the Task Manager and obsessing over what was eating up processor cycles and RAM.\n\nBoth are in short supply on the Surface Go (the LTE model has the same Pentium Gold processor as the Wi-Fi-only version and is only available with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage), and you can drive yourself batty trying to min-max your apps to get things to go faster. This app uses Electron and is Bad, but that app does it in an Edge instance and is Good. This app can edit photos, but really chugs unless I close some of those other apps. This browser is fast and that one is slow. This app is one of the newer modern Windows Store apps and so will probably work better than that other one. This app always runs in the background and you need to hunt down a setting so you know it\u2019s not draining resources when you\u2019re not actually using it. And on and on and on.\n\nThis is not what most people want to sign up for and it\u2019s very much one of the strengths of the iPad Pro \u2014 it never makes you worry about that kind of stuff. But then, I can actually edit Google Docs and move windows around on the Surface Go. So, again, tradeoffs.\n\nAfter that first week, a funny thing started happening. I figured out a pretty decent setup somewhere in there and I stopped opening the Task Manager. I just sort of intuitively knew what the machine could and couldn\u2019t do and if I over-reached, it told me so by slowing down.\n\nI found a kind of peace when using a slightly slower computer because it forced me to be a slightly more deliberate computer user\n\nWatching your computer chug is not fun, but it did serve as a forcing function. I found myself using the computer differently. I opened Tweetdeck less, I limited myself to fewer tabs, I left some apps closed that I used to just happily have going all the time on other computers.\n\niOS basically does this for you \u2014 it closes stuff in the background, it limits what apps can do when they\u2019re not on-screen (and, sadly, limits them a little too much when they are on-screen). With the Surface Go, that cognitive load fell to me. But it wasn\u2019t long before I could do it by feel, I just sort of intuitively knew when the machine was about to redline and pulled back on the throttle before that happened.\n\nAll of which means that I found a kind of peace when using a slightly slower computer because it forced me to be a slightly more deliberate computer user. It\u2019s not exactly the healthy digital balance that everybody\u2019s been striving for this past year since we all started talking about Time Well Spent, but it\u2019s something.\n\nAgain, I am not trying to claim that slowness is a feature! It\u2019s just that there\u2019s something satisfying about knowing a tool\u2019s uses and limits and adjusting your work to remain within them.\n\nThe Surface Go should not be your only computer. When I use it, I often have to leave some work for when I will be back at my desk at a \u201creal\u201d computer. Instead of being frustrated by that, I simply choose to do some other work instead. Or \u2014 get this \u2014 I close it and put it in my bag and do something that doesn\u2019t involve a screen.\n\nA few years ago, my wife and I rented one of those super tiny Fiat 500 cars while on vacation. It was cute and fun to drive, but its wee little engine struggled really hard to maintain speed when heading uphill.\n\nWe didn\u2019t get mad at it for what it couldn\u2019t do. We knew the tradeoffs. Miniature cars have miniature power, and instead of cursing it, we cheered it on. You can do it, little guy, you can make it to the top of this darn hill. It\u2019s going to take longer and those real cars are going to whiz by us, but when we arrive in the town we\u2019re heading to we\u2019ll be able to find a parking spot right away.\n\nThe Surface Go is like that. It\u2019s wildly convenient, but really underpowered. Most of the time, you will just tootle around town with it, doing really simple things. Point A to Point B. Email and Spotify and browsing the web. That is the kind of stuff you should do with the Surface Go, and with LTE, you can do it anywhere.\n\nBut when you really need to, you can load up Photoshop or 30 tabs or whatever your power-user computer thing is. When you do, it\u2019ll chug. The trick isn\u2019t to get mad at it, but to cheer it on. You can do it, little guy.", "description": "Microsoft\u2019s tiny tablet is now available in a new version that supports LTE, for $130 more. Is it worth it?
