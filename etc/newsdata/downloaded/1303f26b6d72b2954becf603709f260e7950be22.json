So far eight vaping-related deaths have been reported in the U.S.\n\nSquare in the center of the controversy is Juul, one of the largest sellers of vape pens, and owned by Altria Group (MO).\n\n\u201cWhat Juul and other companies have been doing is trying to introduce other flavors to get existing smokers to quit smoking,\u201d says Rich Dorment, editor-in-chief at Men\u2019s Health magazine. \u201cOne of the ways they do that is to make vaping more attractive, so you have flavors like menthol and others that make it \u2013 for actual adults, the intended audience \u2013 more palatable and exciting. But what has happened unfortunately, it\u2019s caused it to catch on like wildfire among teenagers.\u201d\n\nWith flavors like bubblegum and mango, many say it\u2019s hard to believe teens aren\u2019t the intended target. According to the CDC, more than 3 million high school students are vaping.\n\nVaping has caught on 'like wildfire' among teens.

And the Trump administration is moving closer to a federal ban on all flavored vaping liquid. But on Sunday, Sen. Charles Schumer, (D-NY) said there is a big loophole.\n\n\u201cThere's one big problem, there is a possible loophole where any company can apply for an exception, and that could be a loophole that swallows the elimination of vaping flavors,\u201d said Schumer. \"Close those loopholes. Don't let them happen. Ban all flavors from e-cigarettes because it's the flavors that attract kids.\"\n\nJust a week ago, the Center for Disease Control launched an investigation.\n\n\u201cCDC has made it a priority to find out what is causing this outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping-related injuries and deaths,\u201d said CDC Director Robert Redfield, M.D. in a statement on its website.\n\nAndy Ramkumar, who works at Gotham Vape in Queens vapes at the store on September 17, 2019 in New York City.

In an internal memo Walmart (WMT) said, \u201cGiven the growing federal, state and local regulatory complexity and uncertainty regarding e-cigarettes, we plan to discontinue the sale of electronic nicotine delivery products at all Walmart and Sam\u2019s Club U.S. locations.\u201d\n\nWalmart is \u201cjoining RiteAid (RAD) and Costco (COST) and other major retailers and saying you know what, we\u2019re fine with actually selling tobacco cigarettes but we\u2019re not going to be stocking these vaping cigarettes anymore,\u201d said Dorment.\n\n\u201cThe industry has grown so quickly and so fast that nobody has really had a chance to wrap their heads around it,\u201d said Dorment. \u201cThey have not found a way to keep it away from teenagers, until they can do that they have a serious problem on their hands.\u201d\n\nTracey Marx Bernstein is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Square in the center of the controversy is Juul, one of the largest sellers of vape pens, and owned by Altria Group.", "authors": ["Tracey Marx Bernstein", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/retKYDVzv9OMTma75nDzEg--~B/aD0zNDI1O3c9NTEzNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/683a8ce0-935d-11e9-bfdf-bffccc0d7ff2", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
