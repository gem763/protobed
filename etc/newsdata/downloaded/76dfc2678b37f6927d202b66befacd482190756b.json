One of these appears to be a watering hole where various different animals congregated. Not only are their bones preserved in the sediments but so too are the footprints they made as they sploshed through muddy ground.\n\n\"We have astounding trackways now - over a hundred individual tracks from different creatures. It's pretty cool because we see evidence of the animals when they were dead and when they were alive,\" Prof Manning told BBC News.\n\nImage copyright Phil Manning Image caption Co-chief scientist Victoria Egerton with the bone of a meat-eating theropod\n\nHe wants to double the size of the dig teams next season, opening up Mission Jurassic again in mid-April to run through perhaps into September.\n\nThis will require some negotiations with the international partners but the Manchester man believes the institutions' continued commitment will be rewarded.\n\n\"I truly believe this will become the largest ever dinosaur dig for any group of British scientists - led of course by The Children's Museum.\"\n\nSome of the remains trucked out last week will go to Indianapolis and some to a Canadian company called Research Casting International.\n\nThe fossils were encased in plaster jackets to protect them during their journey to the lab. Special tools and techniques will be used to clean the bones of extraneous rock. Once that's done, scientists can begin to examine them in detail.\n\nImage copyright Phil Manning Image caption A plaster jacket protects the fossils en route to the lab\n\nThe excavation site has outcrops of two key rock formations from the end stages of the Jurassic. One is the Morrison, which was laid down when what is now North Wyoming was a forested landscape, and the other is the Sundance, which was a preceding environment dominated by a shallow sea.\n\nScientists should therefore have access to a wide range of both land and marine creatures inside the one square mile.\n\nBefore Prof Manning's teams left the dig site, they set up security cameras. The local police and the Bureau of Land Management will be keeping an eye on the quarries through the winter to ensure fossil thieves don't try to lift fossils in the scientists' absence.\n\nImage copyright NHM/Emily Osterloff\n\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "description": "Three full truck loads of dinosaur fossils ship out as scientists end their excavation season.", "authors": ["Jonathan Amos", "Bbc Science Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15782/production/_108583978_truck.jpg"}
