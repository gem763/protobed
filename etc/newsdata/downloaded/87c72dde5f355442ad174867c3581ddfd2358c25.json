The case was postponed to August 19.\n\nEarlier in July, Mothupi made his first appearance in court for the attempted murder of a homeless man whom he allegedly stabbed in Sunnyside, Pretoria, in May.\n\nHowever, he was originally arrested in connection with the attempted murder of another homeless man in February this year in Muckleneuk.\n\nIt later emerged the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) had declined to prosecute this case due to insufficient evidence.
