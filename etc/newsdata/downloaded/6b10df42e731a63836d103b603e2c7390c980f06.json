But Politico alleges that taxpayers, not SpaceX, are bearing the cost of the review.\n\nNASA reportedly agreed to pay SpaceX $5 million in May to cover the cost of the review which included educating employees and ensuring they follow strict guidelines for federal contractors banning drug use. The review was seen by many as a highly unusual expenditure given that it was Musk\u2019s actions which prompted the review in the first place.\n\nThe NASA contract to SpaceX to pay for the workplace review, which was a modification of a previous contract to build a space capsule, added to ongoing tensions with Musk\u2019s established rival Boeing. Boeing and SpaceX are competing to build a new space capsule for NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew Program with SpaceX building the Crew Dragon capsule and Boeing manufacturing the Starliner, both of which are behind schedule.\n\nBoeing also performed the same workplace safety and culture review, but unlike SpaceX it didn\u2019t receive any extra funds to do. Pete Garrettson, a recently retired Air Force lieutenant colonel and space strategist commented on the situation stating: \u201cAs a taxpayer why would I pay when I don\u2019t have to? If I was Boeing, I also would have said, \u2018Why am I being punished without the same compensation?\u2019\u201d\n\nGarrettson added: \u201cIf I was at NASA, I\u2019d say, \u2018How much was your contract [for the Commercial Crew Program] padded compared to SpaceX?\u2019\u201d SpaceX stated that it is using the money to cover the cost of the review which includes interviewing staff across the country and was not part of the company\u2019s original contract for the Crew Dragon capsule in 2014. Boeing is carrying out the review under its current contract which includes additional costs of conducting interviews with employees.\n\nJames Gleeson, a SpaceX spokesman, stated: \u201cSpaceX worked closely with NASA to account for additional work beyond the scope of the contract.\u201d A Boeing spokesperson stated: \u201cNASA is moving forward with fulfilling the objectives of their safety assessment under our current contract, and we are prepared to help our customer meet those goals.\u201d\n\nNASA stated that it is \u201cstandard practice\u201d for a company to receive additional funds for work not included in the original contract but did not directly answer why no additional funds were offered to Boeing. A NASA spokesperson told Politico that \u201cafter discussions with Boeing\u2026we decided we wouldn\u2019t pursue a contract modification to carry out the assessment that\u2019s underway.\u201d\n\nGreg Autry, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California who served on the Trump administration\u2019s NASA transition team, commented on the situation stating: \u201cThe idea of NASA ever giving SpaceX preferential treatment over Boeing is simply giggle-inducing to industry insiders. At every step of the way Boeing got more [money] in the [Commercial Crew development] program. Far, far more than $5 million. Even discussing $5 million in this context is silly.\u201d\n\nGarrettson added: \u201cWhat we have here is an important cultural divide between what is considered appropriate behavior in the old guard in the space community and what is considered OK among Silicon Valley tech people and a growing sector of Americans.\u201d\n\nRead the full report in Politico here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
