Furthermore, keeping a dog is a good motivation for physical activity, which is an important factor in rehabilitation and mental health.\"\n\nBut Fall added that more studies are needed in order to act on the findings in a way that supports heart attack and stroke patients.\n\n\"More research is needed to confirm a causal relationship and giving recommendations about prescribing dogs for prevention,\" Fall said.\n\n\"Moreover, from an animal welfare perspective, dogs should only be acquired by people who feel they have the capacity and knowledge to give the pet a good life.\"", "description": "People who own dogs may live longer and benefit from\u00a0improved cardiovascular health, new research has found.
