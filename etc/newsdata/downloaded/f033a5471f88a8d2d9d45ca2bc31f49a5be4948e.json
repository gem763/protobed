The entertainment mogul came on Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cOn the Move\u201d to discuss his sneaker line, his Millionaire Mastery masterclass, and even plans to create the next Disney (DIS).\n\n\u201cI feel that knowledge is more important than money,\u201d Miller told Yahoo Finance.\n\nThat\u2019s why he wants to impart his know-how in his new Master P masterclass, Millionaire Mastery Business and Marketing Conference, which starts on October 5th in New York City. He says he\u2019ll highlight both his successes and mistakes with the aim of teaching tenacity.\n\n\u201cI tell people all the time commitment is what gets you to your dreams and goals,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMiller tells people that they just have to \u201cget into the game when it comes to business.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s done. The New Orleans\u2013native recently stepped into the footwear game with a sneaker line called MoneYatti.\n\n\u201cWe went from high fashion tennis shoes, and now we\u2019ve created a shoe that can compete with Nike (NKE) Adidas (ADDYY).

He now believes that his life\u2019s mission is to give back. \u201cEveryone has a purpose, and I feel mine is to educate the next generation and show them what I\u2019ve been through,\u201d he said.\n\nThe multi-platinum musician says that people who want to be successful in the business world need to embrace their fears. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to grow up, don\u2019t be afraid to change, don\u2019t be afraid to do the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cDoing the right thing, you\u2019ll be around for a long time, doing the wrong thing you won\u2019t, and that\u2019s been the key to our success.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Master P? He and his son, fellow entertainer Romeo, plan to expand their filmmaking partnership. \u201cMe and my son are really into our movies because you can really tell your story through movies.
