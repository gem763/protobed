Bailey escorted her to and from the Brooklyn federal courthouse in July, when her husband was sentenced for running the world\u2019s largest narcotics trafficking group.\n\nBailey\u2019s attorney, Jeffrey Cohen, said his client\u2019s side jobs are \u201cirrelevant.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not being brought up on charges for that,\u201d Cohen told The Post. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is, he\u2019s pled not guilty, and I\u2019m investigating the matter.\u201d\n\nBailey\u2019s prosecution involves conduct that postdates Guzman\u2019s trial and does not involve the Sinaloa Cartel, according to the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nA cocaine sting nets Miami police officers alleged to have worked for drug dealers and hitmen\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Bailey met last month with an undercover officer he believed was a drug dealer. On two occasions, Bailey agreed to provide security as packages of cocaine were transported from location to location. He was paid in cash per kilogram moved.\n\nBailey earned $2,500 on Sept. 4 for driving a duffel bag filled with drugs to a parking lot in Queens, prosecutors said. The following week, Bailey again acted as a security guard for the undercover officer, according to the complaint, and he was paid $10,000 to pick up two kilograms of cocaine.\n\nJohn Ryan, the acting district attorney of Queens County, said Bailey \u201ctook an oath to enforce the law. Today, sadly, he is accused of taking part in an illicit drug operation.\u201d\n\nNew York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill also condemned Bailey\u2019s alleged betrayal.\n\n\u201cThere is no place for corruption within the NYPD,\u201d O\u2019Neill said at a news conference after the arrest. \u201cWhen an individual officer intentionally tarnishes the shield worn proudly by thousands before him, he will be held to the highest account the law provides.\u201d\n\nBailey is scheduled to appear in court Oct. 3.\n\nRead more:\n\nEnd of an American tradition: Amtrak kills the dining car\n\nJudge declines to drop charges against Coast Guard lieutenant accused in terrorist plot\n\nTrump-supporting cheerleaders were going to take the field.
