We are now sitting at R 2 billion overall in unauthorised expenditure.\u201d\n\nImportance of quantity surveyors\n\nFeinberg added: \u201cQuantity surveyors should be the first people government officials phone to find out why a project is over budget. It should be the quantity surveyor, not the architect not the engineer or anybody else. It is the quantity surveyor who is specialised in dealing with the holistic construction budget.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure Patricia de Lille called for an overhaul of her department\u2019s register and intensified action against corrupt officials after more corruption revelations were uncovered.\n\nIn July, De Lille announced that all tenders issued by her department would be open for public scrutiny, from evaluating the documents to the adjudication, in a bid to root out corruption related to leases, and ensure that land and assets owned by the state are \u201cused for the public good\u201d.\n\nSpecialised skills\n\nIn August, City Press reported that De Lille\u2019s quest of an overhaul included getting rid of officials who were irregularly appointed between 2017 and last year.\n\nChairperson of the built environment matters committee on the Council for the Built Environment Zandile Makhathini stressed the importance of \u201crecognising that a quantity surveyor\u2019s skills are specialised and greatly needed on construction projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cEngineers and construction managers do not have the same skills as professional quantity surveyors,\u201d she said.\n\nWith her department mandated to be custodian and portfolio manager of the national government\u2019s immovable assets, Makhathini noted with great concern how there are \u201cvirtually no quantity surveyors within many government departments.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cGovernment departments need to make roles for quantity surveyors available at competitive salaries so that they can control costs and help us derive value from our building projects and assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lack of competitive salaries for quantity surveyors is one of the biggest reasons for the lack of professional expertise within the department. There is currently one quantity surveyor and three candidate surveyors who manage the projects that make up the R12 billion budget of the department.\u201d\n\nIt was a sentiment shared by Feinberg: \u201cQuantity Surveyors are professionals. They go through a process of recognition and acceptance into a council and they need to reach a certain level of professionalism and have a certain amount of experience as well as academic requirement in order to progress to that level. In much the same way as an architect is able to charge professional fees, quantity surveyors are as well,\u201d he told City Press.\n\n\u201cThere is a disparity in government in terms of not being able to either have the appropriate resources devoted to recruiting quantity surveyors - who are the best placed people to manage entire construction budgets.\n\n\u201cGovernment is not attracting the required services of quantity surveyors and yet the one or two that are recruited within government ranks are now responsible for overseeing a large number of projects. They cannot be asked to provide the kind of detail and scrutiny to each of these projects with an oversight of projects to the value of sometimes R10 billion to R15 billion,\u201d Feinberg said.", "description": "The consistent lack of quantity surveyors in government departments is the root of infrastructure budget misspending.", "authors": ["Palesa Dlamini"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/3940/ed5aa9ac95a645b783d9e7ed81c804bc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
