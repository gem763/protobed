There is growing recognition, within the region, of the potential of capital-market solutions,\" MAS said in the report.\n\nEarlier in February, MAS included social and sustainability bonds to its Green Bond Grant Scheme, which has been renamed the Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme.\n\nUnder the scheme, issuers of green, social and sustainability bonds that obtain an external review are able to fully offset their external review expenses, subject to a funding cap of S$100,000 per issuance.\n\nSocial and sustainability bonds have a \"distinct yet complementary role to green bonds\", with sustainability bonds delivering a mix of social and environmental benefits, MAS said.\n\nSingapore's green bond market stands at over S$6 billion today. Local issuers include City Developments and DBS, while foreign issuers include Canadian insurer Manulife Financial Corporation and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency.\n\n\"In the months ahead, we will continue to contribute to global initiatives to mainstream sustainable finance and look forward to supporting more companies in their efforts to raise capital for sustainable growth,\" MAS said.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - A RECORD volume of S$96 billion in long-term corporate debt was issued in Singapore last year, up 7.8 per cent from the previous year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) noted in its Singapore Corporate Debt Market Development 2019 report on Friday. .
