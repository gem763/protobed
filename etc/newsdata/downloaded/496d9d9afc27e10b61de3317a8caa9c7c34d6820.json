While I\u2019m not always able to read the comments on my columns, I do try to give the more controversial ones a closer look, mainly to get a feel for the overall consensus and look for any flaws in my logic which would inevitably be pointed out by multiple commenters.\n\nAs expected, my feelings on this drew plenty of both agreement and disagreement. However, one theme that kept coming up was the seeming pessimism displayed in the columns. To be fair, they were written to be a sobering reminder of why we have to fight the Second Amendment battle \u2013 and indeed the battle for all our freedoms \u2013 on the legislative front BEFORE laws are passed taking them away. Once that happens, regaining any freedom lost becomes exponentially more difficult.\n\nBut suppose it does happen. Suppose, despite our best efforts, the left manages to seize complete power and, regarding gun control specifically, outlaw everything except single shot rifles and shotguns. What then? Well, as I contended in those columns, armed revolution is unlikely to happen for all the reasons described and more (several commenters did a great job adding a host of other reasons to support my hypothesis). America will likely go the way of places like Australia and England, and individual gun owners will be driven, one by one, into either hiding their weapons \u2013 thus rendering them useless \u2013 or, should they use them to defend themselves or someone else, into the criminal justice system.\n\nBut wait, this is America, you say, not Australia or England. We\u2019ve got the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and a national tradition of self-reliance and resistance to tyranny unlike any other nation. And you\u2019d be right, to the extent that the spirit of those things remain, which is why several factors that do NOT involve some sort of apocalyptic armed conflict could restore hope to freedom-lovers even if the left is able to someday win their seemingly inevitable legislative victories. Here are three:\n\nJury Nullification\n\nLike \u201cFight Club,\u201d the one rule of jury nullification these days is: \u201cDon\u2019t talk about jury nullification.\u201d What was once perceived as an important and valid tool for making sure the law didn\u2019t go too far into the realm of unjust tyranny has become feared by judges and lawmakers terrified of losing control to the one thing they really have absolutely zero control over \u2013 an American jury. In truth, a jury can, in theory, declare someone innocent of a crime regardless of what the law says, regardless of actual guilt or innocence, but simply on the basis that a particular law is unjust.\n\nThe establishment doesn\u2019t want you or anyone else to know that, of course, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true. When it comes down to brass tacks, how many small town red state juries will vote to convict, say, a mother who used her AR-15 to defend herself and her small children from a home invader, or an elderly man for keeping the gun his grandfather passed down to him?\n\nSure, such injustices happen today and will happen then, and all-too-many juries are sadly all-too-unaware of their power, but in such an environment as we\u2019d be facing in this scenario, it wouldn\u2019t take long for word to spread. Nullify these laws enough times, and lawmakers might be forced to change them or continue looking like the ridiculous tyrants they are.\n\n10th Amendment\n\nThe 10th Amendment to the Constitution, included in the Bill of Rights, states: \u201cThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\u201d It helps lay out federalism, the relationship between federal and state governments, but it also provides a legal underpinning behind states and local governments asserting their rights over an increasingly growing federal leviathan.\n\nSince conservatives have the White House, we\u2019re already seeing various blue states push back on issues like federal drug laws with marijuana legislation and immigration policy with sanctuary cities and states. We can argue about whether the Constitution actually gives those powers to the federal government, but the point is when Democrats regain the White House at some point, as they certainly will, it will be red states\u2019 turn to use both the Second and Tenth Amendments to push back against absurd liberal notions like the inevitable overreaching gun legislation.\n\nThat said, being particularly fond of intellectual consistency, I tend to be more forgiving of blue states going their own way today on issues, because I know full well we\u2019ll probably need the same consideration in the future. To that end, California can keep their marijuana and choke on it, as far as I\u2019m concerned, but they\u2019d damn well better let Tennessee be Tennessee when the time comes. That\u2019s true federalism, and going forward that\u2019s likely the only thing that could maintain the uneasy truce between liberals and conservatives in America.\n\nTechnology & Social Media\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think that leftists, when and if they get total control, would resort to the practices of their 20th Century ideological forebears \u2013 leftist \u2018heroes\u2019 like Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot, and Mao \u2013 and just start killing people willy-nilly, particularly those they disagree with. And don\u2019t get me wrong, they likely would if they could. However, in an age where the slightest injustice can be recorded and broadcast to billions in an instant, any future leftist overreach will be met with condemnation of freedom-loving people worldwide.\n\nWhy do you think Big Tech is so hellbent on curbing the free speech of so many on the ideological right? Thankfully, technology itself is ideology-free, and alternatives to the platforms currently controlled by the left are likely to continue to develop. Stories of any injustices committed will become increasingly difficult to hide, and technology will continue to allow like-minded people to work together and know they aren\u2019t alone.\n\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Hong King now. I don\u2019t know what will ultimately happen there, but it\u2019s hard to imagine things going down like 1989, and the main difference between the two eras is the emergence of technology. If the Chinese conducted a Tiananmen Square-style massacre, imagine the images and videos that would emerge. The Chinese may be Godless Communists, but even they don\u2019t want to be global pariahs.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s impossible to predict the future, much less all the variables that could affect how any future leftist control is mitigated. But things don\u2019t necessarily have to end with a whimper OR a bang. Things could end with an uneasy truce and, however difficult, the clawing back of freedoms once lost.", "description": "On at least two occasions here at Townhall, I\u2019ve addressed .10/07/2019 0:07:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/332/d0e884bd-0daf-4a12-aea9-c0daa2b4ebf3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
