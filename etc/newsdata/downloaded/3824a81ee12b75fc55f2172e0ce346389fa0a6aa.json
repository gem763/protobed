Previously, the card offered two points per dollar spent on travel booked through Amex and one point per dollar on everything else.\n\nNew card members also receive 30,000 points after spending $2,000 on eligible purchases in the first three months.\n\nHow Green from Amex Stacks Up\n\nSo how good is the new Green from Amex? While the changes make the card more attractive, it doesn\u2019t change MONEY\u2019s opinion about the Best Credit Cards for 2019.\n\nThose looking for the sweetest travel rewards can still do better with Chase Sapphire Reserve, which has a steep $450 annual fee but comes with a sign-up bonus worth up to 50,000 points, or $500 if redeemed for cash, plus three points per dollar spent on travel and dining.\n\nIf that annual fee is too steep for you, Wells Fargo Propel American Express Card has no annual fee and still offers perks that largely align with Green from Amex\u2019s: a sign-up bonus worth 30,000 points plus three points per $1 spent on travel and dining and one point per $1 spent elsewhere.", "description": "The fee is higher, but the rewards are richer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LU5QsJuzj6c3.3.VCbhJCw--~B/aD02Nzg7dz0xMDE4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/money_403/2094d9820626ac6dbd1a6fa6b17a460a", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
