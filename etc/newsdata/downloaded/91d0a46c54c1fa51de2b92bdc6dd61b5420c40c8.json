Imagine a car where the gearbox (my eyes) isn't connected properly to the engine (brain).\n\n'Sometimes words are just shapes... I can see the shape but it simply has no meaning.'\n\nMr Kyle, 49, said the last time he was assessed, when he was aged 30, his reading and comprehension age was estimated at eight years and three months.\n\nThe Labour backbencher said he struggles with some words more than others, such as 'loose' and 'lose' which required him to keep a reminder on his desk.\n\nMeanwhile, he was recently met with derision when he misspelled 'border' - instead using the word 'boarder'.\n\nLabour MP Peter Kyle has set out what it is like to live with acute dyslexia as he urged people online to be kinder to those with 'unseen challenges'\n\nMr Kyle, 49, set out his thoughts in a Twitter thread. He said he often received 'sneering or brutal' responses to spelling errors\n\nHe added that while 'most people were forgiving, hundreds were not' and that he had been called 'thick' and 'stupid' and told to 'resign and let someone with a brain take over'.\n\n'I'm very resilient, but it reminded me of a time when I wasn't,' Mr Kyle said.\n\nDespite 'painful' experiences of reading Shakespeare the MP said most teachers were kind and he 'had a lot of affection' for his school, but he left without any usable qualifications.\n\nHe said he returned when he was 25 to start again, adding: 'Just imagine the humiliation of walking into that classroom.'\n\nHe was later accepted to Sussex University and left six years later left with a degree and a doctorate.\n\nMr Kyle said he copes now by using spellcheck tools and working 'harder than most'.\n\n'So if you're part of the spelling police there's 649 other MPs out there, enjoy!' he concluded.\n\nMr Kyle's comments online prompted a wave of praise from colleagues on both sides of the political divide.\n\nHealth Secretary and Conservative MP Matt Hancock tweeted: 'Massive respect to @peterkyle for speaking out so openly about his dyslexia.\n\n'Important to remember: being (dyslexic) makes spelling difficult, but it's not a weakness - it's a strength.'\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy tweeted: 'Just when you think you can't love @peterkyle more he proves again he's a man of courage and compassion..\n\n'Thank you for speaking about dyslexia Dr and breaking it down in this beautiful way.'", "description": "Labour MP Peter Kyle has hit out at the online 'spelling police' as he won praise from his colleagues for describing what it is like to live with acute dyslexia.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/18/20291862-0-image-a-11_1572286837834.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
