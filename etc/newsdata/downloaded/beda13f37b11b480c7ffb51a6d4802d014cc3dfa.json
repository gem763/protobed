She was living away from home for the first time, and she thinks her grandmother was drawn by some sense of that. She eventually told her parents what happened, and according to her they were concerned, but not overly panicked. \u201cMy parents are probably the least judgmental people I know,\u201d she said. As Jessica tells it, over the next two years, spirits visited her every now and again. Her brother-in-law\u2019s deceased father began forming before her, ghostlike, just as her grandmother did. And while the experiences were intense and at times made her feel \u201ccrazy,\u201d she said, they were infrequent, and insists that they were never a real source of suffering. Testing the therapies of the future\n\nRead more Jessica later moved back home and got a job as a pharmacy technician, all the while figuring out how to cope with what was happening to her. At a co-worker\u2019s suggestion, she went to the Healing in Harmony center in Connecticut. In 2013, she says, she enrolled in classes there that taught her to use her \u201cgift.\u201d A self-described psychic medium, Jessica tells me she hears voices that other people do not (in addition to sometimes seeing people others do not see), at varying intensity, and mostly through her right ear. Meeting others like her at the center gave Jessica a sense of relief. \u201cJust being around people who are going through similar things\u2014that helps a lot, because I could talk to anybody about those things and not feel like I was crazy,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was through a friend from the center that Jessica ended up in the lab of Philip Corlett and Albert Powers, a psychologist and a psychiatrist at Yale. In a study published last fall in Schizophrenia Bulletin, Powers and Corlett compared self-described psychics with people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who experience auditory hallucinations. \u201cA lot of the time, if someone says they hear voices, you immediately jump to psychotic illness, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,\u201d Corlett said. But research suggests hearing voices is not all that uncommon. A survey from 1991\u2014the largest of its kind since\u2014found that 10 to 15 percent of people in the U.S. experienced sensory hallucinations of some sort within their lifetime. And other research, as well as growing advocacy movements, suggest hearing voices isn\u2019t always a sign of psychological distress. The researchers at Yale were looking for a group of people who hear voices at least once a day, and had never before interacted with the mental-health-care system. They wanted to understand, as Corlett put it, those who do not suffer when \u201cthe mind deviates from consensual reality.\u201d What Corlett calls consensual reality\u2014the \u201cnormative shared experience we all agree on\u201d\u2014is probably not something you spend too much time thinking about. But you know when it\u2019s being violated. The sky is blue, the sun is hot, and as Corlett points out, most would generally agree that people don\u2019t receive extrasensory messages from one another.\n\nJessica was quite frank with me about the way some people may view her. \u201cWe know these experiences are weird and they\u2019re seen as weird,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t go into a room and say \u2018Hey, I\u2019m a psychic medium\u2019 and people are gonna accept you.\u201d Finer points of what counts as reality can change over time, and vary based on geography or culture. For centuries people walked the earth believing the sun orbited around them, which today would be considered unreasonable. Who decides that consensus, and where along its boundaries voice hearers fall, depends on a wide range of circumstances. The anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann, who has studied voice hearing in psychiatric and religious contexts, has written that \u201chistorical and cultural conditions \u2026 affect significantly the way mental anguish is internally experienced and socially expressed.\u201d Noting that there is no question psychiatric distress and schizophrenia are \u201creal\u201d phenomena that call for treatment, Luhrmann adds that \u201cthe way a culture interprets symptoms may affect an ill person\u2019s prognosis.\u201d Every psychiatrist I spoke to shared the belief that unusual behavior should only enter into the realm of diagnosis when it causes suffering. On the other hand, Luhrmann tells me \u201cit\u2019s a terribly romantic idea\u201d to overinterpret the effects of culture. To say, for instance, that \u201canybody who would be identified with schizophrenia in our culture would be a shaman in Ecuador\u201d is, in her mind, a clear mistake: \u201cFlagrant psychosis\u201d exists in some form in every culture where anthropologists have looked. \u201cGoodness knows what psychosis actually is.\u201d In the past decade, researchers have taken a greater interest in the experience of hearing voices outside the context of psychological distress. In his book The Voices Within, the psychologist Charles Fernyhough traces the way thoughts and external voices have been understood by science and society throughout time.*\n\nReflecting on Fernyhough\u2019s book, Jerome Groopman notes that in the early parts of the Bible, the voice of God gave direct commands to Adam, Abraham, and Noah. It spoke to Moses through the Burning Bush, going by the Book of Esther, making itself known again to the apostle Paul in the New Testament. Socrates, who wrote nothing down, heard a \u201csign\u201d from childhood. The voices of three saints guided Joan of Arc as she rebelled against the English. Groopman cites Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s autobiography, in which he describes \u201cthe quiet assurance of an inner voice\u201d telling him to \u201cstand up for righteousness.\u201d The social context in which these people lived can impact how they\u2019re seen. It\u2019s impossible to say how the prophet Ezekiel was understood within his cultural moment. But in most places today, if a person claimed\u2014as Ezekiel does\u2014that he ate a scroll because the Lord commanded him to do so, some eyebrows might be raised. In a community where a personal, verbal relationship with God is normal, the reception may be different. Powers and Corlett\u2019s work orbits the idea that schizophrenia is, as Powers put it, an \u201coutmoded\u201d label that describes a cluster of different symptoms rather than a single unified condition, he says. \u201cGoodness knows what psychosis actually is,\u201d Luhrmann said. \u201cThere are clearly different kinds of events in the domain we call psychosis,\u201d and when it comes to the relationship between voice hearing and psychosis, she says, \u201cthere\u2019s so much we don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nMany now antiquated psychiatric diagnoses reified fear, misunderstanding, or prejudice toward people at society\u2019s margins. At the time of the women\u2019s suffrage movement in London, hysteria was leveled as a charge against women who broke social codes. A Mississippi psychiatrist in the 19th century proposed that slaves who attempted escape suffered from \u201cdrapetomania.\u201d And until 1973, homosexuality was considered a disease of the mind rather than an accepted way of being in the United States\u2014and was only fully removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1987. In his book Hallucinations, the late Oliver Sacks details a controversial experiment in which eight participants showed up at hospitals throughout the U.S. in the early \u201970s and complained only of \u201chearing voices.\u201d All of them were immediately diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and hospitalized for two months, despite reporting no other medical symptoms, family history, or signs of personal distress. The single symptom, Sacks writes, was seen as cause enough. People with psychiatric disorders do hear auditory hallucinations in relatively high numbers. According to Ann Shinn, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital, 70 to 75 percent of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and between one-third and one-tenth of people with bipolar disorder report hearing voices at some point in their life.\n\nIn the case of voice hearing, culture may also play a role in helping people cope. One study conducted by Luhrmann, the anthropologist, found that compared to their American counterparts, voice-hearing people diagnosed with schizophrenia in more collectivist cultures were more likely to perceive their voices as helpful and friendly, sometimes even resembling members of their friends and family. She adds that people who meet criteria for schizophrenia in India have better outcomes than their U.S. counterparts. She suspects this is because of \u201cthe negative salience\u201d a diagnosis of schizophrenia holds in the U.S., as well as the greater rates of homelessness among people with schizophrenia in America. The influence of social context was part of what motivated Corlett and Powers: The two were interested in whether the support of a social group can help them understand where disorder and difference intersect. When they set out to design their study, they needed an otherwise healthy group of people who hear voices on a regular basis, and whose experiences are accepted in their social group. Next, they needed to find some psychics. Corlett told me he got the idea to reach out to a Connecticut-based organization for psychics after noticing the ads for psychics and tarot-card readers on his daily bus route. When the two interviewed those participants, they noticed something striking: The psychics described hearing hearing voices of similar volumes, frequencies, and timbres as the patients. Powers and Corlett took this to mean that the psychics were actually hearing something. The two also vetted their participants with the same techniques that forensic psychiatrists use to determine whether a person is pretending to experience psychiatric symptoms, giving them more reason to believe what they were told.\n\nCompared to their diagnosed counterparts, more of the psychics described the voices as a force that \u201cpositively affects safety.\u201d And all of the psychics attributed the voices to a \u201cgod or other spiritual being.\u201d The patients, meanwhile, were more likely to consider their voices a torment caused by a faulty process in their brain. Many of them described the voices as \u201cbothersome,\u201d and also claimed that the first time they told anyone what they were hearing, they received a negative response. Just like Jessica, the psychics were more likely to say that they received a positive reaction the first time they spoke about their experience. Jessica\u2019s mother, Lena, told me she maintained a supportive, nonjudgmental attitude toward her daughter\u2019s accounts, just as she did when her other daughter converted to Scientology. She waited for Jessica to bring them up and discussed them with an open mind. She says she was happy Jessica found the center, adding that her only concern was that Jessica\u2019s experiences did sometimes seem to be distressing her and leaving her \u201cdrained.\u201d When Jessica tells me about the people and things she hears, she describes a range of experiences rather than one consistent phenomenon. Her most meaningful episodes of voice hearing are those like the visits she had from her grandmother and her brother-in-law\u2019s father. But she also describes things like hearing the number a friend is thinking, and the persistent and vivid presence of a childhood imaginary friend (her mother told me Jessica demanded the table be set for him at every meal). To Jessica, these experiences differ in degree rather than kind from the ghosts of the dead who appear in front of her with persistent messages for her and for others. Though these might not all fit into the popular conception of a psychic, she understands them to exist along that same continuum.\n\nIn his book, Fernyhough describes a series of experiments meant to provide evidence for the connection between inner speech and hearing voices. In one, participants were played recordings of other people\u2019s speech alongside recordings of their own, disguised and distorted, and told to mark whether the voice was their own or someone else\u2019s. Those who experienced hallucinations were more likely to misidentify their own altered voices. A much older experiment found a kind of unconscious ventriloquism among a group of people with schizophrenia: When participants began to hear voices, researchers noted \u201can increase in tiny movements in the muscles associated with vocalization.\u201d The voices they heard came, in some sense, from their own throats.\n\nThese experiments suggest that auditory hallucinations are the result of the mind failing to brand its actions as its own. Watching what the brain does during these hallucinations may clarify how that works, and what differences in the brain create these experiences. \u201cWhen your brain signals to generate a movement,\u201d Shinn, the psychiatrist at Harvard, told me, \u201cthere is a parallel signal [known as an efference copy] that basically says \u2018this is mine, it\u2019s not coming from outside.\u2019\u201d This helps creates the sense of where a person is in space, that their hand belongs to them and it is moving from point A to B. In this way, the body labels its motions, and a possible parallel may exist for speech and thought. When people hear voices, they may be hearing \u2018unmarked\u2019 thoughts they do not recognize as their own.\n\nBeyond that, Shinn told me, what is understood about the experiences of people who hear voices is limited. She sees Corlett and Powers\u2019s study as part of a growing interest in the lives of \u201chealthy voice hearers\u201d\u2014an interest spurred, in part, by the Hearing Voices Movement. A network of advocacy groups, the Hearing Voices Movement presents an alternative to the medical approach based on the belief that the content of a person\u2019s voices can reflect the hearer\u2019s mental and emotional state. The groups encourage an approach in which, with the help of a facilitator or counselor, hearers listen to, speak back to, and negotiate with the messages they hear in hopes of learning to cope. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna talk right now. ... I still have to live this human life.\u201d The hearing-voices advocate Eleanor Longden has said she considers her voices \u201ca source of insight into solvable emotional problems\u201d rooted in trauma rather than \u201can aberrant symptom of schizophrenia.\u201d As Longden tells it, that\u2019s how her own experiences with voices were understood when she first sought treatment for anxiety. Her psychiatrist told her how limited her life would be by her voices, she says, and the voices grew more adversarial. Many mental-health-care providers\u2014Shinn, Corlett, and Powers included\u2014seem receptive to the Hearing Voices Movement\u2019s critiques, including an overemphasis on medication and an imperative for patient-focused treatment. Shinn credits the network with encouraging an approach that treats voice hearing as more than a checklist item adding up to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and helping to reduce the stigma attached the experience of voice hearing.\n\nBut \u201cthere are certainly a lot of people for whom that will not be enough,\u201d she says. For some patients, voices can be impossible to reason with, and the burden of other symptoms of psychosis\u2014disordered thought, delusions, the inability to feel pleasure\u2014can be too great. And Powers and Corlett expressed concerns that the Hearing Voices Network may promote a false divide: the idea that the voices\u2019 perceived roots in trauma\u2014rather than some accident of biology\u2014means hearers should avoid medication. Biology and experience, they say, can\u2019t be so neatly separated. (Longden has written that \u201cmany people find medication helpful,\u201d and that the International Hearing Voice Network advocates for \u201cinformed choice.\u201d) While Powers and Corlett don\u2019t believe the psychics and patients are experiencing the exact same thing, the two are cautiously hopeful that about a potential lesson in the greatest difference between those groups: the ability to control the voices they hear, which is something the psychics, including Jessica, showed in greater number than their counterparts. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in certain situations, I\u2019m not open,\u201d Jessica said. For instance, when she\u2019s at work, the voices \u201ccan come in,\u201d she says, they \u201ccan hang out, but I\u2019m not gonna talk right now. ... I still have to live this human life.\u201d While learning control was a major part of Jessica\u2019s experience, so was learning to summon the voices she heard. Before training as a medium, she heard voices sporadically, she says, and began to hear them every day only after intentionally practicing at the center. Powers and Corlett acknowledge this general trend in their study: The psychics they spoke tended to seek out and cultivate the voice-hearing experiences.\n\nIn her work, Luhrmann has come across groups of people who\u2014unlike Jessica\u2014hear voices only as a result of practice. She gives the example of tulpamancers: people who create tulpas, which are believed to be other beings or personalities that co-exist along inside a person\u2019s mind along with their own. \u201cSomebody in that community estimated to me that one-fifth of the community had frequent voice hearing experiences with their tulpas, that their tulpas talked in a way that was auditory or quasi auditory,\u201d Luhrmann said, a practice that she was told takes two hours a day to develop.\u201cThat\u2019s connected to work. Psychosis is not connected to effort. It happens to people.\u201d Longden, the Hearing Voices Network advocate, describes how she later learned to extract metaphorical meaning from the sometimes disturbing messages the voices had for her. Once when the voices warned her not to leave the house, she thanked them for making her aware that she was feeling unsafe, and firmly reassured the voices\u2014and by extension, herself\u2014that they had nothing to fear. Though Jessica has a different understanding of her voices\u2019 source, it\u2019s hard not to hear echoes of Longden\u2019s account when she speaks about the sense of control she\u2019s developed. Longden talks to the voices as aspects of herself that call for a response, while Jessica addresses them as visitors who need to learn the rules. Instead of tying these experiences to a discrete diagnosis, Powers and Corlett imagine a new kind of frame for voice hearing. Drawing a parallel with Autism Spectrum Disorder, the two are interested in the extent to which the psychics they saw \u201cmight occupy the extreme end of a continuum\u201d of people who hear voices. \u201cMuch of what we perceive and believe about the world is based on our expectations and our beliefs,\u201d Corlett said. \u201cWe can see hallucinations as an exaggeration of that process, and the psychics as a sort of way-station on that continuum, and slowly but surely we can creep towards a better understanding of the clinical case and therefore better treatment. We haven\u2019t had new treatment mechanisms in schizophrenia for many years now.\u201d\n\nThe two freely admit the gaps between their ambitions and what they know so far. The study is preliminary, qualitative work\u2014a follow-up brain-imaging study is in the works\u2014and they did only interview a small number of people. Psychics, they say, are not so easy to come by. Luhrmann speculates that most of the psychics are experiencing something separate from psychosis: \u201cI think it\u2019s also true that there are people who have psychosis who manage it such that they don\u2019t fall ill and avoid this stigma and who really function effectively.\u201d This difference aside, she says, \u201cit may still be possible to learn from people who have more control over their voices. .... to think about how to teach people.\u201d At least as subtext, Powers and Corlett\u2019s study might suggest a kind of chicken-or-egg question: Were the psychics insulated from suffering because they were socialized to accept and cope with their voices, and were the psychotic patients suffering because they weren\u2019t? The better question is: to what extent were the two groups experiencing the same thing? Shinn believes the fact that far fewer diagnosed participants were employed at the time of the study (25 percent, versus 83 percent of the psychics), and that the diagnosed participants experienced more symptoms of psychosis, suggests that they were suffering beyond the point of being useful comparisons. She thinks, rather, that a \u201cconstellation\u201d of symptoms\u2014not just auditory hallucinations or the stigma associated with auditory hallucinations\u2014explain the difference in functionality. \u201cThe Powers study provides interesting results with potentially helpful clinical implications,\u201d she added, \u201cbut they compare very different groups.\u201d", "description": "The ways some \u201chealthy voice hearers\u201d cope might be able to help people with psychotic disorders.", "authors": ["Joseph Frankel"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/06/voices_1/facebook.jpg?1522774913", "published_at": "2017-06-27"}
