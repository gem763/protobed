Instagram/Rihana Petra\n\nAre they divorced \u2013 or aren\u2019t they?\n\nMalaysians might finally get answers around what happened between Sultan Muhammad V and the Russian bride 24 years his junior, after the former model hinted on social media that she was mulling a tell-all.\n\nRihana Oksana Petra addressed the rumors around the couple\u2019s split in an Instagram post on Monday (Sept 2), saying she knew the public wanted a conclusive answer.\n\n\u201cI know that everyone really wants to know what happened to us. Before, I was not ready to reveal my story,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMaybe, if I tell you the truth, I will feel better\u2026 but I just don\u2019t want to hurt anyone,\u201d she added without elaborating. \u201cIt will be painful.\u201d\n\nAccompanying the caption was a cosy wefie of herself and the Sultan, a departure from the professionally-taken pictures of the couple typically posted to her account.\n\nNotably, this is the first time the former Miss Moscow has shown any indication that rumors of their split might be true.\n\nPreviously, she strongly denied the claims, describing her husband as \u201ca decent Muslim\u201d and saying media reports on the topic were \u201cnot legitimate\u201d.\n\nOn Instagram, she has also maintained an image of being in a happy marriage, continuing to recount anecdotes of her romance with the Sultan and post updates on their baby\u2019s development, even as Muhammad V\u2019s lawyer confirmed that Muslim courts had finalised the divorce paperwork.\n\nHis lawyers also appeared to hint that the monarch had doubts over his identity as the baby\u2019s father.\n\nNotably, there are no pictures of the three as a family on Rihana\u2019s account, and mother and baby appear to have been residing in Moscow for an extended period of time.\n\nIn response to the former beauty queen\u2019s latest post, fans \u2013 most of whom believed the couple were indeed divorced \u2013 flooded the comments section with messages of support.\n\nOne commenter referenced the Sultan\u2019s first failed marriage and advised Rihana to \u201cmove on\u201d and \u201cdelete all his photos\u201d, while others said they hoped she would heal from the episode.\n\nSeveral commenters also advised her to keep the details of her marriage secret as a prudent measure.\n\nIf Rihana does reveal her side of the story (she previously promised to, and did, tell fans how the Sultan proposed) it could explain why the Kelantan Palace has never officially recognised the couple\u2019s union or accorded her a title, unlike other foreign brides.\n\nIt could also explain the Sultan\u2019s mysterious and unprecedented abdication of Malaysia\u2019s throne earlier this year \u2013 well before before his term was up. Observers have speculated that the move was linked to his marriage with Rihana.\n\nThe model previously said on Instagram that staying silent would mean conceding to \u201cuntruths\u201d, and that she intended to defend her family\u2019s honour.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - \"Maybe if I tell you the truth, I will feel better,\" she wrote on Instagram..
