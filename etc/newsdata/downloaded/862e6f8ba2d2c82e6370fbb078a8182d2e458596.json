What happened was what Preminger\u2019s Israelis would have called a \u201cbalagan\u201d \u2014 bedlam, chaos, tumult, like trying to conduct a conversation at Times Square when the 1 and the 2 are pulling into the station simultaneously.\n\nOn issue after issue, the candidates engaged in unclear, confusing, halting policy discussions \u2014 that is, when they weren\u2019t engaging in pettifoggery designed to occlude our understanding of their views rather than clarifying them.\n\nIt got so bad that Julian Castro, one of the seven people on the stage who have as much of a chance of becoming president as I do, thought he\u2019d caught out Joe Biden in a candidacy-ending mistake. Hadn\u2019t Biden just said everyone would be forced into Medicare two minutes after saying they could keep their private insurance?\n\nCould Biden not remember what he had said two minutes before?\n\nCastro was playing the senility card against the 76-year-old Biden. But the person who was senile in that moment was the 44 year-old Castro, because Biden had not contradicted himself. Castro had misunderstood Biden.\n\nIt was easy to misunderstand Biden, whose undeniable energy was not matched by clarity. He gave an answer on Afghanistan and Iran that was so confusing Bernie Sanders accused him of opposing the surge in Iraq when he was talking about the surge in Afghanistan. Biden didn\u2019t object to Sanders\u2019 mischaracterization because he might have gotten lost in his own weeds.\n\nSo did Elizabeth Warren, whose words, sentence by sentence, were perfectly clear but whose meaning was not. In a lengthy attack on Trump\u2019s tariffs, she defended Trump\u2019s tariffs. In another assault on Trump\u2019s Afghanistan policy she basically said everything that Trump has said about Afghanistan. Was this deliberate?\n\nAs for Bernie Sanders, the only question I have to ask is this: Will the $30 trillion cost of his health care plan cover some throat lozenges? He spent the entire night needing to clear his throat. It was maddening, though perhaps not as maddening as him screaming at us as though we had just cut him off in traffic.\n\nEvery liberal on Twitter seemed to think Beto O\u2019Rourke is wonderful for saying he\u2019s going to seize everyone\u2019s AR-15. Does it matter that he can\u2019t, Congress won\u2019t, and he\u2019s peddling snake oil?\n\nThe best performance of the night was probably from Cory Booker, who made a couple of good jokes and seemed passionate and calm at the same time, which is what you want from a debate. But it wasn\u2019t the kind of thing that changes the trajectory of a race.\n\nJoe Biden looked strong at the start, flagged in the middle, and then near the end offered a beautiful answer to a question about the setbacks in his life and the resilience he has learned from them. The answer from a man who lost his wife and daughter in a car accident and a 46-year-old son to cancer was simple: \u201cYou find purpose.\u201d\n\nThat came around the two-and-a-half-hour mark, though. How anyone not being paid to watch was still watching is a mystery to me.\n\nWho won? Nobody wins a balagan.\n\njpodhoretz@gmail.com", "description": "As the Democratic debate in Houston entered its third hour last night, I rose from my chair and said, \u201cABC, let the American people go!\u201d And there was no one to cheer, for I was alone in my office.", "authors": ["John Podhoretz", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dem-debate-boring-opinion.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
