Tye Angland had broken his shoulder in a pile-up and a few were out suspended so they were low on jockeys, they asked me if I would stay on to ride for an extra week.\n\nIron Man! @neilcallan78 ends a frustrating run of seconds to secure his first win this season! #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/MbIoGM8abt \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 16, 2019\n\n\u201cI said I\u2019d do it but I didn\u2019t have a Jockey Club phone, I didn\u2019t have an entries sheet. I asked \u2018how am I going to get rides?\u2019 They just said \u2018that\u2019s for you to work out.\u2019\n\n\u201cI sat by the pool in Thailand, I went down through the list of all the trainers and Ricky Yui [Poon-fai] was the only one giving me support at the time, I said to him \u2018look, I am going in blind, I need your help, give me what you can give me\u2019 and he gave me two rides on the day and both of them won.\u201d\n\nThe rest is now history for Callan who admits he had been thinking back to his early days in Hong Kong before Wednesday night\u2019s heroics.\n\nHong Kong trainers and owners can be fickle and often want the \u201cbig name\u201d jockey on their horse, but Callan\u2019s lesson in persistence earlier this decade helped him out of his rut this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll never forget when I was going to the airport with [wife] Trish that night I said \u2018these trainers can help you if they want, I am coming back\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI came back the next year and rode seven or eight winners then I was full-time after that. I finished third in my first full season.\n\n\u201cThat is what made me determined to come back, knowing that if trainers want to help you, they can and now I am thinking the same thing, it is like going back to square one because I am struggling for rides again.\n\n\u201cMy mindset then is what it is now because I have been put right back down so it only makes me more determined to push them because I know they can help me if they want to and hopefully this is a kick-start to that.\u201d\n\nOne of the quirks in Hong Kong racing is the role luck plays, especially with the local owners \u2013 they are often reluctant to put a jockey on their horse if they are not seen as a \u201cwinner\u201d no matter how well they might be riding.\n\nCallan, who believed he was not riding poorly during his run of outs, said while it maybe difficult to come to terms with the local mindset early on, it is essential to accept it and move on.\n\n\u201cWhen in Rome you do as the Romans do, so if they say you have to go to the temple, just go to the temple. If they say you have to put a fish tank in your living room, put a fish tank in your living room, just do it,\u201d he laughed.\n\nWith Callan up and going in season 2019-20, it leaves Umberto Rispoli, Lyle Hewitson, Ben So Tik-hung and Alex Lai Hoi-wing the only riders left without a win.", "description": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing.
