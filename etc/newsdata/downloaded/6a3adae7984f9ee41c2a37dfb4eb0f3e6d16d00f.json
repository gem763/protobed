If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nHoliday shopping is already well underway\u2014but knowing what to get everyone on your list (and more importantly, what to buy before they're gone) can be tough. To help you give the best presents, we've rounded up what we predict will be the top 10 gifts of 2019.\n\nPsst: Some of these are on the list of things to buy before Black Friday just in case they sell out.\n\n1. Amazon Echo\n\nHey Alexa, what should I get everyone on my list this year? (Photo: Reviewed.com/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nSmart speakers continue to be hot buy for the 2019 holidays\u2014but which one should you choose?

It has amazing sound quality and far-field voice recognition so Alexa can hear you even from another room.\n\nGet the Amazon Echo (2nd Generation) from Amazon for $69.99\n\n2. Instant Pot Ultra\n\nThe Ultra even comes with pre-programmed recipes.

Of all the Instant Pots we've tested, we like the Instant Pot Ultra the best because it has so many different functions (it can do everything from pressure cook, to steam, to slow cook) and has an updated interface that shows your food's progress.\n\nGet the Instant Pot Ultra 10-in-1 Pressure Cooker from Amazon for $109\n\n3.

One of our editors put it to the test to see if the stylish suitcase lives up to the hype. Her verdict? It definitely does. Away luggage not only comes in an array of pretty colors, but is both durable and easy to maneuver through crowded airports.\n\nGet the Away Carry-On for $225 at Away Travel\n\n4. KitchenAid Stand Mixer\n\nBlending, kneading, whipping...the KitchenAid does it all.

Not surprisingly, our experts chose it as the number one stand mixer because it consistently performs better than other models. It also has a variety of attachments that you can easily use with the base, so you can do everything from make fresh pasta to knead bread dough.\n\nGet the KitchenAid Artisan 5-Quart Stand Mixer from Amazon for $299.95\n\n5. A weighted blanket\n\nChoose 15, 20, or 25 pounds for the Gravity Blanket.

They're all the rage right now because they're said to be super comfortable, reduce stress, and even help you fall asleep faster. We tried some of the top-rated weighted blankets and found that the Gravity Blanket provided just the right amount of pressure and feels extremely luxurious.\n\nGet the Gravity Blanket from Amazon for $249\n\n6. Fitbit Versa 2\n\nThe Versa 2 comes in 6 stylish colors. (Photo: Fitbit)\n\nIf anyone on your list doesn't yet have a fitness tracker, gift them the Fitbit Versa 2. Fitbit has long been the go-to brand for fitness trackers (we named the Fitbit Charge our number one tracker of the year!) because the bands are comfortable, easy to use, and have a long battery life. The Versa 2 tracks everything from heart rate, to steps, to sleep quality.\n\nGet the FitBit Versa 2 from Amazon for $199.95\n\n7.

Bonus: the Paperwhite is even waterproof.\n\nGet the Kindle Paperwhite from Amazon for $149.99\n\n8. Apple AirPods\n\nAirPods sound better than their other wireless counterparts.
