They include: Eversmart, Solarplicity, Brilliant Energy, Extra Energy, Spark Energy, Future Energy, National Gas and Power, Iresa Energy, Gen4U, Usio Energy, One Select, Our Power and Economy Energy.\n\nMark Gutteridge, managing director of switching website Flipper, said: 'It's so disappointing that fewer people are switching away from the big suppliers and there has been a significant increase in the number of customers returning to a large provider.\n\n'The fact that so many consumers are now prepared to swap savings for security shows they have lost trust in smaller energy suppliers.'\n\nHe adds: 'Ofgem should be ashamed of these figures as they are a direct result of their inaction on tightening rules for suppliers and many households will now pay more for their energy rather than risk being with a supplier who they worry may fail.'\n\nThe total number of electricity switches is now up to 4,741,454 so far in 2019, up 11 per cent on the same time last year when a record 5.8million customers switched supplier, according to Energy UK - a trade association for the industry.\n\nAlthough the net gain in customers by smaller suppliers since May this year is 563,000, this figure was nearly 1million, highlighting the dramatic decrease in people moving to smaller providers.\n\nThe report also revealed that switches from large to small suppliers were up just three per cent from the year to date but down 17 per cent year on year since May again suggesting that more and more customers are moving away from smaller firms.\n\nHowever, regulator Ofgem - and its recent state of the market report - revealed that, since June 2018, the six large suppliers had a net loss as a group of around 1.3million customers.\n\nBy June 2019, they served just above 70 per cent of domestic customers, but this trend could now be reversing.\n\nThis graph shows how many households have switched to larger or smaller suppliers in 2 years\n\nCordelia Samson, energy expert at uSwitch, said: 'Households aren't content to just sit on poor value standard deals and pay over the odds for their energy.\n\n'Instead they're voting with their feet by moving to cheaper tariffs and better service.\n\n'After the huge numbers of customers who have moved away from the Big Six suppliers in the past couple of years, 2019 has seen more consumers gradually start to return.\n\n'There have been some very competitive deals for under \u00a31,000 a year available from the larger suppliers recently, while households are likely to be more cautious about switching to one of the tiny challenger brands as a number of them have gone out of business in the past year.\n\n'The Big Six are continuing to lose customers, with a higher proportion of consumers switching away than are moving to them, but their customer numbers may be beginning to stabilise somewhat after a turbulent few years.'\n\nThe news comes after Ofgem revealed that energy suppliers will soon face tough new reforms, aimed at improving customer service standards and reducing the risk of failure.\n\nMany customers reported suffering from a lack of organisation and resources when a supplier has gone bust.\n\nThe watchdog said the proposals will ensure fast growing energy firms can demonstrate they are able to take on additional customers effectively and meet industry obligations while also remaining financially viable.\n\nCustomers who are stuck on a standard variable tariff or believe they are overpaying on their energy bills are encouraged to use a price comparison service to see if they could save money by switching providers or changing plans.\n\nLawrence Slade, chief executive at Energy UK said: 'Customers, whatever their circumstances, can benefit from checking their tariff so if you're concerned about your bill going into winter, pick up the phone to your supplier and see if you're on the best deal - or have a look at what other offers are available in the market.'", "description": "Switches from small suppliers back to large ones are up 37% annually  and 61% year-on-year since May, according to figures from trade association Energy UK.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
