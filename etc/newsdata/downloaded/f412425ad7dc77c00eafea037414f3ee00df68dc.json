In late August, the Delray Beach, Florida, native took down both Anastasia Potapova and Timea Babos at the US Open before reaching the third round and falling to world No. 1 Naomi Osaka in straight sets. She then ran the table at Upper Austria Ladies Linz in October, defeating four top-100 players \u2013 including then-world No.8 Kiki Bertens \u2013 en route to her first World Tennis Association (WTA) title.\n\nAt her age, neither Venus nor Serena Williams had achieved the same feat.\n\nGauff\u2019s rapid success has put the world of tennis on notice, and her rankings have reflected that ascent. After starting the year at No. 685 in the WTA rankings, the teen has climbed into the top-100 at No. 71.\n\nJanuary 2019: No. 685\n\nOctober 2019: No. 71 What a year. ????\n\nCongratulations, @CocoGauff. pic.twitter.com/TdqdmxY5sj \u2014 Tennis Channel (@TennisChannel) October 14, 2019\n\nGauff herself may have put it best to reporters after her victory in Linz: \u201cThis was definitely not on the calendar at the beginning of the year.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been all smooth sailing for Gauff, who lost in straight sets in the first round of the Citi Open back in late July. She also dropped her opening match at the BGL BNP Paribas Luxembourg Open to world No. 66 Anna Blinkova.\n\nRead more: Simone Biles is the most dominant athlete on the planet, and now she\u2019s primed to become the most accomplished Olympian of all time\n\nYou could chalk Gauff\u2019s early exits up to growing pains, but famed tennis coach Patrick Mouratoglou \u2013 who has taken on Gauff as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 but is best known for coaching Serena Williams \u2013 is directing blame elsewhere.\n\ncaption Coco Gauff at the 2019 US Open. source Emilee Chin/Getty Images\n\nDue to a WTA rule designed to prevent players who are less than 16 years old from overextending themselves, Gauff is only eligible to compete in 14 tournaments before her next birthday. Mouratoglou believes that abiding by these regulations has stymied Gauff\u2019s growth as a player and that she could more quickly overcome her early-career jitters with more exposure on the court.\n\n\u201cYou have to consider that when it\u2019s the right momentum, it\u2019s the right momentum,\u201d Mouratoglou told The Daily Mail.\n\nGauff turns 16 in March of 2020, and since she\u2019s already competed in 12 tournaments this year, she won\u2019t have much flexibility in the way of elite competition for the next few months.\n\n\u201cThis is going to slow her down for sure,\u201d Mouratoglou said. \u201cYou are basically preventing young players from doing their job.\u201d\n\ncaption Coco Gauff competes at Wimbledon in 2019. source Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images\n\nStill, Mouratoglou and a slew of other tennis elites believe in Gauff\u2019s potential. Mouratoglou described her as \u201cimpressive in all aspects,\u201d while Serena Williams told Tennis.com that \u201csoon she\u2019ll be on other girls\u2019 walls.\u201d\n\nOn the men\u2019s side of the net, Roger Federer said Gauff \u201cwanted to be on the big court\u2026 Good players, that\u2019s where they shine, I\u2019d say.\u201d\n\nNick Kyrgios, meanwhile, described the budding star as \u201cthe real deal\u201d and said, \u201cshe\u2019s going to have the potential to do some amazing things in this sport.\u201d\n\nHaving already faced some of the sport\u2019s top contenders and with so many big names showing confidence in her abilities, it\u2019s just a matter of time before Gauff blossoms into the heir apparent to Serena Williams\u2019 throne that she is oft thought to be.", "description": "Business Insider - After winning her first WTA title this week, Coco Gauff launched into the top 100 of the WTA rankings for the first time in her young career..
