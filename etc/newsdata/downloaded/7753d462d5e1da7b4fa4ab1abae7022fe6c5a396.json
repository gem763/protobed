When central banks are \u201cbuying as heavily as they are, it provides cover and a rationale for other central banks to do the same.\u201d\n\nRussian central bank gold reserves stand at 2,219.2 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council, or WGC, based on the latest data available in September from sources including the International Monetary Fund. China\u2019s holdings are at 1,936.5 metric tons.\n\nGiven the latest prices, with the most-active gold futures contract GCZ19, -0.54% settling at $1,499.50 an ounce on Friday, and about 32,151 troy ounces in one metric ton, the value of Russia\u2019s gold reserves is at roughly $107 billion.\n\nThe moves are due to concerns about the outlook for currencies, including the dollar and the euro, says Mark O\u2019Byrne, research director at GoldCore in Dublin. \u201cWhile the gold tonnage demand from central banks in recent months has been significant and near records, gold remains a tiny fraction of most central banks\u2019...foreign-exchange reserves,\u201d he says, adding that the trend is \u201csustainable and indeed may accelerate.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Byrne added that the risk of the trade war descending into a currency war may also be feeding central bank diversification into gold.\n\nCentral banks had a record first half of the year, collectively buying 374 metric tons of gold through June, says Juan Carlos Artigas, director of investment research at the WGC. That was the highest first half of the year since central banks became net buyers in 2010. Net purchases from central banks year to date are still below those of 2018, but with the significant level of central bank purchases this year, \u201cwe will likely be above the 10-year average,\u201d says Artigas.\n\nThe price of gold, which has climbed to six-year highs on and off since June, hasn\u2019t hurt that appetite for the precious metal. Gold futures settled at $1,560.40 on Sept. 4, the highest finish since April 2013.\n\n\u201cPrice is not the determining factor in central bank buying\u2014rather, [the banks] are more likely being guided to secure an allocation of a percentage of their overall foreign-exchange reserves in gold bullion,\u201d says O\u2019Byrne. The central bank diversification and hedging are likely to support gold at these levels and could be a driver of higher prices in the coming months, he says.\n\nThe WGC reported that gold holdings in Russia represent 19.6% of its total foreign reserves, while gold holdings are a mere 2.8% share of China\u2019s total foreign reserves. \u201cChina and Russia are obviously intent on insulating themselves from a dollarized global economy, and gold seems to be a very important part of that strategy,\u201d Lundin says. \u201cWhile gold still represents a relatively small portion of China\u2019s total foreign reserves...[the Chinese] seem to feel that gold will become more valuable over time, while the dollar will become less so.\u201d\n\nThe rush of central bank gold buying doesn\u2019t say much about where near-term prices of gold are headed, but it does say \u201ca lot about where it\u2019s going over the long term, or at least where the banks believe it\u2019s going,\u201d Lundin says.", "description": "Emerging markets have beefed up gold holdings, undeterred by prices near their highest levels in more than six years, as countries such as Russia and China...", "authors": ["Myra P.
