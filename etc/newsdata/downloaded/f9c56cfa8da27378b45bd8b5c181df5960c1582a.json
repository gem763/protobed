Arraez hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Drew VerHagen (4-3), who had combined with Daniel Norris to shut out the Twins until then. Nelson Cruz added an RBI single in the eighth, and Rosario\u2019s two-run shot that inning made it 5-1.\n\nMinnesota (98-60) is on the verge of winning its first AL Central title since 2010 and has its highest victory total since the 1970 team also won 98 games. The Tigers (46-111) are assured of baseball\u2019s worst record and the No. 1 pick in next year\u2019s draft.\n\nMiguel Cabrera lumbered around from first to score the game\u2019s first run on Jeimer Candelario\u2019s double. The 36-year-old Cabrera, playing for the first time since Friday, was able to slide home just ahead of the relay. Cabrera had reached on an error by shortstop Jorge Polanco.\n\nDaniel Norris went three innings for the Tigers, allowing two hits and striking out five. VerHagen relieved him and pitched 4 1/3 innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nTwins: RP Sam Dyson is out for the season after having shoulder surgery Tuesday. \u2026 C Mitch Garver (right hip) played for the first time since Sunday and struck out four times. \u2026 3B Marwin Gonzalez (oblique tightness) missed a second straight game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nTwins: Minnesota had not yet announced a starter for Thursday\u2019s series finale at Detroit.\n\nTigers: Jordan Zimmermann (1-12) takes the mound in Detroit\u2019s home finale.\n\n___\n\nFollow Noah Trister at https://twitter.com/noahtrister\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Randy Dobnak allowed one hit in six sparkling innings, and Luis Arraez and Eddie Rosario homered to lead Minnesota to a 5-1 win over Detroit that put the Twins on the cusp of an AL Central title Wednesday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Noah Trister"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/twins_tigers_baseball_68949_c0-185-4433-2769_s1770x1032.jpg?f4971098594447f637e3ffea6d8171e7e895a2aa", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
