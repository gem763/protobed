That\u2019s why he\u2019s so important for us,\u201d Guardiola told a news conference.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have many choices... he\u2019s the only one I have. Other players can play in that position but Fernandinho is a clever player, so intelligent \u2014 an incredible guy.\n\n\u201cHe has a lot of experience and personality and what he says the people follow him in the locker room so it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nA tough tackler with natural passing ability, Fernandinho is the ideal player to slot into defence in Guardiola\u2019s system and has emerged as a potential replacement for former club captain Vincent Kompany who departed at the end of last season.\n\nThe Brazilian is unlikely to get any quicker in the twilight of his career and is aware that a redefined role could ensure more playing time at the Premier League champions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been training in this position since the start of the season,\u201d said Fernandinho, who made two interceptions and had a passing accuracy of 90% against Shakhtar.\n\n\u201cToday was my opportunity, I hope I can improve. It was a quiet night at the back but the team have made a very good game... because we played as a team.\u201d", "description": "Manchester City midfielder Fernandinho has the personality and experience to solve their injury crisis in defence, manager Pep Guardiola has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431463848&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I083", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
