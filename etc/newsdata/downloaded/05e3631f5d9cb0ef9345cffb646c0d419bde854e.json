But the company\u2019s profits weren\u2019t the result of a massive windfall in its cannabis business, instead coming from Aphria\u2019s previously sliding stock price and a shift in its ownership stake in another company.\n\nU.S.-traded shares of Aphria APHA, +24.54% APHA, +15.46% closed Tuesday\u2019s regular session with a 24% gain, but had previously fallen just over 6% in the quarter it reported Tuesday. The fluctuations in Aphria\u2019s share price leading up to Tuesday\u2019s report boosted the company\u2019s earnings by C$14.2 million because of the way the Canadian cannabis company values its convertible debt.\n\nValuing the convertible debenture relates directly to the company\u2019s share price, which closed at $6.26 at the end of August, though it traded as low as $5.02 before it reported its fiscal fourth-quarter results.\n\nRead: Cannabis companies have secret formulas to determine when the U.S. may allow pot sales\n\nAnother paper gain that helped push Aphria into the black for the quarter was an arcane change in accounting methods it uses to value its investment in Althea Group Holdings Ltd. AGH, -1.55% . Aphria reduced its ownership stake and gave up its board seat and \u201cability to participate in Althea\u2019s policy-making process\u201d during the quarter, which allowed management to book profits of C$24.3 million, which it included as paper gains in its long-term investments.\n\nCombined with the changes in value assigned to its convertible debentures, Aphria added roughly $30 million in paper gains to arrive at the profitable quarter.\n\nCannabis revenue itself rose to C$30.8 million from C$28.6 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. The company disclosed that an August fire at its Broken Coast operation in British Columbia \u2014 which Chief Executive Irwin Simon has previously called its highest-margin business \u2014 had a C$1.5 million impact that \u201cwould be made up in the balance of the year,\u201d executives said in Tuesday\u2019s earnings conference call. Aphria did not disclose the cause of the blaze in the call.\n\nExecutives also reiterated the company\u2019s fiscal 2020 guidance of C$650 million to C$700 million in revenue, \u201cslightly more than half\u201d of which will come from the company\u2019s CC Pharma drug distribution business. Chief Financial Officer Carl Merton said on the conference call that Aphria expects \u201cannualized\u201d Canadian marijuana revenue of $1 billion by the end of calendar year 2020 (Aphria\u2019s fiscal year-end occurs in May).\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Mitch McConnell meets with pot execs in California, pitched need for cannabis banking reform\n\nSeaport Global Securities analyst Brett Hundley called Tuesday\u2019s results \u201csolid\u201d amid a \u201cmarketplace that badly needed positive data points.\u201d Hundley is referring to a broad decline in the sector over the past several trading days, spurred by a revenue warning issued by Hexo Corp. HEXO, +8.47% HEXO, +0.60% last week.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the company is optimistic regarding FY2020 guidance, and we leave our forward estimates well short of its forecast, as a result,\u201d Hundley, who has an C$8 target price and a buy rating on the name, wrote in a Tuesday note. \u201cThat said, we think this is a company that is armed and ready to prove us wrong, while also being appropriately positioned should we ourselves prove to be right.\u201d\n\nGMP Securities analyst Justin Keywood also wrote in a note to clients that Aphria\u2019s results were \u201csolid,\u201d and that they lined up with the \u201cscuttlebutt\u201d that his team had been hearing about improvements to operations and customer loyalty, among other things.\n\nJefferies analysts Owen Bennett called the results \u201cstrong\u201d and said in a note to clients that most promising from the earnings were Aphria\u2019s gains in market share \u2014 executives in the conference call said it had captured a 12% share in Ontario \u2014 coupled with continued profitability and reiteration of its sales guidance. Bennett has a buy on the name with a C$11 price target.\n\nAphria shares have fallen 65% in the past year, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.00% has gained 7.8%. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ, +6.57% , which tracks a basket of cannabis stocks, among other names, has fallen 53% in the past year. Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences Index ETF HMMJ, +5.12% has dropped 55% in the past year.\n\nCheck out: Cannabis Watch \u2014 All of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies", "description": "Aphria Inc.\u2019s profits are about the paper, not the pot.", "authors": ["Max A.
