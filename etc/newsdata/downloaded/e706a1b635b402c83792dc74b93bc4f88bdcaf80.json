They had previously found that the stocks of family-owned businesses tend to generate above-average returns.\n\nAgain, they found that a greater number of female executives was correlated with better share price performance over the past 10 years.\n\nGiving an example of what they called \u201cstriking results\u201d, the researchers write: \u201cOver the past five years, family-owned companies with at least one female executive have outperformed male-only family-owned companies in every year.\u201d\n\nThe report also reveals that family-owned firms with a substantial number of female executives shine when it comes to revenue growth and profit margins, and they have a lower reliance on debt.\n\nThe research adds to earlier findings on the effects of gender diversity at companies. For example, Rebecca Moss at the University of Nottingham has found that female board directors significantly improve banks\u2019 performance during a financial crisis. To assess performance, Ms Moss used both a stock-based measure and an accounting-based gauge.\n\nThese results provide support for the business case for more female directors, \u201cespecially within high-risk environments\u201d, she argued.\n\nCredit Suisse researchers also conducted a survey of 120 family-owned companies in over 10 countries and discovered that a bigger share of female executives results in a greater tendency to \u201cdo good\u201d \u2013 by focusing on things like the company\u2019s environmental impact, workers\u2019 well-being and corporate governance.", "description": "The shares of companies with more female managers deliver higher returns, while a greater number of female executives is also correlated with stronger revenue growth and higher profit margins, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Olesya Dmitracova"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/08/31/18/boardroom.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
