It is for money, of course, and ostensibly for the love of a story that a creator wants to inhabit so fully that the only thing they can do is tell it again themselves. Adaptations can be for ownership \u2014 there are adaptations that claim or reclaim characters and narratives. Adaptations can also be for improvement; the recent Looking for Alaska miniseries is a great example of how adapting a work can make it even more of what it should\u2019ve been from the jump.\n\nWhether an adaptation goes in with a sense of its own purpose is one of those things you can feel as a viewer. You can feel it even if you\u2019re not sure what the purpose is, or if the purpose is nothing more than \u201cI truly love this story and I want to tell it again.\u201d You can also tell when an adaptation\u2019s reason for being has been so sanded down and defanged and jumbled and depressurized that it now feels a little empty. This, sadly, is what\u2019s happened to His Dark Materials.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad show, and it\u2019s important to note that many of its flaws are things that the series could still overcome in later episodes. It\u2019s also worth noting that in spite of the series\u2019s missteps so far, I am still absolutely planning to watch the rest of the season, and undoubtedly the whole second season that\u2019s already begun filming. I can\u2019t help it; it was destined from the moment I missed an entrance in my summer drama camp performance of Carousel because I was reading The Golden Compass backstage. But His Dark Materials\u2019 first episodes are a mixture of unabashedly gorgeous visuals, several strong performances, and writing that demonstrates time and again that it has no confidence in either of those things.\n\nThe world Philip Pullman built for the original His Dark Materials book trilogy is full of complicated metaphysical and institutional structures. There\u2019s a high-level mythology that seeps down into the fiction and informs every detail of the world where his preteen orphan protagonist Lyra Belacqua lives. At the beginning of the story, Lyra, played in the series by Dafne Keen, is a ward at Jordan College, a fictional college at Oxford in a world that looks a lot like ours but very distinctly is not. Chief among the differences: All humans are accompanied by their daemons, something like animal embodiments of their souls. The government is controlled by a shadowy religious institution called the Magisterium. Lyra\u2019s Uncle Asriel (played by James McAvoy) is deeply focused on something she doesn\u2019t understand and many adults seem to fear, something called Dust.\n\nAll of that\u2019s also the case for HBO\u2019s series. But at the start of The Golden Compass, Pullman\u2019s first book in the trilogy, even those few bits of world-building aren\u2019t made all that clear. It is a trilogy about Lyra\u2019s coming-of-age, about what kind of person she\u2019s going to be, and about how to define goodness. In the process, a lot about her world slowly comes into focus \u2014 the Magisterium, the daemons, big ideas about good and evil and the nature of reality. But none of it shows up until it has meaning for Lyra, which means none of it shows up until it\u2019s already part of the narrative stakes. Everything stays a mystery until there\u2019s a reason to care about knowing it.\n\nHBO\u2019s series seems to be operating from a place where all things need to be explained instantly, long before the viewer has any reason to understand why they\u2019re worth knowing. The daemon CGI is incredibly impressive, but the point of having daemons at all, at least in the opening, seems to mostly be that they\u2019re a useful way to get characters to say exposition out loud. Everything alluded to by the setting or the mood of a scene is quickly explained in the simplest possible language. The pace feels both lickety-split fast and strangely plodding, because the first four episodes cover swooping changes in Lyra\u2019s life where people yell story at one another and then leave before anyone has a chance to feel the emotional impact of whatever was just revealed.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating not just because the writing often feels so clunky, but also because the series\u2019s visual design is so persuasively lovely. I kept wishing characters would just stop talking so that the images could be allowed to carry the mood without getting undercut by topic-line-style dialogue about what\u2019s happening. The constant explaining also makes Lyra feel reactive rather than driven, as though she\u2019s being swept along with events rather than pushing them forward herself. The over-exposition has the counterintuitive impact of somehow making things even more confusing. There\u2019s so much information, so many bits and bobs of background information that arrive unmoored to any particular motive, that it\u2019s easy to lose track of the central thread.\n\nThat said, Ruth Wilson\u2019s Mrs. Coulter is exactly what that character should be: painfully beautiful and dangerous and churning with intensity. The world itself is stunning, especially the Gyptians\u2019 boats, the northern town of Trollesund, and Mrs. Coulter\u2019s gorgeous prison of an apartment. I\u2019ll admit to having been a little worried about Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee Scoresby (it\u2019s hard to see LMM as anything other than himself!), but he\u2019s both magnetic and completely persuasive as the intrepid balloon-flying mercenary cowboy.\n\nNo matter how much the story gets overexplained, though, its foundation is so compelling that bits of it will likely grab viewers anyhow, if only for the opportunity to watch this world unfurl. But as an adaptation, His Dark Materials has yet to convince me that it knows what it\u2019s for, other than the challenge of making everyone\u2019s daemons seem plausible. It does not feel confident in its own endeavor, and it doesn\u2019t seem particularly interested in the deeper questions of identity and existential uncertainty. What it\u2019s definitely for, if nothing else, is the sheer spectacle of Philip Pullman\u2019s universe. That, at least, is wildly successful.", "description": "A review of His Dark Materials, HBO\u2019s new adaptation series of Philip Pullman\u2019s trilogy, beginning with The Golden Compass, and starring Dafne Keen as Lyra, James McAvoy as Asriel, Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Coulter, and Lin-Manuel Miranda as Lee Scoresby.", "authors": ["Kathryn Vanarendonk"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/30/30-his-dark-materials-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
