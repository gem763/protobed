Putin and the Saudi royal family, in a highly classified computer system after embarrassing leaks of his conversations, according to current and former officials\u2026\n\nThe latest revelations show the focus that White House officials put on safeguarding not only classified information but also delicate calls with Mr. Trump, the details of which the administration did not want leaked\u2026\n\nIn the case of the calls with the Saudi royal family, the restrictions were set beforehand, and the number of people allowed to listen was sharply restricted. The Saudi calls placed in the restricted system were with King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prince Khalid bin Salman, who at the time was the Saudi ambassador to the United States\u2026\n\nThe practice began after details of Mr. Trump\u2019s Oval Office discussion with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, leaked to the news media, leading to questions of whether the president had released classified information, according to multiple current and former officials. The White House was particularly upset when the news media reported that Mr. Trump had called James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, a \u201cnut job\u201d during that same meeting, according to current and former officials.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Nsc-Ukraine-Call.Html"], "top_image": ""}
