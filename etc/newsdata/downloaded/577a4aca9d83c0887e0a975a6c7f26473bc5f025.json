Too bad she\u2019s a hypocrite.", "language": "en", "text": "First, because she transferred $10.4 million from her Senate reelection campaign to her presidential campaign fund. More than $6 million came in contributions of $1,000 and up, as the New York Times recently noted. The senator appears to be trying to have it both ways \u2014 get the political upside from eschewing donations from higher-level donors and running a grass-roots campaign, while at the same time using money obtained from those donors in 2018.\n\nThe $10.4 million gave Warren a substantial head start in building a presidential-campaign staff and doing other things for which money is essential. If she wasn\u2019t being hypocritical, she would have taken only the dollars raised in smaller increments from her Senate race and transferred those into her presidential account.\n\nSecond, Warren attacked former vice president Joe Biden for holding a kickoff fundraiser in Philadelphia in April, which she criticized as \u201ca swanky private fund-raiser for wealthy donors\u201d in an email to supporters the next day.\n\nWell, I helped organize that affair, and I thought her attack was extremely hypocritical because nearly 20 of us who attended the Biden fundraiser had also given her $2,000 or more in 2018 at closed-door fundraisers in \u201cswanky\u201d locations.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ed Rendell", "Beta.Washingtonpost.Com Opinions I-Like-Elizabeth-Warren-Too-Bad-Shes-A-Hypocrite"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
