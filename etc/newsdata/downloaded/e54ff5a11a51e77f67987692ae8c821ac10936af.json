He argued that although voters approved of Clinton\u2019s job performance, they disapproved of his personal behavior \u2014 and that damaged Al Gore\u2019s campaign.\n\nLeonhardt argues that the lesson is that impeachment \u2014 which indicts Trump for and draws attention to his unethical behavior \u2014 will hurt him at the polls in 2020, regardless of how the Senate votes.\n\nAD\n\nIs he right about the evidence from 2000? My research supports Leonhardt\u2019s conclusion: Survey evidence strongly shows that Clinton was an albatross for the Gore campaign. I\u2019ll explain below.\n\nAD\n\nGore ran from Clinton\u2019s reputation in his campaign. Clinton thought his record would have been an asset.\n\nIn November 2000, shortly after Al Gore conceded defeat, he and Clinton had a contentious meeting blaming each other for the Democrats\u2019 loss of the White House, according to Washington Post reporting. Gore had failed to involve Clinton in the 2000 campaign and had even been reluctant to invoke the administration\u2019s record. He viewed Clinton\u2019s personal misbehavior as a serious and inescapable problem.\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s hard, now, to fathom how much the Lewinsky scandal and Ken Starr\u2019s detailed report damaged Clinton\u2019s character ratings. The 2000 American National Election Study (ANES) found that an astonishing 70 percent of voters said the term \u201cdishonest\u201d described Bill Clinton either extremely well or quite well; only 19 percent felt that about George W. Bush. If Clinton was distrusted, how would it have helped the Gore campaign to get his public blessing? To make matters worse, only 12 percent of voters said Clinton was \u201cmoral,\u201d a major problem in an era when major candidates ran heavily on \u201cfamily values.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Gore\u2019s decision to distance himself from the administration irked the outgoing president. Clinton thought he\u2019d left Gore a good shot at victory, with a booming U.S. economy. And he thought he could have turned the tide if Gore had let him campaign. Despite the public distaste for him personally, Clinton thought that he\u2019d have been an asset, given high public approval ratings for his job performance.\n\nWhich one of them was right?\n\nANES offers a good measure of overall public attitudes in its 0-100 \u201cfeeling thermometer.\u201d Comparing candidates\u2019 feeling thermometer ratings is an excellent predictor of voting behavior; Americans almost always vote for the candidate that they\u2019ve given the higher thermometer rating to. The figure below presents simulations for how Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan, Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, as they left office, would have fared against the opposing party\u2019s nominee to replace them, using these thermometer ratings at that time.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry hurt Clinton \u2014 and probably tarnished Gore as well\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe results support Gore\u2019s decision to minimize his association with Clinton. A Clinton-Bush 2000 matchup would have been close. But in reality, Gore beat Bush in the popular vote \u2014 and Clinton would have failed to do so. By this measure, Clinton was clearly less of a liability than LBJ was against Nixon in 1968, or than George W. Bush was against Obama in 2008.\n\nBut even though Clinton\u2019s job approval ratings in 2000 were nearly identical to Reagan\u2019s in 1988, he was not the same kind of electoral asset. Nor was Clinton the asset that Obama was to Hillary Clinton in 2016. The whole scandal \u2014 from the first news of the affair, to the special prosecutor\u2019s damaging report, to the impeachment vote, and finally to the Senate trial, all damaged Clinton\u2019s image. Even a not-guilty verdict in the Senate couldn\u2019t erase the stain on Clinton, and by association the Democrats.\n\nOf course, we can\u2019t automatically assume that Clinton\u2019s integrity affected how Americans voted in 2000. After all, he wasn\u2019t on the ballot. But I used a multivariate model of the 2000 vote \u2014 and found that how Americans responded to a question about Clinton\u2019s impact on the nation\u2019s moral climate were strongly related to how they voted, even after controlling for a variety of other factors. In fact, this had a greater influence on voting than responses to a similarly worded question about Clinton\u2019s impact on the economy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn short, George W. Bush\u2019s strategy of repeatedly pledging to \u201crestore dignity and honor to the White House\u201d worked as intended.\n\nSo what\u2019s the real lesson from Clinton\u2019s impeachment?\n\nAs Leonhardt argues, impeachment without a conviction nevertheless aids the opposition party by throwing a spotlight on the incumbent\u2019s misdeeds in office. By changing the focus from economic performance to personal integrity, the Republicans put themselves in a much better position to win in 2000. Even if all the current impeachment inquiry succeeds in doing is drawing attention to Trump\u2019s faults, it should still help the Democrats in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nMartin Wattenberg is professor of political science at the University of California at Irvine and author of \u201cIs Voting for Young People?\u201d (Routledge, 2016).\n\nAD\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "It didn\u2019t help Bill Clinton.", "authors": ["Martin Wattenberg"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eIdOZVpeqg4XhQTKp1pnJBCmq1s=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IDZIDPHV34I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
