She\u2019s a good person and she\u2019s had a tough time. Now she\u2019s got a baby and I only wish her well.\u2019\n\nPerhaps the \u2018tough time\u2019 Louis is referring to is Cheryl\u2019s split from boyfriend Liam Payne last year. The couple dated for two years and share two-year-old son Bear, although they are thought to be parenting amicably.\n\nLiam, 26, has since moved on and is now dating model Maya Henry while Cheryl is believed to be single.\n\nLouis\u2019 got a lot of love for Cheryl (Picture: Getty/Rex/Metro.co.uk)\n\nLouis\u2019 kind comments about Cheryl are a stark contrast to his earlier mocking of her singing talents.\n\nThe X Factor judge joked about the possibility of having Cheryl compete in the new celebrity version of the ITV series: \u2018You mean as a contestant? She would be good. She could even win it.\n\n\u2018Cheryl doesn\u2019t mime. It\u2019s called lip-syncing.\u2019\n\nElsewhere in his chat with Richard, Louis made a cheeky quip about Sharon Osbourne\u2019s cosmetic surgery.\n\nWhile discussing Sharon\u2019s absence from the X Factor: Celebrity judging panel, Louis joked: \u2018I would have loved Sharon Osbourne but she\u2019s getting a new face. It\u2019s supposed to be the best one yet.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018Don\u2019t go to Simon\u2019s [surgeon], go to Sharon\u2019s.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
