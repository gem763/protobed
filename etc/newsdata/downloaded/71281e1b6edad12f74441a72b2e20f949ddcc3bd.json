But only one has managed to alienate many of his colleagues, fuel the paranoia of Fox News viewers, and inadvertently play a key role in the whistleblower complaint and President Donald Trump\u2019s potential impeachment.\n\nOver the past several years, John Solomon, a long-time journalist with bylines at the Washington Post, the Associated Press, and Newsweek/The Daily Beast, has pivoted to becoming the Trumpian right\u2019s favorite \u201cinvestigative reporter.\u201d\n\nAnd now, thanks to several mentions in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, his work has come under intense scrutiny following the revelation that a series of his stories about Ukraine, along with his Fox News appearances promoting them, may have led to the president asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to team up with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani to investigate the Biden family.\n\nOver the past several months, and with the benefit of substantial airtime from Fox News primetime host Sean Hannity, Solomon has peddled a series of Ukraine-based conspiracy theories and allegations that have primarily taken aim at two of Trumpworld\u2019s biggest targets: Biden and Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn the process, his questionable reporting, which often seems specifically tailored to stoke the flames of right-wing paranoia, has enraged many of his colleagues at The Hill who have for years seen his tactics and reporting as overtly ideological, convoluted, and often lacking in crucial context.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a lightning rod of anxiety for us,\u201d one Hill insider told The Daily Beast.\n\nHired away from now-defunct news site Circa in 2017 to help launch The Hill\u2019s over-the-top streaming service Hill TV, Solomon split his time between digital video strategy and running his own one-man conservative investigative unit, pumping out stories destined for Hannity\u2019s show and\u2014inevitably\u2014the eyes of the president.\n\nBefore pivoting to Ukraine conspiracy theories, Solomon wrote a series of stories heavily suggesting the Department of Justice covered up a quid pro quo between Clinton and Russia during the approval of the Uranium One deal\u2014a debunked scandal that nevertheless provided ammo for Trumpworld\u2019s long-running narrative that the \u201creal Russia scandal\u201d centered on Clinton and the Obama administration. He also published an \u201cexclusive\u201d story saying that several women who accused Trump of sexual harassment sought payments from tabloid news outlets for exclusive rights to their stories as well as financial support from partisan donors.\n\nWhile both questionable-at-best stories received the usual conservative media plaudits, Solomon\u2019s reporting rankled colleagues and reportedly caused consternation among Hill middle management.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that more than a dozen staffers wrote a memo specifically criticizing Solomon\u2019s handling of the story about Trump\u2019s alleged harassment victims, which they said omitted the important context that seeking donor support is neither a new practice nor is it unique to one political party. The staffers also expressed dismay about other stories, including the Uranium One deal, and noted that Solomon\u2019s work often negatively colored the way some important sources viewed engaging with The Hill.\n\n\u201cI am disturbed that a reporter at a purportedly non-partisan publication is pumping out pieces that appear to be heavily slanted towards one side of the ideological spectrum, and I am especially disturbed that these stories appear to be repeatedly leaked to a close informal adviser of President Trump (Sean Hannity) ahead of their publication,\u201d one staffer wrote, according to a copy of the 2018 memo obtained this week by The Daily Beast. \u201cIt is difficult to see myself having a future at this company if it continues to prioritize heavily-slanted reporting that appears to be designed to curry favor with one side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the memo, Hill management tried to simultaneously assuage internal concerns and tamp down any perception of internal strife. Editors eventually sent around a social-media policy memo unsubtly warning staffers against publicly criticizing colleagues or talking about internal matters to outside media.\n\nBut the company also tried in earnest to quell tension in the ranks, instituting a parental leave program\u2014which staff had been seeking for months\u2014and, in a victory for the paper\u2019s reporting staff, labeling Solomon\u2019s stories as \u201copinion\u201d pieces. (Hannity, of course, has continued to hype Solomon as an \u201cinvestigative reporter,\u201d despite The Hill\u2019s clarification.)", "description": "Gerald Martineau/The Washington Post/GettyBeltway-centric newspaper The Hill employs a team of dozens of journalists from a variety of backgrounds.
