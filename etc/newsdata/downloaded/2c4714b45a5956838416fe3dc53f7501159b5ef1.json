I am mixed. I am both\u2019 (Picture: Jerry Syder for Metro.co.uk)\n\nHer parents met in Mexico, while her dad was on holiday and her mum was studying. They fell in love and somehow Shakayra\u2019s dad persuaded her mum to get married and move to Europe \u2013 despite never having been there before.\n\n\u2018They married against the odds and my mother started a new life in Vienna, knowing not a single soul and thousands of miles away from her family in Jamaica and the States.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShakayra says that being mixed-race is complex, yet beautiful. She likes the idea of being a bridge between cultures but recognises that being in that position is not without its challenges.\n\n\u2018It took me a lot of soul searching and trying to fit into both my white Austrian and black Jamaican community to find that I simply do not fit in either. I am bang in the middle,\u2019 she explains.\n\n\u2018I cannot choose because there is nothing to choose.\n\n\u2018Austria is a toxic place to grow up in as a person of colour\u2019 (Picture: Shakayra Stern)\n\n\u2018Whenever I tried to fit into the white, Austrian community I was treated like a fraud \u2013 as if I am an imposter with curly hair who just happens to speak fluent German.\n\n\u2018Then, whenever I used to visit my Grandad in Jamaica I was called \u201cthe white girl\u201d and people stared at me as if I was an alien. I explained that I was also Jamaican, again no one believed me.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see the point of trying to fit into a box I simply do not belong in. I am mixed. I am both.\n\n\u2018Now, as an adult, it makes sense to me why I had to face all that rejection; I was forcing myself to be someone I am not.\n\n\u2018That being said, the rejection from the black community was never blatant racism like it was from some people I came across in Austria. But still, that sense of belonging was always missing.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShakayra says that she has always struggled to fit in, ever since her school days. She attended a private Catholic school in Vienna, picked out by her white grandmother.\n\n\u2018My mother had no say back then,\u2019 says Shakayra. \u2018She just thought that it must be the best option as it was expensive. The truth is, the minute I started school I was made to feel like an outsider.\n\n\u2018I would get picked on by my classmates almost daily. To them, I was always just the black girl with funny hair.\n\n\u2018Being mixed-race is not a magic card you can flaunt that exempts you from racism\u2019 (Picture: Shakayra Stern)\n\n\u2018My mother had to take my brother and I out of school to fly us to Jamaica for her dad\u2019s funeral and the principal of the school said to us: \u201cYes, of course, you can go back to Africa\u201d.\n\n\u2018I was only 12, but I was very well aware that Jamaica was nowhere near Africa. Why did this supposedly educated man not know where Jamaica was?\n\n\u2018That was the first time where it dawned on me that a lot of people in Austria could not care less if you were half white. And that was hurtful. Not because I do not want to be black, but because he denied us our identity and did it in so swiftly that we did not even know how to respond.\n\n\u2018What do you say when someone in authority is racist? My mother just smiled and walked away.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was another incident in a P.E class where a teacher refused to believe Shakayra was Austrian, and actually got angry with her when she couldn\u2019t explain where she was from.\n\n\u2018The teacher looked at me and said; \u201cyou cannot possibly be from here, where are you from?\u201d I was 10. I did not understand what she meant so I said; \u201cI am from Vienna.\u201d\n\n\u2018The teacher looked at me in disbelief and started raising her voice \u2013 enraged \u2013 and told me that I cannot possibly be Austrian with a name like Shakayra and that I ought to tell her where I am really from.\n\n\u2018I will never forget the embarrassment I felt in that moment.\u2019\n\n\u2018Older people in home country, including my own grandmother, still have a deeply entrenched hatred towards black people\u2019 (Picture: Shakayra Stern)\n\nShakayra has experienced these kinds of incidents from all sides. She feels that it isn\u2019t only her white side that is questioned, people have denied her black heritage too.\n\n\u2018Recently I was dating an African-American guy and I was shocked at the deep issues about race that are clearly still alive and kicking in some black men.\n\n\u2018He would tell me on the regular that I had better \u201cstep up\u201d and start learning to cook like a \u201creal black girl\u201d, and that the way I act is \u201cway too white.\u201d\n\n\u2018Whenever I tried to explain I am actually mixed, I was met with a long lecture about how being mixed is just a recent social construction, that it is not real.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Your genes mean nothing to ignorant people. They will always pick and choose what they see you as and run with that narrative regardless of the evidence and what you tell them, and that is so tiring sometimes.\u2019\n\nShakayra was bullied regularly at school. Kids told her that her nose was too wide, that her hair was weird and unpleasant to touch. But the worst of it was the reaction to her childhood crushes.\n\n\u2018One boy went so far as to humiliate me in front of the whole class. I wrote him a love letter and he laughed loudly in my face in front of everyone.\n\n\u2018The girls in my class would make fun of me and sometimes even get into physical fights with me. Teachers would typically defend them and ask me what I did to agitate them.\u2019\n\nAnd the racist hostility that Shakayra faced extended beyond the classroom as well.\n\n\u2018Once, when I was waiting for my train in Vienna, I was casually called the N-word by a random stranger. This was not a one-off,\u2019 says Shakayra.\n\n\u2018Many times I would overhear conversations on public transport where other people would say that they are tired of these \u201cn*****s\u201d and would look in my direction. They assumed I did not speak German.\n\n\u2018I once had tomatoes thrown at me on the street, and another time I had a bucket of water poured over me from a house window while I was walking, minding my own business.\u2019\n\nShakayra says she will always love her home country and says she feels a deep affiliation to Austria. She even made some solid friendships with more diverse students after moving schools, but the racism she feels there and has felt in the past, will always make her relationship with her birthplace more complicated.\n\n\u2018It is a toxic place to grow up in as a person of colour,\u2019 she tells us. \u2018It does not matter if you are mixed-race. The older generation in particular, and that is including my own grandmother, still have a deeply entrenched hatred towards black people.\n\n\u2018My white grandmother, up until this day, cannot stand my mother, her only reason is because she is black. She thinks her son brought shame to the family by marrying a black woman.\n\n\u2018My brother and I were treated as the \u201cgolden children\u201d by her. We received love and were shown off by her, but now as an adult, I wonder if that was just because we were lighter than my mother.\u2019\n\nShakayra knows that not all Austrians feel the same as her grandmother. Case-in-point \u2013 her grandfather, her dad\u2019s dad.\n\n\u2018My grandfather took my mother in as if she had always been his daughter and fought every battle for her you can imagine,\u2019 says Shakayra. \u2018From helping her learn German, to putting a good word in when she was looking for work.\n\n\u2018He showed me the warm, genuine and caring side of older Austria.\n\n\u2018I just wish our parents and grandparents knew how much immense pressure mixed children deal with and prepared us for it more.\n\n\u2018It often feels like you\u2019re some type of bargaining tool to keep the peace.\n\n\u2018Being mixed-race is not a magic card you can flaunt that exempts you from racism.\n\n\u2018In many cases, you will face difficulties simply due to your skin tone, regardless of how well-spoken you are, or how \u201cpretty\u201d your curls are.\u2019\n\nBut Where Are You Really From? Extract Shakayra has recently published a memoir about being mixed-race. Here\u2019s an extract about navigating the corporate world: Whenever it came to job applications I was simply \u2018the black one\u2019. Now as a woman I adore that my mother gave me such a unique name but without a doubt every single job interview I would be asked: \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 and questioned as to why and how I\u2019m bilingual. I was always treated as a fraud by default. The funny thing is that whoever interviewed me would never voice their ignorance upfront; that someone who looks like me, speaks German would be strange to them. It was always sentences like: \u2018So where did you learn German?\u2019 \u2018How come you don\u2019t have an accent?\u2019 I remember once working on an ad-hoc German project and a guy from East Germany having an argument with me whether I have an accent when I speak German. I explained to him several times that this was my mother tongue and I couldn\u2019t possibly have an accent because that\u2019s where I was born and raised and spent my first 18 years of life. He never said it but all he saw was a black girl pretending to speak German. It made me angry to defend something that was crystal clear to me yet so alien to him. But Where Are You Really From? Shakayra Stern\n\nShakayra says that the microaggressions she now faces since moving to London are a minefield to navigate.\n\n\u2018I work in corporate environments a lot and people would ask: \u201cSo, where did you learn German?\u201d To which I always reply; \u201cI am Austrian, there is no need to learn your mother tongue.\u201d Then comes the blank stare.\n\n\u2018To a stranger, this may seem like a normal question, but would you ever ask a Caucasian woman with blonde hair why she speaks French with no accent? No.\n\n\u2018What is so mind-boggling is that we would never do the same to others but we are always on the receiving end of the questions. Curiosity is not always the reason.\n\n\u2018Stereotypes about mixed-race and black women are often embedded in the black community too.\u2019\n\nShakayra says this is most apparent when she politely rebuffs \u2018romantic\u2019 advances.\n\n\u2018It happens sometimes with black guys; if I don\u2019t want to give them my number they tell me I must think I am \u201ctoo nice\u201d, or they say I am a typical light-skin girl; stuck up and arrogant. It can be mentally exhausting.\u2019\n\nShakayra loves celebrating her Caribbean heritage and takes part in Carnival every year. She says it helps her piece together who she is.\n\n\u2018Carnival has given me a missing piece to my ever-evolving identity puzzle,\u2019 says Shakayra.\n\n\u2018Being in the middle of two or multiple heritages teaches you to not judge a book by its cover, and it broadens your horizons from birth as you see the world from two or more different cultural lenses.\u2019\n\nShakayra wants it to be easier for people to identify as mixed-race without people making assumptions or snap judgments about their deeper intentions.\n\n\u2018Declaring that we are mixed-race does not mean we are segregating ourselves from anyone, it simply means we are embracing who we really are.\n\n\u2018We do enjoy privileges as we are seen as more \u201cpalatable\u201d, but we still face discrimination and stereotypes like our darker-skinned brothers and sisters.\n\n\u2018It would be great if society started to understand that fetishizing us does more harm than good and that it can create insecurities within us which we may never heal from.\u2019\n\nMixed Up Being mixed-race is so much more than just black and white (Pictures: Jerry Syder) Mixed Up is our weekly series that gets to the heart of what it means to be mixed-race in the UK today. Going beyond discussions of divided identity, this series takes a look at the unique joys, privileges and complexities that come with being mixed-race - across of variety of different contexts. The mixed-race population is the UK's fastest-growing ethnic group, and yet there is still so much more to understand about the varied lived experiences of individuals within this hugely heterogenous group. Each week we speak to the people who know exactly how it feels to navigate this inbetween space.\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Yes, you can still be racist even if you have mixed-race kids\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018I have a really unusual mix \u2013 I love that no one can ever guess where I\u2019m from\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Being mixed-race is like being a fly on the wall \u2013 it\u2019s crazy what people feel comfortable saying\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Shakayra's mum is Jamaican and her dad is Austrian, but that's not quite the full story.
