All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2019\n\nWhile guest co-hosting for \"The View,\" Gingrich spoke about the tweet.\n\n\"It's exactly the same term that Clarence Thomas used when he said he was guilty of a white collar lynching,\" Gingrich said, referring to questioning that the Supreme Court justice faced during his 1991 nomination process over allegations of unwanted advances and lews comments by Anita Hill, who once worked for him.\n\n\"[Trump was] beaten out for over two years with the Mueller thing,\" Gingrich continued. \"You start to relax. All of a sudden there's this whole new wave of things, and I think part of what you have is a guy here who's just really deeply frustrated that no matter where he turns, you know, the fight keeps going on.\"\n\nAfter calling Trump a \"very important historic figure,\" Gingrich noted that \"there are things that he does that make it all harder\" for him to be in office.\n\n\"If he were more disciplined, he would actually have a much easier road than he does,\" Gingrich said. \"He sort of chews up his own road as he goes down it.\"\n\nSunny Hostin grilled Gingrich about the racial connotation that comes with the term \"lynching\" and asked if he thought it was racially charged to use the word. Gingrich began his response by saying it was going to be \"very politically incorrect.\"\n\n\"Most of the early American movies on lynching were about lynching white people,\" Gingrich said. \"One of the largest lynchings of the 19th century was Italians. So, there is a tradition here. It's not only about black experience.\"\n\nWhen Whoopi Goldberg followed up on the question, asking if it was necessary for the term to be used at all, Gingrich said \"it wasn't.\" Trump, he said, \"often uses words more clumsily than he should.\"\n\n\"I've been comfortable just calling it a witch hunt and a kangaroo court and things like that,\" Gingrich said of the impeachment inquiry into Trump. \"I haven't gone up to that next level.\"\n\nGingrich, a Republican from Georgia, served as speaker of the House from 1995 to 1999, during which he successfully helped lead Republican efforts to impeach then-President Bill Clinton.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an official impeachment inquiry into President Trump in September. As someone who's been down the road to impeachment, Gingrich was asked by Abby Huntsman to share his thoughts about how the process is being handled.\n\n\"I think had Speaker Pelosi referred the Ukrainian phone call to a special counsel, they could do a lot of things,\" he said. \"Today, the White House doesn't have a lawyer in these hearings. Secretary [Mike] Pompeo has staff going into a hearing, has no lawyer there, has no idea what they're saying.\"\n\nGingrich concluded that he wouldn't take the same steps Pelosi has made in the impeachment inquiry so far because Pelosi \"has no referral that says [Trump's] guilty of anything.\" He said she isn't \"following rules that are fair\" as to \"allow the person being accused to face their accuser.\" Whistleblowers are protected by law against retaliation for lawfully filing a complaint for wrongdoing.\n\nPelosi and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff defended their impeachment probe on Oct. 15.\n\n\"I'm not concerned about anything,\" Pelosi said. Republicans \"can't defend the president so they're going to process.\"\n\n\"We're not here to call bluffs. We're here to find the truth,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi says when asked about the decision not to hold an impeachment inquiry vote for now.\n\n\n\n\"This is not a game for us.
