Our position has remained consistent and clear on this,\u201d Geng said without elaborating.\n\nTrump\u2019s appeal to China was particularly striking as the two countries are set to hold another round of talks in the United States this week to resolve a bitter trade war.\n\nQuestioned about whether he had asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to look into the Bidens, Trump told reporters on Thursday: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks on China have also stiffened the resolve of Democrats in the House of Representatives to push ahead with an inquiry into whether he should be impeached following revelations by an anonymous whistleblower who said Trump asked Ukraine in July to investigate the Bidens.\n\nTrump froze $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, prompting accusations from Democrats that he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain.\n\nTrump has described the impeachment probe as \u201ccrap\u201d.\n\nSome Republicans have criticized Biden for taking his son on the Air Force Two vice presidential plane in 2013 to China, a trip that came months after Hunter became an unpaid board member of a new investment fund with a Chinese private equity manager.\n\nHunter Biden has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe younger Biden was also on the board of a Ukrainian gas company at a time when the United States and Europe were trying to woo Ukraine away from next-door-neighbor Russia.", "description": "The Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday that China had no intention of intervening in U.S. domestic affairs when asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that Beijing investigate his Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
