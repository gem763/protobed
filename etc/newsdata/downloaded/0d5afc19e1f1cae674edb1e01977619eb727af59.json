That number involves future profits and the value of drugs currently in development.\n\nIn addition, the family would have to give up its ownership of the company and contribute another $1.5 billion by selling another of its pharmaceutical companies, Mundipharma.\n\nSeveral attorneys general said the agreement was a better way to ensure compensation from Purdue and the Sacklers than taking their chances if Purdue files for bankruptcy on its own.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said the deal \u201cwas the quickest and surest way to get immediate relief for Arizona and for the communities that have been harmed by the opioid crisis and the actions of the Sackler family.\u201d\n\nBut even advocates of the deal cautioned that it\u2019s not yet complete.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a settlement,\u201d said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost whose state was among those supporting it. \u201cThere is a proposal that\u2019s been accepted by a majority of attorneys general, but there are quite a few significant states that have not joined at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of telephone calls going on. I think we see the outlines of a thing that might be, but it\u2019s not yet,\u201d Yost said in an interview.\n\nOpioid addiction has contributed to the deaths of some 400,000 Americans over the past two decades, hitting many rural communities particularly hard.\n\nThe lawsuits against Stamford, Connecticut-based Purdue paint it as a particular villain in the crisis. They say the company\u2019s aggressive marketing of OxyContin downplayed addiction risks and led to more widespread opioid prescribing, even though only a sliver of the opioid painkillers sold in the U.S. were its products.\n\nThe tentative agreement and expected bankruptcy filing would remove Purdue from the first federal trial over the opioids epidemic, scheduled to begin next month in Ohio.\n\nIn a statement after Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the company said that it \u201ccontinues to work with all plaintiffs on reaching a comprehensive resolution to its opioid litigation that will deliver billions of dollars and vital opioid overdose rescue medicines to communities across the country impacted by the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nEven with Wednesday\u2019s development, many states have not signed on. Several state attorneys general vowed to continue their legal battles against the Sacklers and the company in bankruptcy court. Roughly 20 states have sued members of the Sackler family in state courts.\n\nConnecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin were among the states saying they were not part of the agreement.\n\n\u201cOur position remains firm and unchanged and nothing for us has changed today,\u201d Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe scope and scale of the pain, death and destruction that Purdue and the Sacklers have caused far exceeds anything that has been offered thus far,\u201d Tong said. \u201cConnecticut\u2019s focus is on the victims and their families, and holding Purdue and the Sacklers accountable for the crisis they have caused.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro called the tentative deal \u201ca slap in the face to everyone who has had to bury a loved one due to this family\u2019s destruction and greed.\u201d\n\nHe said he intends to continue fighting the Sacklers, who he said did not have to acknowledge any wrongdoing in their agreement.\n\n\u201cThis is far from over,\u201d he said.\n\nRyan Hampton, a Los Angeles-based advocate for people in recovery from opioid addiction, said he was launching \u201ca massive effort\u201d among victims\u2019 families and others impacted by the crisis to urge state attorneys general not to accept the deal.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money that\u2019s being offered in this settlement doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface for what\u2019s needed,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cWe want to see Purdue have their day in court. We know more money will come if this case goes to trial.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s announcement came just days after a group of attorneys general negotiating directly with Purdue and the Sacklers said they had reached an impasse in talks. At the time, several attorneys general said they were not confident Purdue would pay the amount promised and wanted more assurance that the money would come through.\n\nIn the latest settlement agreement, New York Attorney General Letitia James accused the Sacklers of \u201cattempting to evade responsibility and lowball the millions of victims of the opioid crisis.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Sackler family said in a statement that it \u201csupports working toward a global resolution that directs resources to the patients, families and communities across the country who are suffering and need assistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most effective way to address the urgency of the current public health crisis, and to fund real solutions, not endless litigation,\u201d it said.\n\nSome 2,000 lawsuits brought by local governments, Native American tribes, unions and hospitals have been consolidated under a federal judge in Cleveland, who has been encouraging the parties to settle. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Polster invited state attorneys general, who had filed their own lawsuits, to lead the negotiations.\n\nHow any money from the settlement would be divided among all the entities is not entirely clear. Nevertheless, attorneys representing the local governments issued a statement saying they recommended the governments agree to the deal as a way to bring relief to their communities.\n\nIn March, Purdue and members of the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with Oklahoma to avoid a trial on the toll of opioids there.\n\nA court filing made public in Massachusetts this year asserts that members of the Sackler family were paid more than $4 billion by Purdue from 2007 to 2018. Much of the family\u2019s fortune is believed to be held outside the U.S., which could complicate lawsuits against the family over opioids.\n\nThe Sacklers have given money to cultural institutions around the world, including the Smithsonian Institution, New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art and London\u2019s Tate Modern.", "description": "OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma reached a tentative deal Wednesday with about half the states and thousands of local governments over its role in the nation\u2019s...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HF002_oxy030_ZG_20190304175329.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
