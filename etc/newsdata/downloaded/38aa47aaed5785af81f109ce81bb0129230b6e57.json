People can disagree on issues, but it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 21, 2019\n\nGabbard has come under fire throughout the presidential race over her foreign policy views in particular, with critics touting her non-interventionist positions \u2013 namely in Syria \u2013 as proof of her allegiance to foreign powers.\n\nWhile a number of Bernie supporters thanked the Senator for having Tulsi\u2019s back, some commenters online were disappointed by how long he took to muster a defense, with fellow Democratic candidates Beto O\u2019Rourke, Andrew Yang and Pete Buttigieg beating him to the punch over the weekend.\n\nIt took you longer to defend @TulsiGabbard from Hillary Clinton's disgusting smear than it did for you to recover from your heart attack\n\n\n\nWonder why that is, @BernieSanders? \u2014 Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain) October 21, 2019\n\nOther commenters predicted it was only a matter of time before Bernie earned his own \u2018foreign agent\u2019 accusation, for defending the wrong people.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to use her support for you and your connection to her as a way to smear you as a Russian asset, senator,\u201d one supporter wrote. \u201cPlease be prepared.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Hillary Clinton\u2019s attacks on Tulsi Gabbard sow more Democratic division than Moscow could ever dream of\n\nNaturally, those still enamored with the Russiagate conspiracy theory also took to social media to reiterate Clinton\u2019s claim, and even supplement her theory, with one commenter positing a mysterious comparison between Gabbard and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.\n\nExtremely measured responses from the Hillary dead-ender crowd. pic.twitter.com/YpfGWrktyh \u2014 DSA Swarthykin Caucus \u277c (@QueenInYeIIow) October 21, 2019\n\nTulsi\u2019s own response to Clinton\u2019s allegation was perhaps the most devastating, shredding the former secretary of state and failed 2016 presidential candidate as the \u201cqueen of warmongers\u201d and the \u201cembodiment of corruption,\u201d and even invited her to join the race.\n\nGabbard served in Iraq as a combat medic with the Hawaii Army National Guard, completing her first tour of duty in 2005. She was deployed again to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009 as an Army military police officer.
