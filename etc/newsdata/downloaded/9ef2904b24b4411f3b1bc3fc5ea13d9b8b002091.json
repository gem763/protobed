While speaking with the pair, Trump mistakenly suggested this was the first female spacewalk ever \u2014 a point that the astronauts corrected him on.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time for a woman outside of the space station,\u201d Trump said. He later added: \u201cYou are amazing people; they\u2019re conducting the first ever female spacewalk to replace an exterior part of the space station. They\u2019re doing some work, and they\u2019re doing it in a very high altitude \u2014 an altitude that very few people will ever see.\u201d\n\nIn her response, Meir made it clear that they were building on the work of many previous women who had spacewalked before them. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take too much credit because there have been many other female spacewalkers before,\u201d Meir said. \u201cThis is the first time that there\u2019s been two women outside at the same time.\u201d In the history of spaceflight, only 15 women have ever spacewalked, including Meir and Koch.\n\nAstronauts in space have lightly corrected the president during a phone call before. In 2017, Trump asked NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson when she thought astronauts would head to Mars, just after signing a new authorization bill for NASA that outlined the timeline for that. \u201cWell I think as your bill directed, it\u2019ll be approximately in the 2030s,\u201d Whitson replied at the time.\n\nKoch and Meir\u2019s call with Trump only lasted about five minutes. They still have a few hours left in space after replacing a failed unit needed for charging and discharging batteries.", "description": "Today, President Trump took a few moments out of his day to speak with NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir, who are currently conducting the first all-female spacewalk in history on the outside of the International Space Station.
