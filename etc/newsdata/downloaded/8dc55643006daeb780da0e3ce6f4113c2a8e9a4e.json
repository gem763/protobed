I like to spend a lot of time on makeup because in my opinion I'm not very good at it, so that's what takes the most time other than affixing bows and clips to my head in a sort of Tetris-like arrangement.\n\nShe shares her incredible sense of style with her 68,000 followers on Instagram under the handle, @katiebabydoll and has spoken about how much she has spent on achieving her dream of becoming a living doll over the years.\n\nHer ultimate dream would be to one day be recognised for her style on the front cover of Vogue magazine.", "description": "Katie Castles, from Los Angeles, loves Japanese anime cartoons and bases her 'androgynous' look on them", "authors": ["Rebecca Drew", "Kelly-Ann Mills", "Image", "Mdwfeatures", "Katiebabydoll"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20672233.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Im-a-Real-Life-Doll.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
