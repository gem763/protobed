Esper told reporters that he would not rule out the possibility that the American troops could conduct cross-border missions into Syria from their new home in Iraq.\n\nExplaining his decision to pull US troops out of Syria, Trump argued earlier this month that it was \u201ctime to bring our soldiers back home\u201d \u2013 but it now appears that this won\u2019t be happening any time soon. The US troop withdrawal coincided with Turkey\u2019s military incursion into the region, purportedly to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syrian territory. The military operation has been widely condemned by the international community.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018We don\u2019t own Syria\u2019: Lee Camp shreds media\u2019s \u2018manipulative\u2019 coverage of US troop withdrawal (VIDEO)\n\nThe pullout caused a full-blown media meltdown, with the New York Times even wringing its hands over the fact that Syrian forces were filling the \u201cUS void\u201d in northern Syria.
