I mean, why do any of us read problem pages? We don\u2019t really want the problem \u201csolved\u201d; we like wallowing in the wretchedness of others. Particularly sexually. No one cares about people having a good time. What we really want are premature ejaculators with herpes.\n\nIt is in this spirit that I am delighted to come across a problem that I have never suffered from and am unlikely to encounter: \u201cdiet face\u201d.\n\nLast week, the broadcaster Jenni Murray said she was content not to lose any more weight, having lost 25kg (4st) after a sleeve gastrectomy, because she didn\u2019t want her face to collapse like Nigel Lawson\u2019s. So diet face \u2013 people getting skinny in middle age and then looking gaunt and aged \u2013 is a thing! Obviously, it is more of a thing for women, because everything is. Cosmetic surgeons, those doctors of insecurity, talk of gravitational descent, eyebrow deflation, jowling and neck laxity. Nice.\n\nThe actor Courteney Cox once said: \u201cIn Hollywood, to get your bottom half to be the right size, your face may have to be a little gaunt.\u201d Or, as the adage has it, at some stage you have to choose between your face and your arse. But don\u2019t worry, because none of us need to look like skulls on sticks thanks to fillers, which can replace your lost subcutaneous fat. You can inject all sorts of stuff into your face, as well as doing something called a \u201cmicro-fat transfer\u201d .\n\nThis really is modern womanhood: starve yourself stupid and work out every goddamned minute so that you can stay young-looking \u2013 but don\u2019t forget to spend a fortune plumping up your caved-in face.\n\nOr here\u2019s an idea: chips.\n\nSuzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist", "description": "Jenni Murray says she doesn\u2019t want to shed more pounds for fear of looking gaunt.
