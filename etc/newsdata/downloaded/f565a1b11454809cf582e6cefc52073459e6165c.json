It was obvious because he had a short shirt on and was carrying a child that he wasn\u2019t Islamic State. I believe they will both be taken to a refugee camp.\"", "description": "A screaming father running down a rubble-strewn street in Mosul carrying his distressed daughter was one of the most powerful Reuters images taken during the Iraqi-led assault to remove Islamic State from its stronghold.", "authors": ["Goran Tomasevic", "Reuters Photographers"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ7hB6lwFUoWCi0hGNDD3jxvRvsNerjGesGF4bQtblqU7Ch5on0agmHNMY9d-qEIIVsGL2zXXABEJIMRQcfCkz5-uphThYMSN4OYLM3L5ttam"}
