Some believe the tipping point is still 15 to 20 years away, while others say the warning accurately reflects the danger that Bolsonaro and global heating pose to the Amazon\u2019s survival.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stock, so like any stock you run it down, run it down \u2013 then suddenly you don\u2019t have any more of it,\u201d said De Bolle, whose brief also recommended solutions to the current crisis.\n\nBolsonaro has vowed to develop the Amazon, and his government plans to allow mining on protected indigenous reserves. Amazon farmers support his attacks on environmental protection agencies. His business-friendly environment minister, Ricardo Salles, has met loggers and wildcat miners, while deforestation and Amazon fires have soared since he assumed office in January.\n\nThe policy brief noted that Brazil\u2019s space research institute, INPE, reported that deforestation in August was 222% higher than in August 2018. Maintaining the current rate of increase INPE reported between January and August this year would bring the Amazon \u201cdangerously close to the estimated tipping point as soon as 2021 \u2026 beyond which the rainforest can no longer generate enough rain to sustain itself\u201d, De Bolle wrote.\n\nDe Bolle is also head of the Latin American studies programme at Johns Hopkins University and last month addressed a US Congress committee on preserving the Amazon. She called her prediction a \u201cprovocation\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf Bolsonaro is serious about developing the Amazon without paying any attention to sustainability or maintaining the forest\u2019s standing, these rates would happen within his mandate,\u201d she said.\n\nCarlos Nobre, one of Brazil\u2019s leading climate scientists and a senior researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Institute for Advanced Studies, questioned her calculation that estimated deforestation would quadruple from an estimate of nearly 18,000 km2 this year to nearly 70,000 km2 by 2021.\n\n\u201cIt seems very improbable to me \u2013 the projected deforestation increase is more an economic calculation than ecological,\u201d he said. However, he added: \u201cWe are seeing an increase in deforestation, I am not questioning this.\u201d\n\nLast year, Nobre argued in an article written with celebrated American conservation biologist Thomas Lovejoy that the Amazon tipping point could happen in eastern, southern and central Amazonia when 20% to 25% of the rainforest has been felled \u2013 not expected for 20 to 25 years. He has since brought forward his prediction by about five years.\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is already 17% deforested, so when you calculate at the current rate of deforestation, this 20% to 25% is reached in 15 to 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope she is wrong. If she is right, it is the end of the world.\u201d\n\nBut Lovejoy, a professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, said that De Bolle\u2019s projection could come true because global heating, soaring deforestation and an increase in Amazon fires have created a \u201cnegative synergy\u201d that is accelerating its destruction \u2013 citing droughts in recent years as a warning sign.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing the first flickering of that tipping,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like a seal trying to balance a rubber ball on its nose \u2026 the only sensible thing to do is to do some reforestation and build back that margin of safety.\u201d\n\nAmong other commitments under the Paris climate deal, signed by leftist former president Dilma Rousseff, Brazil agreed to reforest 12m hectares and end illegal deforestation by 2030.\n\nMongabay reported last month that Brazil looks increasingly unlikely to meet its Paris targets. Deforestation began rising under Rousseff in 2013 after nine years of decline and has accelerated under Bolsonaro.\n\nClaudio Angelo of the Climate Observatory \u2013 an umbrella of non-profit environmental groups \u2013 said he thought De Bolle\u2019s calculations were too pessimistic, but praised her brief\u2019s other recommendations.\n\nThese included expanding the Amazon fund, which finances sustainable rainforest projects to include the United States and other countries so that Brazil is not expected to fund rainforest protection virtually on its own. The Amazon Fund is currently financed by Norway and Germany, but both countries suspended payments in August.\n\nDe Bolle said Brazil should revive a resolution that made rural credit financed by public banks dependent on lenders proving that they complied with environmental and other laws. \u201cThat\u2019s a big stick,\u201d she said.\n\nAngelo said \u201cthe points [De Bolle] made are quite real\u201d. \u201cFor all the madness, Bolsonaro did manage to make people talk about the Amazon,\u201d he said.", "description": "Forecast suggests rainforest could stop producing enough rain to sustain itself by 2021", "authors": ["Dom Phillips", "Van Badham", "Rowan Williams", "Raoni Metuktire"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/464ae2bb4bd7460d42417cd7c160debf346b2b31/0_322_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53a8eb9fb9e7a32d10ef64dbdc2514af", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
