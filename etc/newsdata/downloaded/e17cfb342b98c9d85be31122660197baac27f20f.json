I was like, \u2018I can\u2019t give her 28 years\u2019,\u201d Juror 34 recalled telling the 12-person panel. Ten years, the juror said, acknowledged the severity of the crime but also allowed the 31-year-old to rebuild a life post-release.\n\nGuyger, who is white, wept on the stand and testified that on the evening of Sept. 6, 2018, she thought she was entering her own unit, one floor below, when she encountered her unarmed black neighbor in his apartment. The off-duty officer mistook him for an intruder and fired two shots, killing Jean.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Guyger said last week. \u201cI never wanted to take an innocent person\u2019s life.\"\n\n\u201cI wish he was the one with the gun that killed me,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter a week-long trial riddled with drama, the jury rejected Guyger\u2019s self-defense claim and delivered a murder conviction \u2014 a verdict many have called historic.\n\nFaced with the power to take away a person\u2019s liberty for 28 years, Juror 21 told ABC News that a handful of jurors cried. Juror 24, attempting to channel what Jean would want, asked for a less harsh sentence.\n\nA white cop shot an innocent black man in his own home. The \u2018castle doctrine\u2019 nearly protected her.\n\n\u201cThey were asking us to take an eye for an eye for Botham,\u201d Juror 21 said, \u201cand I feel like he isn\u2019t someone who would take an eye for an eye. He would turn the other cheek.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe juror continued, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like I had any right to speak for him, and he isn\u2019t there to talk for himself, but listening to how people talked about him, I felt like he would forgive her.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOutside the courtroom and through Wednesday night, protesters criticized the number as too lenient.\n\nThose closest to Jean supported it.\n\nJean\u2019s 18-year-old brother Brandt Jean gave a stunning victim impact statement, rejecting an overly harsh punishment and, instead, evoked forgiveness. Addressing Guyger directly, he said he didn\u2019t want to see her incarcerated, then asked the judge for permission to hug her. Brandt Jean and Guyger clutched each other, weeping in a drawn-out embrace.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018Not racist but \u2026\u2019: White police officer who killed innocent black man in his home sent offensive texts\n\nThat night, Jean\u2019s parents addressed the crowd that had gathered at a memorial service held at their church. His father addressed the congregation and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t hate you, [Amber]. You have broken us, but we would like to become friends at some point in time, I think I have the ability to do it ... despite my loss,\u201d according the local NBC affiliate.\n\nAD\n\nOn Friday, Juror 21 said, \u201cI don\u2019t think Botham would want to take harsh vengeance.\"\n\nRead more\n\nAmber Guyger conviction: What we know \u2014 and don\u2019t know \u2014 about how diverse juries behave\n\nSupreme Court term to begin with blockbuster question: Is it legal to fire someone for being gay or transgender?\n\nVaping lung injuries surpass 1,000 cases as deaths rise to 18\n\nToxic lead, scared parents, simmering anger: A month inside a city without clean water\n\nThe Harvard affirmative action decision is not a loss for Asian Americans\n\nAD", "description": "\"They were asking us to take an eye for an eye for Botham,\" one juror said, \"and I feel like he isn't someone who would take an eye for an eye.\"", "authors": ["Deanna Paul", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tROpXgzn3Q9fE3foJC9gK-CbU_g=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-03-2019/t_d04c00cc595449aba57205ce066f2236_name_1___1920x1080___30p_00_02_06_22_Still019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
