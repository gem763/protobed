The thing that always makes the manager different in these circumstances is that they rarely get much of a choice in the matter.\n\nWithout a point from his team's last four Premier League games, danger stalks Marco Silva\n\nWithout a point from his team's last four Premier League games, danger stalks Silva right now. Everton are third from bottom, prompting talk of change. Even a return for David Moyes has been mentioned.\n\nBut it would be wrong to sack Silva now, as well as unfair. To change manager again for the fourth time in a little over three years would make a mockery of what people like Brands and Barrett-Baxendale have been preaching and would arguably be pointing the gun at the wrong person.\n\nSome of Silva's work has been questionable. It would help the Portuguese greatly, for example, if somebody would show his defenders how to clear the ball from a set-piece. Everton's record at defending free-kicks and corners is the worst in the league.\n\nMarcel Brands - recruited from PSV 18 months ago - would argue he needs time for his vision\n\nBut it is Brands who - with some input from his manager - identifies and signs players at Everton and the fact is Silva continues to preside over a squad that looks unbalanced and light in key areas.\n\nEverton, for example, sold Romelu Lukaku to Manchester United three summers ago and have still not adequately replaced him. Players such as Theo Walcott and Alex Iwobi have been brought in from Arsenal to help Everton's attack but if the club are to compete for a place in the top six, why sign cast-offs from clubs they claim to view as rivals?\n\nWalcott has not made an impact during his 22 months at the club while Iwobi has started three league games and scored once since arriving this summer.\n\nEverton have spent heavily during Farhad Moshiri's three and a half years as major shareholder and are the fourth biggest spenders in the Premier League over the last five years.\n\nDuring that time, however, joined-up thinking has not always been a speciality and Ronald Koeman was sacked two years ago while muttering privately that it would have helped had he known whether it was Moshiri and his favourite agents or chairman Bill Kenwright and his who were supposed to be signing the players.\n\nEverton have spent heavily during Farhad Moshiri's three and a half years as major shareholder\n\nThe appointment of Brands was intended to clear that confusion and it has but with that clarity comes the responsibility for him to get things right.\n\nBrands - recruited from PSV 18 months ago - would argue he needs time to implement a vision and he hasn't been helped by the best player signed on his watch - Portuguese midfielder Andre Gomes - being injured for much of the season so far.\n\nBut if Brands deserves some time then so does his manager. For Everton it feels appropriate to put a foot on the ball, and their forthcoming fixtures support that view.\n\nOn the horizon are games against West Ham, Brighton, Watford, Spurs, Southampton and Norwich. It feels as if we will know a little more about Silva - and Brands - after that.\n\nTIME FOR HOWE TO SHOW HIS AMBITION\n\nAt Bournemouth it looks like being another palatable season. They are 10th in the Premier League and we can see the usual pattern of what they do under Eddie Howe. Wins against Aston Villa and Everton set against defeats to Arsenal and Manchester City and a pretty typical early exit from a cup competition.\n\nThis is how Bournemouth do it in the top flight. Beat your rivals, focus on survival. It is enough for Bournemouth and that's quite right but we say Howe is the country's brightest young coach and he says he is ambitious. When will we find out definitively if either is actually true?\n\nWe say Eddie Howe is the country's brightest young coach and he says he is ambitious\n\nCARRICK CONTINUES TO GIVE BACK\n\nIn the North East those who played for the fabled Wallsend Boys Club and went on to better things are celebrated. Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley and Steve Bruce are among them. But speak to people at the club - still going after 115 years - about who has consistently made the most effort to give something back over the years and they will tell you it is Michael Carrick.\n\nAs a young player at West Ham, Carrick regularly used to drive north after games to hand out prizes to boys at Wallsend presentation nights.\n\nSo we should not be surprised that the Manchester United assistant manager set aside the disappointment of defeat at Newcastle a week ago to open a new pitch along with Shearer the next day.\n\nSome footballers make a big fuss about the noble things they do in their spare time. Others proceed much more quietly. We know which we prefer.\n\nMichael Carrick regularly used to drive north to hand out prizes to boys at Wallsend\n\nGOOD WEEK\n\nGraham Potter\n\nThe Brighton manager has been brave enough to try young forwards in a bid to make his team more potent. Ireland's Aaron Connolly and England's Steven Alzate have repaid him so far.\n\nBAD WEEK\n\nJonjo Shelvey\n\nWhile the Longstaff brothers make headlines at Newcastle, Shelvey sits on the bench. He is 27 now and a career is in danger of going unfulfilled.", "description": "IAN LADYMAN: When  Marcel Brands visited Fabian Delph's home to show him a video of what the future held for the club, we can imagine that sacking manager Marco Silva did not feature in it.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/20/19663444-0-image-a-16_1570995441688.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
