Interiors made from innovative recycled materials underscore the sustainable concept of the electric sports car,\u201d Porsche said.\n\nThe Taycan has a range of 450 kilometers, making it the first electric vehicle from a German carmaker capable of rivaling Tesla (TSLA.O) in terms of operating range.\n\nThanks to an 800 volt system, the car is also capable of adding 100 kilometers to its range from a five minute recharging of its battery, Porsche said.\n\nThe Porsche Taycan Turbo S is priced at 185,456 euros, or 138,826 pounds. First customer deliveries are anticipated from January 2020, the carmaker said.\n\nOther sports car makers are also rushing to develop electric models. Ferrari (RACE.N) said last month it hoped to introduce a fully-electric model some time after 2022.", "description": "Porsche is making a leather-free version of its new Taycan electric sports car in the latest attempt by a German automaker to play up green credentials as environmental activists lobby for a boycott of the industry.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426201682&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF831IN"}
