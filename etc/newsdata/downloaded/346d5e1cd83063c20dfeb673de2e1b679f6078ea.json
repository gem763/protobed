He told Reuters that meetings on the matter began in August, but declined to comment further.\n\nTexas' contracts with Alford and Burrus - obtained by Reuters on Wednesday through a public records request - ran from May 29 through Aug. 31, with a maximum hourly fee of $500 and an optional extension. Alford said his contract had been extended through Aug. 31, 2021.\n\nCaffarra's contract runs from Sept. 3 to Aug. 31, 2021 with maximum fees of $0.\n\nBurrus, Caffarra and the Texas attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment. Google, which has said it is cooperating with investigators, declined to comment.\n\nBurrus spent 15 years at Microsoft before joining law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro in 2017 for a short stint. It has represented clients in antitrust and other lawsuits against Google, and his firm biography says he developed an antitrust case that led the EU to fine Google $2.7 billion for its shopping tool in 2017.\n\nA spokesman for Microsoft, which has complained about Google's competitive tactics, did not provide immediate comment.\n\nCaffarra, standing among several attorneys general this month at a news conference for the Google investigation, posted on Twitter that the announcement was \"a huge deal.\"\n\nAlford said he was also at the event.\n\nThough Caffarra's contract with Texas calls for her to earn no money, a slide presentation from August posted on the Charles River website lists Google critic News Corp and competitors Microsoft and Amazon.com Inc among her clients on antitrust matters.\n\nAs part of its investigation, the Texas AG's office has sought information from Oracle, its executive vice president, Ken Glueck, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\nOracle has feuded with Google over several business issues, and was involved in advocacy group FairSearch that pushed for the European Union to investigate Google.\n\nOracle has also heard from the House Judiciary Committee, Glueck said, and has met the Justice Department.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission and several states led by New York's attorney general have confirmed antitrust investigations into Facebook.\n\nThe FTC is also looking at Amazon.com, sources have said. The Justice Department has launched a broad review of large internet companies.\n\n(Reporting by Paresh Dave in San Francisco and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Texas attorney general's office has hired three consultants for a multi-state probe it is leading into Alphabet Inc's Google, including an economist who worked with some of the firm's major rivals and a lawyer who is a Microsoft veteran.", "authors": ["Paresh Dave", "Diane Bartz"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cc2052e22af59c80d03a9-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
