(AP/Alex Brandon)\n\nWith John Wall still sidelined due to injury, one shoe giant is apparently ready to pull the plug.\n\nThe Washington Wizards star and Adidas are reportedly engaged in buyout negotiations to end his five-year shoe and apparel endorsement deal after less than two years, according to ESPN.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWall first signed the deal, which was reportedly worth nearly $25 million, in January 2018. He hasn\u2019t played much since inking the deal, however, dealing with a multitude of injuries \u2014 including a left Achilles injury he suffered in February after slipping in his home.\n\nWall \u2014 who agreed to a massive four-year, $170 million extension in 2017 \u2014 has only played in 74 games over the past two seasons, and is unlikely to see the floor at all this year while recovering from the Achilles injury.\n\nThe 29-year-old started his NBA career with Reebok, though signed a two-year deal with Adidas and launched a pair of signature shoes between 2013 and 2015. He failed to reach a deal with Adidas in 2015, however, and played without a deal until he reached the five-year deal with the company in 2018.\n\nWhile it\u2019s not clear exactly when Wall will finally be healthy and see the court again, it sounds like he will be repping a new brand when he finally does make his long-awaited return in Washington.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Less than two years into a five-year deal, John Wall and Adidas are reportedly working to end their endorsement deal early.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RhgAMcnMsldFa5MO0GO9Xg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/2EtHQ6r775oH0OklI7K1NQ--~B/aD0yNzQ2O3c9NDExOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/0b4ec4b0-5b9f-11e9-b95b-ecd7e1f33db7", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
