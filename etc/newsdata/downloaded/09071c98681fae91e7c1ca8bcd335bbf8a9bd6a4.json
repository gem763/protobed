(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nThe alleged college-admissions bribery ring exposed earlier this week has something to enrage everyone.\n\nThe college-admissions scandal should be the populist issue of our time.\n\nMost of the talk in our politics about how \u201cthe system is rigged\u201d is incredibly abstract and symbolic. But this is infuriatingly concrete.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department revealed a massive effort by wealthy parents and a shady \u201cadmissions consultant\u201d to bribe and cheat their way into getting kids into a slew of elite schools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProsecutors say William Singer, the ringleader of the operation, sold two forms of services. For tens of thousands of dollars, parents could pay for their kids to have a proctor correct their incorrect answers as they took the SAT. Or, if that wouldn\u2019t do the trick, parents could pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe coaches at elite schools to designate applicants as desired athletes, thus circumventing the minimum requirements for grades and test scores.\n\nIn one case, a California family allegedly paid $1.2 million to Singer, who in turn allegedly paid Rudy Meredith, the women\u2019s soccer coach at Yale, $400,000 to claim that the family\u2019s daughter was a coveted recruit even though she didn\u2019t play at all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis scandal is a staggering indictment of higher education, and American education policy generally. Virtually every constituency in American life has good reason to be rankled. Defenders of affirmative action for various minority groups are rightly livid about this effort, by mostly rich white people who already have every advantage imaginable, to game the system. Opponents of affirmative action who argue that merit alone should determine admissions have every reason to be outraged as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor both groups, and for everyone between the two extremes, the pressure to get kids into the best college possible \u2014 and then figure out how to pay for it \u2014 is a source of incredible anxiety.\n\nBut the scandal goes beyond just these issues. It is also a searing indictment of the value of an elite college education in the first place (and the ridiculous emphasis schools place on collegiate sports). None of these parents seemed remotely concerned about whether their kids could hack it once they got into their dream schools \u2014 and rightly so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeorge Mason economics professor Bryan Caplan, in his book The Case Against Education, makes a compelling case that most of the value in diplomas from elite colleges isn\u2019t in the education they allegedly represent but in the cultural or social \u201csignaling\u201d they convey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nImagine you\u2019re deposited on a desert island, forced to fend for yourself. Would you rather have the knowledge that comes with taking a survival-training course, or just the piece of paper that says you took the course? Obviously, you\u2019d rather know how to identify poisonous plants and sources of water than have a diploma that says you know how to do things you can\u2019t do. Now, ask yourself: Would you rather have the Yale education without the diploma, or the diploma without the education?\n\nFrom an economic perspective, the piece of paper is vastly more valuable than the education, particularly in the humanities (and Caplan runs through the numbers to demonstrate this). The paper opens doors and gets you callbacks from employers and entr\u00e9e into elite social circles where whom you know matters more than what you know. The education might make you a better person, but the parchment is the ticket to opportunity. It\u2019s no guarantee of success, but it\u2019s a profound hedge against failure.\n\nParents know this, and parents without special advantages \u2014 wealth, fame, connections \u2014 resent it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a matter of public policy, the way we tell everyone they should go to college, even if it means incurring crushing debt, is a scandal. College isn\u2019t for everyone, and it isn\u2019t necessary for many careers or vocations \u2014 and shouldn\u2019t be necessary for many others.\n\nIf there\u2019s a maxim that should serve as a golden rule for policymakers, it\u2019s this: Complexity is a subsidy. The more complex we make a system, the more it rewards people with the resources \u2014 social, cognitive, political, or financial \u2014 to navigate it. A system that rewards subjective priorities \u2014 in the name of diversity, athletics, social justice, donations, preferences for legacy students, whatever \u2014 creates opportunities for bureaucrats, parents, and students to game the system.\n\nYou\u2019re never going to create a system where some parents won\u2019t do anything and everything to help their kids. All you can do is create a system that makes it more difficult to cheat or exploit loopholes. That requires clear, simple rules applicable to everyone.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency, LLC", "description": "You\u2019re never going to create a system where some parents won\u2019t do anything and everything to help their kids.
