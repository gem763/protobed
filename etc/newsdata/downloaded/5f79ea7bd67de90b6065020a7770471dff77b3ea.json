The Astros won 6-1, jumping on Tampa Bay for four first-inning runs then never looking back at Cole\u2019s ever-steady presence on the mound made the Rays looked overmatched for the second time in the series. He struck out 10 batters, an MLB record 11 straight games for Cole with double-digit strikeouts.\n\nHowever, another record streak ended when Cole failed to record a third-inning strikeout.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn the 3rd inning, Gerrit Cole didn't record a strikeout.\n\n\n\nWhy is that significant?\n\n\n\nCole had recorded at least 1 strikeout in 73 consecutive innings (reg. and postseason) dating back to Aug. 1.\n\n\n\nIt was the longest such streak in the Expansion Era (since 1961)....by 33 innings. \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 11, 2019\n\nNow we get the ALCS that baseball fans everywhere had been looking forward to: The 107-win Astros against the 103-win Yankees, a clash for the AL pennant that might be a more titanic battle than what will follow in the World Series. It\u2019s two teams with potent lineups that can score plenty of runs and dynamic pitchers, although Houston\u2019s start games and the Yankees\u2019 finish them.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the historically dominant performance of Game 2 for Cole \u2014 who whiffed 15 Rays batters that night \u2014 but it was still really, really good. You can\u2019t spot a pitcher like Cole run fours in an elimination game and expect to move to the next round.\n\nThe Astros jumped on Rays starter Tyler Glasnow immediately. George Springer, Michael Brantley and Jose Altuve hit consecutive singles to start the time, Altuve\u2019s bringing the first run in. MVP candidate Alex Bregman came up next and doubled to score two more runs. Then Yuli Gurriel brought home Bregman two batters later. The Astros bats were kept quiet until the eighth inning when Brantley and Altuve hit back-to-back homers.\n\nThe Rays, meanwhile, only mustered two hits off Cole through seven innings. One of them was a second-inning homer from Eric Sogard that seemed to immediately answer the Astros rally, but nothing else came from it. Cole struck out 10 on 107 pitches, walked just two and managed to avoid any kind of drama. Even at pitch No. 100 \u2014 which notched his ninth strikeout \u2014 Cole was pumping 99 mph.\n\nIt was everything the Astros could have asked for in a Game 5.\n\nGerrit Cole pitched the Astros into the ALCS with 10 strikeouts in Game 5 against the Rays.

He\u2019s no stranger to getting big hits and performing in the postseason. He can add the two-run double to the list of achievements in his already decorated career at 25 years old.\n\n\u2022 Gerrit Cole: It\u2019s pretty clear he was the main difference-maker in this game, but also the series. He combined to strike out a division series record 25 Rays batters in his two starts and allowed just one run. As close as this series was, there\u2019s no doubt that Cole would be the MVP of this series were that an award that was given in the first round.\n\n\u2022 The Rays bullpen: Give credit to the Rays bullpen. They kept this game from getting ugly. Seven Rays relievers held the Astros to just one hit between the first inning and eighth, when the Astros hit back-to-back homers. If the Rays\u2019 offense had been able to get anything going against Cole, their bullpen could have been heroes.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nThe Astros couldn\u2019t do it without the bats too. Here are the back-to-back daggers from Brantley and Altuve in the eighth.\n\nMichael Brantley and Jose Altuve with back-to-back daggers.\n\n\n\n(Via @MLBONFOX)pic.twitter.com/RQhJVwZlId \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 11, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nThe question is whether the Astros benefited from Glasnow tipping his pitches. Camera caught Bregman telling his teammates something about what Glasnow was doing on the mound. A few different ex-MLB players were tweeting in the first inning about how Glasnow has a reputation for tipping pitches. The Astros are smart, we know that, so they could have certainly jumped on the clues they were given.\n\nSince the Rays bullpen did well after Glasnow was pulled, it\u2019s worth wondering whether the supposed pitch tipping cost the Rays a chance to play in the ALCS.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nThe Astros and Yankees meet Saturday for Game 1 in Houston. The Yankees enter the series fully rested and would have their pick of Luis Severino and James Paxton to start, but manager Aaron Boone said Wednesday he hadn\u2019t decided yet. The Astros would presumably start Zack Greinke in Game 1, since he\u2019d be next in their rotation. Greinke got beat up by the Rays in Game 3 of the ALDS, but the Astros need him to set the tone in the ALCS after having to use Cole and Justin Verlander twice. First pitch is at 8:08 p.m. ET with TV coverage on Fox.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip? Email him at mikeozstew@yahoo.com or follow him on Twitter!
