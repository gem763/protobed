But even as rains receded and gave way to clear skies, the authorities failed to clear the water-logged areas for well over a week and this revealed their incompetence as well as unpreparedness in dealing with a crisis that ravages many parts of the down-trodden state on an annual basis.\n\nAbout two weeks later, the residents of Patna are up in arms against the apathy of the state and their failure in containing the flood situation even as reports of Dengue and Chikangunia are now surfacing at an alarming rate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey faced the severe ire of helpless flood victims of Bihar when two youth threw ink on him as a sign of protest over what is being seen as the government\u2019s inaction in controlling the flood.\n\nChoubey represents Buxar constituency and was on an inspection visit to the Patna Medical College and Hospital where several dengue patients have been admitted. As he was about to enter into his vehicle, two people threw ink at him to register their protest.\n\nDon't Miss 105 SHARES 115 SHARES 11.8 K SHARES 8.1 K SHARES 13.8 K SHARES\n\n#WATCH Bihar: A man threw ink on Union Minister of State for Health & Family Welfare Ashwini Choubey while he was visiting dengue patients at Patna Medical College & Hospital. The man managed to escape. Minister says \"Ink thrown on public, democracy and the pillar of democracy.\" pic.twitter.com/gVxsfdLz8d \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 15, 2019\n\nThe reason behind the apparent anger of the people is because the stalwart politicians from the state are indulging in blame game and shedding off their collective failure from preventing the trail of deaths and destruction that continues to thwart the daily life in the state.\n\nThe state capital of Patna is still faced with numerous hardships apart from the loss of life and property that the city suffered. The situation has been blamed on malfunctioning pumps by authorities, who now say they hope to pump out most of inundated parts by this weekend.\n\nIn the meanwhile, hundreds of people have staged several rounds of protests against the state government for its mishandling of the crisis. Dozens of roads were blocked and slogans critical of the ruling dispensation -- the JDU-BJP alliance -- were raised vociferously by the people whose lives continues to hang in balance even now.\n\nPeople are losing their cool and composure as the saga of devastation is coupled with lack of accountability and frequent blame games. The ink attack on a Union Minister was one of the ways in which this anger manifested itself but even earlier, several episodes of people losing their cool has surfaced in the state.\n\nThese are the officials who have been held 'accountable' by Nitish's government for #patnafloods. No IAS officer, no neta, just junior employees. Such a hopeless state, metaphorically and literally. pic.twitter.com/BcLE1fyyRw \u2014 Abhinandan Mishra (@mishra_abhi) October 15, 2019\n\nAccording to IANS, a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) was attacked by angry flood victims in Bhagalpur district but was rescued by security guards. SDM Ashish Narayan was attacked by flood victims in Navtolia village when he was on a visit to assess the flood situation.\n\nState Deputy CM was himself evacuated by NDRF but people are blaming him in the choicest of words and have begun to ask if he couldn\u2019t secure himself, his family and his neighbours, how would he guarantee the safety of an entire state under his command. Sushil Modi had reportedly closed his window when the neighbours sought his help and protests have now reached his front yard.\n\nPatna: Locals of Rajendra Nagar area protested outside the residence of Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar Sushil Kumar Modi over recent water-logging and floods in the city. pic.twitter.com/JiU5AABaGo \u2014 ANI (@ANI) October 13, 2019\n\nFurther, the residents of Patna are also complaining that the authorities that just a couple of days ago, the traffic cops were at almost every road of the city to challan people but they were nowhere to be found when all roads have been choked by water-logging. A police official was also reportedly beaten up by residents in the Rajendra Nagar area of Patna.\n\nWatch this frustration of this guy with Patna floods....but is BJP or Modi entirely responsible for the state of Patna as its today?! Residents too have a responsibility...@rsprasad @BJP4Bihar @NitishKumar @SushilModi @JhaSanjay @TVMohandasPai @GouravVallabh pic.twitter.com/YwW146WsZ2 \u2014 Digital Nagrik (@diginagrik) October 14, 2019\n\nThe saga of protests and manifestations of anger will continue to surface in the coming weeks too but Patna needs immediate help to overcome the damages it suffered earlier this month. The spread of Dengue and other diseases is a major fear even as people are struggling to bring their lives back on track now.\n\nFEATURED MIMAGE CREDIT: ANI", "description": "Three days of incessant rain plunged the historic city of Patna into massive floods as most residential areas were submerged knee-deep under the water.
