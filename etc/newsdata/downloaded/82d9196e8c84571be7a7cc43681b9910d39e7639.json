We\u2019re taking action wherever we can to ensure we\u2019re removing unnecessary packaging and making sure all of our packaging is as sustainable as possible.\"", "description": "The Budweiser Brewing Group has announced plans to phase out single-use plastic pack rings from its entire range of UK beers by the end of 2020.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/11/beer-cans.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
