It began the day with a one-game lead over Milwaukee for the top spot in the NL wild-card standings.\n\nManager Dave Martinez rejoined the Nationals following a heart procedure that caused him to miss a three-game series at St. Louis. The 54-year-old was back in the dugout four days after a cardiac catheterization.\n\nBefore Miami\u2019s 100th loss, the team announced manager Don Mattingly had agreed to a two-year extension. Mattingly was in the final season of a four-year contract.\n\nThe Marlins became the third team to lose 100 games this season, joining the Baltimore Orioles and Detroit Tigers. Miami also had 100-loss seasons in 1998 and 2013.\n\nThe Nationals grabbed the lead for good on Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera\u2019s three-run homer off Robert Dugger (0-3) in the fourth inning.\n\nTurner\u2019s 15th homer gave Washington a 1-0 lead in the third. After Miami pulled within one in the sixth, Turner connected against Ryne Stanke in the seventh.\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez (10-8) pitched five-plus innings to reach double-figure victories for the fifth time in his career. Sanchez allowed four runs and six hits.\n\nFernando Rodney pitched a perfect seventh and Daniel Hudson got six outs for his fifth save in nine opportunities.\n\nStarlin Castro homered for Miami and finished with three hits. Isan D\u00edaz and Jon Berti each had two hits and drove in a run.\n\nDugger was charged with four runs and three hits in five innings in his sixth major league start.\n\nVictor Robles\u2019 RBI single gave Washington a 5-2 lead in the sixth, but Miami rallied in the bottom half. D\u00edaz singled home Neil Walker, and Castro scampered home on reliever Wander Suero\u2019s errant pickoff throw to first.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nNationals: 1B Matt Adams (sprained shoulder) continues to take batting practice but without a timeline for his return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nNationals: RHP Stephen Strasburg (17-6, 3.49 ERA) has a 21-7 career record against Miami, including 3-0 this season.\n\nMarlins: RHP Jordan Yamamoto (4-5, 4.87 ERA) will make his first start since being activated from the injured list. Yamamoto was sidelined because of a right forearm strain.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Trea Turner hit two solo homers, and the Washington Nationals beat the Miami Marlins 6-4 on Friday night.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/20/nationals_marlins_baseball_88749_c0-187-4496-2808_s1770x1032.jpg?8fcd48afcc4bc89ecdd59e254fc5cd0d64cb4de4", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
