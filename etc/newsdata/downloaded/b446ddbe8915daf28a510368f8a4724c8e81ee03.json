The president shared a quote from a Fox News interview with Rep. John Ratliffe (R-Texas) during which he claimed the Ukrainians were never aware on July 25 \u2014 the date of Trump's phone call with Zelensky \u2014 that the military aid was being withheld and that there couldn\u2019t be a quid pro quo \u201cwith no quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Do Nothing Dems case is DEAD!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nTaylor in his opening statement cited conversations between U.S. officials and Ukraine leadership about the money being delayed after the phone call.\n\nTaylor testimony puts scrutiny on Sondland\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony appears to contradict that of Sondland, and has drawn more scrutiny on the E.U. diplomat. Democrats say they now call Sondland to testify again, with some lawmakers threatening to refer him to the Justice Department for perjury.\n\n\u201cAfter today, Mr. Sondland is going to have some explaining to do,\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi Subramanian (Raja) Raja KrishnamoorthiOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Diplomat who raised Ukraine concerns to testify in Trump impeachment probe MORE (D-Ill.), a member of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters after emerging from Taylor\u2019s deposition.\n\nSondland had testified last week that, after consulting with Trump, he was informed there was no quid pro quo arrangement involving the Ukraine aid. The wealthy Seattle hotelier and major Trump donor repeated that assertion in a text message to Taylor on Sept. 9.\n\nBut Taylor told lawmakers Tuesday that Sondland himself had told Taylor by phone that \u201ceverything,\u201d including the military aid, was contingent on Ukraine publicly announcing the political investigations.\n\n\u201cDuring our call on September 8, Ambassador Sondland tried to explain to me that President Trump is a businessman,\u201d Taylor told congressional investigators.\n\n\u201cWhen a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something, he said, the businessman asks that person to pay up before singing the check.\u201d\n\nAnd Taylor indicated that despite insisting there was no quid pro quo in conversations, there was still an expectation relayed to Ukraine that the aid was contingent on public commitments from Zelensky to investigate Biden and 2016.\n\nTaylor also named other individuals who could corroborate his account. He described a phone call with Tim Morrison, a top White House National Security Council official, who told him that Sondland had a conversation about a quid pro quo with a top representative for President Zelensky, Andriy Yermak.\n\n\u201cDuring this same phone call I had with Mr. Morrison, he went on to describe a conversation Ambassador Sondland had with Mr. Yermak ...\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cAmbassador Sondland told Mr. Yermak that the security assistance money would not come until President Zelenskyy committed to pursue the Burisma investigation.\u201d\n\nNew details offered on shadow diplomacy led by Giuliani\n\nTaylor gave lawmakers new and explicit details about the involvement of the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiOvernight Defense: Trump's Syria envoy wasn't consulted on withdrawal | McConnell offers resolution urging Trump to rethink Syria | Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Democrats say they have game changer on impeachment READ: Diplomat describes pressure put on Ukraine to open 'investigations' MORE, in government business, describing \u201ctwo channels\u201d for carrying out foreign policy in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making U.S. policy toward Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThere appeared to be two channels of U.S. policy-making and implementation, one regular and one highly irregular.\u201d\n\nThe regular channel was led by diplomatic staff in Ukraine while the irregular channel involved Giuilani, Volker, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry Rick PerryDemocrats say they have game changer on impeachment Diplomat says Ukraine aid was tied to political investigations Putin, Hungarian leader pushed Trump on Ukraine corruption narrative: reports MORE, Taylor said. Giuliani in particular appeared to be tied directly to efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\n\u201cBy mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections,\u201d Taylor testified. \u201cIt was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel I had come to understand was guided by Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has openly acknowledged seeking damaging information on Biden. He has become further ensnared in Democrats\u2019 investigation after two of his associates were arrested for alleged campaign finance law violations.\n\nSen.

There, he witnessed the aggression of Russian-led fighters first hand.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Volker and I could see the hostile Russian-led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact,\u201d Taylor recalled.\n\nHe expressed worry that withholding nearly $400 million in aid, which aimed to combat Russian aggression in Ukraine, would lead to more lives lost. And he emphasized that the U.S. must help Ukraine \u201cin its fight against its bullying neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver 13,000 Ukrainians had been killed in the war, one or two a week. More Ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the U.S. assistance,\u201d his opening remarks read.", "description": "William Taylor, the top U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/taylorwilliam_082719getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
