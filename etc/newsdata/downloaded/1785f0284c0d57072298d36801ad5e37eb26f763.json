They loved the cinema, and would go all the time as a young couple. My mum had a crush on the young Marlon Brando after seeing him in On The Waterfront and as Mark Antony in Julius Caesar. But it was my dad who was the more voluble about film, if not necessarily the more opinionated.\n\nAlbert Desmond Bradshaw came to London from Belfast in the 1950s to be a photographer. That was where he met my mum, Mollie, who was working as a secretary. They lived in Highgate, north London and were a hip couple-about-town before my sister, Sarah, and I came along; they then moved to a cottage in Letchmore Heath, near Watford. If I had to cast Dad in a film, I\u2019d suggest Adrian Dunbar \u2013 although Dad was tall and beanpole-thin when we were growing up, with an expression of droll disapproval, which we loved as kids, but found infuriating as stroppy teenagers. He loved watching films on TV with us and, to everyone\u2019s rage, talking over the dialogue when he semi-recognised an actor: \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026! That\u2019s\u2026! Come on, Peter, you know, who is it?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Albert and Peter Bradshaw at the latter\u2019s graduation.

I\u2019ll never forget being about 10 or 11 with Sarah at the dinner table, and asking my parents about a film called Psycho, which I had seen in the TV listings. (It sounded like something I would buy at the shops, like Rolo or Toffo.) Dad launched into a description of the first bit of the film, including Anthony Perkins spying on the naked Janet Leigh in the shower. He even asked me and Sarah if we understood why he should want to be spying on her. My memory is that we nodded, dumbly, but for all we knew of nightmarish sexual obsession and misogynistic violence, Dad could have been describing a tea-making ceremony on Pluto. The discussion ended there. I had no idea what the later, legendary \u201cshower\u201d scene was like until I watched the film as a student.\n\nMy dad told me to watch the 1949 Ealing classic Kind Hearts And Coronets, directed by Robert Hamer, with Dennis Price as the serial killer Louis, elegantly murdering members of the aristocratic D\u2019Ascoyne family (all played by Alec Guinness) so he can become duke. It seemed to be on TV all the time in the 70s. My dad adored the scene in which young photographer Henry D\u2019Ascoyne and Louis exchange camera chat outside the country pub. (\u201cExcuse me. Isn\u2019t that a Thornton Pickard? \u2013 Yes. Are you a photographer? \u2013 Dabble in it. Got a Sanger Shepherd!\u201d)\n\nBefore setting up in photography on his own, Dad was assistant to the noted photographer Maurice Broomfield, who recorded postwar industrial Britain and was the father of the documentary film-maker Nick Broomfield. Dad took a lot of photographs for the Financial Times in the 50s, but they are untraceable, because they are uncredited, or credited only to Maurice \u2013 but I still own a cache of amazing photographs that he took of postwar streetlife in France.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mollie, Sarah, Albert and Peter Bradshaw, 1965. Photograph: courtesy of Peter Bradshaw\n\nHow thrilled Dad would be as we watched Kind Hearts And Coronets on TV \u2013 particularly the scene in the darkroom, which Louis plans as the site of Henry\u2019s murder. Dad\u2019s darkroom was next to my bedroom: as mysterious and wonderful (and inaccessible) as Aladdin\u2019s cave, full of strange chemicals and occult technical devices. Much later on, when I recorded the audio commentary for the DVD edition with Terence Davies and Matthew Guinness (son of Alec), I was almost speechless with unexpressed emotion. We recorded it four years after Dad died of cancer. It was the nearest I could come to a s\u00e9ance, recalling my dad\u2019s spirit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A photo Albert took of Montmartre, Paris, 1950. Photograph: courtesy of Peter Bradshaw\n\nWhat Dad would have thought of one of my favourite films, Raging Bull, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m reasonably sure he never saw Martin Scorsese\u2019s 1980 portrayal of the brutal, emotionally self-harming real-life boxer Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro. I don\u2019t think he would have liked it. The first time I saw it, as a teenager, I got Dad to pick me up from the cinema (the Screen on the Hill in north London, now the Everyman). It was electrifying, yet it wasn\u2019t the boxing but the theatricality and sacrifice in the ring that appealed to me. When I asked Dad if he remembered Jake LaMotta, he replied: \u201cJust a brawler.\u201d He was interested in boxing as a young man and, he told me, often went to fights as a teenager with his friends in Ulster Hall in Belfast. They would smoke (the way they would in the cinema) and laugh at the ref\u2019s laconic dismissal of whingeing fighters: \u201cBox on!\u201d \u2013 a phrase he himself would use in his strong Belfast accent if my sister or I claimed to have been hurt in a squabble.\n\nDad loved the cinema, but hardly ever went. It was a habit that belonged to his youth. He watched movies on TV avidly, and in the 80s he would rent clunky video cassettes or record films off the TV and nerdishly write the films\u2019 titles along the video\u2019s spine. As a boy in Belfast, though, he and his brothers went all the time \u2013 at a time when the city had 40 movie theatres \u2013 often to the Curzon on the Ormeau Road, which was later bombed to smithereens in the Troubles. He was obsessed with the psychological drama Gaslight, directed by George Cukor. \u201cPaula!\u201d he would mysteriously boom from the dinner table to my mum in the kitchen \u2013 impersonating Charles Boyer\u2019s sonorous French voice, with a hint of Belfast. Mum would laugh (Sarah and I were baffled).\n\nThe strange thing is, Dad was a kind of film-maker. He loved home movies, and had a beautiful Bolex Super 8 cine camera. Yet he scorned people who just showed their raw, silent footage. He had an 8mm film editor and the Bolex technology allowed him to create a sound strip. He filmed my sister and I playing badminton at the caravan park on holiday, and on the beach, having our packed lunch. Later, he put on music, sound effects from the LP borrowed from the public library (\u201cwaves breaking\u201d, superimposed on a shot of the surf, was eerily effective) and added voiceover in a heart-rendingly careful enunciation that made him sound like a Belfast Jacques Cousteau. He even had a go at recording speech, taping me with our vintage cassette recorder, and doing a clapperboard-style hand clap in front of the camera to synchronise sound and image. \u201cThanks, Pete!\u201d he would say afterwards, with an air of reserve. As an actor, I think I did not entirely satisfy the director. We still have the Super 8 reels, transferred to DVDs. They play like remembered dreams. But watching them without the stuttering rattle of the projector isn\u2019t as good.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Albert Bradshaw aged 22, in Paris, 1950. Photograph: courtesy of Peter Bradshaw\n\nThe only family visit to the cinema was in 1975, to see Sidney Lumet\u2019s Murder On The Orient Express, starring Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot; it was showing at the now-vanished Watford Empire. Dad professed to be astonished at how clean and fresh the scuzzy auditorium looked. He said the cinemas of his boyhood were like boxing halls, every surface furred with fag-ash and the screen images flavoured with cigarette smoke. I asked him afterwards what he thought of the film. \u201cOh, pretty good hokum!\u201d he grinned \u2013 his habitual term of approval for anything.\n\n'The first time we met was gut-wrenchingly awkward': can you be friends with your partner's ex?

That image is not the real world, but a celluloid enhancement, a London-set black-and-white romantic drama directed by Robert Hamer or No\u00ebl Coward. The final scene is a shot of thirtysomething Mum and Dad in the front of our family car (an elderly Ford Cortina estate), looking out at the camera through the windscreen, with me and Sarah in the back, as Dad puts the car in gear and we set off on holiday or a trip to my grandparents as the credits roll.\n\n\u2022 The Films That Made Me...
