Banegas said he believed they were arrested around June 6.\n\nThe scholars kept Marchal's imprisonment confidential at the recommendation of the Foreign Ministry, even after Adelkhah's detention became public.\n\nIranian authorities have previously rejected French authorities' requests for consular access to Adelkhah because Iran does not recognize dual nationality for its citizens.\n\nAdelkhah often travels to Iran for her research, which examines post-revolutionary Iranian society. Marchal's research does not relate to Iran; his work analyzes conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly Somalia, Chad, Central African Republic and Mali.\n\nMarchal and Adelkhah have been in a long-term romantic relationship, according to Banegas, and Marchal was visiting Adelkhah on a purely social trip at the time of his arrest.\n\n\"Nothing justifies the incarceration of Fariba Adelkhah and Roland Marchal. Their activities were strictly academic, they have no connection whatsoever to any intelligence service, and they do not carry out any political activity in Iran,\" the researchers wrote in their statement.\n\nThe arrests came as tensions in the Persian Gulf ratcheted up in June. French President Emmanuel Macron has sought to serve as a mediator between Tehran and Washington.", "description": "The Iranian government has been holding a French researcher in custody for four months, the second French academic held in Iran at a time of high tensions and diplomatic maneuvering in the Persian Gulf.
