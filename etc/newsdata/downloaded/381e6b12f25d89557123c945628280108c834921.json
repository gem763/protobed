(Photo: Netflix)\n\nThe 2019 edition of Fantastic Fest, which wrapped up yesterday, once again lived up to its name. Over the course of several days I saw movie after movie and, after 19 total, there was only one I considered \u201cbad.\u201d That\u2019s pretty fantastic.\n\nEverything about Fantastic Fest this year lived up to that standard though. You rarely heard about movies people didn\u2019t like. Everything was at least OK. And good movies meant good vibes all around. Great conversations. Excellent food, drink, everything you can think of. The secret screenings, Dolemite Is My Name and The Lighthouse, were also stellar, even if neither was what everyone really wanted: Cats.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to acknowledge 19 films out of the entire festival is but a mere fraction of all the films screened. I missed buzzed-about films like The Platform and Synchronic, and films like Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite and Rian Johnson\u2019s Knives Out, which screened after I\u2019d already left. So we can\u2019t say definitively these were the best movies at the festival. They\u2019re just just our favourites out of everything we saw. Either way though, you should definitely keep them on your radar.\n\n1. In the Shadow of the Moon\n\n\u201cIn the Shadow of the Moon is an excellent blend of sci-fi, drama, and action. It has good character work in a complex, mysterious story, with set pieces that maybe aren\u2019t the biggest, but drive the action forward and still manage to entertain.\u201d\n\nYou Don't See Many Sci-Fi Murder Mysteries As Good As In The Shadow Of The Moon Every nine years, a mysterious killer resurfaces for one day only. The victims die from a disease no one has ever seen and their deaths appear to be unrelated. And yet, one man is obsessed enough to keep investigating the case, every nine years. Read more\n\n2. Sweetheart\n\n\u201cA mysterious, exciting, engrossing movie that proves popcorn movies come in all shapes and sizes, and sometimes several contradicting shapes and sizes at the same time.\u201d\n\nCastaway And Predator Get A Beautiful, Poignant Mix In The New Film Sweetheart Titling a movie about a woman stranded on an island that may or may not be infested with monsters Sweetheart doesn\u2019t seem right. The title gives no clear indication of what\u2019s about to unfold. And so you watch, wondering, why is this the title of this movie? Then the reason hits you. Read more\n\n3. Butt Boy\n\n\u201cDoes it involve butts? Very much so. However, it does so in a way that\u2019s so audacious and silly, and yet is handled so seriously and dramatically, it\u2019s almost unfathomable, in the best possible way.\u201d\n\nYou Have Never, Ever Seen A Movie Like Butt Boy When you hear a movie is called Butt Boy, we all think the same thing. Either it\u2019s a porno or it\u2019s a gross-out comedy. And yet the new film, Butt Boy, is not that. Does it involve butts? Very much so. However, it does so in a way that\u2019s so audacious and silly, and yet is handled so seriously and dramatically, it\u2019s almost unfathomable, in the best possible way. Read more\n\n4. Jojo Rabbit\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll make you smile, it\u2019ll make you sad, and it\u2019ll make you believe in the best of us.\u201d\n\nJojo Rabbit Is Taika Waititi's Most Emotional Film To Date After films like What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and even Thor: Ragnarok, we have a pretty good idea of what a Taika Waititi movie is going to be. It\u2019s going to be weird. It\u2019s going to be funny. And it\u2019s going to wear its heart on its sleeve. With his latest film, Jojo Rabbit, all of those things are once again true but, of all Waititi\u2019s previous movies, it\u2019s probably has the biggest heart of them all. And the fact Waititi found that in the middle of comedy where he plays Adolf Fucking Hitler seems just about right. Read more\n\n5. The Vast of Night\n\n\u201cThe feature debut of director Andrew Patterson...blends elements of The Twilight Zone and Orson Welles\u2019 War of the Worlds in a taut, captivating alien invasion film told in real-time.\u201d\n\nThe Vast Of Night Is An Expertly Crafted Sci-Fi Period Piece The whole world can change in the time it takes to play a high school basketball game. That\u2019s exactly what happens in The Vast of Night, the feature debut of director Andrew Patterson, which blends elements of The Twilight Zone and Orson Welles\u2019 War of the Worlds in a taut, captivating alien invasion film told in real-time.

The True Adventures of Wolfboy\n\n\u201cFeaturing supporting performances by Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and a few other surprise stars, The True Adventures of Wolfboy feels so much bigger than a mere festival movie.\u201d\n\nThe True Adventures Of Wolfboy Is A Heartwarming Coming-of-Age Delight Don\u2019t let the title fool you. There are no wolves in The True Adventures of Wolfboy. There are adventures, though \u2014 lots of them, as a young man with a unique affliction finds out that the world may be terrible, but good people can make it OK. Read more\n\n7. The Lighthouse\n\n\u201cThe purest joy it provides is watching two stellar actors engaging in psychological warfare for the duration of the film.\u201d Read more:\n\nThe Lighthouse Is A Manic, Weird Film And We Loved It If watching Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe fuck with each other for two hours in black and white sounds like your idea of a good time, The Lighthouse may be for you. There\u2019s much more to the film, obviously, but the purest joy it provides is watching two stellar actors engaging in psychological warfare for the duration of the film. Read more\n\n8. Vivarium\n\n\u201c[Lorcan] Finnegan has a winner with Vivarium. It might be a little full of itself but it\u2019s so mysterious, odd, and well-made that it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nVivarium Makes Buying A House A Bigger Nightmare Than It Already Is Buying a house sucks, but it has never, ever been as bad as it is in Vivarium. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots star as a couple looking for a new home. A mysterious real estate agent then takes them to a very, very uniform neighbourhood and strands them there, with no way to leave. Read more\n\n9. Memory: The Origins of Alien\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of Alien or science fiction at all, you may not want it to end.\u201d\n\nMemory: The Origins Of Alien Dives Deeper Into A Classic Than You Could Possibly Imagine A movie like Alien doesn\u2019t just come out of nowhere. There\u2019s the screenplay, the director\u2019s vision, and a massive combination of artistic endeavours from people who do the costumes, the lighting, and everything in between. And that\u2019s the basic knowledge of filmmaking where most dissections of a movie\u2019s origin end. Memory: The Origins of Alien goes so far beyond that it borders on excess. Read more\n\n10. Sea Fever\n\n\u201cSea Fever takes Alien\u2019s DNA and grounds it in reality, constructing a way to make such a scenario actually plausible. It\u2019s creepy and entertaining...\u201d\n\nCalling Sea Fever 'Alien On The Ocean' Is Partially Accurate, But Slightly Unfair While the simplest way to describe the new film Sea Fever is \u201cAlien on the ocean,\u201d let\u2019s get something out of the way. It is not Alien on the ocean. OK, yes, Sea Fever is about a group of people on a ship who begin to be picked off by a mysterious creature. Also, like Alien, Sea Fever has an incredible lead character played by an up-and-coming actress. But Sea Fever takes Alien\u2019s DNA and grounds it in reality, constructing a way to make such a scenario actually plausible. It\u2019s creepy and entertaining, but never quite rises above that.
