Two notable spills came from two of the three Barrett brothers. First from lock Scott in the first half having already crossed the try line, then from fullback Beauden in the final seconds of play as he galloped towards the posts.\n\nCanada never had a hope heading in to this match and it is difficult to gauge its performance against the game's undisputed superpower. The North Americans saw just 35 percent of the ball, ran a paltry 228 meters \u2014 compared to the 849 meters amassed by the Kiwis \u2014 and were asked to make 148 tackles.
