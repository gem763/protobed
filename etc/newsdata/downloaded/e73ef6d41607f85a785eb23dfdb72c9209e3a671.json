Trump has called for an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s business ventures in Ukraine.\n\nHouse Democrats in their impeachment inquiry are investigating whether Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into opening an investigation into the Bidens. Trump has not provided any evidence of criminal wrongdoing by either Biden.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMy son\u2019s comments speak for themselves. Let\u2019s keep the focus here. The president of the United States says he wants to talk about corruption. Well, let\u2019s talk about corruption. He is running the most corrupt government in the history of the United States of America, number one. Number two, he also is in a position where, as he talks about corruption, he is engaged in practices that, in fact, everyone around the world is looking and saying \u2018how in God\u2019s name can this man be doing that while he\u2019s president?\u2019\u201d Biden said.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you want to talk about corruption,\u201d Biden continued. \u201cI\u2019ve released 21 years of my tax returns. I entered as one of the poorest men in Congress, left one of the poorest men in government, in Congress, and as vice president. I made no money while I was in there other than my salary. Mr. President, even Richard Nixon released his tax returns. Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up.\u201d\n\n\"Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up,\" says former VP Joe Biden as he accused Trump of running a \"corrupt government\" and defended his son Hunter's Ukraine work.https://t.co/Oz9SORJCCA pic.twitter.com/G2I6om1LJT \u2014 CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) October 16, 2019\n\nBiden said he would not change anything about his son\u2019s former position on the board of a Ukrainian gas company and that he did not discuss the country with him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on what the problem is here. The problem is a corrupt president. The reason why he is running after me is he knows I will beat him like a drum,\u201d Biden added. \u201cHe understands that.\u201d\n\nBiden also blasted President Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani Rudy GiulianiGiuliani urged Trump to eject exiled Turkish cleric from US: report State Dept. official told to 'lay low' after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker White House, Pentagon, Giuliani reject House subpoenas MORE among others. Several of Giuliani\u2019s associates have been arrested in the last week for allegedly violating campaign finance laws.\n\n\u201cThis is so obvious. And as I said, Rudy Giuliani and the henchmen and Trump\u2019s lawyers? How many of these folks are in jail? These are the president\u2019s people for God\u2019s sake, this is a thoroughly corrupt outfit,\u201d Biden alleged.\n\nTrump told reporters that he did not know the men last week, calling them \u201cclients of Rudy\u2019s.\u201d", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden lashed out at President Trump at a campaign stop in Columbus, Ohio, on Wednesday,\u00a0calling on him to \u201crelease your tax returns or shut up.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_bidenjoe_101019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
