President Donald Trump can\u2019t do that: He has to rely on his base \u2014 a far more divisive strategy.\n\nTrump defends pressuring Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens as part of his job \u2014 just politics as usual. He tweeted, \u201cI have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not politics as usual says Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee: \u201cEncouraging a foreign nation to interfere to help his campaign by investigating a rival is a fundamental breach of the president\u2019s oath of office.\u201d The chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission, a Democrat, warned that \u201cIt is illegal for any person to solicit or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt\u2019s an impeachable offense.\n\nIf President Trump Donald John TrumpGiuliani says he is unaware of reported federal investigation Louisiana's Democratic governor forced into runoff Lawmakers focus their ire on NBA, not China MORE is making a play for public opinion, it\u2019s not working. In the Washington Post-Schar School poll, a strong majority (62 percent) called President Trump\u2019s request to the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens \u201cinappropriate.\u201d But the White House may not be making a play for public opinion. The president expects to survive by relying on his base.\n\nMobilizing the base requires exploiting the country\u2019s deep political division. So far, it seems to be working. Trump supporters don\u2019t see any crime in what the president did. By about two to one (59 to 33 percent), Republicans call President Trump\u2019s request to Ukraine \u201cappropriate.\u201d\n\nWith a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, impeachment may be inevitable. But conviction is not. Democrats have 47 votes in the Senate (45 Democrats plus two independents who caucus with the Democrats). At least 20 Republican senators would have to join them to convict and remove President Trump, since a two-thirds majority is required.\n\nTrump\u2019s army makes up less than one third of the public (the 29 percent who \u201cstrongly approve\u201d of the job he is doing as president). But they account for more than two-thirds of Republican voters. That\u2019s enough to dominate GOP primaries. They are Trump\u2019s army, and they will follow the president\u2019s orders to bring down any Republican senator who gets out of line.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, a Trump critic who chose not to run for re-election last year, says \u201cThere is no love for the president among Senate Republicans.\u201d What there is is fear \u2014 \u201ca concern that he\u2019ll get through it and exact revenge on those who didn\u2019t stand with him.\u201d\n\nBill Clinton was saved by the polls. When the story of his affair with Monica Lewinsky broke in January 1998, congressional Democrats were shocked. Few of them were willing to defend President Clinton publicly \u2014 until the polls started coming out.\n\nClinton delivered his State of the Union speech on January 27, 1998, one week after the Lewinsky story came out. He spoke for nearly 90 minutes without mentioning the scandal. President Clinton laid out a centrist policy agenda on social security, trade, education, welfare reform, health care and fiscal discipline (\u201cWe must not go back to unwise spending or untargeted tax cuts that risk reopening the deficit\u201d). The message: I intend to do my job.\n\nAnd guess what happened? Clinton\u2019s approval ratings soared, from 59 percent just before the State of the Union to 69 percent just after. Suddenly his fellow Democrats rushed forward to defend Clinton on television and on the House floor when they saw that it was safe. President Clinton spoke as little as possible about the scandal for the next year. His approval ratings remained sky high until he was acquitted by the Senate in February 1999. That\u2019s when his ratings dropped back down. Voters no longer had to save him.\n\nTrump can\u2019t follow the Clinton strategy for survival. Trump\u2019s approval rating has never even reached 50 percent. Trump has to survive by dividing the country \u2014 \u201cus\u201d versus \u201cthem.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t need the larger electorate as long as his base remains loyal and enthusiastic. It\u2019s a poisonous political strategy driven by endless political rallies. One week Minneapolis and Lake Charles, La. The next week, Dallas.\n\nTrump can\u2019t ignore impeachment the way Clinton did. He has to dwell on it as a constant, looming threat. His base will stand by him unless they see him as betraying them. That\u2019s why Trump pays so much attention to keeping his campaign promises \u2014 the wall, the tax cut, ending troop commitments overseas.\n\nThe New York Times recently interviewed an anti-abortion voter who opposed Trump in 2016 in favor of Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee. Now she says, \u201cI\u2019m not sure those guys I love and admire would have had the guts to do what Trump has done.\u201d She called Trump \u201ca street fighter\u201d and \u201ca gutsy New Yorker\u201d \u2014 \u201cthe guy who puts the knife in his teeth and swims the moat.\u201d\n\nI once asked a religious right activist whether he admired Trump\u2019s behavior. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want him to be my Sunday school teacher,\u201d he responded, \u201cbut I will support him till the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBecause he delivers,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cWhat has he delivered?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThe thing we have been praying for for 50 years,\u201d he answered. \u201cThe Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d\n\nBill Schneider is a professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and author of \u2018Standoff: How America Became Ungovernable\u2019 (Simon & Schuster).", "description": "President Bill Clinton relied on public opinion to save his presidency.
