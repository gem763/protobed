More specifically, look at the chip sector where a stock like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is up 70% in 2019 despite the ongoing trade war.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis is a slap in the face to all fearmongers scaring investors out of owning great stocks just because the U.S. and China are negotiating a trade deal in a less than ideal setting.\n\nThese headlines wreak havoc in AMD and the VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) as a whole. While the stock prices go for a ride, their fundamentals remain intact. In fact the demand for AMD products and services has a runway at least a decade long. And as long as they have strong management like they have with current CEO Lisa Su, then there is no reason to sell the stock over short-term fears.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSure, a tweet here or a media headline there could get the traders\u2019 attentions, but it\u2019s not a reason alone to change the investment thesis for the stock. There is no evidence yet that the US and China won\u2019t eventually come to terms. So the prospects for AMD stock remain bullish.\n\nAMD Stock Is Still the Top Chip Stock\n\nIf I own AMD already, then I\u2019m staying long. Otherwise, I treat the dips as opportunities to buy AMD stock for the long term. It has performed most consistently in the sector even last year when markets were correcting hard.\n\nFundamentally, it\u2019s not cheap but that doesn\u2019t matter. AMD is still a growth company, so when I evaluate those types I don\u2019t look for profitability. Instead, I need them to grow a lot. And in order to do that they need to spend a lot. Moreover, AMD stock sells at only 5 times sales. So while the price-to-earnings ratio is scary to some, the stock is not bloated given its growth trajectory.\n\nIn addition, technically AMD stock is still in the hands of the bulls. The weekly chart shows a clear ascending channel. And as long as the lower edges continue to hold, then the AMD bears will have a hard time taking control of the price action.\n\nShort term there are important levels to note. For the last few weeks, AMD stock price range is between $27.50 and $34 per share. The breach of either sides will carry momentum in that direction. Also, since the beginning of August, AMD has been setting higher-lows attacking a neckline at $32 per share. If the bulls can break above it then they could rally another $3 from there. And that would launch the opportunity of the next leg higher.\n\nIf the general equity markets cooperate, that would fuel the AMD buy programs to exceed $35 per share. But conversely, if the bears are able to bring AMD stock below $29 per share, then they may have the opportunity to trigger a $3 bearish pattern. So clearly the next few weeks are important to recommit to the direction of the next wave in Advanced Micro Devices stock price.\n\nThe Bottom Line for AMD\n\nOf all the chip stocks, AMD is the only one I would bet on these days. It has had the fewest fake-outs. Both stocks of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have disappointed investors several times in recent months. So I consider AMD stock as the best bet on the upside potential of all chip stocks if not the market as a whole.\n\nIf stocks are higher in the future, then AMD is definitely higher. To that, the bearish consensus is starting to build. The media is pushing the notion that we are in the late stages of the economic expansion. Meaning that a recession is coming. While that is eventually true, there is no evidence yet that a recession is imminent.", "description": "They say that markets tend to climb the wall of worries.
