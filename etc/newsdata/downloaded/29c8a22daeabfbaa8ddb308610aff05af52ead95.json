Three hospitals had closed over the course of an hour.\n\nThat is nearly 10% of hospitals, but in a system where diversion is common, it didn\u2019t raise an alarm.\n\n\u201cWe are in pretty good shape,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when they start closing, they start falling like dominoes.\u201d\n\nDepending on the hospital, ambulances carrying trauma, stroke and heart attack cases will still be allowed to come.\n\nIn addition, under the state guidelines, if it will take more than five minutes to get to the same kind of care, paramedics \u2014 if they get the approval of medical authorities at dispatch \u2014 can break the hospital\u2019s diversion.\n\n\u201cOur policy is if the medical benefits outweigh the risk, that is what is critical,\u201d said Stein-Spencer. \u201cIf a patient has a life-threatening injury or illness or has a compromised airway, they go to the closest (hospital) whether or not on bypass.\u201d\n\nThe department, however, declined to release data that would show if this is happening.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chicago Fire Department said it sometimes has to take immediate action on its own.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll start screaming and things come back up,\u201d said Larry Langford, spokesman for the department. \u201cWe make a few calls and magically it happens and they are able to open back up.\u201d\n\nA City of Chicago paramedic said if enough hospitals go on bypass, ambulance drivers can ignore the order but they have to be careful. Chicago\u2019s EMS procedures say such overrides should happen only \u201cunder unusual circumstances.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could potentially be disciplined by the EMS system and if the EMS system disciplines me, that may make me take leave from the city because I need that license to work,\u201d the paramedic told the Journal Sentinel. The paramedic spoke on the condition that his name not be used as he was not authorized by the department to speak.\n\nSheridan, the Chicago Fire Department official, said she believes hospitals close themselves to ambulances due to economics, as administrators try to match their limited staffing resources with the flow of patients.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that they are doing it deliberately as a way of doing business,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are just trying to stay in business.\u201d\n\nBut the data reveals a predictability to hospitals closing to ambulances. The Journal Sentinel analysis found the biggest day of bypass in the week is Tuesday, a time when many elective surgeries are scheduled and those patients are taking up in-patient beds.\n\nElective surgeries are coveted by hospitals because they mean more money. A 2008 study of 1 million Medicare cases found hospitals made $700 more on elective admissions than ER patients.\n\nWith so much at stake, patients who are in the back of an ambulance might not know they were turned away from a hospital, said Maglione, who represented the family in the death of Lenise.\n\n\u201cYou or a loved one could have gotten better care at another hospital. How do you know that? In the case I represented, it got out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are people out there who might not even know it and are not getting the level of care they needed or maybe even died because they didn\u2019t go to the right hospital.\u201d\n\nPatient advocates agree. Most sick patients have no idea their ride to the ER may involve bouncing from place to place and losing precious minutes, said Raquel Gabriel-Bennewitz, owner of Chicago Health Advocates, a business that helps patients navigate the system.\n\n\u201cThose are not moments to hesitate. That is atrocious,\u201d said Gabriel-Bennewitz, a nurse since 1974. \u201cYou really are gambling with someone\u2019s life, right? The punchline is that could be you, that could be me.\n\n\u201cThat could happen to any of us.\u201d\n\nAdvocate Christ on high bypass for years Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Illinois, is part of the Advocate Aurora Health chain, a major player in the Milwaukee health care market.\n\nAdvocate Aurora\u2019s hospitals in Milwaukee County stopped diversion after a voluntary countywide ban was brokered in 2016.\n\nThe hospitals went from nearly 4,800 hours on diversion for a six-month period in 2015 to 13 hours in the same period the following year.\n\nAdvocate Aurora, though, continues to allow its hospitals outside of Milwaukee County to go on diversion. And one of it's Illinois hospitals, Advocate Christ, has a long history of turning away ambulances, according to Illinois state data.\n\nSince March 2018, state regulators have been warning the hospital to cut its hours on bypass, but the practice continues.\n\nIn early September, the state sent a warning letter to Advocate Christ saying the hospital's hours on ambulance diversion remain high. The state visited the hospital in July and noted efforts to improve operations.\n\nDespite that, Advocate Christ\u2019s hours went up, not down.\n\n\u201cThe department expects to see a progressive improvement in the coming months, which may entail another IDPH visit or further action,\u201d the Sept. 3 letter said.\n\nHospital officials told the Journal Sentinel they are often overwhelmed with patients drawn to specialty centers in their facility, such as for cardiovascular care. They said their ER sees more than 100,000 patients a year. They call diversion their \u201clast resort.\u201d\n\nIn an April letter, Advocate Christ told state regulators the hospital had rescheduled 232 surgeries to ease overcrowding.\n\nAdvocate Christ on high bypass for years Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Illinois, is part of the Advocate Aurora Health chain, a major player in the Milwaukee health care market.\n\nAdvocate Aurora\u2019s hospitals in Milwaukee County stopped diversion after a voluntary countywide ban was brokered in 2016.\n\nThe hospitals went from nearly 4,800 hours on diversion for a six-month period in 2015 to 13 hours in the same period the following year.\n\nAdvocate Aurora, though, continues to allow its hospitals outside of Milwaukee County to go on diversion.

The hospital \u201chad a duty\u201d to care for the infant, the court held.\n\nThe ruling sent shockwaves through hospitals in Chicago and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe hospitals were scared because it was going to make a bunch of law that was unfavorable to them,\u201d Maglione said. \u201cThey were in a panic and you can\u2019t blame them. This was federal court so it meant the whole country.\u201d\n\nPressure mounted.\n\nHospitals and lobbying groups asked the entire 7th Circuit \u2014 all 14 judges \u2014 to take up the case. In a typical year, based on two decades of 7th Circuit records, fewer than five of the court's typical docket of more than 600 cases go to a full-court hearing.\n\nAccording to the court docket, eight groups backed the University of Chicago\u2019s request to have the court review the ruling, including Northwestern Hospital and the Illinois Hospital Association \u2014 even the state Department of Public Health. Documents filed by the groups in favor of reconsideration are no longer available.\n\nSix weeks later, records show, the three-judge panel went back, vacated its ruling and then reversed itself.\n\nThe judges offered no explanation for their change.\n\nIndeed, the official ruling acknowledged ambulance diversion could be used to discriminate against poor people: \u201cA hospital could conceivably use a (911) system in a scheme to dump patients (but) a persuasive argument to this effect is not before us in this case.\u201d\n\nWith the case sent back to the local court, the family ended up settling for $125,000.\n\nAfter paying the lawyers and other fees, Denise and Michael each received $23,000; her two sons got $10,000 apiece.\n\nCase fades from memory\n\nWhile the headlines about Lenise\u2019s death quickly faded, for Maglione the case became a passion during the years the litigation ground on.\n\nDenise landed in the hospital several times during that period, as the stress made her lupus worse. The relationship between Denise and Michael dissolved.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot on them,\u201d Maglione said. \u201cIt was tearing them apart as you can imagine. Being that young and having all this happen to you and losing a child in that manner.\u201d\n\nBesides the legal duties, Maglione was helping Denise find a place to live, buying the family food and cutting through red tape to get them public assistance. He also was trying to protect the family from those who thought there was money to be had. \u201cParasites,\u201d he called them.\n\nMaglione remembers that last time he saw Denise. His secretary told him Denise was there to see him.\n\nThat was unusual because traveling across town took a toll. When he saw her, she handed him a $10 bill. Maglione didn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018This is for you. Buy yourself lunch. You have helped me so much.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018I can\u2019t take this $10 from this poor girl who went through so much,\u2019 but she insisted. So that was her way of thanking me because she felt like she was so needy and she wanted to say, \u2018Let me do something for you.\u2019 I think that shows the kind of person she was.\u201d\n\nDenise Johnson\u2019s health declined in the years after her baby\u2019s death. She died in August 2001 at age 34, little more than a decade after she lost her child.\n\nLenise is buried at Washington Memorial Cemetery in Homewood, an hour south of Chicago\u2019s Loop.

The infant was in cardiac arrest five blocks from the University of Chicago's Wyler's Children's Hospital, but she was turned away and eventually died.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel unearthed details of the case through interviews with attorneys and examining media reports, medical examiner and state records and hundreds of pages of federal court files. Injustice Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news operation in Chicago, helped locate records and news articles on the case.\n\nIn order to understand how often hospitals in Illinois are diverting incoming ambulance traffic, the Journal Sentinel requested data from the state\u2019s Department of Public Health.\n\nHospitals in Illinois used a web-based system to alert in real time the department and other hospitals when hospitals go on bypass, another term used for the practice of effectively closing the emergency room doors to incoming ambulance traffic. The department only makes that data available to the public through an open records request.\n\nReporters requested data on each instance of bypass for every hospital in the state from June 2006 through September 2019. An analysis of that data showed some of the state\u2019s most prestigious hospitals are diverting ambulances for significant stretches of time.\n\nThe Illinois state law that directs the Department of Public Health to investigate hospitals when they go on bypass does not state what level of ambulance bypass is too much. Reporters asked the department what threshold it uses to determine which hospitals were diverting ambulances too often and a spokeswoman responded that it investigated when a hospital spent a \u201csignificant amount\u201d of time on bypass or when the bypass levels were \u201cout of the norm.\u201d\n\nReporters used the department\u2019s March 2018 warning letters, and the history of diversion at four hospitals, to determine the threshold regulators were using.\n\nThe letter to the University of Chicago Medical Center noted the hospital had been on bypass for 16% of the time, and it sought an explanation from the hospital\u2019s CEO as to why it was necessary to turn away incoming ambulance traffic so often. A similar letter to Advocate Christ Medical Center cited a 20% ambulance bypass rate. One to Franciscan Health-Olympia Fields said a 21% bypass rate was the reason for the letter, and the warning letter to Northwestern Memorial Hospital noted a 58% bypass rate.\n\nUsing the bypass data provided by the state, reporters were able to identify dozens of previous instances in which hospitals had passed thresholds cited in the 2018 letters without receiving any warning or fine from the Department of Public Health.", "description": "An infant's death in 1990 in Illinois sparked public outrage.
