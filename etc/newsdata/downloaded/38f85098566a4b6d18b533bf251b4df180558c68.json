YouTube\n\nVideo shows the truck driving across the nearly 500-foot-long bridge. The conditions appear to be postcard-worthy \u2014 sunlight, mountains in the background and calm turquoise waters below.\n\nThe truck nearly reaches the end of the bridge when, seemingly out of nowhere, the structure gives way. The bridge bows in the middle before collapsing into the water.\n\nIt's unclear what caused the arch bridge to fail. Taiwan News said officials are focusing the early stages of their investigation on the bridge's steel cables. But the Central News Agency said a bridge pier may have collapsed, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe AP also notes that while the weather at the time was fine, \"the collapse occurred hours after a typhoon swept by the island. Disaster relief officials would not say if the storm had weakened the bridge or give other details on the cause.\"\n\nSu'ao township chief Lee Ming-ch told reporters on Tuesday that five injured people were taken to hospitals and that at least six crew members were still trapped under the bridge.\n\nThe landmark bridge was completed in 1999, according to the website Focus Taiwan, which adds that it was \"the only single steel arch bridge in Taiwan and was the first bifurcated single arch bridge in Asia.\"", "description": "Video shows a truck driving across the bridge in Taiwan's Su'ao township, in the island's northeast.
