Though he said he liked some of Ms. Warren\u2019s policies and admired her for setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he described Mr. Sanders as the only candidate in the race who was truly \u201cbeholden to the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think to elect anyone else is a foolish venture,\u201d he said.\n\nHow Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren compete and contrast themselves with one another is one of the biggest questions of the autumn phase of the campaign. That mini-contest among the leading candidates will also reveal whether there is enough oxygen for any of the 17 other hopefuls to catch fire in the five months before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s summer has hardly been a smooth ride. Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris attacked his record on race. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand did so on gender issues, before dropping out last week. Mr. Buttigieg, who is 37 years old, has built his campaign on an unsubtle age contrast with Mr. Biden, who is 76.\n\nYet more than four months after he opened his campaign, Mr. Biden remains the leader. Few of the Democratic county leaders and party activists who populate Iowa\u2019s political class say they are thrilled with the former vice president, and many say there\u2019s little enthusiasm for his candidacy, yet he remains atop almost all polls of Democrats, in Iowa and elsewhere.\n\nStill, a belief that Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign will crater permeates the other presidential campaigns. Eventually, officials with rival campaigns say in private conversations, voters will find Mr. Biden an unsteady hand, his gaffes too risky in a contest with President Trump.", "description": "Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar were among those making strong calls for new measures to address the nation\u2019s recent spate of gun violence.", "authors": ["Reid J.
