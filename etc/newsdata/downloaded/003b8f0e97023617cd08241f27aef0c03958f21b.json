I always wanted kids. Even when I was a kid, I wanted kids.\n\nWe had our first miscarriage in 2003 and lost a second baby at 12 weeks in 2007. It was now 2011 and a doctor had just told me we were about to lose the twins my wife was carrying.\n\nI fully appreciate that it\u2019s harder for mums to lose their babies \u2013 what with them growing inside their bodies and all that entails \u2013 than it is for dads. But I suffered being childless.\n\nWe got there in the end. Fourth time lucky. I feel desperately sad for those whose dream never comes true. After losing I know the feeling and I feel blessed. I don\u2019t take anything for granted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy partner had her first miscarriage quite early in our marriage but it wasn\u2019t even clear what had happened because the foetus was so small and had to be confirmed as a pregnancy in a hospital visit.\n\nThe stupid thing on my part, which was quite inconsiderate to my partner, was that I was like: \u2018My boys can swim!\u2019\n\nNot that I actually said it but I thought then that it would inevitably happen for us, maybe just a few months later. I was wrong. So wrong.\n\nThere was a genetic problem which meant that any baby we had would have a 25 per cent chance of suffering a crippling blood disorder. But when my partner next got pregnant a few years later, we were full of optimism.\n\nWe had rebuilt a beautiful house, with a lovely garden, which was mostly my work. It was a wonderful place for kids to grow up in.\n\nAt that time, the \u201925 per cent diagnosis\u2019 could only be done once the pregnancy was three months in. We went along to have a sample taken and saw our child on the scan. My partner and me looked and smiled as we watched it moving in the womb.\n\nA three in four chance of a favourable outcome seemed like pretty good odds.\n\nA few weeks later, I got the phone call at home from the specialist while my partner was at work. It was the worst phone call I\u2019ve ever had. Bitterly, I said to the doctor: \u2018You\u2019re probably used to this.\u2019\n\nA few weeks later, our world fell apart, again (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nShe insisted it was always hard to deliver such devastating news. I didn\u2019t mean to lash out and be rude, I just didn\u2019t know what else to say. I recall that I told my partner on the phone while she was at work. Maybe that was a mistake but it\u2019s what we had decided to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe couldn\u2019t understand because the odds were stacked in our favour. But I explained that someone has to be in the 25 per cent. We had decided to have a termination if we had that diagnosis. The alternative was a short, painful and restrictive life for the child.\n\nOur child.\n\nI will always have that memory of the scan seared into my mind. A dark cloud always gathers above me when I think about it. More hurt was to come.\n\nMy cousin, who is eight years younger than me, came by a few months later with loads of fancy pastries in white boxes\u2026and the scans of his baby. Blood rushed to my head as he pulled them out while we were sitting in our idyllic garden on a blazing hot day.\n\nMy partner was plainly distressed, made her excuses and left. I\u2019m sure my cousin didn\u2019t set out to hurt us but he knew our story and he was that much younger than us, with all that entails when it comes to making babies. We should have had the opportunity to absorb his news in our own space.\n\nMy marriage was never ideal but losing that second child sort of haunted us. It\u2019s like we could see little ghosts in the garden on a summer\u2019s day. I\u2019d be playing silly games with them. Maybe we\u2019d have a paddling pool and my wife would be preparing our cold lunch outside. Potato salad and cheese sandwiches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo cut a long story short, things took their toll on me and I had a full-on nervous breakdown. I lost my sense of reality. I wondered whether the baby in the womb had been healthy but\u2026I don\u2019t know, paranoia. My life fell apart as my mental health deteriorated.\n\nIn the following years, we had to sell our dream home because I couldn\u2019t work. Eventually, we started to turn things around and got our lives back on track.\n\nThe great thing was that science had moved on. Cutting edge IVF procedures meant a one-cell sample from an embryo could determine which ones were in the \u201925 per cent\u2019. Two that weren\u2019t were implanted and they both took.\n\nI was truly happy for months on end and I think my partner was as well. We started letting people know after three months that we were expecting twins.\n\nBut a few weeks later, our world fell apart, again. One twin was on its way to a miscarriage and the doctors said the other would follow. I couldn\u2019t stop crying whenever I was on my own, especially coming back from the hospital where I was trying to keep it together in front of my partner.\n\nI felt I had so much to offer as a daddy but that it just wasn\u2019t meant to be. I always wanted at least two kids but I solemnly prayed to God: \u2018Just give us one.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first one did miscarry at 20 weeks and we were told by the doctors that the second one would as well. They offered to give my partner a pill to \u2018speed up the process\u2019. Fortunately, she resisted and my daughter was born at 27 weeks, weighing less than a bag of sugar.\n\nA week before the birth, we had met with a specialist who told us about all the problems that a premature baby might have. I was so scared. I thought: \u2019What if I don\u2019t love my child because it\u2019s blind or deaf or has some other disability?\u2019\n\nBut as soon as my daughter was born, it was love at first sight. I vowed to myself to protect her, to love her no matter what. To cherish the blessing of this young life. She spent two months in an incubator but the funny thing is that from the first time I set eyes on her, I was 100 per cent sure that she would make it. I felt it.\n\nThat was eight years ago and my little girl is fighting fit. I thought having a child would fix my relationship with my partner but sadly, it didn\u2019t and we split up when my daughter was three. All the pain and the heartbreak of being childless for so long and all the devastating blows took their toll. But also, children don\u2019t fix relationships.\n\nThe great thing is that I have a wonderful relationship with my daughter. I love her so much and I like her as a person. I\u2019m co-parenting. One thing I never thought I\u2019d say about my kid is that I have a lot of respect for her. She\u2019s got a lot of character and she\u2019s great company. We\u2019re so offhand with each other and I kinda like it that way, it\u2019s funny.\n\nMy closest friend has six kids but I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. I prayed for one and I got one. Thank you, God. The monumental struggles on the path to parenthood have made me appreciate what I have. My daughter has helped me to be a better, more responsible person.\n\nSo, despite everything, I do feel so lucky and regularly spare a thought for those who haven\u2019t been as lucky.\n\nBut the three we lost are part of who I am. I carry around that pain\u2026and always will.\n\nBABY LOSS AWARENESS WEEK Baby Loss Awareness Week is held annually from 9 to 15 October.
