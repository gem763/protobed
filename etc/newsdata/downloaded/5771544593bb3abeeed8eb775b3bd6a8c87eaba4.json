USA TODAY\n\nTrent Williams' holdout is over.\n\nThe seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle reported to the Washington Redskins on Tuesday, a person with knowledge of Williams' actions told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the move.\n\nNFL Network analyst and former Redskins defensive back DeAngelo Hall was first to report the news.\n\nWilliams, 31, had been holding out from the team since June amid frustrations with both the team's medical staff and his contract. The Redskins opted not to trade him before Tuesday's deadline.\n\nBy reporting to the Redskins, Williams is credited with a year toward free agent eligibility. He is signed through 2020, when he is scheduled to make $12.5 million in base salary.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when Williams would be ready to return to action after missing the entire offseason and first half of the regular season. The Redskins face the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.\n\nWith Williams out, the Redskins have sputtered to a 1-7 start. Washington fired coach Jay Gruden after an 0-5 start, and the offense ranks 30th in total yards (261.1 per game) and 31st in passing (176.4 yards per game).", "description": "Trent Williams' standoff with the Washington Redskins is over, as the seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle reported to the team Tuesday.", "authors": ["Mike Jones", "Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
