The Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act is designed to make \u201clarge communications platforms\u201d loosen their hold on user data. It builds on regulations that have already been implemented in Europe, and it speaks to serious concerns about online walled gardens.\n\nBut the ACCESS Act doesn\u2019t lay out precisely how these rules might change our relationship with companies like Twitter and Facebook. Some of its details are still up in the air. But based on what we know, here\u2019s why the bill matters and why it\u2019s not a surefire solution for opening up the internet.\n\nWhat does the bill say?\n\nAs my colleague Makena Kelly explains, the ACCESS Act applies to \u201clarge communications platforms\u201d with 100 million monthly users that generate income from collecting, processing, or sharing user data. That would cover Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and most other well-known social networks.\n\nThese platforms would have to offer interfaces that let users download their own data or transfer it to another service. Platforms would also need to let users authorize third-party apps that could access and interact with data as long as these \u201ccustodial third-party agents\u201d register with the Federal Trade Commission and meet basic ethics and security standards.\n\nPlatform owners can revoke a third party\u2019s access if it engages in fraud or malicious activity (among other offenses), and they can charge a fee if it exceeds a \u201creasonable threshold\u201d of access. But they can\u2019t abruptly lock down the interface without an explanation, and if they offer interoperability between their own services \u2014 the way Mark Zuckerberg has discussed connecting WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram messaging \u2014 then other companies should get access as well.\n\nWon\u2019t big platforms already let you export data?\n\nYes, but the systems are limited. Facebook and Twitter, for example, deliver a big folder full of posts, photos, and other account content. Google offers Takeout, a similar export system for its many services. All three companies (plus Microsoft) are working on a more full-featured system called the Data Transfer Project. But it\u2019s still in development.\n\nBut the ACCESS Act isn\u2019t just about exporting data. It\u2019s also about offering companies access to live social networks through application programming interfaces, or APIs. We\u2019ve seen companies weaponize API access to cut off competitors. Facebook did serious damage to Vine, for example, by revoking access to its friend-finding system. Interoperability standards like those in the ACCESS Act could undercut these strategies.\n\nHow could interoperability change social networking?\n\nThe ACCESS Act echoes Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which includes a section on \u201cdata portability.\u201d In the wake of the GDPR, several services have promised to help users share information on their own terms \u2014 like Digi.me, which securely aggregates sensitive personal information, including health records, or Hub of All Things, a \u201cmicroserver\u201d network for storing your digital footprint. A US law could cement the idea that information should be held by users, not individual apps.\n\nInteroperability, meanwhile, could reduce the pull of huge social networking sites in a way that simply downloading your data off one service doesn\u2019t. \u201cA one-time portability helps a user switch more easily,\u201d says Charlotte Slaiman, senior policy counsel at advocacy group Public Knowledge. \u201cBut if they can\u2019t communicate back with their friends and connections on the large network, I think there\u2019s still a real lock-in effect.\u201d\n\nInteroperability won\u2019t make sense for lots of existing networks. (Most people probably don\u2019t want to post their tweets on TikTok, for instance.) \u201cThe big theory would be that new entrants would come,\u201d says Slaiman. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard in today\u2019s environment for a company that would rely on this thing that doesn\u2019t exist yet to survive without it for a while. So I think that if we are able to have interoperability required, then innovators will know if you come up with a new startup that is based on this system, you will have the opportunity for success.\u201d\n\nIf a new company wanted to compete with Facebook, for example, it wouldn\u2019t have to build an independent user base. Instead, it could plug into the main Facebook community and offer a unique set of features or a better interface. Facebook could clone these features, but its massive network would provide less of a crushing advantage because smaller competitors could access the same network as well.\n\nEven if the main goal is growing new networks, some existing ones could benefit \u2014 like Mastodon, a Twitter-like platform based on small \u201cfederated\u201d servers. \u201cThe main challenge facing Mastodon and other decentralized social media platforms is the network effect, i.e. \u2018can I talk to my existing friends on this platform?\u2019\u201d says Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko. \u201cI often get asked if it\u2019s possible to have an app where you can follow Twitter users from a Mastodon account (which right now is of course not possible).\u201d If Twitter were legally required to interface with Mastodon, that wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nWhat\u2019s the catch?\n\nThe ACCESS Act sketches out this big goal, but it doesn\u2019t define what reasonable interoperability looks like. That\u2019s up to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which would have 180 days to publish technical standards for interoperability on different kinds of platforms. That includes models for messaging, sharing multimedia content, and the broad category of \u201csocial networking.\u201d\n\n\u201cNIST would set up the specific technical specifications of how interoperable the services need to be,\u201d explains Slaiman. A broad framework might require platforms to give up access to most data for free. A narrow one could let them charge for anything beyond basic access. Even if this bill passes, we won\u2019t know until later just how meaningful it is, and tech companies will probably push to get their favored definition enshrined in law.\n\nDigi.me founder Julian Ranger, a firm advocate of data portability, worries that drawing up detailed interoperability rules will make it less effective. \u201cThe intent behind the bill is great, but they over-specify,\u201d says Ranger. \u201cThe most important thing that the bill should do is mandate data portability with a well-formed API. Don\u2019t say anything else.\u201d Otherwise, he believes, policymakers will only slow down the bill\u2019s implementation while laying down rules that quickly become obsolete or that unduly limit companies.\n\nThird-party access always raises big privacy and security questions. The ACCESS Act mandates privacy safeguards, but bad actors will still try to take advantage of the system. Interoperability might also raise awkward questions about moderation. If a hate group tries to build its own Facebook offshoot, Facebook will probably face criticism for granting them access, even if it\u2019s following the letter of the law. So is interoperability worth the risks? That\u2019s what lawmakers will have to decide.", "description": "The ACCESS Act would mandate interoperability on social networks, potentially lessening the power of online network effects, but key details are still up in the air.", "authors": ["Adi Robertson", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KqmvMUzxiqwsVnmICaF0ofp0omA=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10587643/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
