So the $75 million-film\u2019s performance when it opens Tuesday in China will be vital to its worldwide success.\n\nThe film, written and directed by Jill Culton, is about a Shanghai teenager (Chloe Bennet) who discovers a lost yeti on the roof of her apartment building. She and a pair of friends traverse China to return the creature, whom they name \u201cEverest,\u201d home to the Himalayas. \u201cAbominable\u201d garnered positive reviews (80% on Rotten Tomatoes) and a warm reception from audiences (an A CinemaScore) eager for a family friendly option.\n\n\u201cAbominable\u201d marks the seventh No. 1 film this year for Universal, or eight if you count \u201cDownton Abbey,\u201d released by the studio\u2019s specialty label, Focus Features. \u201cDownton,\u201d last week\u2019s top film, slid to second with $14.5 million. The big-screen encore for the British series has already grossed $107.1 million worldwide.\n\nThat gives Universal the most No.1 movies of any studio this year, passing Disney. Though Disney still commands an overwhelming market share of about 34%, Universal has had a strong year with a varied slate (\u201cUs,\u201d \u201dHobbs & Shaw,\u201d \u201dYesterday\u201d). The studio accounts for all three of the year\u2019s No.1-debuting original releases: \u201cAbominable,\u201d \u201dUs\u201d and \u201cGood Boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be all superheroes all the time. That\u2019s not necessarily going to be everyone\u2019s cup of tea,\u201d said Jim Orr, distribution chief for Universal. \u201cWhen we have films like \u2018Abominable,\u2019 \u2018Yesterday,\u2019 \u2018Good Boys,\u2019 \u2018Us,\u2019 we\u2019re bringing a lot of different people into the theaters and that\u2019s good for everyone. That\u2019s good for the entire industry.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a good run for original films lately at the box office. The stripper drama \u201cHustlers,\u201d from STX Entertainment, continued to hold strong with $11.5 million in its third week, dropping just 32%. It\u2019s now made $80.6 million altogether. \u201cHustlers\u201d potentially got a boost by having its star - Jennifer Lopez - announced this week as next year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime act, along with Shakira.\n\nAnd one of the weekend\u2019s biggest successes was \u201cJudy,\u201d which opened with $3.1 million on 461 screens. The film, directed by Rupert Goold, is about the final act of Judy Garland\u2019s life, when the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d star was plagued by drug addiction, health woes and financial troubles. The film\u2019s main draw is Zellweger\u2019s lauded performance as Garland, which has made her the best-actress Oscar front-runner.\n\nRoadside Attractions rolled out \u201cJudy\u201d with a rare medium-sized platform release that the distributor has found success with before on films like 2012\u2019s \u201cMud\u201d and this summer\u2019s \u201cThe Peanut Butter Falcon.\u201d The latter is a Mark Twain-inspired adventure starring Zack Gottsagen, who has Down syndrome, and Shia LaBeouf. This weekend, it became the year\u2019s top indie platform release with $18.1 million over eight weeks, passing A24\u2019s \u201cThe Farewell.\u201d\n\nHoward Cohen, co-president and co-founder of Roadside, says the 16-year-old distributor has succeeded by seeking populist indies. (\u201cJudy,\u201d for which the audience was almost 80% over the age of 35, will expand nationwide further next week.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging time in film distribution for indies and everyone but Disney, maybe,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cWe like movies that can draw an audience, that are crowd-pleasers. In a challenging environment, you have to give people a really strong reason to leave their house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe movies have to be properly released and promoted,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think the audience is still there.\u201d\n\nThe two-and-half-month break from superheroes atop the box office is expected to end next weekend when Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cJoker\u201d hits theaters, along with Fox Searchlight\u2019s \u201cLucy in the Sky\u201d and Netflix\u2019s \u201cDolemite Is My Name.\u201d\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.
