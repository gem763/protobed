Reaslistically, some could see their retirement savings completely wiped out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSometimes financial abuse comes from spouses, but it can also occur with children and grandchildren. Often these situations go unreported, Kryger noted, because people do not want to report loved ones.\n\nWhen it comes to common scams, more money tends to be at risk when fraudsters are coming for the cash. However, seniors were largely unaware of some of the most popular ways criminals were trying to steal their money (like romance scams or pre-paid credit/debit card scams), the study showed.\n\nOne of the new scams Kryger has begun to see bubble up involves her clients receiving a call from someone who says a lien has been put on a property and will only be released for a certain sum of money.\n\nThese cases also go unreported. According to Kryger that\u2019s due to a combination of factors, including embarrassment, fear caused by the fraudster and not knowing the proper channels for reporting incidences.\n\nCompounding problems for older Americans is the fact that nearly half of them also manage their finances entirely by themselves, which has the potential to leave them more vulnerable to scams or financial abuse. Additionally, financial literacy can decline, along with overall cognitive ability due to the onset of certain diseases, which is why it is important to put protections in place.\n\nAmong the steps Kryger recommends seniors take to ramp up safeguards is implementing a system of checks and balances. That can mean having family members involved, having the power of attorney in place, along with a trusted contact or two.\n\nShe also said it helps to involve a financial adviser, who can pick up on potential red flags quickly.\n\n\u201cNot any one protection is enough to fully protect against financial exploitation and abuse,\u201d Kryger said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAccording to lawmakers, older Americans lose an estimated $2.9 billion each year to scams alone.", "description": "Elder financial exploitation and abuse is on the rise, potentially putting individuals\u2019 retirement savings at risk.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/05/0/0/Retirement-Feature.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
