In response, the Massachusetts senator said: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system.\u201d\n\nIn leaked transcripts of July internal meetings published by the Verge on Tuesday, Zuckerberg identifies \u201ca political movement where people are angry at the tech companies or are worried about concentration or worried about different issues and worried that they\u2019re not being handled well\u201d.\n\nHe adds: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that, even if there\u2019s anger \u2026 that you have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts senator made her promise in March, saying in a blogpost: \u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2013 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\u201d\n\nWarren has performed strongly in recent polls, in some cases passing former vice-president Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic primary field. Last week, it was reported that key Democratic donors on Wall Street and in big business object to her plans on regulation and taxation and are threatening to sit out the election or back Donald Trump instead.\n\nI\u2019m not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable Elizabeth Warren\n\nIf Warren is elected, Zuckerberg says, \u201cI would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government \u2026 it\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things.\n\n\u201cBut look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u201d\n\nIn tweets on Tuesday, Warren said she wanted to reform \u201ca corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to hold big tech companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon accountable.\u201d\n\nIn July, Facebook was fined $5bn by the Federal Trade Commission for privacy violations in connection with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was also fined $100m by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors on the risks involved in its use of personal data. Revenues soared regardless.\n\nIn the transcripts, Zuckerberg also discusses the Libra cryptocurrency, his refusal to testify before foreign governments, competing with TikTok and other problems facing Facebook.\n\nOn relations with the US government, he is asked if he is worried by the fine and \u201cthe rise of politicians like Senator Warren\u201d.\n\nZuckerberg says \u201cbreaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues\u201d.\n\nAddressing election interference and voter manipulation, the heart of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he adds: \u201cYou know, [breaking up big tech] doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any of the hate speech or issues like that less likely. It makes it more likely because now ... all the processes that we\u2019re putting in place and investing in, now we\u2019re more fragmented.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg draws laughter by saying Facebook\u2019s \u201cinvestment on safety\u201d is \u201cbigger than the whole revenue\u201d of Twitter.\n\nIn conclusion, he concedes there is a need for \u201ca regulatory framework where people feel like there\u2019s real accountability.\n\nBut he also says \u201cthe direction of the discussion\u201d is \u201cconcerning\u201d.\n\n\u201cI at least believe, I think, there are real issues,\u201d Zuckerberg says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the antitrust remedies are going to solve them.\n\n\u201cBut I understand that if we don\u2019t help address those issues and help put in place a regulatory framework where people feel like there\u2019s real accountability, and the government can govern our sector, then yeah, people are just going to keep on getting angrier and angrier.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Leaked recordings published by the Verge show Zuckerberg fears \u2018existential threat\u2019 if Democratic contender becomes presidentIn the recordings, Zuckerberg says: \u2018Look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\u2019 Photograph", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly In New York"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_Oh.qaAoeacHaC0COHqJ1Q--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/f7597a3c5c7e504dfeecf557417d1352"}
