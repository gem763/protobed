A new all-in-one medication may let you do just that.\n\nThe \"polypill,\" worked just as well to prevent and treat elevated blood pressure and high cholesterol, according to a new study.\n\nThe experimental pill could be a game changer for lower-income patients.\n\n\u201cWe have made a lot of progress in preventing and treating cardiovascular disease but that progress hasn\u2019t reached everybody,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Mu\u00f1oz, an assistant professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in an interview with ABC News. Munoz was involved in the study testing the pill conducted by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Franklin Primary Health Center.\n\nIf the benefits seen in this study continue, the researchers predict that the polypill would lead to a nearly 25% reduction in the number of new cardiovascular events in the lower-income population -- which is particularly at risk.\n\nCardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, especially in minorities and those with low socio-economic status. Two major contributors to cardiovascular disease are high blood pressure and high cholesterol. 75 million American adults have high blood pressure and nearly 29 million American adults have elevated cholesterol according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Dr. James De Lemos, a professor of medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern, said \u201cWe have evidence that these polypills create meaningful patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nHe described polypills as low-cost medications containing \u201clow dosages of medications that have very good side effect profiles and don\u2019t require lab monitoring.\u201d De Lemos was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study polypill was formulated to include four low-dose medications that are already standard treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The pill includes generic formulations of Lipitor, Norvasc, Cozaar and HydroDiuril. The combination pill -- four medicines in one -- was manufactured at the low cost of $26 per month, per person. What\u2019s more, patients would only have to take one pill instead of four, making it easier to stay on track with taking the medicine.\n\nPeople in the trial were treated with either the polypill or with traditional medications. After the trial was over, systolic blood pressure (the top number) decreased by nine points in the polypill group, whereas it only went down two points in the standard treatment group. LDL cholesterol level (\u201cbad cholesterol\u201d) decreased by 15 mg/dL in the polypill group, while the comparison group went down by just 4 mg/dL.\n\nOnly 1% of patients had side effects: muscle pain, light-headedness or low blood pressure.\n\nSTOCK PHOTO/Getty Images\n\nAnother recent study in Iran showed that a different polypill led to prevention of major cardiovascular events.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we need to better understand what works and doesn\u2019t work in these settings so that we can improve outcomes for our fellow citizens who may be the most vulnerable. ... In this era of precision medicine and individualized therapies and care, an approach like the polypill could be labeled as a one-size-fits-all approach,\" Mu\u00f1oz explained.\n\n\"We think that a population-based approach like the polypill can be used together with individualized therapy. It doesn\u2019t have to be either or,\u201d he added.\n\nThe pills aren\u2019t available yet. Further work is needed to get approval for polypills and for optimizing treatment for underserved Americans.\n\nDe Lemos imagines that both of the recent studies on polypills \u201cshould give momentum to develop these products and get them used.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be our hope,\" he added.\n\nTulsie N.
