The selections included high-profile founders such as Elon Musk, co-founder of Telsa, as well as Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick.\n\nA whopping 77% of people said they didn't know Dorsey, while 7% guessed incorrectly. This question yielded the most amount of \"unsure\" responses in the entire survey.\n\nWhen the data were further broken down, 23% of survey respondents who had a bachelor's degree or higher were able to clock Dorsey in the photo. Age was another factor that influenced their awareness: 20% of those ages 18 to 29 answered correctly, compared to only 7% of people ages 65 and up.\n\nThe photo in question was from Dorsey's April 2019 TED Talk. In it, he's wearing a black beanie, and has a long beard.\n\nDorsey was the only tech leader respondents were asked to identify. But those surveyed also lacked knowledge about other prominent social media platforms. Only 29% of Americans knew that messaging app WhatsApp and Instagram are owned by Facebook, for example.\n\nThe rest of the survey contained more general questions about internet use. For example, the survey asked people how \"private browsing\" works, what \"net neutrality\" means and what two-factor authentication looks like on a web page.\n\nYounger adults (defined as 18 to 29) answered more questions correctly than those in the 65-plus group, suggesting that they might be more internet literate.\n\nThese findings are part of a larger Pew Research Center survey called the American Trends Panel.\n\nDon't miss:", "description": "A new Pew Research Center survey looked at American adults' internet literacy.
