The year of the clip is 1967, and Makeba\u2019s song is Pata Pata: an international smash hit by a black female talent exiled from her own country under apartheid rule.\n\nMore like this:\n\n- The most shocking song ever?\n\n- A call to action around the globe\n\n- The making of an iconic song\n\nMakeba had released many songs before Pata Pata, but for global audiences it has endured as an instant gateway, both to the rich versatility of her sound, and an expansive world perspective. Makeba had previously recorded a version of the song, the sweetly swinging Phatha Phatha, with her Johannesburg girl group The Skylarks in 1959. Her musical abilities had been recognised during her Prospect Township childhood, and by her 20s she was singing and acting professionally, appearing in US filmmaker Lionel Rogosin\u2019s acclaimed anti-apartheid movie, Come Back, Africa (1959) among other things; her emergence as a prominent young activist voice led to South Africa\u2019s white supremacist government banning her from returning home in 1960.\n\nThe song was a burst of gloriously defiant revelry even in times of hardship and oppression\n\nIn the US, Makeba successfully collaborated with calypso star Harry Belafonte; they sang together at JFK\u2019s Madison Square Garden birthday party in 1962, and won a Grammy for their album, An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba (1965). The 1967 release of Pata Pata, however, proved an irrepressible mainstream breakthrough.\n\nThis version of the song, recorded with US R&B producer Jerry Ragovoy, featured a lighter, more directly poppy arrangement and a few additional English-language words (\u201cEvery Friday and Saturday night, it\u2019s Pata Pata time!\u201d exclaims Makeba), but it retained an unrestrained spark, with Xhosa-language lyrics about a flirtatious dance move (\u2018Pata\u2019 translates as \u2018light touch\u2019): a burst of gloriously defiant revelry even in times of hardship and oppression. Xhosa was also the native tongue of Makeba\u2019s late father, and a language often regarded as too complex for \u2018mainstream\u2019 audiences to pronounce; another Makeba song, Qongqothwane (1960, based on a traditional Xhosa song, popularly known as The Click Song).\n\nGoing viral\n\nPata Pata\u2019s roots run undeniably deep. In his essay, From Noma Kumnyama To Pata Pata (2009), music historian Rob Allingham describes the track as \u201cquite probably the best-known song of African origin in the world\u201d, and argues that it can be traced to even earlier sources, including a 1940s Zulu-language vocal group. Makeba herself would express ambivalent feelings about the track; in her 1987 autobiography My Story, she described Pata Pata as \u201cone of my most insignificant songs\u201d \u2013 certainly, her catalogue features a wealth of grittier sentiments, not least Sophiatown Is Gone (a 50s jazzy lament about the apartheid destruction of a vibrant township) or Soweto Blues (a 1977 song about the 1976 Soweto uprising, written by her former husband, multi-instrumentalist Hugh Masekela).\n\nYet Makeba was also struck by Pata Pata\u2019s pervasive impact, writing: \u201cAll of a sudden, people who never knew I have been in America since 1959 are asking me to be on their television shows and play at their concert halls in 1967. In the discotheques, they have invented a new dance called the Pata Pata. Couples dance apart, and they then reach out and touch each other. I go to Argentina for a concert, and everywhere I travel in South America, they are singing my song.\u201d\n\nPata Pata still captures a subversive joy, a sense of indefatigable human spirit \u2013 like all the greatest pop records, it is not throwaway, but revolutionary\n\nThe US, of course, was tussling with its own civil rights issues. Middle America may not have flinched when Makeba was testifying against South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime at the UN, but it blanched with hostility when she married Stokely Carmichael, a leader of the Black Panther Party, in 1968; Makeba suddenly found her US tour dates and TV appearances cancelled, and the couple moved to Guinea \u2013 she would later relocate to Belgium.\n\nIn her book Liberated Threads: Black Women, Style, and the Global Politics of Soul, Tanisha C Ford points out that Makeba\u2019s US success could not simply be cancelled; it \u201cgave many black Americans their first introduction to African culture\u201d, adding that her visual style also conveyed a significant message: \u201cBy the late 1960s, she had traded in her short-cropped natural for cornrows adorned with large wooden beads. Makeba and Carmichael\u2019s union signified the marriage of soul style and Black Power and evoked notions of revolutionary femininity and masculinity as well as of African diasporic unity.\u201d\n\nOver the 70s and 80s, Makeba might have become a stateless superstar, but her sound continued to champion South African culture as she performed across continents, her collaboration with Paul Simon on his 1987 Graceland project brought her back into the US spotlight (and elicited controversy, for breaking a cultural boycott of apartheid-era South Africa), and Pata Pata never lost its universal appeal. It still captures a subversive joy, a sense of indefatigable human spirit \u2013 like all the greatest pop records, it is not throwaway, but revolutionary.\n\nIn a 2000 interview with BOMB magazine, Makeba still expressed some incredulity at Pata Pata\u2019s massive success: \u201cI don\u2019t know why people like that song,\u201d Makeba laughed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t say anything\u2026 [But] Sometimes people are tired of thinking of difficult and unpleasant things.\u201d\n\nMakeba understood the power of music, and used that power \u2013 Rita Ray\n\nBroadcaster, cultural commentator and club DJ Rita Ray succinctly champions Pata Pata\u2019s significance in 2019: \u201cIt\u2019s a track I have known since childhood, when my parents played it at parties. it's been ever present [ever] since,\u201d Ray tells BBC Culture. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a pop song, yes it\u2019s about dancing and having fun, but crucially, Pata Pata transcends boundary and race. What is wrong with that \u2013 especially given that when Miriam recorded the hit version she was pretty much a lone voice speaking out against apartheid and crucially making the world aware of the inhumanity of it? She was young, beautiful and dangerously smart. She was witnessing apartheid in the US. Does she deliver her message by any means necessary, or via the hope of getting to the promised land? I think she understood the power of music, and used that power.\u201d\n\nPata Pata would be the last song that Makeba ever sang on stage; she suffered a fatal heart attack shortly after performing at a charity concert for anti-Camorra writer Roberto Saviano, on 9 November, 2008. She was 76 when she died, with Nelson Mandela (who had eventually persuaded Makeba, a long-time campaigner for his freedom, to return to post-apartheid South Africa) leading the tributes to an artist now revered as \u2018Mama Africa\u2019.\n\nIt is slightly surreal to consider the sheer range of cover versions that Pata Pata has inspired, from the Nuyorican big band blast of Tito Puente (1969) to a 1980 reworking of the tune by French yeye singer Sylvie Vartan and a recent version created for the soundtrack to a dancing videogame. A brilliant rendition still warrants a standing ovation \u2013 as Benin-born star Angelique Kidjo recently proved, when she closed her London Proms show with a vivacious homage to Pata Pata \u2013 but it always brings us back to the original. Makeba would write in her autobiography: \u201cI kept my culture. I kept the music of my roots. Through my music I became this voice and image of Africa and the people without even realising.\u201d Pata Pata may not have been her own favourite anthem, but it somehow embodies her grace and strength, and that of the culture she kept with her.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.\n\nAnd if you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter, called The Essential List.
