I really appreciated that.\n\nMyself and a few of the other Saints lads went for a couple of drinks afterwards and I was getting plenty of pats on the back - I was on a massive high.\n\nMy parents, John and Diane, were there that night and have supported me every step of the way.\n\nI am from Maghull in Liverpool, which is a huge football area and I'm a big Evertonian.", "description": "Great Britain is back after a 12-year absence and, while I am looking forward to facing Tonga this weekend, I cannot help but look back on my international debut.", "authors": ["James Graham", "Great Britain Captain", "Mick Cleary", "Alan Tyers"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/rugby-league/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000213451115-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq_4lZL6XGyKd1IzVfh-3zqtzqLCASpY_DdZ8Iryusf-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
