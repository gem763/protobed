During the 2016 campaign, Stone was in contact with WikiLeaks, which had obtained stolen Democratic emails from Russian hackers through an intermediary named Randy Credico. In 2017, Stone falsely testified to Congress that he had no records of his discussions with Credico. When he learned Credico planned to testify, he texted and emailed him on multiple occasions, once counseling him to \u201cstart practicing\u201d his Pentangeli. \u201cYou should do Pantagela [sic] on Erin Burnett,\u201d Stone wrote soon after.\n\nPentangeli was a capo of the Corleone family in The Godfather: Part II who planned to testify against Michael Corleone but was threatened into changing his mind and ultimately committed suicide rather than rat out the boss. Recently, prosecutors asked to show a clip of the film to jurors in Stone\u2019s trial for charges including witness tampering and making false statements to Congress. Stone\u2019s lawyers objected on the grounds that screening the scene \u201cwill instantly create a connection in the minds of the jurors that Stone is somehow similar to a murderous mafioso.\u201d Mercifully for Stone, the judge denied the motion, but will permit prosecutors to share a transcript of the scene.\n\nStone\u2019s case underlines a principle that\u2019s long been clear: It is impossible to understand the Trump administration\u2019s cast of characters, their lingo, and their governing ethos without a working knowledge of La Cosa Nostra and its Hollywood lore. If the Kennedy administration created Camelot, the Trump presidency has built a kind of cultural gangster state. The Francis Ford Coppola films are a classic piece of 1970s-vintage social criticism, presenting gangsters as stylized heroes and legal authorities as villains. \u201cMy father\u2019s no different than any other powerful man,\u201d Michael Corleone tells his future wife, Kay, \u201clike a senator or a president.\u201d When she calls him \u201cna\u00efve,\u201d saying, \u201cSenators and presidents don\u2019t have men killed,\u201d he devastatingly retorts, \u201cWho\u2019s being na\u00efve, Kay?\u201d The most satisfying scene in the sequel is one in which Michael is extorted by a corrupt politician and calls out his hypocrisy to his face.\n\nThe films\u2019 most fervent enthusiasts include gangsters themselves (though obviously the vast majority of fans, myself included, are not members of any crime syndicate). While their left-wing indictment of American society is presumably lost on rank-and-file mafiosi, who are not generally Chomsky- and Zinn-toting radical social critics, the films romanticized their ethos of clannish loyalty and contempt for the law. Mafia members adopted terms and methods from the movies. One of the realistic touches of The Sopranos was its depiction of 21st-century gangsters binge-watching and endlessly quoting The Godfather. Art imitating life imitating art.\n\nIf the Kennedy administration created Camelot, the Trump presidency has built a kind of cultural gangster state.\n\nIn his days as a builder \u2014 before he went bankrupt and transitioned into the branding business \u2014 Trump worked closely with mobsters, who controlled the city\u2019s concrete trade and influenced its building contracts. (\u201cI have met on occasion a few of those people,\u201d he told David Letterman in 2013. \u201cThey happen to be very nice people. You just don\u2019t want to owe them money.\u201d) Former FBI director James Comey said in a 2018 interview that Trump\u2019s style was eerily reminiscent of that of the kingpins he had prosecuted. \u201cI had a flashback to my days investigating the Mafia,\u201d he recalled of his early meetings with the president. Trump was trying to create a patronage relationship and demanding loyalty, Comey wrote, \u201clike Sammy the Bull\u2019s Cosa Nostra induction ceremony \u2014 with Trump in the role of the family boss, asking me if I have what it takes to be a \u2018made man.\u2019 \u201d Comey\u2019s successor at the FBI, Andrew McCabe, endorsed the comparison. \u201cThat kind of overwhelming or overriding focus on loyalty and sorting everybody out immediately \u2014 like, you\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re against us,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s methods, \u201cthose are all traits that you see in organized-crime enterprises.\u201d\n\nLike a crime boss, Trump has emphasized loyalty above all other qualities, and his management style reflects a justifiable fear of betrayal by his subordinates. (A source close to Trump warned in 2017 that Mueller was conducting a \u201cGambino-style roll-up\u201d of the administration.) He frequently speaks to them one-on-one, reducing the potential for hostile witnesses. The president went \u201cabsolutely bonkers\u201d when his lawyer John Eisenberg took notes during official meetings, a former White House official told Politico, because \u201chis sense was people were taking notes because they were going to write a book or testify against him.\u201d Trump likewise told White House counsel Don McGahn, \u201cWhy do you take notes? Lawyers don\u2019t take notes. I never had a lawyer who took notes.\u201d When McGahn replied that this is what lawyers do, Trump retorted, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.\u201d Which seems like a sensible precaution for the former counsel to such clients as Anthony \u201cFat Tony\u201d Salerno, Carmine \u201cthe Cigar\u201d Galante, and John Gotti.\n\nTrump has done surprisingly little to cleanse his history. During the primaries, Trump boasted about using donations to buy politicians. He has bragged about the number of his business associates who have been prosecuted on the basis of testimony by their underlings, not normally a point of pride. \u201cI know all about flipping \u2014 for 30, 40 years, I\u2019ve been watching flippers,\u201d he told Fox News. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it many times, I\u2019ve had many friends involved in this stuff; it\u2019s called flipping, and it almost ought to be illegal.\u201d He\u2019s even invoked The Godfather directly to disparage his enemies, like when he mocked CNN anchor Chris Cuomo by repeatedly calling him \u201cFredo.\u201d\n\nAs Michael Cohen, who once described himself optimistically as the Trump Organization\u2019s Tom Hagen (played by Robert Duvall in Coppola\u2019s films), put it, Trump encourages his cronies to lie by speaking in \u201ccode,\u201d like when he instructed Cohen that Trump had no business with Russia during the campaign, when both men knew otherwise. Trump grasped over the summer that his bureaucrats objected to trading diplomatic favors to Ukraine for an investigation of his rivals, so he coded his demand as an effort to root out \u201ccorruption\u201d even though he was in fact working in conjunction with the country\u2019s most corrupt figures and against its reformers. And Trump is surely the only president in American history to publicly attack the act of cooperating with law enforcement on principle. He has called John Dean, who testified truthfully against President Nixon, a \u201csleazebag\u201d and a \u201crat.\u201d When Trump railed against the FBI as \u201ccrooked, dirty cops,\u201d he channeled Michael Corleone\u2019s justification for murdering a policeman who had been bought by a rival family (\u201ca dishonest cop \u2014 a crooked cop who got mixed up in the rackets and got what was coming to him\u201d). Trump\u2019s subversion of bourgeois morality is a key pillar of his support. He can\u2019t be expected to tell the truth or follow the rules, because they all cheat, right? In the absence of virtue, all you can expect from your leader is loyalty, a man who will make your enemies his own.\n\nThe Trump era has inverted many familiar cultural tropes.Liberals have had the odd sensation of rooting for, and sometimes even lionizing, Mueller and his team of FBI agents. The Godfather has joined a long list of classic art that feels very different to watch now. In the 1970s, it was subversive to imagine a world in which Paulie Gatto, Sal Tessio, Frank Pentangeli, Carlo Rizzi, and poor Fredo all have to die for betraying the family; politicians and judges are bought and sold; and the goddamn FBI don\u2019t respect nothing. Surely Coppola never imagined that what was once a radical critique of power would one day become a justification for it.\n\n*This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
