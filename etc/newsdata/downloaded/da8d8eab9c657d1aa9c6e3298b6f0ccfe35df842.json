Because nothing says \u201cindependent feminist\u201d like needing to be flanked by two men, Milano was joined by Fred Guttenberg - father of Parkland shooting victim Jamie Guttenberg - and Ben Jackson - a so-called \u201cactivist.\u201d\n\nMany applauded the supposed \u201ccivility\u201d of the discussion, despite some repeated and unsubstantiated subtle attacks against both Ted Cruz and Americans who are concerned about gun control. While the meeting seemed fairly innocuous compared to the style of rhetoric we see elsewhere, two brief moments were missed which perfectly epitomized the Left\u2019s flawed attitude towards gun control. If we hope to make real progress in the fight against gun violence, then it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t ignore the real foundation of division when it comes to this debate.\n\nThe first moment took place when Ted Cruz expressed his shared desire to fight gun violence.\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cWe need to do more to stop this.\u201d\n\nFred Guttenberg: \u201cSo let\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s do it\u201d is representative of the common response from gun control advocates when their political opponents condemn acts of gun violence. While this may not have been Mr. Guttenberg\u2019s intention, the fact is that the Left cannot see the difference between agreeing with a problem and agreeing with their proposed solution. For them, if you agree that mass shootings are morally abhorrent, then you must therefore agree with their gun control proposals. Ted Cruz agreed with the problem, but until we agree on the \u201cit,\u201d we will not move forward together.\n\nThe second moment came during one of several ignorant and illogical interjections by Alyssa Milano. This was not her emotional appeal as someone with \u201canxiety,\u201d or her emotional appeal \u201cas a mother,\u201d or even her emotional appeal as someone who wanted to see for herself that Ted Cruz was human. It was her assertion that the scale of a problem justifies the experimental implementation of any policy, regardless of its efficacy or constitutional legitimacy.\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cI don\u2019t think [background checks] would have a meaningful impact in decreasing gun violence.\u201d\n\nAlyssa Milano: \u201cBut isn\u2019t it worth trying?\u201d\n\nThe same logic was echoed by Fred Guttenberg later in the discussion.\n\n\u201cBackground checks will certainly stop, I\u2019m not going to say the majority of those, but it\u2019ll stop some of them, and if we save lives it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\n\nAgain, whether intentionally or incidentally, this attitude uncovered both the hypocrisy of the Left, and the threat of increased power seized under the banner of \u201csaving lives.\u201d Firstly, if the only evidence required in support of any policy is that it\u2019ll \u201csave lives,\u201d then surely that would mean we should enact an instant immigration freeze. What about the forced euthanesia of anyone with a terminal, infectious disease? Why don\u2019t we outlaw vehicular travel? \u201cIf it saves lives, isn\u2019t it worth trying?\u201d\n\nWhile such flawed logic could arguably be motivated by good intentions, it would be na\u00efvet\u00e9 of the highest order to ignore the fact that such a shallow argument could not only be used to justify dreadful policies, but could also be abused by those who seek authoritarian power. The brutal fact is that all policies must be judged using far more complex and nuanced metrics than whether or not they will save certain lives, and should require substantive evidence of predicted efficacy before blindly handing over power to the state under the guise of \u201ctrying\u201d to solve a problem.\n\nThis meeting was undeniably a step in the right direction. Despite moments of subtle incivility towards Cruz, and an occasional lack of self-awareness from Milano, the discussion showed that we are still capable of talking with those with whom we vehemently disagree. However, unless we address the fundamental flaws in the gun control argument demonstrated by Alyssa Milano and Fred Guttenberg, the same logical roadblocks will remain in place, and we won\u2019t make any real progress in the battle against gun violence.", "description": "After actress Alyssa Milano \u201cdiscussed\u201d gun control policies during a .09/14/2019 1:24:22AM EST.", "authors": ["Ian Haworth", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/157/d43a86cf-0b16-4386-9bed-2555e6ac079d.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
