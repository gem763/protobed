After St. Louis loaded the bases in the ninth inning, Marcell Ozuna and Kolton Wong produced consecutive two-run doubles to first take the lead and then provide insurance runs that proved vital after Atlanta scored three ninth-inning runs.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIt was a stunning turnaround given how the game started for St. Louis. The first six innings were defined by moments in which they inflicted more damage on themselves than the Braves.\n\nKolten Wong\u2019s first-inning bobble on Josh Donaldson\u2019s would-be double play grounder directly resulted in Atlanta\u2019s first run. St. Louis had opportunities to bounce back in the third and fourth innings, but saw those rallies killed off by double plays.\n\nIn the sixth inning, it nearly fell apart for St. Louis completely. A two-run Braves rally started with Josh Donaldson being hit by a pitch by Cardinals reliever Tyler Webb, and ended up with third baseman Tommy Edman mishandling a two-out ground ball by Dansby Swanson that should have ended the inning, but instead resulted in two runs crossing the plate.\n\nThe Cardinals kept battling, tying the game in the eighth on Paul Goldschmidt\u2019s solo home run and a two-out run-scoring double by Matt Carpenter. That set the stage for their ninth-inning heroics.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was a disappointing performance for the Braves. They took advantage of the Cardinals shaky play early, but struggled putting together a rally that didn\u2019t include assistance from St. Louis. Atlanta scored three runs in the ninth inning on home runs by Ronald Acuna Jr. and Freddie Freeman. But by then it was too late.\n\nAtlanta starter Dallas Keuchel was on the ropes a few times in his 4 2/3 innings, but only allowed the one run. He did not record a strikeout. The Braves bullpen allowed six runs, all earned, in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves 7-6 in Game 1 of the NLDS. (Photo by Kevin C.

Goldschmidt smashed a solo home run in the eighth inning that proved to be the turning point for St. Louis. One inning later, he drew a one-out walk to set up Marcell Ozuna's go-ahead double.\n\n\u2022 Miles Mikolas: Given their shaky play, this one easily could have gotten away from St. Louis early. Mikolas is the main reason it didn't. He tossed five innings of one-run ball to keep the Cardinals in the game.\n\n\u2022 Josh Donaldson: The Braves third baseman was a key man on both sides of the field. He started rally-killing 5-3 double plays in the third and fourth innings, which allowed the Braves to carry a lead into the middle innings. He then started the go-ahead rally in the sixth inning after being hit by a pitch.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nMatt Carpenter's game-tying hit in the eighth inning could have been the game-winning hit if not for Adam Duvall's clutch throw from left field to cut down Kolten Wong at home plate.\n\nWHAT THEY'LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nRonald Acuna Jr's failure to run out a seventh-inning fly ball may have cost Atlanta an important scoring opportunity. Acuna was caught watching his deep drive to right field that looked like a potential home run off the bat, but ended up staying in the ballpark. As a result, a sure double turned into a single. Later in the inning, Acuna was doubled off second base on a line drive to end the inning.\n\nAcuna had been benched by manager Brian Snitker during a regular season for a similar lapse in judgement. The team had hoped it would be a teaching point for the 21-year-old outfielder. Teammate Freddie Freeman expressed disappointment that apparently the message had been missed following Game 1.\n\nFreeman on Acu\u00f1a not running out of box: \u201cIt is frustrating.... That can\u2019t happen in the postseason. It can\u2019t happen in the regular season.... Unfortunately tonight it did.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaid you have that conversation once, which they did, and after that it\u2019s beating a dead horse. \u2014 David O'Brien (@DOBrienATL) October 4, 2019\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nGame 2 is set for Friday at 4:37 p.m. ET and there\u2019s already plenty of urgency for the Braves with this being a best of five. Atlanta will try to even the series with Mike Foltynewicz (8-6, 4.54). The Cardinals will counter with ace Jack Flaherty (11-8, 2.75).\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Atlanta Braves 7-6 in Game 1 of the NLDS.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6rEQ3uALKoW7r_ycvxjSng--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OJny4EL9qkQ9wLa0aWAhEg--~B/aD0yNDg2O3c9MzcyOTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/63a8cb60-e641-11e9-9ff7-2fdcb4e42ead", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
