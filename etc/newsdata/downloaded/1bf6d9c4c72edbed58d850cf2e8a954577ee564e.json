It looks like it has closed the gap (on Ford),\" he said.\n\n\"We won't know until we get to Bathurst but I think the pace of the race and qualifying is going to be quicker. I expect lap records.\"", "description": "Holden drivers are confident aerodynamic changes to their Commodores have closed the gap on Ford's runaway Mustangs ahead of this weekend's Supercars...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
