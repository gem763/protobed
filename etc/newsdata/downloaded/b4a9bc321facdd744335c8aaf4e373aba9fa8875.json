He claims the suspected cop killer was not a terrorist and labels the media as disseminating \u201cmisinformation\u201d, Le Parisien reports.\n\nHarpon, an IT professional working at the police headquarters in Paris, killed four people including a female supervisor who he stabbed to death with a ceramic knife. The 45-year-old was later shot and died of his wounds.\n\nReports: Paris Police Killer an Islamic Convert Enraged by Reprimand for Refusing to Deal with Women https://t.co/RykPBOSX9o \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 3, 2019\n\nFollowing his arrest, Traor\u00e9 has been accused of \u201cthreats, an act of intimidation on a person exercising a public service or of collective utility, the threat of crime against people, and contempt\u201d.\n\nOn Thursday morning, prosecutors added another charge to the list, stating that the activist was also looking at one count of \u201capology for terrorism\u201d. Traor\u00e9\u2019s home was also raided by police, with several electronic devices seized for further analysis.\n\nTraor\u00e9 had originally put out the call for a demonstration to pay tribute to the suspected terrorist on social media. He suffered a wave of backlash from both the public and several elected officials who called for the event to be banned, despite Traor\u00e9 claiming the event was to pay tribute to the four victims of Harpon.\n\nA self-described anti-police violence activist, Traor\u00e9 had previously been involved with Theo Luhaka, a man who had claimed to have been a victim of police brutality, although later evidence put serious doubts on his claims.\n\nDuring a pro-Theo demonstration last year, Traor\u00e9 was convicted and fined 1,000 euros for insulting the then Minister of the Interior, G\u00e9rard Collomb, and several police union leaders after stating: \u201cIn our neighbourhoods, there are police officers who kill us, who rape us, who beat us.
