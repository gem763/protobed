Photo: Christopher Gregory/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump has said at least four times this year that he may consider staying in the Oval Office beyond his constitutionally allotted two terms, whether it\u2019s because his supporters won\u2019t accept an electoral college loss, or because the United States will be enticed by the idea of his presidency-for-life and want to \u201cgive that a shot.\u201d\n\nPerhaps to get ahead of that unprecedented crisis, and certainly to further endear himself to a man addicted to praise, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale showered the president\u2019s family with some high admiration this weekend. At a convention of Republican Party delegates outside of Palm Springs, California, Parscale predicted that \u201cthe Trumps will be a dynasty that lasts for decades,\u201d adding that the whole family has \u201camazing capabilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you see that from Don Jr,\u201d added Parscale, \u201cI think you see that from Ivanka. You see it from Jared. You see it from all.\u201d One can\u2019t help but wonder what Eric Trump \u2014 who recently learned how journalism works \u2014 might think of not making the cut.\n\nOnce you get past the pre-vomit obsequiousness of the comment, Parscale\u2019s forecast does carry some weight. Trump has said that his eldest daughter would be \u201cvery, very hard to beat\u201d if she ran for the presidency, and according to the New York Times, she is \u201cseen by West Wing aides and people who have worked with the family as harboring ambitions of her own for elected office.\u201d Donald Trump Jr. is leaning in heavily to the 2020 campaign, and as the Times gently puts it, he is \u201cmost naturally fluent in the language of the Republican base\u201d despite his time in elite prep schools, spending his childhood summers in Europe, and posing in forlorn repose on one of his father\u2019s many estates. Then there\u2019s Jared Kushner, already in charge of solving the opioid crisis, peace in the Middle East, and other \u201cinnovations.\u201d If Parscale is worried about the longevity it takes to achieve a true dynasty, there\u2019s always Barron, if the 13-year-old becomes so inclined in 22 years or so.\n\nTwo questions remain: What kind of dynasty will the Trumps be? Though Trump, in calling Melania \u201cour own Jackie O.,\u201d may think of his family as a cross-aisle mirror of the Kennedys, the Bushes might be more in line, considering the incompetence of the families\u2019 adult sons. (Add a heavy pour of the French Le Pen dynasty\u2019s xenophobia, and you might have a ringer for the Trumps.) The next question might be a little more practical: When will Trump abide to the next generation? It\u2019s hard to imagine Donald Trump, post-presidency, ceding time to his successor, whether it\u2019s Jared, Ivanka, Junior, or Eric \u2014 in that relative order of his politically involved kin.", "description": "Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, knows when to bend the knee: all the time, and with great vigor.
