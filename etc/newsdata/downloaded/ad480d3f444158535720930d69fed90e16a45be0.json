Pro-democracy activists and politicians say the concession on the extradition bill was too little, too late.\n\nIn addition to formally scrapping the legislation, the demand list includes establishing an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and allowing direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders.\n\nFor three months, protests have roiled semiautonomous Hong Kong, at times paralyzing the Chinese entrep\u00f4t and turning the streets into a battleground between demonstrators and police.\n\nThe 14th consecutive weekend of protests kicked off Friday afternoon with a call to gather at the Prince Edward subway station\u2014the scene of violent clashes last weekend. Video footage from last Saturday showed police storming into train carriages and indiscriminately beating passengers, some whom were cowering on the ground crying.\n\nBy late afternoon Friday, dozens of people had already turned up at the Prince Edward station, aiming to pressure subway authorities into releasing surveillance footage from the incident. The station announced it had called the police to clear the area.\n\nPrince Edward MTR continues to pile on people. One interesting difference, there are not many young kids around. The older folks told them to leave in case the police comes, so they'll take on the fight.

In mid-August, rallies inside the terminals shut down the busy regional hub, forcing hundreds of flights to be cancelled or delayed. Ahead of the planned disruptions, the city\u2019s Airport Authority placed ads in several local newspapers pleading with protesters not to block travelers from getting to the airport.\n\n\u201cSpare our passengers further disruption,\u201d the ad says. \u201cWe again strongly urge protesters not to disrupt the journey of tens of thousands of travellers who use our airport every day.\u201d\n\nRead More: Hong Kong People Know That They Are Better Than Their Current Politics\n\nOn Sunday, protesters will descend on the U.S. Consulate to urge Congress to pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The bill would allow the U.S. to revoke Hong Kong\u2019s status as a separate economic and trade zone to mainland China if Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy is found to be insufficient.\n\nThe protests, which have at times turned violent, have snowballed into a broader fight for greater democracy in Hong Kong, whose 7.2 million inhabitants are linguistically and culturally distinct from mainland Chinese. Many residents fear Beijing is eroding the \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d promised when the former British colony was retroceded to China in 1997.\n\nBeijing has denounced the protesters and state media has warned it could intervene. This week, Chinese President Xi Jinping singled out Hong Kong, the neighboring territory of Macau, and the self-governing island of Taiwan (which China considers a renegade province) as major risks the Communist Party must \u201cstruggle against.\u201d", "description": "Protesters say that the extradition bill's withdrawal was too little, too late", "authors": ["Amy Gunia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QdifF2qvP0HQu9vcY7Ts0Q--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/f7b34f93108ecfe3d9dbaa6a1d056720", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
