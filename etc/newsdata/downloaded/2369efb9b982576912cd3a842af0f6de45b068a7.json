It alleges that despite \u201crepeated demands that Ms. Daniels fulfill her contractual obligations and pay for the millions in legal fees and costs she has enjoyed for her benefit over the last approximate 19 months, including in this case, she has refused.\u201d\n\nAvenatti, 48, claims the porn star refuses to pay up because she is a \u201ccelebrity,\u201d and is therefore \u201centitled to free legal services and costs\u201d and to \u201cmanufacture and fabricate facts designed to impugn the reputation of her counsel and falsely accuse him of a multitude of acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the law does not work that way Ms. Daniels wishes,\u201d reads the suit, filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of Ohio.\n\n\u201cI look forward to the facts and the truth about what really happened coming to light,\" Avenatti told The Daily Beast when reached for comment. His lawyer, Tom Warren, added: \u201cMr. Avenatti did an enormous amount of high quality legal work for Ms. Daniels under intense pressure and scrutiny. He made significant personal sacrifices for her benefit. He deserves to be paid by her, not criticized.\u201d\n\nDaniels and her lawyer did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe porn actress and Avenatti became household names in January 2018 after filing a lawsuit to nullify a \u201chush agreement\u201d Daniels made with then-candidate Trump and his former fixer Michael Cohen just before the election.\n\nSince then, the two had a very public falling out back in May, and Avenatti has been hounded by legal troubles and currently faces federal charges in two states. In California, prosecutors alleged he stole $300,000 from Daniels and spent it on flights, hotels, restaurant deliveries, and to bankroll his law firm. And a New York grand jury indicted him in March for allegedly trying to extort Nike for $25 million.\n\nAvenatti\u2019s lawsuit this week alleges the initial February 2018 retainer agreement he made with Daniels was for \u201c$100 up-front payment,\u201d prompting his firm to spend \u201cthousands of attorney and staff hours, and a significant out-of-pocket-expenses.\u201d During his retention, Avenatti said he bailed Daniels out of jail \u201cfollowing her arrest in Columbus Ohio in July 2018\u201d after a strip-club brawl and led the \u201csuccessful efforts\u201d to have the charges dropped.\n\n\u201cDespite the significance of his work, Ms. Daniels has yet to directly pay a single dollar to Mr. Avenatti or Avenatti & Associates, APC for their legal services beyond the $100.00 she initially paid back in 2018,\u201d the suit states. \u201cMs. Daniels is required to pay her lawyers.\u201d\n\nAvenatti has previously told The Daily Beast that \u201cany and all other monies raised via a legal fund would go toward my legal fees and costs.\u201d\n\nDaniels and Avenatti alleged in her lawsuit, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, that Cohen paid her $130,000 during the 2016 campaign to stay quiet about an affair she had with then-reality TV star Trump a decade before he ran for office (the president admits to the payoff but denies the sexual tryst).\n\nThe payoff allegations ultimately led to a federal investigation charging Cohen with eight campaign-finance violations. He pleaded guilty in August, admitting he made illegal payments at Trump\u2019s direction, and was sentenced to three years behind bars.\n\nBut, in May, a little over a year after that lawsuit was filed, Daniels and Avenatti announced their split in a pair of tweets.\n\n\u201cI have retained Clark Brewster as my personal lawyer and have asked him and his firm to review all legal matters involving me,\u201d Daniels wrote. \u201cUpon completion of Mr. Brewster's review and further consultation with me, I anticipate Mr. Brewster will serve as my primary counsel on all legal issues.\u201d Less than 15 minutes later, Avenatti responded with his own statement claiming he terminated his relationship with Daniels in February but would not disclose the reasons due to \u201cattorney-client privilege.\u201d\n\nIn his new lawsuit, Avenatti says he decided to cut ties after \u201cDaniels became increasingly difficult, uncooperative, erratic, and unpredictable, and began falsely accusing people closely aligned with her (but not Mr. Avenatti) of theft without any legitimate basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cMs. Daniels\u2019 false accusations in some instances were targeted at friends of 20 years and her private security detail,\u201d the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe letter states the firm also decided to sever ties after \u201cprior false accusations (which you chose to make public before communicating them to me\u2014I found out from a reporter)\u201d and Daniels\u2019 \u201cgeneral lack of appreciation for our work and the thousands of hours we have devoted to you, which we have largely done for free at great expense to me and my firm.\u201d\n\nAvenatti concluded in the letter that the firm did not intend to make \u201cany public announcement relation to our decision to no longer represent\u201d Daniels and thanked her for the opportunity to serve as her counsel.\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the correct date of the lawsuit\u2019s filing.", "description": "In a September lawsuit, Avenatti alleges his former famous client believes she is \u201centitled to free legal services\u201d because she is a celebrity.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez", "Betsy Swan", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570128054/191003-melendez-stormy-daniels-vs-michael-avenatti-hero-ptk_lnrm1q"}
