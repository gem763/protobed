The reaction from his ex-colleagues, who are still facing the prospect of mass job cuts and a corporate crisis: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d\n\nThat was one of the comments posted on WeWork\u2019s staff-wide communications system Tuesday, reflecting a broader mood throughout its headquarters in New York. Dozens of employees expressed indignation in interviews and messages to colleagues on company Slack channels that were relayed to Bloomberg. They requested anonymity in a bid to protect their jobs, as management weighs the dismissal of thousands of employees.\n\nWeWork\u2019s board agreed Tuesday to take a bailout from SoftBank Group Corp., which will secure an 80% stake. The Japanese conglomerate will provide $6.5 billion to the business as it\u2019s on the verge of running out of money. SoftBank will also buy as much as $3 billion in stock from shareholders at the lowest price since 2015. Almost a third of that offer may be allocated to Neumann, in addition to a consulting fee of about $185 million, a $500 million credit line and the ability to appoint two board members. In exchange, Neumann will step down from his role as chairman.\n\nMost employees who sell their shares to SoftBank will do so for less than the paper value of their stakes when they were issued. Mike Adams, who sold a startup to WeWork, described the payout to Neumann as an \u201cinjustice.\u201d Representatives for Neumann and WeWork declined to comment. A spokeswoman for SoftBank didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNeumann, 40, built WeWork into a global real estate company fueled by relentless optimism and billions of dollars in investment capital and debt. His sermons about community and mission engendered fierce loyalty among staff and investors for years. But his aura vanished over the last couple months when public investors were given a closer look at the business ahead of an initial public offering. WeWork\u2019s parent company, We Co., abandoned the IPO, and SoftBank helped oust Neumann as chief executive officer.\n\nIn recent weeks, an executive exodus and cost-saving measures had already dampened morale. Especially in satellite offices, many workers had stopped coming into work. News of Neumann\u2019s \u201cplatinum parachute,\u201d as one former employee described it, made things a lot worse this week.\n\nA link to a news article about the deal on WeWork\u2019s Slack network Tuesday drew more than 100 \u201cthumbs down\u201d emoji from employees. Several workers noted the irony that WeWork could not afford payroll costs associated with the planned job cuts but that its largest shareholder, Masayoshi Son\u2019s SoftBank, agreed to pay a hefty fee to Neumann. One post read: \u201cSo we\u2019re too broke to pay employees severance, but Adam gets $200m?\u201d\n\nAnother employee posted a photo of the orphan from \u201cOliver Twist\u201d with the caption: \u201cPlease, Masayoshi Son, can I have some severance?\u201d\n\nNeumann was the main subject of ire from staff, but some complaints were also pointed at the pair of men who replaced him as CEO last month: \u201cSeriously, where\u2019s the email from our co-CEOs or whoever\u2019s running the company now?\u201d\n\n(Updates with announcement in the third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Ellen Huet in San Francisco at ehuet4@bloomberg.net;Gillian Tan in New York at gtan129@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Mark Milian at mmilian@bloomberg.net, Anne VanderMey\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- WeWork will narrowly avoid financial ruin and in the process, reward its former leader, Adam Neumann, with as much as $1.2 billion.
