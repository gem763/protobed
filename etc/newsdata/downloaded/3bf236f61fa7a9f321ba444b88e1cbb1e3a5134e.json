The watch earned its nickname after featuring in a Japanese TV superhero series The Return of the Ultraman in 1971.\n\nMr Cooper said: \u2018I was in Hong Kong and became friendly with a guy who knew a wholesaler who I could get a good price on a nice watch from for my 21st birthday.\n\n\u2018I spent \u00a335 on it, which considering my weekly wage was \u00a310, was quite a lot, but I\u2019m very glad I held on to it for all these years now.\n\nRoger Cooper spent almost a month\u2019s wage on the watch (Picture: AntiquesRoadshow/BBC)\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018I wore it while sailing dinghys until about 1983 so it did get bashed about a bit. I decided then to switch it for a cheap Casio and tuck the Speedmaster away safely in a drawer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would sometimes glance through the windows of watch shops to look at Speedmasters and over time I realised the ones on sale were slightly different to mine.\n\n\u2018Last year, I finally did a bit of research and found out its red hand is very rare, which prompted me to write in to Antiques Roadshow about it.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t expect to hear anything back but they were interested and we filmed the piece. I was stunned to find out how valuable it was.\n\n\u2018I could have kept hold of it as a heirloom but it is so expensive to insure I decided to sell it so I can treat my family.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s believed only 50 \u2018Ultraman\u2019 watches were made in 1968 (Picture: AntiquesRoadshow/BBC)\n\nMr Cooper, from Havant, Hampshire, sold it for \u00a331,000 with auction house Gardiner Houlgate.\n\nAuctioneer David Hare said: \u2018The Ultraman is an extremely rare version of the more common Speedmaster made famous by Neil Armstrong wearing one on the Moon.\n\n\u2018The only difference is that it has a very rare red/orange second hand and was made in limited numbers only in 1968.\n\n\u2018The Ultraman featured in a Japanese TV series a few years later, which is how it has come to be known by this name.\n\n\u2018These watches are extremely scarce and I only know of a couple of examples which have been sold at auction in recent years.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
