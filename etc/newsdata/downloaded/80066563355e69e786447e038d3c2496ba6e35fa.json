A flat fee is offered for crypto-to-crypto conversions \u2014 a rate that Changelly claims is one of the lowest on the market today.\n\nThe company says that this fixed rate is achieved by integrating a small reserve inside the exchange rate when the final figures are presented to the user. As a result, consumers can be confident that the funds they are projected to receive will be accurate upon delivery. Given the unpredictability that can surround crypto \u2014 with recent headlines showing that Bitcoin prices crashed by $1,500 within 24 hours \u2014 Changelly hopes this certainty will instill confidence in the crypto market for all.\n\nCompact and functional\n\nThe Changelly mobile apps have been designed to offer an experience not too dissimilar from its web platform. Users can log in using their regular account, exchange or purchase cryptos with ease, choose from eight languages, delve deeper into an array of coins and see the real-time rates for each of them. A full and comprehensive History section outlines past transactions, and a Support section means users can seek help from trained customer service professionals whenever they have questions. Frequently used crypto addresses can also be saved to make regular transfers simpler than ever before.\n\nChangelly\u2019s app is available here\n\nThe best rates possible\n\nChangelly says it uses a sophisticated trading algorithm that scours exchanges to find the best rates when users want to swap one cryptocurrency for another. This technology has also been integrated into large and reputable trading platforms.\n\nOne example given the company concerns someone who wants to convert XRP into Dogecoin. On a conventional platform that doesn\u2019t have a trading pair between the two cryptocurrencies, two conversions would have to be made \u2014 initially from XRP to Bitcoin, and then from Bitcoin to Dogecoin. As well as delaying the transfer, this also doubles the fees associated with completing the transaction. Changelly\u2019s unique selling point is ensuring that this conversion can take place immediately, meaning that only one low commission is charged. Given how there are thousands of cryptocurrencies on the marketplace today, the company is vying to offer crypto enthusiasts the freedom that most exchanges struggle to provide.\n\nEducating the public\n\nChangelly says that one of the main hurdles to cryptocurrency adoption is ensuring that the public is fully educated about its potential \u2014 not to mention the basic principles underlying blockchain technology and the latest trends. To this end, the platform has developed a crash course enabling newbies to learn more about crypto.\n\nAs well as delivering a full explanation of the types of crypto assets out there, it sets out the difference between hot and cold wallets, as well as a clear explanation of the different payment methods that can be used to buy crypto. A breakdown of the difference between decentralized and centralized exchanges is also provided, along with details of common scams and the risks associated with trading.\n\nChangelly says its crash course is well suited to those who are exploring crypto for the first time, as well as more experienced users who wish to expand their knowledge and strengthen their skills.\n\nLearn more about Changelly", "description": "A cryptocurrency swap platform has unveiled new apps for Android and iOS, delivering a flat fee for crypto-to-crypto conversions", "authors": ["Connor Blenkinsop"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjk3NTdlMTVmYzE4ZTAyZjVhY2IyODg0NDU0ZDViNTAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
