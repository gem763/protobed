But how do you do social engineering the right way \u2014 to make life better for everyone, not just to manipulate people into doing what you want?\n\nSocial engineering has developed a bad reputation thanks to pickup artists, pushy salespeople, and online scammers, but there\u2019s an under-appreciated technique that can help you both establish a connection and let you know when it\u2019s time to stop trying: mirroring.\n\nIf you know anything about the science of getting people to like you, you\u2019re probably familiar with mirroring. It\u2019s when we start matching our gaze, gestures, body positioning and speech patterns to the people around us. Many of us mirror without even thinking about it (which is why you often see people begin to match accents with the people around them, for example). However, there are also ways to mirror deliberately \u2014 a common social engineering trick people use to quickly establish a relationship or build trust.\n\nSo, ok. You\u2019re standing next to someone and you want to engineer some kind of social outcome from this interaction, whether you\u2019re hoping to make a new friend, forge a professional bond, or engender a romantic interest.\n\nYou start mirroring. Maybe you tilt your head to match theirs or shift your body weight in the same direction. Maybe you echo one of their gestures. If you\u2019re feeling extra-social-engineery, you\u2019ll probably throw in another common tactic like \u201cusing the person\u2019s name in the conversation\u201d or \u201casking for a small favour.\u201d\n\nAnd then you watch, carefully, to see how the other person responds.\n\nIf they\u2019re into you (socially, professionally, or romantically), they\u2019ll start mirroring your body language and speech patterns. If they\u2019re not, they\u2019ll either consciously or unconsciously break the mirror.\n\nYou can wait for your conversation partner to break the mirror organically (in many cases, they\u2019ll simply turn their body away from yours) or you can insert a pattern or positioning into your conversation and see if they either mirror or break.\n\nIf you\u2019re face to face with someone and you shift your gaze towards a different part of the room, for example \u2014 do they follow, or do they use that as an excuse to check their phone or sip their cocktail or stare patiently in the opposite direction?\n\nSo if you say potato and they say potahto (as the song goes) or if you start upward-inflecting your sentences and they start downward-inflecting, the best thing you can do, social-engineering-wise, is call the whole thing off.\n\nDon\u2019t try to re-mirror the broken mirror. Don\u2019t use their names seventeen more times. Do not, under any circumstances, go in for the arm brush or the shoulder pat or any of the other \u201cescalating kino\u201d tricks you might have read about.\n\nInstead, end the interaction while they still think well of you.\n\nBecause that\u2019s your ultimate goal, right? To be thought well of by most of the people, most of the time. You can\u2019t social-engineer everyone into being your best friends or business contacts, but you can use basic social engineering to make more people comfortable around you \u2014 by showing interest in what they have to say, building points of connection through mirroring or asking for favours, and then gracefully ending the interaction if they don\u2019t share your desire to connect.\n\nRemember, even the skeeviest pickup-artist literature advises you to do the initial social engineering stuff and then wait for the other person to come to you. Since the term \u201csocial engineering\u201d has now expanded to include stuff like phishing scams, I might as well remind you that they operate under the same principle. (The scammer initiates, and waits for the mark to respond.)\n\nSo if you\u2019re going to use social engineering for good, pay attention to how the people you interact with respond to everyday social engineering tactics. Building rapport over a shared goal is a great way to bond with someone, for example \u2014 but it can also be turned into a manipulative tool called \u201cforced teaming.\u201d\n\nHow do you keep yourself on the right side of the line? Don\u2019t force it. Let people choose whether or not they want to be on your team, and you\u2019ll start making connections with people who want to spend time with you without alienating the people who don\u2019t.\n\nIf you have other suggestions for how to use social engineering for good, let us know! Full disclosure: I just used a little bit of teaming myself, to imply that we all shared the same goal and wanted to discuss it together. I hope it works \u2014 but if it doesn\u2019t, I won\u2019t try to manipulate you into responding.", "description": "If you want to win friends and influence people, well, there\u2019s a whole book on how to do that.
