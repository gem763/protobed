Byron York makes Adam Schiff look even WORSE for kicking GOP lawmaker out of impeachment hearing", "language": "en", "text": "Apparently, Adam Schiffty Schiff kicked GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz out of the super-secret impeachment hearing earlier today.\n\nBecause you know, THAT\u2019S not suspicious or anything.\n\nByron York shared the news and his thoughts on what Schiff pulled:\n\nHear there is conflict inside Fiona Hill interview room. GOP Rep Gaetz came in. Not a member of Oversight/Intel/Foreign Affairs committees conducting interview. But Gaetz is a member of Judiciary, one of impeachment committees. Some disagreement going on. \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nAm told Rep Gaetz, a member of Judiciary Committee, was ordered out Fiona Hill interview room. \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nA member of the Judiciary Committee, one of the impeachment committees, kicked out.\n\nWhy or why would Schiff do that\n\nRep Schiff says impeachment hearings must be secret because they're like grand jury; can't let Trump side coordinate stories. Question: Will Schiff pledge to release all transcripts before public hearings and reasonable period of time before House votes on impeachment articles? pic.twitter.com/1DCrCZ9oCl \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nWait, what?\n\nBut it\u2019s not a grand jury, Schiff for Brains.\n\nImagine a member of the House Judiciary Committee wanting to know what was going on in an impeachment proceeding. The audacity! \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nTHE NERVE.\n\nTo the extent that it's a reminder that the public has a right to know everything that was said in that secret session before House votes on impeachment articles \u2014 it's a good thing. https://t.co/shoz16vg1Q \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nHow quickly they forget the public does indeed have the right to know what they\u2019re doing in these meetings before it goes to a vote.\n\nA House impeachment hearing is not a grand jury.https://t.co/WE2YR7URPY \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nAnd like clockwork, York speaks out in defense of Gaetz and calls Schiff out and the insults and accusations begin:\n\nIs @ByronYork a \"reporter\" or a Trump whisperer and conspiracy theory purveyor. Think we know the answer https://t.co/FVNmCi90PH \u2014 Barbara Tokay (@sci_writer) October 14, 2019\n\nThese people.\n\nYork responded.\n\nDo you believe the public has a right to know what is said in now-secret impeachment proceedings? https://t.co/4QEXQjNzTr \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nThen this \u2026\n\nWhen did Barr release muellers report ?! \u2014 Chriss (@currcl) October 14, 2019\n\n25 days after sending a letter summarizing it.https://t.co/99DOWIJS1T \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nDerp.\n\nI don't know. I think they should be released as soon as they are prepared. If Dems refuse to do that, they should be released a reasonable period of time before House votes on impeachment articles. https://t.co/gGgkVyHlRX \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 14, 2019\n\nAs secretive as Schiff has been we have our doubts.\n\nBut we can always hope.\n\nRelated:\n\nProject Veritas BOMBSHELL! Nothing to see here, just CNN\u2019s Jeff Zucker directing employees to push impeachment\n\nALL dirty?!
