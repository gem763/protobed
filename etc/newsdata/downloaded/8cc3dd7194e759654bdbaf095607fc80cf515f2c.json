But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money. ... The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney said Trump had not, however, had a similar quid pro quo involving the other investigation he desired \u2014 the one involving the Bidens. \u201cThe money held up had absolutely nothing to do with Biden,\u201d he said.\n\nMulvaney didn\u2019t directly use the phrase \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d but he didn\u2019t take issue with it, either.\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d he said when it was pointed out that he appeared to be describing a quid pro quo. He added: \"I have news for everybody: Get over it. There\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe White House issued a statement from Mulvaney late Thursday afternoon, in which he claimed the media misconstrued his remarks.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cThe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server. The only reasons we were holding the money was because of concern about lack of support from other nations and concerns over corruption . . . There never was any condition on the flow of the aid related to the matter of the DNC server.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut in the moment, instead of disputing it, Mulvaney suggested this particular quid pro quo was par for the course when it comes to foreign policy. He compared it to withholding aid to the Northern Triangle countries in Central America \u2014 El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala \u2014 to get them to reduce the flow of undocumented immigrants. He also likened it to Trump complaining about giving aid to Puerto Rico, which, like Ukraine, has issues with corruption.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely ordinary course of business. This is what you do,\u201d Mulvaney said, adding: \u201cThis is the ordinary course of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe parallels with the Northern Triangle countries and Puerto Rico, though, are limited. The United States has an obvious interest in protecting its border, which was particularly the case earlier this year when the flow of people rapidly accelerated. There is a clear policy interest \u2014 and one that administrations of both parties would share. Similarly, there are legitimate issues involving Puerto Rico and corruption (regardless of whether you think such aid should be withheld from a U.S. territory over it).\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of the origins of the Russia probe, by contrast, there is a much more obvious personal angle for Trump. Trump has lodged a number of conspiracy theories about Ukraine allegedly falsely implicating Russia in the 2016 election interference, despite the U.S. intelligence community and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III having found Russia culpable. Trump may argue there is a public and governmental interest in finding out how the probe was launched, but there is absolutely no question this is his personal hobby horse \u2014 and an investigation that he could use to his great personal advantage.\n\nThere is also no question that Trump and the White House have previously denied any kind of a quid pro quo. Trump has stated that and referred to supposed evidence that there wasn\u2019t one.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo,\u201d Trump said Sept. 22. \u201cThere was nothing.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo, but there was with Biden, and there was with these senators,\u201d Trump said Sept. 25.\n\n\u201cThere was no quid pro quo,\u201d he said again Oct. 2.\n\nHe also repeatedly tweeted other people who said the same.\n\n....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cThe witness was asked at least 20 times, and there definitely was no Quid Pro Quo.\u201d @RepMarkMeadows @FoxNews Their whole case was built around this, now they no longer mention! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cWhen your making an unsubstantiated statement that the President is making a claim having to do with quid pro quo, this witness has blown a big hole into that statement. The Ambassador put a dagger in the heart of Schiffs fairytale.\u201d Rep. Lee Zeldin \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2019\n\nThe fact that Mulvaney sought to separate the now-acknowledged quid pro quo from the issue of the Bidens is also telling. In that case, Trump\u2019s personal interest is even more obvious, because it involves the candidate who led in 2020 Democratic primary polls until recently and fares the best against him in early general election polls.\n\nThe issue involving Ukraine and the origins of the Russia probe is more complicated. There\u2019s also a U.S. Justice Department investigation into it, with Attorney General William P. Barr getting involved. But it\u2019s important to note that however opaque that issue might be, Trump\u2019s own personal interest in it is completely transparent. He has been calling the Russia investigation a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d for two years and has repeatedly highlighted Ukraine as a place where that could be proved.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Democrats \u201cget hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won\u2019t let the FBI see their server,\u201d Trump said in April 2017, adding: \u201cThey brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based. That\u2019s what I heard. I heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian.\u201d\n\nHe brought it up again in an interview with the Washington Examiner. Then, in July 2017, he tweeted about \u201cUkrainian efforts to sabotage the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nUkrainian efforts to sabotage Trump campaign - \"quietly working to boost Clinton.\" So where is the investigation A.G. @seanhannity \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017\n\nAs The Post\u2019s Craig Timberg, Drew Harwell and Ellen Nakashima reported, though, the theory involving the CrowdStrike server and Ukraine is a long-standing myth pushed by right-wing media personalities and disreputable politicians in Ukraine:\n\nPeople familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said he has come to suspect the DNC server hacked by Russian intelligence agents in 2016 may have been hidden in Ukraine. The president has been known to embrace conspiracy theories, but it wasn\u2019t immediately clear how he reached that belief about the DNC server or how that would even have been physically possible. ... In June 2017, the conservative news site Daily Caller said \u201ca cloud of doubt (was) hanging over the DNC\u2019s Russia narrative\u201d in part due to the involvement by CrowdStrike, which it said was \u201cFunded By Clinton-Loving Google $$.\" A month later, the conservative Washington Times wrote that \u201cCrowdStrike\u2019s evidence for blaming Russia for the hack is thin.\" That theory has been boosted by [Roger] Stone, Trump\u2019s longtime adviser, who has argued in legal filings this year that CrowdStrike\u2019s analysis was fatally compromised. Stone and others in Trump\u2019s orbit have alleged without evidence that Democratic insiders spearheaded the breach. Trump\u2019s mention of CrowdStrike suggests he still doubts the intelligence community\u2019s findings of Russian involvement.\n\nSo why did Mulvaney come out and admit it? It seems likely because the evidence increasingly points in that direction. Better to get ahead of it and combat the idea that what did happen was corrupt.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that this disclosure was slow-coming \u2014 and apparently it was slow-coming for a reason.\n\nAD", "description": "But he insisted it wasn't a corrupt one.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/h3lnV2iFsxjqOEsWTQdVdF4Dlw4=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-17-2019/t_434e1e0ba55e4456a16aeaa131baf859_name_20191017_00_01_39_21_Still015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
