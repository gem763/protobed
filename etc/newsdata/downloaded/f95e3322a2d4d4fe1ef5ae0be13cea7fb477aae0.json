Add Interest\n\nThe Denver Zoo finally welcomed a new male cub to its group of lions -- a feat that was months in the making and involved an entire team of specialists working to preserve the fragile species.\n\nThe cub, born in late July, made his public debut Wednesday and already has a slew of social media fans who have fallen in love with the young lion\u2019s playful antics.\n\nBecky Perlow/ABC News\n\nBut while the zoo\u2019s visitors are applauding the new cub\u2019s first steps outside his den, the zoo\u2019s keepers are acutely aware of the meticulous planning that went in to bringing this cub to life.\n\n\u201cGenetics are a huge part of what we are looking at when we\u2019re breeding animals or when we receive recommendations to move animals for breeding,\u201d explained Matt Lenyo, the zoo\u2019s assistant curator of predators.\n\nBecky Perlow/ABC News\n\nLenyo and his team work with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), a non-profit organization made up of 230 institutions from around the world that focus on conservation, education, science and recreation. In this case, the AZA helps accredited zoos determine which lions should breed with other lions, so that zoos can maintain genetic diversity.\n\n\u201cMost of the breeding that we do is meant to keep the population stable so that future generations have lions,\u201d said Senior Vice President of Animal Sciences Brian Aucone.\n\nThere are fewer than 25,000 lions left in Africa, according to National Geographic, whose parent company Disney, also owns ABC News. Loss of prey, loss of habitat and poaching have all contributed to the rapid decline of the species.\n\nThe Denver Zoo currently has a bachelor pride of four male brothers, as well as three females, which includes the new cub\u2019s mother, Neliah.\n\nBecky Perlow/ABC News\n\nEarlier this year, Neliah and another female lion had birth control implants removed by the zoo\u2019s vet team. While under anesthesia to remove the devices, the veterinary team performed full diagnostic work-ups which included blood work, X-rays, ultrasounds, vaccinations and a full reproductive exam.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do everything we could to make sure [they were] healthy before breeding [them],\u201d said Associate Veterinarian Dr. Betsy Stringer.\n\nNeliah was then introduced to Tobias, a new male lion the zoo had brought in to mate with her.\n\nCourtesy Denver Zoo\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important as we\u2019re doing introductions that they are off that birth control and they\u2019re excited to see that male,\u201d explained Lenyo.\n\nThe gestation period for a lion is around three months, and lions can have litters of one to five cubs. This new cub is the third for Neliah, who had another litter of two cubs three years ago.\n\nCourtesy Denver Zoo\n\n\u201cNeliah is very trusting of her keepers and of her staff, so she will actually allow us to move her away from him and she knows that she\u2019ll see him real soon after that,\u201d said Laura Morrell, a predator zookeeper who works with the new family behind the scenes.\n\nThe six-week-old cub has yet to be named, as the zoo is holding a naming contest where visitors can donate money in exchange for voting for their favorite choice.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
