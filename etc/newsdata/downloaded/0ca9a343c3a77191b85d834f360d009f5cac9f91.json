After Bryan Caraway pulled out of the event due to injury, \u201cChito\u201d was aligned to step in.\n\nHowever, Rivera declined the bout and cited Vera\u2019s standing in the division. Rivera also said he didn\u2019t want to hurt \u201cChito\u201d or take money away from Vera\u2019s daughter, who was struggling with health issues at the time.\n\nAlmost three years later, Vera wants to settle some unfinished business.\n\n\u201cI want Jimmie Rivera \u2013 I want to run this back,\u201d Vera told MMA Junkie. \u201cI feel of all the ranked guys it\u2019s the perfect fight. We were supposed to fight. The fight was announced. He pulled out with some dumb sort of excuse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad or upset, but I want to fight. I feel like that\u2019s the easiest fight, not because the guy is easy. It\u2019s easy to get because we already were scheduled to fight before. We can run it back.\u201d\n\nSince joining the UFC in 2014, Vera has been very open about his personal life. A family man, Vera publicly outlined his daughter\u2019s struggle with Mobius syndrome, a rare neurological condition.\n\nVera said he wasn\u2019t fazed by Rivera\u2019s comments at the time, and that\u2019s still the case now. Words are words, but Vera said he can use his actions inside the cage to take out Rivera once and for all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an emotional person when it comes to family,\u201d Vera said. \u201cBut in the sport, I have absolutely no feelings. You can say the worst. You can say gross things about my family. I\u2019ll probably laugh because I can\u2019t control what another man says. So I don\u2019t really give an (expletive) about that.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure about one thing: I will end his career. He\u2019s done and he\u2019s old, but he\u2019s got a good number next to his name. It will be so sweet to take it away from him and be there.\u201d\n\nVera\u2019s callout comes on the heels of Rivera having lost three out of his four most recent fights. After starting off his career 21-1, Rivera was knocked out by Marlon Moraes in June 2018. After a win against John Dodson in September 2018, Rivera lost back-to-back decisions to Aljamain Sterling and Petr Yan.\n\nWhile he credits Rivera for taking on such tough matchups, Vera thinks his momentum and abilities will be too much for \u201cEl Terror.\u201d A fight somewhere between November and February is what Vera is aiming for. Now there\u2019s no \u201cexcuse\u201d for Rivera to use to turn down the fight, said Vera.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fought tough guys, but I see how works,\u201d Vera said. \u201cThey were even fights until he breaks. He doesn\u2019t have the dog inside him any more. At this point, I will go back to him. A couple years ago he said he was too much for me. I was like, \u2018Okay. Whatever you want, son.\u2019 Now he\u2019s coming off of three losses in four fights. I\u2019m coming off of five finishes. Now, he can\u2019t say (expletive).\n\n\u201cNow, he has to take it like a man and run it back. Don\u2019t be a (expletive), Jimmie.\u201d\n\nGallery Marlon Vera def.
