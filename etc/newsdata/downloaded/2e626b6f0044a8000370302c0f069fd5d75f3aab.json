Every Democrat voted no.\n\nWalker, 37, \u201cdoes not presently have the requisite trial or litigation experience\u201d to be a federal judge, the ABA\u2019s Standing Committee concluded in a July review.\n\nThe nonpartisan ABA, which thoroughly reviews each of a president\u2019s judicial nominees, typically requires that someone chosen for a lifetime court seat have at least 12 years of experience practicing law. It\u2019s not an automatic disqualifier, though, if a nominee has other substantial trial or courtroom experience. Walker falls short on both counts.\n\n\u201cMr. Walker\u2019s experience to date has a very substantial gap, namely the absence of any significant trial experience,\u201d the ABA concluded. \u201cMr. Walker has never tried a case as lead or co-counsel, whether civil or criminal. ... In addition, based on review of his biographical information and conversations with Mr. Walker, it was challenging to determine how much of his ten years since graduation from law school has been spent in the practice of law.\u201d\n\nAhead of the committee vote, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) chided Republicans for voting to advance Walker despite his obvious lack of qualifications \u2015 something they\u2019ve done with other Trump court picks, too.\n\n\u201cSome of the people who have come before us have literally never, ever entered a courtroom in their lives,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThey may not have ever seen a \u201cPerry Mason\u201d show and certainly didn\u2019t stick around for the second half of any \u201cLaw and Order\u201d episode. Now they want to be trial judges for the rest of their natural lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d he added. \u201cThere have got to be more qualified Republican attorneys in America than the ones we\u2019re seeing before this committee.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) is wondering what is up with all these unqualified people getting lifetime appointments to federal court seats.\n\nTo date, since Trump became president, Senate Republicans have confirmed at least four lifetime federal judges who earned \u201cnot qualified\u201d ratings from the ABA.\n\nFor context, in his entire eight years in the White House, President Barack Obama didn\u2019t nominate anyone to be a lifetime federal judge who earned a \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA rating.\n\nWalker, a University of Louisville law professor who previously clerked for then-D.C. Circuit Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, may be a weak candidate for a federal judgeship, but he has a strong ally in the Senate: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who recommended him to the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is unquestionably the most outstanding nomination that I\u2019ve ever recommended to Presidents to serve on the bench in Kentucky,\u201d McConnell tweeted in July, just a day after the ABA issued its awful rating of Walker\u2019s qualifications.\n\nWhen Kavanaugh was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2018, Walker went out of his way to defend his former boss against credible allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her when they were high school students. Walker participated in more than 70 media interviews challenging Ford.\n\n\u201cShe may believe that assailant was Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d Walker claimed in a Fox News interview in September 2018. \u201cI believe she\u2019s mistaken.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s nomination now heads to the full Senate for a confirmation vote.", "description": "Justin Walker lacks the experience to be a lifetime federal judge, the American Bar Association says.
