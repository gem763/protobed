The Southeast Asian nation, which is one of the world's\n\nbiggest rice importers and often buys grains from its neighbours\n\nVietnam and Thailand, lifted a two-decade-old cap on purchases\n\nearly this year and replaced it with tariffs.\n\nThe policy shift has led to unhampered rice importation by\n\nthe private sector, with this year's purchases seen reaching a\n\nrecord annual volume of more than 3 million tonnes, way beyond\n\nwhat the country needs to fill the supply gap.\n\nWhile that helped bring down retail prices and ease\n\ninflation to the lowest in nearly three years in September, from\n\nits peak in almost a decade last year, farmers suffered as\n\nfarmgate prices plunged.\n\nThe fall in farmgate prices is not a nationwide concern,\n\nhowever, according to Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez, saying\n\nthose in central and southern Philippines in particular \"seem to\n\nbe holding up\".\n\n\n\n($1 = 51 Philippine pesos)\n\n\n\n", "description": "Philippines to nearly triple local rice purchases, scraps safeguard duty proposal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Rice_800x533_L_1421584916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
