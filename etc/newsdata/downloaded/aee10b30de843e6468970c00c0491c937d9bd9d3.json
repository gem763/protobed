Only one rider per device, and as is the case for drivers and cyclists, no mobile phone use will be allowed.\n\nMost of the new rules come into effect Saturday except for those that require technology tweaks \u2014 such as speed control \u2014 which will start on July 1.\n\nDjebbari said they will encourage \u201cmore responsible use\u2026 and restore a sense of tranquility for pedestrians, in particular the most vulnerable: the elderly, children and handicapped people.\u201d\n\nAs in cities worldwide, Paris is grappling with how to handle the roughly 15,000 \u201cdockless\u201d scooters that have flooded its streets since last year.\n\nA ban on parking them on sidewalks largely goes unheeded despite the threat of a 35-euro ($40) fine, and scooters can be found strewn over parks and squares across the French capital.\n\nCity Hall plans to cut the number of operators to three by issuing tender offers in the coming months, down from a peak of 12 earlier this year.\n\nAlready in June around half had withdrawn or suspended operations in Paris, citing high maintenance costs \u2014 vandalism remains a problem, as with the city\u2019s Velib bike-share system \u2014 and fierce competition.\n\nThe move will come once lawmakers pass the government\u2019s so-called Mobility law to govern free-float scooter sharing systems.\n\nBut critics say the rules may not be enough to address safety concerns for pedestrians as well as riders.\n\nLast weekend, a 25-year-old man was killed and a young woman seriously injured after the scooter they were riding was struck by a car in the southwestern city of Bordeaux.\n\nAt least five other scooter deaths have been reported in France, including Paris and its suburbs and the eastern city of Reims.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The French government issued Friday a series of rules on the use of e-scooters, whose exploding popularity has proved a headache for", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
