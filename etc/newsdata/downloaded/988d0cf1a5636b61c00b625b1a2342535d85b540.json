The Spanish ultra runner and his team were the last climbers on the mountains, so with their decision it appears no one will summit the peak this October season.\n\nCamp officials said Jornet was at the South Col, 8,400m, the final camp before a summit push, when he decided to turn around.\n\nHaving apparently set the speed record for climbing Everest with no supplementary oxygen in 2017, his feat was thrown into controversy when US climber Dan Howitt published an in-depth report raising questions around the lack of GPS, no summit photos, inconsistencies in reports and quotes and other unconventional behaviour, such as a lack of summit phone call.\n\nThe climbing community thought Jornet may be returning to set the record again and put the issue to bed. The\ufeffSCMP guessed he may be attempting to link Lhotse and Everest in a single push. His media team was coy and said he would release his goals only if and once they were achieved. We may now never know.\n\nOther climbers, including two Americans \u2013 Garrett Madison, Zac Bookman \u2013 and Kristin Bennett and extreme skier, Poland\u2019s Andrzej Leszek Bargiel, have all already withdrawn from their attempts because of the weather.\n\nIn contrast, earlier this year, in May, shocking images of traffic jams went viral as a good weather window combined with too many climbers, and too few experienced guides, resulting in a mad rush for the summit. Eleven people died as a result.", "description": "The Spanish runner has headed down to base camp, and as the last climbers on the mountain, it means no one will reach the top despite record breaking summits earlier", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/07/3d7e757e-e8bd-11e9-9e8e-4022fb9638c4_image_hires_142703.JPG?itok=LgrX0-nE&v=1570429627", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
