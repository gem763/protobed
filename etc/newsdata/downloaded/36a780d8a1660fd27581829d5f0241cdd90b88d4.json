Last season we only had one point after three games.\n\n\u201cNobody believed in us, but we went on to reach the final of the Champions League. That is why in football it\u2019s important how you start, but it\u2019s more important how you finish. In a long season you need to be calm and strong in your mentality.\u201d\n\nPochettino pointed out that he had turned Spurs into Champions League regulars, with the club in their fourth consecutive season in the competition despite operating on a smaller budget than their main rivals in England and Europe.\n\nTheir straitened circumstances, he added, had forced him to come up with innovative solutions on the pitch \u2014 like deploying midfielder Moussa Sissoko as an emergency right back when Serge Aurier was sent off against Southampton at the weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change this season... This is not new for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is new for the club is... seven years ago, we were playing... in the Europa League but now, for the fourth season in a row, we are playing Champions League.\n\n\u201c(We\u2019re) playing Barcelona, Inter Milan, Bayern Munich or Real Madrid or Manchester City. That changed a lot. This type of circumstances changes a lot for the club but my circumstances, poor circumstances, didn\u2019t change from five years ago to today.\u201d\n\nBayern, he added, were always one of the favourites for the title.\n\n\u201cThey are a club that every season, they prepare themselves to try to win the competition because the history says that,\u201d he said.", "description": "Beating Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday will help Tottenham Hotspur avoid a repeat of last season's late scramble to qualify for the knockout rounds, manager Mauricio Pochettino said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435663211&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T18G", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
