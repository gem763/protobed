To be honest, we only received this news several days ago.\"There are also growing concerns about radiation.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe previously insisted the crippled Fukushima power plant was nothing to worry about when Tokyo was bidding for the Games in 2013.However, with Typhoon Hagibis striking Fukushima, Japan's poor management of the contaminated waste was laid bare.Despite forecasts predicting torrential downpours, storage was not sufficient to stop an unknown number of bags containing contaminated waste from floating away and disappearing.Local officials insist the incident will not affect the environment, but half of the bags that were retrieved were found to be empty.Choi Jeong-yoon, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
