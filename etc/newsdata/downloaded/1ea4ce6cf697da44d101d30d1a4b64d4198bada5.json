But you only need one.", "language": "en", "text": "For improving a wine\u2019s flavor, however, the glass is more important than a decanter. The size and shape of a wine glass will affect the aromas and flavors, not just as you swirl and sip, but throughout your meal.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you need to invest in expensive crystal stemware, or a variety of differently shaped glasses. \u201cYou don\u2019t really need any other type of wine glass beyond an all-purpose glass,\u201d writes Maryse Chevriere, a sommelier and the James Beard Award-winning wine satirist of Fresh Cut Garden Hose on Instagram, in her new book, \u201cGrasping the Grape: Demystifying Grape Varieties to Help You Discover the Wines You Love.\u201d \u201cEspecially, if you\u2019re just starting to get into wine.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, if you are new to wine, or considering a gift to someone who is, what should you look for in an all-purpose glass? Chevriere lays out a few basic criteria.\n\n\u201cIf you only get to pick one, a clear, thin-lipped, \u2018cut rim\u2019 all-purpose glass should be it,\u201d she writes, describing it as \u201ca stemmed glass with a U-shaped bowl that is wider at the stem and narrows slightly as it gets up to the rim.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cIt\u2019s the wine glass equivalent of the perfect pair of jeans.\u201d\n\nThat U-shaped bowl is often called a tulip, because of its resemblance to the flower. The narrower rim focuses the aroma and guides the wine to your palate rather than down your shirt. The thin \u201ccut rim\u201d is favored over a thicker \u201crolled rim\u201d for the same reason.\n\nAD\n\nDifferent sizes, with glasses for white wines smaller than those for reds, evolved for a reason. White wines, such as riesling and sauvignon blanc, tend to be acidic, and a smaller, narrower tulip will direct them toward the tip of your tongue, while a bigger, wider glass will direct fleshier, tannic reds, such as cabernet sauvignon, to the middle of your palate \u2014 all in the hopes of balancing the wine and showing it at its best. Those bigger glasses may be ideal as well for full-bodied white wines, such as oaky chardonnay or skin-fermented \u201corange\u201d wines.\n\nAD\n\nSome stemware is marketed as all-purpose. \u201cThe One,\u201d by master sommelier Andrea Robinson, is actually two, with a white-wine version and a slightly larger red-wine glass. They sell for about $15 a stem on Amazon. A fancier glass by British wine writer Jancis Robinson and glass blower Richard Brendon goes for $112 a pair. It\u2019s delicate, precisely balanced and intended for use with sparkling and fortified wines, as well.\n\nBut, of course, you can find your own \u201call-purpose\u201d wine glass. Find one you like, with the specifications above for best results. You\u2019ll want something that not only fits your budget, but also feels good in your hand as you swirl the wine and tip the glass to your lips. That\u2019s not as silly or pretentious as it sounds: I\u2019ve used glasses that felt top-heavy, when swirling seems dangerous and the glass less steady on the table. These are most likely inexpensive department store stemware.\n\nAD\n\nIf you drink a lot of sparkling wine, be it champagne or prosecco, I suggest investing in a set of special glasses for bubbly. It\u2019s perfectly acceptable, even trendy, to drink sparkling from a regular glass, but smaller tulip-shaped stems, or even straight and narrow flutes, focus the bubbles \u2014 which, after all, put the sparkle in sparkling wine. They also help with portion control \u2014 important, given the price of champagne.\n\nAD\n\nI\u2019m not dismissing fancy, expensive wine glasses. They have elegance, and can help express the nuances of fine wine. And different-shaped glasses can draw out fruit flavors or emphasize oak. As with many aspects of wine, there\u2019s a lifetime of exploration for all of us.\n\nIf you\u2019re just starting out on your wine quest, find an all-purpose glass that suits you. Then branch out. As your love of wine develops, you\u2019ll want to explore different glassware, too. It can be expensive. But it doesn\u2019t have to be.\n\nMore from Food:\n\nAD", "description": "A good wine glass is like a perfect pair of jeans.", "authors": ["Dave Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LhSPMb3DWgojhYsULm1yV80AOLo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YQN2PSQVCII6TEFICNX2IS4AXI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
