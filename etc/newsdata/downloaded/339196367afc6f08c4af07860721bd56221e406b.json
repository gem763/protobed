Ron Helus, slain last year in a mass shooting.\n\nIn a recent interview with a local television station, Mr. Randall said Chief Hagel objected to co-sponsoring the event because \u201cRepublicans would attend.\u201d\n\nThe reality couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, Mr. McCoy said, adding that Chief Hagel was merely following a longstanding precedent of law enforcement of Ventura County of not participating in partisan events.\n\n\u201cPeople are trying to ruin a good man,\u201d Mr. McCoy said of Chief Hagel. \u201c[Thousand Oaks police officers] do not participate in partisan events, whether they be liberal or conservative. It is the policy of the department.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, headlines ran in news outlets that, Mr. McCoy argued, unfairly painted the chief as opposing Trump supporters.\n\nThe Times also reported that the \u201cBlue Bowl\u201d event, which was to be held this weekend to honor Helus at Newbury Park High School, had been canceled after Chief Hagel \u201creportedly dropped out and encouraged others to do the same\u201d because of expected attendance by actor and high-profile Trump supporter Scott Baio, who attended the same church as the slain officer, and singer-songwriter Joy Villa, famous for her \u201cMAGA\u201d-themed dress at the Grammy Awards, who was to sing the national anthem.\n\nIn an interview with Fox 11, Mr. Randall paraphrased a phone call he had with the police chief.\n\n\u201cHe basically said over and over in the conversation that this is not Trump country, that the slogan \u2018Make America Great\u2019 is not favorable, popular, within 1,2000 square miles, that we don\u2019t want Republicans here, I could not believe it,\u201d Mr. Randall told the Los Angeles television station.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. McCoy acknowledged on Friday that his city trends blue, but said Chief Hagel was following protocol.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t participate in political events,\u201d Mr. McCoy said. \u201cThat is a wall. We just don\u2019t. And a lot of the officials around here are Democrats. But they know, too, when to draw the line against political rallies.\u201d\n\nIn an email Friday to The Times, Mr. Randall stood by his account of the conversation with the police chief and asked why Mr. McCoy never raised the concern with him before.\n\n\u201cIf [Mr. McCoy] considered this a \u2018political\u2019 event, why didn\u2019t he say so when invited to speak?\u201d asked Mr. Randall, who said he had extended an invitation to speak at the charity game to the mayor.\n\nMr. Randall called on city and county leaders to donate money to the slain officer\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cWill those that killed this off now donate their own money to the family?\u201d Mr. Randall asked.\n\nMr. McCoy said that his office has received countless phone calls and email messages complaining about a political bias against Trump supporters.\n\n\u201cIf I lose my next election, fine, but I will not stay silent while people malign our officers,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a report in the Thousand Oaks Acorn, a local newspaper, Chief Hagel did not deny telling Mr. Randall in a phone call that Ventura County \u201cis not Trump country\u201d and felt some of the individuals invited to speak did not \u201crepresent the fabric of the community.\u201d\n\nThousand Oaks, which is in California\u2019s 26th Congressional District and is currently represented by Democrat Julia Brownley, supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election by double digits.\n\nIn November, a gunman opened fire inside a country music bar in Thousand Oaks packed with college students, killing 13 including Helus. The officer, a 29-year veteran of the force who had been set to retire this year, was among the first responders.\n\nMr. McCoy told The Times $4 million has been raised for Helus. He said Sunday\u2019s event was canceled by the promoter because the sheriff\u2019s department, as well as the officer\u2019s widow, had declined to attend.\n\n\u201cWe have many others planning fundraisers that [the department] may or may not participate in,\u201d Mr. McCoy said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
