Along with Austen\u2019s abandoned novel Lady Susan, these pieces are spikier, more difficult, and more resistant to the bonnets-and-breeches treatment than her published works are. (Lady Susan, which was turned into 2016\u2019s Love & Friendship, starring Kate Beckinsale, focuses on a widow trying to secure husbands for herself and her daughter. It is quietly radical: Imagine how different Pride and Prejudice would be told from the perspective of Mrs. Bennet.)\n\nThese new adaptations make a simple case: Costume dramas are not about wallowing in nostalgia, and Austen was not writing straightforward romances. Sanditon, for example, has an \u201cacerbic, screwball tone,\u201d according to its director, Olly Blackburn\u2014in it, Austen was trying something new. \u201cIt\u2019s like [Bob] Dylan going electric,\u201d he told me.\n\nAt first glance, the plot of The Watsons, which is showing at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London, is classic Austen\u2014a young woman who has fallen on hard times tries to find a husband. As soon as Wade was commissioned to adapt the fragment for the stage, though, she realized that she had to take liberties with the material. The playwright was enough of an Austen fan, she told me, \u201cto not want to do yet another Pride and Prejudice or whatever.\u201d\n\nIn her play, the characters are self-aware\u2014and notice a strange figure, named Laura, creeping around the period setting. Laura is a stand-in for the playwright herself, unable to resist seeing what an Austen story looks like from the inside. Realizing that they are actually in a play, the characters rebel against the confines of the narrative\u2014two begin a lesbian relationship and set sail for India, and the heroine, Emma, rejects all the options available to a genteel but poor young woman in the early 19th century.\n\nThe play is funny, surreal, and full of affectionate iconoclasm. Wade sees Austen as a \u201cbrilliantly witty friend,\u201d and was fascinated by why she abandoned The Watsons. Perhaps, Wade speculated, its premise was too close to Austen\u2019s own life: The heroine\u2019s father is dying, as was Austen\u2019s when she wrote it. And after Austen discarded The Watsons, there was a gap of several years before she wrote her final three novels. (During this period, she also received a marriage proposal, which she turned down, but her reasoning is unknown, as her sister Cassandra burned her letters.)\n\nOr maybe, Wade suggested, Austen abandoned The Watsons because she couldn\u2019t work out which of the male characters would be a suitable match for her protagonist. \u201cMaybe she couldn\u2019t finish your story in the way she wanted,\u201d the playwright-character Laura tells Emma. \u201cShe might have wanted to \u2026 make you some kind of amazing, bold, revolutionary feminist, but she thought her readers weren\u2019t ready, or she was scared of it.\u201d Wade said that the end of her script, which lets Emma explore the world without getting married, \u201cfelt like the more feminist thing that Jane Austen might have done if she were alive in a world where there were those possibilities.\u201d", "description": "A new wave of adaptations is uncovering a hidden side of the novelist.", "authors": ["Helen Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Austen2/facebook.jpg?1570092709", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
