A documentary about his WORK, not HIM. A lesson in being a Royal. Take note.'\n\nPrince Charles talks very little about his family or royal life in tonight's show, instead focusing on the work and people that live in his Duchy\n\nAnother said: 'Wow ! Love Prince Charles and Camilla. What a wonderful Man. We need to know more about our future King. Forget Megan so boring.'\n\nAnd the praise for Prince Charles was widespread, with one viewer saying: ' Thoroughly enjoying #InsidetheDuchy this evening - fascinating to hear about the balance between business and community, modernising and tradition. I do love Prince Charles and his work.'\n\nA second commented: 'Watching the Duchy of Cornwall and absolutely loving it.. What a visionary Prince Charles was/is.. Amazing TV.. Well played.'\n\nCaring for his tenants was a common theme, with one viewer saying: 'How wonderful is Prince Charles - so lovely to see how much he cares and that he tenants love him.'\n\nThe Duchy of Cornwall's keeper of records Alastair Martin described Prince Charles as 'very hands on' in his role, something that is reflected in the doc\n\nAt one point, one of the tenant farmers who live in the Duchy, said: 'He has no airs or graces, he's one of us. A lot of people don't know that other side of him, I believe'\n\nDuring the show, one of the tenant farmers who live in the Duchy, said: 'He has no airs or graces, he's one of us. A lot of people don't know that other side of him, I believe.'\n\nPrince Charles himself repeatedly stressed the importance of community on his estate, adding: 'The connection between my family and their family is the most important thing.'\n\nThe show gave a glimpse into the lives of some of Prince Charles' tenants.\n\nThey included Sam and Emily Stables, who rent 200 acres in Hertfordshire.\n\nSpeaking candidly on the programme, Prince Charles said: 'I feel that it\u2019s absolutely essential to provide opportunities for young people and those who are really keen, to provide them with a farm and a unit that is possible for them to start on.\n\n'What we do with the younger ones is try to select the, the applicants very carefully, the ones with the best chance, people who, who have a real sense of enthusiasm and energy and good ideas.'\n\nThe Duchy of Cornwall's keeper of records Alastair Martin described Prince Charles as 'very hands on' in his role.\n\nThe Duchy of Cornwall was set up in 1337 by Edward III to provide independence for his son and heir, and the tradition has continued since, with the Duchy being passed down to the next in line to the throne.\n\nRevenue from the extensive estate, which spans 23 counties, is used to fund the public, private and charitable activities of The Duke and his children.\n\nThe second episode will air next Thursday and feature Prince William and his preparations to take over the running of the estate from his father.\n\nThe show gave a glimpse into the lives of some of Prince Charles' tenants on his estate\n\nToday the estate is a private portfolio of land, financial investments and property including the Oval cricket ground (pictured) in Kennington, south London, and 67,000 acres of Dartmoor\n\nThe Duchy of Cornwall covers more than 130,000 acres across 23 counties (pictured: Duchy tenants Emily and Sam Stables)\n\nIn a teaser clip released before the show, Prince Charles admitted he was 'practically reduced to tears' after his son William took an interest in taking over the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge spoke about his 'passion' for farming and revealed that his children are already playing on tractors as he prepares to one day inherit the Duchy - a private portfolio of land, financial investments and property - from his father.\n\nWilliam appears in a two-part documentary series commissioned by ITV to mark the Prince of Wales's 50th working year as the Duke of Cornwall.\n\nIt shows William meeting farmers as he prepares to take over running the estate when his father accedes to the throne.\n\nIn the documentary, Charles admits he is 'touched' that William has taken an interest in the Duchy.\n\n'When I saw it, I couldn't believe it, I was deeply touched and moved by what he said,' Charles said.\n\n'It practically reduced me to tears.\n\n'Because I suddenly thought, well, just hearing that from him, has made the last 50 years worthwhile.'\n\nIn another clip, Prince Charles admitted taking on the Duchy of Cornwall estate at the age of 21 was a 'baptism of fire' - and called son Prince William 'lucky' for having the luxury of time to learn all about it.\n\nCharles (pictured) took over management of the estate when he was 21 and hopes in his time in charge he's supported its people\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, around 3,800 people were living in homes across Poundbury, above\n\nThe Prince of Wales, 70, is preparing for the day his eldest son will take over the estate after spending 50 years at the helm.\n\nIn a two-part documentary series commissioned by ITV to mark the anniversary, he admitted that he's 'touched' to see his eldest son take an interest.\n\nSpeaking on Prince Charles: Inside The Duchy Of Cornwall, which will air at 9pm on Thursday, he said: '[William is] quite lucky because I found myself there at 21. I had a bit of baptism of fire really.\n\n'He goes and visits different parts of the Duchy of Cornwall, and so he is learning, I hope, as time goes by.'\n\nHis village of Poundbury was also featured in the documentary.\n\nThe controversial settlement has attracted a slew of negativity but Prince Charles defended it on the documentary.\n\nHe said: 'I got on in spite of the endless criticism, shouting and screaming, because I've always believe in the long-term.'\n\nPoundbury homeowners have criticised Prince Charles' 'Utopian' village as 'soulless' and 'a lot like Marmite' in a behind-the-scenes documentary exploring the Duchy of Cornwall estate. Pictured: The Duke and Duchess of Cornwall walk through Poundbury in 2016\n\nThe Duchy of Cornwall is worth an estimated \u00a31billion and spans properties across the south of the United Kingdom including the Scilly Isles, Wales and London\n\nBut residents of his 'Utopian' village in Dorset have claimed living there is 'soulless' and 'a lot like Marmite'.\n\nSeveral residents also bemoaned the many regulations that must be followed when living in the model idyll.\n\nPoundbury, which mixes private and affordable housing side-by-side, is owned by Charles' Duchy of Cornwall estate.\n\nThe royal used Duchy farmland to start building the project in 1993 to demonstrate his own vision of Britain, where he aimed to give everyone a job and have a walkable community - giving priority to people rather than to cars.\n\nA source close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex (pictured) has hit out at the palace and said the institution around the royal family is full of people 'inexperienced' at how best to 'deploy and harness their value'\n\nBut for fear of his picturesque village being ruined, homeowners must get Charles' permission if they want to change the colour of their front door or even give their house a name.\n\nAnd any extension not only requires normal planning permission from the local council but Duchy approval too.\n\nOne resident confessed in the programme: 'It's a bit sort of a Marmite place, where you either love it or hate it.'\n\nAnother said: 'I don't think it has soul. It's unlike anywhere else I've been in Dorset,' while their friend told the camera: 'There's a lot of rules and regulations. Like for instance, some people can't even have satellite dishes.'\n\nPrince Charles' documentary comes after a controversial ITV production on Harry and Meghan's trip to Africa.\n\nHarry and Meghan opened up in a behind-the-scenes documentary on Sunday, which followed the couple during their ten-day tour of South Africa.\n\nDuring the documentary aired on ITV on Sunday night, Prince Harry (pictured above) revealed his feelings about his royal duties\n\nIn ITV's 'Harry & Meghan: An African Journey', Meghan said she was 'existing not living' while Harry shared his struggles with mental health.\n\nThe Duchess also described struggling with public scrutiny, as well as the 'damaging' impact of a British stiff upper lip.\n\nAsked by ITN News At Ten host Tom Bradby about the 'impact on your physical and mental health of all the pressure that you clearly feel under', she said: 'I would say - look, any woman, especially when they are pregnant, you are really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging.\n\n'And then when you have a newborn, you know? And especially as a woman it's really, it's really a lot.'\n\nMeghan also admitted 'not many people' had checked how she was truly coping - a confession some commentators have seen as a swipe at the Royal Family.\n\nShe said: 'Well, I guess, and also thank you for asking, but not many people have asked if I'm okay, but it's a very real thing behind the scenes.'\n\nPrince Charles is 'furious' that his sons' reported feuds have 'completely undermined' and 'utterly annihilated' his own work abroad, a royal source has claimed\n\nThe prince is questioned about his relationship with his brother (pictured, with wife Kate) in which he appears to confirm there has been rift\n\nPrince Harry voiced his fears of 'a repeat of the past' and how he wants to protect his family from the media.\n\nHe also told the programme about his relationship with his brother, saying they have 'good days' and 'bad days' and are travelling on 'different paths'.\n\nIn the documentary, the Duke of Sussex acknowledged there had been deepening tensions between himself and William following months of speculation about the state of the brothers' relationship.\n\nPalace aides had repeatedly denied reports of a rift between the Sussexes and the Cambridges, who had once been championed as the Royal family's 'Fab Four'\n\nBut when asked how much of the speculation was true, Harry pointedly refused to deny a falling out.\n\nIt triggered a response from William as an insider told the BBC that he was worried Harry and Meghan were in a 'fragile place.'\n\nA source close to the couple later defended them, telling CNN that the royal family was not able to harness the power of the couple, who they said, had single-handedly modernised the monarchy.\n\nAccording to the source Harry was just giving an 'honest answer' about William and that any sibling seeing that 'would of course be concerned.'\n\nRoyal commentators also expressed their discontent with the actions of Harry and Meghan, and said the Queen and senior royals are 'very worried' about the direction the 'divisive' couple are heading.\n\nAnd yesterday, according to a royal source, Prince Charles said he was 'furious' that his sons' reported feuds have 'completely undermined' and 'utterly annihilated' his own work abroad.\n\nA royal insider told the Sun: 'The Prince of Wales is very busy at the moment touring Japan, including a visit with the Welsh rugby team. But the point is that this whole kerfuffle has completely undermined the work he is doing, just as it undermined the work Prince William and Kate were doing in Pakistan.\n\n'To do it to your brother is one thing. To do it to your father and paymaster is a completely different matter altogether.'\n\nThe source added that Charles is 'worrying about Harry in the same way he did Diana', insisting the Prince of Wales will 'defend his son' publicly.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle's 'different path' revealed: Sussex Royal foundation unveils its plans to operate in all 53 Commonwealth countries By SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE FOR THE DAILY MAIL He has acknowledged that he and his older brother are 'on different paths' \u2014 and Prince Harry, I can disclose, is staying true to his word. For yesterday, Sussex Royal, the foundation which he and Meghan established on July 1, published the full list of the countries where it intends to operate. And it named all 53 Commonwealth nations, from Australia and Canada to Kiribati \u2014 a speck of land marooned in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, visit a Justice Desk initiative in Nyanga, South Africa in September 'Their Royal Highnesses have both been inspired by the people and organisations they have met throughout the Commonwealth,' a spokesman for the foundation tells me. 'Especially young people, whether on tour, through events like Commonwealth Heads Of Government Meetings, or organisations such as the Queen's Commonwealth Trust, the Queen's Commonwealth Canopy and The Queen's Young Leaders. 'They believe the Commonwealth can play a significant role in solving the social and environmental issues the world faces, and will therefore be an important part of their work through Sussex Royal.' Sussex Royal, the foundation which Harry and Meghan established on July 1, has published the full list of the countries where it intends to operate - including all 53 Commonwealth countries The unequivocal statement of intent demonstrates the scale of the Sussexes' ambition as well as the commitment that Meghan vividly illustrated at the couple's wedding, when her veil was embroidered with one wildflower from each Commonwealth country \u2014 plus one for her home state of California and another representing Nottingham Cottage, her first home with Harry. The Royal Foundation, which William (left with the Duchess of Cambridge) and Harry established a decade ago, simply says it operates in 'England and Wales' By contrast, the Royal Foundation, which William and Harry established a decade ago and from which Harry and Meghan diverged their own activities earlier this year, adheres to the understated style which has become the hallmark of William and Kate's endeavours. Rather than providing a full list of countries, it simply says that it operates in 'England and Wales', though further explaining that, in practice, also 'overseas'. Indeed, some of its conservation projects are in southern and eastern Africa, as well as in India \u2014 so it seems that the brothers' paths, though differing, will periodically cross in the years ahead. No matter how many countries the Duke and Duchess of Sussex cite as their sphere of operation, the person who wields the real power is, of course, a future King of England.", "description": "Viewers took to social media to praise Prince Charles for making a programme on the intricacies of his work, urging Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to 'take note'.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/22/20155160-0-image-a-27_1571952532446.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
