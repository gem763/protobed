Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only interested in corruption. I don\u2019t care about politics. I don\u2019t care about Biden\u2019s politics,\u201d Mr. Trump told White House reporters on his way to visit wounded veterans at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\n\nMr. Trump, furiously combating House Democrats pursuing impeachment, alleges Hunter Biden inappropriately leveraged his father\u2019s position in the Obama administration to line his pockets around the globe.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, he said Ukraine and China ought to look into it all, prompting Democrats to accuse him of committing crimes in broad daylight, namely by soliciting foreign help in domestic politics.\n\nSome critics were especially concerned that Beijing would tie the call for an investigation to an ongoing trade dispute.\n\nMr. Trump said the Bidens are the ones vulnerable vis-a-vis Beijing, citing Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to an investment fund that dealt with the Bank of China.\n\nHe said Mr. Biden, as president, would \u201cgive them everything\u201d on trade.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden would just roll out the red carpet,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nMr. Trump says he has a \u201cduty\u201d to look into corruption, even if it means getting help from other countries, though Democrats say his newfound mission pivots on the man who leads him many 2020 polls.\n\nDemocrats mainly have faulted Mr. Trump for asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to look into the Bidens and a Democratic National Committee server from 2016 during a July 25 phone call.\n\nMr. Trump says there is nothing in the call that suggests a quid pro quo, meaning a request for help in exchange for something material, such as the military aid he held back from Kyiv for weeks.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the whole ballgame,\u201d he told reporters Friday.\n\nDemocrats released text messages from State Department officials late Thursday that they said reflected concerns Mr. Trump did, in fact, withhold aid to Ukraine to pressure the country into launching \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d investigations.\n\nMr. Trump said he didn\u2019t see anything nefarious.\n\n\u201cThere is no pro quo,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat was in the text message that I saw and it nullified everything.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
