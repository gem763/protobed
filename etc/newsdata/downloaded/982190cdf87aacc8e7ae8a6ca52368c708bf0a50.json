It\u2019s not appropriate for a president to engage a foreign government in an investigation of a political opponent,\u201d Portman said in an interview with the Columbus Dispatch\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump suggested the foreign governments look into the Biden family\u2019s business dealings in the two countries, as House Democrats race to complete a so-called impeachment \u201cinquiry\u201d over the president\u2019s July telephone call with the leader of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens, because what happened in China is just about as bad as Ukraine,\u201d the president told reporters outside the White House ahead of a visit to Florida to deliver remarks on medicare.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Hunter Biden\u2019s investment firm locked down a $1.5 billion investment deal with the Bank of China after traveling with his father on Air Force Two to the country in 2013.\n\nFurther, President Trump reported his call for Ukraine to look into the Biden family\u2019s activities in the eastern European country, saying: \u201cNobody has any doubt that they weren\u2019t crooked; that was a crooked deal 100 percent.\u201d\n\nAs Breitbart News reported earlier this year:\n\nBiden forced out former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin as he was investigating an energy company called Burisma Holdings, which was paying Biden handsomely as a member of its board. The former vice president even boasted to the Council of Foreign Relations last year that he had threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. aid unless the prosecutor was fired. (He did not tell the audience about his son\u2019s role.)\n\nPortman\u2019s comments place him in a small group of Republican senators who have expressed disapproval of the president\u2019s suggestion. Sens. Mitt Romney (R-UT), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Ben Sasse (R-NE) have also spoken against it.\n\nOn Friday, Romney, a staunch critic of Trump, declared the president\u2019s call for a probe into Biden was \u201cwrong and appalling,\u201d while Collins said Saturday that it was \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d", "description": "Rob Portman\u00a0criticized President Donald Trump for urging China and Ukraine to look into allegations of corruption against Joe Biden.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/05/Joe-and-Hunter-Biden-in-China-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
