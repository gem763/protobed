Since before he was even inaugurated.\n\nThere was this racy headline, from Vanity Fair on Nov. 14, 2016: \u201cWill Trump Be Impeached?\u201d\n\nThen this, yet another Vanity Fair piece, on Dec. 15, 2016: \u201cDemocrats Are Paving the Way to Impeach Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThere was this, from The New York Times, in an opinion headline from Nov. 3, 2016: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Impeachment Threat.\u201d\n\nRemember: Trump wasn\u2019t inaugurated until Jan. 20, 2017. He wasn\u2019t even elected president until Nov. 8, 2016.\n\nRemember, too: The Republican Party primaries didn\u2019t wrap until June 2016. And Trump wasn\u2019t formally nominated at the Republican National Convention as the Republican Party\u2019s candidate for president until July 19, 2016.\n\nYet Politico, on April 17, 2016, posed this in a headline: \u201cCould Trump be impeached shortly after he takes office?\u201d The piece went on to state that \u201cIt\u2019s highly improbable, but everyone from law scholars to political junkies are speculating about it.\u201d\n\nApril 17, 2016.\n\nBefore Trump was even the GOP\u2019s chosen one.\n\nAnd definitely before Trump was even the elected one.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump isn\u2019t even the Republican nominee yet,\u201d as Politico wrote at the time. \u201cBut his incendiary rhetoric \u2026 has critics on the right and the left discussing the most extreme of countermeasures at an unusually early point in the race.\u201d\n\nThe piece went on to note that everyone from constitutional scholars, media pundits and members of Congress \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives \u2014 were talking up the impeachment of Trump. And that\u2019s before he was elected. That\u2019s before he was inaugurated. That\u2019s before he took office.\n\nImagine that.\n\nKind of gives buoyancy to those who think the whole \u201cImpeach Trump\u201d rally cry is more bogus than based on any sort of justice for the American people. After all, it\u2019s hard enough to impeach absent impeachable offense, never mind trying to impeach absent an office.\n\n\u201c@SpeakerPelosi\u2019s decision to pursue impeachment now \u2014 on the basis of unsubstantiated, indirect, and anonymous allegations \u2014 only shows that the [s]peaker has finally succumbed to unrelenting pressure from the Socialist wing of the Democrat Party,\u201d Jordan tweeted.\n\nAnd he followed that with this: \u201cThis was never about Russian collusion or Ukrainian prosecutions. It is all about undoing the 2016 election and the will of the American people,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHave to agree.\n\nSo should you.\n\nGrab the popcorn and settle in for the show. This 2020 White House ride is going to make 2016 seem tame by comparison.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
