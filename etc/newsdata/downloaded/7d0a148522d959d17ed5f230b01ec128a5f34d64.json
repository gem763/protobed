It will hopefully make them stand up and notice what we are going through.\n\n\"I am very nervous about it but I am so determined to make sure that those who make the decisions sit up and listen to us.\n\n\"The message is that we want funding from the NHS.\n\n\"The first of November will make a year to the day that the law was changed to allow clinicians to prescribe medical cannabis.\"\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nKaren, who will strike with 17 other mums in London, relies on fundraising to pay for the cannabis oil she orders in.\n\nAfter meeting Health Secretary Matt Hancock several months ago Karen was hopeful he would intervene.\n\nShe said: \"Matt Hancock told us to our faces he would do all he can to help us but that's not been the case.\n\n\"In the press we hear about advances for people with cerebral palsy etc but what about us? We have been asking for months to have this fully funded.\n\n\"I know one family that are having to re-mortgage their house to pay for the cannabis oil. That shouldn't be happening .\"\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\nThe law changed in the UK last year to allow the prescription of medical cannabis but only in certain circumstances.\n\nA spokesman from the Department of Health and Social care told BBC Scotland : \"We sympathise with those families dealing so courageously with challenging conditions. The law has been changed to allow specialist doctors to prescribed cannabis-based products for medicinal use where clinically appropriate.\n\n\"However, there is a clear consensus on the need for more evidence to support such prescribing decisions.\n\n\"Government is working with the health system, the industry, researchers, and others to improve the evidence base for these products so that decisions can be made about public funding and to provide clinicians with further support and guidance on prescribing these products where clinically appropriate.\"", "description": "Karen Gray, will be campaigning with 17 other mums in Downing Street after November 1", "authors": ["Peter Davidson", "Image", "Daily Record"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20732283.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_CMP_SDR_130919MurrayGrayCannabis_02JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
