Here\u2019s what we know about the conversations.", "language": "en", "text": "House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) has said that Congress is particularly interested in finding the records of Trump\u2019s calls with Putin, especially if they had been stored in an unorthodox way. The Kremlin initially said it did not want the conversations made public, though Putin said Wednesday that he would not be against it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccounts of Trump\u2019s private conversations with other senior Russian officials have already drawn criticism, including one in the Oval Office in 2017 in which Trump said he was unconcerned about Kremlin election interference. The remarks prompted the White House to limit access to the remarks, former officials told The Washington Post.\n\nBelow is a timeline of what is publicly known about Trump and Putin\u2019s conversations through phone calls and in person.\n\nJan. 28, 2017\n\nTrump and Putin shared a congratulatory call after Trump\u2019s inauguration. A White House readout of the call said that it lasted about an hour and included discussions about Syria and the threat posed by the Islamic State and that the \u201cpositive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAccording to subsequent reporting from Reuters, Putin raised the possibility of extending a 2010 treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads. Trump asked aides what the treaty, known as New START, was before denouncing it, Reuters reported.\n\nApril 3, 2017\n\nTrump called Putin after a terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg subway. According to the White House readout, Trump \u201cexpressed his deepest condolences to the victims and their loved ones, and to the Russian people.\u201d\n\nMay 2, 2017\n\nTrump and Putin spoke by phone about Syria and North Korea, according to the White House.\n\nJuly 7, 2017\n\nThe two leaders meet for the first time in person on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg. The meeting was also attended by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and interpreters, who later told reporters that the meeting had lasted two hours and covered the war in Syria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Post later reported that Trump had taken the unusual step of taking notes from his own interpreter after the meeting and instructing the employee not to discuss the details of the meeting, effectively limiting the amount of information other officials could learn about the meeting.\n\nTrump also informally spoke with Putin at a dinner for the G-20 leaders later in the day. The U.S. president approached his Russian counterpart, and the only other party to the conversation was Putin\u2019s interpreter, according to officials present.\n\nNov. 11, 2017\n\nThough the White House said there would be no formal meeting between Trump and Putin at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Danang, Vietnam, the U.S. president later said he had spoken to the Russian leader informally at the event.\n\nAD\n\nTrump said he had \u201ctwo or three\u201d brief conversations with Putin that mostly centered on the war in Syria and Russian election interference. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t meddle,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nAD\n\nNov. 21, 2017\n\nTrump and Putin spoke for an hour on the phone about the U.S.-Russia relationship and the conflict in Syria, according to the White House.\n\nDec. 14, 2017\n\nTrump spoke with Putin on the phone to thank him for \u201cacknowledging America\u2019s strong economic performance in his annual press conference,\u201d according to the White House, which said the pair also talked about North Korea.\n\nDec. 17, 2017\n\nPutin called Trump to thank him for the warning that U.S. intelligence agencies gave Russia about a terrorist plot in St. Petersburg, according to the White House.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPresident Putin extended his thanks and congratulations to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Mike Pompeo and the CIA,\u201d the readout said. \u201cPresident Trump then called Director Pompeo to congratulate him, his very talented people, and the entire intelligence community on a job well done!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFeb. 12, 2018\n\nTrump called Putin to offer his condolences after a plane crash in Russia killed 71 people, according to the White House, which also said that the two leaders discussed the Israel-Palestinian peace process and North Korea.\n\nMarch 20, 2018\n\nTrump called Putin after his reelection to the Russian presidency to congratulate him, according to the White House. The Post later reported that Trump had been given briefing notes that warned him \u201cDO NOT CONGRATULATE\u201d before the call.\n\nAD\n\nA week later, the Kremlin said that Trump had proposed meeting Putin at the White House for the Russian leader\u2019s first visit since 2005.\n\nJuly 16, 2018\n\nTrump and Putin met face-to-face again for a bilateral summit in Helsinki. The two leaders spoke for two hours, joined only by their interpreters, before holding a 46-minute news conference in which Trump said that Putin had made an \u201cextremely strong and powerful\u201d denial that Russia interfered with the U.S. election.\n\nAD\n\nA full account of what was discussed in the private meeting has never been offered, despite lawmakers\u2019 attempts to get interpreters\u2019 notes from the discussion.\n\nLimited and sometimes contradictory accounts of the talks have leaked out. According to The Post, John Bolton, national security adviser at the time, told senior officials that Trump had told Putin that U.S. troops would stay in Syria until Iranians left. Kremlin officials have spoken of \u201cagreements\u201d reached during the meeting, without going into specifics.\n\nAD\n\nNov. 30, 2018\n\nTrump and Putin were both at the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires, but the U.S. president canceled a planned meeting just hours after the Kremlin had announced it, blaming the decision on Russia\u2019s seizure of Ukrainian naval ships and sailors in the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, the Financial Times later reported that the two world leaders and their wives had talked for 15 minutes at an event at the Buenos Aires opera house. An unnamed Russian official told the newspaper that the discussion had been about whether they could meet formally, as well as the situations in Ukraine and Syria, and that only a Russian interpreter was present.\n\nAD\n\nMay 3, 2019\n\nTrump told reporters that he and Putin discussed the end of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election during a phone call but that he didn\u2019t tell Putin not to interfere in the next election.\n\nAD\n\nThen-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had told reporters earlier in the day that the call lasted slightly more than an hour and also included discussion of nuclear agreements, North Korea, Venezuela and trade.\n\nJune 28, 2019\n\nTrump met with Putin one the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Osaka, Japan. The two leaders met for 90 minutes, mostly without journalists present. Russian state media reported that Putin invited Trump to Moscow to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in 2020.\n\nBefore the private meeting, Trump was asked by journalists whether he would warn Putin not to interfere in future U.S. elections, prompting the U.S. president to jokingly reprimand the Kremlin leader. \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election,\u201d Trump said while wagging a finger.\n\nJuly 31, 2019\n\nTrump and Putin spoke by phone to discuss wildfires in Siberia and trade between the two nations, according to the White House. The call was first announced by the Russians, and the U.S. statement came hours after the Kremlin released its own account of the call.\n\nThe White House only now sends a readout of today's call between Trump and Putin:\n\n\n\n\"President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Vladimir Putin today and expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia. The leaders also discussed trade between the two countries.\u201d \u2014 Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) August 1, 2019", "description": "The president's conversations with his Russian counterpart have been controversial since he entered office.", "authors": ["Adam Taylor", "Foreign Reporter Who Writes About A Variety Of Subjects"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UONBy5O_itco8YlT2dSXLn8p6V0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FPIAVIEZREI6TGQW3RKR5JNEHM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
