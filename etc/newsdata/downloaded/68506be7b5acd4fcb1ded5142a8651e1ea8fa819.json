Processing includes obtaining, recording, storing, sharing, deleting and otherwise using information.\n\nBundesliga clubs only release information if a player has suffered a serious injury. For example, Bayern Munich confirmed that Niklas Sule had tore his cruciate ligament in his knee earlier this month and has been ruled out for the remainder of the season.\n\nSome Italian clubs, like Roma, make medical statements concerning injuries to their players but refrain from going into detail.\n\nWhile in France, Paris Saint-Germain do make medical statements.", "description": "Gareth Bale is breaking new ground in Spain by leading the charge for players to have more protection regarding their medical information.", "authors": ["Jordan Seward For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/10/20275316-0-image-a-18_1572259796794.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
