(Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nKaela Davis couldn\u2019t win Saturday night in Dallas.\n\nShe was surrounded everywhere she turned. On defense, the 6-foot-2 swingwoman for the Dallas Wings was tasked with wrangling 6-4 Emma Meesseman, the forward who feels just as comfortable backing her way to the basket for a layup as she does stepping behind the arc to swish a three-pointer \u2014 which she did four times in four attempts.\n\nThe other end of the court offered no relief. There Davis had to contend with Elena Delle Donne, the 6-5 forward who worked with Washington Mystics assistant coach Eric Thibault all offseason to get better at defending smaller players. Davis\u2019s stats in the Mystics\u2019 91-85 win reflected nothing but strife: She had just two points, three rebounds and a minus-23 defensive rating.\n\nSuch is the struggle when Washington deploys its big lineup.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a mismatch that we try to exploit,\u201d Delle Donne said. \u201cNot only that, but Emma\u2019s a great shooter. She\u2019s super efficient, so we\u2019re able to spread the floor and kind of spread the defense out.\u201d\n\n[Stacey Abrams, Jerry Stackhouse highlight WNBPA\u2019s board of advocates]\n\nOn Saturday in Dallas, in a win that set the franchise record for wins in a season and secured Washington (23-8) a bye into the semifinal round of the WNBA playoffs, the Mystics had little choice but to go big.\n\nStarting guard Kristi Toliver (right knee bruise) missed her eighth consecutive game. Also out was her backup, Aerial Powers, who last week aggravated a left glute injury from earlier in the season. Toliver isn\u2019t expected back before the playoffs begin later this month, and Powers won\u2019t play in Washington\u2019s game Tuesday against the playoff-ineligible Liberty in New York, though she could play in the Mystics\u2019 final two games of the regular season this weekend.\n\n\u201cIf we were playing a playoff game, [Powers] could probably play [Tuesday],\u201d Washington Coach and General Manager Mike Thibault said Monday. \u201cBut we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d\n\nDown two high-scoring guards, the Mystics survived Saturday by going big. Washington usually starts just two bigs, but Saturday it started Meesseman, who has been coming off the bench, alongside Delle Donne, center LaToya Sanders, guard Ariel Atkins and point guard Natasha Cloud in a version of a big lineup that Washington has deployed in select moments throughout the season. A similar big lineup often includes playing Meesseman, Delle Donne and reserve forward Tianna Hawkins together in a trio of bigs who can shoot threes and wreak havoc on defenses.\n\nAgainst Dallas, Mike Thibault employed the big lineup longer than he has all season. It showed a way forward for the Mystics should the team run into more injury problems at guard, where Washington is particularly thin because top draft pick Kiara Leslie is sitting out her rookie season to recover from knee surgery.\n\nDelle Donne had 28 points Saturday, Meesseman had 19, and Sanders had 12. The Mystics shot 50.8 percent from the field and 45.5 percent on three-pointers, percentages that were even better through three quarters \u2014 60.8 percent from the field and 47.6 percent from three \u2014 before a slapdash fourth quarter that revealed some of the lineup\u2019s weaknesses.\n\nMore on that in a moment. For now, consider what it takes to make this big lineup work. Meesseman and Delle Donne are highly efficient shooters who could be plugged into just about any group and rake in points, but a truly successful big lineup that keeps its offensive efficiency and doesn\u2019t lag on defense requires adjustments on Delle Donne\u2019s part.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Mystics have been fine-tuning this lineup all season.\n\n\u201cThe main thing is getting a flow offensively because, if you\u2019re Elena, you\u2019re playing in a different spot on the floor for parts of it,\u201d Mike Thibault said. \u201cWhen she\u2019s in her normal starting lineup, she can play a lot more in the middle third of the floor and she doesn\u2019t play on the deep wings, whereas [Saturday], she did a little bit of both. That\u2019s finding a comfort zone to get her the ball in the right spots with that lineup.\u201d\n\n[Natasha Cloud, first-place Mystics handle the pressure with ease in rout of Sparks]\n\nThe big lineup also requires Delle Donne to be comfortable guarding smaller players such as Davis, the Wings\u2019 swingwoman. Most players as tall as Delle Donne aren\u2019t confident guarding smaller, faster players far out on the perimeter, but Delle Donne dedicated her offseason to learning how to do just that.\n\nShe spent hours each week watching film with Eric Thibault while she was rehabbing a left knee injury this winter, learning how to better anticipate the movement of those smaller players she would be defending. As a result, Delle Donne has improved her timing and learned to trust her movement on defense even more.\n\nBut as Saturday\u2019s eight-point fourth quarter demonstrated, Mike Thibault must be selective in deploying the big lineup; it\u2019s too dependent on mismatches. The Wings presented a perfect opportunity until they switched to a different lineup in the fourth quarter. With Powers out again Tuesday, Thibault said he hasn\u2019t decided if the Mystics will go big against New York or if they will depend on reserve guard Shatori Walker-Kimbrough and go with a smaller, more traditional group of starters.\n\nWalker-Kimbrough had 13 points off the bench Saturday and provides the added benefit of taking pressure off Cloud, the starting point guard who is playing through a host of nagging injuries.\n\nThe positive thing for Thibault is that moving forward, he probably won\u2019t have to depend on playing the big lineup for large swaths of time. When Powers returns, as Thibault is hopeful she will this weekend, the big lineup can go back to being more of a special deployment unit.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s nice to have a couple more weeks to work at it before we play in a playoff game, and it won\u2019t be a staple for us as far as huge minutes, but it will be a lineup that we can go to for five minutes a half, maybe,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming we have everybody back healthy \u2014 we did it before we got into this situation, before Kristi got hurt. It should only be a shorter-time lineup, something we do when we think we can force the game to be different for our opponents.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Mystics:\n\nMystics bounce back from \u2018ugly loss\u2019 with a dominant win over Liberty\n\nThe Mystics aim for a WNBA-playoff mentality with two regular season weeks to go", "description": "Washington beat Dallas, 91-85, on Saturday with Emma Meesseman, Elena Delle Donne and LaToya Sanders in the starting lineup.
