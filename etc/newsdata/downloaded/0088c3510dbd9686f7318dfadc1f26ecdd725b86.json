Here is a selection of his quotes:\n\n1.\n\n\u201cIn the future, voice connectivity will be in every room and almost every object: your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese.\u201d\n\n2.\n\n\u201cA future Alexa will pretend to take orders. But this Alexa will be watching you, clucking her tongue and stamping her foot.\u201d\n\n3.\n\n\u201cYou may keep secrets from your friends, from your parents, your children, your doctor \u2013 even your personal trainer \u2013 but it takes real effort to conceal your thoughts from Google.\u201d\n\n4.\n\n\u201cAI \u2013 what will it mean? Helpful robots washing and caring for an ageing population? Or pink-eyed terminators sent back from the future to cull the human race?\u201d\n\n5.\n\n\u201cWhat will synthetic biology stand for \u2013 restoring our livers and our eyes with miracle regeneration of the tissues, like some fantastic hangover cure? Or will it bring terrifying limbless chickens to our tables?\u201d\n\n6.\n\n\u201cWhen Prometheus brought fire to mankind. In a tube of fennel, as you may remember, that Zeus punished him by chaining him to a Tartarean crag while his liver was pecked out by an eagle. And every time his liver regrew the eagle came back and pecked it again. And this went on forever \u2013 a bit like the experience of Brexit in the UK, if some of our parliamentarians had their way.\u201d", "description": "PM uses his General Assembly speech on the challenges of technology to paint a dystopian view before returning to political crisis at home", "authors": ["Graham Russell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af74bd86f6f6b670116e391a258fe6092d7866f7/110_69_4040_2425/master/4040.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b4781365441370345097571510039f64", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
