Obama couldn\u2019t come close.\u201d\n\nTrump has been in the habit recently of taking on entertainment celebrities, especially for what he perceives as ingratitude and slights. A week ago he tweeted angrily at actress Debra Messing over her political views.\n\nChrissy Teigen, John Legend and President Trump.

The president was widely praised for what he called \u201ca great bi-partisan achievement for everybody.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cA man named @VanJones68, and many others, were profusely grateful (at that time!),\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI SIGNED IT INTO LAW, no one else did, & Republicans deserve much credit. But now that it is passed, people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise.\u201d\n\nVan Jones is a civil rights advocate and a former adviser to President Barack Obama for Obama\u2019s green jobs initiative.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets came hours after MSNBC aired a special town hall on criminal justice reform, hosted by Lester Holt and featuring Legend, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other reform advocates.\n\n\u201cGuys like boring musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2014 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,\u201d the president fumed. \u201c\u2018Anchor\u2019 @LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform. They only talk about the minor players, or people that had nothing to do with it.\u201d\n\nHowever, Holt did, in fact, give Trump credit during the \u201cDateline\u201d episode that preceded the town hall.\n\n\u201cThe people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed, all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump!\u201d Trump added in the third person.\n\nLegend and Teigen responded in tweets of their own.\n\nYour country needs you, Melania \u2014 John Legend (@johnlegend) September 9, 2019\n\nlol what a pussy ass bitch. tagged everyone but me. an honor, mister president. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 9, 2019\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump was up late on Sunday night, lashing out at the celebrity couple for not giving him enough credit on the bipartisan criminal justice bill he signed last year.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3vY7DliGJtSiZj6jQevgAg--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/7d239820-d306-11e9-95ea-d8cfcb158790", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
