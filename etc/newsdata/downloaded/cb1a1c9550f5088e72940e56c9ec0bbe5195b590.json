But Porter, an ardent Cleveland Browns fan, provides a different test. The buccaneering Akronite offers both danger and opportunity in a fight that could develop up close: ideal ingredients to add a thrilling element alongside his WBC belt and Spence Jr\u2019s IBF title.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great body puncher,\u201d Phil Lo Greco tells The Independent as one of just two fighters, with Brook, to share the ring with Spence Jr and Porter. \u201cHis body shots immediately caught my attention.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Not just throw body shots, like Joe Calzaghe, I\u2019m talking about a real digger here.\u201d\n\nGreat things have been expected of Spence Jr ever since reportedly bringing too much exuberance to a sparring session with Floyd Mayweather Jr.\n\nYet Porter finds himself in a familiar position as underdog, having scrapped his way to the top. The devout Christian is trained by his father Kenny, who once coached Spence Jr in the United States\u2019 Olympic set-up ahead of the 2012 Games. Despite never being friends, the pair have interacted over the years with Porter recently recalling the moment he became aware of Spence Jr\u2019s tenacity. It was not in the ring but at his pickup basketball game last year.\n\nPorter\u2019s pugilistic style has clearly irked Spence Jr though, presumably once he became aware he would be forced to take him out should he eventually acquire undisputed status. The simmering tension between the pair has now reached boiling point, with the bitterness perhaps luring Spence Jr away from the calculated, yet cautious display against Garcia in favour of pursuing a win on Saturday in \u201cdominating fashion\u201d, something that could favour Porter.\n\n\u201cHe is kind of dirty,\u201d Spence Jr claims. \u201cA lot of times he does like to fight dirty, especially if things don\u2019t go his way.\n\n\"All his fights are close decisions and split decisions - that's the only way he can stay close to the top-level fighters. You're an in-shape street fighter.\u201d\n\nDespite dismissing Porter publicly, Spence Jr is almost certainly preparing for his toughest test to date, one which may force him into demonstrating another unseen skill in the form of a back-foot game so rarely seen - or needed - in his 25-0 career to date.\n\nOnce both fighters have taken a close look at each other after that first bell, Porter will presumably set a tireless pace to challenge Spence Jr into matching one of his strongest qualities.\n\n\u201cHe was so hungry,\u201d Lo Greco recalls from their 2013 10-round bout. \u201cHe wanted it more than me. He throws a lot of punches, he\u2019s strong, but he does push a lot with his punches and wastes a lot of energy for no reason in my opinion.\n\n\u201cBut no, he\u2019s not a dirty fighter, he doesn\u2019t do it intentionally, it\u2019s just his style.\u201d\n\nLo Greco, who was stopped in three rounds by Spence Jr after accepting the fight on short notice, believes the favourite \u201cdominates\u201d the fight, notwithstanding any weight issues, with the tantalising prospect of future fights up to middleweight.\n\nAnd fellow champions Manny Pacquiao and Terence Crawford will watch on with intrigue, but for now Porter has vowed to force his rival into a long arduous night.\n\n\u201cThis fight is a mental war as much as it\u2019s a physical one,\u201d Porter adds. \u201cHe\u2019s young, technically savvy and tenacious. People say, \u2018he\u2019s the next coming.\u2019\n\n\u201cI have advantages that are flying under the radar. Guys can\u2019t handle my aggressive attack.\n\n\u201cHe didn't knock out 135lbs Mikey Garcia so he ain't knocking out 147lbs 'Showtime' Shawn Porter.
