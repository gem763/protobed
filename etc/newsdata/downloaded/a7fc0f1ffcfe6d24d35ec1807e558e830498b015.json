MORE from office.\n\n\n\nGraham raised the forthcoming letter during a closed-door caucus lunch on Wednesday, multiple sources told The Hill.\n\n\n\nThe letter, according to Graham\u2019s own description, would warn House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that Senate Republicans will not vote to remove President Trump from office because of a phone call where he asked the Ukrainian government to \u201clook into\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSen.(R-La.) told The Hill that he would sign the letter, if it is as described, but he warned it could be a distraction and, without enough support, could raise questions about GOP unity in the impeachment fight.\u201cI will sign the letter, but that doesn\u2019t mean I think it\u2019s necessarily a good idea,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need distractions right now.\u201d\n\nAsked if the letter would backfire if it doesn\u2019t get enough signatures, Kennedy acknowledged \u201cthat\u2019s a risk.\u201d He added some GOP senators want to hear more on impeachment and could be put in an awkward spot.\n\n\u201cThe fact that some senators may \u2026 not [sign the letter] does not indicate necessarily that they don't support the president. They just want to hear more \u2026 and I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair to them,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\n\u201cI just worry that Americans will look at it, and some less-enlightened members of the press \u2026 will look at it and say okay this is what the vote will be among the Republicans,\" he continued.\n\nKennedy was one of a handful of GOP senators who raised concerns about Graham\u2019s letter during the party\u2019s closed-door lunch. Some, including Sens.

Richard Shelby Richard Craig ShelbyMeet Trump's most trusted pollsters Contractors fight for pay from last shutdown \u2014 and the next one Trump signs stopgap measure, funding government through November MORE (R-Ala.) confirmed that Graham talked during the lunch about the letter. Shelby said he \u201casked him a couple questions.\u201d He declined to say what those questions were.\n\nA GOP senator panned the idea as \u201cone of the dumbest ideas I\u2019ve ever heard from Lindsey.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to help but it\u2019s going to backfire,\u201d the senator added. \u201cIf there aren\u2019t enough signatures the president is going to look really weak.\u201d\n\nAnother GOP senator said they were concerned the letter would shift the focus onto perceived splits within the Republican caucus, based on who did or did not sign the letter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no reason to begin to separate a conference that I think is very united on moving forward and doing our job in the right way,\u201d the senator added.\n\n\u201cI think you can read too much into the letter. You know some member that thinks, \u2018well I\u2019m a juror here and I don\u2019t want to say anything early.\u2019 ...I don\u2019t see what purpose it serves.\"\n\nGraham pitched the letter as part of a presentation he gave during the caucus lunch about what to expect from the impeachment process. Republicans view holding an impeachment trial as inevitable and Graham was one of the trial managers during the Clinton impeachment.\n\n\u201cGet ready for a rollercoaster,\u201d Graham said asked about how he described the likely impeachment trial during the lunch.\n\nGraham declined to say what type of reception his letter has gotten as he\u2019s been trying to garner signatures from his colleagues, and noted that he was \u201cjust speaking for myself.\u201d\n\nHe confirmed to The Hill that some raised concerns about the letter during the lunch and that he was taking their comments \u201cunder advisement.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people didn\u2019t like the approach and I\u2019m taking their concerns under advisement. And I\u2019ll do what I\u2019ll need to do,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked if it could put some of his colleagues up for reelection in battleground Senate races in an odd spot, he added: \u201cThe main thing for me is to try to be smart and stop a calamity from happening.\u201d\n\nSigning a letter guaranteeing that Senate Republicans won\u2019t impeach Trump could put his GOP colleagues in a tough position.\n\n\u201cIf Cory signs it he\u2019s dead, if Cory doesn\u2019t sign, he dead,\u201d the GOP senator said, referring to Sen.
