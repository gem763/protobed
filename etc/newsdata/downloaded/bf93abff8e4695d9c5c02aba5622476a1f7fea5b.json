Tired of hectic city life, he retired at 40, moved to Cabo Polonio and became one of its 120 permanent residents.\n\n\u201cBasically every 20 seconds at night, you can spot a meteor shooting across the sky,\u201d said Segalerba, press representative for Cabo Polonio at a promotional event held at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing.\n\nCabo, meaning \u201ccape\u201d in English, is a peninsula infamous for its rocky shores and fierce seas that wrecked many ships. Polonio, a Spanish ship, was just one of those misfortunes. It crashed into the peninsula on a stormy night in 1735, leaving its name as a legacy to the place where it was destroyed.\n\nDr. Leonardo Segalerba, press representative for Cabo Polonio National Park, makes a presentation at the \u201cThe Spanish in Your Suitcase\u201d event at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing on Aug 28, 2019.

The only way to get there is by taking a double-decker truck that routinely picks up tourists at a station and takes them on a 20-minute bumpy ride.\n\nElectricity, genesis of modern comfort and entertainment, isn\u2019t available. But it is worth noting the iconic lighthouse erected in 1881 by the Uruguayan government is powered by the national grid to prevent shipwrecks.\n\nMoreover, there is no running water in the area, and villagers there rely on water from wells and collected rain water.\n\nRecognized as a national park in 2009 by the Uruguayan government, Cabo Polonio embraces a mix of natural environments, such as beaches, sand dunes, and wetland. Meanwhile, the park is home to Uruguay\u2019s second-largest colony of sea lions, which number roughly 200,000.\n\nWith its breathtaking natural beauty and primitiveness, Cabo Polonio strikes visitors as the Shangri-La of South America. Since the 1980s, the site has been sought after by American and European tourists who desire to escape suffocating city life and reconnect with the freshness and tranquility of nature.\n\nDouble-decker trucks take tourists to Cabo Polonio, a hamlet on the eastern coast of Uruguay.

He spent more than 20 days during his recent trip to the village with his brother and sister-in-law, who were on their honeymoon.\n\nCalling Cabo Polonio his favorite place in the world, the well-traveled man opened a caf\u00e9 in Beijing\u2019s always buzzing and alcohol-laden Sanlitun in May and named it \u201cCabo Coffee\u201d, serving both excellent coffee and South Americans\u2019 favorite drink, the mate tea, a caffeine-rich infused drink.\n\nZhang Qi, owner of Cabo Coffee in Beijing\u2019s Sanlitun, makes a speech at the \u201cThe Spanish in Your Suitcase\u201d event at the Cervantes Institute in Beijing on Aug 28, 2019. [Photo by Yang Xiaoyu/chinadaily.com.cn]\n\n\u201cIn Cabo, I saw the biggest-ever setting sun, the most beautiful sunset, and the most spectacular galaxy of the southern hemisphere,\u201d Zhang fondly recalled, adding that \u201cThere is no electricity in Cabo, but it makes the place cooler and gives me a sense of primitiveness.\u201d\n\nLike Zhang\u2019s observation, Cabo Polonio is at its finest at night.\n\nAs the lighthouse is the sole artificial light after sunset, the region is free from light pollution, making it a vantage point in the Southern Hemisphere for appreciating thousands of stars punctuating the night sky.\n\nAnother night feast for the eye is watching the second-largest sea lion colony in Uruguay behind the iconic lighthouse, where the creatures can be seen singing and dancing.\n\nDuring the day, Cabo Polonio also has much fun to offer. Surfing, sunbathing on the beaches, running up and sliding down the sand dunes, or hiking along the shores are among the activities.\n\nA boy holding a fish net plays on the beach in Cabo Polonio, a hamlet on the eastern coast of Uruguay.

This has aroused the concern of many environmentalists, fearing swarms of tourists may pose a threat or even damage protected wildlife and the fragile ecosystem that the country values.\n\n\u201cThe isolation created by the surroundings prevents swarms of tourists from reaching Cabo, acting as a \u2018natural shield\u2019 that protects and preserves its culture and distinct way of life,\u201d Segalerba explained.\n\nSegalerba also pointed out that planning, analyzing and monitoring tourists\u2019 behavioral patterns can help achieve a fragile balance between environmental protection and the sustainable development of the area.\n\nIn addition, the authority in charge of the site will adopt measures such as managing tourist flow of the year and involving the local community in environmental protection to handle problems that may arise with the arrival of more and more international tourists.\n\nYang Xiaoyu contributed to the story\n\nCabo Coffee and a flower shop share the same venue, the Little White House in Beijing\u2019s Sanlitun.
