(TSXV:ITR ; OTCQX:IRRZF) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cIntegra\u201d) is pleased to announce that it has filed on SEDAR the independent NI 43-101 Technical Report (the \u201cReport\u201d) for the maiden Preliminary Economic Assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) for the DeLamar Gold-Silver Project located in southwest Idaho, USA.\n\nThe Report filed today contemplates a production scenario that outlines surface oxide and transitional mineralization at the Florida Mountain and DeLamar Deposits within an overall resource that can be processed by heap leaching. A further component of milling is anticipated to process mineralization from the unoxidized mineralization at Florida Mountain. The PEA was completed by Mine Development Associates (\u201cMDA\u201d) of Reno, NV, conducted under the direction of Timothy Arnold, Integra\u2019s Vice President of Project Development, and includes contributions from the consulting teams at McClelland Laboratories (Reno) (\u201cMcClelland\u201d), Woods Process Services (Denver) (\u201cWoods\u201d), Welsh Hagen (Reno) (\u201cWH\u201d) and EM Strategies (Reno) (\u201cEMS\u201d). The PEA Report is available on SEDAR under the Company\u2019s profile, and on the Company\u2019s website at:\n\nhttps://www.integraresources.com/site/assets/files/2572/pea_ni43-101delamarfloridamtn2019_oct_22_2019_final.pdf\n\nThe 2019 PEA, which includes resources from the Company\u2019s Updated Resource Estimate (please click the following link: https://integraresources.com/site/assets/files/2663/2019-06-17_nr_itr_t7hg7g9s.pdf ), demonstrates the robust economics of the project. Assuming a gold price of US$1,350 per ounce, and a discount rate of 5%, the DeLamar Project\u2019s estimated after-tax NPV is C$472.0 M and after-tax IRR is 43%. The payback period for DeLamar is 2.4 years after-tax. As is common, Project economics are sensitive to metal price assumptions, though remain very viable in the downside case and extremely robust in the upside case, as seen in Table 2 below and in the sensitivity analysis in the Report.\n\nEconomic and Operational Highlights\n\nTable 1.
