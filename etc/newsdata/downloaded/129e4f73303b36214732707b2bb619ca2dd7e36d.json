But when you\u2019re out chasing the feature on More Chilli until 11pm the night before getting absolutely obliterated in a cut-throat NRL Final, it doesn\u2019t exactly give off the best look. The optics on it tend to be real fucken bad, in fact.\n\nAs it turns out, several Brisbane Broncos players were spotted at a pub in inner-Sydney this past Saturday night. The reports go that despite the fact they were not canning on, they still hung around until about 11pm before shuffling off.\n\nThe issue there? The very next day they all half-heartedly trudged out to play an NRL Elimination Final where they got horribly, disgustingly belted by Parramatta to the tune of FIFTY EIGHT TO ZERO.\n\nReports from various sources assert that David Fifita, Matt Gillet, Andrew McCullough, Payne Haas, Corey Oates, Anthony Milford, Joe Ofahengaue, and Gehamat Shibasaki were all milling around Harpoon Harry in Surry Hills, playing pokies until around 11pm when the group moved on, except Fifita who reportedly hung around and kept playing.\n\nREAD MORE An NRL Fan Copped One Of The Most Unholy Falcons This Side Of Satan's Aviary\n\nWorse still, it appears that the group at the pub were there without notifying Broncos officials, having broken a team curfew and snuck out of their hotel.\n\nBRONCOS UPDATE: Brisbane hierarchy have confirmed several senior players broke camp to play pokies and have launched an investigation. Broncos will release a statement shortly. Players left the team hotel without the knowledge of coach Anthony Seibold \u2014 Pete Badel (@badel_cmail) September 17, 2019\n\nThe group in question were among the worst offenders in Brisbane\u2019s fairly effortless attempts at playing footy the next day, with Parramatta handing the club not only the biggest loss in NRL finals history, but the biggest loss in Broncos history full-stop.\n\nThe absolute scenes in all of this. Running a lobster or ten through a Queen of the Nile machine the night before getting pummelled so badly by the Parramatta Eels that it rewrites the history books.\n\nHonestly, if you were gonna put that little effort into things you might as well have sunk a schooner or two while you were at it.\n\nLord knows Broncos fans need a drink now.", "description": "At least 8 Brisbane Broncos players were reportedly spotted out at a Sydney pub playing the pokies the night before their ungodly 58-0 NRL Finals smashing.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/broncos.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
