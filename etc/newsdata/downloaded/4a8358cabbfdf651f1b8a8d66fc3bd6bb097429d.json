Bernard Sanders is drawing a distinction with Sen. Elizabeth Warren by quoting her statement that she considers herself a capitalist to her \u201cbones\u201d and saying that he does not.\n\n\u201cThe reason I am not is because I will not tolerate for one second the kind of greed, corruption, and income and wealth inequality and so much suffering that is going on in this country today which is unnecessary,\u201d the Vermont independent said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders also called Ms. Warren, a top rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, a longtime friend of his and a good senator.\n\nThe two candidates, who are vying for support from the far left, have generally declined to take direct shots at one another thus far in the Democratic presidential primary contest.\n\nBut Mr. Sanders said that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and doing things the old-fashioned way isn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cNow, what we need is in fact \u2014 I don\u2019t want to get people too nervous - we need a political revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cI am, I believe, the only candidate who\u2019s going to say to the ruling class of this country, the corporate elite, enough \u2026 with your greed and with your corruption - we need real change in this country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
