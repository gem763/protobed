It\u2019s not a very original or daring approach, but after the disappointment of Trine 3, which almost destroyed Finnish developer Frozenbyte, it\u2019s obvious why they went that route. And original or not there\u2019s no denying that Trine 4 is not only a much better game but probably the best in the series.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t played a Trine game before the set-up is relatively simple, in that it\u2019s a platform puzzler involving three different characters (a knight, thief, and wizard) who have to navigate through each level using their unique abilities. The original game, which is almost 10 years old now, was obviously influenced by The Lost Vikings, although there\u2019s little direct similarity now and Trine has always been more freeform and action-oriented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe big problem with Trine 3 was that instead of entirely 2D gameplay it moved into 3D for the first time, which didn\u2019t work that well in terms of the controls and also meant that Frozenbyte didn\u2019t have enough money to make the game as long as usual, and so it had an abrupt and unsatisfying ending that infuriated fans (and which is completely ignored by this new game). Thankfully, Frozenbyte did survive though and while Trine 4 may not necessarily point the way forward for the series it certainly atones for the earlier mistakes.\n\nThe comparisons to The Lost Vikings may be largely superficial but there is definitely a very old school feel to Trine in general, especially in the way it\u2019s built around solving real puzzles, rather than just flicking switches or doing what the onscreen prompts tell you. Many puzzles are physics-based and there\u2019s a lot of moving around heavy boxes and planks in order to get characters to inaccessible parts of the screen or smashing objects and using them as counterweights.\n\nEach character has a very different set of skills, with the wizard being the one that can levitate onscreen objects and create his own, which arguably makes him the most important of the trio. The thief has both a grappling hook and a bow and arrow, which can fire a variety of different ammo including fire and ice arrows. The knight only has a shield and sword, although the latter can be used to deflect things like fireballs and while there are enemies to be fought he\u2019s often still necessary for solving puzzles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the major appeals of Trine is the co-op, which allows someone to take control of a different character each. And while that certainly is a great way to play, if everyone knows what they\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not mandatory for getting the best out of the game. When playing on your own you simply switch between each character as necessary and to be honest probably get things done a lot more quickly than when you have to coordinate with others. Although the puzzles are slightly tweaked depending on how many people are playing.\n\nTrine 4 is not exactly a font of new ideas but its character progression system is much more advanced than any of the previous games. Characters have been upgradeable in the past but Trine 4 is able to introduce a constant stream of new abilities \u2013 from the thief being able to float objects in the air to the knight being able to break down walls \u2013 that ensure the puzzles never get stuck in a rut and instead enjoy an almost Nintendo-like frequency of new ideas on each new level.\n\nTrine 4 screenshot (PS4) \u2013 how are the graphics this good?!\n\nThere are also optional skills that can be unlocked as you progress, most of them related to combat \u2013 which is easily the weakest part of the game. It\u2019s not generally that important, and the infrequent pauses to wipe out a horde of nightmares never takes too long, but the boss battles are disappointingly poor. Not so much because they\u2019re a chore to get through (although some definitely are) but because they should\u2019ve represented the ideal way to mix together the puzzle and action elements of the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat definitely isn\u2019t a disappointment in Trine 4 is the graphics, which are astoundingly, surprisingly good, especially given the presumably modest budget of the game. The 2D gameplay must help simplify things to a degree but it frequently looks like your adventures are playing out across the pages of some extravagantly painted children\u2019s book, with wonderfully complex backgrounds and sumptuous use of lighting. It\u2019s not so obvious in screenshots, but when you\u2019re playing it really is one of the best-looking games of the year.\n\nThe most obvious fault with Trine 4 is that it is, by design, not very different from the first two games. While there\u2019s an understandable reason for the lack of progression, the fact is the series hasn\u2019t really moved forward much at all in the decade it\u2019s been around and the one entry that did try to switch things up was such a disaster it\u2019s the reason this one has been forced back to its roots.\n\nThat\u2019s clearly unfortunate but if this is your first time with the series, or you\u2019re already a fan, then it\u2019s not really going to matter. We don\u2019t know where Frozenbyte go from here, but if this ends up being the end of the Trine series that would be entirely reasonable as it\u2019s not only the best entry but also the longest and the most varied. It\u2019s certainly good to know things haven\u2019t ended on a sour note and the Trine 4 offers one of the prettiest, and most enjoyable, co-op experiences of the year.\n\nTrine 4: The Nightmare Prince review summary In Short: A welcome return to form for the series, and while the co-op puzzle-solving no longer seems quite as original as it once did it\u2019s never been as enjoyable or varied as this. Pros: Excellent range of puzzles, all of which offer plenty of freedom in how you solve them. Highly enjoyable in both co-op and on your own, with some stunningly attractive artwork. Cons: The combat is really not very interesting and the boss battle are actively bad. Few new ideas compared to the first two games.
