Trump insisted that he wanted to make sure the country was weeding out corruption before providing the funds.\n\nDemocrats insist that Trump was wrong to bring up a political opponent to a foreign leader, and even if he didn't explicitly make a demand, the innuendo was there. Democrats also took issue with the complaint's claim that Trump employed his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani in the matter.\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint named Giuliani and claimed diplomats were upset about by his role in pushing Kiev to open an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nAccording to the whistleblower complaint, by mid-May, U.S. diplomat Kurt Volker sought to \"contain the damage\" from Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine.\n\nBut a July 19 text message conversation from Volker to Giuliani, provided to Fox News on Thursday, showed that Volker had in fact encouraged Giuliani to reach out to Ukraine -- even sending Giuliani a message reading, \"connecting you here with Andrey Yermak, who is very close to President Zelensky.\"\n\nJoseph Maguire, acting director of national intelligence, said Thursday that, \"My only knowledge of what Mr. Giuliani does\u2014I have to be honest with you\u2014I get from the TV or the news media. I\u2019m not aware of what he does for the president.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has started an official inquiry into whether the House should pursue impeachment proceedings, but Democrats have refused to hold a roll call vote to authorize the effort.\n\n\"Impeaching a President means nullifying the results of a presidential election, which is the core act of American democratic legitimacy,\" The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page wrote on Friday. \"If Democrats are going to do this, they have an obligation to stand up and be counted in a way that the public can examine.\"\n\nTrump noted that the whistleblower had no first-hand knowledge of alleged abuse.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the person that gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days, when we were smart, right? The spies and treason? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times obtained and released a recording of the president\u2019s comments.\n\nThe Trump administration reportedly began placing transcripts of Trump's calls with several foreign leaders in a highly classified repository after leakers publicly divulged the contents of Trump's private calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia in 2017.\n\nThe complaint stated that Trump made a \u201cspecific request that the Ukrainian leader locate and turn over servers used by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and examined by the U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike\" -- a request that does not appear in the declassified transcript of the call released by the Trump administration on Tuesday. Trump mentioned CrowdStrike, but did not demand the server.\n\nAdditionally, the complaint said Trump \"suggested that Mr. Zelensky might want to keep\" his current prosecutor general, a claim not supported by the transcript.\n\nCBS News reported late Thursday that the whistleblower complaint further inaccurately claimed that a State Department official was on the call with Zelensky.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe memo was not a \"verbatim transcript\" but was based on \"notes and recollections\" of those memorializing the call.\n\nStephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said, \u201cNothing has changed with the release of this complaint.\u201d The president \u201chas nothing to hide.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "An unnamed Ukrainian official said that Kiev was not made aware that the U.S. suspended security funds until a month after President Trump's call with his counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, which calls\u00a0into question the whistleblower's account and Democrats' arguments\u00a0that there was a quid pro quo for the aid.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
