Photo: Bert Stern/Cond\u00e9 Nast via Getty Images\n\nAn effective but inexpensive mascara is hard to find. I would know \u2014 I\u2019ve tried everything on my very short, stubbornly straight Asian lashes, from cheap drugstore brands to the pricey high-end stuff, and it\u2019s rare that a mascara will do more than two things \u2014 some offer length but not volume, others give volume but not curling, and so on. It\u2019s why so many women I know take to a double-mascara maneuver, mixing two different brands on top of another. All I\u2019ve ever wanted was one no-frills mascara that can do it all.\n\nBased on a tip from a beauty editor friend (who\u2019s used the mascara on her own Asian lashes), I now use a mascara that checks all the mascara boxes \u2014 for less than $5. The Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara from Essence, true to its name, dramatically plumps and intensifies my lashes in every single way \u2014 it lengthens, volumizes, lifts, and curls each tiny hair (without the use of a tool) \u2014 to the point where my eyes look more open, brighter, and more alert.\n\nEssence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara Because I have sparse, stubby lashes to begin with, the mascara takes a few strokes to get into \u201cfalse lash\u201d territory, but it will likely enhance more well-endowed lashes with just a stroke or two. I\u2019ve recommended Essence\u2019s mascara to almost everyone I know (Asians and non-Asians alike), and the results are staggering. Those who\u2019ve fallen under its cult spell post stunning before and after photos on Reddit (seriously, look at those photos). Recently, at a family engagement party, my own father asked if I had gone in for eyelash extensions. I\u2019ve never been more flattered. Some reviewers complain that the mascara is a pain to remove, but I consider that one of the mascara\u2019s best qualities \u2014 it\u2019s an all-day, long-lasting product that doesn\u2019t require constant upkeep. Though not touted as waterproof, it\u2019s even survived sweaty yoga sessions and barre classes smudge-free. When I\u2019m ready to take it off, I simply wash my eye area carefully with a soapy cleanser (I like this Shiseido) and then swipe it with Bioderma micellar water to pick up any lingering residue. $5 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nMore Strat-approved eye-openers\n\nChanel Inimitable Waterproof Mascara If you\u2019re looking for the very best waterproof mascara, several agree that it\u2019s Chanel\u2019s. None other than Kim Kardashian\u2019s makeup artist says Chanel Inimitable Waterproof Mascara is the best because it\u2019s \u201cwaterproof but also curls, lengthens, and gives volume in just one coat. A lot of waterproof-mascara formulas tend to be drying, but this one feels soft and is conditioning.\u201d $32 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
