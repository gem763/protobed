My love bug. My best friend. My constant. My soul mate. My everything. I brought him home when he was 9 weeks old on a rainy day in New York City. Ten years later on a rainy day in LA, he passed away in my arms on my bedroom floor.\"\n\nShe explained that after heart issues, a heart attack was always a possibility.\n\n\"He just had too much love and heart for his physical body. It all happened so fast, but I held him as he took his last breath, and I was able to tell him I loved him the very most. I told him everyday I loved him more than anything in the world, and I reminded him of that over and over,\" she continued.\n\nSo many supported the owner in the comments section for the post, including other famous dogs.\n\n\"I love u forever Bruley. I'm so sorry,\" Doug the pug wrote, while Pickle the Pig added, \"I am so sad. I loved Bru so much! He will be missed!!!!!
