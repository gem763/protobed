But we do, our ideas are better than theirs, and we\u2019re not going anywhere.\n\nThere is no easier way to make the left mad than being a gay Republican. This time, it\u2019s the Stonewall Democratic Club that\u2019s up in arms.\n\nStonewall is a group of LGBT Democrats who purport to champion \u201cequality for all.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t know this from their record.\n\nBill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell (DADT) during his first term. These acts outlawed gay marriage and military service for openly LGBT soldiers, respectively. It took 20 years to undo that codified discrimination. But Stonewall endorsed Clinton for reelection in 1996 anyway.\n\nBarack Obama ran for president in 2008 opposing gay marriage. Stonewall endorsed him nonetheless. From 2008 to 2010, although Democrats controlled both the White House and Congress, Obama did nothing to advance LGBT equality. Stonewall endorsed him again in 2012.\n\nRecently, the Stonewall Democrats of San Antonio terrorized a Hispanic gay Republican running for Congress in Texas, threatening \u201ceconomic sanctions\u201d against the gay nightclub he owns unless he leaves the race.\n\nDespite this shameful history, Stonewall\u2019s Ryan Basham recently wrote an article condemning the Log Cabin Republicans for endorsing Donald Trump. We at Log Cabin represent LGBT conservatives and allies. Our endorsement is the latest addition to a record that is actually far superior to Stonewall\u2019s.\n\nLog Cabin\u2019s Better Record on Gay Issues\n\nWhile Stonewall was cheerleading Obama\u2019s do-nothing Democrats, Log Cabin sued the government to kill DADT. In 2010, Log Cabin won an injunction preventing the administration from enforcing DADT. Only after fighting that injunction, and losing, did Obama finally repeal the law.\n\nLog Cabin has also withheld its endorsement from high-profile Republican candidates who opposed marriage equality \u2014 unlike Stonewall, we resist partisan groupthink, even when it costs us. We wouldn\u2019t be endorsing President Trump in 2020 if he weren\u2019t truly an ally.\n\nTrump openly supported LGBT equality before any of Stonewall\u2019s endorsees did. In 1999, while Democrats defended DADT, Trump opined that gays and lesbians serving openly was \u201cnot something that would disturb me.\u201d In 2000, Trump proposed an amendment of civil rights law to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, which would have rendered moot the employment discrimination case currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 2015, though Trump needed religious conservative votes to win the Republican primary, he nevertheless stated publicly that religious freedom and LGBT rights are not \u201cmutually exclusive.\u201d He even rebuked his running mate-to-be, Mike Pence, for initially undervaluing LGBT interests in Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act, on which Pence ultimately reversed. Today, President Trump still has our back.\n\nStonewall Incorrectly Attacks President Trump\n\nStonewall\u2019s article censures Russia for orchestrating \u201can industrial-scale genocide of gay men\u201d in Chechnya. Russia\u2019s behavior is indeed alarming. So President Trump, collaborating with his (gay) Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, has launched a historic initiative to decriminalize homosexuality worldwide. Basham conveniently omits this fact. (Incidentally, our Los Angeles chapter dedicated Pride Month in 2018 to raising awareness and money for Rainbow Railroad, a nonprofit that rescues gay men from Chechnya. Stonewall used its Pride booth that year to promote itself.)\n\nStonewall calls Trump\u2019s plan to reduce HIV/AIDS transmission by 90 percent within 10 years \u201clip service\u201d because HIV+ immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border are separated from other immigrants. But this policy is intended to provide HIV+ immigrants, some of whom face untreated AIDS, with needed medical care. Stonewall also neglects to mention that Trump\u2019s budget included $291 million to fight HIV in 2020 alone. Trump also convinced the antiviral research group Gilead to donate billions of dollars of HIV prevention medication for 200,000 people. That is hardly lip service.\n\nStonewall further insinuates, ludicrously, that Trump is bigoted for halting Obama-era attempts to tell public schools which bathroom transgender students can use. We say, good: The well-being of children who do not identify with their biological sex is vitally important, but it does not fall under the originally intended purview of Title IX and would thus be better explored at the state and local level without federal intervention. Executive overreach in the name of LGBT rights does nothing to recommend our cause.\n\nNor is attacking religious freedom, as Basham does, a good look for gays. We will get nowhere by forcing religious people to bake cakes for our weddings. The majority of LGBT people are religious themselves \u2014 Log Cabin therefore supports the First Amendment because religious rights are LGBT rights.\n\nMany Trump Supporters Are LGBT\n\nSo Stonewall is wrong. But something more important is going on here. What really infuriates Basham is that Log Cabin has \u201cgiven cover\u201d for the president\u2019s claim that \u201csome of [his] biggest supporters\u201d are LGBT. As if saying so were a crime Trump commits in secrecy while his fabulous gay accomplices at Log Cabin run interference. But it\u2019s just a fact: Many of Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters are LGBT people.\n\nLeft-wing gay activists, however, depend on creating the impression that all LGBT people are Democrats. Democrats then use this false narrative to consolidate unearned moral authority. That is why, when the prominent gay billionaire Peter Thiel expressed support for Trump, The Advocate promptly ran a piece arguing he isn\u2019t actually gay \u2014 he just has sex with men. (Really. They did that. Look it up.)\n\nThe point of such chicanery is to insinuate that all Republicans are homophobes, and all homophobes are Republicans. That only works if Democrats speak for all gays. So just one prominent gay or trans Republican punctures the lie that the left has a monopoly on gay rights.\n\nLog Cabin Republicans stand to disabuse the public of that lie.
