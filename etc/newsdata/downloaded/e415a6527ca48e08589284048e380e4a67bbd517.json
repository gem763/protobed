Previous such deals had much lower compliance \u2013 initially around 60 percent for one in 2009.\n\nAnother 11 non-OPEC producers signed on to the deal, including Russia and Kazakhstan, and are estimated to have delivered about half of the cuts they pledged.\n\nThe International Energy Agency, which advises industrial nations on energy policy, was the main sources of the information. It said: \u201cSome producers, notably Saudi Arabia, (are) appearing to cut by more than required.\u201d\n\nThe IEA also raised its global oil demand growth expectations for this year to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), up 100,000 bpd from its previous estimate.\n\nHigher price helps US shale producers\n\nWhile the deal has boosted oil prices, that makes it more profitable for US shale oil producers to increase production. Capital Economics analysts said in a note: \u201cWe think US production is likely to rebound.\u201d\n\nUS energy companies have been adding oil rigs and redeploying cash and workers, cautiously confident the energy sector has turned a corner, with crude prices holding above $50 a barrel since early December.\n\nQatar\u2019s energy minister recently said but the global oil market can accommodate higher shale oil production.\n\nMohammed al-Sada told Reuters: \u201cWith that continuous demand increase I think all available oils are going to be accommodated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith the current price some fields can be developed profitably though the majority of fields today will not be satisfied with this current price and will not be able to justify further development in high-cost oil fields, especially deep-water and unconventional fields,\u201d he added.", "description": "Oil prices jump on word that OPEC producers have achieved over 90 percent of the output cuts they had pledged.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/357561/1000x563_357561.jpg", "published_at": "2017-02-10"}
