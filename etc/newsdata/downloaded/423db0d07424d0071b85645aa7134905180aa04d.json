He\u2019s class and he helps me so much. He\u2019s got a lot of time for me. He\u2019s a top guy and it\u2019s good to speak to him.\n\n\u201cI will get my clips together after a game, send them to Rio and he\u2019ll come back and say: \u2018to be honest, I\u2019d have done this or this\u2026\u2019 or tell me what I\u2019ve done well.\n\n\"I\u2019m always trying to learn and improve and there\u2019s no-one better to give me advice.\u201d\n\n(Image: Steve Reigate)\n\nIt is easy to understand why because there are similarities because Godfrey likes to be seen as a ball-playing centre half.\n\nHe started life like every kid wanting to be a striker, moved back into midfield and only really came into his own as a defender just over a year ago.\n\nGodfrey comes from York, grew up in a family obsessed by rugby league - his dad Alex played for Hull Kingston Rovers - and went through the lower divisions before a year on loan at Shrewsbury finally got him ready for Norwich.\n\nLast season was an incredible joyride to promotion from the Championship and manager Daniel Farke and sporting director Stuart Webber were determined not to abandon the players who got them into the promised land.\n\nGodfrey said: \u201cIt\u2019s been the best year of my life. When the final whistle went against Blackburn last season and we\u2019d won promotion, you knew the next thing you\u2019d be doing was playing in the Premier League and it felt so good.\n\n\u201cYou can go up in the Premier League, spend a ridiculous amount of money and still get relegated. You may as well go young, hungry, almost naive in a sense, but that means you don\u2019t have any fear. I believe young and hungry is the way forward.\n\n\u201cWe really believe we will stay up. 100 per cent. It\u2019s such a mad league, there\u2019s such a long way to go and that\u2019s why we like it because it can mess with your head and one minute you\u2019re losing, the next you are on a winning run.\n\n\"But we\u2019re very confident we can stay up.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThat unshakeable belief will come in useful in the next few weeks.\n\nAfter the incredible high of beating Manchester City at Carrow Road, came three back-to-back defeats with a 5-1 thrashing at home by Aston Villa before the international break.\n\nGodfrey himself has spent the last two weeks undergoing surgery rather than joining up on England under-21 duty.\n\nBut, incredibly, he is already back in full training and ready to play on Saturday.\n\n(Image: Steve Reigate)\n\nHe said: \u201cI had a little operation, was gutted to miss the England games but I had to get it sorted because it had been inhibiting.\n\n\"I went to Germany for it, Dr. Ulrike Muschaweck, she\u2019s well known and I knew I was in good hands. They\u2019ve done everything to get me back for this weekend.\n\n\u201cBeing made under-21s captain was such an honour.\n\n\"Getting called up to the squad was big, it was nice to have Max (Aarons) and Toddy (Cantwell) as well, then being made captain was nice, it\u2019s a massive achievement and I couldn\u2019t wait to tell my family.\n\n\u201cI do see myself as a leader. I don\u2019t know why.\n\n\"I enjoy being captain of the team and, with or without the armband, I\u2019d be the same but it\u2019s such a good feeling to lead out your country.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: England U21 captain Godfrey is vital to the Canaries hopes and refuses to shirk any responsibility at Carrow Road", "authors": ["John Cross", "Image", "Steve Reigate", "Mirrorpix", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647164.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_NORWICH-CITY-DEFENDER-BEN-GODFREY-PICTURE-BY-STEVE-REIGATE-16102019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
