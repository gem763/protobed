Take a look at what happened to Gaddafi. He's using that to make a deal with North Korea. And I don't blame Kim Jong Un for what he said after that. He wanted nothing to do with John Bolton. That's not a question of being tough. That's a question for being not smart for saying something like that.\"\n\nOliver Contreras/The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nBolton was conspicuously absent from Trump's last meeting with Kim Jong Un. While Trump was meeting with an adversary about one of world\u2019s biggest national security issues, Bolton was in Mongolia for what he said was a previously scheduled meeting.\n\nBolton, a foreign policy hawk who has served in previous Republican administrations, offered his letter of resignation to Trump following a weekend where the president abruptly canceled peace talks with the Taliban at Camp David. Bolton split with the president on his decision to negotiate with the militant group, among other foreign policy positions. Bolton served as the president\u2019s third national security adviser, after Gen. Michael Flynn and H.R. McMaster.\n\nOn Tuesday, the president and Bolton were at odds about how exactly Bolton\u2019s decision to leave was made. Trump said he requested Bolton\u2019s resignation while Bolton maintained that he offered his resignation.\n\n\u201cWe actually got along very well. I'm sure he'll, you know, do whatever he can do to, you know, spin it his way. John came to see me the night before,\u201d Trump said gesturing to a chair in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cAnd he sat right in that chair and I told him, \"John, you have too many people, and you're not getting along with people. And a lot of us, including me, disagree with some of your tactics and some of your ideas. And I wish you well, but I'd like you to submit your resignation.\" And he did that.\u201d\n\nTwo of Bolton\u2019s closest aides, spokesperson Garrett Marquis and Sarah Tinsley, are also leaving the administration.\n\n\"It was an honor to serve my country, and I wish the President and the Administration success moving forward,\" Marquis said in a statement.\n\nThe president said he currently has five people under consideration for Bolton's replacement, including the State Department\u2019s special envoy for Iran Brian Hook, national security adviser to Vice President Pence, Keith Kellogg, and Rick Waddell, who previously served under McMaster on the National Security Council. He said he will make an announcement next week. In the meantime, Charlie Kupperman, who served as deputy under Bolton, is serving as acting national security adviser.\n\nBut one expert says that no matter whom the president picks, the most important voice is Trump\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThe most influential person in the Trump administration and foreign policy is Trump,\u201d Tom Wright a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution told ABC News. \u201cIt's not that one set of advisers or another set of advisers are able to manipulate him. I think the longer he's in the job, the more he wants to be true to his own instincts.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump says he split with", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/trump-bolton-gty-jc-190911_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
