If this is happening to you, you might have to go through a few different troubleshooting options.\n\nBelow are some reasons why this might be happening, and some solutions to fix the issue.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to make sure your iPhone won't go straight to voicemail\n\nTurn off Do Not Disturb mode\n\nWhen your iPhone is in Do Not Disturb mode, any call you receive will go straight to voicemail, and you won't be alerted when you receive notifications.\n\nYou might not have enabled Do Not Disturb mode on your iPhone intentionally, but if your device is going straight to voicemail, it's worth making sure that you didn't accidentally turn it on.\n\nYou can check this in two different ways.\n\nTo disable \"Do Not Disturb\" via the Control Center:\n\n1. Open the Control Center on your iPhone. To do this, swipe your finger up from the bottom of your iPhone's screen (or from the upper-right corner on an iPhone X or newer).\n\n2. Look for the icon that looks like a crescent moon \u2014 this is the Do Not Disturb icon.\n\n3. The icon should be grayed out, but if it's illuminated white, this means that you have Do Not Disturb on.\n\nIf the Do Not Disturb icon is lit up, it's activated. Jennifer Still/Business Insider\n\n4. Tap the icon so the white is replaced by gray, and you've turned Do Not Disturb off.\n\nYou can also check to see if \"Do Not Disturb\" is enabled through the Settings app.\n\n1. Tap the Settings app icon on your iPhone's home screen.\n\n2. Scroll down to the \"Do Not Disturb\" option, and tap to open it.\n\n3. Tap the switch at the top of the page so it turns gray.\n\nMake sure the switch at the top of the Do Not Disturb page is grayed out. Jennifer Still/Business Insider\n\nOn this page, you can also see how Do Not Disturb may have turned on in the first place. Make sure that you don't have the mode scheduled, and that it isn't set to turn on automatically when you're driving.\n\nFor more information on how Do Not Disturb works, see our article, \"How to use Do Not Disturb on iPhone manually, or schedule it to activate at a specific time each day.\"\n\nCheck your iPhone's volume\n\nWhile your iPhone's volume being muted won't keep calls from coming through, it does make it harder to hear calls when you receive them.\n\nTo make sure you hear all your calls:\n\n1. Open the Settings app and tap on \"Sounds & Haptics.\"\n\n2. Adjust the slider beneath the \"Ringer and Alerts\" header to your desired volume \u2014 as you slide your finger along, the phone will play a short sound showing how loud the ringer will be.\n\nMake sure that your iPhone's ringer isn't muted. Jennifer Still/Business Insider\n\nIf you've perhaps turned off your volume because you're receiving too many calls from spammers, check out our article, \"How to stop robocalls and other spam calls from reaching your iPhone.\"\n\nRestart your iPhone\n\nIf you can't find anything in your settings that would send a call straight to voicemail, your iPhone might simply need to be refreshed. You should try restarting it to work out the kinks.\n\nTo learn how to restart any iPhone model, check out our article, \"How to restart and force-restart any iPhone model.\"\n\nMake sure your iPhone is updated\n\nAgain, while running an outdated version of iOS doesn't necessarily mean you'll experience this problem, Apple advises that whenever you're having trouble with your device, you should make sure you're fully updated.\n\nTo check this that you're updated:\n\n1. Open your Settings app.\n\n2. Tap the \"General\" tab.\n\n3. Tap \"Software Update.\"\n\nIf a new version of iOS is available, you'll be prompted to download and install it here.\n\nThe Software Update page will tell you if there's an update waiting to be installed. Jennifer Still/Business Insider\n\nCheck with your service provider\n\nIf none of the above methods work, it's worth checking in with your cell service provider to see if they're experiencing any system-wide issues.\n\nIf they are, that might explain why your calls are being sent straight to voicemail. If there aren't any problems, it might be time to contact Apple for further support.", "description": "Your iPhone might go straight to voicemail on incoming calls for a number of reasons, including your Do Not Disturb settings or several other issues.", "authors": ["Jennifer Still"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9b676749e03f351635c807?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
