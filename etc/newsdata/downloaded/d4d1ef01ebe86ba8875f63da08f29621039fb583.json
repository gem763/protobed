California-based Oska Wellness uses what it calls Pulsed Electromagnetic Field (PEMF) technology in its Oska Pulse wearable device, and the company raised over $5 million in early stage funding this past June to help scale the business. And digital therapeutics startup Kaia Health raked in $10 million earlier this year for an app-based approach to physiotherapy for musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, which often comes with chronic pain.\n\nAnd providers and startups alike are exploring virtual reality (VR) therapies for pain relief. A recent study from Cedars-Sinai illustrated the potential for VR to manage pain levels of their patients \u2014 as patients who were provided with on-demand, bedside access to relaxing VR experiences reported statistically significant decreases in their pain levels compared with the control group. And researchers from the University of Phoenix found that 77% of patients who engaged with VR experiences during labor reported that it helped them manage their pain.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
