Following the 1959 Cuban communist revolution, the Castro regime stole the airport along with all other companies and private enterprises.\n\n\u201cFor his efforts, Vilaboy, like so many other Cubans, was left with nothing when Fidel Castro took power and established a communist government, which stole his property and forced him and his family to flee Cuba,\u201d the lawsuit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit goes on to accuse the two airlines of using the airport facilities without receiving his authorization or providing any compensation, and thus had engaged in \u201cunlawful trafficking of his confiscated property in Cuba\u201d in violation of Title III of the Helms-Burton Act.\n\nSigned by President Bill Clinton in 1995, Title III of the Helms-Burton Act allows U.S. citizens with claims to confiscated property in Cuba to file suit in U.S. courts against persons believed to be \u201ctrafficking\u201d in that property.\n\nAll presidents since the law passed used an executive waiver to prevent it from going into action. President Donald Trump made history by allowing Title III to actively become law.\n\nIn a statement to the Miami Herald, American Airlines said it had received authorization from various government agencies to fly to the airport. \u201cTitle III specifically exempts lawful travel, which is what American provides,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe\u2019ll review this lawsuit in detail and vigorously defend our service to Cuba.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez Regueiro told the outlet that he remained entitled to compensation after a Florida court recently declared him his father\u2019s legitimate and only heir: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of justice. They took everything from my father and didn\u2019t compensate anyone.\u201d\n\nThe Cuban regime claims that Regueiro\u2019s father obtained the airport, as well as other valuable assets such as hotels and newspapers, after gaining illicit loans from the Batista regime.\n\n\u201cFor the Cuban government, either you are with the government, or you are bad,\u201d Regueiro contended. \u201cFor the [Castro] government, nobody owned property legitimately.\u201d\n\nAmerican Airlines is just the latest in a long list of companies accused of property trafficking. So far, over a dozen lawsuits have been filed against Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Expedia, Booking.com, Meli\u00e1, and Credit Suisse. None of those cases have yet reached a verdict.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com", "description": "The Cuban exile who remains the rightful owner of an airport in Havana filed a federal lawsuit against American Airlines on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Regueiro-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
