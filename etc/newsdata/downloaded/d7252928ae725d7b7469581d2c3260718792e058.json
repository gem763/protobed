The transgressor should (4) be part of the group doing the shaming. And the shaming should (5) come from a respected source, (6) be directed where possible benefits are highest, and (7) be implemented conscientiously.\u201d\n\nObesity fits the bill of transgression. Every American is implicated in skyrocketing healthcare costs, regardless of how healthy or unhealthy; the premiums of the fit increase due to costs of avoidable treatments for obesity. Obesity deviates wildly from natural biological behavior; the photo from fifties Maher points to is evidence of how quickly Americans have grown. Of course, there should be no formal punishment, yet that doesn\u2019t imply that we remain silent.", "description": "", "authors": ["Derek Beres", "Bigthink.Com Surprising-Science Obesity-Leading-Cause-Death-America-Shame"], "top_image": ""}
