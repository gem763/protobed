It's not hard to figure out why.\n\nScheer's message during this campaign was simple and stinging: You can't trust Justin Trudeau. But in earnest, he has also had a hard time convincing voters they can trust him.\n\nFor one thing, Scheer campaigned as an average Canadian guy. Until it turned out that he is also American.

Although unapologetically pro-life, he is adamant that he will do nothing to change pro-choice laws in Canada. Although unwilling to declare support for gay marriage, he says he won't try to change that law either.\n\nHis extreme pragmatism can also leave a confusing message \u2014 his backing of the new US, Canada, Mexico trade agreement offers a good example: \"It's quite clear that Justin Trudeau did cave to Donald Trump,\" says Scheer during a campaign press conference in an attempt to swipe at the trade deal, but then repeated that he would approve the deal anyway if elected prime minister.\n\nKeep reading here.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party wins election after he apologized for wearing blackface during a school event nearly two decades ago.
