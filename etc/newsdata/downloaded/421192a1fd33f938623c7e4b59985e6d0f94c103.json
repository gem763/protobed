In the official trailer for The Crown\u2019s third season, our dear sovereign (Olivia Colman, who took over the royal reins from Claire Foy) is reassessing her life thanks to her impending silver-jubilee celebration, which is being made increasingly difficult what with Britain \u201cfalling apart\u201d all around her. More specifically: The country is bankrupt, national security is in tatters, Prince Philip (Tobias Menzies) is being a moody daddy, and Prince Charles (Josh O\u2019Connor) is going through puberty. Ugh! \u201cWe\u2019ve all made sacrifices and suppressed who we are,\u201d Elizabeth ominously narrates. \u201cIt\u2019s not a choice, it\u2019s a duty.\u201d The ten-episode season premieres on Netflix, in full, on November 17. Helena Bonham Carter, Ben Daniels, and Emerald Fennell also star.\n\nRelated", "description": "Netflix debuted the trailer for The Crown\u2019s third season, which stars Olivia Colman as a middle-aged Queen Elizabeth.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/21/21-the-crown.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
