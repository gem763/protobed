Sullivan , a landmark ruling that supported freedom of the press.\n\nHe was 89 when he died Oct. 24 at his home in Baltimore. The cause was complications from congestive heart failure, said his wife, Bettina Jenkins.\n\nA tall, courtly Southerner, Carrell Ray Jenkins was born in Sylvester, Ga., on Sept. 25, 1930. His mother was a homemaker, and his father sold tractors for International Harvester while growing cotton, corn and tobacco on the family farm.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Jenkins seemed destined for an agricultural career himself before coming down with tuberculosis as a boy, leading doctors to fuse the bones in his left knee. While continuing with his daily chores \u2014 wringing the necks of chickens, castrating pigs with a dull knife \u2014 he also plowed through a set of Charles Dickens novels and focused on writing, encouraged by a teacher.\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Elijah Cummings, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image John Conyers Jr. | John Conyers Jr., who became the longest-serving African American in Congress, co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus and helped create a national holiday in the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. but whose career rapidly crumbled at 88 when he resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, died Oct. 27 at his home in Detroit. He was 90. Read the obituary (Andrew Harnik/For The Washington Post)\n\nHe became the first in his family to graduate from college, receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism from the University of Georgia in 1951, and joined Georgia\u2019s Columbus Ledger newspaper that same year. Mr. Jenkins was assigned to what was then considered \u201cthe dog beat of the paper\u201d \u2014 covering Phenix City, Ala., where GIs from nearby Fort Benning flocked to gambling halls and brothels such as Ma Beachie\u2019s Swing Club and Cliff\u2019s Fish Camp.\n\n\u201cBeing young and single,\u201d he later wrote, \u201cI had a singular advantage over the other reporters: I participated in the vice by night and I exposed it by day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Jenkins was beaten while covering a 1952 municipal election. Two years later he found himself in the middle of one of the country\u2019s hottest stories, when Albert L. Patterson, the Democratic nominee for Alabama attorney general, was assassinated in Phenix City after promising to crack down on corruption.\n\nAD\n\nThe state government brought in the National Guard, and 144 people were prosecuted in connection with the city\u2019s politically connected underworld. More than 80 were convicted or pleaded guilty. And in a twist of fate that inspired a Hollywood film, \u201cThe Phenix City Story,\u201d Patterson\u2019s son, John, was elected attorney general in his place and later became governor.\n\nMr. Jenkins covered the story alongside Ledger colleagues such as Tom Sellers and editor Robert W. Brown, who wrote front-page editorials. In 1955, the Ledger and its Sunday edition, the Ledger-Enquirer, were awarded the Pulitzer for public service, a top honor in American journalism that is given to a publication rather than to individual reporters.\n\nAD\n\nThe judges wrote that the newspaper\u2019s \u201ccomplete news coverage and fearless editorial attack . . . were effective in destroying a corrupt and racket-ridden city government,\u201d adding that \u201cit covered the whole unfolding story of the final prosecution of the wrong-doers with skill, perception, force and courage.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Jenkins was only 24 when the Pulitzer was awarded. He went on to write about the black community in Columbus, which was generally ignored by the newspaper, before being named city editor of the Alabama Journal in 1959. Within a year, he would write his 12-inch story on the King ad, which he spotted while eating a bologna sandwich, examining a tattered copy of the New York Times that had been passed among the Journal\u2019s editors.\n\nHis article prompted an outraged editorial from the Montgomery Advertiser, which pounced on the inaccuracies in the ad to call for the Times and the advertisement\u2019s backers to determine whether their names were \u201cmarried to a slanderous lie.\u201d Soon after, Montgomery police commissioner L.B. Sullivan demanded a retraction and sued the Times, alleging libel.\n\nAD\n\nOther politicians (including Gov. Patterson) sued as well, and the case landed in the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously for the Times and restricted public officials\u2019 ability to sue for defamation, establishing the standard of \u201cactual malice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMr. Jenkins, meanwhile, rose to become the Journal\u2019s managing editor and then editorial-page editor, a position that he also held at the morning Advertiser before being named executive editor of both newspapers in 1978.\n\nHe edited a Pulitzer-winning 1970 series by Harold Eugene Martin about the use of Alabama prisoners for pharmaceutical experiments and once estimated that he cost the Advertiser and Journal $500,000 in revenue for running liberal editorials opposing Wallace, the segregationist Alabama governor.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound pretentious, but the editorial page ought to be the repository of the conscience of the community,\u201d Mr. Jenkins later told the Evening Sun.\n\nHe joined the newspaper in 1981, after working in the Carter administration as a special assistant for press affairs \u2014 a position that later led him to joke, \u201cThe White House is a good place to have been, not to be.\u201d Under Mr. Jenkins, the editorial and op-ed pages of the Evening Sun \u201cimproved dramatically,\u201d Publisher Michael J. Davies said in 1991, when Mr. Jenkins announced his retirement. The Evening Sun, an afternoon sister paper of the Baltimore Sun, folded three years later.\n\nAD\n\nIn retirement, Mr. Jenkins wrote occasional op-eds and a book, \u201cBlind Vengeance\u201d (1995), on the 1989 bombing campaign of Walter Leroy Moody Jr., who murdered federal judge Robert S. Vance and civil rights lawyer Robert E. Robinson. (Moody was sentenced to death and executed last year at 83, becoming the oldest inmate put to death in the modern era of capital punishment.)\n\nAD\n\nMr. Jenkins\u2019s account of the bombings drew on a legal training he pursued in the years after covering the Phenix City trials, taking night classes at the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law, now part of Faulkner University in Montgomery. He received a law degree in 1977 and was also a Nieman journalism fellow at Harvard University. In 1985, he won the Scripps Howard Foundation\u2019s Ernie Pyle Award for human-interest reporting.\n\nIn addition to his wife of 63 years, the former Bettina Cirsovius, a German immigrant who lives in Baltimore, survivors include three children, Sam Jenkins of Memphis, Mark Jenkins of Montgomery and Nancy Jenkins-Chafin of Richmond; and four grandchildren.\n\nAD\n\nWhile Mr. Jenkins\u2019s editorials and essays ranged widely, he often returned to civil rights, writing for many years \u2014 and for several publications \u2014 of his frequent interviews with King in the basement of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery.\n\nAD\n\nOn one 1959 visit, he told the civil rights leader of five distant ancestors who had been \u201cpoisoned by a slave\u201d on their plantation near Bridgeboro, Ga., according to notes in a family Bible. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d King told him, \u201cyou and I can hold this respectful talk \u2014 you, the son of slave owners, and I, the son of slaves who once lived together in the Red Hills of Georgia. Isn\u2019t that reassuring?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs we parted he asked if there was anything he might do for me,\u201d Mr. Jenkins wrote in a 1985 Evening Sun op-ed. \u201cI told him that I had heard many of his speeches, and that if one day he would drop in what he had said about the sons of slaves and sons of slave owners from the Red Hills of Georgia, I would be honored. He said that he would.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFour years later, Mr. Jenkins was driving home from the March on Washington when he listened on the radio as King neared the end of his speech. It had been a long day, and Mr. Jenkins had decided to go home early, before King took the microphone and declared, \u201cI have a dream that one day on the Red Hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had kept his promise,\u201d Mr. Jenkins wrote, \u201cand I wasn\u2019t even there to hear it.\u201d", "description": "His reporting on vice and corruption helped Georgia\u2019s Columbus Ledger newspaper win the 1955 Pulitzer Prize for public service.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QpfA5YJSb2msNrDC6vjUhCk-t9k=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UC2TUKX2SEI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
