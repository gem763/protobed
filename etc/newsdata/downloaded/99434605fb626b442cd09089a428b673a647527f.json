REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\n(Reuters) - Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N), the world\u2019s largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said on Wednesday its distributable earnings in the third quarter fell 8% year-on-year, but still beat analyst estimates.\n\nBlackstone reported a drop in proceeds from asset sales in its private equity business, offset partly by a rise in distributable earnings in its real estate, corporate credit and hedge funds divisions.\n\nDistributable earnings per share came in at 58 cents, higher than the 53 cents that analysts estimated on average, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.\n\nThe New York-based buyout firm said income per share on a diluted basis rose to $1.15, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), up 80% from a year ago.\n\nMovements in stock prices of companies affect private equity firms because their private investments are valued using public markets as a yardstick. Buyout firms also have large public market assets, which they are looking to sell off at a profit.\n\nBlackstone said its private equity portfolio appreciated 2.6% in the third quarter. Opportunistic and core real estate funds rose by 3.8% and 2.3% respectively.\n\nThe firm raised a record $26 billion for its flagship buyout fund during the quarter, as it benefited from a strong fundraising environment driven by institutional investors seeking higher returns amid low interest rates.\n\nTotal assets under management rose to a $554 billion in the three months to September, up 2% from $545.5 billion in the prior quarter.", "description": "Blackstone Group Inc , the world's largest manager of alternative assets such as private equity and real estate, said on Wednesday its distributable earnings in the third quarter fell 8% year-on-year, but still beat analyst estimates.", "authors": ["Chibuike Oguh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1444087664&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M0ZN", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
