Boone said the slugger was injured running out a single in the second inning. That was four innings before he hit a solo home run off Zach Greinke in New York's 7-0 victory, and the left fielder also made a nice defensive play when moving to catch a liner.\n\n\"So hoping that it's something that with today and the off day, that he would be back in play for Game 3,\" Boone said. \"We'll just kind of see how these next 48 hours unfold.\"\n\nBoone said Stanton could be a pinch-hitting option in Game 2 and could play the field in an emergency. There is a day off in the series Monday before Game 3 in New York on Tuesday night.\n\nStanton was limited to 18 games during the regular season because of biceps, shoulder, calf and knee injuries. A strained right knee kept him out nearly two months before coming back Sept. 18.\n\nAn MRI was done Sunday that showed a strain in the quad on the same leg.\n\nStanton had started the first four games for the Yankees this postseason. That included all three games in the AL Division Series against Minnesota, when he was 1 for 6 with four walks and a sacrifice fly in 11 plate appearances.\n\nCameron Maybin was in the lineup Sunday, batting seventh against Astros ace Justin Verlander and playing left field in place of the 2017 NL MVP. Boone went with Maybin over Aaron Hicks, who missed almost the last two months of the regular season and the AL Division Series because of a right flexor strain.\n\n\"Tough call. Obviously Verlander is a tough matchup either way,\" Boone said. \"Just felt like with Aaron not having played obviously in a game yet, it's a tough first game back draw.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
