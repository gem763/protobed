Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired off a flippant tweet Rep. Dan Crenshaw\u2019s way, telling the Texas congressman he ought not lend his guns to his friends because they\u2019re \u201clikely\u201d to have \u201cabused their spouse or have a violent criminal record,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhat?\n\nHopefully, she was speaking without thinking \u2014 in trademark AOC style \u2014 and not actually accusing Crenshaw of hanging out with hoodlums.\n\nYou decide.\n\nHere\u2019s what Crenshaw first tweeted, in context of referencing a story about a woman who used a handgun to defend herself against five alleged robbers, The Hill reported: \u201cSituations like this story are why we protect the 2nd Amendment. Side note: With universal background checks, I wouldn\u2019t be able to let my friends borrow my handgun when they travel alone like this. We would make felons out of people just for defending themselves.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez weighed in shortly after with \u2014 again, trademark AOC style \u2014 this somewhat baffling message.\n\n\u201cYou are a member of Congress,\u201d she tweeted back to Crenshaw. \u201cWhy are you \u2018lending\u2019 guns to people unsupervised who can\u2019t pass a basic background check? The people you\u2019re giving a gun to have likely abused their spouse or have a violent criminal record, & you may not know it. Why on earth would you do that?\u201d\n\nDid Ocasio-Cortez just accuse Crenshaw of having friends who were wife beaters and violent criminals?\n\nMethinks she did.\n\nRegardless, laws already address the transfer or lending of firearms to friends and strangers alike. For instance, federal law recognizes the right of gun owners to sell or loan weapons to others, so long as those others aren\u2019t already barred from owning, buying or using guns. State laws vary.\n\nApparently \u2014 so don\u2019t congressional opinions.\n\nOf which, on this, as on most topics, Ocasio-Cortez should keep to herself.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
