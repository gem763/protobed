Brussels Edition: Getting Brexit Done\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Welcome to the Brussels Edition, Bloomberg\u2019s daily briefing on what matters most in the heart of the European Union. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.\n\nWithin the past 24 hours, a Brexit deal has seemed exasperatingly within touching distance, only for a series of conflicting messages, denials and clarifications to muddy the waters. But with hours to go before a critical summit of European leaders, the signs point to an unstoppable political will to finally put an end to a divorce saga that has dragged on for years. The big question is, of course, whether any potential deal will secure the backing of an unruly British Parliament and what the implications would be if it doesn\u2019t.\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening\n\nTurkish Trouble | Another hot potato on EU leaders\u2019 plate during their two-day meeting is Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria \u2014 a move that prompted the bloc\u2019s foreign ministers to curb arms exports to the country, and Donald Trump to write this legendary letter. That and Turkey\u2019s controversial energy exploration off Cyprus have exacerbated tensions already heightened by the Turkish President\u2019s crackdown on domestic political opponents.\n\nMoney Talks | Discussions on the EU\u2019s seven-year budget were always going to be tricky as Britain\u2019s (probably) imminent departure from the bloc leaves a hole that must somehow be plugged. During their summit, leaders will discuss the \u201cvolume\u201d and the conditions attached to the disbursement of the trillion-euro funds, but with the latest compromise proposal being shot down by EU countries earlier this week, the aim of coming up with figures by December appears ambitious .\n\nUrsula\u2019s Plans | This could get slightly awkward. Leaders will hear about the European Commission\u2019s priorities for the next five years from President-elect Ursula von der Leyen. Problem is, her team won\u2019t start on time after a debacle involving France\u2019s pick, which dealt an embarrassing blow to Emmanuel Macron.\n\nItaly\u2019s Budget | Italy\u2019s government is counting on the goodwill of EU partners to start delivering on promises to voters, but the coalition already is paring down its ambitions. It has made promises that will widen the country\u2019s structural deficit slightly in 2020. That will require flexibility from the Commission, which must sign off on the plan.\n\nIn Case You Missed It\n\nSpanish Turmoil | Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is under pressure to restore order in Catalonia after a night of violence in cities across the region in the wake of jail sentences handed down to separatist leaders. This is all playing out against the backdrop of a campaign ahead of an election in November, raising the stakes for the Spanish premier as he comes under fire from political rivals to respond.\n\nMajor Shift | The German political class is preparing itself to deliver bold fiscal stimulus if the economy needs it. With Europe\u2019s largest economy potentially facing a major hit if the Brexit negotiations unravel or the conflict in Syria spirals out of control, here\u2019s what is focusing minds in Berlin and why. Meanwhile, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said stepping up spending is \u201ccompletely disconnected\u201d from reality.\n\nChip Control | EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager ordered Broadcom (NASDAQ: ) to drop allegedly unfair clauses that may compel set-top-box makers to use its chips, deploying a rarely used weapon meant to prevent victims from suffering while probes drag on for years. The move follows criticism that probes into Google and Intel took so long that by the time fines were levied, victims were thwarted.\n\nDirty Money | After finding itself at the epicenter of a money-laundering scandal \u2014 involving transfers from Russia to the West \u2014 Estonia is staking a claim on the fines imposed on the nation\u2019s banks as a result. Its finance minister thinks this could actually raise a lot; he took to Facebook (NASDAQ: ) to say this could bring in hundreds of millions and \u201cpossibly about billions.\u201d\n\nScooter Tensions | Luxembourg didn\u2019t just have EU finance ministers swoop in last week. Bird, one of the world\u2019s largest scooter companies, did the same, just in a more cloak-and-dagger fashion. Rows of its scooters suddenly appeared overnight in the city\u2019s banking district, taking the mayor\u2019s office by complete surprise.\n\nChart of the Day\n\nItaly\u2019s manufacturing slump is set to deepen in coming months after industrial orders from abroad shrank the most in almost a decade. Cooling global trade and a slowdown in the currency bloc are further complicating the outlook for Europe\u2019s second-largest manufacturer. Italy\u2019s statistics office yesterday said industrial orders fell 10% in August, the biggest decline since October 2012.\n\nToday\u2019s Agenda\n\nAll times CET.\n\nPrime Minister of Poland speaks at Friends of Europe event in Brussels\n\n3 p.m. EU leaders meet in Brussels to discuss Brexit, climate change, EU enlargement, measures against Turkey, confirm appointments of the European Commission and ECB Presidents\n\nLike the Brussels Edition?\n\nDon\u2019t keep it to yourself.
