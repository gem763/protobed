It's, it's absolutely a given that they will come back.\u201d\n\nMattis was also critical of Trump\u2019s decision to abandon support of Kurdish fighters in the region, arguing that it will make it difficult for Washington to make allies in the future. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was the main U.S. ally in the fight and lost 11,000 fighters in the nearly five-year battle against ISIS.\n\n\u201cReinstilling trust will be difficult for Americans at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that Turkey won't stop until the Syrian Kurdish forces withdraw at least 20 miles from the border.\n\nThe Turkish military aims to clear Syrian border towns of Kurdish fighters' presence, saying they are a national security threat. Since Wednesday, Turkish troops and Syrian opposition fighters backed by Ankara have been advancing under the cover of airstrikes and artillery shelling.\n\nMattis\u2019 comments differ strongly from those of the man who took his former job.\n\nUS TO MOVE ABOUT 50 ISIS FIGHTERS FROM SYRIA TO IRAQ AMID TURKISH ASSAULT, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday defended the president\u2019s call to remove U.S. troops from Syria \u2013 saying the move will be done \u201cas safely and quickly as possible\u201d \u2013 but admitted that the situation was growing more worrisome by the minute.\n\nEsper said he spoke to Trump on Saturday night amid growing signs that the Turkish invasion, which began Wednesday, was growing more dangerous.\n\n\"In the last 24 hours, we learned that they (the Turks) likely intend to expand their attack further south than originally planned \u2014 and to the west,\" Esper said.\n\nThe U.S. also has come to believe that the Kurds are attempting to \"cut a deal\" with the Syrian Army and Russia to counter the invading Turks, he said. As a result, Trump \"directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria,\" Esper said.\n\nTrump, in a tweet Sunday, said: \"Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?\"\n\nEsper said he was aware of reports of hundreds of ISIS prisoners escaping as a result of the Turkish invasion and of atrocities being committed against Syrian Kurds by members of a Turkish-supported Syrian Arab militia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It gets worse by the hour,\" Esper said. \"These are all the exact things\" that U.S. officials warned Erdogan would likely happen by ignoring U.S. urgings not to invade northern Syria.\n\nEsper said there was \"no way\" U.S. forces could have stopped the Turks, who assembled a force of about 15,000 troops on the Syrian border, supported by air power.\n\n\"We did not sign up to fight Turkey, a longstanding NATO ally, on behalf of the (Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces). This is a terrible situation,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis criticized President Trump\u2019s decision to remove American troops from Syria, saying in his first public comments on the matter that the Islamic State now \u201cwill resurge\u201d in the region.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/01/02/694940094001_5985399807001_5985394683001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
