Macquarie Telecom's managed cloud service had initially been given the security tick by the ASD in May 2015, making it the first Australian cloud provider to be listed on the federal government's certified list.\n\nSpeaking with ZDNet earlier this year about the Australian government's shift to the cloud, Tudehope said he would argue that it isn't enough to simply move to the cloud in a \"forced march\" as it may leave government, as well as private sector, with a cloud provider lock-in situation.\n\n\"The challenge at the moment for government is that they see the shiny lights of some cloud providers and often go in heavily with one particular provider,\" he told ZDNet.\n\n\"The problem then is they get locked in and if you've got a long term project that needs to be rolled out in many phases ... the decision to go with one cloud provider upfront may have made sense, but by the time the rubber hits the road and it starts to deliver citizen services, that answer may have changed and they may no longer be the right one.\"\n\nHe said what has perhaps happened within government is that those who were early adopters of public cloud saw the \"bling bling\" -- the shiny lights -- of the promise of public cloud and went in early, not realising they may have just shifted to a cloud-based version of a proprietary environment.\n\nFor the first half of the 2019 financial year, Macquarie Telecom reported AU$8.3 million in after-tax profit, an increase of 4% over the AU$8 million reported for the first half of the 2018 financial year.\n\nEBITDA was up 13% to AU$25.5 million, while revenue was AU$119.6 million, up 4% year on year.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nMacGov says Australian government is becoming stifled by cloud vendor lock-in\n\nMacquarie Government's MD details how sending everything to the one vendor has left Commonwealth entities in a similar situation to the one they were in before.\n\nMacTel announces government cloud expansion\n\nMacquarie Telecom has announced datacentre capacity expansions, as well as government cloud and cybersecurity growth to the tune of an additional AU$1.5 million in opex.\n\nMacquarie stands up Australian health cloud\n\nThe Macquarie Launch Health Cloud is a private cloud developed by the Australian heavyweight specifically for the healthcare sector.\n\nMacTel announces AU$85m Macquarie Park datacentre expansion\n\nMacquarie Telecom has said it will be expanding its Macquarie Park Intellicentre in a staged process, with the first part to cost between AU$75 million and AU$85 million in capex during 2019.", "description": "The security operations centre offering has been launched to address the threats government agencies are faced with.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/20/71154639-c01a-4477-87cb-bcbf979eb012/thumbnail/770x578/9c34c9fea9144a37acb1d9f3de9e6390/istock-1061357610.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
