Belgian officials said the 36-year-old plane, which was not carrying weapons, suffered unspecified engine trouble.\n\nEmergency workers extracted the stuck pilot safely after cutting off power in the area, and he was taken to a nearby hospital for medical checks, a spokesman for the regional administration told The Associated Press. The other pilot landed without incident.\n\nSurrounding homes were evacuated as the airman was being taken down and firefighters battled the blaze from the crash.\n\nThe pilots flagged an \"engine technical incident\" while flying from Florennes air base in Belgium to the military airport in the French city of Lorient, the Belgian Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\nOne of the plane's wings sliced through the roof and facade of a house in the town of Pluvigner, in Britanny, before the F-16 plunged into a neighboring farm field, said Ludovic Kauffer, who lives in the house.\n\nKauffer was at work at the time of the morning accident, but his parents were home and described to him the \"booms\" of the crash.\n\n\"My mother is in shock, my father is too,\" he told The AP. \"The most important thing is that everyone is OK.\"\n\nThe plane, which entered service in 1983, was a navigation training mission and en route to a naval air base in France when it came down between the towns of Pluvigner and Landaul, Belgian and French authorities said.\n\n\"We detected the emergency signals ... at 10:33 a.m. (0833GMT),\" said Belgian Air Force Maj. Gen. Frederik Vansina.\n\nVansina told reporters in Brussels that one of the pilots said \"he noticed a problem in the engine of the plane, so we have now to investigate to know what are the exact causes.\"\n\n\"Both pilots are safe and sound,\" he said. The pilot stuck on the power line \"told me he was feeling very well.\"\n\nThe plane itself was not carrying weapons, the local French administration said.\n\nBelgian air safety investigators will head to France to join the probe.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSamuel Petrequin in Brussels and David Vincent in Pluvigner, France contributed.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
