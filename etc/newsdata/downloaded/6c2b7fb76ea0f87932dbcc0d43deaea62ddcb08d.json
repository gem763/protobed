Not miserable sods.\n\n(Image: Daily Post Wales)\n\n(Image: RUSSELL WATSON COLLECT.)\n\nThe most important thing in the world to me suddenly wasn\u2019t success and sustaining it.\n\nI\u2019d have people on the phone saying, \u2018Got an interview for you on Saturday and you need to do it.\u2019\n\nI\u2019d say, \u2018But it\u2019s my only day off this week.\u2019\n\n\u2018I know, but it\u2019s really important.\u2019\n\nThere was one year, around 2002, it was so intense that I slept in my own bed twice that year.\n\nNow I just say, \u2018P*ss off, I\u2019m having a day off and spending some time with my family and that\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nGary Barlow was on the same working men\u2019s club circuit as me back in the day.\n\nAbout 10 years ago we were chatting and he said, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have missed that for the world, because it gives you an apprenticeship, you learn how to communicate with an audience.\n\nIf something goes wrong you learn how to deal with it on the spot.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s true.\n\n(Image: Daily Post Wales)\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nMy grandad was a fantastic piano player and was coached to the highest level, but he was too nervous and shy to get on stage.\n\nI remember as a kid there was a massive Steinway piano in his front lounge, which basically dominated the whole area.\n\nWhen he used to play all the Chopin waltzes, I\u2019d just go in there and sit and lean against the piano leg for hours just listening to him play.\n\nI couldn\u2019t move.\n\nI wasn\u2019t interested in playing with Action Men or anything.\n\nI\u2019d just go in, sit, feel the vibrations down my back and just listen to him playing.\n\nI loved every minute of it.\n\nThrough his insecurities my grandad became an alcoholic, and that\u2019s what killed him in the end.\n\nHe died in his 50s, sadly.\n\nI think he\u2019d have been mega proud of me.\n\nAttaining success is relatively easy, sustaining it is bloody hard work.\n\nI think in the early days I was selling more records than most of the high-profile pop artists.\n\nI was one of the biggest-selling male artists in the UK, the first ever million seller as a classical artist, I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s done it since.\n\nI was on the crest of a wave, so you start walking with a bit more of a swagger.\n\nWell, it only lasts for so long and every peak has its trough.\n\nI did a gig at the Vatican and it was amazing.\n\nI remember how they pitched it \u2013 \u2018a private concert for Pope John Paul II\n\nThere\u2019s 3,500 people in the audience, all specially invited dignitaries and royalty from across Europe.\n\nIn the front row you\u2019ve got 50 red-robed cardinals, you\u2019ve got the Pope in his own little private box area, I had a 140-piece orchestra, 500 choral singers and supposedly 500 million people watching it live on television.\n\nI remember thinking, \u2018Blimey, if this is private, I wonder what a public one\u2019s like!\u2019\n\nMy secret snapshot\n\nYou know what a Shih Tzu is?\n\nA zoo with no animals!\n\nNo, the Shih Tzu is called Muffin, the Saluki on the right is Poppy and the black greyhound is Blaize, they\u2019re rescues.\n\nThe greyhound adores my missus and the Shih Tzu never leaves my side.\n\nWhen I go into the hall to sing, to do my vocal scales, Muffin comes in and starts howling next to me \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s a good thing!\n\nI\u2019ll be going, \u201cLa la la la la la la la,\u201d and the dog will be like, \u201cAroooo!\u201d next to me.\n\nSounds better than some of the sopranos I\u2019ve worked with\u2026\n\nBlaize was on a photoshoot I was doing a few years ago.\n\nWe were over-running at the end of the day and my assistant goes, \u201cHe needs to get back, the dogs\u2019 home shuts at half past five.\u201d\n\nI looked down at the dog, the dog looks up at me and I\u2019m like, \u201cSh*t, he\u2019s coming home with us,\u201d and he\u2019s been with us ever since.\n\nPoppy was thrown out of the back of a van at 70 miles an hour, wrapped in a blanket.\n\nShe was in a pool of blood, with all her legs broken at the side of the motorway. So we took her on from the rescue centre\n\nI can go away for two weeks and sometimes I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the dogs more than the missus!\n\nI can get in at 2am and the wife\u2019s upstairs snoring , but the dogs are stood by the door like, \u201cEy up, where have you been?\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll get upstairs and my missus will say, \u201cTurn the light off, it\u2019s too bright!\u201d I\u2019ll be like, \u201cCheers!\u201d\n\nRussell Watson and Aled Jones release their second album, Back In Harmony on 1st November", "description": "The classical music star on what his brain tumour taught him about life and fame and his love for his Shih Tzu and Saluki dogs", "authors": ["Russell Watson", "Talking To Adam Beresford", "Image", "Daily Post Wales", "Russell Watson Collect.", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708520.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Carolau-o-Llandudno.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
