Once led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, it now proposes sweeping nationalisation and an overhaul of the banking system.\n\nThe 68-year-old McDonnell held a series of meetings with top finance executives in 2017, setting out how it would levy taxes on one of the world's biggest financial trading centres if it won power from the Conservative Party.\n\nAt the time it proposed expanding an existing tax on shares to include trading on other assets such as bonds and derivatives. Set at around half of a percentage point on the value of a trade, it was predicted then to raise 4.7 billion pounds a year.\n\nThe report released on Thursday said that tax could be extended further to include transactions within the wholesale foreign exchange market, including FX spot and derivatives, interest rate derivatives and commodities. It proposed taxing end user purchasers who are tax resident in Britain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"OWN GOAL\"\n\nTheCityUK, representing financial and related professional services, said London was already locked in a battle to fend off rival centres from luring companies and jobs away due to Brexit, and that plans such as these would make that much harder.\n\n\"The UK is a world-leader in financial and related professional services, but our lead will not last long if we start booting balls into our own net,\" Chief Executive Miles Celic said.\n\nMany top bankers have expressed fear that Brexit will slowly undermine London's pre-eminent position as the world's biggest international financial centre.\n\nForeign exchange - the largest and most interconnected of global markets and worth trillions of dollars a day - is the crown jewel of London's financial services industry.\n\n\"Financial services paid over 75 billion pounds in tax last year and accounts for more than one million jobs nationwide,\" another trade body, UK Finance, said.\n\n\"At a time of great uncertainty for business we would encourage policymakers to focus on proposals that would support the growth and competitiveness of the UK's financial sector.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kylie MacLellan; writing by Kate Holton; editing by William James and Toby Chopra)", "description": "Britain's opposition Labour Party would seek to broaden a tax on financial transactions to cover foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives and commodities to raise further funds from London's powerful financial centre if elected.
