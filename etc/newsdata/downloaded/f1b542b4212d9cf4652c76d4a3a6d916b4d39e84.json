Behind the closed doors of a congressional task force last month, Comcast's video ads division FreeWheel accused Alphabet's Google of using privacy concerns as a pretext to limit FreeWheel's ability to sell ads on behalf of its clients' YouTube channels, four people briefed on the discussion said. Comcast may be drawing a line in the sand and wants to avoid letting Google do to the video ad business what it has done to the online ad market. It is the first time one of the most powerful companies in the United States, with its own muscular lobbying apparatus in Washington, is taking sides in the antitrust battle looming over the world's largest seller of online ads. Google's competitors are warning lawmakers that emerging privacy regulations could help Google extend its dominance.\n\nBrian Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer of Comcast Corp. Patrick T.

The issues raised by Comcast and its subsidiary have been echoed widely in the cable and ad technology industries. Most companies that contend Google has unfairly squeezed them out have been reticent to speak out because they rely on Google services and fear retaliation. But Comcast, which owns media company NBC, Universal Pictures and the Xfinity internet service, is a large spender on state and federal lobbying and election campaigns and a veteran of political organizing. The House Judiciary Committee, U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of 50 state-level attorneys general have each asked Google for information about its ads business in recent weeks as they begin investigating potential violations of antitrust law. Google declined to comment on Comcast's recent actions but has said it is cooperating with the investigations and that it faces robust competition in advertising, including from Comcast.\n\nPrivacy push\n\nFreeWheel's tensions with Google stem from a one-of-a-kind agreement struck in 2009 as YouTube sought to burnish its image with clips from well-known TV channels. The deal enables media companies such as NBC, Turner, now owned by AT&T, and Viacom to sell ads alongside their content on YouTube using FreeWheel's technology rather than Google's competing tool, ensuring access to their single, preferred system across various streaming websites and apps. FreeWheel is the go-to video ad server because of its experience, said a FreeWheel client, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But last year, Google closed FreeWheel's pipe into YouTube in Europe, citing the EU's General Data Protection Regulation that imposed new requirements on companies seeking to share consumer data. In the United States, Google has allowed FreeWheel's continued use on the condition that starting with tests this month, the tens of media companies reliant on it will be cut off from accessing some user data for privacy reasons, one of the sources said. The data reduction could make FreeWheel's system less attractive to media companies and their advertisers, potentially prompting a shift to Google, the source said.\n\nGoogle said a small percentage of YouTube revenue is affected and that it has been working with FreeWheel to restore access in Europe and preserve it in the United States. A FreeWheel representative brought up the issue at a private hearing in September of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Tech Task Force, led by Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn, the sources briefed on the discussion said. Blackburn, who is holding hearings to inform potential privacy laws, said on C-SPAN last week that a Congressional privacy bill being weighed must preserve competition better than EU regulations have. Her spokeswoman declined to comment on FreeWheel's task force comments.\n\nInternet tracking", "description": "Comcast is wading into the epic regulatory pile-on against big tech companies such as Google, according to people familiar with the matter.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106011469-1562764097611gettyimages-1154832132.jpeg?v=1562773392", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
