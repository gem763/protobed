You start foreseeing the day through lenses of \"dread\" and anticipate another bad day. A cycle of feeling disappoint after disappoint. Sometimes it can even get to the point where you don't even want to live anymore. Where you feel like its never going to change..I can full sympathize with you,\" the singer began.\n\n\"I can not change my mindset. I am fortunate to have people I'm life that continue encourage me to keep going. You see I have alot of money, clothes cars, accolades, achievements, awards and I was still unfulfilled. Have u noticed the statistics of child stars and the outcome of their life? There is an insane pressure and responsibility put on a child whose brain, emotions, frontal lobes (decision making) aren't developed yet. No rationality, defiant, rebellious, things all of us have to go through. But when you add the pressure of stardom it does something to you that is quite unexplainable.\"\n\nView photos\n\nHe continued, \"You see I didn't grow up in a stable home, my parent were 18 separated with no money still young and rebellious as well. As my talent progressed and I became ultra successful it happened within a strand of Two years. My whole world was flipped on its head. I went from a 13 year old boy from a small town to be praised left and right by the world with millions saying how much they loved me and how great I was.\"\n\n\"I don't know about you but humility comes with age. You hear theses things enough as a young boy and you actually start believing it, Rationality comes with age and so does your decision making process (one of the reasons you can't drink until your 21) .. everyone did everything for me so I never even learned the fundamentals of responsibility.\"", "description": "Justin just exposed his inner demons", "authors": ["Mike Walters"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qtcK1q3fkjrOnlU_wfXLSw--~B/aD0xMTkwO3c9MjEwODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/theblast_73/9e1f52e4b8f021e3d6f4a2b5d0bf5447"}
