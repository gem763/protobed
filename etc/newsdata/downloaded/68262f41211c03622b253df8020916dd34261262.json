James Risch (R-Idaho): \u201cI\u2019m a juror and I\u2019m comfortable not speaking.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a juror and I\u2019m comfortable not speaking.\" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) : \"I\u2019d be a juror, so I have no comment.\"\n\n: \"I\u2019d be a juror, so I have no comment.\" Sen.

Susan Collins (R-Maine): \"I am very likely to be a juror so to make a predetermined decision on whether or not to convict a president of the United States does not fulfill one\u2019s constitutional responsibilities.\"\n\nBut, but, but: Republicans aren't alone.

Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). \"And have talked about this as a political endeavor rather than ... to approach it as our job which is a potential jurist.\"\n\nBetween the lines: Not everyone agrees with the argument that being a juror prevents senators from speaking out about Trump's alleged abuses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in a jury trial in the classic criminal sense. It is a political proceeding and we shirk our duty to the nation if we fail to talk,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should shirk our responsibilities as senators ... just because one day we might be a juror,\u201d Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.\n\nGo deeper: How an impeachment inquiry works", "description": "Bipartisan senators are increasingly abstaining from comment as more revelations emerge from the impeachment inquiry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/guD7Or33ULTa6zB-6U4hJy6RUGw=/0x0:2254x1268/1920x1080/2019/10/28/1572298236117.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
