Watch the second, final season of #StarWarsResistance, premiering Sunday, October 6 at 6pm PDT on @DisneyXD and 10pm PDT on @DisneyChannel and in the DisneyNOW app. pic.twitter.com/YPzadcxpgG \u2014 Star Wars (@starwars) September 25, 2019\n\nWith the First Order breathing down their necks, Kaz (Christopher Sean) and his pals launched the Colossus from the planet Castilon into space. They will start season two on the run, encountering a wide array of new and familiar \"Star Wars\" characters.\n\n\"The ship is in disrepair, they're running out of food and supplies,\" says executive producer and supervising director Justin Ridge. \"Now they need to survive.\"\n\nSeason two will also focus on Tamara Ryvora (Suzie McGrath), Kaz's disillusioned former friend who was just recruited by the First Order.\n\n\"I'm super excited for Tam's arc,\" says executive producer Brandon Auman. \"I feel like that's something we've never really seen before in Star Wars, where we follow a sympathetic character into the First Order, this evil organization. What does she learn? What does she get out of it? How does she grow? In many ways, her story arc is just as important as Katz's in season two.\"\n\nWith all the awesome Star Wars coming in the next few months, from Fallen Order to Mandalorian to Rise of Skywalker, it\u2019s easy to forget we are getting more of the incredible #StarWarsResistance in only two weeks!! pic.twitter.com/zgH3Mpl6Vf \u2014 Adam Odle (@OdleAdam) September 23, 2019\n\nSeason one featured crossover appearances by characters like Poe Dameron, Leia Organa, Capt. Phasma and BB-8. Season two promises appearances by the red-helmeted bounty hunter Sidon Ithano and First Order rising star Kylo Ren. Longtime \"Star Wars\" sound designer and actor Matthew Wood provides Kylo's voice.\n\nThe show's producers want \"Resistance\" to be able to stand on its own, but admit it's been fun tying elements of the storytelling into the bigger \"Star Wars\" galaxy.\n\n\"It's been a dream to create these new characters and this family that we've never really seen before,\" says Ridge. \"To tie it in to the movies, and to have it be concurrent with 'The Last Jedi' and going up to 'The Rise of Skywalker' is a blast. It's really cool for us to figure out how all that is connected.\"\n\n\"Star Wars,\" Lucasfilm, and ABC News are all part of parent company Disney.", "description": "", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/star-wars-resistance-abc-190927_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
