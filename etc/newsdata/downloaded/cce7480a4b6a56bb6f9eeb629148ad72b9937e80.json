This claim was proven false when it was discovered that Sir Edmund reached the summit six years after Mrs. Clinton was born. After a trip to Bosnia in 2008, Hillary Clinton came back telling the media that when they landed in Bosnia, she had to run away from sniper fire. However, video footage showed otherwise. A CBS News video showed Clinton arriving and greeting a child, but no sign of distress or gun fire. On 9/11 Hillary Clinton told the media that her daughter, Chelsea Clinton was jogging around the World Trade Center during the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Months later, Chelsea wrote a first-hand account of her September 11th experience saying that during the attacks, she was watching TV in her apartment. In the early 90's, then First Lady Hillary Clinton and her Chief of Staff sat up into the wee hours of the morning shredding documents related to the White Water scandal she and her husband Bill were being investigated for. Around that time, it was reported that one of her aids walked out of the White House with documents under her clothing. So, what would make Clinton spread falsehoods about Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard being groomed by the Russians? Who's next on Clinton's political 'hit-list'? Better yet, can anyone believe a word Clinton says?", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
