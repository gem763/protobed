He can see the warning signs. The missed plays. The breakdowns. He believes a team\u2019s struggles can carry over from week-to-week.\n\nIt creates an opportunity for the defense.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be itching to make a play,\u201d Collins said, adding offenses tend to try and force it when that happens.\n\nThe \u201cthey\u201d in this case would be the Chicago Bears, who will meet the Redskins in prime time on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d at FedEx Field.\n\nWith quarterback Mitch Trubisky, the Bears are averaging just 9.5 points per game \u2014 tied for second-to-last in the NFL. They\u2019ve scored 19 points total, leaving Chicago fans panicked that Trubisky could single-handedly derail the team\u2019s Super Bowl aspirations. The 25-year-old hasn\u2019t looked good this season, nor has he lived up to his draft status since being taken second overall in 2017.\n\nIn theory, Trubisky is coming to town at exactly the right time for the Redskins. He is not Carson Wentz nor Dak Prescott, and the talent drop-off should help Washington prove its defense isn\u2019t as awful as it looked in the first two games.\n\nBut if the Redskins are eager to play Trubisky, they aren\u2019t showing it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that go along with that,\u201d linebacker Jon Bostic said of the quarterback\u2019s struggles. \u201cI know some people might put it all on him, but it\u2019s not true. It\u2019s everybody. \u2026 There\u2019s\u2019 a lot of things that have to go right.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins aren\u2019t in a position to boast. The last two games left defenders shocked and desperate for answers after giving up 63 points combined. Defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said Thursday the team has to do a better job of getting after the quarterback.\n\nWashington could be again without defensive lineman Jonathan Allen (knee) and cornerback Quinton Dunbar (knee) this week. Both players missed practice Thursday, and in Allen\u2019s case, coach Jay Gruden called the injury \u201csignificant.\u201d Allen has a Grade 1 knee sprain and the Redskins aren\u2019t trying to rush him back.\n\nWhen analyzing the Bears\u2019 offense, multiple players singled out the variety and creativity of the team\u2019s formations. Coach Matt Nagy is a disciple of Andy Reid and has brought that innovation to Chicago. The Bears also have talented playmakers like wide receiver Allen Robinson, tight end Trey Burton and running backs Tarik Cohen and David Montgomery.\n\nCornerback Josh Norman said the Redskins have to be prepared for Chicago\u2019s different looks. Philadelphia and Dallas both took advantage of Washington not being set before the snap, leading to long touchdowns.\n\nStill, coaches can only help a quarterback to a point \u2014 and it will be on Trubisky to execute.\n\nAfter an opening night loss to Green Bay, Packers cornerback Tramon Williams rubbed in the Bears\u2019 defeat further by telling reporters: \u201cWe wanted to make Mitch play quarterback.\u201d Williams later tried to clarify his remark wasn\u2019t meant to be a shot, but that didn\u2019t change the perception.\n\nTrubisky is averaging a measly 4.8 yards per attempt and has completed only 58% of his passes.\n\nCollins said the Redskins will be prepared no matter how the Bears try to attack.\n\n\u201cIf they come out throwing the ball with Trubisky, hey, power to \u2018em,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIf they want to come out running \u2014 they\u2019ve got a good running game \u2014 power to \u2018em. We\u2019ve got a good run-stop defense. We\u2019ve got a good secondary, so we\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
