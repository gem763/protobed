In 1965, the law in some states was updated to prevent masked gatherings of two or more people, except in the case of masquerade parties.\n\nCanada approved a bill in 2013 to forbid people from covering their faces during a riot or unlawful assembly. The offense carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail.\n\nSince the 1970s, various European countries enacted laws banning people from wearing masks to hide their personal identity at public events.\n\nAs the full-face veil won by Muslim women became a hot-button issue across Europe over the past decade, France was the first European country to ban burkas, niqabs, balaclavas, hoods and other such items in public places with a law that took effect in 2011. Those who violate the law can be fined up to \u20ac150 (US$166).", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/36/b4/6c5580ef401a879b7d961a70acc5/191003-hong-kong-protesters-gty-773.jpg"}
