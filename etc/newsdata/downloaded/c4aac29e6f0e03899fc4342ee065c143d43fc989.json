Biden.\n\n\u201cYes, any false ad should be fact-checked and removed, including this one,\u201d said Daniel Wessel, the DNC\u2019s deputy war room director, The Hill reported. \u201cFacebook owes that to its users.\u201d\n\nMr. Wessel was referring to a specific ad released last week by the Trump campaign attacking Mr. Biden, the current front-runner among Democrats vying to run in 2020 against Mr. Trump, The Hill reported.\n\nThe ad claims Mr. Biden \u201cpromised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d echoing an allegation that Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders have asserted on the heels of the president\u2019s own scandal involving the Eastern European country.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s ad is part of an effort to push a false narrative intended to deceive and distract from the fact that he pressured a foreign leader to investigate a political rival in order to help his reelection, while withholding critical U.S. aid to that country \u2014 and his own White House released a document that proves it,\u201d said Mr. Wessel, The Hill reported.\n\n\u201cHis campaign relies on a shameful strategy built on outright lies to the American public about the content of his phone call with the Ukrainian president. We all have a role to play in combating these lies, and that includes Facebook,\u201d Mr. Wessel said.\n\nFacebook did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign released the anti-Biden ads last week after a whistleblower complaint filed by a member of the U.S. intelligence community triggered Democrats in the House of Representatives to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, during a July phone call to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, according to a rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House.\n\nCongress is considering whether the White House tried to suppress information about the call and if Mr. Trump abused his power of the presidency by making the request while his administration blocked the release of military aid to Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Trump campaign said last week that the anti-Biden ad was part of a $10 million campaign. It subsequently released a new spot Wednesday accusing Democrats seeking impeachment of pursuing a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has spent more than $1.6 million on Facebook ads between last Wednesday, Sept. 25, and this Tuesday, Oct. 1, according to the social network\u2019s public Ad Archive. The campaign has bought more than $19 million worth of Facebook ads since May 2018, according to the company.\n\nNick Clegg, Facebook vice president, recently said that the platform would not be fact-checking any posts or paid ads placed on behalf of political candidates, prompting the DNC\u2019s chief executive officer to raise concerns earlier this week.\n\n\u201cSocial media platforms have a responsibility to protect our democracy and counter disinformation online. This is a serious missed opportunity,\u201d said Seema Nanda, the DNC\u2019s CEO.\n\nMr. Biden has denied wrongdoing with respect to his handling of Ukraine while vice president.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
