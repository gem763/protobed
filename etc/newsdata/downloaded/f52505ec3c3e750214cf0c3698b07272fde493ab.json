Three aftershocks, of magnitude 4.7 and 4.6, hit within less than an hour in the same region at the same depth.\n\nKiara Hern\u00e1ndez, spokeswoman for the island\u2019s Emergency Management Agency, told The Associated Press that there were no immediate reports of damage and that there was no risk of tsunami.\n\nShe said emergency management officials were already on alert for the approaching Tropical Depression Karen and communicated quickly with mayors and others across the island to check on any damage.\n\nThe National Guard also had been activated for the storm, and schools and government offices remained closed as heavy rains were forecast for Puerto Rico on Tuesday, with warnings of possible flooding and landslides.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez said crews would be inspecting buildings to ensure their safety.\n\n\u201cWe will know this information little by little,\u201d she said.\n\nThe quake was felt across Puerto Rico and was the strongest to hit the island in recent years. While Puerto Rico experiences very small earthquakes on a daily basis that no one feels, seismologists have said it\u2019s rare for bigger ones to strike the island.\n\nYahaida Zabala, a 46-year-old San Juan resident, was asleep when she felt her building sway Monday around 11:23 p.m.\n\n\u201cI rushed into my son\u2019s room,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was sitting like he was paralyzed.\u201d\n\nThey ran down the stairs of their building and stood outside with a small group of people awaiting aftershocks.\n\nThe last strong quake to shake the island in recent years occurred in January 2014, when a magnitude-6.4 tremor struck after midnight just north of the island\u2019s north coast at a depth of 17 miles (28 kilometers). Authorities reported broken windows, a busted water line and cracked floors and walls, along with some power outages. Some 70 aftershocks were reported afterward, with at least three of a magnitude 3.5 or greater.\n\nThe most damaging earthquake to hit Puerto Rico in recent history occurred in October 1918, when a magnitude-7.3 quake struck near the island\u2019s northwest coast, causing a tsunami and killing 116 people.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that name of San Juan resident is Yahaida Zabala.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck near Puerto Rico late Monday, rousing and scaring many from their sleep in the U.S. territory.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Danica Coto"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/28/puerto_rico_tropical_weather_68299_c0-313-3500-2353_s1770x1032.jpg?2f31f9e1f7171d541466b37888cb0ca557840e54", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
