We need the same measure of skill [to fix it],\" he said.\n\nJust this week, testimony at the state capture commission of inquiry from Hawks investigator Colonel Kobus Roelofse revealed that Crime Intelligence's secret service account was allegedly looted by officials for cars, the employment of unqualified family members and overseas trips.\n\nSouth Africa has been reeling over claims that some officials, including ministers and a former president, have been involved in corruption.\n\nBut there have been no major arrests and many have been putting pressure on the NPA to act.\n\nCriticism of judiciary\n\nSeveral political leaders, such as the EFF's Julius Malema and the ANC's Trevor Manuel, have recently criticised court rulings which were not in their favour.\n\nLamola also said that while some criticism against the judiciary was fair, there were concerns over repeated attacks against the judiciary.\n\nHe said this, coupled with calls for the death penalty, was an indication that the state the ANC-led government sought to build in the democratic dispensation had not taken form and that South Africans had not fully embodied the \"constitutional ethos\" of the country.\n\n\"The beneficiaries of state capture have to discredit an arm of the state to sustain a particular narrative because it is clear, unlike the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, there is no room to reconcile with those who derailed the liberation of our people,\" he said.\n\nLamola added that attacks on the courts can't be personal.\n\n\"Criticism cannot be a personal attack or degrading the rule of law,\" he said.", "description": "Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola says there won't be any reconciliation with those who have \"derailed\" the liberation of South Africa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9067/9191bcba6c454748838df52d46bf74e4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
