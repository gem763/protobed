It\u2019s a famously clandestine affair, with roads closed, checkpoints erected and burly security officers prowling every corner of the town. Still, it\u2019s no secret what subject will dominate this year\u2019s conclave after a startling escalation in the Asian superpower\u2019s trade war with the U.S.\n\nMarkets plunged this week after President Donald Trump vowed to slap 10% tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports\u2014including consumer goods like smartphones, toys and children\u2019s clothes\u2014from Sept. 1. This comes on top of the $250 billion he has already hit with 25% import taxes.\n\nThe escalation shocked Chinese officials who, not for the first time, believed negotiations were bearing fruit, especially since Trump had agreed a truce in late June. But rather than be cowed, China hit back Monday by slashing purchases of American soybeans to their lowest levels since 2004 and depreciating the national Renminbi currency by 1.4%, thereby lessening the blow of Trump\u2019s tariffs by making exports cheaper.\n\nIn response, the U.S. officially labeled China a currency manipulator and asked the IMF to \u201celiminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China\u2019s latest actions.\u201d Trump added his own salvo via Twitter: \u201cThis is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The American Chamber of Commerce in China released a statement saying, \u201ctariffs are paid by consumers and harm business.\u201d In a research note issued Aug. 5, Morgan Stanley economists warned that the higher U.S. tariffs and China\u2019s retaliation could mean the global economy heading for recession in just nine months. Unless sober heads prevail, the world may plunge into a crisis from which there will be no easy retreat.\n\nYet it\u2019s difficult to see an end to the stalemate. For three years now, Washington has repeatedly pushed for China to reform its state-dominated economy, which Trump claims flouts WTO rules and provides an unfair advantage on the global marketplace.\n\nBut that designation is unclear; WTO rules only covers export subsidies, which China\u2014officially, at least\u2014no longer uses. China does provide preferential loans and subsidies to domestic firms, but all countries do that. Just look at the $3 billion in tax cuts and other incentives Amazon was offered to relocate to New York City.\n\nChina also has high barriers for foreign firms to access strategic industries. But the U.S. does too, for example blocking Ant Financial\u2019s prospective purchase of MoneyGram among other sensitive acquisitions. There\u2019s zero sign that Trump is offering to match China in reforming the way each nation runs its economy. \u201cTrump is not really negotiating, he\u2019s just bullying, because negotiating usually means you have something to offer yourself on the table,\u201d says James H. Nolt, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute.\n\nThe lack of any discernible strategy in Trump\u2019s bluster has finally led Beijing to conclude that the trade war is simply a tool for domestic political purposes. China appears to be bedding down for a protracted conflict, believing, with some justification, that caving would just encourage more of the same volatile behavior. In May, China\u2019s strongman President Xi Jinping told a cheering crowd: \u201cWe are now embarking on a new Long March,\u201d referring to the CCP\u2019s fabled escape from Nationalist attacks in 1934-35. It\u2019s likely cadres at Beidaihe will be adopting a siege mentality.\n\nThis is not an isolated conflict, though. Trump has revived the use of trade as a political cudgel, one of the things the WTO was specifically created to stop. True, China must share some of the blame: it brazenly cuts tourists numbers to Taiwan, shutters South Korean-owned shopping malls and even delayed New Zealand seafood imports in response to political gripes. But the U.S. has ramped this up by unilaterally waging third party sanctions, such as its current campaign to censure any nation that does business with Iran. \u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented level of interference in world trade,\u201d says Nolt. \u201cI actually think China is more pro-free trade than the United States right now.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Tokyo and Seoul are also mired in their own bitter trade dispute over reparations for historic abuses during Japanese colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. In July, Japan restricted the sale of three key chemicals used in South Korea\u2019s vital microchip industry, provoking mass street protests and a boycott of Japanese goods like Toyota cars. Japan then retaliated by purging South Korea from a list of trusted trade partners.\n\nThe upshot is that the two strongest U.S. allies in East Asia are at loggerheads just as North Korea has resumed missile tests in earnest; on Tuesday, Pyongyang threatened a \u201cnew path\u201d if denuclearization talks remain stalled. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo belatedly tried to intervene to negotiate a truce between Seoul and Tokyo at an ASEAN security conference in Bangkok on Aug. 2. It achieved little other than foisting an extremely awkward photo op upon respective foreign ministers.\n\nThe reparations issue is nothing new, of course. It\u2019s festered for half-a-century, though was largely kept in check by regular, deft shuttle diplomacy by a U.S. cognizant of maintaining its regional bulwark against a resurgent China and belligerent North Korea. That Washington has stood by for over 18 months while relations between these key partners have so gravely deteriorated signals an administration \u201cnot equipped with either moral capacity or basic diplomatic agility,\u201d says Prof. Nick Bisley, an Asia expert at Australia\u2019s La Trobe University. \u201cIt\u2019s a terribly depressing sight.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s next for these trade wars? If China refuses to budge, Trump can either stick, fold or up the ante by further increasing tariffs or taking aim at key parts of China\u2019s economy. Chinese firms are preparing for technology decoupling to be ramped up, throwing out the possibility of an \u201cinnovation winter,\u201c according to analysis by Eurasia Group. If pushed into a corner, China could respond in kind by blacklisting American firms and even nationalizing U.S. assets in China. This would be the \u201cdoomsday scenario,\u201d says Bisley. But with Trump tweeting Tuesday that he\u2019d \u201cdo it again next year if necessary\u201d in order to protect American farmers, the looming crisis is a reality the world might have to face up to soon.\n\nWrite to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com.", "description": "Unless sober heads prevail, the world may plunge into a crisis from which there will be no easy retreat", "authors": ["Charlie Campbell"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/trade_war_china_u.s._stalemate.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1"}
