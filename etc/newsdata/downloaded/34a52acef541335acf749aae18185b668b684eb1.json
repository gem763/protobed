This seemed to please the president, who retweeted more than 20 tweets about the exchange.\n\nOne referred to another Fox News anchor whose coverage of the Ukraine scandal has stoked turmoil at the network: \u201cCan we face off Levin and worlds [sic] worst anchor Chris Wallace?\u201d\n\nOthers included: \u201cMark Levin ripped Ed Henry a new one\u201d and \u201cMark Levin sure put that lying shit head Ed Henry in his place didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nIn less vulgar fashion, the president also relayed a message from @TBASharks.\n\nThe account is a bot, full title Trump But About Sharks, which explains its mission thus: \u201cTrump apparently hates sharks, so this bot does some word replacement on his tweets to make them about sharks.\u201d\n\nThe message retweeted by the president therefore read: \u201cRT @BulldawgDerek @foxandfriends A Sunday Morning; Amen Mark Levin, Preach Brother! You shut down Ed Henry and the Pro Shark Media with the fac[ts]\u201d.\n\nThe original tweet, which Trump also retweeted, referred to \u201cthe fake news\u201d, a common target for Trump if not usually including hosts of Fox & Friends.\n\nThe tweet in question. Photograph: Twitter\n\nTrump\u2019s fear and dislike of sharks is well established. In 2013, two years before he emerged Jaws-like from the depths to savage the body politic, he tweeted: \u201cSharks are last on my list \u2013 other than perhaps the losers and haters of the world!\u201d\n\nIn 2018, the adult film maker and actor Stormy Daniels revealed that during the brief affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006 \u2013 which he denies \u2013 he enthused about a TV special about a shipwreck.\n\n\u201cIt was like the worst shark attack in history,\u201d said Daniels. \u201cHe is obsessed with sharks. Terrified of sharks.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u201cI donate to all these charities and I would never donate to any charity that helps sharks. I hope all the sharks die.\u2019 He was like riveted. He was like obsessed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so strange, I know.\u201d", "description": "President retweeted more than 20 tweets about the exchange between host Ed Henry and radio host Mark Levin", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b100861aef8b886880e1008ce7cd3f7c14ac831e/0_54_1470_882/master/1470.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff39b947f22b2ad30ea01e589047c849", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
