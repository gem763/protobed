Well, not quite literally. But the 19-year-old blue-haired musician better known as Beabadoobee takes us on a journey through her sonic solar system, replete with roaring guitars and big drums. The EP (which was released on October 14) is the artist\u2019s fourth in two years and contains some of Bea\u2019s most expansive work yet \u2014 though with a full length already in the works, she\u2019s moving right along. The new \u201cfull on, super hyped songs\u201d pay tribute to 90s indie rock stars like Kim Gordon and Stephen Malkmus, who guide Beabadoobee on her interstellar mission.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically the music I\u2019ve always wanted to make. All of my inspiration, who I am as a person, and who I aspire to be really influenced this EP,\u201d Bea says over the phone, as she\u2019s getting ready for her first US tour with Clairo. \u201cI just let myself go and wanted every song to be a song that people can jump to.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all quite impressive given that the Filipino-British artist only started playing guitar about two years ago. Bea took violin lessons for seven years and wrote simple songs in school, but never imagined a musical career \u2014 let alone even singing her own songs herself \u2014 until her dad brought home a second hand guitar one day to cheer her up. Bea couldn\u2019t put it down. Aged 17, the first song she learned was \u201cKiss Me\u201d by Sixpence None the Richer and not long after, it inspired her to write \u201cCoffee\u201d with a similar chord progression.\n\nPhoto by Jordan Curtis Hughes.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was kind of bored. I didn\u2019t know what to do with my life and I had so much feeling. I didn\u2019t know how to express it any other way except expressing it through music,\u201d Bea explains. \u201cI was really stressed about what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do\u2026 Music was the only thing that was really fun doing.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to being a teenager trying to find her way in the world, Bea had been kicked out of her Catholic school and had a lot of time on her hands. She began uploading her tracks online under her finsta name, Beabadoobee, and never expected much to come of it: \u201cI was like, \u2018No one gives a shit, I\u2019ll just call it some random name...\u2019 I never really saw it picking up or saw people liking my music.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the intimate acoustic track \u201cCoffee\u201d went viral on YouTube almost overnight and her hazy, hushed vocals earned her mention as one to watch among bedroom pop artists. \u201cI never thought that was going to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, it just did. People started to like [my music] and I started to fall in love with it even more.\u201d\n\nThough she still makes music in her West London room, which is lovingly covered in photos of a young Tom Hanks, she quickly outgrew the bedroom pop genre to become the next indie rock wunderkind. Beabadoobee was signed to Dirty Hit, home to The 1975 and The Japanese House, and she released her first two EPs Lice and Patched Up in 2018. Not to mention a cover of \u201cThe Moon Song\u201d by Karen O. Beabadoobee\u2019s earlier releases are largely inspired by Elliot Smith, The Moldy Peaches, and Daniel Johnston, but for her third EP Loveworm (2019) Bea took it to the next level by adding a full band with bassist Eliana Sewell and Louis Semlekan-Faith on drums.\n\n\u201cIt happened quickly, but then within the quickness of it all I released a lot of music...It still feels really overwhelming. I just finished school and stuff,\u201d Bea says, having only completed exams at her new school last June. \u201cWhen I got into the studio and could record everything properly and got a band, that\u2019s when it all became exciting. It feels so cool. It just feels like a dream.\u201d\n\nWhen we meet for ice cream just days before her debut New York show, the fact that she\u2019s touring the country hadn\u2019t even set in yet. \u201cI haven\u2019t prepared myself for any of this. I just write a shit ton of songs. I would have never thought that I\u2019d be doing gigs or going on tour,\u201d Bea says later. \u201cNow it just seems so real and now I\u2019m in America!\u201d\n\nThough Bea is particularly worried that her American fans won\u2019t know how to mosh. \u201cI think Londoners have some crackhead energy when they mosh,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cThey want to throw themselves across the pit.\u201d However, the raucous crowd at Chelsea Music Hall on September 27 proves themselves, singing Bea\u2019s lyrics right back at her. Perhaps most notably when she launches into \u201cShe Plays Bass\u201d and \u201cI wish I Was Stephen Malkmus,\u201d two standout songs on Space Cadet.\n\n\u201cA space cadet basically means an individual who\u2019s just very weird and strange\u2026,\u201d Bea says, explaining the EP\u2019s title. \u201cI feel like a space cadet sometimes. I think everyone does. It\u2019s okay to feel out of place. It\u2019s never a bad thing. I always have to tell myself that.\u201d\n\nOtherworldly references occur both literally and figuratively on Space Cadet, in her lyrics and arrangements, centering the universe as Bea\u2019s main source of inspiration. \u201cI was always curious about it. I wanted to find out more,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just vast. It\u2019s massive. You have no idea what\u2019s in it! It\u2019s so terrifying.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s much more than that. Through these songs Bea is trying to make sense of her own journey, which has been quite unpredictable, all the while fearlessly hurtling forward through space. She tackles her anxieties, her fears, and feelings of being misunderstood head on. \u201cWriting this EP helped me with my anxiety a lot and it helped me explore myself as a musician, with different instruments, different sounds,\u201d Bea says. \u201cI hope it helps people with theirs too.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Jordan Curtis Hughes.\n\nOn \u201cAre You Sure,\u201d Bea explores her own mind, her way of thinking, and ruminates on the fact that sometimes not everyone gets it. And that\u2019s perfectly fine. \u201cI wrote \u2018Are You Sure\u2019 with a lot of anger, but I think it\u2019s my favorite song. It sounds lyrically sad and angry, but it\u2019s very cool,\u201d Bea says. \u201cWe tripled the guitars and it sounds huge. With the chords and production, I wanted it to sway from what you expected into a completely different route for just a second, like \u2018Oh that\u2019s a bit strange,\u2019 then you get back.\u201d\n\nThough it\u2019s the title track that is without a doubt the \u201cmost space-y one\u201d of all, boasting a playful melody and a guitar part that \u201csounds kind of like a spaceship going in and out in the background.\u201d Chronologically, the song was written first and the lyrics are a bit nonsensical at times, as Bea sings of \u201cextraterrestrial beings\u201d and \u201ca candy floss made spacecraft.\u201d But most importantly, a place where she can escape: \u201cthrough the Milky Way/ past the morning sun/ Pluto is lightyears away/ and all our worries they\u2019re all gone.\u201d", "description": "On her new EP \u2018Space Cadet\u2019 the 19-year old musician takes us on a journey through her sonic solar system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da9cfa928a0ce000a3365d7/lede/1571412437513-Beabadoobee_SpaceCadetArtwork_0004_JH.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8409745065789473xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
