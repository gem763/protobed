The 35-year-old right-hander has a 4-0 record and 0.95 ERA in four career playoff elimination starts, including last week\u2019s wild-card win against the Oakland A\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just what Charlie\u2019s done all year,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s got that knack for doing some special things for us, and he did it again.\u201d\n\nThe Astros jumped out to a 1-0 lead after a solo home run by Jose Altuve in the first. Kiermaier\u2019s three-run shot put the Rays ahead 3-1 before Ji-Man Choi and Brandon Lowe added solo home runs off Greinke, who has never won in Tampa Bay, in the next two innings to make it 5-1.\n\nAustin Meadows plated two more with a double in the bottom of the fourth. Rays designated hitter Tommy Pham then scored Meadows with a single to right field, extending Tampa Bay\u2019s lead to 8-1.\n\nGreinke was pulled after 61 pitches. He allowed six earned runs on five hits and struck out five across 3 2/3 innings.\n\nAstros first baseman Yuli Gurriel trimmed the lead to 8-3 with a two-RBI single in the sixth. Rays shortstop Willy Adames answered with a solo home run in the bottom of the sixth and Travis d\u2019Arnaud scored Avisail Garcia on a sacrifice fly in the seventh to seal the win.\n\nGame 4 of the best-of-five series is scheduled for Tuesday at Tropicana Field. The Astros will send Justin Verlander to the mound against Rays opener Diego Castillo.", "description": "Oct. 7 (UPI) \u2014 The Tampa Bay Rays had an offensive explosion against Zack Greinke and cut their deficit to 2-1 in their AL Division Series with a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
