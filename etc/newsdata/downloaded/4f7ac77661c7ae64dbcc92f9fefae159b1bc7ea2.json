This one\u2019s going to be a ride.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nLet\u2019s start with the scoreboard, that cold, pitiless tally of futility. Ten runs. Ten runs! In the first (censored) inning! How does that even happen?\n\nIt happened the way Hemingway described how bankruptcy happens: gradually, and then suddenly. The Cardinals played a bit of small ball to start the game \u2014 get \u2018em on, get \u2018em over, get \u2018em in \u2014 but before long, they were racing around the bases like Olympians running laps.\n\nMike Foltynewicz \u2014 born the day after the Worst-to-First Braves clinched the National League West way back in 1991 \u2014 lasted exactly 23 pitches, lofting up batting-practice beach balls that the Cardinals laced to every angle of the field like they were using laser pointers. They broke Folty, and they broke his replacement, Max Fried, tagging them for a combined seven hits and 11 runs over two innings.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, the Cardinals had posted the best first inning in playoff history, and had tied the mark for best postseason inning ever. Since the deluge came before the Braves even got a chance to swing a bat \u2014 Atlanta got one pity run on a Josh Donaldson homer in the fourth \u2014 you could make a convincing statistical argument that this was, for the home team, literally the worst half-inning of postseason baseball ever played.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat\u2019s going to leave a mark that won\u2019t go away for years.\n\nIf there\u2019s any solace Braves fans can take, this was like getting your arm lopped off with one stroke of a sharp axe, rather than getting it gnawed off by a badger. Thank heaven for small comforts.\n\nOn a broader scale, The Most Brutal Half-Inning Beatdown In Baseball History happened because this city is flat-out cursed. It\u2019s true. You know the numbers: one championship in more than 170 seasons across the four major sports. Two teams fled, three others flail.\n\nOzzie Albies and Dansby Swanson know the end is near. (Getty)\n\nRead this stat and tell me there\u2019s no curse: The Falcons, as you may have heard, blew a 28-3 lead in the Super Bowl. Game 5 happened two years, eight months and three days after that Super Bowl collapse. This city doesn\u2019t avoid Fate; oh no, Fate owns a nice piece of property and an SUV in the Atlanta suburbs, all the better to pay visits to the local teams every year.\n\nSure, other teams have ghosts. Blown saves, walk-off losses, heartbreaking errors. But the Braves? The Braves, my friend, have a cemetery. Those 19 postseason pennants since 1991 adorning light posts above right field? Those aren\u2019t honors, man. Those are tombstones.\n\nLook, kids! There\u2019s 1991, where Lonnie Smith ran the Braves right out of a possible World Series Game 7 win! Check out 1996, where Mark Wohlers hung a slider that Jim Leyritz hit so hard that the Braves haven\u2019t won a World Series game since! Or hey, how about 2001, where the Braves ran into the pitching firestorm of Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling \u2026 and haven\u2019t won a postseason SERIES since! Scoot a little down the line and there\u2019s 2010, where Brooks Conrad committed three errors in one NLDS game! And then there\u2019s 2012, where an \u201cinfield\u201d fly that dropped somewhere north of Alpharetta cost the Braves a chance against these same Cardinals. So many memories!\n\nLord. They need to sink the 2019 banner in the depths of Lake Lanier and never speak of this season ever again.\n\nAfter the game, with the scent of cheap Champagne from the Cardinals\u2019 locker room wafting down SunTrust Park\u2019s back hallways, the Braves\u2019 postgame clubhouse was funeral-home quiet, the only sound the pop of backslaps and hugs as players embraced one another and said their goodbyes. Tarps that would have been unrolled for a Champagne celebration \u2014 the first in 18 years \u2014 remained curled up atop the lockers.\n\nNobody broke any chairs. Nobody shouted any curses. They\u2019d all had, in effect, three hours to process the thrashing, so the emotional wounds weren\u2019t quite so raw. But the enormity of what they faced after that first inning \u2014 a mountain, dropped right there in your path \u2014 well, they were still struggling to come to terms with that.\n\n\u201cStuff happens fast,\u201d Foltynewicz said. \u201cIt seemed like I was just trying to make my pitches as best I could and it just went the wrong way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you,\u201d said Adam Duvall, who saw his NLDS MVP vanish along with the Braves\u2019 season. \u201c I go into the dugout and I still think we have a chance to win. We have nine innings of baseball left, nine innings of offense left. We were talking about, \u2018let\u2019s do something that\u2019s never been done before.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know we had a good enough team to win the whole thing,\u201d said Freeman, answering every question with a single sentence. \u201cThis is a tough one because we had a really good group.\u201d\n\nBlaming the players is the obvious route here \u2014 Freeman, for instance, could have held the Cardinals to one run in the first had he not misplayed Yadier Molina\u2019s liner, and he knew it \u2014 but in another way, it\u2019s like blaming a swimmer for getting thrown around by the tide. This is bigger than any player, bigger than any season, bigger than any one team.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in the moment,\u201d McCann said. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to get outs and you\u2019re trying to \u2026\u201d His voice trailed off, but with good reason; he had other things on his mind, announcing his retirement just moments later.\n\n\u201cI went to high school here. I grew up here. I got to play nine years to start my career here,\u201d McCann said. \u201cI grew up with some of my heroes growing up, and got to come back and play with the new generation. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a success.\u201d\n\nMcCann\u2019s the latest in a line of (now) retired Braves stretching back from Chipper Jones to John Smoltz to Tom Glavine to Dale Murphy, bound by both the uniform and the utter, relentless, no-hope-on-the-horizon frustration of being a Brave. It\u2019s almost enough to make you think this team and this town are, well, cursed.\n\nA few lockers away from McCann, Dansby Swanson brushed off that idea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a curse,\u201d he said, and nothing more.\n\nYou\u2019ll forgive me if I don\u2019t believe him.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. Right when you\u2019re ready to take bulldozers and jackhammers to Atlanta\u2019s glittery new stadiums, fire all those high-priced corporate seats into the sun, and salt the earth so that no team ever hurts this battered, broken city again \u2026\n\n\u2026 right at that moment, you look around and you see the tiniest slivers of hope.\n\nBraves fans spent most of the 1990s and 2000s getting waves of grief from the national media for not showing up to playoff games. There were extenuating circumstances, of course \u2014 traffic, terrible first-pitch scheduling \u2014 but the heart of the issue was that fans were already sick of October failure. Your heart can\u2019t be broken if you don\u2019t give it away.\n\nWednesday night, though, these fans did something remarkable \u2014 they stuck around. The stadium was still at least three-quarters full late into the game. And as they were leaving, the mood in the crowd was \u2014 well, it wasn\u2019t \u201chappiness,\u201d exactly, but it wasn\u2019t the slow march to the grave that I\u2019ve seen after so many other Atlanta postseason losses. (Trust me. I\u2019ve seen a lot of them.) Children laughed. Bros whooped. The sun would rise again tomorrow, and on the 2020 season soon enough.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s how you take this team: for what it is at any given moment, not for what it could be at the end of the year. You enjoy Freddie Freeman\u2019s clock-punching professionalism and Ronald Acuna\u2019s this-is-all-a-game attitude, you cheer for whichever young phenom steps up and slings some gorgeous heat in every warm month, and you steel yourself as Labor Day rolls around, knowing that like Christmas Day and summer breaks and birthday parties, this is all going to end so much faster than you\u2019d like.\n\nPlus, owning the worst collapses in the history of two different sports \u2026 well, at least that\u2019s something.\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
