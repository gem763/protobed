The Economist gleefully saw \u201cthe end of populism\u201d in his surprise electoral success. A 2016 segment on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d showed Macri with his young daughter and fashion designer wife, Juliana Awada, and dreamily observed that \u201cyou can\u2019t help but think of the Kennedys and Camelot.\u201d\n\nIn Washington \u2014 where suspicion of left-wing politics further to the south is a multigenerational, bipartisan tradition \u2014 experts mused at the time about the waning of the Latin American left and a new free-market-friendly zeitgeist reshaping the region. They placed Macri\u2019s rise at the start of a broader rightward shift: In 2016, left-wing Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, and in Peru, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former International Monetary Fund economist, was elected president. In 2017, Harvard-educated millionaire Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era returned to power in Chile. In 2018, U.S.-educated Colombian conservative Iv\u00e1n Duque won the presidency. By the beginning of this year, Ecuadoran President Len\u00edn Moreno had initiated a major move away from his demagogic predecessor Rafael Correa\u2019s leftist interventionist policies. Brazil\u2019s current president, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right nationalist who raged against the region\u2019s left on the campaign trail, was inaugurated in January amid investor hopes that he would loosen regulations and privatize swaths of Brazil\u2019s public sector.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTambi\u00e9n hoy cumple a\u00f1os mi amigo @LulaOficial, un hombre extraordinario que est\u00e1 injustamente preso desde hace un a\u00f1o y medio.\n\n\n\nParab\u00e9ns pra voc\u00ea, querido Lula. Espero verte pronto. #LulaLivre pic.twitter.com/PiRE931CxS \u2014 Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez (@alferdez) October 27, 2019\n\nBut the political map looks vastly different now in the shadow of Macri\u2019s defeat. A bribery scandal forced the 2018 resignation of Kuczynski, who was placed in pretrial detention in April as prosecutors prepare corruption charges against him. (Peru, meanwhile, is gripped by a constitutional crisis, with the country\u2019s current president having dissolved an opposition-dominated legislature that voted to suspend his rule.) Bolsonaro has had a tumultuous first year in office and finds himself increasingly politically isolated. Fern\u00e1ndez himself earlier branded Bolsonaro as \u201cracist, misogynist and violent\u201d and tweeted on Sunday his support for imprisoned leftist former Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.\n\nEarlier this month, mass protests in Ecuador against an unpopular package of austerity measures saw Moreno temporarily relocate his government away from the capital, Quito. He ultimately agreed to reverse his decision to scrap billions of dollars in fuel subsidies, risking a major IMF loan. Indigenous leaders at the heart of the uprising cast their struggle as a battle against neoliberalism, the laissez faire economic creed many on the continent still associate with years of Cold War-era dictatorships and American political meddling.\n\nIn Chile, the largest protests in a generation saw more than a million people take to the streets of Santiago on Friday. The spur of the demonstrations was an increase in subway prices, which catalyzed widespread anger at the deep inequities in Chilean society. Clashes between security forces and protesters left at least 17 people dead, stoked the flames of unrest, and deepened the protesters\u2019 demands for wholesale change. In a bid to ease tensions, Pi\u00f1era enacted a sweeping cabinet reshuffle and promised a suite of reforms, including increases in the minimum wage and pensions. But that didn\u2019t stop new bonfires from raging in city streets on Monday, with a fresh round of demonstrations slated for Tuesday.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nChile\u2019s upheaval has prompted calls for a new social contract in a society that outside observers have long viewed as one of the more stable in Latin America. Even politicians in Pi\u00f1era\u2019s government recognize the need for a fuller national dialogue. Some protesters cast their revolt as the unfinished business of reckoning with the dictatorial legacy of U.S.-backed general Augusto Pinochet. \u201cOur constitution today is the heritage of neoliberalism in Chile, dating back to Pinochet,\u201d said Isidora Cepeda Beccar, a political activist in the Chilean capital, in an interview with the left-wing U.S. publication Jacobin. \u201cTo change things fundamentally we need to cut those roots. We need to create new rules of the game.\u201d\n\nLa dictadura cort\u00f3 tus manos, V\u00edctor Jara, y hoy #Chile toca y corea tus canciones. #ChileDesperto #NoMasNeoliberalismo. \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1\ud83d\udc9c\ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\udf2a pic.twitter.com/bhUe8RLTKM \u2014 \u00c9rika Ortega Sanoja (@ErikaOSanoja) October 26, 2019\n\nIn Argentina, the anti-neoliberal uprising came in the form of the ballot box. But it\u2019s unclear how Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 a less polarizing figure than Kirchner \u2014 will drag his country out of the morass. \u201cVoters had to choose between two failures,\u201d Federico Finchelstein, an Argentine historian at the New School for Social Research in New York City, told Today\u2019s WorldView, pointing to both the dead end of Macri\u2019s approach and the missteps of his more populist predecessors.\n\nRicardo Kirschbaum, editor in chief of the leading Buenos Aires daily Clarin, suggested that the new president may have to look across the Atlantic for inspiration. Fern\u00e1ndez takes as \u201chis lodestar the case of Portugal: from 2014 onward, social democrats ruling in a coalition with the Communist Party pulled that country out of a deep recession, one that was similarly induced by the austerity measures put in place by a conservative government working in conjunction with the European Central Bank, the IMF, and the European Union,\u201d Kirschbaum wrote in Foreign Affairs. \u201cLike his Portuguese counterpart, Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa, Fern\u00e1ndez counsels a move away from austerity and a return to protectionism.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhatever comes, Macri\u2019s own political star has plummeted. Far from a regional trendsetter, he became politically radioactive in the final period of his presidency, weighing down the challenges of right-wing politicians elsewhere. \u201cIn Bolivia, Macri\u2019s likely departure is thought to strengthen [left-wing President] Evo Morales in the campaign against center-right moderate Carlos Mesa,\u201d wrote Brazil-based political scientist Oliver Stuenkel in Americas Quarterly last week. \u201cIn Uruguay, which elects a new president later this month, the center-right candidate Lacalle Pou sought to distance himself from Macri.\u201d\n\nWhatever ails the continent\u2019s sluggish economies and polarized societies, mild-mannered center-right politicians like Macri can\u2019t muster a response. We may see, as Stuenkel suggests, \u201cmore economically liberal candidates joining illiberal nationalist forces, as happened in Brazil.\u201d\n\nBut even Bolsonaro\u2019s political experiment is a fragile one and could face a similarly angry backlash if he fails to deliver on his economic promises. \u201cWe will see to what extent this will last for Bolsonaro, who seems to be the true heir of Pinochet,\u201d said Finchelstein. \u201cEventually Brazilians may reject him, too.\u201d\n\nWant smart analysis of the most important news in your inbox every weekday, along with other global reads, interesting ideas and opinions?
