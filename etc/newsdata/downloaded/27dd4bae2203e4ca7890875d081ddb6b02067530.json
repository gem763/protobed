Leipzig is unpopular among rival fans due to its fast ascent financed since its foundation by energy drinks manufacturer Red Bull.\n\nNagelsmann is used to the animosity. Former club Hoffenheim was also unpopular due to its financial reliance on billionaire backer Dietmar Hopp, though not to the level of Leipzig, which has became a favored target for rival fans.\n\nNagelsmann has compared himself to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, saying it took three years for Klopp to win titles at Borussia Dortmund and then Liverpool.\n\nHis goal is to do the same at Leipzig,\n\n\u201cThree years would be fine for all of us or even sooner. Four years would also be OK. Anyway, it would be great to do it and that\u2019s my aim,\u201d Nagelsmann said.\n\nHe can approach Saturday\u2019s game relaxed knowing he has been given time to settle in at Leipzig.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to be nervous when there are one or two defeats,\u201d Leipzig chairman Oliver Mintzlaff said before the season. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s a new start and that there\u2019s a certain settling in period as things adjust.\u201d\n\nBayern counterpart Niko Kovac has had no such luxury, being under constant pressure since he took over the Bavarian powerhouse last year. Kovac had to dampen speculation over his future in the run up to Bayern\u2019s 3-0 win over Leipzig in the German Cup final, and will be expected to do better after winning the league and cup double last season.\n\nBayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who has been openly critical of Kovac at times, says he welcomes the competition that Leipzig has brought to the league.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always interested in competition for Bayern, because competition provides football with excitement and emotion. Leipzig is definitely one of the clubs that will establish itself at the top of the Bundesliga,\u201d Rummenigge told Kicker magazine on Thursday.\n\nBut not just yet, he hopes.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to take over the league-lead with a win,\u201d Rummenigge said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fast-rising Leipzig is betting on new coach Julian Nagelsmann to provide the edge it needs to finally end Bayern Munich's Bundesliga hegemony.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/germany_soccer_bundesliga_34100_c61-0-2849-1626_s1770x1032.jpg?7f3a9c503cfc59efcc5af7a19ae8ab83c32c20ee", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
