I am aware of zero evidence, from anyone, that any of the private-server emails ever had a damaging impact on U.S. security or national interest. Every candidate has his or her flaws and mistakes; these were among hers. They could be handled by \u201cnormal\u201d press means.\n\nBut because the instinct toward structural balance is so powerful in the press\u2014and because several institutions, notably NPR and The New York Times, seem so hyperaware of the criticism they receive for having a \u201cliberal bias\u201d\u2014much of the press presented things that were not similar as if they were. For instance, on the one hand, there were deals and donations that could \u201craise questions\u201d about the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton\u2019s own business life. On the other hand, Donald Trump flat-out refused to release his tax returns or any honest information about his business deals, so the press and public could not get even to the \u201craise questions\u201d stage.\n\nOn the merits, Donald Trump\u2019s finances were a hundred times as suspicious as those of other candidates, and his statements about anything were a hundred times as likely to be false. But it went against the nature of most news organizations to run a hundred times as many articles about his lies and shadiness as his opponents\u2019. Or even twice as many. By the time of the general election, it seemed \u201cfairest\u201d and most comfortable to aim for something more like 50-50.\n\nWhen it came to Hillary Clinton, the clearest manifestation of that was vast over-coverage of \u201cher emails,\u201d most famously exemplified in this front page of The New York Times, 10 days before the election:\n\nJames Comey, when big-footing his way into the final stage of the election, expected that Hillary Clinton was on her way to victory. No doubt the Times\u2019s editors must have thought the same, and that they were showing their tough-mindedness about her. But the result is what people mean by \u201cfalse equivalence.\u201d Two things that were different\u2014the weaknesses of each candidate\u2014were presented as if they were similar.\n\nAs an Atlantic colleague puts it: Journalism is hard; criticizing journalism is easy. In this business we\u2019re all doing our best, and we all make mistakes in real time. But the very difficulty of these calls is why it\u2019s worth noting a similar, as-if-we\u2019d-learned-nothing-from-2016 case of false equivalence, which is unfolding before our eyes.
