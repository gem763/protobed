That is where the U.S.-based fear would come from,\" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nThe tariff-sensitive Philadelphia semiconductor index <.SOX> extended its decline after the reports and ended down 2.4% on the day. The index was already under pressure from Micron Technology Inc's <MU.O>, which tumbled after it forecast a disappointing first-quarter profit.\n\nThe S&P technology index <.SPLRCT> dropped 1.3%. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd <BABA.N>, Baidu Inc <BIDU.O> and JD.com Inc <JD.O> all slid.\n\nAdding to the negative momentum in afternoon trade, the S&P 500 index briefly fell below its 50-day moving average.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 70.87 points, or 0.26%, to 26,820.25, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 15.83 points, or 0.53%, to 2,961.79 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 91.03 points, or 1.13%, to 7,939.63.\n\nAll three indexes ended lower for the week as well, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq registering their biggest weekly percentage drops since August. The Cboe volatility index <.VIX> ended at a three-week high.\n\nShares of Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N> rose 3.8% and the stock was the top gainer in the S&P 500 after the lender named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer.\n\nData early in the day showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in August, suggesting that the economy's main growth engine was slowing after accelerating sharply in the second quarter.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.94-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 6 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 118 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.68 billion shares, compared to the 7.2 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Sinead Carew in New York and Ambar Warrick and Medha Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Chizu Nomiyama and Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "", "authors": ["Caroline Valetkevitch"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z0FtTtUH.E6jnNKzEIEHRA--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/3f709b7350d05729438755ddaf106b37", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
