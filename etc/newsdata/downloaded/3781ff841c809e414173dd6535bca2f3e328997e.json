CGC, +6.37% WEED, +6.17% came to $484.4 million. It also recognized $46 million of charges related to cost cutting.\n\nThat pushed its net loss to $525.2 million, or $2.52 a share, for the quarter to Aug. 31, after income of $1.149 billion, or $5.41 a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding those charges, the company had per-share earnings of $2.72, ahead of the $2.63 FactSet consensus.\n\nSales edged up 2% to $2.344 billion, matching the FactSet consensus.\n\nConstellation Brands has made no secret of its frustration with its cannabis investment, a move that propelled Canopy to the top of the sector, measured by market capitalization. The company acquired its 35% stake in the company late last year at a time when the cannabis sector was flying high.\n\nRead now: Shoppers will opt for slower shipping or in-store pickup during the holiday season to fight climate change\n\nBut by summer, frustrated by the Smith Falls, Ontario-based company\u2019s mounting losses, Chief Executive William Newlands expressed his impatience on a conference call with analysts.\n\nRead: Canopy Growth\u2019s remaining CEO talks about pot company\u2019s shake-up, and the search for his replacement\n\n\u201cWhile we remain happy with our investment in the cannabis space and its long-term potential, we were not pleased with Canopy\u2019s recent reported year-end results,\u201d Newlands told analysts. \u201cHowever, we continue to aggressively support Canopy on a more focused long-term strategy to win markets and form factors that matter, while paving a clear path to profitability.\u201d\n\nThat displeasure led the company to push out Bruce Linton as co-CEO of Canopy, a move that shocked the industry when it was announced in July. Linton was widely viewed as the face of legal cannabis, given his status as head of the biggest company in the space and his frequent media appearances and interviews.\n\nIn May, Constellation Brands appointed Mike Lee, a former senior vice president and chief financial officer, as Canopy\u2019s interim CFO, tasked with overhauling the company\u2019s strategy.\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s conference call with analysts, Newlands softened his tone on Canopy.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re pleased with the progress of the Canopy team and what they have done in the last few months,\u201d he told analysts according to a FactSet transcript. The team is developing a range of CBD products and marketing plans, and is securing the resources to bring them to the U.S.\n\nNewlands welcomed the recent House vote in favor of a bill that would protect banks that serve the cannabis industry from federal enforcement and said he was looking forward to Cannabis 2.0 in Canada, the launch of derivative products that is expected in December.\n\nThe CEO said the company is now betting on another relatively new trend, the hard Seltzer, or alcoholic carbonated drink. Constellation is planning to launch a Corona-branded Seltzer, building on that brand\u2019s popularity with Hispanic and other drinkers.\n\n\u201cThe refreshment characteristics of Seltzer perfectly matche(s) Corona refreshment DNA,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that seltzers are here to stay and will therefore accelerate the volume shift into the category from the low-end and to the high-end where we are the market share leader.\u201d\n\nThe company is planning four flavors of the drink, including tropical wine, mango, cherry and blackberry lime. The brand will have just 90 calories with zero carbs and zero sugars, he said.\n\nCannabis Watch: For all of MarketWatch\u2019s coverage of cannabis companies\n\nRead now: Cannabis companies are having a horrible summer as scandals mount and stocks slide\n\nConstellation Brands said beer sales rose to $1.640 billion from $1.527 billion in the second quarter. But wine and spirit sales fell to $703.6 million from $772.0 million, as shipment volumes fell to 14.4 million 9-liter case equivalents from 16.0 million.\n\nThe wine and spirits performance \u201ccontinues to be impacted by transition activities with distributors who are repositioning for ownership of brands upon close of the pending transaction with E.J. Gallo,\u201d the company said. E.J. Gallo has agreed to buy about 30 of Constellation\u2019s wine and spirits brands in a deal valued at $1.7 billion\n\nThe company tweaked its guidance and said it now expects EPS of 55 cents to 75 cents and adjusted EPS of $9.00 to $9.20, down from last year\u2019s $9.28. The guidance assumes that the wine and spirits deal will close at the end of the third quarter, along with a separate deal to divest its Black Velvet Canadian whisky to Heaven Hill Brands for $266 million.\n\nSee also: Why the alcohol-free movement is becoming fashionable\n\nMKM Partners analyst Bill Kirk said the numbers were a little short of what was needed to push the stock off its summer lows, but said his bullish thesis remains intact.\n\n\u201cThe unrelenting strength, and resulting cash generation, of Modelo affords Constellation the flexibility to invest in innovation, adjacent industries and marketing,\u201d he wrote in a note to clients, reiterating his buy rating on the stock.\n\n\u201cMost of its peers are facing the opposite: declining volumes and a P&L under fixed cost pressures forcing a tightening of the investment belt.\u201d\n\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog, also a bull with an outperform rating on the stock, said the company outperformed her expectations, thanks to strong beer sales.\n\nSee: This might be why millennials are drinking more. (Hint: they\u2019re short and loud)\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re confident in STZ\u2019s premium positioning in beer/wine and, ultimately, hard seltzer,\u201d she wrote in a note to clients. \u201cShares looked to be pressured initially on the headline EPS decline, but that was well-telegraphed as we move through this \u201cretrenchment year.\u201d Therefore, we would be buyers on weakness.\u201d\n\nConstellation shares have fallen 9% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.80% has fallen 2.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47% has fallen 3.9%.", "description": "Constellation Brands Inc. stock fell 7% Thursday to lead S&P 500 decliners, after the distributor of Corona beer swung to a big loss in its fiscal second...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS583_Conste_ZG_20191003103518.jpg"}
