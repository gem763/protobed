Roughly 2.4 trillion cigarettes were sold in the country last year, almost all of them made by China National Tobacco, or CNTC. That\u2019s roughly three times the number sold by Philip Morris International , PM -0.87% the world\u2019s largest non-Chinese tobacco company. U.S. leader Altria , MO -1.15% which last week disclosed merger talks with Philip Morris, sold just 110 billion.\n\nThe Chinese market is also shrinking at a relatively gentle pace by global standards. Cigarette sales fell 4.9% over the five years through 2018, compared to a world average of 9% and double-digit declines in mature markets like the U.S. and Japan, according to Euromonitor International. And because of higher prices, revenue in China actually grew 10% over the period.\n\nshare your thoughts What does the future hold for the cigarette market? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe problem for investors is that only the Chinese state benefits from this lucrative business. CNTC is a state-owned monopoly that controls the production and sale of cigarettes in the country. Foreign companies have to license their brands to CNTC to gain access, but so far their sales amount to a rounding error. Philip Morris, for example, only has 0.1% of the market, according to Euromonitor.\n\nThe tobacco industry contributed 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) to the Chinese government\u2019s coffers last year, which is equivalent to around 6% of total tax revenue. The government doesn\u2019t have a strong incentive to introduce anti-smoking campaigns that might choke off such a significant revenue source.\n\nInvestors were excited to get their hands on part of this state monopoly when China Tobacco International, a subsidiary of CNTC, went public in Hong Kong in June. Shares of the company have more than quadrupled the initial offer price.\n\nBut China Tobacco International is a very poor proxy for the Chinese cigarette industry. It doesn\u2019t sell cigarettes in China, the most lucrative part of the group. Instead, it mainly imports and exports tobacco leaves. Although it has exclusive rights over this activity, the business doesn\u2019t sit in the walled garden of a state monopoly and is subject to all manner of global pressures. The company\u2019s net profit for the first half, announced last Monday, fell 30% from a year ago, mainly because of the trade war with the U.S., where around 30% of the company\u2019s tobacco leaves were sourced last year.\n\nThe stock has fallen 17% since the results announcement, but is still valued at 52 times forward earnings.\n\nIt is time investors quit.\n\nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com", "description": "Cigarette sales are holding up better in China than in many markets, but that\u2019s no reason for investors to continue to puff on Hong Kong-listed China Tobacco International.", "authors": ["Jacky Wong", "Jacky.Wong Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103099/social"}
