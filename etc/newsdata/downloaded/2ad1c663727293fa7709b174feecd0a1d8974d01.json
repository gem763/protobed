Scientists at the University of Zurich found evidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in 61 per cent of the raw dog food samples tested\n\nIn 73 per cent of the pet food samples, the recommended value for enterobacteria was exceeded - the bacteria is known for causing stomach upset.\n\nWhile two samples contained salmonella, known to cause diarrhoea in both animals and humans.\n\nThe researchers therefore believe that the raw diets, known as Biologically Appropriate Raw Food (BARF), are a significant risk factor for the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nPet owners will often come into contact with the bacteria when preparing the food and are likely to be in close contact with their pets, risking transmission of the bacteria from animals to humans.\n\nDr N\u00fcesch-Inderbinen said: 'We advise all dog and cat owners who want to feed their pets a 'BARF' diet to handle the food carefully and maintain strict hygiene standards.\n\nSalmonella cultures grown in a microbiology lab. Two samples contained salmonella, known to cause diarrhoea in both animals and humans\n\n'Pet owners should be aware of the risk that their pet may be carrying multidrug-resistant bacteria that can spread them.'\n\nPublic Health England warned earlier this year of the diseases spread by animals to humans from raw meats that can harbour dangerous bacteria \u2013 with fatal results in one case.\n\nIn the report, PHE said a food poisoning outbreak in August 2017 left four people seriously ill. One unnamed victim died of acute kidney failure.\n\nThe common link between all four cases \u2013 in the North East and South East \u2013 was contact with dogs.\n\nAll four were struck down by the same STEC bug \u2013 shiga toxin-producing E coli \u2013 and three dogs were fed on raw meat diets containing green tripe, the untreated contents of cows\u2019 stomachs.\n\nPHE said that its report suggested \u2018an increasing trend in potential risk to humans from raw pet food\u2019.\n\nCelebrity advocates of raw feeding for pets include Springwatch presenter and poodle owner Chris Packham, who commented on a dog food website: \u2018After doing a bit of research I discovered raw feeding and have never looked back.\u2019\n\nThe widespread and sometimes inappropriate use of antibiotics has led to many bacteria producing resistant enzymes called extended spectrum beta-lactamases (EBSL), which make certain antibiotics ineffective.\n\nThese EBSL were found in over 60 per cent of the samples.\n\nOf particular concern is the fact that such enzymes cause resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, which are used frequently to tackle a wide range of bacteria.\n\nThe research was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.", "description": "Scientists at the\u00a0University of Zurich found evidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria in 61 per cent of the raw dog food samples tested.
