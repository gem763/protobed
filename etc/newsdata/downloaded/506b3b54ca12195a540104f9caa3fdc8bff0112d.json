They said it was being released in a bid to bring transparency and clarity to a call at the heart of a consuming political scandal that has sparked a House impeachment investigation.\n\nBut the whistleblower complaint that spurred the investigation described an \u201cofficial word-for-word transcript\u201d of the call \u2014 words closely matching the ones used by Trump on Wednesday \u2014 creating uncertainty about what was included in the document the White House released last week and what may have been left out.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials studying the document pointed to several elements that, they say, indicate that the document may have been handled in an unusual way.\n\nThose include the use of ellipses \u2014 punctuation indicating that information has been deleted for clarity or other reasons \u2014 that traditionally have not appeared in summaries of presidential calls with foreign leaders, according to the current and former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the elaborate, non-public process.\n\nIn two of the cases when ellipses were used, they accompanied Trump\u2019s reference to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which is at the center of a conservative conspiracy theory about a computer server central to the company\u2019s investigation of the Russian hack of Democratic Party computers that, according to those pushing the theory, is hidden away in Ukraine.\n\nThe use of ellipses in this passage fueled questions about what may have been removed and why.\n\nThe five-page document reports Trump said, \u201cI would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike... I guess you have one of your wealthy people... The server, they say Ukraine has it.\u201d\n\nIn the third use of ellipses, Trump was asking Zelensky about a different theory \u2014 also sometimes aired in the extreme corners of the Internet and on some conservative news networks \u2014 that Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden had, while vice president, demanded the removal of a prosecutor looking to investigate Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me,\u201d according to the call document.\n\nThe White House declined to comment Wednesday about the unusual markings or other apparent discrepancies. Shortly after the document\u2019s release last week, a White House official had said that the ellipses did not indicate missing words but referred to \u201ca trailing off of a voice or pause,\u201d and called it standard practice for records of presidential phone calls.\n\nCurrent and former officials said that would be slightly different from previous practice. They said when presidents simply trail off in a way that note-takers can\u2019t hear, that point traditionally has been marked \u201c[inaudible].\" When fragments of sentences aren\u2019t readily understood by note-takers, or when comments repeat a previous thought, they said, the transcripts had often been marked with dashes.\n\nOthers have noted the brevity of a document purporting to represent a call that lasted 30 minutes. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) had two of his office\u2019s interns read the call summary aloud, measuring its length with a stopwatch app. The time: 10 minutes 40 seconds, or roughly 20 minutes shorter than the White House\u2019s assertion about the call\u2019s length.\n\n\u201cOur motivating question was: How much don't we know?\u201d King said. \u201cThere has to be an inquiry to get to the facts.\"\n\nThe memorandum of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky appears remarkably different in speed and content from the full transcripts of calls between President Trump and foreign leaders The Washington Post obtained in 2017.\n\nThe transcript of a 24-minute call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in which both the participants spoke English, included roughly 3,200 words, or about 133 words per minute. A 53-minute call with then-Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, in which both Trump and the Mexican president spoke through interpreters, included roughly 5,500 words, or about 102 words per minute.\n\nThe White House summary of Trump\u2019s 30-minute call with Zelensky \u2014 which included interpreters because Zelensky spoke Ukrainian while Trump spoke English \u2014 includes fewer than 2,000 words, or roughly 65 words per minute. That suggests that the rough transcript of the Zelensky call includes about half the number of words that would be expected if the call had proceeded at the same or similar pace as the previous calls.\n\nIt was unclear whether the interpretation of the Zelensky call occurred simultaneously as the presidents were speaking or took place after a participant had finished speaking. The latter would have affected the speed of the conversation.\n\n(Neither the Turnbull nor the Pe\u00f1a Nieto transcript included ellipses.)\n\nThe record of the presidential call with Zelensky, which is labeled \u201cMEMORANDUM OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION,\u201d was marked as having been produced by note-takers in the White House Situation Room, as is standard for calls with foreign leaders. The record, however, is unusual for lacking a tracking number that would normally indicate it had been circulated to senior subject experts and the national security adviser\u2019s office for review and edits. Instead of a \u201cpackage\u201d number, the memo released by the White House carries a stamp saying: \u201cPkgNumberShort.\u201d\n\nThe document additionally carries classification markings that Situation Room staffers do not normally add when they create a word-for-word transcript, current and former officials said.\n\n\u201cI thought to myself, \u2018This didn\u2019t go through the normal process,\u2019 \u201d said one former government official who was among several who handled these records and found the document released by the White House curious.\n\nThe whistleblower said in his complaint that multiple U.S. officials had alerted him that \u201csenior White House officials had intervened to \u2018lock down\u2019 all records of the phone call, especially the official word-for-word transcript of the call that was produced \u2014 as is customary \u2014 by the White House Situation Room. This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.\u201d\n\nSuch phone calls also typically create at least two types of documents: a verbatim transcript made by note-takers in the White House Situation Room and an edited summary that is more widely circulated.\n\n\u201cThe one that was released is not the one the Situation Room created,\u201d said one person familiar with the creation of records of calls with foreign leaders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the secretive process. \u201cThat\u2019s just not possible.\u201d", "description": "Current and former U.S. officials studying the document pointed to several elements that, they say, indicate that the document may have been handled in an unusual way.", "authors": ["Carol D.
