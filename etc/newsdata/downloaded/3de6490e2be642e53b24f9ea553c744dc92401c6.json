Marcus said:\n\n\u201cWe could do it differently,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of having a synthetic unit ... we could have a series of stablecoins, a dollar stablecoin, a euro stablecoin, a sterling pound stable coin, etc [...] We could definitely approach this with having a multitude of stablecoins that represent national currencies in a tokenized digital form [...] That is one of the options that should be considered.\u201d\n\nThe originally proposed backing for the Libra token was a basket of various national currencies including the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Singapore dollar.\n\nThe project needs agility amid a hostile regulatory environment\n\nMarcus reportedly noted that the aforementioned stablecoins were not the Libra Association\u2019s preferred option for the project, but said that it must remain agile.\n\nThe association \u2014 the project\u2019s governing body \u2014 has lost several key members in recent weeks, including such major payment and e-commerce firms as PayPal, Visa, eBay, Mastercard and Stripe.\n\nAccording to United States Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the firms left the Libra Association because the project was \u201cnot up to par\u201d with American Anti-Money Laundering standards.\n\nIndeed, Libra is continuing to face pressure from global regulators, who are voicing increased skepticism over the project and its possible effect on global financial stability.\n\nFinancial ministers and central bank heads from the G20 countries have recently raised concerns that global stablecoins could negatively affect the sovereignty of monetary policy, particularly in developing nations. On Oct. 18, German Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz said that global regulators should prevent Libra\u2019s issuance outright.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify about the project before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Oct. 23.", "description": "David Marcus of the Libra Association reportedly said that the project would be open to using government currency-pegged stablecoins", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYzliMTdiOGUwNDAxMjVmOGQ2Nzk0ODYwYTQ2NWM5YzkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
