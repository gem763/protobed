The bank cut rates deeper into negative territory and promised bond purchases with no end-date to push borrowing costs even lower.\n\nVasle told STA the ECB could increase volumes and change the conditions for bond purchases.\n\nThe ECB expects growth in economic activity and prices to remain low in the coming months, mainly due to slower international trade, Vasle, who is governor of the Bank of Slovenia, said in a statement later on Friday.\n\nHe said the new actions taken by the ECB aim to \u201creplace the system where interest rates were determined for a certain period of time by a system where interest rates are determined in relation to the size of inflation\u201d.\n\nVasle said the ECB\u2019s action on Thursday aimed to influence not just short-term interest rates but also rates in the longer term.\n\nCurrent risks include U.S. policy, China\u2019s economic slowdown and Brexit and could lead to a further slowing in the euro zone and lower inflation, he said.\n\n\u201cBecause of the changed economic conditions, a reaction of other economic policies is needed, particularly fiscal policy and not just monetary policy,\u201d Vasle told STA.\n\n\u201cActions of just one policy cannot change the flow of economic developments when considering the state we are in and the challenges ahead of us,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said current concerns are focused on an economic slowdown in the euro zone, rather than a recession. The trade dispute between the United States and China had hit manufacturing and industrial sectors the hardest but the services sector was still yielding good results, he said.", "description": "The European Central Bank is ready to step up its use of monetary policy tools and introduce new ones if necessary, governing council member Bostjan Vasle was quoted as saying by Slovenian national news agency STA on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
