The Toronto-based bank plans to double the size of its C$4.4 billion ($3.4 billion) book of indigenous commercial loans, deposits and investments by 2025.\n\n\u201cWe should actually exceed that by a bit,\u201d Stephen Fay, head of indigenous banking, said in an interview at his Toronto office. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can do it just by doing what we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\n\nFay thinks he can beat his boss\u2019s target even as he faces competition to reach the indigenous population, Canada\u2019s fastest-growing group, from rivals including Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, as well as new entrants such as private lender Bridging Finance Inc. Growth at Bank of Montreal\u2019s division has been about 21% so far this fiscal year, surpassing its historical pace and above Fay\u2019s annual goal of 19%.\n\nBank of Montreal started an aboriginal banking unit in 1992 with Ron Jamieson, a Mohawk from Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, running the business. He led a lean operation in the early years, with a handful of bankers lending, gathering deposits and establishing on-reserve housing-loan programs. Then Fay was tapped for a commercial-banking deal, his area of expertise.\n\n\u201cI was able to do an infrastructure deal there,\u201d Fay, 62, said. \u201cIt took me about six months of hard work trying to gain their trust, but we were successful and Ron liked how I did it.\u201d\n\nIsolated Areas\n\nJamieson asked Fay to join his team. Fay has headed the unit since 2009, and now oversees eight dedicated bankers across Canada, who are supported by about 60 account managers along with experts from other parts of the bank.\n\nClients are not always easy for the bankers to reach. In Quebec, for example, Bank of Montreal has on-reserve branches at Wemindji and Waskaganish on the James Bay coast, two remote communities linked by a road that takes eight hours to traverse.\n\n\u201cAll, with the exception of one, have an F-150 because what I found was the previous vehicles we were giving them when they were going into these remote communities would get damaged on some of the roads,\u201d Fay said.\n\nSuccess requires doing things differently: ditching neckties and forgoing email, and instead traveling to indigenous communities for face-to-face meetings -- and listening, Fay said.\n\n\u201cPicking up the phone and using text is not going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cYou go into the community and spend time talking to people. You may not even talk about business in the first one or two visits, but you\u2019re going to get to know people and build that trust and then try and find a way to provide value.\u201d\n\nMembertou First Nation, an urban Mi\u2019kmaq community of 1,700 on the east coast\u2019s Cape Breton Island, has dealt with Bank of Montreal for almost a decade, a relationship that began with a cold call from Fay, said Mike McIntyre, Membertou\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nSports Complex\n\nThe two built up a dialogue and the first deal was a C$700,000 loan to buy a garage for housing public-works equipment, McIntyre said. The bank has since provided more than C$20 million for on-reserve housing, fishing boats and a sports complex.\n\n\u201cThey get it,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThese guys are sincere and the people they have working for them strictly deal with First Nation banking.\u201d\n\nThe biggest deal for Bank of Montreal\u2019s indigenous banking unit this year was about C$80 million, involving a real estate development in western Canada. About 70% of the unit\u2019s loans are less than C$20 million. Other areas of banking include providing on-reserve home loans, cash-management services, infrastructure finance and helping indigenous groups with land-claims settlements, which have resulted in trusts that spin off income.\n\nThe bank has set up 122 on-reserve housing-loan programs, an initiative started in 1995 and designed to permit loans even with Indian Act restrictions on land ownership and mortgages. Under the programs, the borrowing risk falls to both the bank and the community.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A team of Bank of Montreal commercial bankers have traded their suits and ties for Ford F-150 pickups to reach Canada\u2019s remote regions and build up a part of their business that has yet to see a bad loan.Indigenous banking is one area Chief Executive Officer Darryl White targeted in June", "authors": ["Doug Alexander"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
