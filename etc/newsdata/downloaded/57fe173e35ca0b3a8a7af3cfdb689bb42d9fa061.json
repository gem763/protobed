It always can change its track,\" said Tod Goodyear, a spokesman for the sheriff's office in Brevard County. \"The problem you sometimes come into is the complacency for the next one.\"\n\nAs excruciating as the uncertainty surrounding Dorian's movement has been, Clay Inghram, a 35-year-old resident of Titusville who makes a living skinning alligators said the warnings can never be too strong.\n\n\"It's given us plenty of time to prepare,\" said Inghram. \"We always have a little bunker bag. If it doesn't hit us, we'll have it for the next one.\"\n\n(Reporting by Gabriella Borter; Editing by Scott Malone and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "Scott Renfroe was smoking cigarettes with his wife at the end of a dock in Titusville, Florida, on Tuesday morning, where he had come to see if Hurricane Dorian had brought the powerful wind gusts and rip currents that meteorologists have warned about for days.
