It is a success story assisted by one of pop\u2019s oldest tricks: the song being boosted by a new, glossier US-focused video. While the original, with its 64m views, paired the song with an actually quite moving Peter Capaldi-starring visual promoting organ donation, it focused too much on the wrong Capaldi. The new version features much more Lewis, and is full of cinematic emotion; all sad glances, lonely walks and constipated looks to camera.\n\nHe is not the first artist to have a US video makeover. Dua Lipa\u2019s original video for single Be the One \u2013 featuring the singer kneeling on a wooden floor in what looks like a Dalston loft conversion and walking around Soho \u2013 was eventually remade as a desert-based, flashy, Lexus-funded video/branded-content exercise co-starring Baby Driver star Ansel Elgort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about US marketing teams wanting to get their hands on it,\u201d says Jackson Ducasse, director behind Dua\u2019s UK version of the video. \u201cIt makes sense in a way because why would they let a product out into such a lucrative market without having a say in it? It\u2019s like what they do with movie posters in different countries; there\u2019s definitely a sort of cultural translation even between Britain and America.\u201d\n\nSo what qualities constitute a US reboot? As well as fixating more on the artist and giving it a movie-like sense of occasion, adding a load of US stereotypes seems to be high on the agenda. Take the second video for X Factor UK alumnus Cher Lloyd\u2019s 2012 hit Want U Back, which took her Americanised sound to its ultimate conclusion and had her sipping milkshakes in a diner (the UK version mainly featured iPads and exposed brickwork, possibly also in Dalston).\n\nSometimes, as Ducasse points out, the original video is too \u201cDIY, or the content a little bit edgy\u201d. That \u201cedginess\u201d might explain why Lorde\u2019s first, lingering, poetic video for Royals was trimmed by 23 seconds and re-released a month later in a tightly edited \u201cUS version\u201d, or why All Saints remade their video for Never Ever in 1998 ahead of an American push. While the original featured a lot of 16mm footage of the band with their exes, the big-budget remake positioned them near slow-mo lorries, helicopters and even a horse. \u201cI think [the label] felt it was more suited to the American market,\u201d Shaznay Lewis told me last year. \u201cI can\u2019t remember it. I\u2019ve wiped it from my mind. It never happened.\u201d\n\nWill this tactic continue? Now that singles can take longer to build globally, a new video is just another way of pumping new life into an old-ish song. Prepare to see more closeups of Lewis Capaldi\u2019s face, basically.", "description": "Exploring the cinematic emotion, slow-mo horses and milkshakes in American pop-promo reshoots", "authors": ["Michael Cragg"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b8e7a6ba34ac09f7cff0441274d1c746c24ce1b/0_12_3307_1985/master/3307.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e89650ce0f637f2cd4ffdd680424e44", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
