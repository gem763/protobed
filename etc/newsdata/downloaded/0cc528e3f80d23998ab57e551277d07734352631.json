But We Should Mediate Their Conflict With Turkey.", "language": "en", "text": "Caught up in a conflict between long-standing NATO ally Turkey and a recently engaged Kurdish tactical partner in Syria, the Trump administration has accommodated the legitimate security interests of Turkey by staging a partial pullback of U.S. special operations forces in northeastern Syria.\n\nIt did so to get out of the way of a Turkish intervention launched Wednesday.\n\nAlthough critics of the Trump administration have rushed to denounce the decision as a \u201csellout\u201d of the Syrian Kurds, that\u2019s not true. Washington received no payoff from Ankara for stepping aside, and is not \u201cabandoning the Kurds,\u201d as many critics contend.\n\nWashington\u2019s ad hoc partnership with Syrian Kurds never included a commitment to help them fight Turkey, only to fight the Islamic State, the terrorist army also known as ISIS.\n\nThe United States still supports Syrian Kurds against ISIS, just as it supports Iraqi Kurds and the Iraqi government against ISIS. But Washington has remained neutral with regard to Turkey\u2019s complaints about the threats Syrian Kurds pose to Turkey.\n\nTo be more specific, the Pentagon continues to support the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces against ISIS. It has declined, however, to work with the largest Kurdish armed faction within the those forces, the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG in its Kurdish acronym) to resist the Turkish intervention.\n\nIn geopolitical terms, that\u2019s a logical and necessary decision.\n\nTrump Warns Turkey\u2019s President\n\nTurkey is a long-term strategic ally that exercises major influence in the Middle East. The YPG is an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK in its Kurdish acronym), a U.S.-designated terrorist group that has waged war against Turkey off and on since 1984 in a bloody separatist insurrection that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.\n\nAlthough the Obama and Trump administrations accepted the YPG as a newfound tactical ally in the war against ISIS, neither administration embraced the YPG/PKK agenda regarding Turkey.\n\nBoth administrations stressed U.S. cooperation with the Syrian Democratic Forces, an ad hoc anti-ISIS coalition in which the YPG influence was diluted by the participation of Arab factions opposed to ISIS.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Oct. 7 warned Turkey against going \u201coff limits\u201d in Syria, and has threatened to apply economic sanctions if Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ignores the warning.\n\nThe president doubled down on the sanctions threat Friday by authorizingthe Treasury Department to prepare \u201csignificant sanctions\u201d against Turkey, if necessary.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from giving Ankara a \u201cgreen light,\u201d as some critics contend.\n\nWashington also stands ready to act as an intermediary between its Syrian Kurdish partners and Ankara. After Turkey has secured its border, a possibility exists that the United States can broker an understanding that could mitigate friction between the two.\n\nNor is the Trump administration removing all U.S. troops from Syria at this time. The Pentagon has pulled back about 50 special operations troops from the Turkish-Syrian border, and up to 230 U.S. troops\u2014out of the roughly 1,000 deployed in Syria\u2014have been redeployed to the south, but remain in eastern Syria.\n\nDisagreements Over Buffer Zone\n\nThe United States had been negotiating with Turkey on creating a buffer zone in northeastern Syria, in part to avert a unilateral Turkish intervention, which Ankara long had threatened.\n\nBut Erdogan, apparently frustrated over the failure of Washington to accede to his demand for a zone 20 miles deep and 300 miles long along Turkey\u2019s border, pulled the plug on the negotiations.\n\nThings came to a head Oct. 6, when Erdogan told Trump in a phone call that Turkey was determined to cross the border. After Erdogan stated that he would unilaterally establish the zone by force, Trump acquiesced and pulled U.S. troops out of harm\u2019s way.\n\nIf that order had not been given, there was a significant risk that U.S. troops would have been caught up in the fighting or even drawn into a military clash with Turkey.\n\nAlthough there has been much handwringing over the administration\u2019s failure to support the Kurds against Turkey, it\u2019s difficult to see how battling a NATO ally would have preserved American credibility as an ally.\n\nPentagon officials on Tuesday denied breathless press reports that defense officials had been blindsided by the president\u2019s action, revealing that Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, actually had participated in the president\u2019s phone call with Erdogan.\n\nWhat some U.S. officials may have been surprised by was Trump\u2019s tweet about a total U.S. withdrawal from Syria to end what he called \u201cendless wars.\u201d They know that the enemy gets a vote in ending any war, and ISIS by no means has given up fighting.\n\nHolding ISIS at Bay\n\nU.S. vigilance will be necessary to block the terror group\u2019s comeback. Trump must listen to his national security team and avoid declaring a premature end to war against ISIS.\n\nISIS has returned to its underground roots, but remains a potent threat to regional security and a long-term threat to U.S. security if it can regroup. The Islamist extremist forces that morphed into ISIS already made a disastrous comeback in Iraq in 2014 and could do so again in Syria.\n\nThe underlying political conditions that facilitated the rise of ISIS remain in Syria\u2014anarchy, dysfunctional government, and the systematic repression meted out by the Syrian regime of Bashar Assad. Washington must be careful not to contribute to a power vacuum that would make an ISIS resurgence easier.\n\nThe inspector general for the coalition to defeat ISIS warned in a report in August that ISIS has established \u201cresurgent cells\u201d in Syria and launched bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and suicide attacks in areas liberated by the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nTurkey is not in a position to guarantee that ISIS will not return. It would have to fight its way through the Kurds to get at ISIS.\n\nErdogan, who has turned a blind eye to the infiltration of foreign Islamist extremists into Syria through Turkey, always has viewed the Kurds as a bigger threat to Turkey than ISIS.\n\nFor better or worse, the Syrian Democratic Forces are a necessary partner in the struggle against ISIS. Not only does it have skilled and motivated fighters on the ground, but it controls more than 20 prisons and camps that hold about 12,000 ISIS fighters and 58,000 of their family members and supporters.\n\nBottom Line: Diplomacy Needed\n\nThe United States will have to withdraw from Syria eventually. The real issue is whether Washington has made arrangements to adequately protect U.S. interests; namely, preventing an ISIS resurgence, blocking expansion of Iranian influence, and reaching a political settlement in Syria that eases the humanitarian situation and allows the return of refugees.\n\nThe Turkish intervention complicates efforts to attain those goals, but does not make them impossible to achieve.\n\nIt\u2019s not too late to salvage an acceptable situation in eastern Syria if the administration can tamp down the fighting between Turkey and the People\u2019s Protection Units and maintain counterterrorism ties with the Syrian Democratic Forces.\n\nWashington should push for a cease-fire in northeastern Syria and reach a clear understanding with Ankara about the size and purpose of Turkey\u2019s new buffer zone.\n\nThe long-term goal should be to broker a sustainable understanding between Ankara and the Syrian Kurds, similar to the understanding that it brokered between Ankara and Iraqi Kurds.\n\nWithout such an understanding, Turkey\u2019s intervention will push the Syrian Kurds into the arms of Russia and the Assad regime. Such an outcome would undermine U.S. national security interests in the region, while promoting those of Iran and ISIS.\n\nFor more on this topic:\n\nIs Trump Serious About Syria?
