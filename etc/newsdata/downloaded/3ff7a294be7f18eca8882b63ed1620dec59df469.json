Privately, some observers suspect whatever Bolton ultimately says could damage the president.\n\nAm I going to have to like Bolton now? https://t.co/6wGEZxiye4 \u2014 Bradley P. Moss (@BradMossEsq) October 15, 2019\n\nOn Tuesday, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, offered the most detailed account yet portraying Bolton \u2014 a famously hawkish conservative known for his bureaucratic knife-fighting skills and loathing of liberals \u2014 as growing irate at the possibility that Ukraine policy was being warped by Trump\u2019s political ambitions.\n\nIn testimony before House lawmakers, Taylor said he was told by Fiona Hill and Alex Vindman, both National Security Council officials at the time, that Bolton \u201cabruptly ended\u201d a July 10 meeting with Ukrainian officials. He did so after Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, \u201cconnected\u201d a potential Trump meeting with Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, with \u201cinvestigations.\u201d\n\nAs he ended the meeting, according to Taylor, Bolton told Hill and Vindman that \u201cthey should have nothing to do with domestic politics.\u201d Bolton told Hill, who has also since left the NSC, that she should \u201cbrief the lawyers.\u201d Bolton also opposed setting up a call between Zelensky and Trump \u201cout of concern that it \u2018would be a disaster,\u2019\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nTaylor\u2019s statements aligned what Hill told lawmakers earlier. He confirmed a particularly colorful line from Hill: that \u201cBolton referred to this as a \u2018drug deal\u2019 after the July 10 meeting.\u201d\n\nHill also told lawmakers that Bolton described Rudy Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, who also was helping shape Ukraine policy, as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everybody up.\u201d\n\nBolton was not on the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the core of the impeachment probe. According to a detailed readout of that call, which Trump has defended as \u201cperfect,\u201d Trump repeatedly pressured the new Ukrainian leader to investigate Joe Biden.\n\nTrump pushed Bolton out of the national security adviser role in September, after months of rising tensions between the two, describing him as \u201ctough\u201d but \u201cnot smart.\u201d He also complained, \u201cJohn wasn\u2019t in line with what we were doing\u201d \u2014 remarks that at the time were interpreted to refer to Bolton\u2019s widely reported disagreements with the president over Afghanistan, Iran and North Korea.\n\nBolton\u2019s firing came almost exactly at the same time the Trump administration agreed to unfreeze some $400 million in military aid to Ukraine \u2014 money that Taylor came to believe was being held up to pressure Kiev into pursuing Trump\u2019s desired investigations.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/65/8d/7ae546b9400ab4a0979f6f6d7b0b/191023-bolton-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
