They can. They\u2019ve all proved it,\u201d said Anne Edwards, a longtime public events planner who worked with several administrations and countries. \u201cBut now it\u2019s up against the president\u2019s disappointment that it can\u2019t be Doral. That\u2019s going to be their big leap.\u201d\n\nFormer Democratic and Republican staffers who planned G-8 and other similar summits said there\u2019s no formula to the search, but it typically begins with the White House weighing its policy objectives along with the image it wants to present to the world \u2014 or to Americans.\n\nThen begins the process of seeking and culling specific locations. \u201cYou very quickly boil it down to about four or five. It\u2019s kind of like a job search: You look at 100 resumes, and 30 minutes later you\u2019ve got four candidates,\u201d said Jack McDougle, director of the liaison group for the 2004 G-8. \u201cThen you do a real deep dive on those four or five.\u201d\n\nIn 2004, that list comprised Sea Island; Mt. Washington, N.H.; the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia; the Biltmore in North Carolina; and Kiawah Island, S.C., according to the summit\u2019s executive director, Bob Goodwin. The Bush administration wanted to stay within the Eastern time zone and a nonstop flight from D.C., and it contacted the sites. (Administrations don\u2019t typically bid out an overall summit, but they do solicit bids for individual components, like a fleet of cars, after choosing the location.)\n\nGoodwin said Mt. Washington was never considered very seriously, but they made the New Hampshire visit for political reasons. They ultimately chose Sea Island for its vibe, lodging and seclusion \u2014 the ocean and an alligator-studded swamp on either side served as good security and anti-protester buffers, he said.\n\nBefore selecting Doral, the Trump administration visited several locations and considered three other finalists \u2014 one in Hawaii and two in Utah, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said last week.\n\n\u201cIt became apparent at the end of that process that Doral was far and away the best physical facility for this meeting,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nThe Deseret News suggested the Utah venues were Montage Deer Valley and the Stein Eriksen Lodge in Park City, but representatives at both told POLITICO they had no information.\n\nGreg Jenkins, who was a deputy assistant to George W. Bush and director of the advance office, criticized Mulvaney\u2019s comment last week that Doral was better than any other option.\n\n\u201cThe finalists that we actually went to look at, all of them would have worked,\u201d Jenkins said last week before Trump reversed course. \u201cSo to have a finalist list where only one could possibly work seems like stacking the deck to me, and a waste of money.\u201d\n\nA summit of this type is a massive undertaking \u2014 Goodwin started working more than a year out in 2003, eventually overseeing more than 200 employees and $25.6 million in State Department funding. An administration has to figure out transportation and lodging for thousands of attendees from several countries, each with its own press corps and set of demands.\n\nSummits this major are typically designated National Security Special Events. So as advance teams and then senior officials conduct site visits for the finalists, the Secret Service runs a security review process to advise the White House on what it would take to make each location safe.\n\nFormer Obama DHS official Juliette Kayyem said the Trump administration appeared to have insufficiently coordinated security vetting before announcing Doral. The Washington Post\u2019s David Fahrenthold reported that Doral\u2019s mayor found out about the selection from watching the announcement on TV.\n\n\u201cAny serious review would also have taken into account and assessed state and local resources,\u201d said Kayyem, who was in charge of intergovernmental coordination for summits like this. \u201cSo the failure to notify any of the state or locals who would be impacted by an event like this was to me \u2026 another clear sign that this was not a real review.\u201d\n\nEthical concerns aside, some former officials said Doral would have made a strong host due to its sprawling size and amenities, and that not many other places are able to satisfy a G-7 summit\u2019s many demands. \u201cThese days in particular, that list does get pretty small quickly,\u201d McDougle said.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Milwaukee, for one, has thrown its hat in the ring.\n\nBut ultimately, all the logistical and security considerations in the world may have to contend with an Oval Office occupant self-styled as the ultimate event host.\n\nOn Monday, Trump bemoaned the public outcry that had forced him to cancel Doral as the venue. \u201cI was willing to do this for free,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will cost a fortune for the country\u201d elsewhere.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Mulvaney told Fox News on Sunday, \u201che still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/63/d5/4fc6b49c42cfa23abe63bee8607e/191022-trump-doral-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
