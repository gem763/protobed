Police said that two people were killed and the assailant or assailants fled.\n\nAn attacker tried to force his way into the synagogue in the city of Halle but did not get in as 70 to 80 people inside were observing Yom Kippur, a local Jewish leader said.\n\nPolice said in a tweet that the suspects fled in a car, and soon after reported that one person had been arrested. They gave no information about that person, or the suspected target or targets, or why they thought the attack may have been carried out by multiple assailants.\n\nOfficers were out in force across Halle, a city of 240,000. They initially urged residents to stay at home, and the city\u2019s train station was closed. Several hours later, police said that there was no longer an \u201cacute\u201d danger to the population and residents could go back into the streets.\n\nThey didn\u2019t specify why the assessment had changed, but news agency dpa and newspaper Bild cited unidentified security sources as saying the evidence points to a lone assailant.\n\nFederal prosecutors, who in Germany handle cases involving suspected terrorism or national security, took over the investigation.\n\nA video clip broadcast by regional public broadcaster MDR showed a man in a helmet and an olive-colored top getting out of a car and firing four shots from behind the vehicle from a long-barreled gun. It wasn\u2019t clear what he was shooting at.\n\nPictures from the scene showed a body lying in the street behind a police cordon. The body was lying opposite a synagogue, about 30 meters (yards) away from the building, dpa reported.\n\nThe head of Halle\u2019s Jewish community, Max Privorozki, told German news magazine Der Spiegel that a camera at the entrance of the synagogue showed a person trying to break into the building.\n\n\u201cThe assailant shot several times at the door and also threw several Molotov cocktails, firecrackers or grenades to force his way in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the door remained closed - God protected us. The whole thing lasted perhaps five to 10 minutes.\u201d\n\nPrivorozki said there were 70 or 80 people inside the synagogue when the shooting occurred. Dpa quoted unidentified security sources as saying that an assailant laid home-made explosives outside.\n\nA witness interviewed on n-tv television said he had been in a kebab shop when a man with a helmet and a military jacket threw something that looked like a grenade, which bounced off the doorframe. Conrad Roessler said the man then shot into the shop at least once.\n\n\u201cAll the customers next to me ran, of course I did too \u2014 I think there were five or six of us in there,\u201d Roessler said. \u201cThe man behind me probably died.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hid in the toilet,\u201d he said. \u201cThe others looked for the back entrance. I didn\u2019t know if there was one. I locked myself quietly in this toilet, and wrote to my family that I love them, and waited for something to happen.\u201d\n\nPolice then came into the shop, he said.\n\nSynagogues are often protected by police in Germany. Police in two other cities in eastern Germany, Dresden and Leipzig, stepped up security at synagogues there after the shooting in Halle.\n\n\u201cShots being fired at a synagogue on Yom Kippur, the festival of reconciliation, hits us in the heart,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Twitter. \u201cWe must all act against anti-Semitism in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll our country\u2019s citizens of Jewish faith can be sure that we are with them with our whole heart and we will give them all the security that is possible,\u201d Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Berlin issued a statement that said, \u201ctoday\u2019s attack is an attack on all of us, and the perpetrators must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nPolice said shots were also fired Wednesday in Landsberg, about 15 kilometers (nearly 10 miles) from Halle but it wasn\u2019t clear whether the two shootings were related. Scores of police vans and a helicopter could be seen on the edge of the small town a few hours later.\n\nThe European Parliament held a moment of silence at the start of its session Wednesday to mark the unfolding situation in Halle.", "description": "A gunman tried to force his way into a German synagogue but did not get in.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS973_german_ZG_20191009132942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
