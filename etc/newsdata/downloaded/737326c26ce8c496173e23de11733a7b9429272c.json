The main U.S. stock indexes finished the day about flat, following Wednesday\u2019s rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Microsoft stock (ticker: MSFT) gained after declaring its latest buyback plans and a dividend increase. U.S. Steel stock (X) plunged after the company cut guidance. And short-term rental company Airbnb said it\u2019s going public next year. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nMoving Cautiously\n\nStocks closed flat on a quiet day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 52.29 points, or 0.19%, to finish at 27,094.79. The S&P 500 has increased 0.06 points, or 0.00%, to close at 3006.79, and the Nasdaq Composite edged up 5.49 points, or 0.07%, to 8182.88.\n\nThe Federal Reserve cut its target interest rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of its September meeting on Wednesday. The move was largely expected, and investors are now moving their focus to when the next cut\u2014if there is any\u2014will be. The central bank\u2019s latest dot plot suggests no more for this year, but the fed-fund-futures market is still pricing in a 65% probability of at least one more cut in December.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nStifel\u2019s head of equity strategy, Barry Bannister, thinks the central bank isn\u2019t being bold enough. Bannister is concerned that the \u201cFed is willing to play defense instead of offense, and anything they do could end up being too late.\u201d He believes the Fed has already allowed the funds rate to get too close to the neutral rate\u2014one that is neither too tight nor too loose. History tells us, he says, that the closer that rates get to neutral, the closer we are to recession.\n\nOne day after the U.S. Fed\u2019s monetary policy statement, global central banks continue to release updates on their own decisions. The Bank of Japan and the Bank of England left rates unchanged, Norway\u2019s Norges Bank tightened earlier than many expected, Taiwan\u2019s central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, and the Central Bank of Brazil cut its benchmark rates to a record low.\n\nThe global economy is now facing many headwinds. On Thursday, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) cut its outlook for global growth in 2019 to 2.9%, the lowest level since 2009 when the global economy was in a deep recession. The Paris-based research body forecast that growth will remain at a low level in 2020 as well.\n\nThe OECD noted that if the trade conflict between the U.S. and China spills over into other relationships between the two countries, their economies could be hurt even more.\n\nThe OECD cut its growth forecasts for the U.S. and a number of developing economies, including Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. It now expects the U.S. gross domestic product to increase by 2.4% this year, and 2% for the next year, down from May projections for 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "The main U.S. stock indexes finished the day about flat, following Wednesday\u2019s rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
