It emerged from chapter 11 the following year.\n\nGun maker Colt Defense LLC said it would stop producing semiautomatic rifles for civilians, citing a glut in the market.\n\nThe company, whose history dates back to the 1830s, is known for its trademarked AR-15 rifle, which is available to civilians. AR-15 style rifles have been used in many of the deadliest mass shootings, including attacks at a country music concert in Las Vegas in 2017, and a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 2018.\n\n\u201cThe market for modern sporting rifles has experienced significant excess manufacturing capacity\u201d in recent years, Chief Executive Dennis Veilleux said in a statement Thursday. \u201cGiven this level of manufacturing capacity, we believe there is adequate supply for modern sporting rifles for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nThe West Hartford, Conn.-based company said it would continue to manufacture its rifles for the military and law-enforcement agencies. Colt said those contracts are absorbing all of the company\u2019s current manufacturing capacity for rifles. Colt will continue to supply its revolvers and pistols to consumers, the company said. Messages left for Mr. Veilleux weren\u2019t immediately returned. The move comes as the gun industry has come under increasing pressure in recent months. Walmart Inc. and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Inc. have stopped selling AR-15s and similar rifles and put other restrictions on gun and ammunition sales, such as raising the purchase age to 21 in their stores. Shares of gun makers Sturm, Ruger & Co., Vista Outdoor Inc. and American Outdoor Brands Corp. each declined 1% or more on Thursday. Over the past 12 months, Sturm Ruger shares have fallen 37%, Vista Outdoor 63% and American Outdoor 62%. A number of the Democratic lawmakers have called for banning AR-15 style rifles and other semiautomatic rifles. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators recently met with President Trump to discuss expanding background checks during gun sales, The Wall Street Journal reported. However, in an interview with Fox News Thursday, Mr. Trump said negotiations are going very slowly. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not moving on anything. We\u2019re going very slowly in one way, because we want to make sure it\u2019s right,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the Democrats, we\u2019re working with Republicans.\u201d Sales of rifles climbed in 2015 and 2016, particularly when polls showed that Hillary Clinton was likely to win the 2016 election. However, sales have since decreased as gun buyers are unconcerned that the Trump administration and GOP-controlled Senate will enact meaningful gun reform. Other gun makers have said the semiautomatic rifle segment has been hurt by excess supply. \u201cWe see a lot of downward pressure on pricing\u2026.there\u2019s a lot of capacity out there still in the AR world,\u201d said Sturm, Ruger & Co. CEO Chris Killoy on an August earnings call. Colt filed for bankruptcy protection in 2015, citing the loss of key military business and an overload of debt. It emerged from chapter 11 the following year. Related Video California has tried three times to ban what lawmakers call assault weapons. Each time, gunmakers have made tiny tweaks to the offending rifles, and gun shops have continued selling guns that operate nearly identically to the banned models. WSJ explains how guns have evolved in the state, and why it can be difficult to make firearm restrictions effective.
