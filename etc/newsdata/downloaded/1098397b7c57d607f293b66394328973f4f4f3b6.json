In never before seen footage, Heidi the octopus changes skin-color, from light to dark, while sleeping upside-down in a tank\n\nThe clip is part of a PBS sequence, 'Octopus: Making Contact', which is set to premier to the public on October 2.\n\nMarine biologist David Scheel from Alaska Pacific University welcomes viewers into his home, as he observes an octopus named 'Heidi'.\n\nHOW DO OCTOPUSES CHANGE COLOR? The creature's skin color temporarily changes thanks to this mechanism. This process is triggered in the wild by a changing environment or by an emerging threat. On top of chromatophores, two other types of cells - iridophores and leucophores - are involved in the camouflaging process. Iridophores have layers of reflecting plates that create iridescent greens, blues, silvers and golds, while leucophores are cells which can detect what colors best match the animal's surrounding. This allows octopuses to appear inconspicuous whatever their environment and change their skin tone to match their surroundings.\n\nDuring this documentary, Scheel shares 'remarkable discoveries' about the animal's extraordinary intelligence, personality and skills, according to the producers.\n\nThe segment of the sleeping creature shows Heidi sleeping upside-down in a tank and in moments, her skin begins to change color --leaving Scheel to suggest that marine animal is dreaming.\n\nHowever, he has not conducted enough research to prove this theory, but he does speculate about what Heidi might be dreaming about.\n\n'If she is dreaming, this is a dramatic moment,' Scheel said.\n\n'You could almost narrate the body changes and narrate the dream. She sees a crab and her color starts to change a little bit, then she turns all dark, octopuses will do that when they leave the bottom.'\n\n'This is a camouflage, like she's just subdued a crab and she's just going to sit there and eat it, and she doesn't want anyone to notice her.'\n\n'It's a very unusual behavior to see the color come and go on her mantle like that, just to be able to see all the different color patterns flashing one after the other, you don't normally see that when an animal's sleeping.'\n\n'This really is fascinating.'\n\nAn octopus' mantle is a very special part of its body.\n\nLocated behind its head and opposite of its arm, this large bulbous structure is home to all of its organs.\n\n\n\nOctopuses have thousands of color-changing cells called chromatophores that lie just under the surface of the skin.\n\nThe researcher said this marine animal could be dreaming, as the different colors are the same camouflage she uses when hunting and eating prey while awake\n\nThese specialized pigment cells expand and contract and push the pigment to the surface.\n\nThe creature's skin color temporarily changes thanks to this mechanism.\n\nThis process is triggered in the wild by a changing environment or by an emerging threat.\n\nOn top of chromatophores, two other types of cells - iridophores and leucophores - are involved in the camouflaging process.\n\nIridophores have layers of reflecting plates that create iridescent greens, blues, silvers and golds, while leucophores are cells which can detect what colors best match the animal's surrounding.\n\nThis allows octopuses to appear inconspicuous whatever their environment and change their skin tone to match their surroundings.\n\nMarine biologist David Scheel from Alaska Pacific University welcomes viewers into his home, as he observes an octopus named 'Heidi'\n\nGiven that octopuses have very precise control over the system by which their skin color changes, it is rare for them to trigger the response while sleeping.\n\nUnlike humans, octopuses have multiple brains rather than just one central nervous system.\n\nInstead of being in one place, their brain cells are spread all over the body, which gives the creature very precise control to each part of the body.\n\nChanging the coloration over its skill is an active process that requires the octopus to activate specific bundles of neurons, and depends on a complex array of nerves and muscles controlling the expansion and contraction of the pigment sacs.\n\nThe segment of the sleeping creature shows Heidi sleeping upside-down in a tank and in moments, her skin begins to change color --leaving Scheel to suggest that marine animal is dreaming\n\nBut these controls may be activated while the octopus sleeps, if its unconscious mind is sensing a threat.\n\nOne hypothesis is that it may sense threat in its sleep - it could have something to do with what the creature is dreaming about.\n\nIt may be inconclusive, but octopuses species may also experience a dreamlike state like that achieved during REM cycles in humans.", "description": "A clip from PBS's 'Nature' has suggested octopuses  dream.
