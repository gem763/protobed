And it continues to be banned because the NFL refuses to make any changes to the list of banned substances without some sort of concession from the union.\n\nApart from any concession that the NFL may receive, Gronkowski has given the NFL an incentive to soften its stance.\n\n\u201cI also want to have the option to get back into the game, and if I\u2019m banned next year I can\u2019t,\u201d Gronkowski said.\n\nGronkowski explained that \u201cagony\u201d from physical pain makes it hard to focus during meetings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying you put this on and you\u2019re going to be healed, that it\u2019s a miracle,\u201d Gronkowski said. \u201cBut you can apply this and it\u2019ll help manage the pain, and then you can get treatment and it\u2019ll be a lot less stressful to the body.\u201d\n\nHere are two important realities to consider regarding Gronkowski\u2019s remarks. First, he has partnered with a CBD company. He\u2019s getting paid by that CBD company to advocate for its use.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, and more importantly, the NFL\u2019s current rules make it easy to use CBD during football season. If the player is clean during the offseason substance-abuse policy testing window that runs from late April to early August, the player can use CBD at will during training camp, the preseason, the regular season, and the postseason.\n\nThat reality makes Gronkowski\u2019s not-so-subtle quid pro quo (there\u2019s that phrase again) meaningless. If he really wants to return in 2020, he can use CBD during football season as long as he doesn\u2019t test positive during his annual offseason test.", "description": "As the clock continues to tick toward the deadline for a 2019 return from tight end Rob Gronkowski, Gronk has hinted that he'll return in 2020 -- if the NFL makes one specific change to its rules.
