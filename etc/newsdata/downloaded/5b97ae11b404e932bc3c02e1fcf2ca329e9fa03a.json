Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said it's better to be a \"wack job\" than a \"criminal who betrays our country\" in Twitter spat with President Trump. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A fringe political group claimed responsibility for a strange stunt at a town hall speech by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was interrupted repeatedly by a woman who boisterously claimed people need to save the planet by \"eating babies.\"\n\nThe woman, who had taken off her jacket to reveal a T-shirt that read \u201cSave the planet. Eat the children,\u201d was acting on behalf of the political group LaRouchePAC, the group tweeted Thursday night..\n\nVideo shows the woman continuing to raise her voice as Ocasio-Cortez shows little reaction. The woman goes on, saying, \u201cEven if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution, so we have to get rid of the babies. Just stopping having babies is not enough; we need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nThe freshman New York Congresswoman attempted to regain control of the room by largely ignoring the outburst, saying, \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s very important to us is that we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present. Luckily, we have more than a few months.\u201d\n\nThe woman tried to interrupt again and was escorted from the room.\n\nA Twitter account belonging to the LaRouchePAC, a group that has supported President Donald Trump, claimed responsibility.\n\nLaRouchePAC trolls AOC, AOC doesn't rule out eating babies. #EatTheBabieshttps://t.co/bD9ThZVcGO \u2014 Lyndon LaRouche PAC (@larouchepac) October 4, 2019\n\nThe group was created by Lyndon LaRouche Jr., until he died in February at the age of 96. He was a cult-like figure, who espoused a wide range of conspiracy theories and advocated for an overhaul of the world\u2019s economic and financial systems. He ran for president in every election from 1976 to 2004, including a campaign waged from federal prison.\n\nThe outburst at the town hall spurred a flurry of conservatives, including the president, using the comments against Ocasio-Cortez, .\n\n\u201cAOC is Wack Job!\u201d Trump tweeted, re-tweeting his son commenting on the ordeal. She responded: \"Better than being a criminal who betrays our country.\u201d\n\nIn response to the woman's outburst, originally Ocasio-Cortez reprimanded critics for attempting to \u201cmock or make a spectacle\u201d of the woman who \u201cmay have been suffering from a mental condition\u2026 Be a decent human being and knock it off.\u201d\n\nThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019\n\n#EatTheBabies and #EatTheChildren were trending on twitter by Friday morning.\n\nOcasio-Cortez then responded Friday that although the woman was a \"Trump supporter,\" it \u201cdoesn\u2019t rule out potential mental issue (Drs do that) but good to know they were not in crisis.\u201d\n\nLaRouche followers do not believe in climate change and often refer to global warming as \u201cpopulation reduction, not science.\u201d\n\nHis conspiracy theories included a claim that the International Monetary Fund was \u201cengaged in mass murder\u201d by spreading AIDS through its economic policies, that former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Vice President Walter Mondale were Soviet \u201cagents of influence\u201d and that the Queen of England was involved in the drug trade. He said former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos \u201cwas opposed to me and he fell as a result.\u201d\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/04/fringe-group-planned-eat-babies-stunt-aoc-town-hall/3869116002/", "description": "The woman is from LaRouchePAC, who claimed responsibility for the outburst on twitter.", "authors": ["Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
