The declines suggest that investors are growing increasingly hesitant of the unicorns, or companies valued at more than $1 billion in the private market before conducting an IPO.\n\nOf particular concern has been the companies' lack of profitability. Uber and Lyft are both stuck firmly in the red since their public debuts, with no relief in sight. In the second quarter, Uber posted a $5.2 billion loss, while Lyft lost $644 million.\n\nBeyond that, Uber and Lyft will likely have a bumpy road ahead as backlash and legislation around employment mount. Both Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash have pledge $90 million for a vote of Assembly Bill 5 in California, a bill that if passed would mean the companies have to give workers benefits.\n\nRead more: The IPO market is rebelling against many of 2019's money-losing unicorns.

Peloton, the fitness bike company, had the third-worst trading debut for a mega-IPO since the financial crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, some unprofitable companies have been unable to go public at all. WeWork recently scrapped IPO plans, electing to focus on its core business after a whirlwind few weeks that saw investors rebel against CEO Adam Neumann's leadership.\n\nWithout the capital injection and debt financing enabled by an IPO, the company could run out of money as soon as next year, according to Bernstein.\n\nRead more: A hedge fund manager who oversees $2 billion lays out the road to profitability for Uber and Lyft \u2014 and explains why they have a unique bull case compared to WeWork", "description": "Both Uber and Lyft\u00a0fell to record lows on Wednesday, showing that investors are shying away from unprofitable unicorns.
