And what a delight this \u2018new\u2019 place to stay is.\n\nI use quotation marks as the property is a 17th Century coaching inn, and until last September it had been closed for two-and-a-half years after being given up on by previous owners.\n\n\u2018When we bought it there was a water feature in the staircase,\u2019 jokes James Ratcliffe, who runs it with his partner Nina Matsunaga, who has Japanese ancestry and is the talented head chef.\n\nThe exterior of the Inn, which is located in the heart of Sedbergh\n\nHe is referring to a great leak from the lovely stained-glass skylight depicting bulls at the top of the central staircase.\n\nThat\u2019s been fixed, and the couple, who also run the Three Hares bakery and cafe in Sedbergh, have poured \u00a32.4million into revamping the old property. In came wine-coloured leather banquettes, bonsai trees, cow-hide rugs, modern art, eye-catching pictures of the Howgills and a complete overhaul of its 18 rooms.\n\nOh yes, and then there\u2019s the wabi-sabi. What is this, I ask? \u2018The Japanese philosophy of slight imperfection,\u2019 he replies, pointing to a section of old floor in the restaurant that looks like scruffy concrete and to slightly out-of-place original hall tiles. Locals and tourists alike, judging by the busy scenes on our Saturday stay, seem to love it.\n\nThe USP: Its unexpected Japanese streak, which makes it an exotic choice for walkers exploring the Howgills (maps are stocked in reception). Others may stay to browse in the dozen or so bookshops or wander the cobbled streets of this once-booming hub of the wool industry. Sedbergh is an official \u2018book town\u2019 and, like many rural communities, is building up its events portfolio \u2013 with Sedbergh Sheepfest (a two-day celebration of all things sheep) next weekend.\n\nAsian aura: One of the 18 rooms, all of which have had a complete overhaul\n\nThe rooms: The Far Eastern influence continues in the rooms where glass panels divide sleeping areas and bathrooms, which can be blocked for privacy by curtains. Charcoal-grey carpets, oatmeal curtains, pale-blue wood panels and little bedside reading lamps create a feeling of neat sophistication, with just the odd exposed beam or original wall adding some wabi-sabi.\n\nThe food: While there is a warming bar with log-burner, the dining room steps up the fare. Forget every- day pub grub, this is fine-dining. Nina\u2019s touch is exquisite, and the menu is mouth-watering: woodland mushroom tortellini with truffles, lobster broth, partridge with celeriac and morel. My cod cheek with dahl and coriander is spicy and subtle, while the sage and chestnut pastry is mustardy and delicious, and the venison perfectly cooked.\n\nFor pudding, go for the gorgeous chocolate with blood orange served on a sesame crisp. Three courses are from about \u00a329. Next morning, guests are invited to \u2018Breakfast like a king\u2019 with eggs from the Black Bull\u2019s own small flock of free-range chickens featuring highly on the menu.", "description": "The Black Bull is located in the market town of Sedbergh in Cumbria.
