The English international nutmegged his marker and found Milner, but he blasted his volley into the stands.\n\nMan\u00e9 then had a chance to put his side ahead midway through the first half after referee Chris Kavanagh waved play on for advantage after Milner was fouled. The Senegalese international\u2019s shot from 18m went straight towards goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel but gave the Dane no problems.\n\nFive minutes from the break, Man\u00e9 went one better giving Liverpool the deserved lead as he beat Schmeichel in the far corner for his 50th Premier League goal for the club.\n\nFormer Liverpool coach Brendan Rogers, now in charge of Leicester, brought on Ayoze Perez in the 72nd minute and the Spaniard gave the assist with 10 minutes to go for the equaliser as he played a wonderful through pass to Maddison, who edged the ball past Adrian.\n\nThree minutes into injury time, Leicester\u2019s Marc Albrighton took the ball back into his own area and, after some confusion with Schmeichel, he lost the ball to Man\u00e9, who went down after contact with Albrighton.\n\nKavanagh pointed to the spot, but the players then had to wait several minutes as the decision was looked at by the video assistant referee (VAR), but in the end \u2013 much to the delight of the Anfield Road crowd \u2013 it was not overturned.\n\nMilner stepped up and gave Schmeichel no chance with a well-taken shot into the left corner.\n\nHe said it was never easy to take a penalty after waiting for a VAR decision: \u201cYou just try to keep your concentration and wait for the final decision. It is always tough to take a penalty when the game is level and it is in the last minute.\n\n\u201cBut I think it was a very important win for us as, even though we are not playing so well, we are getting the results. That gives us a massive boost and we are gaining confidence as a result.\u201d\n\nREAD: Who are the Premier League's best of the rest?\n\nThe win sees Liverpool continue their unbeaten run at home in 43 league games. Their only run that was better was between 1979 and 1980, when they went 63 matches unbeaten before losing to Leicester City.\n\nManchester City have a chance to cut Liverpool\u2019s lead to five points if they beat the Wolves at home this afternoon.\n\nIn the early game, Tottenham\u2019s woes continued as Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team went down 3-0 at Brighton, who scored twice through Aaron Connolly after Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris gifted Neal Maupay the opening goal.\n\nThe French goalkeeper suffered a freak injury in the process and had to be stretchered off with an arm injury, compounding a miserable week for Spurs that saw them also lose 7-2 at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.\n\n. Meanwhile, a 72nd-minute volley from Jeff Hendrick gave Burnley a 1-0 win over Everton in the Premier League at Turf Moor yesterday, condemning Marco Silva\u2019s side to a fourth straight defeat.\n\nThe result leaves Everton languishing in 17th place, a point above the relegation zone, while Burnley extended their unbeaten run to four games and moved up to fourth place ahead of today\u2019s games.", "description": "Liverpool went eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table yesterday as they beat Leicester City 2-1 with an injury-time penalty.", "authors": ["Peter Auf Der Heyde"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/3e13aeb3ddc540d8b2ff05dc7c6fbbf6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
