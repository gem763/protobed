Fans of Blizzard\u2019s online battle arena game Heroes of the Storm have been clamouring for Deathwing\u2019s addition to the game\u2019s all-star lineup for years. Now he\u2019s coming, and based on the early footage shown, he looks like he\u2019ll be a uniquely powerful beast.\n\nOne would assume Deathwing\u2019s earth-shattering power would have to be severely toned down to allow him to compete in five-on-five arena battles with the likes of StarCraft\u2019s Jim Raynor, Overwatch\u2019s Hanzo, and the titular heroes from The Lost Vikings. But Deathwing sure doesn\u2019t look weak. The Heroes of the Storm version of him will be the largest character in the game. Unlike other dragon characters in HotS, he has no human form. When he is on the battlefield, he\u2019s hard to miss. He moves slowly about the battlefield, but what he lacks in mobility, he makes up in being a giant, intimidating-as-hell dragon.\n\nAccording to live game designer Adam Jackson, speaking during yesterday\u2019s Deathwing reveal stream, the massive character model fits with the fantasy the team is trying to realise, giving players the feeling of being a massive evil beast with no regard for mortal life.\n\nTo communicate this disdain for perceived lesser beings, Deathwing does 100 per cent bonus damage to other heroes. Deathwing walks slow, but he\u2019s also permanently unstoppable, which means he\u2019s immune to movement impairing effects. In order to balance those powerful passive traits, Deathwing also cannot receive buffs or support of any kind from other players on his team. Other players cannot speed him up, buff his damage, clone him, or even heal him.\n\nInstead of a traditional mount, Deathwing gets Dragonflight, launching him into the air, high over the battlefield, withdrawing from combat. That\u2019s how Deathwing travels. It\u2019s also how he regains health. Flying is the only means Deathwing has to heal. Furthermore, the black dragon\u2019s health bar is split into four segments, each representing a piece of armour plating. Each time his health loses a segment, Deathwing loses an armour plate and becomes easier to damage. That\u2019s the price one pays for being a nigh-unstoppable aspect of death.\n\nWhile in the air, Deathwing disappears from view for other players on the battlefield. When he comes crashing down, which he can do anywhere on the map where he has vision, enemies will scatter, and rightly so. Deathwing players can choose one of two different forms when they land.\n\nThere\u2019s the Destroyer form, which is all about landing in the middle of a group of enemies clawing, swiping, and flaming, and the Worldbreaker form, with more medium-range abilities that involve area-denial and manipulation attacks, tearing apart the ground under his enemies\u2019 feet. Deathwing\u2019s ultimate sees him rising into the air and flying forward, leaving a wide, fiery line of destruction in his wake.\n\nThe various abilities are detailed in the Deathwing First Look video below, around the 12:30 mark, with full-on gameplay starting at around 28 minutes.\n\nWhat an absolute monster. While Deathwing\u2019s skills may change between now and his release, which is expected to happen around the first big game update following this year\u2019s Blizzcon in early November (where he\u2019ll be playable on the show floor), so far it seems the Heroes of the Storm team have done the evil beastie proud.", "description": "Deathwing the Destroyer is the massive black dragon whose escape from his underground prison shattered World of Warcraft\u2019s Azeroth, his fiery rage forever changing the face of the planet.
