The policy was announced by the province\u2019s previous government late in 2018 after a glut of crude built up in storage, sending the discount on heavy Canadian crude versus U.S. benchmark oil to record levels of more than $50 a barrel.\n\nCanadian heavy oil is currently trading at a discount of $12.50 a barrel below U.S. crude, according to Net Energy Exchange.\n\nCurtailments have eased steadily throughout the year, with the amount companies are allowed to produce increasing from 3.56 million bpd in January to 3.79 million bpd in October.\n\nThe first 20,000 bpd a company produces are exempt from curtailments, meaning only 15 out of more than 300 Alberta oil producers are affected.", "description": "The government of Canada's main oil-producing province Alberta on Thursday eased oil curtailments for November and December, allowing producers to increase output to 3.80 million barrels per day and 3.81 million barrels per day respectively.", "authors": ["Nia Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
