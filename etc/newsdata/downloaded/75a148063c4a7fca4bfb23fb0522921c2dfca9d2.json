These changes are creating more balanced market conditions.\u201d\n\nSurrounded by mountains, Vancouver, which is in the province of British Columbia, has traditionally been a hot market because it\u2019s a lively, culturally savvy city that has an affinity for the great outdoors.\n\nMore: Nearly 400-Acre Canadian Estate in Rugged Wilderness to Be Auctioned\n\nIts temperate climate makes it the perfect venue not only for a variety of al fresco events and festivals but also for ambitious athletic activities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the California of Canada,\u201d said Monique Badun, senior vice president, sales for Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Canada. \u201cIn one day, I can swim in the ocean, and an hour later I can ski in the mountains.\u201d\n\nRanked as one of the top 10 most livable cities in the world by Mercer, a human resources consulting firm, Vancouver, which is home to The University of British Columbia, has some of the most desirable real estate in the country.\n\n\u201cGeographically, it\u2019s like San Francisco,\u201d Ms. Badun said. \u201cThe closer to the core you get, it\u2019s the winning ticket. It\u2019s not quite New York City, but prices start at C$2,000 (US$1,499) per square foot. Starter homes are C$2 million to C$4 million.\u201d\n\nNicknamed Hollywood North, it is a major film-production center. \u201cThe X-Files,\u201d \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d \u201cRiverdale,\u201d \u201cSmallville\u201d and \u201cSupergirl\u201d are among the TV shows that have been shot there.\n\nMore: Will Bitcoin Be Accepted for Property Tax Payments in Toronto?\n\nHere are profiles of four of the city\u2019s most coveted neighborhoods.\n\nFirst Shaughnessy\n\n\n\nNamed after founder Thomas Shaughnessy, the former president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, First Shaughnessy is the oldest, most prestigious and one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Vancouver.\n\nCreated in 1907, it features heritage houses on large properties.\n\nThe exclusive residential neighborhood\u2014it\u2019s only nine blocks long and 10 blocks wide\u2014is bordered by 16th Avenue on the north, King Edward Avenue on the south, Oak Street on the eastand EastBoulevard on the west.\n\nIt has some 350 homes, most of them built between 1907 and 1910 in the Craftsman style. These estates, which are on sites ranging from 12,500 square feet to one acre, sell for C$6 million to C$30 million, said Ms. Badun, who added that First Shaughnessy has a classic feel and look similar to Greenwich, Connecticut.\n\nMore: Vancouver\u2019s Quick Cooldown Has Opened an Opportunity for Buyers\n\n\u201cSince 2015, First Shaughnessy has been a Heritage Conservation Area,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot tear down anything prior to 1940. Before the designation, there were tear-downs, so there are some newer homes. Most of them have not come on the market yet, but the few that have are reselling for $25 million to $35 million.\u201d\n\nNor, added Karley Rice, an agent for Macdonald Realty, can you alter the exteriors. \u201cIt\u2019s always been Vancouver\u2019s most distinguished neighborhood, and because of these rules, it will remain this way forever,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Badun agreed that there\u2019s no other neighborhood like it in Vancouver.\n\n\u201cIt has stunning beauty,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s incredibly convenient\u2014it\u2019s 10 minutes from the airport, six minutes from the downtown, six minutes from the beach and four minutes from the shopping areas.\u201d\n\nMore: A California-Style Residence on the Coast of British Columbia\n\nMs. Rice said that in addition to being the geographical center of the city, First Shaughnessy is distinguished by its winding, tree-lined streets and the type of large homes and lots that are typical outside the city\u2019s downtown area.\n\n\u201cVancouver is on a grid, except for First Shaughnessy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the width of the streets are not compact\u2014wide boulevards run between them.\u201d\n\nShe said that most of the residents are \u201cold prominent Vancouver families\u201d but that a new younger generation is starting to move in.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a changing of the guard,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are the ones who are modernizing the homes\u2019 interiors.\u201d\n\nAlthough there are no schools in the neighborhood, there are several within walking distance.

Properties on the water along Point Grey Road near Kitsilano Beach, she added, sell for C$8.5 million to C$25 million.\n\nMore: Architecture Has to Match Location, Says Toronto Developer\n\n\u201cThe neighborhood\u2019s popular and trendy to downsizers,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Rice added that the wide range of prices attracts a \u201cdiverse group of people from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nKitsilano Point, or Kits Point as the locals call it, commands some of the highest prices, with detached houses selling for C$5 million to C$7 million, Ms. Badun said.\n\nRegardless of size or age, houses are typically in the classic Craftsman style with wood shingles and front porches.\n\n\u201cThey look like homes you see in New York\u2019s Hamptons,\u201d Ms. Badun said.\n\nKitsilano also has the distinction of housing the most expensive property in the province of British Columbia: The four-lot beachfront estate owned by Lululemon founder Chip Wilson that was assessed at C$78.8 million in 2018, according to published reports.\n\nMore: Tech Talent Choose Ottawa for High Quality of Life\n\n\u201cThe area along 4th Avenue and the beach where Wilson lives, what we call North of 4th, is like a lifestyles of the rich and famous,\u201d Ms. Badun said. \u201cPoint Grey Road, which borders it, was closed to vehicular traffic, so it is now a biking and walking path.\u201d\n\nThe clubs, restaurants and boutiques are centered along West 1st and West 4th Avenues.\n\nLululemon\u2019s flagship is on West 4th as is Mr. Wilson\u2019s first business, Westbeach, a snowboard and ski apparel company.

Nobody was buying, and the city had to take over the project.\u201d\n\nToday, the sleek glass buildings, whose street-level floors have retail components, are highly sought after.\n\nMore: Custom Penthouse Atop a 53-Story Tower in Downtown Vancouver\n\n\u201cThey are bringing C$1,700 to C$2,300 per square foot for the waterfront\u2014some of the highest prices in the city of Vancouver,\u201d Ms. Badun said. \u201cAnd there are more buildings going up.\u201d\n\nAt Canada House, the development\u2019s two signature waterfront buildings, units are selling for C$4 million to C$8 million, Ms. Badun said.

The people who are living in the village are young families, so high schools are not a big consideration.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of development going on in the area,\u201d Ms. Rice added. \u201cThe neighborhood runs into False Creek Flats, which is a community in the works that will include an arts district. I push all my condo investors to consider the area.\u201d\n\nMs. Badun said the mix of retail, restaurants and residences makes the Olympic Village a real community.\n\n\u201cYou can walk to the bank and the grocery store, which is rare in all of Vancouver,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s far away from the hectic pace of downtown, but you can walk to your job downtown along the seawall and be in your office in 20 minutes.
