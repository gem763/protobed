The market needs short-sellers more than it realises", "language": "en", "text": "This is most certainly the case when it comes to capital-hungry, acquisitive companies that brokers cannot help but support.\n\nThese are the ideal clients of brokerage firms because they do deals, always need to raise money, and their share prices tend to rise in the process, feeding the street.\n\nThe accompanying research also tends to be overwhelmingly positive. As one astute investor pointed out, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) sector is gift from heaven for the stock-broking industry.\n\nBNPL providers may never actually make money, but will constantly need to raise capital as they grow. And as the paper wealth of the founders swells, the pitch is on to manage the sell-down.\n\nA cynic, therefore, might expect the research to remain perpetually bullish and price targets to keep on pushing on.\n\nThere are several examples of lost business coincidentally occurring when \"buy\" ratings are dropped, but few are willing to provide the detail in this small market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd as most analysts have found out, there is no reward for sell-side analysts who make brave bearish calls, while the punishment is severe and sometimes career-ending.\n\nSelf regulation\n\nIn this context, a few short reports that force investors to take notice and management to answer questions they have otherwise avoided, is arguably healthy.\n\nThe second reason is that in recent history, the market has done a good job of self regulating.\n\nThat is, it can establish in a reasonable amount of time whether a report has merit or not, based on the company's response, and subsequent information that comes to light.\n\nThe purists can argue that an error-ridden or exaggerated short report really should not be able to do long-term damage. The ability of the business to make money and the short-term gyrations of the share price should be unrelated.\n\nAnd if the fall is large enough, investors, management and the company should be able to seize on the opportunity to create value for themselves and shareholders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere that argument falls over is when it applies to companies whose model is predicated on access to capital, and the cost of that capital.\n\nBanks, insurers and to some extent fund managers are commoditised organisations whose business models rely on the perception they can be trusted. A damning report has the ability to erode this.\n\nSelf-fulfilment\n\nAnother example are those same acquisitive companies or \"roll-ups\" that use their higher market valuations to finance the purchase of other companies and grow their revenues.\n\nA short report has the ability to permanently \"de-rate\" this type of company to the point where future transactions are less accretive, the strategy grinds to a halt, and a further de-rating is triggered as the market reassesses future growth prospects.\n\nThis is where a short report has the potential to be self-fulfilling.\n\nBut then again, so is the nature of these business models under attack.\n\nWhether a company that is dependent on cheap capital to create value should ever have commanded a premium that the market gave them, and that the shorts have taken away, is another deeper debate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now though executives and directors of listed companies will have to remain on alert. At any moment they could become victims of a short report.\n\nHow should they protect themselves? Expensive lawyers, savvy corporate advisers and external crisis public relations teams can only do so much.\n\nThe best protection from activists short sellers is good governance, conservative accounting, and resisting the urge to become stock promoters.", "description": "Short reports are chaotic but they do have a role to play, and go some way towards balancing the ledger of unchecked optimism from the sell-side.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.4572%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/46b12883ea0715475a378caa4524c261da16d5f9", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
