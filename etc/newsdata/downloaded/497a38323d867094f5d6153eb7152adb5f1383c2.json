there are a wide range of types.\n\nPersonality disorders are thought to affect about one in 20 people.\n\nThey are more likely to have other mental health problems, such as depression, or drug and alcohol problems.\n\nLike other mental disorders, upbringing, brain problems and genes can play a part in their development.\n\nWhat did the study do?\n\nEvery month during pregnancy, the study - in the British Journal of Psychiatry - asked women to answer questions about their mental stress levels.\n\nThey had to say if they had notable stress, some stress or no stress.\n\nThe women lived around Helsinki, Finland, and their babies were born between 1975 and 1976.\n\nWhen those children turned 30, any diagnoses of personality disorder were noted - there were 40 in total, which were all severe cases involving admission to hospital.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat did it find out about stress?\n\nThe study found prolonged, high levels of stress during pregnancy could have a potentially long-lasting effect on children.\n\nChildren exposed to severe maternal stress were 9.53 times more likely to develop a personality disorder than those whose mothers experienced no stress.\n\nThose exposed to moderate stress had four times the chances.\n\nThis could be stress related to relationship problems, social factors or psychological problems, for example.\n\nWhy is stress damaging?\n\nIt's not known how stress in pregnant women could increase the risk of personality disorders - it could be down to changes caused in the brain or the result of inherited genes, or a number of other factors in the children's upbringing.\n\nThe researchers tried to tease out the effects of stress alone, by controlling for other factors such as the psychiatric history of the pregnant women, whether they smoked during pregnancy or had depression.\n\nPrevious research has found links between stress in pregnancy and the development of depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nDr Trudi Seneviratne, who chairs the perinatal faculty at Royal College of Psychiatrists, said pregnancy could be a stressful time and mums-to-be needed support.\n\n\"If stress isn't tackled, there is a high chance it will spill into the post-natal period,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a really sensitive thing to talk about.\n\n\"We don't want parents to think they are damaging their children - but high levels of stress do affect us.\"\n\nShe said NHS England had dramatically improved perinatal mental health services in recent times.\n\nHow can stress be reduced during pregnancy?\n\nWomen should be supported at home and work during pregnancy and given coping strategies for when they were stressed, Dr Seneviratne said.\n\n\"They need to learn to rest, to ask for support and talk to someone about how they are feeling.\"\n\nEating a balanced diet, stopping smoking and getting regular sleep is also advised.\n\nMore advice is available from the Royal College of Psychiatrists' website and NHS UK.\n\nAnd after the birth?\n\nLead study author Ross Brannigan, from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, said: \"This study highlights the importance of providing mental health and stress support to both pregnant women and families during the antenatal and postnatal period.\"\n\nYour midwife or health visitor should ask if you have ever had problems with your mental health in the past and whether you have feelings of hopelessness after your baby is born.\n\nYou should be offered support from health professionals to help you manage your feelings.", "description": "A study of more than 3,000 pregnant women followed up their children over 30 years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/17AE/production/_108626060_gettyimages-653003570.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
