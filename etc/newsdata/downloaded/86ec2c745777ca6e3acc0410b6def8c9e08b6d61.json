With that in mind, Monday's meeting with Bulgaria feels like the most important England game since their 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia.\n\nIf that sounds a little hard on the Nations League, in which England lost a semi-final to Holland last June, then so be it. That was an experimental UEFA competition.\n\nThe European Championship, on the other hand, is very much the real thing and we await to discover what Friday night's defeat by the Czech Republic really means.\n\nEngland will be desperate to bounce back from their 2-1 defeat to the Czech Republic\n\nMonday's game in Sofia will tell us much. The weakest opponent in the group, Bulgaria should represent the perfect opposition to aid recovery. If England win, Friday's setback will be viewed as a timely reality check, wake-up call or whichever cliche you wish to use. Another performance like Friday's will deliver a different kind of message entirely.\n\nThis is the nub of competitive sport; the way you react to failure has always been key.\n\n'We have to make sure we bounce back from it and we have to show we have resilience,' said England manager Gareth Southgate on Sunday night. 'Defeats tell you a lot about people in terms of how everybody reacts. So, we've got to make sure we get the reaction right here.'\n\nGareth Southgate has called on his players to provide the perfect response on Monday night\n\nSouthgate has watched back every minute of Friday's defeat on TV and found little new to encourage him. There were, unusually for this England team, virtually no mitigating circumstances.\n\nEngland were poor from first minute to last and from front to back. On Monday night, we can expect to see Southgate revert to a more familiar 4-3-3 formation and make five changes.\n\nThat, perhaps, says as much about his ongoing uncertainty over his best team as it does about the performance in the Czech Republic.\n\nSouthgate has too much experience of international ups and downs to fret unduly and is not the type to panic. But he has mentioned the uncertain club form of some players on enough occasions recently for us to know that this subject genuinely concerns him. Rightly so.\n\nMonday night, for example, Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings will replace Everton's Michael Keane and his partnership with Harry Maguire must show signs of promise soon.\n\nKeane's international form has been so poor that it is not feasible for him to continue to command a place in the team.\n\nSouthgate also spoke on Sunday night of the 'anxiety' that grew in some of his players as things went wrong in Prague. It appeared that one of those he believes to have been affected was West Ham midfielder Declan Rice, expected to make way for Harry Winks on Monday,\n\n'There are players who we're giving the football to in key areas, like Declan Rice who's still 20 years old,' said Southgate. 'I've got to always remember that. We're putting a lot of onus on young players.\n\n'So, this now is the time for a solid performance, to get back on track. Remember the objective is to qualify.\n\n'We've been trying to qualify, develop the team, blood players, and the other night that didn't quite work for us. But it's the first time it hasn't.'\n\nMonday's game was always going to present England with a challenge. Part of the Vasil Levski Stadium will be closed as punishment for incidents of racism by supporters, and despite what the home federation have said in public in recent days, they have already told England privately that there could well be problems of that nature.\n\nHarry Winks is one of those expected to come in for the Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria\n\nTyrone Mings is set to make his England debut, replacing Michael Keane at centre-back\n\nSo, what was always going to be a big night for Southgate and his players now feels a little bigger.\n\nPerhaps it's timely. After all, England will not play all of their games in next summer's finals at Wembley.\n\nAnd, if they cannot come through an away game against a side ranked 62nd in the world, what chance will they have playing a Euro 2020 quarter-final against a much better team in somewhere such as Rome next July?\n\nSouthgate's England are a good side, but they are a developing side, too. As things stand, you would not back them to win next summer's championship but if nights like this can improve them and teach them and nurture them, who knows where we might be when the tournament kicks off.\n\nThat, at least, is the positive way to look at things. Currently, all that Southgate has to chew on is the memory of Friday's sterile showing and a hullabaloo about one player who is not even here, James Maddison.\n\nIt is not too much of a stretch to say Southgate's players owe their manager something much better on Monday night, as much as they owe it to themselves.\n\nWest Ham midfielder Declan Rice is expected to give way for Winks on Monday night", "description": "IAN LADYMAN IN SOFIA: Monday's meeting with Bulgaria feels like the most important England game since their 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia having been beaten by the Czech Republic.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665126-0-image-a-123_1570998318986.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
