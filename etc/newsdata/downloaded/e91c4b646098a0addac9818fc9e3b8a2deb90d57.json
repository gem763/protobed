Many American readers and viewers of \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d are already heavily invested in the story of Gilead because we\u2019ve come to identify with the Handmaids\u2019 hopes that the nightmare will end and the United States \u2014 with its democratic norms and constitutional guarantees \u2014 will soon be restored. We identify because the events in Atwood\u2019s novel \u2014 which not so long ago felt like something that could only happen in the distant past or in distant parts of the globe \u2014 now feel frighteningly real. Because news segments on television in 2019 are filled with images of children being torn from their parents\u2019 arms, a president using racist language to sow fear and hatred and reports of accelerating climate change jeopardizing life as we know it on the planet. This also explains why the scenes in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d that feel most haunting today are the flashbacks in which Offred remembers her former life in America, when she and her friends took for granted the rights and freedoms they enjoyed, when people reassured one another that whatever emergency measures taken by the new government (in the name of protecting against Islamic terrorism) were temporary and that normalcy would soon return.\n\nEnduring dystopian novels look backward and forward at the same time. Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d was at once a savage satire of the Soviet Union under Stalin \u2014 from its rewriting of history to its cult of personality to its use of torture and propaganda \u2014 and a shrewd anatomy of totalitarianism that foretold the rise of the surveillance state and the fire hose of falsehood spewed forth daily by Putin\u2019s Kremlin and Trump\u2019s White House in attempts to redefine reality. Aldous Huxley\u2019s \u201cBrave New World\u201d reflected its author\u2019s worries in the 1930s that individual freedom was threatened by both communism and assembly-line capitalism, and it anticipated a technology-driven future in which people would be narcotized and distracted to death by trivia and entertainment.\n\nAtwood, who began \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d in the Orwellian year of 1984, decided that she would include nothing in the novel \u201cthat had not already happened\u201d somewhere, some time in history, or any technology \u201cnot already available.\u201d She extrapolated some of the trends she saw in the 1970s and early \u201980s, like the rising fundamentalist movement in America. She imagined what she called \u201cthe heavy-handed theocracy of 17th-century Puritan New England \u2014 with its marked bias against women\u201d \u2014 reasserting itself during a period of social chaos. And she drew upon historical horrors like the Nazis\u2019 Lebensborn program and public executions in countries like North Korea and Saudi Arabia to delineate the malign machinery of the Gilead regime.\n\nAtwood\u2019s creation of Gilead, like her creation of the futuristic wasteland that serves as a backdrop to \u201cOryx and Crake\u201d and \u201cThe Year of the Flood,\u201d was informed by her wide-ranging reading in dystopian literature and related genres, lending these novels a faintly postmodernist density and gloss. The stories of Nicole and Agnes in \u201cThe Testaments\u201d similarly reflect Atwood\u2019s easy familiarity with Victorian literature, which she studied in graduate school at Harvard in the 1960s.\n\nThe sisters\u2019 quests to discover their family roots, for instance, mirror the efforts made by so many of the orphans in 19th-century literature, like Dickens\u2019s Pip and Oliver Twist. Much the way that Offred struggled in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d to come to terms with the expectations of her radical feminist mother, in \u201cThe Testaments\u201d Nicole and Agnes find their search for self-definition tied up in questions about their real mother\u2019s identity. Nicole is shocked to learn that the life she\u2019s been leading in Canada \u2014 as Daisy, the daughter of owners of a used-clothing store \u2014 is \u201ca forgery.\u201d Agnes realizes that much of what she grew up believing about Gilead has been a lie \u2014 that the regime\u2019s corrupt leaders have been rewriting the Bible in a Big Brother-like endeavor to market and justify their dictatorial rule.\n\nIf Agnes comes across as willfully na\u00efve in the opening sections of \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d Atwood appears to be making the point that Agnes begins as a very ordinary girl. Ordinary in the way that Offred was ordinary in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d \u2014 a smart, resourceful young woman, more concerned, initially, with the travails of daily life than with politics or the larger world. Atwood\u2019s Offred was not a rebel like her friend Moira and not an ideologue like her mother. In fact, she asserted that she didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthe incarnation\u201d of her feminist mother\u2019s ideas, didn\u2019t want to have to \u201cvindicate her life for her.\u201d", "description": "In her new novel, Margaret Atwood explores the intertwined fates of Offred, her daughters and Aunt Lydia.", "authors": ["Michiko Kakutani"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/books/review/22Kakutani1/22Kakutani1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
