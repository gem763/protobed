The scene screams Hawaii, yet technically I\u2019m in Tokyo. I\u2019m in the Ogasawara Islands, an archipelago of more than 30 islands in the Pacific Ocean which, despite being sprinkled 1,000km south of the frenetic skyscraper-filled capital, are considered a subprefecture of it.\n\nThese oceanic islands, formed by undersea volcanic eruptions some 62 million years ago, are Japan\u2019s equivalent of the Galapagos \u2013 never connected to a continent, home to unique flora and fauna, divine beaches and world-class diving. During three weeks\u2019 travel across Japan, not a single person I met had visited. Most hadn\u2019t even heard of the Ogasawara Islands.\n\nDespite being made a Unesco World Heritage site in 2011 due to its distinct ecosystems, one-of-a-kind plants and uniquely evolved land snails, Ogasawara has remained off the beaten track. To get there requires a 24-hour ferry from Tokyo, which only departs once a week; only 300 overseas visitors make the trip each year.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn the age of instant travel gratification, the pull of a slow journey to a rarely visited wilderness is irresistible. So, in my final week in Japan I board the Ogasawara-Maru, a hulking liner with an 890-berth capacity, bound for Chichijima, the larger of Ogasawara\u2019s two inhabited islands, home to 2,000 people. Puttering away from the Tokyo skyline, internet connection trails off and the rock of the open ocean ramps up.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

On the top deck are Japanese retirees rocking waistcoats and sun visors in an oddly chic ballroom-on-hols look, while on the promenade levels are birdwatchers who pap brown boobies torpedoing into the water with military precision. A fellow lone traveller, Japanese teacher Noriko Eguchi, is here for \u201cwhat\u2019s under the water\u201d. She\u2019s a scuba nut, tempted by tales of sea turtles and wild dolphins. Also, between January and April, humpbacks pass by, while from June to November sperm whales arrive.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, forested peaks with licks of blinding-white beaches come into view, and we drop anchor in Futami Bay. Chichijima\u2019s main town constitutes two sleepy streets \u2013 a strip of brightly painted guesthouses and a handful of places to eat. Showing me around is translator Ludy Sforza, who swapped Tokyo for Chichijima seven years ago. He points out two dinky supermarkets, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t like to shop today. When the boat brings fresh food, it\u2019s too hectic.\u201d I\u2019m charmed that supermarket rush hour means a 10-deep queue.\n\nAlong a tiny parade of restaurants, one is California-cool; another has Hawaii-look surfboard stacks outside; and a Japanese seafood joint sits close to a house where an American flag flutters. The multicultural scenery reflects the Ogasawara Islands\u2019 complex history. Discovered by Japan\u2019s Ogasawara Sayadori in the 16th century, Chichijima was first settled in 1830 by a group of Americans, Hawaiians and Europeans. In the late 19th century, the islands became a Japanese territory, were later evacuated and used as military bases in the Second World War, before falling under American occupation in 1946, then handed back to the Japanese in 1968. Nowadays, several cultures co-exist.\n\nFor a slow-paced place, there\u2019s plenty to do. First up, beaches. Ten minutes from the guesthouses I stay at \u2013 Pension Cabbage Beach and Papa\u2019s Island Resort, both simple, homely spots where flip-flops are left at the doors \u2013 are the white sands at Sakaiura Beach. Just offshore are the remains of a Second World War vessel where sea turtles outnumber snorkellers. A short drive away is Kominato Beach, a combination of silvery sand and a mirror-like lagoon edged by pillow lava hills which look like clenched giant\u2019s fists.\n\nOut at sea the next morning, a boat from Take Nature Academy whizzes me through bumpy waves towards Minamijima, an uninhabited, protected island limited to 100 visitors a day. Leaving Futami Bay, pods of bottlenose dolphins skip through the waters. It kills me not to stop and swim with them, but tide levels have to be just-so to land on Minamijima, so we press on. The scene is straight out of Jurassic Park: rapier limestone rocks carpeted with violet and green beach cabbage where wedge-tailed shearwaters make their nests, the surrounding sea thick with white-tip reef sharks. Keiichi, my guide, advises me not to look back as we scramble up some precarious rock-hewn \u201csteps\u201d. Up top, the views are even better: Ogiike lagoon has a heart-stopping fan-shaped cove with Durdle Door-like arch, islets which rise from the water like prehistoric creatures, and a beach littered with 800-year-old semi-fossils \u2013 the remains of mandarina luhuana, a long-extinct endemic snail.\n\nThe following day is all underwater wow, diving with Papa\u2019s Diving Studio, north of Chichijima. At Barachin, batfish and wrought-iron butterflyfish dart through a shipwreck, and a blunt slipper lobster \u2013 seemingly a cross between gargantuan woodlouse and a creature from Stranger Things \u2013 gallops across the ocean floor. Snorkelling close to the port, 10 green sea turtles skull nonchalantly past, unbothered by my presence.\n\nHiking on Chichijima is another highlight. Guide Hiroshi Sato leads me to Higashidaira, a sanctuary for the rare red-headed pigeon. In a dry shrub forest filled with octopus trees which look like mangroves-on-stilts, he points out uniquely evolved plants \u2013 ones which would be thorny on the mainland, but here, have lost their thorns due to lack of predators. Among tangled banyan trees at nearby Mulberry mountain, gas mask filters lie discarded, echoes from Chichijima\u2019s wartime past. Our final stop is a nondescript patch of greenery. Hiro points at some unremarkable-looking mushrooms on a log. I\u2019m bemused. He cups his hands around them and suddenly they glow neon green. No one\u2019s quite sure why these bioluminescent mushrooms, known as green pepe, do what they do, and I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it.\n\n\u201cOne of my friends refers to these islands as a different planet,\u201d Ludy says to me later on, over passion fruit liqueur at a Chichijima haunt named after the psychedelic \u2019shrooms. \u201cThat ship is like a spaceship. You wake up, step outside and it\u2019s another world. There is some kind of magic here, I think.\u201d\n\nWhen it\u2019s time to leave, 150 plus locals line the dock, Auld Lang Syne booms from speakers and the Ogasawara-maru\u2019s promenade decks are packed with waving passengers. A flotilla of dive boats fire up their engines and escort us out of the bay. In our own closing ceremony, dive crews strip to their wetsuits and flip into the ocean, to raucous applause and laughter from the boat deck; an extraordinary goodbye from an otherworldy place.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nGetting there\n\nInternational travellers should contact the Ogasawara Tourist Association in good time before travel to help with on-the-ground-arrangements (accommodation, ferries, activities) as operators speak limited English.\n\nReturn flights from London Heathrow to Tokyo via Bangkok with Thai Airways cost from \u00a3649pp.\n\nThe Ogasawara-maru sails once a week from Tokyo\u2019s Takeshiba Pier (twice a week during the summer months) to Chichijima, with prices ranging from \u00a3170-515pp each way, outside of peak season.\n\nStaying there\n\nPension Cabbage Beach is a cheery blue-and-white clapboard fronted guesthouse fringed by palm trees with rustic rooms and a laid-back vibe. Rooms with a shared bathroom from \u00a357pp.\n\nRun by the team behind Papa\u2019s Diving Studio, rooms at Papa\u2019s Island Resort are spacious but simple, with plenty of useful facilities for scuba divers such as washing machine/hanging space out back for wet clothes.
