Yet everyone watching the Watergate hearings had an opinion about John Dean, Nixon\u2019s inscrutable White House counsel and a key player in the scandal. Dean\u2019s horn-rimmed glasses gave him the look of an accountant, but he spoke like a cold-blooded assassin. He spilled everything: the bugging of Democratic National Committee headquarters, the cover-up, the pay-off to Howard Hunt, the infamous Enemies List. It wasn\u2019t clear he could be believed. Joseph Alsop famously called him a \u201cbottom-dwelling slug.\u201d In The New York Times, William Safire, a former Nixon speechwriter, wrote a piece of doggerel titled \u201cGunga Dean.\u201d \u201cSo it's Dean! Dean! Dean! Smear your leader, save your skin and vent your spleen!\u201d\n\nDean was telling the truth, of course, and for that he has been rightly celebrated. But in 1973 most people saw him as a traitor, including many liberals. Hunter Thompson, an admirer, called Dean \u201ca fiendish little drone.\u201d Writing in The New York Review of Books, Nicholas von Hoffman said Dean was \u201cthe American ratfink of the twentieth century, so much so that a century hence \u2018to pull a John Dean\u2019 may mean to double-cross your pals.\u201d\n\nLoyalty is a Boy Scout virtue, and nobody feels the pain of disloyalty more acutely than whistle-blowers themselves. (Not for nothing did Judas wind up dangling from a tree.) Of all the crimes and sins that Dean committed in the White House\u2014destroying evidence, punishing political enemies, obstructing justice\u2014it was the prospect of disloyalty that seared his conscience most. Dean had worked under Attorney General John Mitchell and felt very close to him. Not only did Mitchell approve the Watergate break-in, he had admitted it to Dean. For Dean to tell the truth about Watergate would mean a prison sentence for Mitchell, a man he thought of as an uncle. \u201cNow I felt the razor edge between the squealer and the perjurer,\u201d Dean wrote in his memoir. \u201cI had never felt more squalid.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most honorable figure to emerge from Watergate was Butterfield, one of the few staffers who knew about the secret taping system. Unlike Dean, Butterfield was involved in no illegal activity. Unlike Felt, he had no career ambitions that would be served by his revelations. Butterfield simply found it impossible to lie. When he was asked a direct question about Nixon\u2019s tapes during the Watergate hearings, he answered honestly. \u201cAre you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office?\u201d Senator Fred Thompson asked Butterfield. \u201cI was aware of listening devices, yes, sir,\u201d Butterfield said, after a pause. With that single sentence, Butterfield handed over the keys to the Watergate cover-up.\n\nWhistle-blowers are often asked why they blew the whistle despite the grave risks to themselves. Their answers are often disarmingly matter-of-fact. They don\u2019t make complex moral arguments. They don\u2019t appeal to foundational principles. They don\u2019t cite legal statutes or verses from the Bible. They say things like, \u201cI had to be able to look at myself in the mirror\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s simply how I was raised.\u201d When Butterfield was asked why he did it, he said, \u201cI answered truthfully because I am a truthful person.\u201d Which explains both nothing and everything.", "description": "The choice to blow the whistle or to stay silent is a choice about the sort of person you are and the one you want to be.", "authors": ["Carl Elliott", "Author Of A Forthcoming Book About Whistleblowers"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_05053102289/facebook.jpg?1569960338"}
