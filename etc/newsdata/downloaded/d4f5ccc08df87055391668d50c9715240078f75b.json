But if I were managing a hedge fund, I would bet on it.\n\nTo see why, we must start with Donald Trump himself. Distraction is Trump\u2019s modus operandi; this was true for his 2016 campaign and he must have concluded from its success that this was also the best way to govern.\n\nBut Donald Trump\u2019s main goal at this point is to get re-elected. And the bulk of his big donors \u2014 including the biggest contributors to the Republican Party \u2014 don\u2019t want this fight to drag on.\n\nTrump\u2019s trade wars are therefore best understood as a set of distractions. The end result doesn\u2019t matter all that much to him politically, and is therefore not worth that much political risk.\n\nOf course, there are things that some of his donors might actually want to win from this fight with China: stricter enforcement of patents to benefit the pharmaceutical giants who also gouge American consumers out of hundreds of billions of dollars annually; or greater access for U.S. bankers to China\u2019s financial sector.\n\nNo one wants this fight\n\nBut Trump\u2019s main goal at this point is to get re-elected. And the bulk of his big donors \u2014 including the biggest contributors to the Republican Party \u2014 don\u2019t want this fight to drag on.\n\nWho else does Trump care about? Trump is practically unique among political leaders in the world in that, among the electorate, he has directed his energies almost exclusively at his hard-core base. Even most dictators will generally try to expand their base by reaching out to people outside of it in their speeches and actions.\n\nBut Trump has not; possibly because he has been concerned about the threat of impeachment. His hard-core base has been seen as the main force that keeps Republicans \u2014 especially the 20 of 53 Senate Republicans needed to convict him if he were impeached \u2014 from betraying him.\n\nEven now, with the House having initiated an impeachment inquiry, it appears that this base is what Trump and his allies are counting on to protect him and get him re-elected.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s base does not care all that much about his fight with China.\n\nDeclares victory without any substance\n\nIf he makes a deal and declares victory without gaining anything significant, as happened \u2014 e.g., with Mexico and the European Union \u2014 there is little reason to suspect that he would get any more trouble from his base than he got in those episodes.\n\nEspecially since he is not even fighting for things that might benefit them. If he succeeds, for example, in getting China to reduce the conditions that it imposes on U.S. firms investing there \u2014 such as sharing their technology \u2014 this would only encourage more U.S. corporations to move their production from the U.S. to China.\n\nFinally, there is no sizable political opposition force \u2014 most importantly Trump\u2019s 2020 opponents \u2014 that is likely to gain significant political advantage by attacking Trump for his failure to \u201cwin\u201d anything in this trade war with China.\n\nThere is also some political risk for Trump in continuing this trade war. Because of the visible damage it\u2019s causing, he could get blamed for various negative economic outcomes that may occur before the presidential election. This could happen because of various events and how they are interpreted.\n\nFor example, the U.S. stock market is overvalued and could fall sharply at any time; this could be blamed on Trump\u2019s trade war, and although the stock market is not the economy \u2014 far from it \u2014 it is sometimes treated as such by much of the media.\n\nExaggerated impact\n\nThe actual impact of the trade war on the U.S. economy has been somewhat exaggerated, although there is no doubt that some sectors have been hurt \u2014 e.g., farmers hit by China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs. U.S. goods exports to China are less than 0.6% of U.S. gross domestic product, and they have fallen by 18% from last year. That adds up to about one-tenth of 1% of GDP.\n\nThere are other costs of the trade war that are more difficult to measure, such as reduced investment and economic activity because of the uncertainty caused by trade wars with unpredictable results. But it is difficult to see this trade war tipping the U.S. economy into recession.\n\nStill, if there is a recession or serious slowdown before the election, Trump\u2019s trade war with China will likely increase the blame that he gets for any downturn. The incumbent president is often held responsible (or takes credit when it is good) for the state of the economy.\n\nFor all of these reasons and more, it\u2019s likely that Trump is preparing to end this distraction and move on to the next one. We can only hope that it\u2019s not something more violent and destructive, such as an actual shooting war.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s trade wars are best understood as a set of distractions.
