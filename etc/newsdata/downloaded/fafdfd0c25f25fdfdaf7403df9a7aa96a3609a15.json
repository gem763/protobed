Even with a makeover and even with altering his appearance, it's difficult if he's all tattooed up like that,\" DePaul said. \"There's only so much you can do, besides completely go off the grid and go dark somewhere. And then your whole life changes at that point. It's a life-altering circumstance you're in.\"\n\nThe witness protection program has disguised famous witnesses before \u2014 even giving them plastic surgery and liposuction\n\nDaniel Hernandez, aka, Tekashi 69, aka 6ix9ine, appears at his arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday, July 11, 2018.

The crimes carry a minimum sentence of 47 years in prison, though federal prosecutors have vowed to try and cut him a better deal due to his cooperation.\n\nWITSEC has been floated for Hernandez since he has received at least one death threat from the gang, according to The New York Times. But the possibility has prompted a number of questions over how US Marshals could possibly conceal the rapper and social media influencer whose distinctive appearance is recognizable to millions of people across the country.\n\nRead more: Inside the wild world of US Marshals, who do one of America's most dangerous jobs\n\nBut DePaul said the agency can make even the highest-profile witnesses with top-dollar bounties on their heads disappear for good. WITSEC has protected roughly 18,900 people since the program was created in 1970, disguising many an infamous criminal who flipped and turned government witness.\n\n\"It's not their first rodeo, that's for sure,\" DePaul told Insider. \"They got everyone from [Irish-American mobster] Mickey Featherstone to [former Gambino underboss] Sammy Gravano \u2014 the worst of the worst or the best of the best, however you look at it\u2026They can protect anybody. It doesn't matter who it is.\"\n\nSalvatore \"Sammy the Bull\" Gravano, a former member of the Gambino family, prepares to testify 01 April, 1993 about corruption in the sport of professional boxing.

DePaul said it wouldn't be unusual to give Hernandez a similarly thorough makeover.\n\n\"They'll do whatever's necessary to protect that person, that's their job,\" DePaul said. \"Whether they're going to spend money to remove the tattoos or add some new ones, I don't know.\"\n\nTo protect Hernandez, the US Marshals first have to make sure he's serious about the program\n\nDePaul said he saw some parallels between Hernandez's case and the months he spent as a US Marshal in 1992 working with the mobster Gotti and Gravano.\n\nGravano has told media he quickly chafed against some of the more aggressive restrictions WITSEC placed on him \u2014 for instance, he was forbidden from contacting his family, friends, or anyone he knew in his previous life. He eventually divulged his identity, reunited with his family, and was convicted and sentenced again for trafficking ecstasy.\n\nIf Hernandez goes the same route as Gravano, \"he won't last long,\" DePaul said.\n\nMembers of the Fugitive Location and Apprehension Group, FLAG, held a briefing in a parking off East 52nd Ave at Monroe Street in Denver, CO, Saturday, July 30, 2011 The Denver Post/Craig F. Marshal via Getty Images\n\nIf Hernandez commits to the program, he'll have to sit through \"a litany of questions and agreements and contracts.\" After that comes the complex labyrinth of rules and regulations known as \"TPP,\" for tactics, techniques, and procedures, DePaul said.\n\n\"When that time comes, and he needs that protection, he's going to cooperate,\" he added. \"[The Marshals] are going to take a hard look at him and do their homework and make sure he's completely on board. They're not going to dedicate their resources and manpower and credibility, if you will, to somebody who doesn't want to play ball.\"\n\nDePaul said most of the rules and regulations WITSEC places on witnesses are unknown, due in part to the need for secrecy, but also because every case is different.\n\nTekashi in court for a previous criminal case. Bob Levey/Getty Images\n\nHe said US Marshals generally work with prosecutors to come up with a plan, perform a threat assessment, figure out what to do with the witnesses' families, and tailor the rules directly to the people involved. DePaul said the agency even takes extreme measures like running safehouses to help guard witnesses while they're transported from one location to another.\n\nIn Hernandez's case, it's hard to know what the details of such an arrangement would look like. But DePaul said if the agency goes so far as to extensively plan Hernandez's new life and give him a new name, a new place to live, and new government-issued documents, the expectation is that Hernandez will commit.\n\nHe'll have to follow the general rules of sticking to his new identity, never divulging his real name or history, and never again contacting the people he once knew, DePaul said.\n\nIf he flouts the rules and protection he's been given, DePaul said the US Marshals won't have any qualms about kicking him to the curb.\n\n\"They'll give it their best obviously, and if he violates it while he's in their protection, then yeah, they'll pull him,\" he said. \"They'll say, 'Well, alright, good luck.'\"", "description": "A former US Marshal says it wouldn't be easy to place Tekashi 6ix9ine in the witness protection program \u2014 but it's not the agency's \"first rodeo.\"", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cc01a21214c69d3635514-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
