The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 3.5% in September to reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also grew in September, but slightly less than expected.\n\nThe focus will shift to the next round of U.S.-China trade negotiations expected in Washington on Oct. 10-11 to see if the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has hurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.\n\n\u201cModerate job growth and subdued inflation in the United States is a positive for stocks,\u201d said Shusuke Yamada, head of FX and Japan equity strategy at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cHowever, the dollar is a little soft heading into U.S.-China trade talks.

There is no onshore trading as Monday is the last day of China's holiday break.\n\nThe United States and China have slapped tariffs on each other\u2019s goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing\u2019s trading practices, which Washington says are unfair.\n\nCentral banks around the world have been easing policy to offset the negative impact from the trade war.\n\nThe Fed has already lowered interest rates twice this year, but a strong jobs market suggests further rate cuts may not be necessary.\n\nThe yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rose to 1.5187% compared with its U.S. close of 1.5140% on Friday.\n\nWorries about political instability in Hong Kong could hurt market sentiment after China\u2019s army took the unusual step of issuing warnings to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong over the weekend.\n\nFour months of often violent protests against Chinese rule has pushed the former British colony to the brink of recession and posed a serious challenge to Beijing\u2019s control of the city.\n\nSpot gold XAU=, an asset that is often bought during times of uncertainty as a safe-haven, rose 0.26% to $1,508.19 per ounce.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS, also considered a safe-haven asset edged slightly higher to 106.78 versus the U.S. dollar and gained to 72.20 per Australian dollar AUDJPY=.\n\nU.S. crude CLc1 dipped 0.34% to $52.63 a barrel as worries about oversupply regularly weigh on oil futures prices.", "description": "Asian shares edged higher on Monday after data showed the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world's largest economy.", "authors": ["Stanley White", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1437886135&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9600Y", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
