We should focus on protecting communities from climate change instead", "language": "en", "text": "By Eddy Isaacs\n\nThe Paris Agreement on climate change sets a course to limit global temperature rise to 2.0 degrees Celsius and preferably keep it below 1.5 C. Governments are making multibillion-dollar bets to fund technology and adopt regulations that have big implications for industrial strategy and economic development. Industries are also making multibillion-dollar choices on how best to position themselves in a lower-carbon economy. Three factors are critical in this effort: Decisions being made must be effective at the very large scale required. Technology options selected must have as great a chance as possible to reduce global warming\u2019s impact. And the emissions accounting system we adopt must accurately trace all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that actually end up in the atmosphere. At the moment, we are falling short on all three requirements.\n\nThe latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that global warming is becoming irreversible and that evidence supporting human-caused climate change is very strong. The IPCC argues, however, that it is still possible to limit global warming to a 1.5 C increase and describes various pathways by which countries could reduce their emissions.\n\nTo limit the increase to 1.5 C requires the phase-out of fossil fuels so that by 2050 global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decrease by 91 to 97 per cent, depending on the pathway. This transition will not be easy. At the moment, fossil fuels account for about 80 per cent of world energy consumption, with low-carbon energy (mostly hydro, nuclear, wind, solar and biomass) accounting for the rest. To replace fossil fuels by low-carbon energy will require all of the following:\n\nThat some 2,000 nuclear reactors be functional by 2050. This amounts to building one reactor a week for the next 30 years, which in turn requires surmounting problems related to high capital costs, regulatory delays, waste disposal difficulties and generally unsympathetic public opinion.\n\nThat renewables move from 20 per cent to more than 60 per cent of global electricity supply. Although there are excellent opportunities for greater reliance on low-carbon electricity, the intermittent nature of wind and solar makes both these options unreliable. They also require large amounts of land, which may be undesirable in itself and could be very expensive at the scale required.\n\nThat cumulative capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in geological formations be between 283 and 724 gigatonnes (Gt) between now and 2100. This scale is massive: one Gt is equivalent to displacing some 320 coal-fired plants (500 MW) with zero-emissions electricity. The commercialization of carbon capture and storage has been much slower than originally envisioned because of the high costs of CO2 capture, lack of infrastructure such as pipelines, potential difficulties preventing leakage from underground, insufficiency of storage space, and complex legal and regulatory issues.\n\nThat biofuels and biomass burning for heat and power either more than double or more than quadruple, depending on the IPCC mitigation pathway chosen. The bioenergy pathway is especially troubling in that under IPCC guidelines emissions going into the atmosphere are not counted directly, instead estimates are made of emissions due to harvesting, land-use changes, processing of the feedstock and associated services. This loophole may have contributed to a concerted but unhelpful global effort to increase bioenergy supply. For example, the same EU that has been working hard to reduce CO2 output has increased its biomass consumption by 65 per cent over the past decade. Many scientists believe that seeking to replace fossil fuels with biomass energy systems actually risks making matters worse. For example, an MIT-led study demonstrated that using woody biomass in power generation is worse than coal in terms of its climate impact. This is because of the time lag between the release of CO2 when the wood is burned and the decades required for regrowth, which can take between 44 and 104 years.\n\nIn a recent report released by the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, I argue that because global warming depends on accumulated CO2 emissions over the many decades the gas remains in the atmosphere, we should count GHG emissions from all hydrocarbon sources, including bioenergy, as emissions against the carbon budget. If that were done, as it should be, many countries\u2019 emissions would be significantly higher than they currently report, putting them in a deep hole vis-a-vis their GHG reduction targets. As an example, biomass burning for heat and power accounts for nearly 25 per cent of Sweden\u2019s total energy supply. Estimating the direct emissions from all its biomass combustion nearly doubles Sweden\u2019s total reported emissions.\n\nThose who criticize countries for not doing enough seldom consider that the mitigation pathways described above are fraught with serious policy and engineering obstacles. Succeeding with all of them together, which is what is required to limit temperature increases to 1.5 C, is highly unlikely. Realistic policies therefore need to consider that global GHG emissions will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere and that no significant reversal of this trend is likely in the near future. In view of this reality, Canada should focus its climate-change resources on a pro-active approach to adaptation and should significantly increase investments in infrastructure to protect communities from the threats of sea-level rise and extreme weather events. Further, creative infrastructure solutions such as an east-to-west, modern, low-carbon electric grid should be built to allow provinces to develop more wind and solar opportunities. We should also pursue methods that involve using biological processes to increase carbon stocks in soils, forests and wetlands and increase forestation, as the federal government has just promised to do. And we should steer investments into non-combustion uses of biomass and fossil resources, including research into innovative manufactured products, such as carbon fibre and other low-carbon materials.\n\nConcerned Canadians urge us to think boldly on a grand scale. I agree. But let\u2019s make sure that solutions are effective, safeguard communities and lead to economic opportunities for future generations.\n\nEddy Isaacs, former CEO of Alberta Innovates\u2013Energy & Environment Solutions, is an executive fellow at the School of Public Policy, University of Calgary, and current president of the Canadian Academy of Engineering.", "description": "Opinion: Canada should focus its climate-change resources on a pro-active approach to adaptation", "authors": ["Eddy Isaacs", "Special To Financial Post"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/climate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
