But that turned out not to be the case. We were expecting to pay around $250,000 at closing but ended up paying around $275,000. Why were we given that advice?\n\nMore Matters: Reading the tea leaves in the real estate market\n\nMy dad was never offered a loan modification and went into foreclosure while this process was ongoing so I was forced to move fast. There were a host of other issues with the buyers and it was a huge mess.\n\nNow I\u2019m alone feeling so used and betrayed by both the agent and the attorney.\n\nA: There are times in a real estate sale when nothing goes right, and everything feels as though it is stacked against you. However, that doesn\u2019t mean your broker or your attorney did anything wrong.\n\nYour list of where your sale went wrong is long \u2014 and we feel for you. Some buyers can be real pains, and their behavior truly tests everyone in the transaction. It seems that you might have had that kind of a buyer.\n\nBut let\u2019s walk through a few of the highlights. By your own admission, you didn\u2019t have much, if any, experience selling a home and were relying on your real estate agent and attorney to help you out. The weak link here is probably your father: Once he stopped paying his mortgage payments, his loan started down the foreclosure path.\n\nWhen your father failed to make his first payment to the mortgage company, assuming you knew and had power of attorney for his financial matters, you could have stepped in and made that payment, along with any penalties owed. Once your father failed to make three or more payments, the loan went to the foreclosure department of your bank. At that point, your father owed three months of payments and three late fees, and other fees that were quickly piling up.\n\nWhen a loan goes into foreclosure, the lender may refer the loan out to a law firm to start foreclosure proceedings against the homeowner. Those attorneys\u2019 fees and costs get added to the loan along with any filing fees and court costs. We don\u2019t know at what point you came into the picture and realized there was a problem. If you had the money to make all the payments on the loan, you could have taken the property out of foreclosure.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you didn\u2019t have that money in hand, your real estate broker may have just assumed that the entire amount owed to the lender would get paid when the deal closed. While we would hope that your agent and attorney might have explained the process and costs to you, it appears that you didn\u2019t fully understand what was going on. In that respect, you might be right that your agent and attorney are at fault for not going over all the intricacies of the foreclosure, the costs and timing.\n\nMore Matters: Taking these steps can help you avoid a legal battle with your relatives over the inheritance of a house\n\nIn the end, if you couldn\u2019t come up with the money to bring the loan current \u2014 that is, pay all delinquent payments, unpaid interest, unpaid late fees, unpaid court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees \u2014 then that\u2019s how it would be settled at closing. And if it cost you $25,000 of the sale proceeds, that\u2019s understandable.\n\nOn the real estate tax side, you need to know that in some states, real estate taxes are paid a year in arrears. So in 2019, you pay the taxes that were due in 2018. If you live in a state where taxes are paid in arrears, it\u2019s common to give the buyer a credit at closing for taxes for the time you owned the home but don\u2019t get billed until well after you close on the home.\n\nIt appears that your lender paid part of the tax bill for the year in which you closed, and you might have needed to pay the balance of the taxes owed for that year. We think it\u2019s likely that your real estate taxes were due in the year you closed on the home, so your lender might have paid the taxes for the first half of 2018, and by the time you closed, you had to pay the tax bill for the balance of 2018.\n\nTake a look at your closing documents to see if your buyer reimbursed you for some of the tax money you paid. Here\u2019s how it might work: Let\u2019s say you paid the property taxes for all of 2018 and closed on the sale of your father\u2019s home on November 20, 2018. In jurisdictions where taxes are billed and paid for the same year, you would have paid for 12 months and the buyers should have paid you for the one month after closing.\n\nReal estate transactions are difficult to understand but at least there is (or should be) a paper trail explaining various expenses. Now that you have some distance between when you closed and today, you can go back and look at the detail and hopefully get your questions answered.\n\nFinally, while you found yourself in a difficult situation that seemed murky (at best!), it doesn't mean your attorney or real estate agent betrayed you. If you have family members or friends that have more knowledge of real estate transactions, talk to them and go over what you went through. If, after you talk to them, you still have issues, you might want to talk to a different attorney to get more advice.\n\nIlyce Glink is the author of \u201c100 Questions Every First-Time Home Buyer Should Ask\u201d (4th Edition).
