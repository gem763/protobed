Probably not. He\u2019s their golden goose, the man who singlehandedly made their platform relevant to the entire planet moment to moment. He can\u2019t be banned no matter what he does.\n\nBut could he be temporarily suspended, i.e. lose his posting privileges for 12 hours, or face some other reprimand? There was chatter somewhere not long ago about Twitter possibly installing a new feature in which tweets posted by, ahem, \u201cpublic officials\u201d that violate the platform\u2019s terms of service would be marked to indicate the violation but wouldn\u2019t be removed. The public interest in knowing what those \u2026 \u201cpublic officials\u201d are saying at a given moment is too high to justify erasing the tweet entirely.\n\nOmar\u2019s anticipating an argument like that, however, by emphasizing that she\u2019s received death threats after Trump\u2019s tweet this morning. If public reaction to a false tweet ends up putting someone in danger, doesn\u2019t Twitter have a responsibility to remove it?\n\nBut let\u2019s back up. Here\u2019s Trump\u2019s tweet:\n\nIIhan Omar, a member of AOC Plus 3, will win us the Great State of Minnesota. The new face of the Democrat Party! https://t.co/aQFEygSa4D \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nThe link at the end pointed to a tweet from MAGA superfan Terrence Williams that\u2019s now been deleted. What was in that tweet?\n\nMediaite has a copy. Turns out it was a video of Omar dancing at some event. \u201cGET THIS WOMAN OUT OF OFFICE,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cIlhan Omar partied on the anniversary of 9/11 because she believes \u2018Some People Just Did Somethings.'\u201d Is that right? Did Omar go dancing on 9/11? Because that would be insensitive.\n\nNot crazy insensitive, perhaps, like wanting to invite the Taliban to Camp David during the week of 9/11. But insensitive, especially given the attention to her \u201csome people did something\u201d remarks about 9/11 earlier this year.\n\nBut no, she didn\u2019t go dancing on 9/11. Jake Tapper blew the whistle:\n\n2/ The president of the United States RTs the lie to his 64.4 million followers that she was dancing on the anniversary of 9/11. It's completely false, it's a smear, and no doubt it raises security issues.https://t.co/4SjI4TUELb \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) September 18, 2019\n\nShe was dancing at a CBC party on Friday night. That explains why Williams\u2019s tweet is now gone. Either he deleted it when the lie was exposed or Twitter did. Tapper was right about security issues too, or so says Omar:\n\nThis is from a CBC event we hosted this weekend to celebrate black women in Congress. The President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk. What is Twitter doing to combat this misinformation? https://t.co/XdkRVrU7mZ \u2014 Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) September 18, 2019\n\nLefty groups are also demanding action:\n\nTwitter confirms to us they've removed the original lie @realDonaldTrump quote-tweeted. They must suspend Trump's account until he removes HIS tweet (as they did to Mitch McConnell recently in similar situation). Every minute, violence-inducing comments like this are spreading. https://t.co/8CBQzShZUe \u2014 BoldProgressives.org (@BoldProgressive) September 18, 2019\n\nWhy did Trump amplify Williams\u2019s claim that Omar went dancing on 9/11 without checking it out first? Well, because he\u2019s Trump. President Ron Burgundy will retweet an-y-thing you put in his Twitter timeline if it happens to agree with stuff he already believes. In fact, Williams turns out to be the same guy whom Trump retweeted last month after Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s suicide. \u201c#JefferyEpstein had information on Bill Clinton & now he\u2019s dead,\u201d wrote Williams, adding \u201cClintonBodyCount\u201d and \u201cClintonCrimeFamily\u201d at the end of his tweet. The president deemed that worthy enough to be broadcast to the world, never mind that Epstein died in the custody of his own DOJ. Frankly, given the sort of trashy conspiracy theories that are being tweeted at Trump every day by fans and foes, it\u2019s surprising that he doesn\u2019t get suckered by stuff like Omar dancing on 9/11 more often. He\u2019s never retweeted a QAnon claim, for instance, as far as I can remember. (Although I believe he has once or twice retweeted people with QAnon references in their Twitter usernames.)\n\nWill Twitter do something, though? I suspect not, and not just because he\u2019s their most powerful \u201cpower user.\u201d I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone suspended on the platform for simply retweeting or reposting a false claim made by someone else. Normally it\u2019s the source of the smear who\u2019s punished \u2014 maybe Williams will lose his account but probably not the people like Trump who promoted his claim. Possibly Twitter will revisit that standard in the aftermath of this incident, forcing people to double-check spurious allegations made by others before mindlessly retweeting them on penalty of losing their own posting privileges if they amplify something false. Although if they do that, righties like Josh Hawley who are eager to regulate Big Tech will turn around and accuse them of hypocrisy: \u201cWhy should Trump lose his privilege to post for amplifying Williams\u2019s smear when Twitter faces no accountability for amplifying that smear in the first place?\u201d That\u2019ll be a fun debate.", "description": "\"The President of the United States is continuing to spread lies that put my life at risk.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/io.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
