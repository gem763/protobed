Thompson International Airport during an evacuation operation after Hurricane Dorian hit the Abaco Islands in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, September 7, 2019. REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nAid groups rushed emergency help to the storm-ravaged islands, and officials warned a death toll of 43 was likely to spike higher as the number of missing among the archipelago nation\u2019s 400,000 residents becomes clear.\n\nEven as the aid ships and aircraft headed in, residents abandoned hard-hit Great Abaco Island to seek safety and food in the capital, Nassau, and others headed to Florida for shelter, supplies and perhaps jobs.\n\nSome 90 percent of the homes, buildings and infrastructure in Marsh Harbour of Great Abaco, where Dorian rampaged for almost two full days as one of the strongest Caribbean hurricanes on record, were damaged, the World Food Programme said.\n\nThe agency noted that thousands of people were living in a government building, a medical center and an Anglican church that survived the storms, but they had little to no access to water, power and sanitary facilities.\n\n\u201cThe needs remain enormous,\u201d WFP spokesman Herve Verhoosel said in an email. \u201cEvacuations are slowly taking place by ferry, as hundreds of residents reportedly flee daily.\u201d\n\nA cruise ship with more than 1,000 evacuees arrived in south Florida on Saturday. Some had small children or aging relatives who they hoped to find safe lodging for before returning to try to repair or rebuild their island homes.\n\nThe risk of outbreaks of diarrhea and waterborne diseases is high as drinking water may be tainted with sewage, according to the Pan American Health Organization.\n\nTravis Newton, a 32-year-old carpenter who survived the storm in Marsh Harbour, said he arrived in Nassau on Saturday morning with his family, trying to find a safe place to live.\n\nHe said residents of the town foraged for food and water in the wreckage of damaged stores after the storm passed.\n\n\u201cWe had to survive, we had to make it happen, we had to find food, water, where we were aid couldn\u2019t get to us, we had to find what we could from the damaged stores,\u201d Newton said. \u201cEverybody needs to get out of that place.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard and Navy were shipping in relief supplies and had already rescued some 290 people from isolated areas on the islands. The U.S. Agency for International Development said it raised its allocation of aid to the Bahamas by $1 million, to $2.8 million in total and had moved enough emergency supplies for 44,000 people to the islands.\n\nSome 70,000 people were in need of food and shelter, the WFP estimated, and private forecasters estimated that some $3 billion in insured property was destroyed or damaged in the Caribbean.\n\nUNUSUAL THIRD LANDFALL\n\nDorian remained a powerful threat. The storm on Saturday made an unusual third landfall when it slammed into Canada\u2019s Atlantic Coast, knocking down trees, cutting power and blowing over a large construction crane in downtown Halifax, the capital of the province of Nova Scotia.\n\nDorian was reclassified to a very intense post-tropical storm as it lost a defined eye though wind speeds of 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour) were equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said.\n\nThe system was racing north-eastward toward Prince Edward Island and was expected to pass over northern Newfoundland and eastern Labrador late Saturday or early Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said. Local authorities urged anyone who lived close to the seashore to evacuate as a precaution.\n\nDorian, proving to be a long-lived storm, hit the Bahamas on Sunday and Monday with Category 5 winds, with some gusts topping 200 miles per hour (320 kph).\n\nThe hurricane pounded parts of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks Islands on Friday, and Governor Roy Cooper on Saturday reported the death of a 67-year-old man in Pamlico County on the mainland coast, the state\u2019s second fatality in the storm.\n\nLARGE NUMBER OF DEAD FEARED\n\nIn the Bahamas, medical chief of staff at Princess Margaret Hospital in Nassau, Dr. Caroline Burnett-Garraway, said two refrigerated, 40-foot trucks would be needed to hold the \u201cstaggering\u201d number of bodies that were expected to be found.\n\n\u201cOur relief operation is growing, but we are also facing serious challenges in terms of delivering aid,\u201d Red Cross spokeswoman Jennifer Eli said. \u201cEven search-and-rescue choppers haven\u2019t been able to reach some people because there\u2019s no place to land.\u201d\n\nNear an area called The Mudd in Marsh Harbour, a Reuters witness reported most houses leveled, the body of a man lying near a main street and dead dogs floating in water.\n\nAmong those who fled Abaco was 19-year-old Isaiah Johnson, who was staying in a hotel in Nassau with his mother and three sisters after the storm\u2019s severe winds destroyed their homes.\n\nSlideshow (31 Images)\n\nA wealthy friend had paid for a two-week stay, but after that it was unclear where they would go.\n\nHis mother was already searching for work in the United States, Johnson said, reckoning that jobs would be hard to find in Nassau.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks might be enough time for me to figure things out,\u201d Johnson said on Saturday. \u201cFor my mom, I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d", "description": "Thousands of people fled devastation in the Bahamas on Saturday as conditions grew increasingly desperate nearly a week after Hurricane Dorian made landfall, reducing many homes to rubble and knocking out water and power.", "authors": ["Nick Brown", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427546144&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8700L", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
