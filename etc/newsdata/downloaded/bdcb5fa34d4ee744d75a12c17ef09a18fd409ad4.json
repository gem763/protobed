Pictured, microscope images of the plastic particles released from the bags\n\nAnalysing samples of the tiny plastic bits, the researchers found that the composition of the released particles matched that of the original teabags themselves, being made from nylon and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)\n\nIn a second experiment, the researchers exposed water fleas to various doses of the teabag-derived micro- and nanoplastics to see what effect such might have.\n\nWater fleas \u2014 or Daphnia magna \u2014 are model organisms that are often used in environmental studies.\n\nThe researchers found that, although the animals survived after exposure to the pollutants, they did show various anatomical and behavioural abnormalities.\n\nFor example, some of the fleas failed to develop a normal upper shell, instead forming an inflated balloon sack that ended up suspended over the animal.\n\nAdditionally, some of the polluted water fleas were seen to swim for much longer distances than their unaffected counterparts.\n\nThe researchers also found that water fleas exposed to the plastic debris from the teabags went on to grow abnormally and exhibit unusual behaviours\n\nThe exact impact of taking in such tiny debris in your tea, however, remains unclear.\n\n'The knowledge on adverse effects of plastic particles on human health is still lacking and there is an urgent need to investigate potential toxic mechanisms in higher vertebrates and humans,' the researchers concluded.\n\nThis, they added, will be of 'vital importance when assessing the human health risk of micro- and nanoplastics.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.", "description": "Chemical engineer Laura Hernandez and colleagues at Canada's McGill University purchased four different commercially-sold teas from coffee shops and grocery stores in Montreal for their analysis.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/25/12/18914442-0-image-a-37_1569410492084.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
