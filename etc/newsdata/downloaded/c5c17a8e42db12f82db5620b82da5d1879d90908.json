Thanks to Biden\u2019s regular gaffes, his age and mental wherewithal are more than an elephant in the room. They\u2019re an elephant in the room that keeps taking a dump on the floor. Finally someone noticed the smell! And then, under fire from the hypocritical press, denied having smelled it:\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro says he doesn't regret his clash with Joe Biden, in which he asked whether Biden was \"forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\" \"I wasn't taking a shot at his age,\" Castro tells @ABC News. \"It's about the health care policy.\"https://t.co/INdRXlIwFs #DemDebate pic.twitter.com/MPuSiJzo6O \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 13, 2019\n\nImagine Castro\u2019s confusion this morning at being savaged for his jab at Biden\u2019s alleged forgetfulness early in the debate despite the fact that Biden then went on to sound incoherent in that \u201crecord player\u201d answer that Ed flagged earlier.\n\nBut whatever, I shed no tears for the Castro boys. This is the second time in a month in which they\u2019ve taken a shot below the belt at someone and then professed angelic innocence afterward about what their intentions are. If the media wants to flog Julian for disrespecting Grandpa Joe, have at it. He deserves it if only for botching his attack on Biden so badly that fact-checkers afterward were forced to acknowledge that Biden, not Castro, was right on the substance of their exchange.\n\nFormer senator Claire McCaskill said, \u201cI think Castro\u2019s hurt. I think he was trying to swing for the fences\u2026 I\u2019m not sure anything tonight moved the needle except I think Castro offended people the way he did that. And it won\u2019t surprise me if it helps Biden.\u201d Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson added, \u201cI totally agree with what Claire said.\u201d For long stretches the debate seemed like Biden versus the fringes, and they were trying to get some sort of purchase. I think you understate the damage that Castro did to himself tonight. He would have lost a lot of support if he had a lot of support to lose. He didn\u2019t. He had a little support. I think it\u2019s basically over. He took a shot. It was not a good shot. And it just really went over like a lead balloon. That was a bad, bad moment for him.\u201d\n\nMeh. I think the jury\u2019s out on whether he helped or hurt himself on balance. Castro\u2019s not merely running to be VP, remember, he\u2019s running to be the VP of a particular candidate \u2014 Elizabeth Warren, the only member of the top tier whom he\u2019d \u201cbalance\u201d demographically on a ticket. He showed her last night that he\u2019s willing to go hard at her enemies. Whether he went a little too hard and made bitter enemies of Biden voters, who might not be thrilled with having to support Warren as nominee in the first place, remains to be seen. If so, he might have made himself too much of a liability to \u201cparty unity\u201d for her to put on a ticket. If not, he\u2019d make a fine attack dog against Trump in the general election, particularly given his Texas roots and his new status as one of the most well-known Latino pols in the country.\n\nIn the meantime, the competition is going to have fun knifing him over last night\u2019s exchange with Biden. Here\u2019s Beto, who ended up on the short end of an immigration exchange with Castro at the first debate, trying to elbow aside his fellow Texan and maybe pick up some of his voters. Castro doesn\u2019t seem too remorseful, though \u2014 he\u2019s actually fundraising off of the exchange with Biden this morning, portraying himself as a political hero-victim because of it. Exit quotation: \u201cI could either play it safe and give Vice President Biden a free pass like everyone else. Or I could speak up, challenge the conversation, and demand answers for you and your family\u2026 I spent every second on that stage fighting for you \u2013 and now I\u2019m being attacked for it.\u201d", "description": "\"I wasn't taking a shot at his age.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
