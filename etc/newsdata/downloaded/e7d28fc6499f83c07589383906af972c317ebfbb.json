Onassis wanted Simon, then 38, to write a memoir, but the singer demurred and asked to write children\u2019s books instead.\n\nOnassis agreed, and Simon wrote two children\u2019s books for Doubleday. The collaboration marked the start of Simon and Onassis\u2019 unlikely friendship, which lasted until Onassis\u2019 death from cancer at age 64 in 1994.\n\n\u201c[Onassis saw in me] something that she wanted to have a little bit of herself,\u201d Simon said. \u201cA free spirit, who had the license to be, in a rock and roll kind of way, loose as a goose. I could smoke a joint if I wanted to, and she didn\u2019t have the license to be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a naughty girl and she liked that in herself and she like that in other people,\u201d she added.\n\nSimon recounts other details about her friendship with Onassis in Touched by the Sun, published Tuesday. She said on Today that she never contacted Onassis\u2019 daughter, Caroline Kennedy, about the book.\n\n\u201cI thought about it often, and I thought, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ll wait until it\u2019s finished. If she objects to anything, I\u2019ll remediate.\u2019 But I never did call her,\u201d Simon said.\n\nSimon said she believes Onassis would have approved of the book, despite being a very private person.\n\n\u201cShe would have been very interested in herself. That goes along with her first mandate to me, which was to write a memoir about the interesting people that I knew. What better answer than to write about Jackie,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI never did call her,\u201d @CarlySimonHQ says about if she called Caroline Kennedy to tell her she was writing the book about Jackie Kennedy pic.twitter.com/FBAS8xCBbV\u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) October 22, 2019\n\nSimon remembered Onassis as \u201ca most extraordinary and fascinating beautiful woman\u201d in an Instagram post about Touched By the Sun in August.\n\n\u201cJackie was so feminine but she was immensely gutsy and smart and I loved writing about her and remembering so many of our interactions,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe was a wonderful friend, a great lady whose light was so bright as to light up the sky. I called the book Touched By The Sun for that very reason.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 22 (UPI) \u2014 \u201cWhat did she see in you?\u201d @CynthiaMcFadden asks @CarlySimonHQ about Jackie Kennedy \u201cSomething that she wanted to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
