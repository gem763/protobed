I know that\u2019s not a very round number in terms of anniversaries but I want to say that a) that seems like a lifetime ago, and I suppose it was for some people, and b) I wish they\u2019d do a remake or a sequel.\n\nGiven how Rockstar is nowadays with new GTA content I can\u2019t see it happening, although I do hold out hope that maybe when it gets to the 20th anniversary that maybe they\u2019ll reconsider. For the mixture of 80s tunes and attitude is the ultimate way to experience GTA. I know that doesn\u2019t make much sense, given the first game was in 1997 but there\u2019s just something about it that feels like the manifestation of every fantasy from an 80s action film.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m fine with most of the games being set in the present day but I wish there was always one that was current that was a period piece. Maybe at least have an 80s time travel zone or something in GTA Online? I mean, they\u2019ve got flying motorbikes so it would hardly be the strangest thing they\u2019ve done.\n\nGooch\n\nNostalgia cycle\n\nNice review of Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 but a bit disappointed to find it\u2019s trying to be more like Luigi\u2019s Mansion. In my opinion that\u2019s always been a pretty worthless game and I\u2019m not really sure what anyone else sees in it. Is it just nostalgia? Especially as it was around at the start of the GameCube? In my mind there\u2019s no question that Luigi\u2019s Mansion 2 is 100% the better game but I guess enough people disagree that Nintendo did it this way.\n\nI\u2019m not that upset, because it still seems to be a good game, but it just goes to show you what a hell of a drug nostalgia can be. It\u2019s not just a problem in games of course, almost everything is trying to remind you of some other thing you used to like or hoping you won\u2019t notice it\u2019s terrible just because it reminds you of something better you used to enjoy (Terminator: Dark Fate, anyone?).\n\nOne of the many problems is where do they go after that? Does Luigi\u2019s Mansion 4 try to evolve back into something closer to the second game? So by the time we\u2019re on Luigi\u2019s Mansion 5 we\u2019ll finally get something brand new? Who am I kidding? But the time it gets to 5 it\u2019ll be time to remind you of the first one again, that\u2019s the cycle of nostalgia!\n\nRolph\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPay to not play\n\nOver the weekend I had a conversation with one of Fallout 1st\u2019s \u2018whales\u2019 in a Reddit thread.\n\nThe most interesting thing to me was that this person did not even play the game anymore. They were paying the subscription in the hope that Bethesda would use their money to improve the game. Myself and others tried to point out that this person\u2019s actions were more likely to do the opposite, that they had in fact shown Bethesda that there were people out there willing to pay good money on rubbish which incentivised Bethesda not to improve their offering.\n\nThe person then went on to reveal that they had been buying the microtransactions regularly anyway, so they saw no difference in this subscription. When asked why they bought the microtransactions they said that they liked the previous Fallout games but found Fallout 76\u2019s approach too grindy for their available time and felt they had to spend money to keep up with others and make the experience more like the older games.\n\nWhen asked why they did not buy The Outer Worlds instead they said that they had a Game Pass subscription and did have the game but due to time constraints would not play it either. They seemed to know that The Outer Worlds was a more traditional Fallout type experience but might not have known it was developed by the people who made Fallout: New Vegas. Essentially, instead of playing The Outer Worlds on a subscription service they already had they were prepared to give Bethesda money in the hope that Bethesda would turn Fallout 76 into a more traditional Fallout game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe person also revealed that they subscribe to all of the major entertainment subscriptions like Netflix and Amazon Prime, even if they did not use those much either. They saw this as just the way things were now and didn\u2019t think Bethesda were doing anything wrong as all major gaming publishers offered subscriptions, microtransactions, and loot boxes.\n\nPazJohnMitch\n\nPS: I found it very difficult to write this letter without going off on a Jim Sterling style rant about Triple-A monitory practices and how they prey on naive people.\n\nGC: They sound they like have some serious issues, that we suspect they\u2019re not seeking help for.\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nMadness of crowds\n\nI\u2019ve got a feeling BlizzCon this weekend is going to be a blood bath for Blizzard. Their blood is in the water and it\u2019s cool to hate them at the moment, so I don\u2019t think all these sequels announcements are going to do anything. We\u2019ll see I guess but I think there is some truth to the idea that a lot of fans enjoy complaining about games more than they do actually playing them.\n\nOr to put it another way the pack mentality is something they enjoy, getting themselves hyped or pumping themselves up into a fury is something that makes you feel connected and powerful in a way a game can\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m above it, definitely the hype part where you immediately set yourself up for a fall, but from a distance it can seem quite scary.\n\nWolfie\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy not both?\n\nI haven\u2019t played it yet but reading your review of the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare campaign it would appear as though Infinity Ward are not only going for shock value but trying to make a semi-point about war as well.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to talk about Call Of Duty campaigns and not mention the No Russian level from the 2009 game, which I played much later than release. Because I had heard so much about it beforehand, when I reached that point I guess I had already been desensitised so didn\u2019t find it as shocking as the developers probably wanted me to. However, out of all the Call Of Duty campaigns I\u2019ve played, one part that did shock me, and in fact I think is the most shocking moment I\u2019ve experienced in gaming, was at the end of the first mission of the Black Ops 3 campaign.\n\nYou\u2019re trying to escape a complex and reach a part where you\u2019re overwhelmed fighting military robots. One floors you then proceeds to tear off your arms, breaks your leg then punches you to near death. Watching this in first person was quite horrific. Particularly the way the robot was so merciless and cold, without conscience and didn\u2019t stopping at simply killing the character you played in a more humane way.\n\nMaybe Treyarch were trying to make a point about robot soldiers in the future might not be such a good thing because of the lack of humanity\u2026 or maybe they were just doing it for the gore!\n\nPsillyPseudonym\n\nSad agreement\n\nI have to agree with your review of WWE 2K20 (and I\u2019m a staunch apologist every year) but between the awful remapping of the buttons, hard crashes, bugs, and glitches I can\u2019t believe they didn\u2019t delay it for some polish.\n\nBeen playing The Outer Worlds this weekend but only about an hour a session because that first person view just makes me feel beyond nauseous. This, I feel, is why I haven\u2019t made the dip into VR this gen.\n\nI\u2019ve certainly been smashing everyone\u2019s brains in at every opportunity (and probably making it a lot harder for myself in the process!) because I always took the high road in Fallout and I thought it\u2019d be fun to be the bad guy \u2013 anyone else taking approach or am I just deliciously evil right now?\n\nOn a side note, does anyone know if you can make the menu bigger on Xbox One as I find the text is tiny and I\u2019m struggling to read anything/make use of the item system properly.\n\nOne of my biggest bugbears so far is its waypoint system, it tells me 200m forward, for example, but you can\u2019t go 200m forward because there are buildings/invisible walls, etc. in the way and I\u2019m a person who takes directions literally so you can imagine how infuriating I am finding it.\n\nTheSpectre N8 (gamertag)\n\nPS: RE: the weekend Hot Topic about non-violent games. Surely there is only one answer for this, the Rock Band/Guitar Hero series of games. I\u2019m really surprised nobody picked these and it teaches me, as per usual, to send it in because unexpectedly nobody else did.\n\nMore before you start\n\nI realise it\u2019s only just come out and I\u2019ve not even got around to picking it up yet, but I was wondering if you knew if there were any plans for any Fallout style expansion DLC for The Outer Worlds?\n\nI\u2019m interested in it either way and, despite my nearly 30 game backlog, I\u2019d have probably bought it already if it wasn\u2019t for my recent PlayStation VR outlay, but I was just curious.\n\nyourhomeisatrisk\n\nGC: To our knowledge they haven\u2019t said anything about DLC one way or the other.\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nSmall screen entertainment\n\nI was sceptical about The Witcher 3 on the Nintendo Switch even after reading your review. I played it on original release a few years ago but never got to finish it.\n\nWith the clocks going back and the cold long nights drawing in I thought it\u2019d be a perfect game to play in handheld whilst nice and cosy in bed.\n\nI got my copy for \u00a346 from Argos (game were charging \u00a352) on Saturday afternoon, got home and thought, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to take it back, it\u2019s going to have too many compromises, it\u2019s going to ruin my memories of a true classic\u2019.\n\nThen I read your review again and quickly took the wrapping off and inserted the cartridge before I could change my mind again.\n\nI was gob-smacked\u2026. mind blown. A few years ago I was playing this on the original Xbox One, a huge ugly brick of a console and now I\u2019m playing it on a portable. On the small Switch screen it more or less looks and plays exactly how I remember it, only it\u2019s better because I can take it with me and soon I\u2019ll be able to play it whilst watching the new Netflix adaptation.\n\nOn another note, I really cannot wait for Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3, I\u2019ve got it on pre-order with ShopTo and I also got Astral Chain two days early from them, so here\u2019s hoping!\n\nwasimr34\n\nInbox also-rans\n\nI\u2019m not sure I really see the point of that Xbox upgrade system. The amount you\u2019d pay in interest and all the messing around\u2026 I think I\u2019ll just sell my old console on eBay, the old fashioned way.\n\nCaster\n\nNice review of Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3. I already bought the game a while ago along with Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening via download on Nintendo eShop. But at the of your review there wasn\u2019t a score, nor pros and cons.\n\nwoz_007 (NN ID)\n\nGC: That\u2019s odd, it\u2019s definitely there now.\n\nThis week\u2019s Hot Topic It\u2019s Halloween this week so the subject for this weekend\u2019s Inbox is a simple one: what\u2019s the most scared you\u2019ve ever been when playing a video game? It doesn\u2019t have to have been while playing a horror game, it could just be an unexpectedly scary moment in a normal game or maybe even something that the developer didn\u2019t seem to intend to be frightening. Do you enjoy scary video games and do you think they\u2019re more or less effective than movies and TV? Please remember that normal house rules apply for the Halloween Hot Topic: nobody\u2019s allowed to mention the dogs jumping through the window bit in Resident Evil 1.
