It had all the signs of a bubble, complete with shady promoters, a speculative frenzy and investors with precious little knowledge piling into the market. I was a vocal bear at the time, but no longer. There has never been a greater need for a stateless currency and store of value held outside the financial system.\n\nSure, Bitcoin behaves a bit more like an asset than a currency at this point; there's not much you can buy with it, and most people intend to simply buy and hold it forever. And the \"forever\" part doesn't really make any sense, with the die-hard crypto fans thinking that someday there will be no cash and we will just be zipping Bitcoin around between our phones to pay for things. Maybe. Admittedly, it hasn't been a terrific store of value, as it is prone to getting vaporised fairly frequently. Perhaps it is a feature, not a bug.\n\nThe more immediate issue for me is that the philosophical basis for fiat currencies has never been more fragile. No politician in the U.S. is talking about the need to shrink what are becoming very large budget deficits, with the possibility that they can only be financed directly by central banks. This is known as Modern Monetary Theory, or the printing of as much cash as a government needs to fund its spending.\n\nGovernments can print currencies, but not Bitcoin. You can mine it, but there is not much mining left to do. Governments can't print gold, either, though I suppose we could discover a lot more of it. Despite an almost doubling in dollars outstanding since before the financial crisis to $US15 trillion as measured by M2 to pay for three rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, there is no inflation. In fact, the concern is deflation. I'm not smart enough to figure out why it played out this way, but it just seems like common sense that you would want to avoid any currency that is being debased to such a degree.\n\nThe promise of the Internet was real, and over 20 years that promise came to be realised, and a real bull market-not a bubble-developed\n\nWe are very early in the 2020 presidential campaign. The types of things we are talking about-student loan forgiveness, medical debt forgiveness, Medicare for all, a wealth tax-would require bond issuance that might not easily be absorbed by the capital markets. Of course, even that idea seems ludicrous today, as debt outstanding has tripled and interest rates have done nothing but go down. We seem to be past the point where we worry about paying for stuff.", "description": "There has never been a greater need for a stateless currency and store of value held outside the financial system.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7947%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_455/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/319234a4e3cd83dd89612492345d3c3615626770", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
