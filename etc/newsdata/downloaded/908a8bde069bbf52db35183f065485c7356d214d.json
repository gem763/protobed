(Al SpaceFactory says its currently working on a plan for interested people to book a night when its crowdfunding campaign sells out.)\n\nAI SpaceFactory designed the original version of the habitat, called Marsha, for a 3D-printed planetary habitat contest by NASA and won first place. The only difference between the two habitats is that Marsha was built exclusively using fiber from a type of rock abundant on Mars called basalt, while Tera also uses other materials found on Earth, like fiberglass. Most of the materials used to build Tera are biodegradable and recyclable.\n\nAl SpaceFactory hopes to one day make Tera-related projects for commercial use here on Earth and use it as a revenue stream to fund its space-related projects. The company says that several interested parties, including music festivals, have already been in contact to ask about building structures similar to Tera, but no projects are yet in the works.\n\nAl SpaceFactory says its mission is to eliminate the use of traditional materials such as concrete, which negatively impacts the environment.\n\nHere's what Tera will look like what it's completed, according to AI SpaceFactory's renderings of the project.\n\nThe two-story cabin will be nestled in the woods with views of the Hudson River.", "description": "New York City-based architecture firm Al SpaceFactory is taking the NASA-award winning 3D-printed cabin it designed for life on Mars to upstate New York.
