Officials with knowledge of Lee\u2019s itinerary said his office recently informed Tokyo when - and in what kind of format - Lee wishes to meet Abe.Local officials said they would fine-tune details of the meeting after Abe\u2019s office responds to the proposal.The high-level official in Lee\u2019s office said the Korean government initially tried to send President Moon to the enthronement ceremony but that Japan \u201cindirectly\u201d turned down that offer. Instead, the Japanese government apparently wanted Prime Minister Lee to come, the official continued, because they thought it would be difficult to \u201creach a conclusion\u201d at this point if Moon were to come and hold a summit with Abe.The last time that Moon and Abe met was in September 2018, before the Korean Supreme Court ordered two Japanese companies to compensate Korean victims of forced labor during World War II.Other sources said Lee\u2019s office was trying to arrange a meeting between former Japanese prime ministers and with Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party. Lee is also expected to meet numerous figures from the Japanese political and economic sectors, as well as civic groups.During an Upper House meeting on Wednesday, Abe steadfastly urged Seoul to stop violating international law but added that both countries need to continuously talk with each other.A director general-level meeting between the two countries was held at the Korean Foreign Ministry in Seoul the same day to discuss issues including Japan\u2019s export restrictions and the forced labor rulings.Kim Jung-han, the director general for Asian and Pacific affairs, held talks with his Japanese counterpart, Shigeki Takizaki, who earlier had lunch with Seoul\u2019s top nuclear envoy Lee Do-hoon.BY BAEK MIN-JEONG, LEE SUNG-EUN [lee.sungeun@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/16195758.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
