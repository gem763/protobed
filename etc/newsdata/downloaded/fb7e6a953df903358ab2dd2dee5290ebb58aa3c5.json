Mitigating strategies can only go so far because factory capacity outside China is getting increasingly constrained and concessions are not an optimal long-term solution,\u201d says long-time Bank of America Merrill Lynch retail analyst Lorraine Hutchinson.\n\nIn short, retailers are caught between a rock and hard place right now.\n\nThe chaos ensues\n\nThe Trump administration slapped China with fresh 15% tariffs on some $125 billion of largely consumer products on September 1. Whereas products such as smart speakers, T-shirts and footwear side-stepped the first round of tariffs, they weren\u2019t so lucky to get a reprieve this go around.\n\nRoughly 77% of all shoes, clothes and home textile imports to the U.S. from China now has a tariff attached to it, according to research by the American Apparel and Footwear Association. More tariffs on apparel and footwear lurk on December 15.\n\nIn this photo taken Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2019, Jennifer Lee, whose family owns Footprint shoe story in San Francisco, stands by a wall of athletic shoes, many of which are made in China and will be subject to new US tariffs on Chinese goods starting Sept 1.

They have used most of the year to reconfigure their supply chains, moving as much production as possible out of China to other regions such as India and Vietnam. Back-to-school merchandise and some holiday assortments were also brought in early to warehouses this summer so as to avoid the tariff increases.\n\nDue to these Herculean efforts, the effects of the trade war did not materially hurt the earnings of major retailers in the first half of the year. Hat tip to the executives just making it happen.\n\nEven still, Hutchinson points to two harsh realities despite the efforts of retailers to protect their profits.\n\nFor one, apparel and footwear sourcing costs are now starting to rise following a six-year stretch of flat to lower costs. Thank you, Trump trade war, which is causing supply chain disruption across many industries that have relied on China for decades.\n\nIt\u2019s inefficiency in its finest form for an industry that could least afford it.\n\nSays Hutchinson, \u201cWe expect costs to rise over the next several years because Trade War has accelerated the supply chain shift across multiple industries, creating tight capacity and an inflationary environment around key manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia. We see risk that even a modest annual increase in sourcing costs could pressure margins for many brands given apparel pricing remains deflationary.\u201d\n\nNo relief even in Vietnam\n\nNext, one of the primary beneficiaries of apparel retailers shifting their production has been Vietnam. Unfortunately, other industries (see tech hardware and semiconductors) have also descended onto the emerging market to source products. That is beginning to significantly drive up costs in Vietnam, says Hutchinson, surprising many in the retail industry who thought the country would give it some cost relief.\n\n\u201cWhile minimum wages are only rising 5% year-over-year in Vietnam in 2019, our checks indicate wages for factory employees around the key cities (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City) are now rising at a low-double digit rate. Suppliers are struggling to recruit and train new employees fast enough to keep up with orders and vendor corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives limit weekly and annual overtime for existing employees,\u201d Hutchinson warns.", "description": "Thank you, Trump trade war for some pre-holiday shopping season chaos.", "authors": ["Brian Sozzi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lrSWuL_in3mGeDXLGfd56g--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/4d423110-dd70-11e9-bdcb-2db683597919", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
