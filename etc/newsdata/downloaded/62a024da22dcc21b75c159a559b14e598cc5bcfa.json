If Thankyou entities were to be wound up, anything surplus would go straight through to the Charitable Trust.\n\nLast year the enterprise spent $4.56million on employing its 47 staff including wages, super, payroll tax and other expenses (stock image; not actual employees)\n\n'The distribution was lower in 2018 given challenges the business faced when it launched into the New Zealand market whilst managing the existing category expansion and aggressive competitor activity.'\n\nShe went on to say that profit was held back to 'remain solvent and ensure working capital for things like purchasing inventory and all other standard business costs'.\n\n'One of the challenges with our very low retained earnings is we are going against bigger FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) competitors who have very deep pockets.\n\n'This is a challenge we\u2019ve had to manage throughout the Thankyou journey. If the business were to ever cease operations everything would go to the Charitable Trust.'\n\nDaily Mail has contacted Thankyou for further comment.", "description": "The social enterprise Thankyou, set up in Melbourne in 2008, sells bottled water, personal care and baby care products to raise money for charity.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/04/20018336-0-image-a-49_1571715849753.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
