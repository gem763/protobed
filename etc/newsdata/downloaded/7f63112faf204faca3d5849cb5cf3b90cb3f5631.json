Liberty\" as they marched through Sabadell, the hometown of some of the arrested separatists.\n\nPolice said 12,000 people demonstrated.\n\nSupporters of independence for Spain's Catalonia region claim the arrests are an attempt to criminalize a movement that's been overwhelmingly peaceful.\n\nThe seven were arrested Monday on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization, manufacturing explosives and conspiring to wreak havoc.\n\nA National Court judge ordered them to remain jailed Thursday. The judge said they are thought to be linked to radical groups that organized protests and blocked roads and train lines.\n\nAlso Saturday, Spanish newspaper ABC reported that one of the arrested separatists had contacts with Catalonia's regional president Quim Torra about alleged plans to occupy the regional parliament building in Barcelona. The report cited investigators.\n\nTorra's office said they don't give any credibility to the news report.\n\nSeparately, the Supreme Court is expected to rule in coming weeks in the case against 12 leaders of Catalonia's failed 2017 secession attempt. A guilty verdict with harsh sentences would likely spark more protests in Catalonia.\n\nPolls and recent elections show that the 7.5 million residents of the wealthy Catalonia region are roughly split even on the independence issue.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
