But Barty made 13 unforced errors in the second set as Martic leveled the match. Martic also broke in the opening game of the decider, but Barty broke straight back and then took a decisive 5-3 lead before serving out the match.\n\n\u201cI think it could have gone either way,\u201d Barty said. \u201cI was happy how I was able to fight in the end, put a lot of pressure on her in a lot of those service games in the third.\u201d\n\nIn a rematch of the 2018 semifinals, Barty will play defending champion Aryna Sabalenka, who defeated Kazakhstan\u2019s Elena Rybakina 6-3, 1-6, 6-1.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s No. 1 right now. It\u2019s going to be interesting to play against her. For sure it\u2019s going to be tough match, but I\u2019m looking forward for it,\u201d Sabalenka said.\n\nOn the other side of the bracket, two-time Wuhan Open champion Petra Kvitova beat Ukraine\u2019s Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-4 to reach the semis. Kvitova will next face unseeded American Alison Riske, who upset No. 3-seeded Elina Svitolina 6-1, 6-3.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Top-ranked Ash Barty reached the semifinals of the Wuhan Open for the third straight year by beating Petra Martic of Croatia 7-6 (6), 3-6, 6-3 on Thursday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
