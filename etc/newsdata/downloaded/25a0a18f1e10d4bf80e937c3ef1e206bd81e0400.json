General Assembly in New York by the time Parliament resumes on Wednesday.\n\n\"I strongly disagree with this decision of the Supreme Court. I have the upmost respect for our judiciary, I don't think this was the right decision,\" Johnson said in New York. \"I think that the prorogation (suspension of Parliament) has been used for centuries without this kind of challenge.\"\n\nUK PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON SAYS TRUMP IS THE 'ONE GUY' WHO CAN GET 'BETTER DEAL' WITH IRAN\n\nJohnson did not rule out trying to suspend Parliament again.\n\n\"As the law currently stands, the U.K. leaves the EU on Oct. 31st come what may, but the exciting thing for us now is to get a good deal. And that is what we are working on,\" Johnson said. \"And, to be honest, it is not made much easier by this kind of stuff in Parliament or in the courts.\"\n\nIn a remarkable decision, the U.K. Supreme Court unanimously declared that Johnson\u2019s order to close Parliament earlier this month was \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d and that his government had instead shut down the legislature in an effort to squelch debate on Britain\u2019s divorce from the European Union.\n\n\u201cThe suspension was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification,\u201d Supreme Court President Brenda Hale said in a statement.\n\nUK PM BORIS JOHNSON DENIES LYING TO QUEEN AS HE STRUGGLES TO GET BREXIT DONE\n\nImmediately after the landmark ruling, opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn led the calls for Johnson\u2019s resignation.\n\n\u201cI invite Boris Johnson, in the historic words, to consider his position,\u201d he said during a party conference Tuesday, adding that Johnson should \u201cbecome the shortest-serving prime minister there\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Scottish National Party legislator Joanna Cherry said: \"His position is untenable and he should have the guts for once to do the decent thing and resign.\u201d\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow welcomed the historic verdict and said Parliament would resume its business Wednesday morning.\n\nHe said the ruling \u201cvindicated the right and duty of Parliament to meet at this crucial time to scrutinize the executive and hold ministers to account.\u201d\n\nBORIS JOHNSON COMPARES BRITAIN TO THE INCREDIBLE HULK AMIDST BREXIT BATTLE\n\nIn a country without a written constitution, the case marked a rare confrontation between the prime minister, the courts and Parliament over their rights and responsibilities.\n\nIt revolved around whether Johnson acted lawfully when he advised the queen to suspend Parliament for five weeks during a crucial time frame before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline when Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union.\n\nParliament erupted into chaos earlier this month after following through with Johnson\u2019s threat to suspend the legislature. Days later, legal challenges were issued against Johnson\u2019s government for allegedly \u201cstymieing Parliament\u201d with the suspension.\n\nThe government's opponents argued that Johnson illegally shut down Parliament just weeks before the country is due to leave the 28-nation bloc for the \"improper purpose\" of dodging lawmakers' scrutiny of his Brexit plans.\n\nThey also accused Johnson of misleading the queen, whose formal approval was needed to suspend the legislature.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe court rejected the government's assertions that the decision to suspend Parliament until Oct. 14 was routine and not related to Brexit. Government lawyers claimed that under Britain's unwritten constitution, it is a matter for politicians, not courts, to decide.\n\nThe court decision Tuesday followed three days of hearings last week.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is refusing to step down amid growing calls for his resignation from leading politicians after the United Kingdom\u2019s high court ruled that his suspension of Parliament amid debate over Brexit\u00a0was illegal.", "authors": ["Lucia Suarez Sang"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19241452527043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
