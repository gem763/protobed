They write:\n\nCalifornia will have to collect itself once again after another destructive and deadly wildfire season. But recovery is not just about donating to relief efforts and rebuilding burned homes. It\u2019s also about creating a new culture for forest and fire management in the state, one that respects the role that carefully planned fires play in preventing disasters.\n\nBut as the Little Hoover Commission notes, the federal government owns a majority of California\u2019s forests, which limits what the state can do on its own.\n\nCalifornia needs major land-use reform\n\nAs Kendra Pierre-Louis has reported for The Times, many of California\u2019s deadliest and costliest fires (including the catastrophic Camp Fire last year, the worst in the state\u2019s history) start not in the heart of isolated forests but at the wildland-urban interface, where developed and undeveloped land meet.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2010, roughly one million homes were built at this flammable frontier, often making prescribed burns there impossible and fires more likely. To address the risks of this expansion, some people stress the need for developers to comply with fire-safe building codes. But The Los Angeles Times editorial board writes that this is not enough. The state should also consider limiting new development in fire-prone areas \u2014 an idea Gov. Gavin Newsom has opposed. The board writes:\n\nOf course existing homes have to become more resilient in the face of wind-driven blazes. And California may need to invest in more firefighting personnel and equipment to deal with the worsening fires. But it is folly to think that stricter building codes and more fire engines can eliminate the danger we create by building and rebuilding in high-fire-risk areas.\n\nAs The New York Times editorial board has pointed out, California\u2019s sprawl is also a result of a housing crisis that has pushed people out of the state\u2019s increasingly unaffordable cities. Prohibitions against building in fire-prone areas would therefore require a strong legislative effort to build denser, affordable housing in urban economic centers.\n\nThe problem is out of California\u2019s control\n\nCalifornia\u2019s struggle to prevent wildfires reflects a national crisis on climate change, writes Carolyn Kormann for The New Yorker. As climate change fuels wildfires nationwide, California represents a kind of best-case scenario for trying \u2014 and in many ways failing \u2014 to solve problems that may soon confront the rest of the nation.\n\nCalifornia has some of the country\u2019s most ambitious climate policies, but even those are insufficient. To make matters worse, forest fires release enormous amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, counteracting whatever progress the state has managed to make. \u201cAll the other efforts we do to diminish greenhouse gases through regulations for cars, trucks and businesses get wiped out by these fires,\u201d Assemblyman Jim Wood told Ms. Kormann. She writes:\n\nCalifornia is a wealthy, Democratic state, and it\u2019s experiencing some of the most devastating impacts of climate change in the country, but local politics and sparring special-interest groups have been impediments to needed climate-adaptation legislation. Passing such bills will be harder in more conservative states and at the federal level, especially while Trump is in office, and increasingly difficult as climate conditions worsen.\n\nThat is to say nothing about the rest of the world, which produces 85 percent of global carbon emissions and, like the United States, shows no real signs of cutting back. And even if greenhouse gas emissions ceased tomorrow, the globe would continue to warm by about half a degree because it has yet to adjust to the carbon dioxide that has already been added to the atmosphere. \u201cWe have to realize, I believe,\u201d Mr. Wood said, \u201cthat this is our new reality.\u201d\n\nWHAT TO WATCH\n\nOn Monday night, The Times reported that the Kincade fire had grown to twice the size of San Francisco. To the south, a separate fire that had broken out Monday morning in western Los Angeles forced 10,000 people, including LeBron James, to evacuate.", "description": "Wildfires are creating a chronic emergency for the state \u2014 and it\u2019s only getting worse.", "authors": ["Spencer Bokat-Lindell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/10/opinion/1029debatable/1029debatable-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
