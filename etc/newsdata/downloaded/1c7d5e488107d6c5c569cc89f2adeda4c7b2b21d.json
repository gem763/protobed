Large employers would also have to pay for health insurance.\n\nThis would be a significant development in workplace law and could eventually have implications for workers and companies across the country.\n\nThe proposed change is of keen interest to a rapidly growing population of contractors like Leonardo Diaz. For most of the past 4 1/2 years, he has made a decent living working 40 to 50 hours a week driving for Uber and Lyft.\n\n\"I love interacting with people,\" says the father of four, who lives in Los Angeles.\n\nBut more recently, Diaz has soured on his job. He says that both ride-hailing companies cut his share of payments, reducing his take-home pay to only $9 an hour, after taking the cost of gas, insurance and car repairs into account. Diaz has tried to boost his profits by trading in his gas-powered Hyundai Elantra for a similar hybrid vehicle.\n\nBut he says the bigger problem is that he is tired of working as a contractor and misses employee health and paid leave benefits he used to receive when he worked as a valet.\n\n\"We don't get any holiday pay,\" Diaz says. \"If we get sick, you know, nobody's going to pay for our doctors.\"\n\nContractors like Diaz make up a fast-growing part of the workforce. And any company in California using them \u2014 think Amazon or FedEx \u2014 could be affected. The change could also upend the business models of companies such as Instacart or TaskRabbit that have made gig work readily available in recent years.\n\nAnd the impact of the new law would reverberate beyond the state.\n\n\"Everyone is looking to California right now and they're all following it with bated breath because they recognize that likely whatever happens in California is going to sweep across the country,\" says Monique Ngo-Bonnici, a private attorney who represents businesses.\n\nThe proposal expands on a landmark California Supreme Court ruling last year that extended wage protections to more workers and narrowed the definition of \"independent contractor.\" The legislative proposal expands on that ruling and would give workers benefits like paid sick leave and protections under anti-discrimination laws.\n\nNgo-Bonnici argues that the California proposal would put big constraints on workers and companies alike. Specifically, it would mean more workers will be put on shifts, which in certain municipalities must be scheduled weeks in advance \u2014 giving workers far less flexibility, she says.\n\nLyft confirms it would have to revamp its operations in the state if drivers are reclassified as employees.\n\n\"We would need far fewer drivers than we currently have,\" says Adrian Durbin, a Lyft spokesman. And those that remained would have a much more rigid work schedule.\n\nDurbin says Lyft and other similar gig companies pushed California lawmakers for a middle ground that would grant independent contractors a narrower set of benefits, like minimum wage guarantees, without making them full-fledged employees.\n\nThose prospects dimmed after California Gov. Gavin Newsom this week publicly endorsed the measure.\n\nThe companies are not giving up the fight. Uber, Lyft and DoorDash have all pledged to spend $30 million each on a ballot initiative next year that would give them exemptions.\n\nBut Lorena Gonzalez, the San Diego lawmaker who sponsored the bill, doesn't think gig companies should be exempt.\n\n\"What they'd like is to say, basically, if you're hired through an app that there's something different ... and maybe some of the laws should apply but a lot of the laws shouldn't, and I think that's ridiculous,\" Gonzalez says. \"It's dangerous to say if you're hired through an app, you're somehow different because pretty soon we'll all be hired through an app.\"\n\nGonzalez argues that for too long, some companies skirted their financial and legal responsibilities to their workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors. Those who haven't been doing that, she says, support her proposal.\n\n\"I think a company that's doing the right thing is like, 'Finally, I'm not going to be undercut by a company that cheats their workers,' \" she says.\n\nDiaz, the Uber and Lyft driver, says he is pinning a lot of hopes on the proposal's passage, hoping it will improve pay and working conditions and pave the way toward forming a union. If it passes, the law will take effect in January.", "description": "California lawmakers are expected to approve a proposal to reclassify Uber drivers and other contract workers in the state as employees, giving them more rights and benefits at employers' expense.", "authors": ["Yuki Noguchi"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/23/leonard-diaz-by-victor-cuevas_wide-feb1e2513e1e29100e2136fad776cac81a361f5d.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
