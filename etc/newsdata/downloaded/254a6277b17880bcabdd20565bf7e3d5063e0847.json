But that violation was also dismissed when a judge with the city\u2019s Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings determined that the business took up less than 25 percent of the space in the apartment, which is permissible. Fortunetelling requires a modest footprint \u2014 two chairs and a crystal ball.\n\nThe psychic parlor had existed in this way for almost a decade when the woman who had lost her job as a recruiter happened by on the way home from shopping in May 2018. She had recently undergone abdominal surgery to remove a precancerous growth and was feeling overwhelmed, she said. That\u2019s when Ms. Mitchell, showing concern, offered a reading.\n\n\u201cIf someone tells me a miracle is coming at the end of the journey, I believe them,\u201d the woman said in an interview. By the end of the visit, she had paid $80 for a palm and face reading and an additional $150 in advance for Ms. Mitchell\u2019s \u201cresearch.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gave me a small bottle of gold dust which she said to bathe in, to calm down my energy,\u201d the woman later wrote in a statement to the police.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Mitchell summoned the woman back to the apartment. They spoke as Ms. Mitchell\u2019s two young children played underfoot. She said she had discovered the woman\u2019s troubled past lives \u2014 three of them . To cleanse her energy, Ms. Mitchell needed to light a candle for each of the 42 years of the woman\u2019s current life. Each candle cost $90 (Ms. Mitchell told her they were large).\n\nThe woman paid her $3,780, she told the police.\n\nThere were more meetings, more evil spirits to be warded off with expensive tools, like a wax statue of the woman (to come from a supplier in Tunisia) and a special crown. Ms. Mitchell told her that her parents were at risk, and that her boyfriend was not her soul mate. The woman kept her dealings with Ms. Mitchell a secret from her boyfriend, she said.\n\nThere would be one more payout, a whopper at $30,000, which Ms. Mitchell said was needed to finish their work. \u201cShe said, \u2018You\u2019ve already spent this much,\u2019\u201d the woman recalled in an interview this week, requesting anonymity because she was the victim of a crime. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s all wasted if you don\u2019t continue.\u2019\u201d", "description": "Three women operating out of the same fortunetelling shop were arrested and forced to repay their victims up to $60,000 apiece.
