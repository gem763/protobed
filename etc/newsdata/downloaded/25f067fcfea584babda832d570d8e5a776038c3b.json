It\u2019s time to put your creative code and confidence where your mouth is, my friends. Come to Disrupt Berlin 2019 on 11-12 December and pit your skills, tenacity and endurance against some of the best creators from around the world.\n\nWe\u2019re limiting participation to 500 people, and seats are filling fast. Get yours before they\u2019re gone. Apply to compete in the TC Hackathon today!\n\nWhy submit an application? For starters, it doesn\u2019t cost a thing to apply or to compete. In fact, if you make the grade, you\u2019ll receive a free Innovator pass to Disrupt Berlin and have access to everything Disrupt has to offer. But wait, as they say, there\u2019s more.\n\nThe Hackathon is not only a great opportunity to build a working prototype that addresses real-world problems, it\u2019s the chance to showcase your talent and creativity in front of people who have the potential move your ideas, career or startup forward. Each sponsored challenge comes with its own set of prizes, which typically includes cash and/or related products. On top of any sponsor prizes you might win, TechCrunch will award a $5,000 prize to the best over-all hack.\n\nWe\u2019ll announce the sponsors in the coming weeks. But for now, the sponsored contests, prizes and winners from the Hackathon at Disrupt SF 2018 will give you an idea of what you can expect.\n\nTeams will choose a project to hack, and they\u2019ll have less than 24 hours to design, build and present their product. If you arrive solo, you can find a team onsite. It\u2019s a pressure-cooker situation that requires focus, coding and problem-solving skills and perseverance. Here\u2019s the good news. We\u2019ll have plenty of food, water and lots of caffeine to help you go the distance.\n\nThe first round of judging takes place science-fair style. The judges will review all completed projects and then select only 10 teams to move on to the finals. The finals take place on day two, and teams have just two minutes to step onto the Extra Crunch Stage to present and pitch their work.\n\nSponsors will award prizes to the team(s) for their specific project, and then TechCrunch will choose one finalist as the best over-all hack. That team earns the championship title and $5,000 cash. Sweet!\n\nTC Hackathon takes place during Disrupt Berlin 2019 on 11-12 December. There are so many great reasons to apply, but seats are going fast. Grab this opportunity for all it\u2019s worth and apply to the Hackathon today.\n\nIs your company interested in sponsoring or exhibiting at Disrupt Berlin 2019?
