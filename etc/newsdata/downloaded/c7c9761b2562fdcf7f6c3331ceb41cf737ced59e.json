The vehicle that struck and killed the pedestrian had identified the need to apply the brakes, the report said.\n\nThe preliminary report disclosed the vehicle\u2019s radar systems observed the pedestrian six seconds before impact but \u201cthe self-driving system software classified the pedestrian as an unknown object, as a vehicle, and then as a bicycle with varying expectations of future travel path.\u201d", "description": "The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will hold a Nov. 19 hearing to determine the probable cause of a March 2018 Uber Technologies Inc self-driving vehicle crash that killed a pedestrian in Arizona.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441993294&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1TK", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
