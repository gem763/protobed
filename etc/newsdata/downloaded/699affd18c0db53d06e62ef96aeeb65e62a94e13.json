And if kids aren\u2019t filming themselves at school, they\u2019re making jokes about school. One popular meme on the app mocks the class of 2023 (freshmen this year) for being cringey and trying too hard.\n\n\u201cTikTok is such a theatrical platform,\u201d said Blake Cadwell, the general manager of Day One agency, a marketing firm in Los Angeles that works on Chipotle\u2019s TikTok account. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to build your cast for whatever you\u2019re doing, and high school is a natural environment where you\u2019re with lots of people, so you can do these skits or challenges.\u201d (A big part of TikTok culture, challenges are videos users create that riff on an of-the-moment meme.)", "description": "Teens love the app, and now it\u2019s getting the stamp of approval with teacher-approved clubs.
