A vet explains the pros and cons of this trendy diet", "language": "en", "text": "If you follow a low-carb diet, it\u2019s only natural to wonder if it\u2019s a good idea for your pet to do the same. After all, you feel good going grain-free... wouldn\u2019t your dog feel better too?\n\nNot necessarily, Lisa Lippman, DVM, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Grain-free dog food is a popular trend right now, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should actually do this.\n\n\u201cWhen people hear \u2018grain\u2019 they often think \u2018gluten,\u2019 but these two are not interchangeable,\u201d Lippman says. \u201cGluten is a general name for the proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley and rye.\u201d Gluten also plays an important role in many pet foods, she says. In pet food, gluten helps foods keep their shape and essentially glues them together, she explains.\n\nGrains aren\u2019t a problem for the vast majority of pets.\n\n\u201cGrains provide carbohydrates, which give your pet energy and supply fiber to promote digestion,\u201d Lippman says. \u201cGrains also include essential nutrients like protein and essential fatty acids.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s actually \u201cextremely rare\u201d for dogs to have a grain sensitivity, Lippman says, noting that grain allergies impact less than one percent of dogs. However, if you suspect that your pet has a food allergy or sensitivity, talk to your vet to try to figure out the source and come up with a treatment plan from there. Otherwise, there\u2019s really no need for grain-free dog food.\n\n\u201cUnless your pet has been diagnosed with a medical condition that requires a gluten- or grain-free diet, the choice to give them either is based solely on your preferences,\u201d Lippman says.", "description": "If you follow a low-carb diet, it\u2019s only natural to wonder if it\u2019s a good idea for your pet to do the same.
