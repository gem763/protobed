USA TODAY\n\nARLINGTON, Texas \u2013 Some raw numbers won\u2019t look that good when Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Mike Pettine is given a stat book on his way back to Wisconsin on Sunday night.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys rolled up 563 yards of total offense and averaged 8.3 yards per play. They rushed for 122 yards and averaged 5.8 yards per carry.\n\nBut it\u2019s an example of the sum being greater than the parts for his group in a 34-24 victory at AT&T Stadium, as they shut out the Cowboys in the first half and didn\u2019t allow a touchdown until the two-minute mark in the third quarter.\n\nAll-Pro running back Ezekiel Elliott and the Cowboys offensive line was a focus for Pettine\u2019s front seven, and he rushed just 12 times for 62 yards \u2013 and two carries and 21 yards came in the final 13 seconds of the first half.\n\nPettine said the issues with his group\u2019s run fits up until Sunday were about fundamental errors, and while his players first noted they had to watch the film to properly review their effort, it felt like they had tightened up some issues.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re taking a step in the right direction in that aspect,\u201d Packers defensive tackle Tyler Lancaster said. \u201cThere are definitely a lot of things we\u2019ve got to clean up. There\u2019s no perfect game. I know there were some runs that go through and a lot of explosive plays so there\u2019s definitely a lot we need to clean up. But going back to fundamentals I personally felt better with hands so I think we\u2019re moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Packers outside linebacker Za'Darius Smith discusses how he channeled a negative comment from Ray Lewis into motivation in their win over the Cowboys. Olivia Reiner, PackersNews\n\nWhat also helped on the front lines was an opportunistic secondary getting after the ball on the back end. After the Packers offense went three-and-out on the game\u2019s first possession, the Cowboys immediately went to the air to try and throw the Packers out their run-heavy front. Dak Prescott moved the ball 37 yards in three plays \u2013 but a Jaire Alexander intercepted a ball off the hands of Cowboys receiver Amari Cooper and his ensuing 37-yard return set the offense up for its first score.\n\nDallas drove to the Green Bay 34 on its next possession thanks to a 46-yard pass play, but Za\u2019Darius Smith beat Cowboys backup left tackle Cameron Fleming with a bull rush to sack Prescott and force a punt. The Packers responded with a scoring drive, and by the end of one quarter it was 14-0.\n\nSuddenly the game looked like the first three contests of the season for the Packers, where they played freely with a multiple-score lead.\n\n\u201cI told the guys this week that we need to just hold our gaps, set the edge and everything will happen,\u201d Za\u2019Darius Smith said. \u201cYou can probably see that in the third quarter and we got a chance to get after them on third down. We had a chance to have fun in the first half.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay Packers outside linebacker Za'Darius Smith (55) acknowledges fans during warm ups before an NFL football game against the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Oct. 6, 2019.

Of the six third down stops Green Bay made, two were sacks, one was a throwaway forced by pressure from Kyler Fackrell and Adrian Amos on a blitz and one was a throwaway forced by pressure from Za\u2019Darius Smith.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a credit to our offense,\u201d defensive lineman Dean Lowry said. \u201cYou put them in plus-2- points in the second half and that\u2019s not really who they are, a passing team like that. That was a good part of the game play was getting up on them to make them one-dimensional.\u201d\n\nThe Packers hit Prescott eight times, recorded four tackles for loss and three sacks \u2013 all by Za\u2019Darius Smith (two) and Preston Smith. The two were shutout last week against Philadelphia.\n\nDespite the playmaking from the front, Za\u2019Darius Smith, Kenny Clark and Rashan Gary were flagged for four combined penalties in the fourth quarter, too, which aided two Cowboys touchdown drives and a possession that led to an eventual missed field goal.\n\n\u201cI got ticked off and that\u2019s not me, I\u2019m not that type of player and I apologize to my fans and my teammates because that wasn\u2019t acceptable,\u201d said Za\u2019Darius Smith, who was penalized for illegal use of hands and unnecessary roughness.\n\nThe Packers, who lost safety Darnell Savage Jr. (knee) and linebacker B.J. Goodson (neck) for the game and saw Kevin King (knee) and Za\u2019Darius Smith (knee) miss snaps with injuries now have a week before hosting Detroit on Monday, Oct. 14.\n\n\u201cSomeone (former Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis) had said something about our defense and our leadership and that really hit home,\u201d Za\u2019Darius Smith said. \u201cAs you can see, we are going to keep doing what we have to do to help this team and this defense and we are going to keep doing it. We are going to enjoy this win and prepare for Monday night football.\u201d", "description": "The Packers' defense shut out the Cowboys in the first half and didn\u2019t allow a touchdown until the two-minute mark in the third quarter.", "authors": ["Jim Owczarski", "Published P.M.
