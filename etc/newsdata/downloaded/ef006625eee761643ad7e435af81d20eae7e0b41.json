Then her husband died suddenly and she faced the prospect of raising their toddler son on her own. Now she has yet another hurdle to cross . . .\n\nIncredibly, Esthea Moll (31) from Bethlehem has remained positive despite having suffered so much adversity.\n\nEsthea\u2019s two-year-old son, Wian, is scheduled to have open-heart surgery on 28 November, only a year after her husband, Harald (32), died of a heart condition during a Mighty Men conference in Fouriesburg.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy to cope with. You have to be mom and dad, but I\u2019m doing well,\u201d she says.\n\n\"I believe God gives me the strength to get up every day and be the best mom to my boy,\u201d the teacher explains. Wian has a 8-mm hole in one of his heart chambers. \u201cA paediatrician picked it up about a year ago, after my husband\u2019s death.\n\n\"We thought it would close up with time, but it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis is the third major setback Esthea has suffered.\n\nOn 7 November 2017 she and four of her colleagues were involved in a horror crash while on their way to the Retief Combined School in Kestell.\n\nA truck carrying a load of bricks smashed into the side of their vehicle. Coreen Monk (30) died in the accident and Esthea sustained two fractured neck vertebrae.\n\n\u201cI had surgery to my neck and my recovery process was long and challenging, but I was supported by my wonderful husband and family.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t pick up my son for four months and my husband had to do virtually everything for me.\u201d\n\nThe second blow came when Harald passed away suddenly on 13 April 2018. \u201cWhen I said goodbye to him I never realised it would be our last time.\n\n\"On 14 April I got the call that Harald had died.\n\n\u201cI was hysterical. I wanted to scream. How could this possibly be!? We\u2019d been married hardly two years and our son was just 11 months old. \u201d\n\nEsthea says her faith sustained her throughout her ordeal of the last few years. \u201cI felt angry, but later I would learn that God never puts anything in your path he knows you can\u2019t deal with.\n\n\u201cA week after that, Wian turned a year old \u2013 without his dad.\u201d\n\nEsthea struggles with the fact that her son too has a heart condition and is anxious about what the future holds for them.\n\n\u201cLuckily I have a wonderful relatives and friends who are there for us and, in spite of having been through a tough time, I know I couldn\u2019t have survive it all without God in my life.\u201d", "description": "This is the third major setback Esthea has suffered.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9385/2887016ef25f405d8f68ac599331dc39.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
