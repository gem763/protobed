Adam Schiff again on Monday, and acknowledged that impeachment made his job 'harder.'\n\n'He went out as though I wrote it. He defrauded the American people. He defrauded congress. He defrauded himself and his family,' Trump said, in just the latest attack on Schiff since his panel began a series of actions in an impeachment investigation.\n\n'I think Adam Schiff should be investigated for what he did. He took to the great chamber, Congress, and he made a speech,' Trump said at an event to mark the signing of a trade deal with Japan.\n\n'And his speech was a fraud. Everything he said was a fraud,' said the president. Schiff has said the words he said at a hearing was meant as a parody of a shakedown. Trump also went after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has gotten behind an impeachment inquiry.\n\nPresident Donald Trump tore into House Intelligence chair Rep. Adam Schiff once again on Monday\n\n'He met with the whistleblower. They never said that. They never talked about it,' Trump said, referencing reports a Schiff aide met with the whistle-blower who alleges Trump abused his office before filing his report.\n\n'She's as guilty as he is because she knew all of that,' Trump said of the Speaker.\n\n'She knew everything about it and she didn't do anything about it. And I'll tell you what, they should really be looked at very strongly, because what they did is unthinkable,' said Trump. 'What they did to this country is unthinkable.'\n\nTrump over the weekend suggested the pair of California lawmakers should be impeached, but that remedy is reserved for presidents and judges. Members of Congress must be booted by a super-majority of their own colleagues or resign to leave office.\n\nEven as he lashed out at his political opponents, Trump admitted impeachment was taking a toll. Axios has reported Trump has fretted impeachment will be seen as a stain on his record.\n\n'I think it makes it harder to do my job, but I do my job and I do it better than anybody's done it for the first two and a half years based on results,' the president said.\n\nTrump said Rep. Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be 'investigated'\n\nPelosi, seen here with Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, got behind the impeachment inquiry after a whistle-blower's complaint became known\n\nBut he also appeared to relish the fight. 'I sort of thrive on it. You know why? Because it's s so important we get to the bottom of it,' the president said, blasting what he called the 'Mueller scam' \u2013 the probe into Russian election interference.\n\nTrump spoke on a day when the House Oversight panel extended its probe, seeking documents from the Pentagon as well as the budget office as it probes any efforts to leverage millions in security funding to get the Ukrainian government to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n'I think he's having some kind of a breakdown, because he got up and made a speech that bore no relationship to what the conversation was,' Trump said of Schiff. The president's critics, including prominently lawyer George Conway \u2013 who is the husband of Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway \u2013 have accused the president of suffering from a mental disorder.\n\nSchiff was describing Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nHe said people wouldn't read a three or four page transcript of a conversation. 'They don't have access to it,' he said, although Trump ordered its public release.\n\n'The meaning was horrible and the whole thought was horrible,' Trump vented.\n\nTrump said Monday it was a 'very normal, nice conversation.'\n\nTrump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said he is preparing possible lawsuits targeting Schiff and other Trump critics.\n\nHe told Yahoo News the efforts 'deprive him of civil rights' and said lawmakers are engaged in a 'conspiracy to remove the president at all costs.'\n\nMembers of Congress are protected by the Constitution's 'speech and debate' clause.", "description": "President Donald Trump blasted the House Intelligence chair again during event for signing a trade deal with Japan, saying he has 'defrauded himself and his family.'", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/22/19415212-0-image-a-2_1570484330609.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
