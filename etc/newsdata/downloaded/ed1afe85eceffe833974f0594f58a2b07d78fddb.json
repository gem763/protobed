Bahamian security forces were organizing evacuations on a landing craft. Other boats, including yachts and other private craft, were also helping to evacuate people.\n\nAvery Parotti, a 19-year-old bartender, and partner Stephen Chidles, a 26-year-old gas station attendant had been waiting at the port since 1 a.m. During the hurricane, waves lifted a yacht that smashed against a cement wall, which in turn collapsed on their home and destroyed it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left here. There are no jobs,\u201d said Parotti, who hopes to start a new life in the United States, where she has relatives.\n\nSecurity Minister Marvin Dames said authorities were striving to reach everyone, but the crews can\u2019t just bulldoze their way through fallen trees and other rubble because there might be bodies not yet recovered.\n\n\u201cWe have been through this before, but not at this level of devastation,\u201d Dames said.\n\nHe expressed understanding for the complaints of people who are calling for help after having their lives shattered by Dorian, but he urged patience for efforts by authorities to get in humanitarian aid.\n\nThe search for victims and survivors went on nearly a week after Dorian slammed the Bahamas with 185 mph (295 kph) winds that obliterated countless homes.\n\nAn array of organizations, countries and companies, including the United Nations, the U.S. government, the British Royal Navy, American Airlines and Royal Caribbean, have mobilized to send in food, water, generators, roof tarps, diapers, flashlights and other supplies. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the U.S. aid agency has asked the Defense Department to provide heavy-lift cargo planes to fly in supplies.\n\nDames said the runway at the airport on Grand Bahama island had been cleared and was ready for flights. Authorities also said that all ports had been reopened on that island and Abaco, both of which were devastated by the Category 5 storm.\n\nOn Grand Bahama, a long line formed at a cruise ship that had docked to distribute food and water. Among those waiting was Wellisy Taylor, a housewife.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do as Bahamians, we have to band together. If your brother needs sugar, you\u2019re going to have to give him sugar. If you need cream, they\u2019ll have to give you cream,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I grew up. That\u2019s the Bahamas that I know.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Gerardo Carrillo in Freeport, Bahamas, and AP writer Danica Coto in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFor more of AP\u2019s coverage of Hurricane Dorian, go to: https://apnews.com/Hurricanes", "description": "Prime Minister Hubert Minnis called it an \"hour of darkness\" for the Bahamas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d73c39a3b00002a74d0c170.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
