Hong Kong could slowly disappear except for its veneer. Or quickly. \u201cIs [Beijing] prepared to kill Hong Kong?\u201d Ng asks. Young people here, \u201cwho have nowhere else to go,\u201d increasingly think they have nothing to lose. Some of them \u201ccarry their last wills in their pockets.\u201d\n\nThey know they are dealing, ultimately, with a regime that has swept at least a million Uighur Muslims into prisons and \u201creeducation\u201d concentration camps. China\u2019s national anthem celebrates \u201cmillions of hearts with one mind.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s protesters are defending a society comfortable with many different minds. And they rightly have turned their anger against so-called \u201csmart lampposts\u201d \u2014 those likely adorned with facial-recognition technologies that serve policies of social control.\n\nFour decades ago, after President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 visit to China and as Americans were beginning to travel there in significant numbers, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., tartly observed that too many returning Americans were more voluble about the absence of flies in modernizing China than about the absence of freedom. Now, however, thanks to the ongoing drama in Hong Kong\u2019s streets, it is possible to hope that the West has passed \u201cpeak China\u201d \u2014 the apogee of blinkered admiration for a nation in which approximately 19% of the human race is saddled with one of the world\u2019s most sinister regimes.", "description": "", "authors": ["George Will", "Sltrib.Com Opinion Commentary George-F-Will-Hong-Kong"], "top_image": ""}
