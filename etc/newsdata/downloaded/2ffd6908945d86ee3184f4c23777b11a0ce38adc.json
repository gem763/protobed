We knew that if we came off the pitch, we probably wouldn\u2019t be going back on and we were very clear, as a group at half-time, that if anything happened in the second half, we would discuss this with the referee and he was also clear that everyone was going off.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate claims England \u201cmade a bigger statement than any team has done in international football\u201d after invoking the Uefa protocols due to the sickening racial abuse suffered during the Euro 2020 qualifier away to Bulgaria.", "authors": ["Jason Burt", "Chief Football Correspondent", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213041044-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF9BD_fYQB0teZOF4IslN2TSn4mbJSlWY2OEDy_ToFOc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
