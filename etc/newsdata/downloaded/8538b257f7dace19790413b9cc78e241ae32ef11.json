For the first two years of the mayor\u2019s tenure, a political operative working for the union repeatedly emailed top administration officials to argue for a citywide restriction.\n\nResponses from City Hall were noncommittal at the time. And by the time the union official left his job in September of 2015, the policy remained on the union\u2019s wishlist.\n\nThree years later, the city had put a limited version of that initiative in place in several neighborhoods and had just approved the measure in manufacturing areas. At the time, even attorneys studying the issue for the union were skeptical that the de Blasio administration would back a citywide restriction without further prodding. The problem? Officials did not seem to have a plausible reason for doing so.\n\n\u201cThe city recently approved a zoning change that will require special permits for hotels in all manufacturing zoning districts,\u201d the lawyers wrote on Dec. 4, 2018, to the Hotel Trades Council, according to a memo obtained by POLITICO. \u201cThe city has stated, however, that it doubts there is a land-use rationale for a citywide special permit use requirement. What reasonable land-use rationales can be developed?\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the Hotel Trades Council endorsed de Blasio\u2019s long-shot bid for the White House this year \u2014 and then pumped enough money into his campaign coffers to account for 70 percent of his donors \u2014 that the mayor publicly backed the policy citywide and instructed his Department of City Planning to study it.\n\nThe union has lobbied for the change for more than a decade, arguing it would protect the city from a glut of hotel development and promote higher quality inns with better paid workers. It would, of course, also give the Hotel Trades Council leverage. Every development proposal would land on the floor of the City Council, where politicians often feel beholden to the politically powerful organization. (Speaker Corey Johnson won his leadership post with crucial support from the union.) In exchange for approving an application, lawmakers would likely demand that a project be staffed with HTC workers.\n\nWhether or not de Blasio privately supported the citywide policy, he never put it into practice \u2014 something that would have put him at odds with high-ranking officials in his administration, including former Deputy Mayor Alicia Glen and former Planning Chairman Carl Weisbrod. Instead, de Blasio has defended his recent backing of the rule as the obvious conclusion of having required hotel special permits in several individual rezonings, including East Midtown, along with industrial areas.\n\n\u201cThis is a policy that we have been moving for in stages,\" he told NY1 last month. \"And I think it\u2019s a very community-friendly policy.\u201d\n\nThe outcome thus far has been to bring hotel construction to a standstill. To date, nobody has filed a special permit application to build a hotel in the rezoned areas, according to a city official and a land use attorney who studies the matter. And that dearth of permits dates back to three neighborhood rezonings in which former Mayor Michael Bloomberg instituted the special permit policy, beginning in 2008.\n\nDe Blasio has argued that hotels have such a dramatic impact on a surrounding neighborhood that it requires more oversight. \u201cWhen a hotel comes in, you\u2019re talking about a lot more activity, vehicular traffic, folks staying in the hotel. It has an impact that\u2019s different than a residential building for example,\u201d he said during the August NY1 interview.\n\nBut he has supported arguably more consequential development without a public approval process, such as 90 new homeless shelters, the scuttled Amazon headquarters, private development on public housing land and, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, four high rises.\n\nThe only hotels that appear to consistently generate community opposition are those that are used to house homeless New Yorkers \u2014 and those have received exemptions from the special permit policy.\n\n\"In a city where everybody opposes everything, it's notable that hotels actually have not attracted a lot of NIMBYism lately,\" said Stephen Smith, a co-founder at investment and brokerage firm Quantierra. \"For an administration that has spoken out against NIMBYism, it seems a bit hypocritical to be contributing to it in a way that not even the NIMBYs are asking for.\"", "description": "\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he told WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer, who asked him about allegations of a quid pro quo.", "authors": ["Sally Goldenberg", "Joe Anuta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/11/4f/01385afc4fbab3a68eea761fe4de/de-blasio-8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
