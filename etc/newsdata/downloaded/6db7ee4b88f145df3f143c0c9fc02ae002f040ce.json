A new album is out next spring.\n\nBut it's not just about established artists and groups at the Baku Jazz Festival. There is also an international competition in various disciplines to promote young talents.\n\nThe jury president, Rauf Alyev, says it is not only about talent but also takes stamina and diligence to become a successful jazz musician.\n\n\"You have to understand who is a hard worker,\" he says, noting that some young musicians tend to coast on their talent without putting in the hard graft involved in establishing themselves as recognised artists.\"\n\nOne such group is the German MASAA \u2014 made up of Lebanese singer Rabih Lahoud, drummer-percussionist Demian Kappenstein, Marcus Rust on trumpet and guitarist Reentko Dirks.\n\nThey are based in based in Dresden and Lahoud writes the lyrics and sings in both Arabic and French, although he insists the words are not necessarily the most important part of his music.\n\n\"Well the Arab language plays a role in this band but not in a sense where it is centrally important \u2014 it's more about the sound of the words, that\u2019s why I play around with words to create an ambience.\"\n\nThen there is the French singer, pianist and composer Julie Erikssen, who brings together pop and French style of jazz and blues. Her album \"Out of Chaos\" was released last year.\n\n\"I was very attracted to the piano and to classical music when I was small, so I listen Romantic era music like Chopin and Liszt,\" she tells Euronews.\n\n\"I found my love of singing by looking through the jazz discs of my parents and I also sang in church, so I am interested in gospel, which is in my opinion the essence of song.\"", "description": "Audiences were amazed as musicians who had never met before improvised and jammed together during an eclectic celebration of music", "authors": ["Wolfgang Spindler"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/24/32/1000x563_cmsv2_e26882b3-7d7d-5048-8a15-4dc61cc0438a-4252432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
