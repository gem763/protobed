REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - One in three British automotive firms is cutting jobs as Brexit nears, up from one in eight just under a year ago, according to a survey conducted by a group representing the industry which risks being a big loser from Brexit.\n\nEighty percent of firms feared leaving the European Union would hurt their future prospects and nearly two-thirds said they would be unable to invest in their British operations, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) survey showed.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, every day \u2018no deal\u2019 remains a possibility is another day of lost investment, another day that makes it harder to recover investor confidence in the UK,\u201d SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said.\n\n\u201cAs yet, the damage is not irreversible. But we need a deal. A deal that, in the short term, enables a \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 transition for as long as it takes to negotiate and implement the future trading relationship.\u201d\n\nIn the longer term, the industry needed frictionless trade with the EU, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to take Britain out of the EU without an agreement on Oct. 31 if necessary, although lawmakers have passed legislation that they say will force him to seek a delay from Brussels.\n\nThe autos sector, Britain\u2019s biggest exporter of goods, is concerned that World Trade Organisation tariffs of 10% on vehicles alongside new customs checks and border delays could halt production if there is a disorderly Brexit.\n\nLast week, Nissan (7201.T), which runs Britain\u2019s biggest car factory, said such tariffs would make its business unsustainable in Europe.\n\nThe SMMT said its survey was based on responses from 158 member companies polled in September.", "description": "One in three British automotive firms is cutting jobs as Brexit nears, up from one in eight just under a year ago, according to a survey conducted by a group representing the industry which risks being a big loser from Brexit.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441023943&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E0FI", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
