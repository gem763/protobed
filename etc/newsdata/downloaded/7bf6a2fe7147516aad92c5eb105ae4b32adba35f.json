The 18-year-old student and 38-year-old woman face up to a year in prison if convicted.\n\nThe mask ban is part of a range of emergency powers which came into effect on Saturday, aimed at quashing violence in the protests for more democratic freedoms.\n\nProtesters wearing Guy Fawkes masks take part in an Anti-ERO (Emergency Regulations Ordinance) demonstration against a newly imposed law banning face masks in public in Hong Kong on Sunday\n\nBut instead of deterring rioting and calming the anti-Beijing demonstrations that have rocked the international financial hub for four months, it fuelled anger and spurred on radical protesters.\n\nDetained early Saturday shortly after the ban took effect, the pair were further charged with unlawful assembly, which carries a heavier penalty of up to five years in jail. A conviction under the mask ban is punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine. They were both released on bail pending trial.\n\nTens of thousands of masked protesters marched defiantly in the city centre Sunday, but the peaceful rallies quickly degenerated into chaos at several locations as hard-liners again lobbed gasoline bombs, started fires and trashed subway stations and China-linked banks and shops. Police responded with tear gas in familiar skirmishes.\n\nIt also drew a first warning from the Chinese military after protesters pointed lasers at one of its barracks in Hong Kong. Police said rioters also attacked bystanders, including two men left unconscious after bloody beatings and a woman who took photos of rioting.\n\nProtesters run for cover as tear gas fills the air in the Mong Kok district of the city on Monday\n\nAn anti-government protester throws back a tear gas canister during a demonstration in Wan Chai district on Sunday\n\nIn a statement Monday, police said the 'public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation.' The chaos has led many shops and public services to shutter and panic buying in some areas.\n\nThe city's MTR network of subways and trains was entirely closed Saturday and partially reopened Sunday but was quickly targeted again by protesters. Most stations remained closed Monday amid fears of more protests.\n\nHong Kong's High Court has rejected a second effort to invalidate the mask ban but agreed to hear later this month an application by 24 legislators against Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam's use of the colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance to impose the ban without legislative approval.\n\nLam has said that the mask ban will make the identification of rioters easier for police and that other measures are possible if violence continues.\n\nCritics fear Lam's use of the emergency law that gives her broad powers to implement any measures she deems necessary could pave the way for more draconian moves. The law was enacted by the British in 1922 to quell a seamen's strike and was last used in 1967 to crush riots.\n\nLam has said she will seek the legislature's backing for the mask ban when it meets next on October 16.\n\nA police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media said 13 people were detained Saturday for violating the ban and other offences but couldn't say how many more were arrested Sunday.\n\nProtesters sprint through the streets of the financial hub on Monday as tear gas fills the air\n\nA woman is treated after police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the Mong Kok district in Hong Kong on Monday\n\nEnforcement is tricky in a city where many have worn surgical masks since a deadly respiratory disease outbreak in 2003. Both peaceful and violent demonstrators say violence is the only way for protesters to force the government to bend to clamors for full democracy and other demands.\n\nBut it sparked fears of more deadly duels after two teens were injured by gunfire from officers under attack this week. An 18-year-old protester, shot at close range by a riot officer on Tuesday, was charged with rioting and assaulting police. A 14-year-old teen, who suffered a gunshot wound to his thigh Friday night, was arrested.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a proposed law that would have allowed some criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial, but have since morphed into a larger anti-government movement.\n\nProtesters are upset at what they say are Beijing's increasing influence over the former British colony, which was promised a level of autonomy when it was handed back to Chinese rule in 1997.", "description": "In a tutorial video spreading through the encrypted messaging app Telegram, a young woman from Hong Kong shows how tie a plait in a mask over her face with two holes for her eyes.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19398408-0-image-a-107_1570456695872.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
