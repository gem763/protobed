But it\u2019s the unbelievable plot twists that we watch them for\n\nAccording to the writer and broadcaster Mark Lawson, it\u2019s time for soaps to tone things down. The likes of Coronation Street and EastEnders are in crisis, he says in the latest issue of the Radio Times, because they are \u201c[piling] catastrophe after crisis on the best-known characters\u201d in order to boost flagging ratings. \u201cAs other TV fiction has become busier and darker, perhaps the soaps need to aim lighter and slower,\u201d he adds. But, really, what would the fun be in that? Here are the most outlandish, most memorable soap plots of all time.\n\n1. Neighbours\n\nHarold Bishop returns\n\nSurely a heart attack on the edge of a cliff would be enough to finish anyone off? However, drowning proved no biggie for Erinsborough\u2019s resident tuba fan, who was found five years later at a Salvation Army shop, having apparently been afflicted with amnesia and assumed the name Ted.\n\n2. Crossroads\n\nIt was all a dream\n\nThe first rule of writing \u2013 do not, under any circumstances, use the words \u201cIt was all a dream\u201d \u2013 was flagrantly flouted by Crossroads. The soap\u2019s early-00s revival, plagued by poor ratings, was explained away in its final episode as some kind of hallucination on the part of a supermarket worker, with the show\u2019s characters merely customers in the shop where she worked (yes, really).\n\n3. Emmerdale\n\nPlane crash wipes out the village\n\nThere have been few culls bigger than Emmerdale\u2019s fiery air disaster, which wiped out half of the cast and sent the formerly sleepy daytime soap into TV\u2019s big leagues.

Brookside\n\nBody under the patio\n\nWhen his wife, Mandy, could no longer stand his abuse, Trevor Jordache ended up six feet under in this infamous soap plot. However, an underground leak \u2013 and not, gladly, the weird stench of decomposing flesh \u2013 led to his discovery.\n\n5. EastEnders\n\nDirty Den returns\n\nLike Harold, Leslie Grantham\u2019s Den was presumed dead when he was caught up in some cut-price Krays business with \u201cthe Firm\u201d. But, 14 years later, it was revealed that, like many a Brit before him, he had faked his death and moved to Spain.\n\n6. Dallas\n\nDream season\n\nNot as bad as Crossroads yet still completely implausible, Dallas wrote off its entire 1985-86 season \u2013 including Bobby Ewing\u2019s highly unpopular death \u2013 by claiming it had all been the hyper-vivid dream of his wife, Pam.\n\n7. Dallas\n\nWho Shot JR?\n\nThe cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers, the shooting saga dragged on for eight months, via twists, turns and tie-in T-shirts. Around the world, 350 million people tuned in to find out the answer, which makes Line of Duty\u2019s viewing figures look paltry.\n\n8. Neighbours\n\nIt was all a dog\u2019s dream\n\nWhat\u2019s better (worse?) than \u201cit was all a dream\u201d? It was all a dog\u2019s dream, of course! Which is precisely what happened in Neighbours when pooch Bouncer enjoyed a totally normal romantic reverie.\n\n9. Days of Our Lives\n\nSalem stalker\n\nA killing spree rocked the US soap in 2000, culminating in the perpetrator, Marlena, choking her final victim with a doughnut. The dead characters were subsequently revived and marooned on an island. And then the killer was revealed to be someone else. Because why not?\n\n10. Coronation Street\n\nTricky Dicky\n\nSlippery finance guy Richard Hillman ingratiated himself with Gail Platt and family, subsequently kidnapping, gaslighting and killing his way across Weatherfield. He eventually drove the Platts into a canal in his people carrier, but \u2013 luckily \u2013 the only fatality was Tricky Dicky himself.\n\n11. Hollyoaks\n\nTwincest\n\nIncest. There\u2019s not really a good way to cover it. But if you\u2019ve got to do it, maybe having two characters have a one-night stand, completely forget one other and then find out that they are siblings \u2013 as tried out by Hollyoaks with Dodger and Sienna \u2013 is the most palatable option?\n\nZoe (Michelle Ryan) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) have it out. Photograph: You Tube\n\n12. EastEnders\n\nYou ain\u2019t my muvva\n\nThe storyline may be cliched, but it was the way in which Kat Slater revealed to sister Zoe that she was, in fact, her muvva that makes this such a classic. Less of a scream, more of an almighty, earth-shaking bellow, her words rang out so far that non-viewers could probably have heard them if they had opened a window.\n\n13. Dynasty\n\nWedding massacre\n\nAmanda and Prince Michael\u2019s wedding ended in bloodshed \u2013 mixed with Dynasty\u2019s trademark melodrama, the effect was almost stunningly gruesome. The show\u2019s producer Esther Shapiro later described it as \u201clike a Goya painting\u201d \u2013 the first and last time Dynasty would be described in such highbrow terms.\n\n14. Sunset Beach\n\nCursed jewels\n\nThe completely bonkers Sunset Beach aired for just two years, but managed to pack in more ridiculous plotlines than most do in 30. The jewel in the crown? Cursed gems that mummified their victims.\n\n15. Neighbours\n\nFake Dee\n\nDee Bliss did a Harold/Dirty Den disappearing act, only to reappear on Ramsay Street 14 years later. Or did she? It was, in fact, an impostor, Andrea, who would later come face to face with the real Dee, who was actually her twin sister.
