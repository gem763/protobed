Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nThe first billionaire I ever interviewed was Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce. It was the summer of 2011, and I was working on a profile of his surging interest in philanthropy, which had vaulted him into the uppermost ranks of the city\u2019s donors. Benioff declined to talk to me at first, but eventually he relented, and he had me over to his very nice house in San Francisco to talk about his journey from workaholic salesman at Oracle to public company CEO.\n\nOne thing I took away from the conversation was that Benioff, much more than the other CEOs I had spoken with up to that point, framed every discussion in terms of values. It was why, he said, he had set aside 1 percent of his company\u2019s shares to fund a philanthropic foundation, which exists to this day. It was why he gave all of his employees time off each year to volunteer. It was why he donated to causes including education, homelessness, and the city\u2019s children\u2019s hospital, to which he ultimately gave $100 million.\n\nI came away thinking that, whatever the ethics of being a billionaire (or relying on their whims to fund philanthropic efforts), on balance San Francisco was lucky to have a business leader who so regularly put his money where his values are.\n\nIn the years since, Benioff has become a prominent critic of social networks, which he has accused of acting irresponsibly. Last week, and not for the first time, he called Facebook \u201cthe new cigarettes,\u201d and called for Section 230 to be abolished. (As Alex Kantrowitz pointed out at the time, this would create a lot of problems for Salesforce\u2019s lawyers.)\n\nPossibly related to all this, Benioff has a new book out. It\u2019s called Trailblazer, and it presents a kind of have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too approach to business leadership in which doing the right thing is always hard, but always creates the most value in the end.\n\nI\u2019m not all that interested in entrepreneurial hustle porn, but I am interested in local billionaires who have a lot to say about social networks. (Facebook opinions aside, of course, Benioff also once tried and failed to acquire Twitter.) And Salesforce has also seen its share of the sort of employee activism that this year have roiled Google, Amazon, and Microsoft \u2014 in Salesforce\u2019s case, over its contract with Customs and Border Protection.\n\nAnd so, in the days before his book came out, I hopped on the phone for my first conversation with Benioff in almost a decade. A lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nCasey Newton: So the book opens with with you at Davos, telling your peers that you think it\u2019s time for regulators to come in and do what CEOs won\u2019t. And I wondered how you would rate the work that regulators have done since then, either in America or abroad?\n\nMarc Benioff: They\u2019re getting better. But it\u2019s still too little, too late. There is still a lack of understanding of what\u2019s happening with social media that works with data, and the lack of regulation that the companies need to be held accountable. Even in political advertising, they need to be held accountable to the trust and truth that all journalism is held accountable to, right? You know, government can\u2019t do it alone. It\u2019s about business and government.\n\nI also will say, some of the regulators that we work with have come a long way in the last 18 or 24 months. But it\u2019s got to go faster. And this is a moment in time when we need better ethics when it comes to what\u2019s happening on the internet. Tech companies can\u2019t wash their hands [of] what people are doing with their products, right? These companies have to take responsibility for their products, [which can] spread conspiracy theories, or place knowingly false advertising, or end up with journalists being jailed in different countries. And this is the key point of the book.\n\nYou take a rather dim view of the big social networks, Facebook in particular. But in the past, I\u2019ve also heard you talk about the value of the \u201csocial enterprise.\u201d And it seems like there was a time where you were really enthusiastic about what these networks could do for businesses and their customers. Was there a moment when your feelings about social networks and their responsibilities started to change?\n\nWell, I think that inside companies, social networks can create more transparency and trust. And in theory, public networks should also have that same transparency and trust. But because they\u2019ve been taken over by robots and by organizations that are trying to spread darkness and negativity and falsehoods, that\u2019s when it breaks down. That doesn\u2019t happen inside of a company, because employees will walk out if that happens.\n\nAnother social network that you feel strongly about in the book is Twitter. And you tell this amazing story about how the day you went to pitch the bankers on lending you the money to buy it, you tripped and cut your leg open, and and felt like maybe that was an omen, and abandoned the project completely. And between that and what we know about the history of this company, do you ever feel like Twitter is just cursed, Marc?\n\nBecause that\u2019s been my own feeling writing about it now for nine years.\n\nI use the product every day. And I think it\u2019s a product that still has tremendous potential. But their vision of what safety is, and trust and truth \u2014 still can be elevated at a higher level.\n\nReading your account of trying to buy it, I got the sense that you wish your folks had supported you a little bit more on that purchase. Do you wish you were running it today?\n\nWhen I look at that, I just say that was not meant to be. That I listened to all my stakeholders, and I walked away. There\u2019s a lot of people who have challenged me on that decision. But the reality is, I\u2019m running a public company. It\u2019s not my company. It\u2019s a company that I run in partnership with all of my stakeholders. And that\u2019s why I wrote the book Trailblazer, because that\u2019s how I think all companies should be run.\n\nThis is the first book you\u2019ve written since we started seeing these big waves of activity from tech workers over political issues. And you write about how difficult it was to navigate through your own employees\u2019 frustrations with Salesforce\u2019s CBP contract. What was it like for you to find a compromise there. And do tech workers have more leverage over CEOs than they used to?\n\nWell, as I said, these tech companies can\u2019t wash their hands of what people do with their products. I can\u2019t wash my hands of what people do with my product. We have responsibility for how our products are being used. That\u2019s why I created an Office of Ethical and Humane Use. But it\u2019s also why that Office of Ethical and Humane Use came to us in the last month or so and said, \u201cHey, we need to ban military assault weapons. We need to ban certain firearms. We have to ban military weapons. We can\u2019t have those sold in our commerce cloud.\u201d\n\nAnd, look, everyone\u2019s not going to agree with us all the time on what we\u2019re doing. But I will have a process and an ethical team who I think is making very good decisions.\n\nI\u2019ve been struck over the past few years, seeing these kinds of uprisings at so many tech companies \u2014 do you have a thought on why it is suddenly that the tech workers are getting a sense of their own power?\n\nI think they realized that we need a new capitalism \u2014 that capitalism as we know it is dead. That they have the ability to be part of the new capitalism, and that means that they can bring their values to work. That these values can create value for them and for the companies they work for. And that businesses have to move this new capitalism \u2014 a more fair and equal sustainable way of doing business, that values all stakeholders as well as shareholders. And one of those key stakeholders is the employees themselves.\n\nI write mostly about the big social networks. If the the CEOs of those networks were to take one thing away from this book, what would you want that to be?\n\nThat nothing is more important than the trust you have with your customers, employees, partners, shareholders, and all stakeholders. And trust has to be your highest value. People either trust you or they don\u2019t. Every person needs to ask the question: what is our highest value? And if trust isn\u2019t your highest value, then what is it? If your highest value is power and control, or money, or innovation or anything else, it\u2019s not correct.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending up: Facebook committed to spending $1 billion to address the housing crisis in California.
