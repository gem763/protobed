None of the deliveries were induced and none of the ladies were born via C-section, she added.\n\n\"Since Sabella was a baby, we starting teaching her that we are three generations with the same birthday,\" Chavez said. \"The day she was born and the doctors found out at the hospital they asked, 'Can we tell the news? Because [you're] 1-in-48-million.'\"\n\nJessica Chavez\n\nChavez said she, her mom and Sabella celebrate their birthdays together with cake, balloons and a visit from the local news.", "description": "Lourdes Pizarro (aka Nana) was born Oct. 2, 1959.
