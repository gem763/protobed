He had a presidential desk and a business desk. I don\u2019t think you people, with this phony Emoluments Clause,\u201d he said Monday, before trailing off to complain he\u2019s losing money by serving as president.\n\nThe emoluments clause is written in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney announced Thursday that Mr. Trump\u2019s Doral resort was \u201cfar and away\u201d the best place to hold the G7, despite knowing the administration would face accusations that the president was using the summit for personal gain.\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s Republican allies said it was difficult to defend the decision and that it came at a politically sensitive time for the president, who is fending off an impeachment inquiry and criticism over his Syria policy.\n\nMr. Mulvaney on Sunday said the president was eager to hold the G7 at Doral because he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business.\n\nMr. Trump confirmed that Monday saying \u201cI\u2019m very good at real estate\u201d and \u201ceveryone in the G-7 would have had their own building.\u201d\n\nHe also blasted former President Barack Obama, pointing to his post-presidency book deal and a streaming-television contract.\n\n\u201cHe has a deal with Netflix. When did they start talking about that?\u201d he said.\n\nThe debate over Mr. Trump\u2019s actions, however, centers on payments from U.S. taxpayers and foreign entities.\n\nInvestigations by press outlets have found foreign governments have poured money into his properties since he took office. Those sorts of moves had spawned lawsuits arguing the payments were emoluments.\n\nThe president has maintained ownership of his business empire since becoming president, though he has turned over day-to-day operations to his children.\n\nMr. Trump vowed during a January 2017 press conference to keep a firewall between himself and the family business, saying it was important to win the public\u2019s trust even if conflict-of-interest laws don\u2019t require presidents to divorce themselves from their assets.\n\n\u201cPresident-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests,\u201d Sheri Dillon, a D.C. attorney, said at the time. \u201cHe instructed us to take all steps realistically possible to make it clear that he is not exploiting the office of the presidency for his personal benefit.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Trump\u2019s weekend tweets appeared to acknowledge he was still pulling the strings at his business.\n\n\u201cI announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nCritics of the initial decision to hold the G7 at Doral said it put foreign leaders in an uncomfortable position and would amount to a free ad for his resort, even if the Trump Organization didn\u2019t bring in a profit.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I get enough promotion? I get more promotion than any human being that\u2019s ever lived, I think,\u201d Mr. Trump said after ticking off a list of great things about the resort.\n\nMr. Trump said the resort has big meeting rooms, great security and is close to the airport. \u201cIt would have been the greatest G7 ever,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
