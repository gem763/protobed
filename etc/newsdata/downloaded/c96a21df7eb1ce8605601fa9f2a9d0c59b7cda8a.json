But in particular for us, it's the balance between supply and demand.\"\n\n\"With regards to (Trump's) statement, we see that at the time of the statement the price goes up or down but after a while returns to where it was,\" he added in the exclusive interview.\n\n\"Therefore, in my view, these are not fundamental factors. Fundamental factors do not lie in words but actions.\"\n\nHis comments come shortly after the conclusion of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) in Abu Dhabi, with OPEC allies agreeing to ask over-producing members to bring production back in line with their targets.\n\nThe full coalition of OPEC and non-OPEC partners \u2014 sometimes referred to as \"OPEC+\" \u2014 will next meet in Vienna in early December to decide whether any further action to stabilize oil markets is required for 2020.\n\nThe group has struggled to shore up oil prices this year, amid booming U.S. production and a slowing global economy.\n\nIt has called into question whether OPEC+ really wields that much influence over oil markets.", "description": "Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has his focus on longer-term market factors rather than President Donald Trump's tweets, he said Thursday.", "authors": ["Natasha Turak Sam Meredith", "Natasha Turak", "Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106125998-1568291752719gettyimages-1166056628.jpeg?v=1568291839", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
