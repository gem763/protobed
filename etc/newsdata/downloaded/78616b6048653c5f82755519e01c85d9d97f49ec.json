The update dragged a sub-index of banks lower\n\nby 2.1%.\n\nFinancial companies have also had to adjust to a lower\n\ninterest rate environment this year as central banks globally\n\nmove to loosen monetary policies to cushion an impact from trade\n\ntensions.\n\nTo that end, markets are also keeping a close eye on the\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve's meeting this week for more support from\n\nthe world's biggest central bank to aid a slowing economy.\n\n\"The external factors that worry the Federal Reserve seem to\n\nbe abating currently and hence should have less impact on\n\nmonetary policy trajectory and policymaker's decisions,\" Hussein\n\nSayed, Chief market strategist at FXTM, said.\n\nIn addition, UK firms face a lack of clarity at home as\n\nlawmakers and Prime Minister Boris Johnson feud over how to get\n\nBrexit done.\n\nJohnson has demanded a general election after being forced\n\nto request for another delay to the departure date, and sources\n\nhave told Reuters that the European Union could agree to an\n\nextension until Jan.31 with an earlier departure also possible.\n\nNews-related moves were scarce among midcaps, but for a\n\n11.2% plunge in Cairn Energy after the oil and gas\n\nexplorer abandoned an offshore well in Mexico. The update put the stock on course for its steepest one-day\n\nfall in nearly three years.\n\nAston Martin , which has plunged nearly 80% from a\n\n2018 debut, dropped 7% with a trader pointing to rating\n\ndowngrade by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1-HSBC update sparks selloff in UK banks, drags FTSE 100 lower", "description": "UPDATE 1-HSBC update sparks selloff in UK banks, drags FTSE 100 lower", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_4_800x533_L_1413112066.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
