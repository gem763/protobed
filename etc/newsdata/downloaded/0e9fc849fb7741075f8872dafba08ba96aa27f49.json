Hinch said.\n\n\u201cWe know how quickly momentum can shift. We\u2019re not going to take anything for granted, but our confidence level is good.\u201d\n\nIt should be after three wins in Washington where the Nationals hit only .175 and scored just once in each game. But Washington defied the odds all season just to get this far after a 19-31 start to the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe guys feel good. They\u2019re all upbeat,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cThis is way far from over.\u201d\n\nThe Astros won an MLB-best 107 games in the regular season, then needed a one-game winner-take-all victory over Tampa Bay to advance and then bounced back from losing an American League final opener against the New York Yankees.\n\n\u201cResiliency,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThis is not a magic carpet ride of a season. We\u2019ve been successful. We had a lot of wins. But there\u2019s still been this sense of we have to keep proving it. And that\u2019s resiliency.\u201d\n\nAstros pitcher Gerrit Cole, the MLB season strikeout leader, used the same term to sum up the Astros\u2019 year.\n\n\u201cResiliency is a great word,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe just put one foot in front of the next, respond to the challenges that come our way, shower off the mistakes and celebrate the amazing plays.\u201d\n\nNot since the 1996 New York Yankees rallied to beat Atlanta has a club overcome losing the first two at home to capture the title.\n\n\u2013 Success into confidence \u2013\n\nHouston\u2019s 2017 World Series victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers has provided confidence the Astros can fight through any challenge.\n\n\u201cThe confidence comes from the success we\u2019ve had,\u201d Hinch said.\n\n\u201cAny experience pays off at this time. We\u2019ve been there, done that. I\u2019ve made big decisions in these type of games before. So there\u2019s a comfort and belief in myself and the process I have as a manager.\n\n\u201cWhen you do play the experience card is when you\u2019re under the most stress. And I would tell you game six and game seven in the World Series is high stress. This is where you lean on experience.\u201d\n\nFor Hinch, that has meant keeping his cool when falling behind 0-2 in a World Series where his club was a heavy favorite.\n\n\u201cWhen something doesn\u2019t go your way, there\u2019s an immediate overreaction. \u2018What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong with your team?\u2019\u201d Hinch said.\n\n\u201cAnd my message is always that we\u2019re the same team. We\u2019re the same talent. We have the same vibe. We have the same preparation. It\u2019s like you get defensive on your team when you get doubted.\u201d\n\nA players-only meeting helped the Astros regain their poise. Since then they\u2019ve outscored the Nationals 19-3.\n\n\u201cThe leadership in that room is impressive,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWe started to bring our personality back. We started to bring our run production back. We started playing from ahead. That was key for us. Nothing has really changed other than the pressure we\u2019ve been able to apply.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Injuries hit Nats hard \u2013\n\nThe Nationals lost star pitcher Max Scherzer to neck muscle spasms and his status remained uncertain for a possible game-seven start.\n\n\u201cThere won\u2019t be a game seven if we can\u2019t win a game six so our focus is winning and go from there,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nThe Nats figure to welcome back catcher Kurt Suzuki, who suffered a hip flexor injury in game four but hopes to play in Tuesday\u2019s must-win contest.\n\n\u201cPretty much everybody eliminated us from the season in May, so we\u2019ve kind of been playing like every game was an elimination game since then,\u201d Suzuki said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to go out and play. You can\u2019t worry about what\u2019s at stake.\u201d", "description": "Houston (AFP) \u2013 On the verge of a historic World Series fightback, the Houston Astros returned home Monday planning to lean on resilience and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/5640be_houston-astros-manager-cole-talking-pitcher-gerrit-cole-confidence-resilency-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
