After a year\u2019s wait to see a consultant, we were told that our son might have ADHD, but unless we wanted to give him drugs, we should get him into sport. It has taken four years since that consultant\u2019s dismissal, and countless hours of chasing people to get my son diagnosed.\n\nThis week, we finally saw the team at CAMHS and got his diagnosis of ADHD. All they can offer is medication and a suggestion to seek help from the charity MIND. Now we face another wait for his autism diagnosis to be confirmed from a different department.\n\nI don\u2019t know where to start when it comes to funding issues. Hours of my time have been wasted, and doctors and early help providers can offer little resources due to a lack of money. Parents and teachers are offered little help or support until diagnosis, then they have to figure out how to handle children who are clearly struggling.\n\nWhile we have been waiting for a diagnosis, my son was punished at school for his behaviour, causing his self-esteem to drop to an all-time low. He was punished for not being able to sit down in class, labelled a naughty child by several teachers and parents, and he has taken it badly.\n\nHelp from the hospital has been patchy, with people occasionally dispatched to check up on us. One lady watched my son for half an hour and concluded that he had attachment disorder caused by neglect as a child. Can you imagine hearing that as a dedicated parent? It is simply unforgiveable, untrue and has caused irreparable damage to my own mental health.\n\nThe EHCP (Education Health and Care Plan) is quite simply a description of what is required for that child to function, as well as an instruction manual for teachers in an educational setting. That is, if the children are able to access education. Without an EHCP, life is almost unbearable for these children and their families. Misunderstood and judged, they are bullied, excluded and dismissed.\n\nOur EHCP application was immediately rejected because my son\u2019s needs \u201caren\u2019t severe enough\u201d, and we were advised to appeal. This is the norm. If you are lucky enough to get through the appeals process at a tribunal, then awarded this EHCP \u201cgolden ticket\u201d, as it is sometimes described, your next fight is to ensure that school implements the EHCP plan \u2013 this frequently doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nDespite our long wait and our struggle, we are one of the lucky families. It has been stressful, but I have never backed down and instead I\u2019ve pushed to be heard.\n\nBy writing an article suggesting that SEN pupils are fleecing the neurotypical educational pot is discriminatory against those in dire need. It insinuates that often vulnerable children are viewed as inferior to those who have no additional needs.\n\nChildren with special needs are not sub humans. They are super humans, dealing with crippling anxiety daily in a world that neither understands them nor shows limited signs of wishing to do so. Our journey has not been plain sailing and neither will it be so in the future. I just hope the future will bring less suspicion and resentment from parents and people who are supposed to be on our side.", "description": "I saw the headline and felt sick. \u201cPupils lose out as \u00a3400m schools funding diverted to special needs.\u201d\u00a0 My 7-year-old son has a diagnosis of ADHD and needs additional support at school, and this type of article only serves to further the division between parents of children with additional needs and those without.
