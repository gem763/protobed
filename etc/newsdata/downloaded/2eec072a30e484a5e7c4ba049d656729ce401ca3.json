Both Singh and Mphushomadi were employed by the City at the time of the offence.\n\nThe Hawks and the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) investigated the matter after a tender was awarded to supply and maintain computers in the municipality.\n\nThe tender was issued to Meropa Sechabeng Technology CC, which had barely been in existence for 10 months. David was the sole director at the time.\n\nDuring the bidding process, David had declared that he had no relationship with people in the service of the state, or anyone who may be involved in the evaluation and adjudication of the bid.\n\nHowever, it later became known that David was related through marriage to Nilesh Singh, the Hawks said. Singh is said to have been instrumental in the awarding of the tender.\n\nMphushomadi, who is a member of Nanga Transport CC, was also involved in the specifications of the said tender. Shortly after the tender was awarded, Nanga purchased a number of Mercedes Benz trucks, which cost close to R4m, and paid for it with the money Meropa Sechaba received from the municipality, News24 reported.\n\nMeropa Sechaba also splashed out around R8m in cash from the tender on 16 luxury vehicles.", "description": "Sentencing proceedings in a corruption case involving two former City of Ekurhuleni officials have been delayed again, as one of the convicted men has not yet fully paid for a social worker report that will be used in mitigation of sentence.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7776/30aad8b37c964eaf9cbcf5a33e9800e3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
