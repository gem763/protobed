And I know who gave those orders, but I do not hate them either,\" he said.\n\nVyshynsky accused former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko of ordering his arrest to boost approval ratings. If the politician had not lost Kiev's presidential election in April, he would still be behind bars, he said.\n\nUkraine's SBU security services accused Vyshynsky of travelling to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014 to carry out \"subversive\" reporting and justify its annexation by Russia.\n\nKiev also accused him of having supported the Russia-backed separatists fighting against its forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nPutin granted Vyshynsky Russian citizenship by decree in 2015.\n\nSome 13,000 people have been killed in the conflict that broke out in eastern Ukraine shortly after Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. The international community refuses to recognise the annexation.", "description": "Kyrylo Vyshynsky, a Russian-Ukrainian journalist flown to Moscow as part of a landmark prisoner swap with Kiev, on Monday thanked President Vladimir Putin and said his case was politically motivated.
