Powell \u2014 whom he appointed \u2014 and pursuing a trade war that is hurting far more than it\u2019s helping. If nothing else, self-interest should motivate Trump to try; the president needs the economy to stay strong to have any hope of winning reelection next year. Despite that, he seems incapable of focusing his attention on a proactive agenda to ensure this outcome.\n\nHis inactivity has a historical parallel, one that should concern all Americans: Calvin Coolidge and the tumultuous, ultimately disastrous economy of the 1920s.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCoolidge became president in August 1923 when his predecessor, Warren Harding, died of a heart attack. The former Massachusetts governor quickly became known for his dry sense of humor and his staggering mediocrity, both of which made him massively popular \u2014 sound familiar? He wasn\u2019t even supposed to be vice president, having been selected by delegates at the Republican National Convention in Chicago as an act of rebellion against political bosses who preferred progressive Sen. Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin. Coolidge was thus, along with Gerald Ford several decades later, the most accidental of presidents.\n\nOnce in the White House, as political scientists Sidney Milkis and Michael Nelson have argued, \u201cCoolidge raised inactivity to an art.\u201d Strangely for a chief magistrate, he had an aversion to public policy and the legislative process. During his nearly six years in office, he championed only one measure: a tax bill that cut rates for the wealthiest Americans. Coolidge chose to reign, not rule.\n\nAnd yet, his gift for public relations allowed him to form a deep bond with the American people. He accomplished this by mastering the newest communications technology to arrive on the scene: radio. His initial State of the Union address was the first to be broadcast via that medium, as was his acceptance speech at the 1924 Republican convention in Cleveland.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the first time in U.S. history, more than just a small sliver of the electorate could hear the nation\u2019s leader address them directly. Coolidge, recognizing the political power of that connection, scheduled monthly radio broadcasts for the remainder of his tenure. At the same time that he was taking advantage of this revolutionary shift in telecommunications, he held frequent news conferences \u2014 520 during his time in office (a rate of nearly twice per week). This was something relatively new for a president, reaching out to the media as a conduit for frequent contact with the citizenry.\n\nCoolidge\u2019s outreach to the American people, however, hid the fact that he was shirking his presidential responsibilities. His focus on building his personal brand came at the expense of taking public policy seriously. This was troubling, given the warning signs that an economic disaster was looming. The stock market was overheating as the wealthy made increasingly risky investments, fueled by Coolidge\u2019s tax policies and his aversion to regulation. In the Midwest and South, he did nothing to address the sharp rise in economic hardship faced by farmers even as nearly 5,000 rural banks shut their doors. He ignored rampant real estate speculation in Florida and elsewhere despite its potential to destabilize the national economy.\n\nCoolidge chose to reign as the foundations of the financial system collapsed. Rather than run for a second full term, he left office just months before the crash and resulting depression shook democratic capitalism to its core. Unfortunately, his successor, Herbert Hoover, decided to follow the same path of nonintervention, thus ensuring that the economic disaster would last for more than a decade.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are actions these presidents might have taken to alleviate Americans\u2019 suffering and mitigate the damage of the crash. We know this because a very similar set of problems faced our leaders just over a decade ago, and they reacted quite differently. Although there is good reason to blame George W. Bush\u2019s policies, which in many ways mirrored those of Coolidge, for pushing the economy toward the brink, once it started going over the edge, Bush decided to rule. Rather than sit on the sidelines, he signed a $170 billion stimulus package and later championed a controversial bank bailout plan aimed at assisting distressed financial institutions.\n\nWhen he came into office, Barack Obama continued to rule by fighting for interventions that included developing a $787 billion stimulus plan, bailing out the auto industry, and authorizing $11.5 trillion in spending and loan guarantees by the Federal Reserve. By taking action, Bush and Obama staved off a much deeper depression, and stable economic growth returned in just 18 months.\n\nNow we are facing the prospect of another economic crisis. Yet unlike a decade ago, we have a president more interested in reigning than ruling. Trump\u2019s inaction seems more a product of indifference than of ideology. Like Coolidge, his focus is on shaping national opinion about his presidency using the latest revolutionary telecommunications technology: social media. While Coolidge held biweekly news conferences and delivered monthly radio addresses, Trump tweets more than 10 times per day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdd to this an obsession with manipulating cable television coverage, and the result is presidential self-promotion on steroids. Instead of gathering his economic advisers and working on an infrastructure plan, making targeted direct cash payments to citizens or strengthening the manufacturing sector by ending his ruinous trade war with China, each of which might help avoid a recession, he prefers trying to fool the American people into thinking he is taking action to make their lives better. The result could be economic calamity.\n\nIf Coolidge made inaction an art form, Trump has made it a cancer eating away at the foundations of democratic capitalism. Democrats may not have the power to force him to take action in the short term, but they must articulate a vision for how to fix our economic system and protect ordinary workers in the long term. If we are to prevent a Hoover-like second Trump term, this must be a centerpiece of the eventual Democratic nominee\u2019s pitch to the American people: a promise not to reign, but to govern.\n\nAD", "description": "Trump\u2019s inaction on the economy mimics Coolidge\u2019s inattention, which precipitated the Great Depression.", "authors": ["Thor Hogan", "Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/J12w_5IqutWha1qiKnUmMHUfNrY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DFWZ7NWTFUI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg"}
