It\u2019s been two weeks since a whistleblower report on Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, prompted Democrats to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. Trump could eventually be impeached for pressuring a foreign leader to investigate his political rival, though Bee could think of better reasons.\n\nShe pointed to Tuesday\u2019s report from the New York Times that Trump often privately discussed fortifying a border wall with an alligator and snake-stocked moat, \u201cprompting aides to seek a cost estimate\u201d.\n\n\u201cHe wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh,\u201d the report read. The New York Times also reported that Trump wanted soldiers to shoot migrants and, when informed that was illegal, suggested they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down.\n\nTrump\u2019s ideas left Bee aghast. \u201cWhat, and I cannot stress this enough, the fuck,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what is more disturbing: how elaborate the president\u2019s fantasies of murdering immigrants are or that he got the idea from Melania\u2019s new bedroom design.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel: for Trump, 'things that are true are false' Read more\n\n\u201cAt this point,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Trump\u2019s plan for separating migrant families wasn\u2019t limb by limb.\u201d\n\nBee zoomed in on a particularly baffling detail: that aides sought a cost estimate for a border moat of snakes and alligators. \u201cHow did those calls go?\u201d she wondered, riffing: \u201cHello, zoo. How much to rent your hungriest alligators and poisoniest snakes? No don\u2019t hang up, I\u2019m calling from the White House!\u201d\n\nStill, the moat report was one of the \u201cleast insane things\u201d to happen this week, Bee said, referencing the barrage of impeachment inquiry headlines. \u201cThe news is breaking so quickly we can\u2019t keep up with it.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really scary is not just what Trump did,\u201d Bee said of this news cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s how far other Republicans are willing to go for him.\u201d For example, Bill Barr, the attorney general, has reportedly solicited the leaders of Italy and Australia to help investigate the origins of the Mueller investigation. That idea of a scandal behind Mueller \u201cis a fantasy,\u201d Bee emphasized, \u201cbut Barr is using the power of the US government to try to make it true.\u201d\n\nBarr is supposed to be an adult in the room, Bee concluded, but is rolling over for Trump. \u201cYou are supposed to tell this psychopath child NO,\u201d she said, \u201cnot try to arm-twist other countries into making his 4chan wet dream a reality.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert: \u2018That\u2019s the way your presidency crumbles\u2019\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is clearly losing it, and he did not have a surplus of \u2018it\u2019 to start with,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on The Late Show, referring to the president\u2019s increasingly dramatic attacks on the impeachment inquiry. On Wednesday, the president tweeted that the inquiry was a \u201cCOUP intended to take away \u2026 their Freedoms, their Second Amendment, Religion, Military, Border Wall, and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does he mean take away your guns and religion?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cDoes he not know that if Trump is removed office, Mike Pence becomes president?\u201d\n\nTrump \u201ccontinued to froth\u201d in a joint appearance with the president of Finland on Wednesday, where he insisted that \u201cthe only thing that matters\u201d is the White House-released transcript of his call with Zelenskiy. \u201cYes, all that matters is the transcript \u2013 the transcript where the president of Ukraine asked for missiles and you say \u2018I would like you to do us a favor, though,\u2019\u201d Colbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a Scooby-Doo villain saying \u2018I would\u2019ve gotten away with it too if it wasn\u2019t for me releasing this signed confession.\u2019\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi, meanwhile, continued to approve subpoenas for the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry, \u201chanding them out like cookies\u201d, according to Trump. \u201cYes, they are like cookies,\u201d Colbert responded, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the way your presidency crumbles.\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah: \u2018The most xenophobic Dr Seuss book ever\u2019\n\nThe Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) Trump takes his rage towards impeachment proceedings and immigrants to an 11. pic.twitter.com/wcKv6gGOh7\n\n\u201cThe past few weeks clearly haven\u2019t been Trump\u2019s favorite,\u201d said Trevor Noah on The Daily Show. \u201cImpeachment is consuming his life. His poll numbers are dipping again.\u201d And on top of that, the New York Times report on his cruel ideas for a border wall have ignited another firestorm of condemnation.\n\nTo recap, according to the Times, Trump suggested to aides that a border wall be fortified by a moat stocked with snakes and alligators, \u201cwhich I know sounds crazy,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbut to be fair, it\u2019s been very effective at keeping him out of Melania\u2019s bedroom\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably where he got the idea,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean it\u2019s either that or his top immigration adviser is an actual reptile.\u201d\n\nSome people might hear this news and think the president is joking about the animals, said Noah, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u201d. The idea was real enough that his aides sought a cost estimate. \u201cThey actually got a quote for the moat,\u201d Noah mused, \u201cwhich also sounds like the name of the most xenophobic Dr Seuss book ever.\u201d", "description": "Late-night hosts discussed Trump\u2019s increasingly strange responses to the impeachment inquiry and his plans for a border moat", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03ee651e44b6e4eb6c3ce662277dd67679d69da7/206_12_1363_818/master/1363.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96b112024cb900e1fe16b3e0548bb2ff"}
