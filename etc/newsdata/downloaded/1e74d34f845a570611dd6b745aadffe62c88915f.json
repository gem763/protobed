Those that enable it can also turn it off later in settings. The company also specifies that Siri data is not associated with a user's Apple ID.\n\nINSTAGRAM REMOVES FICTIONAL DEPICTIONS OF SELF-HARM, SUICIDE\n\nRATS CAN DRIVE SMALL CARS TO EASE THEIR ANXIETY, RESEARCHERS CLAIM\n\nPrivacy experts and advocates have pushed back against the practice of audio review by human beings, saying it raises the possibility that the details of sensitive conversations could be leaked.\n\nOther tech firms have also been resuming the practice after giving more notice. Google restarted the practice in September, after taking similar steps to make sure people know what they are agreeing to. In September, Amazon said users of its Alexa digital assistant could request that recordings of their voice commands delete automatically.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Apple has resumed the controversial practice of allowing humans to review Siri commands and dictation with the latest iPhone software update.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/02/getty-images-siri-apple.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
