(Tyrone Siu/Reuters)\n\nThe \u201cyellow object\u201d lying on the ground had a distinct shape, evident in the footage that surfaced later. Certainly, a good portion of the object was bright yellow. It appeared to have arms. And two protrusions that resembled legs. Someone had dressed the object in dark-colored shorts.\n\nAs Hong Kong police officers swarmed over the object and roughed it up in a dark alley, the object appeared to squirm.\n\nIn a city now accustomed to clashes between demonstrators and police as the government responds to months of protests with tear gas and mass arrests, the incident on Saturday and the official response illustrated a breakdown in the relationship between the police force and the public.\n\nA high definition, in focus video showing the malpractice by the police, shot by Yuen Long resident Ben, obtained for @HKFrontline - Acting Senior SP (Ops)(NTN HQ) Vasco Williams, that is not an \u2018yellow object\u2019 #antiELAB #ExtraditionLaw #HongKongProtests pic.twitter.com/X7RH9QwiZX \u2014 Galileo Cheng (@galileocheng) September 23, 2019\n\nThe episode underlined a harsh reality in this global financial hub, once admired for its legal system and official transparency. With Beijing flexing increasing control of the city\u2019s institutions, and Hong Kong\u2019s leader refusing to allow an independent inquiry into police behavior, the city\u2019s authorities appear not to fear the consequences of violating protocols intended to uphold the rule of law.\n\nInstead, their approach this week was to obfuscate.\n\nAsked Monday about the incident in Yuen Long, an outlying area of Hong Kong, acting senior superintendent Vasco Williams said footage showed an \u201cofficer kicking a yellow object,\u201d not a man lying on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what that object is, but there are other videos that are more clear that show the entire incident. And there\u2019s no malpractice by the police whatsoever,\u201d he said. There was no assault, he added during a heated news conference.\n\nThe man shown in the video being kicked by police was a member of a group that deploys volunteers to negotiate between police and protesters at rallies, the group said. He was later arrested, local media reported.\n\n\n\nRiot police stand guard behind a burning barricade as they disperse anti-government protesters after a march in Tuen Mun, Hong Kong, on Saturday. (Tyrone Siu/Reuters)\n\nWilliams conceded that the case warranted investigation but suggested that the video could have been \u201cdoctored.\u201d This was quickly debunked.\n\n\u201cKnowing you are being videoed, do you think any officer would be that stupid to assault someone under detention? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Williams said. Hong Kong\u2019s daily police briefings are carried by numerous news outlets and watched by thousands. Nearly as soon as Williams spoke, netizens pointed out that over a month ago, two officers were arrested after being captured on security footage beating a 62-year-old man they had restrained to a hospital bed.\n\nShortly after the news conference ended, posts that appeared to be from Williams\u2019s account on the job-networking site LinkedIn were revealed, drawing even more negative attention to the police from those supportive of the pro-democracy movement.\n\n[Hong Kong protests threaten to rain on China\u2019s anniversary parade]\n\nThe account, which used the name Vasco W. and listed \u201cSuperintendent at the Hong Kong Police Force\u201d as the job description, made a number of derogatory comments about protesters, pro-democracy lawmakers and Hong Kong residents in recent months. Images of the posts were taken by The Washington Post before the account appeared to be deactivated.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s police force said it would not comment on individual cases. But it added that the force attaches \u201cgreat importance to the behavior of police officers on the use of social media\u201d and noted that it had issued guidelines on social-media usage seven years ago.\n\nThroughout the protests that have rocked the city, triggered by a now-shelved plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam has refused to countenance an independent investigation into police tactics \u2014 one of protesters\u2019 five demands.\n\nThose tactics have become more forceful over recent weeks, with police making more than 1,550 arrests and deploying water cannons and stinging blue dye along with tear gas.\n\nA report last week by Amnesty International accused the force of \u201creckless and indiscriminate\u201d tactics, including torture, beatings and mistreatment of protesters in police detention. The report followed criticism of the police by the United Nations.\n\nAsked Tuesday how her government could rebuild trust in the police without a fully independent investigation, Lam said her support for the force does not mean she \u201ccondones irregularities.\u201d The existing police watchdog has Lam\u2019s \u201cfull support\u201d to do fact-finding studies, but critics have noted that it is headed by an official handpicked by Lam, is stuffed with her associates and loyalists, and has no ability to call witnesses.\n\n[Hong Kong protesters target Beijing-friendly businesses in latest demonstrations]\n\nPressed about the video of the \u201cyellow object,\u201d Lam said it would be difficult to opine on \u201cwhat is right, what is wrong, what is true, what is fake, because there have been . . . different versions [of] the same incident.\u201d\n\nThe police have been under extreme pressure, she said, adding it was \u201cquite remarkable\u201d that there had been no fatalities.\n\nThe violence has not been one-way. Hardcore protesters have intensified their tactics, such as pelting officers with molotov cocktails and bricks, and setting up burning barricades to stymie police operations. Others have used slingshots to launch rocks at police and have pestered officers with laser pointers. Police said over the weekend that a protester tried to steal an officer\u2019s revolver.\n\nThe protests represent a challenge to the authority of Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who warned in 2017 that any effort to contest China\u2019s sovereignty over Hong Kong was a \u201cred line.\u201d Although not an independence movement, the protests have come as Xi faces pressure on numerous fronts, from China\u2019s trade dispute with the United States to a slowing economy, rising food prices, a recalcitrant Taiwanese administration, and accusations of cultural genocide against the Uighur people in China\u2019s Xinjiang region.\n\n[China\u2019s clampdown on Muslims creeps into the heartland, finds new targets]\n\nChinese authorities are particularly anxious ahead of Oct. 1, when the Communist Party plans to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Protesters are planning to disrupt official events in Hong Kong, where the government has already canceled a fireworks show.\n\nOn Tuesday in Hong Kong, a pro-democracy lawmaker, Roy Kwong, was attacked by three masked men as he tried to get into his car. The trio kicked and punched Kwong and recorded the attack on video, according to other lawmakers from the democracy camp.\n\n\u201cThe fact the attackers recorded the ambush leads me to believe that the attackers were possibly paid to do this and the video would be needed as proof in order to get paid,\u201d said James To, a pro-democracy lawmaker. \u201cBy beating him, it is sending quite an alarming signal that Hong Kong is a place without regard for rule of law.\u201d\n\nTiffany Liang contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t breathe\u2019: Hong Kong protesters allege beatings and torture by city\u2019s police\n\nHong Kong protests threaten to rain on China\u2019s anniversary parade\n\nHong Kong protesters target Beijing-friendly businesses in latest demonstrations\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The official response to an incident in which officers kicked a man on the ground shows a breakdown of trust between people and the government.", "authors": ["David Crawshaw", "Asian Politics", "Geopolitics", "Especially North", "South Korea", "Southeast Asia", "Australia", "Timothy Mclaughlin", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KbJQ19C9AqRv25NIELvIsV9QMY4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SH5OR6G6UQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
