(Alex Brandon)\n\nThe Washington Nationals are without their best catcher and might be for a while longer. Kurt Suzuki hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 7, because right elbow inflammation has prevented him from throwing. The 35-year-old hit in the batting cage \u201ca little bit\u201d Friday and felt \u201cokay,\u201d Manager Dave Martinez said Saturday morning. Not long before, Suzuki put on his gear, marched to the bullpen and squatted to simulate catching so that, when he can throw, he\u2019ll return as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cWe miss him,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe hope we can get him back soon, but he\u2019s doing everything he can to try to get ready to play again as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nIf Suzuki feels good, the Nationals hope to have him hit on the field early next week, and Martinez added, \u201cWe\u2019ll go from there.\u201d The Nationals, meanwhile, have leaned on Suzuki\u2019s platoon-mate, Yan Gomes, who had started seven games in a row. They finally gave him a rest Saturday, when they started a catcher not named Gomes or Suzuki for the first time this season. Raudy Read has spent the year at Class AAA Fresno and is familiar with starter Austin Voth from their time together there.\n\n[Nationals come home, but offense appears to have missed flight back to D.C.]\n\nThe Nationals know Read can hit; his .863 on-base-plus-slugging percentage this season stood out even in the offense-friendly Pacific Coast League. But they need the 25-year-old to show he can call games at the major league level \u2014 one of Suzuki\u2019s biggest strengths. Martinez on Friday spoke with Read\u2019s manager in Fresno, Randy Knorr, and later sat Read down for a chat. The manager explained the most important thing he wanted to see was to \u201ccontrol the pitcher.\u201d The Nationals need Read to be prepared, throw down the correct fingers and captain the ship. Martinez thought Read\u2019s approach and familiarity from Fresno would translate to the big leagues.\n\n\u201cHe knows Voth. He knows how he works, so I\u2019m really anxious to watch him go out there and catch,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry so much about hitting \u2014 though I hope he hits the ball out of the ballpark because he\u2019s got tremendous power. Just do your job catching.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals understand this is not a feasible long-term fix. They need Suzuki to return and, as has been the case all season with almost every player, they\u2019re playing it cautious. They plan to listen to both the medical staff and Suzuki about how his elbow feels. The goal is to get rid of the inflammation.\n\n\u201cOnce we do that, then we\u2019ll see how far we can push him to get him ready,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut a lot\u2019s going to determine on him and what he feels and how he feels.\u201d\n\nBraves (92-57)\n\nRonald Acu\u00f1a Jr., CF\n\nOzzie Albies, 2B\n\nFreddie Freeman, 1B\n\nJosh Donaldson, 3B\n\nNick Markakis, LF\n\nMatt Joyce, RF\n\nBrian McCann, C\n\nDansby Swanson, SS\n\nMike Foltynewicz, RHP\n\nNationals (81-65)\n\nTrea Turner, SS\n\nAdam Eaton, RF\n\nAnthony Rendon, 3B\n\nJuan Soto, LF\n\nAsdr\u00fabal Cabrera, 2B\n\nRyan Zimmerman, 1B\n\nVictor Robles, CF\n\nRaudy Read, C\n\nAustin Voth, RHP\n\nRead more on the Nationals:\n\nAs the Nationals enter the MLB wild-card stretch run, the stakes are higher than imagined\n\nFor some Marines, intramural softball championship at Nationals Park is \u2018like a dream come true\u2019\n\nThe Braves aren\u2019t surprising anyone this season.
