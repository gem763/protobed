Bernie Sanders. That\u2019s according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls as of Tuesday.\n\nWarren, however, has momentum, said Capital Alpha Partners analysts in a note. The Massachusetts senator seems to be gaining in perceived electability and even in estimates of how many convention delegates may support her, they said. Capital Alpha\u2019s team also stresses that Warren presents \u201ca particular threat\u201d to the financial sector XLF, +0.36% , noting she\u2019s a former head of a bailout oversight panel, a bankruptcy expert and a member of the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan for a wealth tax may be in the spotlight at Thursday\u2019s debate, which is slated to air from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Eastern Time on Walt Disney Co.\u2019s DIS, -2.19% ABC network. Proposals to ban fracking from Warren and other Democratic contenders also could get attention, given the debate is happening in Texas, home to many oil and gas companies XOP, +0.90% .\n\nRead more: How Warren\u2019s wealth tax could hit the fortunes of Bezos, Gates and Buffett\n\nAnd see: Democrats\u2019 fracking ban would hurt U.S. economy, says IEA chief\n\nTougher qualification requirements winnowed the number of participants in Thursday\u2019s debate to just 10 candidates, after 20 appeared over two nights in both the June debate in Miami and the July debate in Detroit. For this month\u2019s event, contenders had to hit 2% in at least four approved polls and attract 130,000 donors.\n\nThe 10 Democrats who have qualified are Biden, Warren, Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., as well as New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Housing and Urban Development chief Juli\u00e1n Castro, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. The October debate may end up being a two-night event again, as it\u2019s set to have at least 11 participants after billionaire Tom Steyer qualified for it.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s who America\u2019s CEOs are backing in the Democratic presidential race\n\nAnd read: 20 Democrats are running for president, after more exits from the race", "description": "Top-tier candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren are set to share a 2020 debate stage for the first time, leading pundits to brace for them to clash on...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR038_warren_ZG_20190910161639.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
