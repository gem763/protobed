Last weekend, security researchers pointed out that NordVPN\u2019s private keys, used to digitally sign the authenticity of a website, were leaked on the internet.\n\nTroublingly, a hacker could have engineered this exploit to stage a man-in-the-middle attack to route VPN users\u2019 traffic through a malicious fake server. What\u2019s more, the attack could have potentially captured users\u2019 unencrypted data exchanged with non-HTTPS websites.\n\nIn response, the panama-based company said a few months ago it became aware that one of its rented servers in Finland was accessed without authorization in March 2018.\n\nAdditionally, the company said the server was vulnerable between January 31, 2018 and March 20, 2018, but noted it was only breached once, during March.\n\nThe hacker leveraged an unprotected remote management system \u2013 left exposed by the unnamed data center \u2013 to access the server. The key, the company said, was stolen at the same time this data center was breached.\n\nNordVPN added the Finnish server did not contain activity logs, usernames, or passwords. But the attacker would have been able to see what websites users were visiting during that time, although the content of the websites themselves would be gated behind encryption barriers.\n\nSo apparently NordVPN was compromised at some point. Their (expired) private keys have been leaked, meaning anyone can just set up a server with those keys\u2026 pic.twitter.com/TOap6NyvNy \u2014 undefined (@hexdefined) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cWe did not disclose the exploit immediately because we had to make sure that none of our infrastructure could be prone to similar issues,\u201d the company said, adding it couldn\u2019t complete the security audit quickly because of its complex technical infrastructure and the huge number of servers involved.\n\nVPNs are an increasingly popular means to circumvent online censorship. They add an additional layer of anonymity by routing web traffic through an encrypted tunnel of remote proxy servers that keeps it safe from prying eyes.\n\nUsing a VPN, however, will not keep your browsing habits anonymous as the VPN provider would still be able to see which sites you are visiting, even if your internet service provider cannot. This is why it\u2019s important that a VPN provider has strong security controls and a zero-log policy, which NordVPN claims it strictly adheres to.\n\nSupply chain attacks on the rise\n\nThe security incidents are indicative of a key threat that exploits insecurities in the digital supply chain to mount a variety of attacks on businesses and critical infrastructure.\n\nExploiting a third-party also vastly increases the scale of an attack, as a successful break-in opens up access to multiple businesses, making them all vulnerable at once.\n\nIf anything, the sustained attacks against security apps underscores the need for carefully choosing a \u201cno-logging VPN operator who isn\u2019t out to sell or read your web traffic\u201d before entrusting them with virtually all your browsing data.\n\nRead next: Trump's ignorance couldn\u2019t kill Bitcoin in Q3 \u2014 here\u2019s what happened", "description": "Antivirus solution provider Avast and VPN service NordVPN each disclosed a data breach that were traced back to a case of exposed credentials.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fvpn-protection-hed.png&signature=f21181b35b75d796e77e9f893870dc06", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
