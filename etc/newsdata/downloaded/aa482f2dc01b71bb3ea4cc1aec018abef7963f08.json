They did, however, find plenty of eel DNA.\n\nBut that theory, too, raises questions. Eels usually only grow to 4 to 6 feet and they migrate to reproduce.\n\n\u201cPlenty of uncertainty remains,\u201d said Gemmell. Historically, sturgeon have been seen in Loch Ness, and seals often make their way into the lake. It could simply be the case that neither of those species were there at the time of the survey.\n\n(MORE: Scientists search for proof of Loch Ness monster)\n\nPHOTO: Clouds cover the sky above Loch Ness in Drumnadrochit, Scotland, on Sept. 5, 2019.

As much as Twitter users liked the video -- with friendly speculation about what the video shows, and even Prof. Gemmell weighing in -- the Ness Fishery Board may have been trolling their audience.\n\n\u201cThe footage is of a large 'eel shaped object' - it is actually likely to be a tree branch about three meters in length,\u201d Chris Conroy the director of the Ness Fisheries Board told ABC News. \u201cEels are common in the Ness system, but unlikely to reach that size.\u201d\n\nFor an eel, 4 to 5 feet would already be very long, and the object in the video is much longer.\n\n\"If you look at the original post, it was a bit tongue in cheek,\" said Conroy, it was a slow day on the camera, and they hadn't seen much wildlife. \"When you work on Loch Ness you're always thinking of the monster,\" he added.\n\nConroy couldn't believe how the video has traveled around the world, and how seriously people took it.\n\n\"It\u2019s very surprising, we just made a reference to the Loch Ness monster and its amazing how seriously people take [the video]. People have dissected it!\" He added that many people had written about giant eel, but very few had been in touch with Ness Fishery Board to find out the truth of the video.", "description": "A video of a \u201clarge, eel shaped object\u201d has people speculating that the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster really has been solved.
