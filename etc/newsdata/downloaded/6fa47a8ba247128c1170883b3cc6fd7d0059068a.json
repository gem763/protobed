Her access to power is righteously over,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAD\n\nNielsen served as President Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary from December 2017 through April 2019, and is most known for executing and subsequently defending the president\u2019s policy of separating migrant families.\n\nAccording to Fortune Live Media\u2019s website, Nielsen is scheduled to be interviewed by \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d anchor Amna Nawaz about \u201cthe horror of family separation, border security, and more\u201d in a panel titled \u201cThe Hard Questions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nActivist groups have had their eye on Nielsen in the aftermath of her actions as homeland security secretary. One such organization, Credo Action, led a widespread social media campaign last month to pressure the Atlantic to drop Nielsen from its annual festival, at which she had been invited to speak. Nielsen ultimately announced she would not participate in the event.\n\nFortune, on the other hand, has defended the former secretary\u2019s involvement in the summit.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the most powerful women in business, who also happen to be some of the most powerful women in the world, have strong views about how the U.S. Administration has handled its immigration policy,\u201d Fortune spokeswoman Alison Klooster said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe sought out an opportunity to bring the woman who was effectively responsible for that [immigration] policy to ask her tough questions publicly and on stage about that policy,\u201d she said. \u201cWe brought in Amna Nawaz from PBS NewsHour to do the interview with the clear understanding that this would be a no-holds-barred interview, and that there would be an opportunity for our MPW [Most Powerful Women] members to ask questions, as well. That\u2019s how we practice live journalism.\u201d\n\nFortune\u2019s decision to defend its decision comes despite other invitees pulling out of the conference in recent days. Award-winning filmmaker and author Dream Hampton announced last week that she would not attend the event because Nielsen was featured. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton also recently opted out of the event, though she cited scheduling conflicts, not Nielsen\u2019s presence, as her reason for withdrawing.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article reported that Credo Action held a protest outside Nielsen\u2019s home, during which they played a tape of detained children crying, after she was invited to speak at the Atlantic Festival in September. That protest occurred in 2018. The story has been updated.\n\nAD", "description": "The singer announced she will not participate in Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women conference after learning the former homeland security secretary was a speaker.", "authors": ["Nina Zafar", "Reporter", "Editorial Aide For Reliable Source"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yXr2WsQ1LqCCl1VDAyoaXSS_-70=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JBZNJBHGNII6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
