Is it right the United States is prosecuting its Australian founder, Julian Assange?\u201d asked Brett Mason, a correspondent for Australia\u2019s SBS News.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, that\u2019s a question I haven\u2019t heard in a long time. I\u2019ll leave that to you to determine,\u201d Mr. Trump replied.\n\nMr. Trump referenced WikiLeaks more than 100 times while campaigning for the White House in 2016, regularly lauding the website for publishing stolen material damaging to his opponent in the race, former Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\nMr. Assange was anything but rewarded by the Trump administration after Mr. Trump took office, however. He was arrested in London at the request of U.S. authorities in April and subsequently charged by the Department of Justice with 18 criminal counts related to WikiLeaks publishing other sensitive material several years earlier.\n\nHe remains jailed pending the results of an extradition hearing set to start in February 2020, and he faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life imprisoned if sent to the U.S. and convicted.\n\n\u201cI know nothing about WikiLeaks. It\u2019s not my thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said shortly following Mr. Assange\u2019s arrest. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing what\u2019s happened with Assange and that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who\u2019s doing an excellent job. So, he\u2019ll be making a determination. I know nothing really about him.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks had no immediate comment to the president\u2019s latest remarks.\n\nMr. Assange, 48, was born in Townsville, Queensland, Australia. He sought asylum inside the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 and lived there for roughly seven years prior to being punted in April and promptly arrested.\n\nJennifer Robinson, Mr. Assange\u2019s longtime attorney, previously urged both Mr. Morrison and his foreign minister, Marise Payne, to raise concerns about the prosecution during a meeting with a visiting U.S. delegation last month.\n\nMr. Morrison did not mention Mr. Assange while taking questions from reporters, and his office did not immediately return a message requesting comment.\n\nThe Justice Department has charged Mr. Assange in connection with soliciting and publishing classified U.S. military and diplomatic documents. He has argued he acted as a journalist and is fighting extradition.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
