Another hearing to set final bail terms was scheduled for Sept. 4, as government lawyers said they needed more time to assess Levandowski\u2019s finances.\n\nLevandowski surrendered his U.S. and French passports and will wear and ankle bracelet to monitor his whereabouts. A prosecutor expressed concern at the arraignment that Levandowski might be a flight risk.\n\nThe defendant, who wore a blue sport jacket and black jeans as his plea was entered, could face up to 10 years in prison on each count if convicted.\n\nLevandowski\u2019s prosecution is one of Silicon Valley\u2019s highest-profile trade secret theft cases, as engineers race to develop technology for self-driving vehicles, which industry experts view as a $1 trillion market opportunity within three decades.\n\nProsecutors accused Levandowski of stealing materials in late 2015 and early 2016 related to Waymo\u2019s self-driving car technology.\n\nThey said he did this after deciding to leave and form his own self-driving company, Ottomotto, which Uber later bought.\n\nThe alleged stolen materials included details related to Lidar, a crucial sensor technology, according to the indictment.\n\nAll people are free to change jobs, U.S. Attorney David Anderson said at a news conference. \u201cBut what we cannot do is stuff our pockets on the way out the door.\u201d\n\nAnderson declined to answer a reporter\u2019s question on whether Uber could also face any criminal charges. An Uber spokesman said the company had cooperated with the government throughout its investigation and would continue to do so.\n\nLevandowski left Waymo in early 2016 and eventually took over Uber\u2019s self-driving car project before being fired.\n\nFormer Google and Uber engineer Anthony Levandowski leaves the federal court after his arraignment hearing in San Jose, California, U.S. August 27, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n\u201cFor more than a decade, Anthony Levandowski has been an industry-leading innovator in self-driving technologies,\u201d and the government\u2019s case is a \u201crehash\u201d of discredited claims, his lawyer Miles Ehrlich told reporters at the courthouse.\n\nLawyers for Levandowski said the downloads in question occurred while their client was still working at Waymo, and that he was authorized to use the information.\n\nPronto, a self-driving software company that Levandowski co-founded in 2018, said in a statement it replaced him as chief executive with Robbie Miller, who had been chief safety officer. It also said it was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of Levandowski and his family.\n\nLegal battles involving Levandowski have cost Uber precious time on its self-driving car project, seen as important to its long-term profitability.\n\nLevandowski did not testify at the trial between Waymo and Uber before they settled, and has not spoken publicly about it.\n\nThe lawsuit was another public controversy for Uber, which was trying to emerge from scandals under former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, including over how it treated female employees.\n\nKalanick had called self-driving cars an \u201cexistential\u201d threat for the ride-hailing company.\n\nProsecutors said there remain legal limits to competition.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley is not the Wild West,\u201d FBI special agent in charge John Bennett said at a news conference. \u201cThe fast pace and competitive environment does not mean federal laws don\u2019t apply or they can be ignored.\u201d\n\nWaymo said it appreciated prosecutors\u2019 work on the case. \u201cWe have always believed competition should be fueled by innovation,\u201d a spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nAlphabet shares closed down 36 cents at $1,170.82, while Uber fell 20 cents to $33.11.", "description": "Anthony Levandowski, a pioneer in self-driving car technology, was criminally charged on Tuesday with stealing trade secrets from his former employer Google before joining rival Uber Technologies Inc .", "authors": ["Alexandria Sage", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190828&t=2&i=1423465968&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF7R037"}
