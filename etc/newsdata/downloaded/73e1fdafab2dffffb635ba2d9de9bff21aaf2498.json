Davidson in Seattle. \"They don't help banks. It might help the governments of the issuing countries.\"\n\nFed officials, looking at the experience of their overseas colleagues, remain highly skeptical.\n\nThe following charts show how the negative rates experiment has played out in the five economies that have tried them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPE\n\nThe ECB introduced negative rates in 2014 in the face of chronic disinflation and low growth. It is expected to cut its benchmark rate deeper into negative territory on Thursday.\n\nSo far, it has not provided a lasting boost to either prices or output.\n\n(GRAPHIC: ECB negative rates on the euro zone economy - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5995/5929/ECB%20negative%20rates,%20results.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nJAPAN\n\nThe BOJ embarked on its own journey into negative rates in 2016, with even less to show for the effort than the ECB.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Bank of Japan negative interest rates on the Japanese economy - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5998/5932/BOJ%20negative%20rates,%20results.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nSWEDEN\n\nSweden's Riksbank turned to sub-zero rates in 2015, and for a while it appeared to be working. Growth picked up and inflation accelerated.\n\n\"If their currencies depreciate, you can get a bigger benefit. Sweden has gone there. It's been more helpful to them,\" said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank in New York.\n\nBut those benefits now seem to be diminishing, Slok noted.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Riksbank's negative rates on the Swedish economy - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6000/5934/Riksbank%20negative%20rates,%20results.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nSWITZERLAND\n\nThe Swiss National Bank has pushed rates deeper into negative territory than any other central bank.\n\nThe resulting devaluation of the Swiss franc appeared to provide a tailwind for an export-oriented economy. Again, though, the lift has not lasted.\n\n(GRAPHIC: SNB negative rates on Swiss economy - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/5999/5933/SNB%20negative%20rates,%20results.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nDENMARK\n\nThe Danish central bank was early off the mark with negative rates, launching below-zero certificates of deposit in 2012. Growth accelerated for a time but inflation has remained weak nonetheless.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Denmark central bank's negative rates on the Danish economy - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/12/6002/5936/Denmark%20central%20bank's%20negative%20rates,%20results.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Dan Burns and Dan Grebler)", "description": "By setting interest rates below zero, policy-makers penalize banks for leaving excess cash with their central banks in the hope that it will spur lending and in turn boost business investment and consumer borrowing and spending.
