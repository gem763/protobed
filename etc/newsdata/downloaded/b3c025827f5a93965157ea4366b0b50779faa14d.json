(Image: R.B. Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, and David Curiel, Marvel Comics)\n\nMoira MacTaggert has been one of the longstanding support characters of the X-Men for decades, but House and Powers of X and this bold new age of X-Men storytelling at Marvel have transformed her into one of the most fundamentally vital characters in the mutant universe right now. Which means it\u2019s great news that we\u2019re getting a solo series all about her x-ploits.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not been following what Jonathan Hickman has been doing with the X-Men in House and Powers \u2014 a) stop reading this blog immediately because I\u2019m about to spoil something incredibly cool, and b) what on earth are you doing they\u2019re great go read them \u2014 then you might be a little confused as to why the longtime human ally of the X-Men, who\u2019s mostly been dead in recent continuity, suddenly matters so much. Well, long story short...\n\nMoira MacTaggert isn\u2019t a human. She\u2019s a mutant. And yes, she\u2019s been dead, but she\u2019s actually been dead several times over, because Moira\u2019s mutant ability is the power to, upon death, return to her birth with all her memories and knowledge of the life she lived \u2014 at this point, lives she lived \u2014 intact.\n\nIf You Like Comics, You Should Read Marvel's House Of X And Powers Of X For the past 11 weeks, I have eagerly awaited Wednesday mornings in a way I haven\u2019t in a very long time. I\u2019m a longtime comic book reader, and since Wednesdays are when new comics come out, I\u2019m always a little excited \u2014 but this has been different. There\u2019s something special going on in the world of X-Men comics, and I need to tell you about it. Read more\n\nIt\u2019s extremely cool because Hickman has used it to essentially interweave all of the prior X-Men continuity into a singular existence that makes it actually matter to the current story being told with these characters.\n\nHe\u2019s also used it to make Moira something of a mutant kingmaker, using her current life cycle \u2014 her 10th, leading to her going by the pseudonym Moira X, you see what they did there \u2014 to break all the rules of everything she has tried before to guide mutantkind to a future that does not end with their tragic extinction, reforging Charles Xavier and Magneto into figures who can lead a united sovereign nation of all mutantkind against the direst threats they could ever face.\n\nMoira is ready to break all the rules \u2014 and Charles Xavier \u2014 in her tenth life.

Silva, Pepe Larraz, Marte Gracia, David Curiel, and Clayton Cowles, Marvel Comics)\n\nSo now you kind of see why it\u2019s fascinating news that she\u2019s getting her own comic series, yes?\n\nHickman himself confirmed the news as part of a reader Q&A session with Adventures in Poor Taste today. Although he offered little in the way of really tangible details about the book, he did acknowledge it would not be one of the series in what is currently being referred to as the \u201cDawn of X\u201d lineup that he himself will actually write. In fact, a change was made to last week\u2019s Powers of X #6, the final issue of the House/Powers duology, because the unnamed writer Hickman and Marvel had hoped to take on a Moira book actually accepted the offer\n\n\u201cSo, yes, there was going to be a thousand-year timeline in the back of Powers of X #6 explaining all the cool things that happened in [Moira\u2019s ninth life]... the reason why this changed in production is because there was a writer we had hoped to get to do our eventual Moira book (that works as a kind of \u2018dancing between the raindrops\u2019 of X-Continuity story), and they agreed to do it long before we were expecting them to commit. Which was great news,\u201d Hickman told the site.\n\n\u201cThen I basically told them what I was planning to do and asked if they wanted me to NOT put the timeline in the book (which would lock a lot of plot/story stuff in), and after talking about it, we decided not to stick it in there. But we got the writer we wanted, and that book is going to be amazing.\u201d\n\nDescribing the Moira series as a way for this new age of X-Men comes to \u201cdance between the raindrops\u201d of the X-Men\u2019s long and convoluted continuity is fascinating. Especially as, like we said \u2014 not only does all of that stuff carry dramatic weight now that it is viewed through the lens of the many lives of Moira MacTaggert, it\u2019s a way to really, really dive deep into the nitty-gritty of X-Men lore. History, present, days of futures past and futures yet to come: it\u2019s all on the table for exploration through Moira\u2019s many eyes.\n\nSuffice to say, like Hickman, we too are very excited. X-cited, even. We\u2019ll bring you more on the currently unannounced Moira series as and when we learn it.", "description": "Moira MacTaggert has been one of the longstanding support characters of the X-Men for decades, but House and Powers of X and this bold new age of X-Men storytelling at Marvel have transformed her into one of the most fundamentally vital characters in the mutant universe right now.
