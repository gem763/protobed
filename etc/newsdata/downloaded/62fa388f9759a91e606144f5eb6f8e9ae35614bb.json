Investors are often drawn to strong companies with the idea of reinvesting the dividends. On the other hand, investors have been known to buy a stock because of its yield, and then lose money if the company's dividend doesn't live up to expectations.\n\nWith a nine-year payment history and a 5.7% yield, many investors probably find Dixons Carphone intriguing. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Dixons Carphone for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nLSE:DC. Historical Dividend Yield, October 8th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Although it reported a loss over the past 12 months, Dixons Carphone currently pays a dividend. When a company is loss-making, we next need to check to see if its cash flows can support the dividend.\n\nDixons Carphone paid out 97% of its free cash flow last year, which we think is concerning if cash flows do not improve.\n\nIs Dixons Carphone's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nGiven Dixons Carphone is paying a dividend but reported a loss over the past year, we need to check its balance sheet for signs of financial distress. A quick check of its financial situation can be done with two ratios: net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA measures total debt load relative to company earnings (lower = less debt), while net interest cover measures the ability to pay interest on the debt (higher = greater ability to pay interest costs). With net debt of 0.50 times its EBITDA, Dixons Carphone has an acceptable level of debt.\n\nNet interest cover can be calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by the company's net interest expense. Net interest cover of 7.94 times its interest expense appears reasonable for Dixons Carphone, although we're conscious that even high interest cover doesn't make a company bulletproof.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Dixons Carphone's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. The first recorded dividend for Dixons Carphone, in the last decade, was nine years ago. Although it has been paying a dividend for several years now, the dividend has been cut at least once by more than 20%, and we're cautious about the consistency of its dividend across a full economic cycle. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was UK\u00a30.045 in 2010, compared to UK\u00a30.068 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 4.6% a year over that time. Dixons Carphone's dividend payments have fluctuated, so it hasn't grown 4.6% every year, but the CAGR is a useful rule of thumb for approximating the historical growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Could Dixons Carphone plc (LON:DC.) be an attractive dividend share to own for the long haul?
