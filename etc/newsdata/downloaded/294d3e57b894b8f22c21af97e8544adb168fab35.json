That is down only slightly from 2 percent pace in the second quarter and a 3.1 percent pace in the first quarter.\n\nEconomists had expected growth to slow by even more, to an annualized rate of 1.6 percent.\n\nInflation-adjusted consumer spending rose 2.9 percent, above the forecast for 2.6 percent. That\u2019s all the more remarkable because the second quarter recorded 4.6 percent growth in consumer spending. Such back-to-back strength is unusual. Durable goods spending grew at a 7.6 percent rate on the back of last quarter\u2019s 13 percent growth rate.\n\nResidential investment rose at a 5.1 percent annual rate, making housing a significant contributor to economic growth in the quarter. Spending on vehicles was strong as was recreational spending, which along with housing is a sign of robust consumer confidence.\n\nBusiness investment was weak. Nonresidential fixed investment, inventories, and equipment were all drags on growth for the quarter.\n\nInflation was muted, with the GDP price personal consumption price expenditure index rising at a 1.7 percent rate, below the 2.4 percent rate in the second quarter. So-called \u201ccore\u201d inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was up 2.2 percent.", "description": "GDP grew at a faster pace than expected in the third quarter thanks to robust consumer spending and a stronger housing market.| Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/labor-day-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
