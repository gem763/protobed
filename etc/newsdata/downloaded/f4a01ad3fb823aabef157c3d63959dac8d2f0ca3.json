Ramos Miranda\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile braced for more protests and a general strike by state workers on Wednesday, despite President Sebastian Pinera\u2019s pleas for forgiveness and announcement of ambitious reforms to quell unrest that has rocked the country and led to at least 15 deaths.\n\nWorkers at Chile\u2019s state-owned Codelco, the world\u2019s largest copper producer, said late on Tuesday they would join the general strike called by state unions, raising the spectre of a slow-down in copper output from the world\u2019s top producer.\n\nDespite the announcement, Codelco\u2019s Chuquicamata mine was operating normally early on Wednesday, according to internal documents viewed by Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe strike will go on!\u201d the Central Worker\u2019s Trade Union (CUT) said on social media, calling on its workers to begin gathering mid-morning in the country\u2019s cities for a peaceful \u201ccaserolazo\u201d, in which protesters bang pots in solidarity.\n\nMany student groups, heathcare workers, and teachers also planned to join the protests, leaving the majority of the country\u2019s schools closed and many public services hobbled.\n\n\u201cWe invite all to join...what we want is peace, but the only durable peace comes with social justice,\u201d said CUT president Barbara Figueroa.\n\nPinera late on Tuesday said he hoped to turn recent violent protests, which have also seen some 5,000 people arrested, into an \u201copportunity\u201d for Chile.\n\nThe reforms include a guaranteed minimum wage, a hike in the state pension and the stabilization of electricity costs.\n\nThe president said the package represented \u201cconcrete and urgent steps\u201d to resolve inequality that has sent tens of thousands into the streets to demand an economic overhaul and, in some cases, his removal.\n\nDemonstrators march as they protest against high living costs continue, in Concepcion, Chile October 22, 2019.

Daniel Nunez, of Chile\u2019s Communist party, which did not take part in talks with Pinera\u2019s administration, said the president\u2019s proposals were insufficient.\n\n\u201cPinera\u2019s announcements are cosmetic, they won\u2019t end the social protests,\u201d Nunez said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nThe president\u2019s pledges came after the centre-right Pinera, a billionaire businessman, was widely criticized for saying on Monday that Chile was \u201cat war\u201d with violent protesters, even as thousands of people held peaceful demonstrations demanding an end to low wages and a high cost of living.\n\nAt least 15 people have died in protests that started over a hike in public transport costs, prompting a weekend of riots, arson attacks and looting of businesses and the declaration of a state of emergency by Pinera over a large swath of Chile.\n\nPope Francis, originally from neighbouring Argentina, said he was concerned over the protests in Chile at a general audience in St. Peter\u2019s Square Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI hope that by ending the violent demonstrations, through dialogue, efforts are made to find solutions to the crisis,\u201d Francis said.\n\nThe 69-year-old Pinera asked for forgiveness for successive governments of both left and right that failed to act sooner to stem deep inequalities in Latin America\u00b4s fifth-largest economy.\n\nSlideshow (12 Images)\n\nViviana Ramos, a worker at a local health care centre in Santiago, said she hoped for more from Pinera but understood there was a long road ahead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if people will have the patience to keep waiting,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cBut I understand these changes can\u2019t all come at once.\u201d", "description": "Chile braced for more protests and a general strike by state workers on Wednesday, despite President Sebastian Pinera's pleas for forgiveness and announcement of ambitious reforms to quell unrest that has rocked the country and led to at least 15 deaths.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443969190&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M06F", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
