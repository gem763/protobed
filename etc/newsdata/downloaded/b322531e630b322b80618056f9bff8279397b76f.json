The England head coach is trying to streamline his squad ahead of the Olympics next year, but it cannot have escaped his attention that 21-year-old Kelly added her fourth goal in six games.\n\nOn this evidence, it feels inconceivable that September\u2019s player of the month will not add a first start to her only England cap, won as a substitute against Austria last \u00adNovember, against Germany or the Czech \u00adRepublic next month.\n\nOn Sunday in Southport she opened the scoring just before the hour, rising from a flurry of fizzing interchanges between a front three comprising her, Simone Magill and Hannah Cain to twist and turn \u00adinside the area and scoop her shot into the far corner. Until the beginning of this campaign, Kelly had not featured since January because of injury and has only recently set about making up for lost time.\n\nAfter Kelly\u2019s opener, Everton dominated, and it was little surprise when Esme Morgan headed in a corner won when Inessa Kaagman\u2019s volley was tipped over the bar. It secured Everton\u2019s third league win of the season. Cain could have had one of her own had Megan Walsh not swooped to divert her effort on to the bar.", "description": "Everton 2 Brighton 0", "authors": ["Katie Whyatt", "Women'S Football Reporter", "Chris Bascombe", "Keith Hackett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/27/TELEMMGLPICT000214307750-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqk1vQnXPB3IwW2HOV72333fj2qukE9H700hF5QspDRNo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
