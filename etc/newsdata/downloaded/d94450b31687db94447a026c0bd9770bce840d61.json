Biden, while ignoring a story about Mr. Biden essentially blackmailing Ukrainian leaders to lay off his son.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, want to stay as far away as possible from the Joe Biden demand that the Ukrainian Government fire a prosecutor who was investigating his son, or they won\u2019t get a very large amount of U.S. money, so they fabricate a story about me and a perfectly fine and routine conversation I had with the new President of the Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a tweet.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa, Mr. Biden angrily accused the president Saturday of \u201cusing every element of his presidency to try and smear me.\u201d He called for an investigation into Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cYou should be asking him the question: Why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader?\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cThis appears to be an overwhelming abuse of power. The House should investigate. To get on the phone with a foreign leader who is looking for help from the United States and ask about me and imply things \u2026 this is outrageous. You have never seen anything like this from any president.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden angrily jabbed his finger at a reporter who asked if he had ever spoken to his son about his foreign business dealings, and said he hadn\u2019t.\n\nA government whistleblower has accused Mr. Trump of making an inappropriate promise to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky during a phone call in late July. The complaint reportedly alleges that Mr. Trump urged Mr. Zelensky to work with his attorney Rudy Giuliani to investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s post with an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch while his father was serving as vice president.\n\nAt the time, the U.S. was considering withholding $250 million in military aid for Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump said Saturday his conversations with the Ukrainian leader were proper.\n\n\u201cNothing was said that was in any way wrong, but Biden\u2019s demand, on the other hand, was a complete and total disaster. The Fake News knows this but doesn\u2019t want to report!\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2015, then-Vice President Biden told Ukrainian leaders that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in aid unless they fired the country\u2019s top prosecutor. That prosecutor had inherited an investigation of Hunter Biden\u2019s connections to the energy company, although Mr. Biden and other Obama administration officials said they wanted the prosecutor ousted for ignoring corruption.\n\nMr. Trump called the new development the \u201cUkraine Witch Hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that the Democrats and the Fake News Media have gone \u2018bust\u2019 on every other of their Witch Hunt schemes, they are trying to start one just as ridiculous as the others, call it the Ukraine Witch Hunt, while at the same time trying to protect Sleepy Joe Biden. Will fail again!\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nHouse Democrats are demanding a copy of an inspector general\u2019s report which details the whistleblower\u2019s complaint and determined the issue was \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nJoe Biden called on the president Friday to release a transcript of his phone call with the Ukrainian leader.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein of California, top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on Attorney General William P. Barr Friday to give Congress the whistleblower report and any guidance provided to the Director of National Intelligence, who is refusing to turn over the report to lawmakers.\n\n\u201cIf media reports are correct that President Trump delayed military aid appropriated by Congress in order to get Ukraine to investigate a political opponent, it\u2019s difficult not to see that as an abuse of presidential authority, plain and simple,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWithholding the whistleblower report that led to these allegations is also unacceptable. Covering this up will only make matters worse for this administration. I encourage them to clear this up as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
