It is not at the statistics that show how merciless MND is: that a third of sufferers will die within a year, half within two; that the last drug to treat the condition was approved in 1995 and increases life expectancy by only a couple of months. It is not at the injustice that he has reason to learn these facts at 30 \u2013 a reluctant expert on a disease affecting 5,000 in the UK. It is not even at the research this week which found that former professional footballers are four times more likely to die of MND.\n\nRather, his voice breaks when he raises his head and catches, in the front row, the gaze of his wife, the England captain Steph Houghton \u2013 \u201ca special girl, and for her to keep going the way she does is inspirational\u201d \u2013 his parents and, to his right, Chris Rimmer, the family friend and former British military veteran with whom Stephen has founded the Darby-Rimmer MND Foundation to increase awareness, support fellow sufferers and generate funds for research. To date, they have raised close to \u00a3400,000.\u200b\n\n\u201cIt affects us physically but mentally, almost, it\u2019s as hard, if not harder, for them [family] to go through,\u201d says Darby later. \u201cThey want to help, to see you better. I am sure sometimes they feel helpless but that\u2019s far from the truth. You ask the doctors what can be done to help or to stay as healthy as possible and you don\u2019t really get any answers. You\u2019re left on your own. The support from the professionals just isn\u2019t there. But Rimmer was there for me from day one.\u201d\u200b\n\nIt was in early 2017 when Darby, then at Bradford, experienced \u201csubtle\u201d symptoms: a weakness in his right hand and twitching in his muscles. A trip to the physio yielded a flurry of chest scans, shoulder scans, back scans, brain scans, electromyography tests, nerve conduction studies, lumbar punctures. \u201cThere were three or four things they were looking at. MND was mentioned but the likelihood that I had it was very slim, with me being so young, so fit and healthy. They didn\u2019t really think it would be that. There\u2019s no definitive test for MND. They will test for everything else and try to eliminate everything else. When they don\u2019t find anything, you\u2019re diagnosed with MND.\u201d\u200b\n\nThat process took 18 months. \u201cTo live with that, to have that hanging in the back of your mind \u2026 It is really tough,\u201d he explains. \u201cEarly on, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything like MND. You never think that will happen to you, but it does.\u201d \u200b", "description": "There are three moments when the former Liverpool and Bradford City defender Stephen Darby cries while reading a speech at the launch of the charity he set up after being diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease last summer.", "authors": ["Katie Whyatt", "Women'S Football Reporter", "Alan Tyers", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000203778739-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqoey2YVs_BaoIFEAZjihhdq70UtqZbEj4bXFQizYiEn8.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
