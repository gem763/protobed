She lost her husband when her daughter was still in primary school, and as a single mother, her priorities were providing for her family. Then at the age of 60, when she finally had a little more leisure time, she decided to take up a hobby. She went along to a workshop to make Japanese craft balls called temari. And it was love at first sight.\n\n\n\nTe (hand) and mari (ball) originated in China, and arrived in Japan around the 7th Century AD. They were made with scraps of kimono silk wrapped in other fabrics, and were given to children to use as a toy. During the Edo period (1603-1868) temari-making gradually became more of an art form. The functional stitching gave way to highly decorative embroidery and \u2013 because of the expensive silk thread used \u2013 became a pastime reserved for the nobility.", "description": "How the ancient Japanese art of temari captured the imagination of a new generation", "authors": ["Sarah Keating"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7q/b1/p07qb1t5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
