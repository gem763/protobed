Appointed in 2011 on the recommendation of Vern Cotter, veteran New Zealander Haig has done a fine job in his tenure so far, taking the Lelos to five Grand Slam Rugby Europe Championships in the last six years, and building a serious case for Six Nations inclusion with Italy stagnant.\n\nThe playing base is deeper, their U20s have made great strides and there is real excitement about where this side is going. Georgia has Haig to thank for much of that.\n\nKey Player\n\nMamuka Gorgodze. Beware \u2013 Gorgodzilla is coming to Japan. Two years after his international retirement Gorgodze has been enticed back to duties after a couple of injuries in the Georgian pack, ostensibly in the second row but with plenty of experience at the back of the scrum as well. Gorgodze was one of the under-the-radar stars of the last World Cup, named in the tournament\u2019s dream team and producing a player of the match performance against the All Blacks.\n\nIntensely physical but with hands softened by a youth spent playing basketball, even on aged legs Gorgodze will be a totemic figure.\n\nPast record\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (zero wins)\n\nFrance 2007 - eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nNew Zealand 2011 - eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nEngland 2015 - eliminated in the pool stages (two wins)\n\nPrediction\n\nDefeats to Australia and Wales seem likely, and Fiji should have too much quality, too. A win over Uruguay looks almost certain, and while just the sole victory would be a numerical step-back, their World Cup will be more about performances than results. If they can run either Australia or Wales remotely close, their claim for a Six Nations berth will only be bolstered.\n\nFixtures\n\nMonday 23 September \u2013 Wales vs Georgia (11.15am), Toyota\n\nSunday 29 September \u2013 Georgia vs Uruguay (6.15am), Kumagaya\n\nThursday 3 October \u2013 Georgia vs Fiji (6.15am), Higashiosaka\n\nFriday 11 October \u2013 Australia vs Georgia (11.15am), Fukuroi\n\nOdds\n\nGeorgia to win the World Cup: 750/1", "description": "Georgia\u00a0head to Japan for their fifth Rugby World Cup looking to prove their case for Six Nations inclusion after steady growth over the last decade or so.", "authors": ["Harry Latham-Coyle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/13/georgia.jpg"}
