But as the expansion has plodded on, the focus has shifted from having any job to having a good job, which workers see as rare.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really trying to do something about what jobs pay,\u201d Ms. Lake said.\n\nWith people increasingly open to more radical tools for accomplishing this, joining a union can seem downright middle of the road. According to recent polling by Pew Research Center, 42 percent of Americans view socialism favorably, up from 29 percent in 2010. During roughly that same time, support for unions has climbed significantly, from less than half to about two-thirds of Americans.\n\nThe increased openness to unions and collective bargaining has dovetailed with a palpable shift in expert opinion. For decades, economists tended to play down the importance of unions, attributing much of the increase in income inequality to a growing demand for skilled workers that resulted from automation and the spread of information technology. Some otherwise liberal economists were skeptical or even hostile to unions, seeing them as cartels that drove up wages for their members at the cost of reducing employment.\n\n\u201cI learned this in graduate school in macro \u2014 anti-union stuff from people who were highly inclined toward government redistribution,\u201d said the economist and columnist Noah Smith, who earned his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan and has written about economists\u2019 suspicion of unions. \u201cThere was this definite anti-union bias among liberals in the economics profession.\u201d\n\nBut in recent years, many economists have begun to reconsider those views. Partly this reflects a broader ideological shift in the country away from the market-friendly policy approach of the 1980s and \u201990s, which has lost credibility as inequality has widened. \u201cWe as social scientists live in a society where clearly the general social and political environment affects the questions we ask,\u201d said Arindrajit Dube, a labor economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nAnd partly this reflects a proliferation of research, which some of the campaigns have specifically cited, showing that employers have considerable power to hold down wages below the level the market would set.\n\nWhatever the case, there appears to be a growing consensus among center-left economists that unions are a critical check on the tendency of capital to vacuum up the gains from economic growth. A recent paper by economists at Princeton and Columbia showed that unions raised wages for low-skilled workers in the decades in which inequality was narrowing and concluded that unions have \u201chad a significant, equalizing effect on the income distribution.\u201d A recent paper by the centrist Hamilton Project concluded that \u201cunions lift wages, reduce inequality, and shape how work is organized.\u201d", "description": "Ambitious moves to shift power to workers are being embraced by several presidential candidates.", "authors": ["Noam Scheiber"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/business/11labor1/11labor1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
