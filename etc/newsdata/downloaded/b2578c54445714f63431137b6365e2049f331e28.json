I will stay in my lane. This is a job that coordinates different structures, function and systems of the DA,\" she said.\n\nZille added that she would only participate when its required to ensure the structures and systems work for everyone to do the same.\n\nZille emphasized that she respected and supported Maimane, adding that she would do her best to ensure the leadership was successful and takes the party to new heights.\n\nMaimane and Zille's relationship had been strained in the past few years, with the party leader having to haul his predecessor before the public to apologise over the tweets she made on colonialism in March 2017.\n\n#DAFedCo Zille says she will stay on her lane.
