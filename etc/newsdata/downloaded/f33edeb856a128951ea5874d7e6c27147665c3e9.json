That can mean giant shark battles, massive PvP modes, or even grand story adventures. While the newest update does have a big addition \u2014 a difficult \u201cfort of the damned\u201d with rare loot inside \u2014 it also has a smaller, sillier feature: the ability to change the colour of your underwear.\n\nCosmetics form the core of Sea of Thieves\u2019 progression system. Grind enough reputation or gather enough gold and you can gather a variety of dashing hats, golden swords and exclusive \u201cPirate Legend\u201d gear. Through it all, there\u2019s been one boring constant: dull, drab underwear.\n\nFinally, you can change the colour of your smallclothes and, in theory, change out your ragged and well-worn breeches. It\u2019s all thanks to a simple little widget that dyes clothing with a range of basic colours.\n\nIt\u2019s as simple as accessing the clothing chest on your ship and selecting a bottle of dye. No hassle, no bizarre quest to steal the ancient underwear potion of Captain Dread Pants, and no need to spend gold on colours. It\u2019s a pretty limited system for the moment, but I\u2019m hoping that an exciting range of designs and colours become available.\n\nA captain usually wears a heavy coat or fantastic dress, but every now and then you need to intimidate an enemy crew by running around half-naked. And at least now, you can do it with a little more style.", "description": "Sea of Thieves updates are usually pretty big.
