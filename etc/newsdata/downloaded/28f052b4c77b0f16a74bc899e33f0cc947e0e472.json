All the cells showed a good result in space,\" he added.\n\nAstronauts eat meat on board that is vacuum-packed or dried on Earth but this technology could ultimately be necessary for long voyages into deep space, said veteran cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko.\n\n\"If we're going to fly further from Earth to other planets in the solar system, we can't take that volume of food with us,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"In any case we will have to grow and produce food onboard the spaceship.\"\n\n\"I think progress is developing very quickly, science and knowledge, and I think this will be within our lifetimes,\" he said.\n\nCreating larger amounts of meat in the Russian segment will need more complex equipment than the current printer, said Khesuani.\n\n\"Then we can create not just small objects but big ones, made of a large mass of cells.\"\n\n\"I hope we will continue these experiments.\"\n\nOther space agencies are also carrying out experiments in this area as making human tissue in space is easier than in conditions of gravity.\n\nAn American 3D printer launched to the station in July can manufacture human tissue and is also being used for experiments by the European Space Agency.", "description": "The prospect of astronauts tucking into a roast dinner has grown slightly closer after a successful experiment used a 3D printer to create meat on the International Space Station.
