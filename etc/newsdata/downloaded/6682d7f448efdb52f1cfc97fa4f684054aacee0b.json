It\u2019s also Alexa- and Google Assistant-compatible.\n\nSANDISK MY PASSPORT DRIVE FOR TRAVEL\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of storing your data on somebody else\u2019s cloud. But you can secure your entire family\u2019s data on one drive. You can easily import photos, videos, documents and more on this hard drive. With password protection, you can even import content from your social media onto it.\n\nADD-A-LOCK TRAVELING DOOR LOCK\n\nYou go into an Airbnb or a hotel, you can put this device over the lock while you\u2019re inside to feel more secure (since there\u2019s likely to be more than one key to the place). It slips into an existing door lock, and works on almost every standard door.\n\nFLEXSAFE PORTABLE TRAVEL SAFE BY AQUAVAULT\n\nThis locks onto your lounge chair or even in your closet to secure your valuables as you travel. Don\u2019t use the safe in your hotel room. Instead, feel confident your belongings aren\u2019t going anywhere in this device.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Here are a few products to help keep your stuff safe this holiday season when you travel.", "authors": ["Kurt Knutsson"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/cyberattack-2-getty-51717_large-1b81be2e2b61c510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
