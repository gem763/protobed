But the Full Moon warns that a wholly irrational fear of you being set up to fail could hold you back. Ignore it. You\u2019ve too much going for you to waste time chasing shadows. CALL 0904 470 1167 (65p per minute)*\n\nSCORPIO 24 Oct-22 Nov You have plenty of secrets and with your ruler Pluto challenged by the Sun, you may feel you\u2019ve been betrayed. Possibly an ally has revealed something entrusted to them but that doesn\u2019t make it treachery. Is your own record whiter than white? CALL 0904 470 1168 (65p per minute)*\n\nSAGITTARIUS 23 Nov-21 Dec You may have to rethink plans to travel or escape routine tasks. But with the Sun brilliantly aspected by your ruler Jupiter, don\u2019t wander too far from base. Something spectacular is about to happen close to home and if you\u2019re not around, you will miss it. CALL 0904 470 1169 (65p per minute)*\n\nCAPRICORN 22 Dec-20 Jan Your feelings towards your nearest and dearest depend on whether you listen to your head or your heart this week. Today\u2019s particularly emotional Full Moon is likely to create discord, so be kind to those you love and, in theory, they should be kind in return. CALL 0904 470 1170 (65p per minute)*\n\nAQUARIUS 21 Jan-19 Feb Don\u2019t let unexpected news stop you enjoying a highly positive phase. A stunning Sun-Jupiter aspect ensures you\u2019ll be more concerned with expanding horizons than fretting over work or business commitments. If you have to make a break, make it quickly. CALL 0904 470 1171 (65p per minute)*\n\nPISCES 20 Feb-20 March Today\u2019s Full Moon makes you long for the past, but you can\u2019t turn back the clock and the sooner you look to the future, the sooner the heartache will pass. Don\u2019t identify too strongly with material items or your emotions will ricochet. CALL 0904 470 1172 (65p per minute)*\n\nARIES 21 March-20 April A project you thought was progressing well may have to be abandoned, but it\u2019s all part of life\u2019s rich tapestry. An Aries Full Moon may bring regrets, but only because you can\u2019t see the wood for the trees. You\u2019ll be happier once you glimpse the wider picture. CALL 0904 470 1161 (65p per minute)*\n\nTAURUS 21 April-21 May Your quandary over whether to move in a new direction will be solved this week when someone or something convinces you that there is more to life than merely existing. Deep down you long to be outrageously creative and will regret it if you don\u2019t. CALL 0904 470 1162 (65p per minute)*\n\nGEMINI 22 May-21 June This week will be either fantastic or frustrating, depending on whether you can find a suitable outlet for your energy. But don\u2019t let your emotions get out of hand or you risk spoiling a promising friendship that is not as close as you like to believe it is. CALL 0904 470 1163 (65p per minute)*\n\nCANCER 22 June-23 July Today\u2019s emotional midheaven Full Moon will bring out your jealous streak \u2013 much to your embarrassment when you return to normal later in the week. But while you may regret what you said, deep down you\u2019ll know you really meant it. CALL 0904 470 1164 (65p per minute)*\n\nLEO 24 July-23 Aug Friends and loved ones will try to restrict your movements this week just to stop you hurting yourself. If you are wise, you\u2019ll reassure them that you\u2019re not taking serious risks. You also need to reassure yourself that you are not sticking your neck out too far. CALL 0904 470 1165 (65p per minute)*\n\nVIRGO 24 Aug-23 Sept A lucky Sun-Jupiter union enables you to turn potential into profit, daydreams into deeds. No need to be a world-beater, just be yourself. Too often you\u2019ve failed to make the most of your talents; now you\u2019ve the will, ability and, above all, the hunger to be a star.
