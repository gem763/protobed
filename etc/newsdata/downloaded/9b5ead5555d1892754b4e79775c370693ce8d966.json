Users can interact with it via a pegging mechanism; they send funds to and from the sidechain, with security features ensuring coins are not available on both chains at once.\n\nSidechains have existed for several years and have various functions depending on developers\u2019 aims.\n\nBlockstream\u2019s Liquid sidechain, or LBTC, for example, focuses on interexchange operability while giving traders enhanced features not yet available on the Bitcoin mainchain.\n\nBinance Chain leads balances\n\nLiquid, which launched in October 2018, currently includes a modest 89 BTC ($709,700). That figure is dwarfed by the largest sidechain, Binance Chain, which has 9,001 BTC ($71.74 million).\n\nEven the Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) sidechain, which is in fact an Ethereum-based ERC-20 standard token, has 571 BTC ($4.55 million) \u2014 more than Liquid.\n\nWBTC debuted in January this year, while Binance Chain \u2014 cryptocurrency exchange Binance\u2019s in-house project \u2014 got its mainnet unveiling in April.\n\nThis week, wallet provider Blockchain and digital asset manager CoinShares launched a Bitcoin sidechain of their own in the form of a gold token network.", "description": "Three major Bitcoin sidechains currently have a combined balance of over 9,000 BTC, or $71 million", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYzIyYTMxMGZkZGZmNzg5OTI2NzA0NDJiYmQyZDcwY2MuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
