Studio Ghibli are bringing their out-of-this-world animations to streaming services for the first time.\n\nThe iconic Japanese animation house has inked a deal with HBO\u2019s new on-demand platform HBO Max, which is launching in the US in April 2020. When the streaming service goes live, 21 Studio Ghibli films will be available, including Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl\u2019s Moving Castle and the Oscar-winning Spirited Away. So get ready to be dazzled by lush landscapes, fantastical characters, and to fall in love with No-Face, Jiji and Catbus all over again.\n\nIt\u2019s a surprising turn for the legendary animation studio \u2014 previously, Studio Ghibli\u2019s US distributor GKids has aired anti-streaming views. \u201cStudio Ghibli does not make their films available digitally, whether for download or streaming, anywhere in the world,\u201d a spokesperson said to Polygon earlier this year. \u201cThey continue to believe that presentation is vital and particularly appreciate opportunities for audiences to experience the films together in a theatrical setting.\u201d\n\nBut the new move signals Studio Ghibli are catching up with the reality of how people enjoy their films. HBO Max has only been announced for a 2020 launch in the US at this time. In the UK, HBO has big deals with Sky Atlantic and Now TV to sync their shows, so it\u2019s possible that you\u2019ll see Ghibli films on one of those platforms in the not-too-distant future.\n\nIn the meantime while you wait for the glorious arrival of dreamy anime on demand, please enjoy this supercut of the mouth-watering food in Ghibli films. It\u2019s literally self-care.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "Hayao Miyazaki-helmed animation house to break digital embargo in 2020 with HBO hook-up.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5da98b0d3116b2000a62a098/lede/1571393649127-spirited-away-splash.jpeg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
