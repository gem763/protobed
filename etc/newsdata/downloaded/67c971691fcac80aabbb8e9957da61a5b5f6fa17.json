LOUIS | Veteran right-hander Anibal Sanchez, with an assortment of off-speed pitches and guile, did not allow a hit until the eighth inning and the Washington Nationals beat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-0 in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series on Friday night at Busch Stadium.\n\nThe 35-year-old Sanchez had not beaten the Cardinals since June 27, 2012, when he pitched for the Miami Marlins. The native of Venezuela retired the first nine batters he faced before allowing a walk and didn\u2019t give up a hit until two outs in the eighth as pinch-hitter Jose Martinez lined a clean single to center.\n\nThat brought on lefty reliever Sean Doolittle, who retired the next batter to end the eighth.\n\nDoolittle stayed on to start the ninth and got the last three outs as the Nationals took a 1-0 series lead.\n\nThe Nationals scored their first run in NLCS history in the top of the second before a sellout crowd of 45,075 red-clad fans on a 45-degree night.\n\nWashington\u2019s Howie Kendrick, the hero of Game 5 Wednesday at the Los Angeles Dodgers, led off with a double against Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas.\n\nTwo outs later Yan Gomes smoked a double to left-center to score Kendrick and give the Nationals a 1-0 lead.\n\nGomes got the start at catcher after regular Kurt Suzuki was hit with a pitch on Wednesday. Suzuki took batting practice Friday.\n\n\u201cWe need to be cautious,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said of Suzuki. \u201cWhen it comes to a head injury, we got to make sure that he\u2019s good to go.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals loaded the bases in the fifth, but Juan Soto grounded out for the third out to end the threat off Mikolas.\n\nThe Cardinals have been upset with the antics of Soto in the batter\u2019s box, and Mikolas appeared to grab his crotch after Soto grounded out. The Cardinals feel Soto does the same thing at times.\n\n\u201cHe does have a lot of things he does that make him uniquely different than everyone else,\u201d Cardinals pitcher Adam Wainwright said before the game. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say about that.\u201d\n\nMikolas gave up just the one run on seven hits before he was taken out after six innings.\n\nWashington put runners on the corner with two outs in the seventh for Kendrick, whose single against reliever John Brebbia gave the Nationals a 2-0 lead.\n\nMichael A. Taylor got the start in center again as Victor Robles deals with a sore hamstring.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s about 80 to 85 percent,\u201d Martinez said of Robles. \u201cLike I said before, with Michael playing center field we don\u2019t miss much defensively.\u201d\n\nGame 2 will be Saturday at 4:08 p.m. with St. Louis native Max Scherzer going against Wainwright, a veteran for the Cardinals.\n\nScherzer doesn\u2019t get too sentimental about being back home. He is 2-2 with a 2.56 ERA in five career starts here.\n\n\u201cYeah, grew up here but at this point in time really doesn\u2019t mean anything because I got a bigger task at hand and that\u2019s to go out there and win it for the Nats,\u201d he said.\n\nScherzer pitched against the Cardinals here last month. \u201cIt\u2019s fresh in my mind of what pitches they can hit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough fight, I know that.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals certainly didn\u2019t hit much against Sanchez on Friday.\n\nGame 3 of the series will be Monday at Nationals Park with the first pitch at 7:38 p.m. ET.\n\nGame 4 will be Tuesday at 8:05 p.m. ET and Game 5, if needed, will be Wednesday at 4:08 p.m.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
