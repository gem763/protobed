A major agreement has eluded the two sides, even as Trump has sought a success on the trade front in the run-up to the 2020 campaign season.\n\n\u201cAll of the costs of it, the tariffs, the retaliation that people have put on, he\u2019s paid the price for, during his presidency,\u201d Kushner said.\n\nThe top Chinese diplomat in the U.S. agreed that \u201cthe trade war is still taking tolls on both sides\u201d and echoed some of Kushner\u2019s optimism during a separate event.\n\n\u201cOur trade talks made substantial headway about two weeks ago,\u201d Ambassador Cui Tiankai said Monday in Houston, Texas. \u201cWe hope that China and the U.S. will continue their dialogue and negotiation on the basis of equality and mutual respect and come to a win-win situation.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s team hopes to finalize the deal in time to sign the \u201cphase one\u201d agreement during an economic summit in Chile next month.\n\n\"If it\u2019s not signed in Chile, that doesn\u2019t mean that it falls apart. It just means that it\u2019s not ready,\u201d a Trump administration official said Tuesday.. \u201cOur goal is to sign it in Chile. But sometimes texts aren\u2019t ready. But good progress is being made, and we expect to sign the agreement in Chile.\u201d", "description": "United States and Chinese negotiators have reached \u201ca fabulous deal\u201d to ease trade tensions between the economic heavyweights, according to White House senior adviser Jared Kushner.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57db493/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2288x1201+0+60/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2Fb5%2F1a%2F35b97d2447dd8a1c636667fd90ad%2Fjared-ivanka.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
