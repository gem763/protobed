The infection has killed a quarter of the world\u2019s pigs since spreading to Asia from Europe about a year ago, Andrae added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine ... so it can wipe out the entire herd,\u201d she said, adding that the other raw animal products carried by the woman also posed a biosecurity risk.\n\nAustralia\u2019s stringent biosecurity laws have in the past ensnared some high-profile figures.\n\nIn 2015, Australia gave Hollywood actor Johnny Depp two days to return his two pet dogs to the United States for failing to declare them to customs.", "description": "Australia has refused entry to a Vietnamese woman for failing to declare 10 kg (22 lb) of raw pork, seafood and poultry on arrival in Sydney, its first expulsion under a more strict biosecurity law, authorities said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
