Trump also has sought to relax Obama-era federal mileage standards nationwide, weakening a key effort by his Democratic predecessor to slow climate change.\n\nThe White House declined to comment Tuesday, referring questions to EPA. EPA\u2019s press office did not respond to a phone message and email seeking comment.\n\nBut EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association on Tuesday that the Trump administration would move \u201cin the very near future\u201d to take steps toward establishing one nationwide set of fuel-economy standards.\n\n\u201cWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,\u201d he said, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.\n\nWord of the pending announcement came as Trump traveled to California on Tuesday for an overnight trip that includes GOP fundraising events near San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s authority to set its own, tougher emissions standards goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California\u2019s fuel economy standards.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Tuesday that the Trump administration\u2019s action will hurt both U.S. automakers and American families. He said California would fight the administration in federal court. Environmental groups also pledged legal action.\n\n\u201cThe evidence is irrefutable: today\u2019s clean car standards are achievable, science-based, and a boon for hardworking American families and public health,\u201d said Becerra, a Democrat. \u201cIt\u2019s time to remove your blinders, President Trump, and acknowledge that the only person standing in the way of progress is you.\u201d\n\nThe deal struck in July between California and four of the world\u2019s largest automakers \u2014 Ford F, -0.22% , Honda HMC, -0.07% , BMW BMW, -0.88% and Volkswagen VOW, -0.84% \u2014 bypassed the Trump administration\u2019s plan to freeze emissions and fuel economy standards adopted under Obama at 2021 levels.\n\nThe four automakers agreed with California to reduce emissions by 3.7% per year starting with the 2022 model year, through 2026. That compares with 4.7% yearly reductions through 2025 under the Obama standards. Emissions standards are closely linked with fuel economy requirements because vehicles pollute less if they burn fewer gallons of fuel.\n\nThe U.S. transportation sector is the nation\u2019s biggest single source of planet-warming greenhouse gasses.\n\nWheeler said Tuesday: \u201cCalifornia will be able to keep in place and enforce programs to address smog and other forms of air pollution caused by motor vehicles.\u201d But fuel economy has been one of the key regulatory tools the state has used to reduce harmful emissions.\n\nEnvironmentalists condemned the Trump administration\u2019s expected announcement.\n\n\u201cEveryone wins when we adopt strong clean car standards as our public policy,\u201d said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cStrong clean car standards give us healthier air to breathe, help protect us from the urgent threat of climate change and save Americans hundreds of dollars a year in gas expenses.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration is poised to revoke California\u2019s authority to set auto mileage standards, asserting that only the federal government has the power...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HE384_traffi_ZG_20190221165250.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
