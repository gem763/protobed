It was a difficult argument to make, even to the magazine\u2019s editor, Adam Rapoport, a Washington native.\n\n\u201cHe laughed,\u201d Mr. Knowlton recalled. \u201cThen he told me to get out of his office. He didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\nIn the end, the city won that honor, and has since drawn similar recognition from other food-world arbiters, even getting its own Michelin Guide. But it still chafes under a reputation that has bedeviled its dining scene for decades: that it has little culinary excitement or any distinctive identity. In this view, the strivers coursing through the capital\u2019s halls of power represent the entire population; luxury, status and predictability rule in the kitchen, and the best meal to be had is a dry-aged steak.\n\nTruth is, District of Columbia restaurants are far more interesting than that, and have been for a long time. The vibrant scene now attracting attention rose on a foundation built by members of a culinary deep state , and a diverse constellation of restaurants that have flourished here.", "description": "The capital\u2019s dining scene has gotten a bad rap as stodgy, status-driven and lacking a strong identity.
