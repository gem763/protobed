All are to be expelled.\n\nWhen Soames was asked if this was the end of the Conservative Party his grandfather would have known, he said: \"No. But it's a bad night.\n\n\"It is a pity - a great pity - that this has in my view all been planned: this is exactly what they wanted and they will try to have a general election which is what they wanted.\"\n\nSince he took office as prime minister six weeks ago, Johnson has been ruthless: He oversaw one of the biggest purges of cabinet ministers in modern British history and has cut short a session of parliament to increase the likelihood Britain will leave the EU, with or without a deal.\n\nWinston Churchill.

I knew what I was doing.\"\n\nSoames, 71, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2014, has been a member of parliament since 1983 and previously served as a junior defense minister.

Churchill was quite the greatest statesman that Britain had ever produced.\"\n\nAs a young boy, Soames said he was unaware of his grandfather's significance and has recounted how, when aged five, he once visited Churchill in his bedroom and asked him: \"Grandpapa, is it true that you are the greatest man in the world?\"\n\nChurchill replied: \"Yes, now bugger off.\"\n\nRead more: Boris Johnson loses his majority after Conservative MP Phillip Lee dramatically crosses floor to join the Liberal Democrats\n\nAndrew Adonis, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said Churchill would have deselected from Conservative if it was run like it is now because he opposed then prime minister Neville Chamberlain attempt to secure peace with Germany's Adolf Hitler a year before World War Two.\n\n\"Churchill himself would have been deselected,\" he said. \"Chamberlain bitterly attacked him for 'undermining his negotiating position' at Munich and there was a deselection attempt.\"\n\nA source close to the group who have voted against the government said Tuesday's vote is the first step in a process to avert an economically damaging no-deal exit.\n\n\"No. 10 have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill's grandson,\" the source said. \"What has happened to the Conservative Party?\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Kate Holton, Elizabeth Piper and William James; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge", "description": "The move against the Conservative Party marks one of the most bizarre turns in the Brexit crisis.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Andrew Macaskill"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6f3fa52e22af09216aa404-1920-960.jpg"}
