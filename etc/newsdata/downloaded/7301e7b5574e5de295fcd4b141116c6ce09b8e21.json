All are to be expelled.\n\nWhen Soames was asked whether this was the end of the Conservative Party his grandfather would have known, he said: \"No. But it's a bad night.\n\n\"It is a pity \u2014 a great pity \u2014 that this has in my view all been planned: This is exactly what they wanted and they will try to have a general election, which is what they wanted.\"\n\nSince he took office as prime minister six weeks ago, Johnson has been ruthless: He oversaw one of the biggest purges of cabinet ministers in modern British history and has cut short a session of Parliament to increase the likelihood Britain will leave the EU, with or without a deal.\n\nWinston Churchill.
