USA TODAY\n\nATLANTA \u2014 The easy narrative Sunday when two of the NFL\u2019s most disappointing teams met at Mercedes-Benz Stadium was that one of them would emerge with a chance to turn around their season, while the other would reach the point of no return.\n\nBut it's now clear that this was a mischaracterization. Whatever problems the Los Angeles Rams have had the last few weeks are nothing compared to the utter chaos and dysfunction that has ensnared the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nWhen it comes to a season swirling the drain, the Falcons proved the Rams aren't even in their league as L.A. coasted to a 37-10 win. Atlanta, a team many experts predicted to contend for the NFC title, has fallen to a stunning 1-6 while the Rams stopped a three-game losing streak and improved to 4-3. Here are three things we learned from this one:\n\n1. Dan Quinn's job is really in jeopardy\n\nThough it\u2019s unclear what owner Arthur Blank\u2019s intentions are, the Falcons\u2019 coach shouldn\u2019t feel too confident he\u2019ll have a job much longer. This team is a mess on both sides of the ball, but the defense is Quinn\u2019s baby. Atlanta was 27th in the NFL coming into this game in total defense and 31st in points allowed at 31 per game. Nothing we saw against the Rams showed any sign of improvement, as the Rams finished with 381 yards of offense. Another key stat that speaks directly to preparation: Atlanta has a minus-70 point differential in first halves this season, the worst mark in the league.\n\nAtlanta plays the Seattle Seahawks at home next Sunday, and many have pointed to the subsequent bye week as a sensible time to execute a coaching change. But after getting embarrassed at home yet again in front of tens of thousands of empty seats, what's the point in waiting?\n\n2. The Rams\u2019 offense showed signs of life\n\nComing off their Super Bowl loss last season, the Rams have a huge target on their back. So does coach Sean McVay, in a sense, as teams have now had a couple years to look closely at his offense and make adjustments. When the San Francisco 49ers held the Rams to 157 yards of offense last week, some critics were asking if McVay has been \u201cfigured out.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, playing the Falcons gave the Rams a confidence boost as they only punted once in each half and slammed the door on this game with a strong nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive to take a 20-3 lead coming out of halftime.\n\nQuarterback Jared Goff missed a few throws, but he didn\u2019t make any big mistakes, either, completing 22 of 37 passes for 268 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He also executed a pretty impressive juke on Falcons linebacker Deion Jones as he waltzed in for a 1-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.\n\nL.A. also did a nice job of getting rookie running back Darrell Henderson more involved. Henderson, a third-round draft pick out of Memphis, supplemented Todd Gurley\u2019s 18 carries with 11 of his own for 31 yards and caught a pass out of the backfield.\n\n3. Jalen Ramsey was a difference-maker\n\nRamsey, the two-time Pro Bowl defensive back, made his debut Sunday after getting traded from Jacksonville and was essentially glued to Falcons star receiver Julio Jones throughout the game.\n\nThough Jones caught six passes for 93 yards, including beating Ramsey on one deep ball late in the first half for a 39-yard gain, Ramsey was largely effective in making sure he didn\u2019t get open. His ability to play Jones one-on-one also allowed the Rams to focus on the Falcons\u2019 other weapons, and they really struggled to move the ball for most of the game.\n\nAtlanta only had 224 yards, 75 of which came on a late touchdown drive led by backup quarterback Matt Schaub, who came in after Matt Ryan suffered an unspecified ankle injury.\n\nFollow Dan Wolken on Twitter @DanWolken.", "description": "The Rams broke a three-game slide by coming on strong against a Falcons team that can't seem to find its footing this season.", "authors": ["Dan Wolken", "Published P.M.
