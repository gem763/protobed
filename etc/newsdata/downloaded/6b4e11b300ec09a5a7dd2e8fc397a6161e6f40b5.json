Most notably, plans for a basic income usually assumed that these checks would be a substitute for the existing social welfare state.\n\nSince that system has been bad news for both taxpayers and poor people, a swap sounds very tempting.\n\nBut I\u2019ve repeatedly warned (over and over again) that any theoretical attributes don\u2019t matter because politicians almost certainly would pull a bait-and-switch by adding a basic income on top of all current redistribution programs.\n\nAndrew Yang is now proving my point. When asked about potential budgetary savings to accompany his proposal for basic income, the candidate for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination asserted that the new handouts would be in addition to the existing welfare state.\n\n.@cenkuygur asked @AndrewYang what welfare programs he'd end or decrease funding in order to do #UBI\n\n\n\n\"I would not touch any of our existing programs.

Especially if the wrong people are in charge.\n\nIndeed, this wariness shall be enshrined as our \u201cFifth Theorem of Government.\u201d\n\nThis Theorem is rather useful when contemplating certain issues.\n\nAnd now we know it applies to discussions of basic income.\n\nP.S. Here are the other four theorems.\n\nThe \u201cFirst Theorem\u201d explains how Washington really operates.\n\nThe \u201cSecond Theorem\u201d explains why it is so important to block the creation of new programs.\n\nThe \u201cThird Theorem\u201d explains why centralized programs inevitably waste money.\n\nThe \u201cFourth Theorem\u201d explains that good policy can be good politics.\n\nP.P.S. All these theorems are actually just elements of \u201cpublic choice,\u201d which is the common-sense economic theory that people in the public sector largely are seeking to benefit themselves.", "description": "When \u201cbasic income\u201d became an issue a few years ago, .09/25/2019 0:36:18AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
