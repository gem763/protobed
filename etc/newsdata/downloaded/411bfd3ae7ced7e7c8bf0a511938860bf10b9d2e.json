Some also noted how far U.S. policy had shifted from the 1940s, when Washington co-founded the IMF.\n\nAt that time, \"the world economy had been hammered for over a decade by high tariff barriers, depression and war,\" prompting then-U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau to champion a global economic system, World Bank President David Malpass told attendees at a session this week.\n\nThe U.S. message then, Malpass said, was: \"First, there\u2019s no limit to prosperity. Second, broadly shared prosperity benefits everyone.\"\n\nAs the IMF's gathering of 189 member-nations drew to a close, the unintended negative impacts of the trade wars were becoming clear, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said. \"Everybody loses.\"\n\nThe United States, the world's largest importer, started a bitter tariff war with China, the world's largest exporter, 15 months ago. U.S. President Donald Trump is also in the midst of renegotiating, and sometimes upending, trade relationships with many of Washington's top trading partners.\n\nThe fallout will slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the slowest pace in a decade, the IMF estimated this week.\n\nThis pain is not being shared equally. The United States remains the least exposed of the world's 20 largest economies to a drop in exports in part because of its massive domestic consumer spending base.\n\n(Here's a graphic that shows the impact of tariffs in the United States and around the world. https://tmsnrt.rs/2OZJQba)\n\n\n\n\n\nEUROPE'S PAIN\n\nThe damage is being particularly felt in European countries which \"rely on exports and are open to trade,\" the European Union's Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.\n\nMore than 40% of Germany's GDP was derived from exports in 2018, the most of any major global economy. Uncertainty in the business community is widespread, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told reporters.\n\nGerman trade group BGA recently revised down its growth forecast for German exports in 2019 to just 0.5%, from 1.5%. As a result, many companies are scaling back their investment plans, something that will have repercussions for years to come.\n\nScholz said concerns over Britain\u2019s impending departure from the EU and the bloc's trade dispute with the United States were clearly dampening global economic growth.\n\n\"The most important problem remains those factors that we cannot measure \u2013 specifically the reluctance to invest,\" Scholz said.\n\nThe pain is being felt in countries that don't rely on exports too, such as Iceland, which became the first developed economy to seek aid from the IMF after a 2008 banking collapse. Since then, it has rebuilt its economy in what\u2019s been called a miraculous recovery. Now, that is threatened.\n\n\"We have become dependent on tourism,\" explained \u00c1sgeir J\u00f3nsson, the governor of Iceland's central bank, with annual visitors growing five-fold to 2.5 million since the crisis. Foreign arrivals, however, have plummeted since the trade wars started, and are down 15.6% this summer from the year before.\n\nIceland, with a population of about 300,000, built foreign currency reserves on the back of the increase in visitors, he said, but those are dropping too.\n\nTrade links between countries have led to a more peaceful world in recent decades, but recent experience shows \"you can never take global trade for granted,\" J\u00f3nsson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNO AMERICAN IMMUNITY\n\nOn Friday, Japan's Cabinet Office, which helps coordinate government policy, downgraded its assessment of factory output in October.\n\nThe softness in production was largely due to car exports to the United States turning weaker, after growing steadily until the spring, a government official said at a briefing.\n\n\"The pick-up in global growth is being delayed,\" Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said. \"Japan\u2019s economy is seeing exports weaken significantly and that\u2019s affecting factory output.\"\n\nThe United States hasn't been immune from the impact of the trade wars. American farmers have been particularly hurt by Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, prompting the Trump administration to give billions in aid to the farm belt.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The collateral damage of the United States' trade wars is being felt from the fjords of Iceland to the auto factories of Japan.
