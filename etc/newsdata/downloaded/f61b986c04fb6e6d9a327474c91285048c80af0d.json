But they\u2019re an essential piece of safety kit year round in all weathers, almost akin to the helmet.\n\nThe lens is of course the most important element \u2013 this is what\u2019s going to stop debris or a fly hitting your eye, and also protect from wind, water and UV rays.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for sunglasses to ride in sunny conditions specifically, look for a category-3 rated lens \u2013 these will have a heavily reflective or tinted lens and offer a high level of UV protection. However, for more changeable and cloudy conditions, a category 2 or even 1 lens will work, as they provide some UV protection and you\u2019ll be more focused on shielding your face from wind and debris rather than sun.\n\nA fantastic option for unpredictable UK weather is the photochromic lens, as it works equally well in overcast rainy conditions as it does in full sunshine. The lenses respond to changing light levels by increasing or decreasing their darkness.\n\nA number of sunglasses also have interchangeable lenses. These will not only adapt to different scenarios (low light, cloudy, full sun), but if they get scratched, you can easily \u2013 and cheaply \u2013 replace with a new lens.\n\nWe tested a range of cycling glasses with varying lens types to find you the best shades on the market.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.
