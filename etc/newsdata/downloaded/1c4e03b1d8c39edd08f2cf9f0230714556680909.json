Amazon AMZN, -0.59% founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos\u2019 fortune would be about $87 billion versus the $160 billion it was estimated at last year. Microsoft MSFT, -1.05% founder Bill Gates would have seen his wealth cut to $36 billion from $97 billion. And Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s BRK.A, +0.73% BRK.B, +0.82% Warren Buffett would be sitting on about $27 billion instead of $88 billion.\n\nThose figures assume a wealth tax going back to 1982, and come from a paper authored by two economists who helped to write Warren\u2019s own plan. It\u2019s one of several proposals that may be in the spotlight when the Massachusetts senator debates nine fellow Democratic presidential contenders on Thursday in Houston.\n\nAlso see: Here\u2019s who America\u2019s CEOs are backing in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nWarren, currently holding the No.2 spot behind Joe Biden in an average of presidential polls, has proposed an annual 2% tax on every dollar of net worth above $50 million, and a 3% tax on each dollar of net worth above $1 billion.\n\nWarren has said her wealth-tax plan would raise money to fund her proposals such as universal free public college and canceling student debt.\n\nNow read: Elizabeth Warren wants to wipe away $640 billion in student debt \u2014 with a tax on the rich.\n\nThe paper, by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley, finds that the top 15 wealthiest Americans as estimated by Forbes magazine would collectively have seen their net worth drop to just under $434 billion had Warren\u2019s plan been in effect since 1982. That\u2019s down from about $942 billion.\n\nFacebook FB, -1.37% founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle ORCL, +1.71% chairman Larry Ellison are Nos. 4 and 5 on the list.\n\nBuffett, for one, has argued for higher taxes on the wealthy. Meanwhile, groups like the Tax Foundation have said it\u2019s unclear if Warren\u2019s proposal is constitutional. She has cited scholars who say it is.", "description": "Some of the richest businesspeople in the U.S. could be much less rich today if Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax had been in place.", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GM580_bezos__ZG_20180716131750.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
