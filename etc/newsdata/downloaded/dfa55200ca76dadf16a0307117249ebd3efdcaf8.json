The plaintiffs \u2013 New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, New Mexico and Oregon \u2013 also name SEC Chairman Jay Clayton in the suit, which claims Reg BI undermines critical protections for retail investors, increases investor confusion about brokers versus advisors, and makes it easier for brokers to market themselves as \u201ctrusted advisers\u201d while still being able to give conflicted advice.\n\nIn other wealth management news this week:\n\nXYPN joins the fray. XY Planning Network, the coalition of fee-only financial planners, also filed a suit against the SEC. It contends Reg BI hands an unfair competitive advantage to broker-dealers. The lawsuit, like the states\u2019 lawsuit, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. XYPN\u2019s arguments mirror those of the states. It contends that Reg BI ignores a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that says regulations for broker-dealers should be no less stringent than those for RIAs when it comes to delivering financial advice.\n\nBrokers in limbo. Again. The states\u2019 lawsuit against the SEC\u2019s Reg BI creates a big question mark within the broker-dealer industry, just as lawsuits against its predecessor, the DOL fiduciary rule, did. Lawyers representing the industry note that the compliance deadline for the Regulation Best Interest \u2013 June 30, 2020 \u2013 will come quickly. The best outcome, according to Jonathan Brennan, the former chief of wealth management litigation at Merrill Lynch, would be for the courts to provide finality and clarity on the rule.\n\nWealthfront assets blowing up. Robo-advisor Wealthfront is reporting that new products, including high-yielding savings accounts, have helped it double its assets to $20 billion in the past eight months. The firm didn\u2019t disclose how much of that $20 billion came from assets invested in brokerage accounts versus deposits in the new high-interest cash accounts launched in February. But the robo-advisor\u2019s most recently filed Form ADV, dated August 13, reports it has $11.4 billion in assets under management. It would seem the new cash accounts have brought in at least $8 billion more, but the company would not confirm that.\n\nWe will disrupt you. Altruist \u2013 a new digital, commission-free custodian for RIAs \u2013 will save advisors up to 90% on technology and custody costs, founder Jason Wenk promises. Big firms like Charles Schwab , Fidelity and Pershing have a seeming lock on the business, but Wenk and Altruist believe they can beat them based on cost. Altruist plans a public beta version of its advisor portal in October, and would be able to serve clients following certification as a broker-dealer and qualified custodian, as soon as November.\n\nHave a great weekend.", "description": "Barron\u2019s Advisor rounds up the week\u2019s top wealth management news.", "authors": ["Steve Garmhausen"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-107298/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
