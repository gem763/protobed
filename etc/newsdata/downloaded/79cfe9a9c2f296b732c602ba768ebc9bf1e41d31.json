She also knows that when Republicans in the House impeached Bill Clinton in 1998 \u2013 the move was not subsequently supported by the Senate \u2013 a number of senior Republicans suffered at the hands of voters when they next went to the polls.\n\nThe clearest indication of how Mr Trump\u2019s supporters will react to the move, came from the president himself who immediately responded in a tweet storm while still in New York, where earlier in the day he addressed the United Nations General Assembly.\n\n\u201cSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage. So bad for our country,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThey never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!\u201d\n\nHe added, in capital letters: \u201cPRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!\u201c\n\nAn impeachment inquiry had already technically been underway since Jerry Nadler, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, last month filed a series of legal motions seeking specially protected evidence from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut the announcement by Ms Pelosi, who told members of her party that investigative work currently being carried out by six Democratic-controlled committees should operate under an impeachment umbrella, indicates the move now has her full support and is being carried out in the name of the most powerful woman in Washington.\n\nReports suggested the six various committees would examine the most egregious examples they can find of Mr Trump\u2019s behaviour and the party would decide whether there was sufficient evidence to move forward to a vote, first by the Judiciary Committee, and then the full House.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

On Tuesday morning at the UN, he was defending the contents of his July 25 conversation with Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged him to investigate Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden and his son.\n\nMr Trump promised to release a transcript of his phone call. He also confirmed he had withheld nearly $400m in US aid to Ukraine but denied he did so as leverage to get Mr Zelensky to initiate an investigation that would damage the former vice president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supporting a country. We want to make sure that country\u2019s honest,\u201d Mr Trump had told reporters on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption \u2013 why would you give money to a country you think is corrupt?\u201d\n\nMr Trump found himself in hot water earlier this month after it was revealed a whistleblower, believed to be a member of the US intelligence services, had raised the issue of the president\u2019s call.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff said the official who first made the complaint about the phonecall had made contact with Joseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence (DNI).\n\n\u201cWe have been informed by the whistleblower\u2019s counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the acting DNI as to how to do so,\u201d Mr Schiff tweeted.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower\u2019s testimony as soon as this week.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Nancy Pelosi has announced Democrats are pushing ahead with a formal impeachment investigation of Donald Trump, triggering t", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/17/pelosi-impeach.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
