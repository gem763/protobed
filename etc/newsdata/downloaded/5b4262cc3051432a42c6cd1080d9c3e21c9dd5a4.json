Some European leaders have voiced reluctance to give Britain more time, though an orderly exit is widely accepted as being least damaging scenario for both the U.K. and the EU.\n\nA verdict from the EU could come as early as Monday, while Johnson will be seeking to pass his deal in British parliament early this week. The British government insisted on Sunday that the country will leave the EU on Oct. 31 despite Johnson's letter, though Britain's Sunday Times newspaper reported that the EU will delay until February 2020 if Johnson fails to pass his deal with domestic lawmakers this week.\n\nSterling slipped from a five-month high on Monday morning, sliding just over 0.5% against the dollar to trade at $1.2902 before European market open.\n\nAsian markets traded mixed on Monday amid the protracted uncertainty, with mainland Chinese indexes leading losses and Japanese shares advancing.", "description": "European stocks were seen cautiously higher Monday morning as traders wait to discover whether the U.K.'s departure from the European Union will be delayed once again.", "authors": ["Elliot Smith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106186945-1571312842014gettyimages-1181424689.jpeg?v=1571312871", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
