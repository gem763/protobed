None of the other 14 teams currently seem capable of reaching their elite level of play, though there's plenty of time left. So it increasingly feels as though it's just a question of whether the conference championship game will take place in Kansas City or in Foxborough.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s no clear-cut leader in the NFC yet. Entering Week 5, seven teams had three wins apiece. There isn\u2019t a super team among that pack. For every sign of promise, each of those teams has also displayed a degree of vulnerability, whether in the area of performance, cohesion or health.\n\nIf not for Drew Brees\u2019 thumb injury, the Saints very well could have gotten off to a perfect start. It looks as if Teddy Bridgewater will manage to play at a level to help New Orleans tread water long enough until Brees returns. The Rams \u2014 despite still ranking among the top teams in the conference \u2014 have appeared disjointed, dropping consecutive games to the Buccaneers and the Seahawks, as they try to avoid falling prey to that Super Bowl hangover.\n\nMeanwhile, the resurgent Packers, a gritty Seahawks team, a Bears squad fueled by a dominant defense and a hungry Cowboys team all seem equipped to challenge within the conference. The 2-2 Eagles also should not be overlooked. They have losses to Atlanta (1-3) and Detroit (2-0-1), but they looked like a playoff team in a big win at Green Bay in Week 4.\n\nThis conference could be in for a dogfight in December.\n\nWeek 5 picks:Cowboys or Packers in battle of 3-1 teams?\n\n\u2022 Potential breakouts: Strong initial statements by these players and teams seemingly are a sign of bigger things to come.\n\nLamar Jackson \u2014No player has displayed more dramatic signs of growth. When he took over as the Ravens\u2019 starting quarterback in the second half of his rookie season, Jackson scared teams with his legs, but they didn\u2019t have to worry much about his passing. But in the early stretch of his second season, Jackson looks like a legitimate dual threat. He's completing nearly 65% of his passes while ranking among the league's best in quarterback rating (109.4). He hasn't had to run as much as last season, but Jackson remains just as potent on the ground. As a result, Baltimore looks like a contender in the AFC North.\n\nShaquil Barrett \u2014 For five seasons, Barrett put up pedestrian numbers (14 sacks) in limited work with the Broncos. But after signing a one-year deal with Tampa Bay this offseason, the linebacker is enjoying a career season. Thriving in Todd Bowles\u2019 system, Barrett has nine sacks, three forced fumbles and an interception in four games.\n\nTerry McLaurin \u2014 A third-round pick out of Ohio State, McLaurin has surprised many by making an impact as a well-rounded receiving threat. He's effective as both a possession receiver and a deep threat while averaging 85.7 yards per game. With three touchdowns on the season, McLaurin is the lone bright spot on Washington\u2019s offense.\n\nGardner Minshew and Kyle Allen \u2014 Injuries to Nick Foles and Cam Newton should have spelled doom for the Jaguars and Panthers. Instead, these young backup quarterbacks have played surprisingly well, keeping their teams in contention. Minshew Mania has received more recognition thanks to the rookie\u2019s throwback fashion sense, but with seven touchdowns and just one interception, he has reason to carry himself with a swagger. Meanwhile, Allen has helped direct the Panthers to a pair of road wins.\n\n49ers \u2014 They haven\u2019t been perfect. They\u2019ve committed too many turnovers on offense. However, the 49ers have certainly made significant strides in Year 3 under Kyle Shanahan and John Lynch, and they\u2019ve managed to overcome self-inflicted wounds to remain perfect out of the gates. A strong defense and potent running game have helped ease pressure on Jimmy Garoppolo as he continues to work his way after missing the bulk of last season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. They certainly appear to have the makings of a contender, but the next two weeks will be telling. They have their first prime-time game on Monday, hosting a rebounding Browns team, and then they face the NFC West-rival Rams in Week 6.\n\n10 BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENTS SO FAR:Jared Goff, Kirk Cousins floundering\n\nFOOTBALL FIX:NFL news delivered to your inbox\n\n\u2022 Potential flops: We thought they\u2019d be good this year, but \u2026\n\nFalcons \u2014 There\u2019s no bigger head-scratcher in this early stretch of the season. Despite boasting a full arsenal of weapons on offense and some pretty stout defenders, the Falcons have stumbled out to a 1-3 start. Matt Ryan is tied for the league lead in interceptions. Their run game is inconsistent, and their pass rush is feeble. Management locked up key players to handsome contracts, but so far, they\u2019re still waiting on a return on those investments. With the Saints seemingly unfazed by Brees\u2019 injury, Allen keeping the Panthers afloat and Jameis Winston displaying some growth under Bruce Arians, Atlanta could find itself in an inescapable hole very soon.\n\nVikings \u2014 Last season, they saw Kirk Cousins as the quarterback who would put them over the top. A year later, the Vikings have real problems. Adam Thielen is publicly undressing his quarterback for missing him on potential big plays while also calling out the coaching staff for a heavy run emphasis. Meanwhile, fellow wide receiver Stefon Diggs appears to be sending signals he wants out. The Vikings are 2-2, with those losses coming to divisional foes Green Bay and Chicago. Minnesota certainly has pounded the football, as Dalvin Cook is on pace for a 1,600-yard season. But Thielen has been targeted only 22 times through four games instead of the 54 he had at this time last year, and Diggs just 19 as opposed to 44. The reduced targets probably wouldn\u2019t be as frustrating if Cousins would capitalize when opportunities are available. Instead, he has lacked the effectiveness and aggression that the Vikings had hoped for in Year 2 of that three-year, $84 million deal. Now, that 2017 NFC Championship Game appearance with Case Keenum at the helm feels very far away.\n\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
