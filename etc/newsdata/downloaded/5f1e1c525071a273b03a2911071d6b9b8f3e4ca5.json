According to Assocham estimates, the Puja economy stands at Rs 1 lakh crore with varying degrees of spend on various segments of the Puja.\n\nSomewhere there is news of a Rs 4 crore idol and somewhere there is a Rs 20 crore pandal. Put together it looks like a humongous amount of money is spent within a fortnight on Goddess Durga to seek her blessings. Notwithstanding the fact that there is a huge amount of attachment as Bengalis from across the world converge in Kolkata and the remaining lot that constitutes a lot of non-Bengalis too celebrate it at their local place like singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya in Lokhandwala in Mumbai.\n\nThe recent news doing the rounds was that put per student education on an average of Rs 25,000 per annum in government schools with every state varying a little. Assuming that the belief in Durga Maa is so strong that all people worshipping her would listen to her and assuming that she is able to see that the female literacy rates of Uttar Pradesh is 42.2% and Bihar is 33.1% , and going a step further assuming that Durga maa communicates to her followers to cut down the expenses by half , the results for the girl child would be shocking .\n\nDurga Maa urging each devotee who could afford to spend Rs 25,000 per girl per annum to the extent that they can from the money saved. These blessings of Maa Durga can take care of the education and health of two crore girls in India which is close to one-fourth of the out of school numbers. If we look at girls in the 10-15 years ages where the maximum dropout happens, this 50,000 crore blessings of Durga Maa can change the whole landscape of girl child education.\n\nI am basing my fact on two assumptions:\n\nOne, Bengalis and Durga Maa devotees are very understanding of the need for empowering the girl child and women and could go to any extent since they understand the power of Durga Maa.\n\nSecond, a large number of Bengalis are in the field of education as teachers and are in a position to understand the need for education in the life and growth of the girl child.\n\nYes, to put this money in the hands of the government may raise questions in many minds hence the need to empower the girl child by paying for the education themselves in a school of their choice. The satisfaction of doing it themselves would also be greater.\n\nTo summarise, it will be in the hands of Durga Maa to empower the girl child on this International Day of the Girl Child.", "description": "As Durga Pujo comes to an end, the staggering figures of the lavish pandals, the innovative themes and the gigantic statues of Goddess Durga form the topic of gossip for a good fortnight.
