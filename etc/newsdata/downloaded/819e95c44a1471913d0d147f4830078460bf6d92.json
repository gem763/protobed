It\u2019s a broad and existential threat, but the more pressing issue is that I\u2019m having trouble self-motivating to start my next book. Procrastination isn\u2019t uncommon, especially among writers, but historically I\u2019ve overcome it through sheer force of guilt, anxiety, and ambition. This past year, though, something\u2019s changed. I still feel bad about my lack of productivity, but I feel less bad than I did before. Only the ghost of guilt remains, and the animating energy it used to give me has begun to dissipate somehow.\n\nI still feel bad about my lack of productivity, but I feel less bad than I did before.\n\nOn the one hand, this could be a good thing. I know it\u2019s not healthy to worry about work all the time. Experts on the topic dictate that happiness must be sought outside work; that no level of professional success or fame precludes dissatisfaction. There is \u2014 or should be \u2014 so much else that can fill one\u2019s life, outside professional ambition. But still, I worry: What if mine is gone, and doesn\u2019t come back?\n\nReassuringly, Jacques Forest, a psychologist and professor at Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, tells me that ambition is a self-sustaining resource (or it can be, at least). The question is not how much ambition I need, but what kind. \u201cThere are four different reasons why you want to work or do any activity: fun, meaning, ego, and reward,\u201d he says. When ambition is motivated by a desire for fun or meaning, our performance and well-being increase. But when we\u2019re primarily driven by ego and/or reward, our work suffers, and so do we. And when our work suffers, and fails to live up to the external, material expectations we set for it, it\u2019s pretty hard to want to keep doing it. We can\u2019t grow out of our ambition \u2014 Forest says he\u2019s found no real link between ambition and age or career \u2014 but we can make ourselves miserable in service of it, which may lead to its demise.\n\nWhen we\u2019re primarily driven by ego and/or reward, our work suffers, and so do we.\n\nWe can also just get tired. Some studies on willpower have suggested that after so many minutes/hours/days spent resisting whatever temptation we\u2019re trying to avoid (any of the seven deadly sins will do), we will grow fatigued and give in. Other studies have argued that we only run out of willpower if we buy the idea that willpower can run out. Maybe the truth is somewhere in between: Ambition can be depleted, but not permanently \u2014 unless you\u2019re chasing the wrong thing.\n\nMost people are motivated by all four forms of ambition, to varying degrees, Forest says. If I were to honestly examine the motivation behind every book I write, I know I\u2019d find the desire for fame, for credibility, for recognition, for money. There is also the love of the actual writing, the feeling I get when a good sentence is finished. And above all, there is the desire to connect, to tell stories I wish I\u2019d had access to when I was growing up. When I started writing, that dream of connection was all there was. The more success I\u2019ve found \u2014 and it\u2019s been pretty moderate \u2014 the harder it\u2019s gotten to prioritize connection above all else. Money and fame haven\u2019t exactly taken its place, but my objectives are now muddier, more complex.\n\nAccording to Forest, it\u2019s probably good that I haven\u2019t produced a huge hit yet \u2014 for my psyche, at least. \u201cThere is very good research showing that if you attain extrinsic goals, like financial success, fame, or popularity, it\u2019s actually like doing drugs: you need a bigger and bigger dose to get high,\u201d he says. \u201cAttaining those ambitious goals ruins your well-being.\u201d Put in non-academic terms: it pays not to sell out.\n\nBut still, I\u2019m struggling to motivate \u2014 so what do I do? According to self-determination theory, of which Forest is a proponent, all people have three innate needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. When we feel ourselves losing steam, it usually means that one or more of them aren\u2019t being met. Forest even calls those three innate needs \u201cvitamins,\u201d which I find helpful as a way to think about them regularly.\n\nUltimately, these needs aren\u2019t surprising: We are more motivated to work when we feel basically good at our jobs, when we feel that we have a say in what we do, and when we feel connected to other people around us. Of course, accomplishing these things in a work setting is easier said than done. And in the world we inhabit, it\u2019s impossible to ever really forget about money. Forest laughs when I ask him how we can reorient our ambitions to be less capitalistic.\n\n\u201cAmong my young students, their dream is, by 30, to get their Tesla car in the parking lot with a nice home and three trips per year,\u201d he says. \u201cI make them write down goals which are needs-satisfying, [so they\u2019ll think about] what they\u2019ll do on a daily basis to satisfy their psychological needs.\u201d At the risk of sounding like a mindfulness guru, much of Forest\u2019s advice amounts to practicing self-awareness and introspection: thinking about what really matters to you, and how to obtain it.\n\nIt\u2019s easier, for me at least, to think about my work and ambition in day-by-day metrics \u2014 in words written, in money earned. But with my more extrinsic ambition in hibernation, I\u2019m forced to revisit the bigger, fuzzier picture: what I need, and what I\u2019m doing about it. To be clear, I\u2019m still not sure how to go about this. I\u2019m just doing my best not to give myself a deadline, for once.\n\nStay in touch.
