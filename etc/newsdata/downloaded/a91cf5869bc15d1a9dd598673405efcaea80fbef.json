But even a decade later, her influence was still felt in the boutiques of Blackpool \u2013 simple lines, bright colours, lots of shift dresses, plus the round-collared blouse with the puffed sleeves that you always managed to trail into your shepherd\u2019s pie.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Sadly, I couldn\u2019t afford the iconic yellow tin of makeup crayons, so improvised unsuccessfully with my little brother\u2019s wax numbers. Yet I still remember solemnly painting my nails plum coloured with her varnish. And I still have a collection of teenage treasures tucked safely away in a battered Mary Quant foaming bath oil box.\n\nAnd now, the V&A Museum in London is hosting a look back in awe at Quant\u2019s world and work.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In fact, the secret of her success seems remarkably simple: she knew her style and she stuck to it, to the extent that she has barely changed her style since it was cut into the sharpest of bobs back in the 1950\u2019s.\n\nWhilst everyone else went poodle-perm mad or experimented with culturally inappropriate Bo Derek braids, Mary kept cool under her trademark heavy fringe.\n\nAll creatives crave longevity; it\u2019s all very well to burn bright and burn out, but what you really want is to live to see your own retrospective at one of the world\u2019s leading museums. At 85, Quant can safely say she has achieved the ultimate life goal: she has left a legacy. She has given us Twiggy in hot pants and coloured tights, and introduced the duvet to the UK.\n\nIf she now wants to do nothing else but lie back on the sofa in a stained Matalan onesie watching Homes under the Hammer, she has still won. She can let herself go, she can grow her hair long and grey if she wants. Her job is done.\n\nBut thanks to the V&A, she has also left us a little something extra, and it\u2019s free on the museum website. All you need is time, patience and a sewing machine.\n\nQuant\u2019s gift, as reinterpreted by the mother and daughter design team Alice and Co, is a free-to-download pattern based on one of her early best selling A-line shift dresses. This pattern has already been downloaded over 30,000 times by folk of all ages running up simple shift numbers and posting the results on social media, hashtagged #wewantquant.\n\nHow wonderful to be in your eighties and be able to look back at your career and know that during your lifetime, not only did you have a bus with your name on it, design the interior of a mini and put girls in properly waterproof PVC macs complete with matching boots, but that you\u2019ve also inspired tens of thousands of people to take to the sewing machine and actually create an iconic piece of fashion at the kitchen table.\n\nAmong my immediate circle of friends, only two can really sew (as in tackle anything more complicated than attaching a button). The rest of us got left behind in uninspiring domestic science lessons when an entire term could be wasted sewing an apron. If I\u2019d only been taught to make a skirt or a simple dress, I might have stuck at it \u2013 after all, you can\u2019t go to a disco in an apron, especially not when it\u2019s made in regulation school colours.\n\nSince then, my only brush with a sewing machine came via a celebrity craft challenge a few months back, when Rufus Hound and I competed to make a kaftan from scratch out of a square of fabric at Kirsty Allsopp\u2019s house. I can still feel the thrill of running a seam at full throttle, a sensation that weirdly reminded me of riding pillion on a Harley Davidson at 90mph.\n\nIn fact, come to think of it, if I really want to relive my youth, I\u2019m not going to do it by running up Mary Quant-inspired frocks at my kitchen table, oh no! If I\u2019m going to acquire yet another mid-life crisis hobby, sod the sewing machine. What I really want is a motorbike. It\u2019s my 60th in a few months, so excuse me while I go and do some browsing.", "description": "For so many of us, the name Mary\u00a0Quant immediately conjures up the daisy logo that appeared on all her Quant products and is still as fresh as a\u2026 of course, that was always the point.", "authors": ["Jenny Eclair"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/02/17/mary-quant-selecting-fabric-1967-c-rolls-presspopperfotogetty-images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
