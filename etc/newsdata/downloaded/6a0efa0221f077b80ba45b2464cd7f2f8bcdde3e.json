Lawmakers returned from their summer recess Tuesday for a pivotal day in British politics as they challenged Prime Minister Boris Johnson's insistence that the UK leave the European Union on 31 October, even without a withdrawal agreement to cushion the economic blow AP\n\nThe Musicians\u2019 Union is urging the government to \u201curgently review\u201d how it safeguards freelancers, in particular by broadening the Equality Act 2010.\n\nWorkplace culture was found to be the most significant obstacle to musicians informing their employers of harassment, according to 55 per cent of people responding to the survey.\n\nForty-one per cent feared losing work, while about one-third said they were concerned their allegations would not be believed or treated with sufficient gravity.\n\nOne woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said: \u201cI reported sexual harassment by a high-profile individual to a major employer in the industry. I understand I was one of 10 women making reports about the same individual and yet no action was taken as far as I\u2019m aware.\n\n\u201cWe are freelance musicians and the incidents occurred when we were performing on tour. I was told this was just 'lad culture' by the person investigating my complaint. No wonder such a high proportion of issues go unreported.\u201d\n\nThe Musicians\u2019 Union, which has launched a petition calling for more robust laws to shield freelancers from sexual harassment, asked the government to make it compulsory for employers to protect their staff from such mistreatment. It also argued for a statutory code of practice.\n\nNaomi Pohl, deputy general secretary of the union, said: \u201cWe are aware of far too many cases of talented musicians, particularly young or emerging artists, leaving the industry altogether due to sexism, sexual harassment or abuse.\n\n\u201cMany musicians who have gone public with their story are now being taken to court for defamation \u2013 evidence of the situation we\u2019re dealing with. Survivors are often unable to speak out because the consequences for their career or personal life are devastating. In most cases we are aware of, the survivor ends up leaving the workplace or the industry and there are very few consequences for the perpetrator.\u201d\n\nA US survey of 1,227 musicians carried out by the Music Industry Research Association last year found 72 per cent of female artists had been subjected to discrimination due to their gender. Two-thirds said they had been sexually harassed.\n\nRebecca Hitchen, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition campaign group, said: \u201cIt is overwhelmingly women musicians who experience sexual harassment and assault and who therefore face the backlash and repercussions if they do speak out or report. We find the increasing use of libel law as a way of silencing women who speak out about abuse, as experienced by the #SolidarityNotSilence campaign, extremely troubling.\n\n\u201cThe music industry is male-dominated, can be exploitative and has very few regulations. Much more needs to be done to both prevent harassment from taking place, and support those who speak out.\u201d\n\nDeeba Syed, senior legal officer at Rights of Women, added: \u201cThe law should be changed to include protections for freelancers so that they know someone will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nMichael Dugher, chief executive of lobbying group UK Music, said he welcomed the report and would discuss its findings with members. \u201cUK Music takes allegations of sexual harassment and abuse extremely seriously and promotes best practice across the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nA government Equalities Office spokesperson said: \u201cSexual harassment is appalling and it must be stopped. Our consultation on how the current laws can be improved closed at the beginning of this month, and we are carefully considering all of the responses we received. We proposed a number of measures to strengthen and clarify the law so that we can provide explicit protections to anyone who experiences this vile behaviour in the workplace.\u201d", "description": "About half of musicians have been forced to endure sexual harassment in the workplace, a new study has found. The Musicians\u2019 Union, which represents more than 30,000 musicians working across the industry, found some 85 per cent of victims did not report the harassment. Researchers said their silence was predominantly due to the \u201cculture of the industry\u201d.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/02/28/18/Sexual-harassment-iStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
