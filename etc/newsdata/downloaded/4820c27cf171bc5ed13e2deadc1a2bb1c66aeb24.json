Stay in one of these haunted hotels for Halloween", "language": "en", "text": "The poltergeist known as Lady Isabella has her own room at Ballygally Castle, where she died (Picture: Ballygally Castle)\n\nFor many people, the idea of staying over at a haunted hotel is a nightmare scenario, but then there are those who love historical horrors, mysteries and murderous stories of the past.\n\nDo you fit into the latter category and fancy a trip this coming Halloween?\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up seven of the most frightening hotels to stay at in the UK, guaranteed to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, courtesy of travel experts, eSky.\n\nJust don\u2019t blame us if you hear bloodcurdling screams in the night.\n\nMalmaison Oxford, England\n\nThis castle-turned-hotel has housed many vicious characters.\n\nIt was built by William the Conqueror \u2013 who had a pretty uneventful death \u2013 but the real story begins when it was transformed into a prison during the Victorian era, and held some of the UK\u2019s most feared criminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the original features still remain, including the dungeons \u2013 used for executions back in the day \u2013 along with the barred windows and the bare stone walls.\n\nBut the creepy characteristics of the venue are nothing compared to who you might encounter in the night: Mary Blandy, a murderer who poisoned her own father, along with monks and former prisoners.\n\nMary was hanged for her crimes and her spirit is said to remain in the hotel, where she haunts the visitors.\n\nLook our for poisionous vials.\n\nBallygally Castle, Northern Ireland\n\nIf you\u2019re a light sleeper, bring earplugs, because Lady Isabella likes to knock on doors and then vanish into thin air.\n\nWhen she was alive, the Lady was married to a cruel man known as Lord James Shaw. When she gave birth to their child, he took the baby from her and then locked her in a room at the top of the castle.\n\nAs for how she died, there are two theories; one claims that Lady Isabella fell from the tower window while trying to escape and the other, possibly more gruesome ending, says that Lord Shaw or one his men threw her from the window.\n\nDespite how she was treated in life, she\u2019s apparently a pretty nice spirit.\n\nShe\u2019s not the only ghost at Ballygally; Madame Nixon, who lived in the castle during the 19th century, also lurks in the shadows.\n\nThe ghosts have even taken over a small tower room in the hotel, which is so haunted that it\u2019s now closed off from guests and has been given the name \u2018The Ghost Room\u2019 or \u2018Lady Isabella\u2019s Bedroom\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuthin Castle, North Wales\n\nYou\u2019d never imagine that the picturesque Ruthin Castle, surrounded by greenery and the vast hills of Clwydian Range would be the location of a gruesome murder.\n\nHundreds of years ago, Lady Grey found out that her husband was cheating on her, and blinded by rage, she murdered his mistress.\n\nShe was sentenced to death, but didn\u2019t want to leave her castle and so has remained there ever since.\n\nLady Grey is the hotel\u2019s most famous poltergeist, though other sightings include a soldier with one glove and a little girl, according to Haunted Rooms.\n\nRuthin Castle is haunted by Lady Grey, a woman who murdered her husband\u2019s mistress (Picture: Getty)\n\nThe Shelbourne, Northern Ireland\n\nPerhaps Stephen King used the ghost of the Shelbourne as his inspiration for The Shining twins.\n\nMary Masters was just seven years old when she died in 1791, and apparently she can be heard giggling as she runs around the hotel at night.\n\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t follow the sound of her voice.\n\nThe Bell Inn, England\n\nParanormal activity is, er, the norm at The Bell Inn.\n\nA long time ago, an unsolved, mysterious murder took place when the hotel\u2019s landlady was pushed out of the window in room 10 and died.\n\nHer spirit still wants justice and so she has stuck around.\n\nGuests and team members at the hotel have also seen a hooded monk and heard children playing in empty rooms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Langham Hotel, England\n\nDo you dare to stay in room 333?\n\nIf you do, don\u2019t be surprised if you encounter a man from Victorian times, said to have committed a murder-suicide in the room and who refuses to leave.\n\nSleep well.\n\nDalhousie Castle, Scotland\n\nWe\u2019re not quite sure why female ghosts tend to be known as \u2018grey\u2019, but here\u2019s another one for you and it\u2019s a very sad story.\n\nDuring the 13th century, a 16-year-old girl now known as the Grey Lady, fell in love with a local stable boy.\n\nBecause he was an unsuitable choice, she was exiled to the castle\u2019s tower, where she died of a broken heart.\n\nLook up towards the castle when you arrive, she\u2019s known to wave to guests.\n\nMORE: Kids are dressing up as Boris Johnson for Halloween\n\nMORE: Mum comes up with brilliant headless ghost Halloween costume which cost nothing\n\nMORE: The top trending Halloween costumes for 2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "From Ballygally castle, Northern Ireland, where Madam Nixon knocks on doors to Chateau de Marcay in France, where you might spot a werewolf.", "authors": ["Almara Abgarian"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93269324_1572271477.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
