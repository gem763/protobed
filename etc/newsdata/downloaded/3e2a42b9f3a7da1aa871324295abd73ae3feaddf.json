She was 53.\n\nShe is survived by her mother, Soon Nam Kang; her husband, Jae Chyun; and her two children, Kyung and Jong.\n\nSue was a dedicated professional, colleague and friend. Born in Seoul, South Korea, she was raised by a diplomat father and a professor mother.\n\nDue to her father\u2019s job, the family led a globe-trotting life most of us could only dream of, making their home in cities such as Ankara, Turkey; Hokkaido, Japan; Houston; and Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nSue attended an all-girls Catholic high school in Texas and the University of California, Irvine, where she majored in English literature. At UC-Irvine, Sue won her first award: Her Korean barbecue took first place in the first-ever universitywide contest for original recipe.\n\nAfter her student visa ran out, she went back to Korea, \u201choping to make dabbling look cool,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, she married Jae Chyun, also from a Korean diplomatic family, and had Kyung and, two years later, Jong.\n\nOne day in Korea she by pure chance came across an ad looking for rookie reporters.\n\nHaving gotten a foot in the door, Sue went on to report on some of the biggest stories of our time, including the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the historic inter-Korea summit in 2000. She went on to become the first Korean to serve as bureau chief of a major U.S. media company in Seoul, working for Dow Jones Newswires in the early 2000s.\n\nA few years later, she found herself on another side of the Pacific, having joined the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, as a visiting scholar.\n\nAfter a brief stint at Berkeley, she joined MarketWatch in October 2007.\n\nOn the day she got her new-hire packet, Sue said she felt as if she\u2019d never left because she was assigned the same email address that she had when she worked for the wires \u2014 Dow Jones had bought MarketWatch a few years previously.\n\nSue would continue covering Earth-shaking news, such as the 2008 global financial crisis and the shift of global power dynamics with the emergence of China as an economic superpower.\n\nAt MarketWatch, she leaves numerous friends. Sue had been on a medical leave for the past few months.\n\nShe recently popped onto the office\u2019s chat app, and her colleague Myra Saefong asked if she had any messages to pass along.\n\n\u201cTell them I am OK and I miss everyone,\u201d Sue wrote.\n\nTypical Sue. She didn\u2019t want anyone to worry.\n\nSue was a hardworking reporter and editor, and her work, available online, speaks for itself.\n\nAt MarketWatch, she was always willing to lend an ear and give advice, as a mother of two grown children \u2014 and of two West Highland terrier \u201cfur babies.\u201d\n\nShe had large photos of the Westies displayed proudly at her desk.\n\nShe didn\u2019t have pictures of her children at her desk. Instead, she had a framed drawing of her family to showcase her daughter\u2019s art skills. When she shared an actual photo of her children following her son\u2019s college graduation in 2017, it was one of the few her co-workers had seen.\n\nMyra told her the kids looked great. \u201cAlmost as cute as my puppies!\u201d Sue said.\n\nBut Sue would always find subtle ways to show how extraordinarily proud she was of her family. One day Myra told her about how her then-toddler daughter, who was just learning about death, said she\u2019d miss her mom when she died.\n\nSue said: \u201cAw. Well, crap. I\u2019ll miss you too. So don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWe miss you too, Sue. And we wish you hadn\u2019t.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Sue\u2019s name to the Humane Society of the U.S.", "description": "Sue Chang, a longtime MarketWatch reporter and editor, died surrounded by family and friends in her home in California on Monday.
