The weed gummy Nerds Rope looks a lot like a regular Nerds Rope, right down to the nearly identical packaging, but it contains 400mg of THC, which regular Nerds Ropes do not. (The actual candy\u2019s manufacturer, Ferrara Candy Company, confirmed to CBS News that \u201cthis product is counterfeit.\u201d) I guess the cops are worried that some rando is gonna put these THC-filled Nerds Ropes in kids\u2019 candy bags on Halloween\u2014or, rather, they want parents to think that that\u2019s a real thing that could really happen, or else how would they justify keeping weed candy away from consenting adults and arresting the fine ladies and/or gentlemen and/or nonbinary individuals who sought to sell them to said consenting adults?\n\nLet\u2019s say that somehow, some way, some weirdo in your neighborhood decided to give your kids the weedy Nerds Rope. (Even though people aren\u2019t just, like\u2026 giving their drugs away because drugs cost money??) Let\u2019s say your kid eats in. Let\u2019s say\u2026your kid will probably be fine. Trust me. I speak from experience.\n\nI recently Got Too High after taking two honkin\u2019 bites out of a THC-filled Nerds Rope at a party without realizing it wasn\u2019t just regular candy and was, in fact, filled with THC. My friend told me \u201cNo!! Don\u2019t!!\u201d as I went in for bite number two, but I was kinda drunk and thought she was doing a bit! I ended up spending the rest of the night in a bed \u201clike a dog on ketamine,\u201d as one friend later put it, but you know what? I survived. And so will your kid. Eating weed might be scarier than smoking it, but it can\u2019t kill you\u2014even if you\u2019re underage.\n\nIf you want to protect your kids from THC-filled Nerds Ropes this Halloween\u2026literally keep doing what you\u2019re doing because there\u2019s literally no chance they\u2019re going to accidentally get their hands on one while they\u2019re out trick-or-treating. If they do happen to have a weed gummy Nerds Rope in their candy bags, it\u2019s because they intentionally bought one. In that case, why not be a good parent and explain how to responsibly consume an edible so they don\u2019t miss out on a fun night by getting too stoned? A tiny bite of a weedy Nerds Rope should be enough to get your kid high, according to this first-timer\u2019s guide to edibles, so please!
