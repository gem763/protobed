PRECIOUS-Gold edges higher on Brexit jitters, risk-on mood limits gains\n\n* Gold range-bound between $1,474-$1,510/oz - analyst\n\n* HK risks becoming new flashpoint in U.S.-China relations\n\n\n\n(Adds comments, details, updates prices)\n\nBy Eileen Soreng\n\nOct 16 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged higher on Wednesday\n\nafter shedding nearly 1% in the previous session, as some\n\noptimism about Britain's negotiations to leave the European\n\nUnion ebbed, while a risk-on sentiment capped the bullion's\n\ngains.\n\nSpot gold was up 0.2% at $1,484.10 per ounce as of\n\n0427 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCv1 were 0.3% higher at $1,487.90\n\nper ounce.\n\n\"There are some uncertainties since there is a lot to go\n\nthrough on Brexit. For instance even if both EU and UK\n\nnegotiators agree on terms it still has to go through the\n\nparliament,\" AxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes said.\n\nHowever, a signed Brexit deal could push yields higher,\n\nwhich fundamentally are significant headwinds over the near term\n\nfor gold, Innes added.\n\nMarkets are still awaiting the outcome of talks that dragged\n\non late into Tuesday night to see whether Britain and the EU can\n\ndraft an agreement on Brexit before a summit later this week. It\n\nalso remained unclear if London could avoid postponing its\n\nscheduled departure on Oct. 31.\n\nOfficials involved in negotiations said that differences\n\nover the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.\n\nHowever, Michel Barnier, EU negotiator, made it clear at a\n\nmeeting of the bloc's ministers in Luxembourg that if an\n\nagreement could not be reached on Tuesday, it would be too late\n\nto send anything for leaders to approve at the summit in\n\nBrussels on Thursday and Friday.\n\nGold also found some support from fresh U.S.-China strains\n\nover Hong Kong.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday passed four\n\npieces of legislation taking a hard line on China, three related\n\nto the protests in Hong Kong. Beijing opposed the new measures and urged lawmakers to stop\n\ninterfering.\n\nSo far the trade negotiations were going well between U.S.\n\nand China, but if we see a flip over this issue we might see\n\ngold moving up, Phillip Futures analyst Benjamin Lu said.\n\n\"Gold is still relatively range bound between $1,474 and\n\n$1,510.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Asian shares inched higher with MSCI's broadest\n\nindex of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up\n\n0.4%, while the dollar was slightly under pressure against a\n\nbasket of six major currencies. MKTS/GLOB USD/\n\nAmong other precious metals, palladium XPD= rose 0.2% to\n\n$1,736.56 an ounce, hovering near its record high of $1,739.93\n\nhit on Tuesday.\n\nSilver rose 0.4% higher to $17.44 per ounce and\n\nplatinum XPT= was down 0.3% at $886.15.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold edges higher on Brexit jitters, risk-on mood limits gains", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC4I11E_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
