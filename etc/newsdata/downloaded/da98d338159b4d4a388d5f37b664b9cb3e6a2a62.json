Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is promoting a new package of left-wing economic policies, including national rent control and expanding welfare to illegal immigrants across the country, as part of a massive new proposal aiming to achieve a \u201cjust society.\u201d\n\nThe freshman lawmaker, who champions the multi-trillion-dollar Green New Deal proposal to combat economic inequality and climate change, has now proposed a package of bills aimed at solving perceived economic injustice.\n\nOURBURST AT OCASIO-CORTEZ TOWN HALL WAS POLITICAL GROUP'S DOING, IT ADMITS\n\n\u201cA just society provides a living wage, safe working conditions, and healthcare. A just society acknowledges the value of immigrants to our communities. A just society guarantees safe, comfortable, and affordable housing,\u201d the website for the package says. \u201cBy strengthening our social and economic foundations, we are preparing ourselves to embark on the journey to save our planet by rebuilding our economy and cultivate a just society.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cJust Society\u201d proposals are made up of six different pieces of legislation that deal with issues including housing, welfare, poverty and human rights.\n\n\u201cThe Place to Prosper Act\u201d would prevent year-over-year rent increases of more than three percent. Meanwhile, \u201cThe Embrace Act\u201d would allow illegal immigrants to claim the same welfare benefits as U.S. citizens and those immigrants here legally,\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law ... an individual who is an alien (without regard to the immigration status of that alien) may not be denied any Federal public benefit solely on the basis of the individual\u2019s immigration status,\u201d the bill reads.\n\nA federal public benefit is defined as: \u201cany grant, contract, loan, professional license, or commercial license provided by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States; and...any retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, postsecondary education, food assistance, unemployment benefit, or any other similar benefit for which payments or assistance are provided to an individual, household, or family eligibility unit by an agency of the United States or by appropriated funds of the United States.\u201d\n\nA similar bill \u201cThe Mercy in Re-entry Act\u201d uses similar language to stop the granting of public benefits based on whether a person was convicted of a criminal offense.\n\nStill another bill, \"The Recognizing Poverty Act,\" would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to update the federal poverty level by taking into account \u201cgeographic cost variation, costs related to health insurance, work expenses for the family, child care needs, and new necessities, like internet access.\u201d Another bill would urge the U.S. to ratify the U.N.\u2019s Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n\nIt is unclear how such a radical package would go down in the Democrat-controlled House, while it would almost certainly be dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate. However, it could still prove to have a significant influence on U.S. politics.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal was initially treated as something of an oddity by both conservatives and some Democrats. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., dismissed it as the \"Green dream or whatever they call it.\"\n\nBut now a form of a Green New Deal is embraced by many 2020 Democrats on the campaign trail, although a test vote in the Senate on the measure failed during the summer. Other left-wing proposals such as \"Medicare-for-all\" and providing healthcare for illegal immigrants have also been adopted by some of those vying for the White House.\n\n\u201cI think the conversation that the Green New Deal sparked \u2014 like if I had to decide would I rather have the resolution passed or would I have rather preferred we start a national conversation about the urgency of the climate crisis \u2014 I would have chosen the latter every single time,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told NPR last month.", "description": "Rep.
