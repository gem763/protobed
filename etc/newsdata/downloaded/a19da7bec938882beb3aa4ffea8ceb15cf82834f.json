More than 1 million Egyptians began using a hashtag that translates as \u201cThat\u2019s enough el-Sissi\u201d to share a series of videos posted by the contractor from his self-imposed exile in Spain.\n\nEgyptians began hitting the streets Friday in defiance of a ban on protests. They did so again Sunday, and they plan to hold a \u201cmillion-man march\u201d later this week.\n\nGeneralized complaints about the state of civil liberties and human rights in Egypt have routinely gone nowhere under Mr. el-Sissi, but a specific tale of personal corruption appears to have hit a major nerve.\n\n\u201cCorruption of the army goes way beyond this spending on villas and has gone on for a very long time,\u201d said Ahmed Bahgat, 35, a human resources manager in Cairo, as police began to fire tear gas to disperse the protesters near Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 Arab Spring uprising in Egypt. \u201cBut since Mohammed Ali is just another [disgruntled] Egyptian created by a greedy state, people are responding.\u201d\n\nOn Friday night, hundreds of peaceful demonstrators took to the streets of downtown Cairo and the country\u2019s second-largest city, Alexandria, in the first real challenge to Mr. el-Sissi since he took over from Mohammed Morsi, who was removed from power in a 2013 coup. Those protests were followed by more on Sunday in the Nile Delta center of Mansoura and the industrial towns along the Suez Canal.\n\nOfficials told state-run media that police arrested scores of demonstrators. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms said Monday that it had documented the arrests of more than 400 demonstrators in 12 governorates.\n\nThe government was quick to blame the street protests on the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood despite the absence of Islamist rhetoric in the anti-government slogans and Mr. Ali\u2019s secular, debonair public persona.\n\n\u201cWe are familiar with their deception tactics and incitement to violence through fake news,\u201d said Gen. Yehia al Kidwany, a member of parliament who has called for Egypt to establish a nationalized alternative to Facebook. \u201cThese attempts come amid several projects to boost the state\u2019s infrastructure and aid low-income citizens.\u201d\n\nAlthough Cairo\u2019s streets were calm Tuesday, security personnel were visible, especially in the city\u2019s downtown.\n\nErosion of support\n\nAnalysts say the protests expose a nationwide erosion in Mr. el-Sissi\u2019s popularity, and not just among the poor.\n\nBefore the release of Mr. Ali\u2019s videos, the president had a reputation for being personally principled and uncorrupted, even as he centralized power and lavished public funds on purchases of expensive weapons systems and an ambitious infrastructure-building campaign.\n\n\u201cThe currency devaluation in 2016 pressured large segments of the working and middle class, but the case of Mohammed Ali shows disaffection among private entrepreneurs,\u201d said Ayman Hadhoud, economic adviser to Mohamed Anwar El-Sadat, chairman of Egypt\u2019s Social Democratic Reform and Development Party.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, there has been an expansion of contracts from the government and military institutions, and the other, private-sector businesses are seeing that the state is having difficulties in making payments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just the poor people who are upset, and el-Sissi\u2019s insistence on continued spending on palaces and futile projects gives the army an image problem among the general public,\u201d Mr. Hadhoud said.\n\nEgyptians grumble that their president has built nearly as many palaces for himself in the past four years as did longtime President Hosni Mubarak, Egypt\u2019s authoritarian leader of three decades before he was ousted in the 2011 uprising.\n\nThe government\u2019s figures show that 1 in 3 Egyptians is living in poverty, up from 16.7% in 2000, despite five years of austerity measures aimed at reforming the economy.\n\nMr. Ali has posted photos related to residential construction for Egypt\u2019s top leadership in tony new suburbs of Cairo and Alexandria, where he claims first lady Intisar el-Sissi requested roughly $1.5 million for renovations to a presidential villa.\n\nMr. el-Sissi felt compelled to address the charges himself at a Sept. 14 National Youth Conference, where officials advanced the theme of combating \u201cfake news\u201d spread via social media as a national objective alongside completion of the president\u2019s megaprojects.\n\n\u201cI am establishing a cultural and artistic city that will be the largest [city] in the world,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhat has been circulating on social media since the past two weeks aims at undermining the people\u2019s confidence in me. But to assure every Egyptian person, I say this [misleading and fake news] is a mere lie and a slander.\u201d\n\nMr. el-Sissi said new executive mansions were integral for the establishment of the New Administrative Capital he has ordered built in the desert 28 miles east of crowded, overburdened Cairo.\n\n\u201cYes, I am building presidential palaces,\u201d the president told conference attendees. \u201cThey are not mine. I am establishing a new state, and I am doing so in the name of Egypt.\u201d\n\nA day later, Mr. Ali released another video in which he said officers ordered him to perform a cleanup job at the cemetery where the president\u2019s mother is buried and erect a hotel in suburban Cairo conceived as a vehicle for private profit for a senior security official.\n\nIt ends with the call for street protests against Mr. el-Sissi\u2019s rule.\n\nSome say it\u2019s about time.\n\n\u201cThe regime does not realize that this is not just about Mohamed Ali and his videos,\u201d said Mohamed el-Tanawei, a 35-year-old demonstrator in Cairo on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s more related to people\u2019s economic conditions that worsen day by day.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Ali, Egypt\u2019s unlikely opposition leader, released a new video.\n\n\u201cEl-Sissi is now nervous because of the demonstrations, and I am sure he is now appealing to U.S. President Donald Trump to protect him from the next revolution,\u201d Mr. Ali quipped.\n\nBacked by Trump\n\nMr. el-Sissi did get a vote of confidence from Mr. Trump when the two met Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly gathering in New York. The U.S. president said he was \u201cnot worried at all\u201d by the reports of protests against Mr. el-Sissi.\n\n\u201cWhen [Mr. el-Sissi] took over not so long ago, [Egypt] was in turmoil. And it\u2019s not in turmoil now,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters after their meeting. \u201cEgypt has a great leader. He\u2019s highly respected. He\u2019s brought order.\u201d\n\nAmnesty International called Tuesday for authorities to release those detained in the recent protests and called for Mr. Trump and other world leaders to condemn the crackdown, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cThe world must not stand silently by as President el-Sissi tramples all over Egyptians\u2019 rights to peaceful protest and freedom of expression,\u201d said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International.\n\nBut Western diplomats in Cairo said Mr. el-Sissi\u2019s decision to go ahead with the New York visit this week showed the president was confident in continued army control of the streets as well as the state\u2019s ability to shut down and monitor much of the conversation in cyberspace.\n\nEgyptian authorities last week blocked the U.S. government\u2019s Arabic-language broadcaster and digital news portal Al-Hurra and added it to a list of 34,000 banned sites.\n\nBut some see a turning point in the willingness of Egyptians to take to the streets in public protests against the government.\n\n\u201cThe president admitted that he has been using public funds to build lavish palaces and vowed to continue doing so while 60% of the population are living under the poverty line,\u201d said Moustafa Khalil, a development scholar at Manchester University and a former monitoring and evaluation officer for USAID\u2019s Cairo office.\n\n\u201cIn a big country of 100 million people, you only need a small fraction to have the courage it takes to defy the regime\u2019s harsh restriction by taking to the street. If they survive on the street for a few hours, and they did, the ball starts rolling.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
