Chairman of the Women\u2019s Suffrage Commission and Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James released the following statement:\n\nWe commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first major step in adopting the 19th Amendment: the passage of the resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives. As the chairman of the Women\u2019s Suffrage Centennial Commission, I can attest to the fact that today\u2019s anniversary celebration, as well as the nationwide celebration in 2020 of the full ratification of the 19th Amendment, has truly been a bipartisan effort. I want to thank Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy for that effort.\n\nThis centennial celebration ensures that we don\u2019t forget the sacrifices, struggles, and the hard-fought victory to secure women\u2019s right to vote. The men and women who fought for that right did so because they believed the best way to change laws that treated women as second-class citizens was to have power over those who made the laws. I know that the leaders of the early women\u2019s movement would certainly be proud to know that today, the women\u2019s vote outnumbers that of men and that women are vigorously exercising the franchise that they fought so hard to secure.", "description": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 Today, the House of Representatives is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment.
