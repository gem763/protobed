The cost of the deal is unknown but will be a combo of cash and stock; it comes on the heels of Vox Media\u2019s acquisition of New York Magazine last week.\n\nThe deal seems to be driven by Vice\u2019s desire to expand readership by adding Refinery\u2019s female-skewing audience (Vice, founded in 1994 as a punk magazine, is best known for its aggressively edgy, bro-centric content). Refinery, meanwhile, focuses on fashion, beauty, and other content geared toward young women. Vice would also acquire Refinery\u2019s various revenue streams, which include advertising, content licensing, and events. The Journal notes that Refinery is also looking for audience expansion and that 60 percent of Vice\u2019s audience is outside of the U.S.\n\nBoth digital-media organizations have faced financial difficulties in the past several years. Refinery laid off 10 percent of its staff this time last year, and Vice has faced several rounds of layoffs in 2019, the first because of revenue slowdowns in February, and again recently when it merged its cable network, Viceland, and its news division. The merger and most recent layoffs followed the cancellation of its HBO show, Vice News Tonight, and the financial fallout that followed. Vice has long been hounded by cash-flow problems. According to a recent piece over at Intelligencer, \u201cSeveral senior employees had charges to their corporate credit cards inexplicably declined; one employee who left Vice this spring is still being hounded by debt collectors because Vice has not settled the roughly $3,000 left on a corporate card assigned to their name.\u201d\n\nWhile their content portfolios might indeed complement each other, when rumors of the deal first surfaced this summer, some critics expressed concerns about a culture clash. Vice has been accused of \u2014 and has apologized for \u2014 fostering a \u201cboys club\u201d culture, with one digital-media exec telling the New York Post that \u201cthe cultures are oil and water. Misogyny meets feminism.\u201d", "description": "Vice Media is in the final stages of talks to buy the female-focused digital-media company Refinery29.", "authors": ["Sangeeta Singh-Kurtz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/10/01/1-vice.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
