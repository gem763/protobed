There were 188 luxury units sold in Miami-Dade County in July, compared to 164 in July 2018, according to the MLS.\n\nIn the overall Miami-Dade market, single-family home sales rose 15% year-over-year in July, from 1,104 to 1,270, according to the Miami Association of Realtors.\n\n\u201cSellers have finally come to the party,\u201d Mr. Shuffield said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching sales soften since the latter part of 2015,\u201d and then prices began to weaken in 2016 and \u201cwe\u2019ve continued to see that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have more luxury buyers than ever, but they\u2019re not in a hurry,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to wait on the sidelines until they see what they want\u2014now they are beginning to strike and close on deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the activity has been from U.S. buyers from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California,\u201d said Danny Hertzberg of The Jills Zeder Group, affiliated with Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate.\n\nThere has been a complete shift from the \u201cinternational buyer to the domestic buyer,\u201d Mr. Hertzberg said.\n\nThe driving factor for domestic buyers is tax savings, but \u201csecondly, Miami is growing and becoming a truly international city, with more cultural offerings,\u201d he said.\n\nLuxury market inventory in Miami has been \u201cdecreasing somewhat, which is a good thing,\u201d Mr. Shuffield said.\n\n\u201cSixty-one percent of our inventory is condos right now, with single-family homes at 39%,\u201d he added.\n\nInterestingly, the number of sales is the reverse of that\u201461% of sales are single-family, with condos at 39%, Mr. Shuffield said.\n\nHe attributes this to the dip in the South Florida international market. \u201cMost international buyers through the years have purchased condos,\u201d he said.\n\nThe high end of the market, especially for single-family homes on the waterfront, \u201chas never been stronger,\u201d Mr. Hertzberg said.\n\nThe market for homes on the gate-guarded islands in Biscayne Bay, such as Star, Palm, and Hibiscus islands, is \u201cparticularly strong,\u201d he said.\n\nSummers are typically slow, \u201cyet we\u2019ve had multiple deals in the $10 million to $20 million range for single-family homes,\u201d Mr. Hertzberg said.\n\nThat augments well for a busy winter season, which typically runs from November to April or May, he said.\n\nBelow are a few projects that are launching sales this fall.", "description": "Boutique condos, waterfront homes are among the highlights of this fall\u2019s releases", "authors": ["Bill Cary"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-110307?size=1.8285714285714285&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
