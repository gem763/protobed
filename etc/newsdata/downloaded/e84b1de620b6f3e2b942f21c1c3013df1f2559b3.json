But some of these entrepreneurs launch despite naysayers saying: Don\u2019t do it!\n\nHere\u2019s the story of three second act entrepreneurs who ignored the critics because they were passionate about following their passions \u2014 \u201cdaydream businesses\u201d of book publishing and bed-and-breakfasts:\n\nFormer elementary school teacher Mary Taris, 55, of Minneapolis, who launched Strive Publishing, which creates picture books and young adult novels featuring stories from African-American communities. Her company\u2019s tagline: Breaking Barriers Book By Book.\n\nFormer public-school speech pathologist and civil engineer Heidi and Tom Notbohm, respectively, each 62, the founding innkeepers of Buckingham Inn Bed & Breakfast in Madison, Wis.\n\n4 lessons from follow-your-passion second act entrepreneurs\n\nTaris and the Notbohms took calculated risks, doing their basic business homework to lower their chance of failure. Four of their critical lessons that others can learn:\n\n1. Lower your downside risk. Taris took an online certificate course in entrepreneurship from North Central University in Minneapolis and tapped into resources from the Independent Book Publishers Association. She also started working on Strive Publishing on the side, starting in August, 2016 while still teaching in the Robbinsdale school system. She made the leap to full-time publisher after retiring from teaching in June, 2019.\n\nThe Notbohms developed a business plan for their B&B when they retired from their careers at age 55, in 2006. They knew the rule of thumb in the business: it takes at least seven rooms to make a living. Although their B&B had only three suites, the Buckingham is also their home \u2014 they live on the top floor. So, their reduced housing costs compensates for potential income. Also, Tom continues bring in income by working part time as a civil engineer, currently about 10 to 12 hours a week.\n\n2. Love your business. Taris, a divorced mother of four, worked for 15 years as a teacher and became disturbed how hard a time her African-American students had finding books that spoke to them. She used to say to herself, \u201cSomebody has to do something about this.\u201d Eventually, she realized, \u201cthat somebody is me,\u201d Taris says. So, she began publishing books part-time and thought: \u201cI have to turn this part-time business into my job.\u201d\n\nAlso on MarketWatch: 4 rewarding part-time jobs for retirees \u2014 that actually pay well\n\nThe Notbohms long enjoyed staying in B&Bs when traveling. For about 20 years, they had an ongoing conversation about how they\u2019d one day run a B&B. They took the leap in 2006 after seeing that a three-story building was for sale near the University of Wisconsin-Madison\u2019s stadium. They bought the Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced 1911 building and took it through a 14-month Arts-and-Craft style renovation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think either of us wanted to retire to relax. We wanted to retire to something else,\u201d says Tom. \u201cThis is an opportunity to be creative.\u201d\n\n3. Be entrenched in your community. Taris comes across so many people in her north Minneapolis neighborhood and nearby who want their story told. \u201cI am getting a sense that they need to tell their stories and the kids need to hear these stories,\u201d she says. Strive lets them do so.\n\nThe Notbohms clearly get a kick out of helping their guests learn inside stuff about Madison. They proudly work with local suppliers, too, such as makers of roasted coffee and cheese. \u201cWe like it, and the suppliers like it,\u201d says Heidi.\n\nRelated: How to start a nonprofit after you retire \u2014 from someone who did it\n\n4. Prepare for challenges and plan to change course when needed. Taris paid an advance to her three founding authors, but now realizes she doesn\u2019t have the financial resources to maintain the practice. She is contemplating other potential business models to keep her dream alive.\n\n\u201cIt has been a struggle to establish Strive, to figure out the business model,\u201d Taris says. \u201cI won\u2019t give up. I just feel that we can make a greater impact.\u201d\n\nAfter several years into their venture, the Notbohms clearly enjoy running the inn but have found the work to be physically demanding. It\u2019s taking a slightly larger toll on them than when they started.\n\nAlso read: The positives \u2014 and surprising negatives \u2014 of an encore career\n\nThey\u2019re thinking about hiring someone to help out in the future or accepting taking in less business.
