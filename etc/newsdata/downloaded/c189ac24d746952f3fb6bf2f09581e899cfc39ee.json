Among them was the interior minister, a powerful position responsible for domestic security.\n\nDespite the sanctions move and tough rhetoric from administration officials, Trump continued to defend his decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria even though he was warned in advance that it would result in the mayhem occurring now.\n\n\u201cAfter defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals, why should we be fighting for Syria and Assad to protect the land of our enemy?\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \u201cAnyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Trump-Says-He-Will-Soon-Issue-Order-Authorizing-Sanctions-On-Turkey-Over-Its-Incursion-Into-Syria"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
