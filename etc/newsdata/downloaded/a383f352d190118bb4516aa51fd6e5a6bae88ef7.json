Critics say he has risked the lives of Syrian Kurdish allies who helped bring down the Islamic State group in Syria.\n\nTrump defends the move as fulfilling a campaign promise to bring home U.S. troops.\n\n___\n\n1:15 p.m.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials say more than 700 Islamic State supporters have escaped from a camp for displaced people in northeastern Syria as Turkish forces advance on the area.\n\nThe Kurdish-led administration said detainees attacked Ain Eissa camp\u2019s gates and fled Sunday amid intense fighting nearby and Turkish airstrikes.\n\nThe camp is home to some 12,000 people, including nearly 1,000 foreign women with links to IS and their children.\n\nThe town of Ain Eissa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the border, is also home to one of the largest U.S.-led coalition bases in northeastern Syria.\n\nThe Kurdish forces, who partnered with the U.S. in the fight against IS, say they may not be able to maintain detention facilities holding thousands of militants as they struggle to stem the Turkish advance.\n\n___\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nThe United Nations says at least 130,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in northeastern Syria with many more likely on the move as a Turkish offensive in the area enters its fifth day.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Kurdish-led administration warned Sunday of a \u201chumanitarian disaster\u201d as aid and service delivery to northern Syria is hampered by the fighting. The fighting has reached the main highway that runs between Hassakeh, a major town and logistical hub, and Ain Eissa, the administrative center of the Kurdish-led areas.\n\nThe UN said its technical teams have not been able to access a water pumping station in Hassakeh town damaged from shelling, leaving 400,000 people, including 82,000 residents of displaced camps affected by the suspension of water.\n\nAirstrikes, artillery shells and intense clashes have reached as far as 30 kilometers (19 miles) south of the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n___\n\n12:05 p.m.\n\nSyrian Kurdish officials say Islamic-State supporters have escaped from a camp for displaced people in northeastern Syria after shells landed nearby.\n\nTurkish forces have been advancing toward the town of Ain Eissa, some 35 kilometers (20 miles) south of the border, as part of their offensive against Kurdish-led forces. The town is home to a camp housing some 12,000 people, including nearly 1,000 foreign women with links to IS and their children. The administrative hub is also home to a U.S.-led coalition base.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says Turkish warplanes struck villages near Ain Eissa camp on Sunday. It says some camp residents fled as intense clashes broke out between Turkey-backed Syrian fighters and Kurdish forces.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many camp residents escaped.
