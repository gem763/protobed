We did that for two weeks.\n\n\"It was me, her dad, her two Nannas and my dad would sit by her to make sure she was okay.\n\n\"He would do the night shift. She had all her family around her in the last couple of weeks.\"\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers)\n\nShe added that before her daughter passed away, she was up and down for a couple of days.\n\nShe said: \"She couldn't manage the pain, she had an episode the night before.\n\n\"We picked her up and gave her a bath, we laid her back down and she started choking.\n\n\"The nurse saw her at 12:30 at night. She told us that its not long now until she will pass as her heart was over 160 beats a minute.\n\n\"She texted me at 9am the next day to see if everything is okay 'yeah she is still with us', I said.\n\n\"I had a text off Angela the nurse at 15:02 to say that the GP will be calling out this afternoon to see Demi. Then at 15:03 Demi took her last breath.\"\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers)\n\nHer parents revealed that Demi had been full of life and always had a smile on her face, particularly when she played pranks which she had loved to do.\n\nDemi's mum added that they had tried to ensure her daughter had nothing to worry about in her last few weeks.\n\nMs Evans-James said: \"Demi knew she was unwell but we didn't want her to know or have that worry. I generally don't think that she knew what was happening.\n\n\"The first two weeks we had visitors here every other day, now its quiet. Everything was loud with her here.\n\n\"In a way you start grieving when she first had the diagnosis. I struggled a lot through that.\n\n\"I still don't think it has hit me completely. I try to keep myself busy otherwise you just sit and think. Life was full before but now its empty.\n\n\"It's getting harder as time goes on. You feel like you are stuck in repeat. We will all miss her more than words can say.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers)\n\n\"For me it feels like when she would go away with her dad for a week and that week is getting longer and she isn't coming back.\n\n\"She's the only grandchild on both sides. An adult Christmas is nothing. Christmas was about Demi.\n\n\"There needs to be more awareness of children cancer. There have been no new drugs for children cancer in years.\"\n\nMr Wilson said that the last few weeks have been a blue.\n\nHe said: \"Because we stayed positive, she was doing well and it helped us do well if that makes sense.\n\n\"For me, the grieving process is harder now than when she passed away as we were so busy planning the funeral at the start.\n\n\"I don't think you will ever stop grieving. Demi has touched so many hearts.\n\n\"In the short life she had she done more than children have done all their life.\n\n(Image: Jonathan Myers)\n\n\"You wouldn't wish this on your worst enemy. It's not so much what we had to go through its what she had to go through.\n\n\"She was in so much pain and she wasn't Demi at the end.\n\n\"You think a child with cancer is rare but its really not. If you are not in the bubble then you think its a myth, you think cancer is when you are old but its not like that at all.\"\n\nDemi would have turned seven on October 12 and to commemorate the occasion her family released balloons in her memory.\n\nThey are also collecting donations for Kids Cancer Charity who supported Demi through her journey.", "description": "Demi Wilson, from Swansea in Wales, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer aged three and sadly despite an all-clear diagnosis two years ago she lost her fight for lifen and the disease returned", "authors": ["Katie Bellis", "Kaisha Langton", "Image", "Jonathan Myers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569967.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JMP_SWA_071019Demi_Wilson_021JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
