They voiced exasperation at the expectation that they defend the president against the troublesome picture that has been painted, with neither convincing arguments from the White House nor confidence that something worse won\u2019t soon be discovered.\n\n\u201cIt feels like a horror movie,\u201d said one veteran Republican senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the consensus.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s strategy is being directed almost entirely by the frenzied impulses of Trump, who has exhibited fits of rage over the Democrats\u2019 drive to remove him from office for abuse of power.\n\n\u201cI did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday. \u201cThis is a takedown of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has been a loud dissenter, he has been speaking for himself as opposed to acting as a frontman for some silent caucus of like-minded Republicans, according to people familiar with the dynamic. Most GOP senators have been taking cues from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), whose paramount concern has been maintaining his party\u2019s control of the chamber in next year\u2019s election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re going to take it all grudgingly \u2014 and privately, perhaps, in disgust \u2014 but they\u2019re not going to give up the farm,\u201d said Al Cardenas, former chairman of the American Conservative Union. But, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s been piling on, piling on, piling on, and I see defense fatigue on behalf of the Republicans in the Congress.\u201d\n\nTrump and his allies have strained to focus the debate on the process, but Republican officials have struggled to answer for the substance of the startling statements made by the growing list of credible witnesses from the national security and diplomatic realms.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s frustration. It feels to everyone like they\u2019re just digging a hole and making it worse. It just never ends. . . . It\u2019s a total [expletive] show,\u201d said one Republican strategist who has been advising a number of top senators and who, like several others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nMcConnell, who has shared related concerns in private conversations with other senators, has been preparing for a possible Senate impeachment trial. And earlier this month he showed a dry PowerPoint presentation to Republican senators explaining how one might unfold.\n\nMcConnell remains engaged with Trump but has a mixed view of the president\u2019s advisers, several Republicans said, noting that he misses his productive working relationship with former White House counsel Donald McGahn and is \u201cless enamored\u201d with his successor, Pat Cipollone, according to a McConnell ally. A Senate GOP aide said McConnell and Cipollone have a good working relationship.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs they went about their work at the Capitol this past week, many Senate Republicans were all but mute when reporters asked questions about impeachment \u2014 a stark snapshot of a party rattled not only by the House inquiry but also by Trump\u2019s removal of U.S. troops from northern Syria; his decision, later retracted, to host next year\u2019s Group of Seven summit at his Florida golf resort; and his claim that the investigation into him amounted to a \u201clynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a juror and I\u2019m comfortable not speaking,\u201d Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) said. Pressed again for comment, he reiterated, \u201cI said I\u2019m comfortable not speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be a juror, so I have no comment,\u201d Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a strategy for impeachment because I may be a juror someday,\u201d Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said.\n\nAD\n\nEven as they withheld judgment of Trump\u2019s conduct, Republican senators were quick to try to exploit vulnerabilities in the process being run by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t follow any of it because that\u2019s not due process,\u201d Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) said. \u201cSecret hearings, selective leaks. And that\u2019s due process? In my America, that\u2019s not due process.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans, the political conundrum is a problem of their own making, argued William A. Galston, a senior fellow in governance at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey normalized a president whose conduct they are now being asked to judge as so abnormal as to warrant his removal from office,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTo the extent that they quietly harbor conscientious objections to what the president is doing \u2014 or, even more spectacularly, how he\u2019s doing it \u2014 they have to weigh the calling of conscience against political considerations,\u201d Galston added. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why \u2018Profiles in Courage\u2019 is a very short book. Courage is not the norm. It\u2019s the exception.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump was buoyed last week by a resolution introduced by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) condemning the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry as \u201cillegitimate.\u201d But eight Republican senators did not initially sign onto what Graham conceived of as a show of support for the president; five of them later did, leaving only Romney and Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska as the holdouts.\n\nTrump was given another lift in Republican enthusiasm Sunday when he announced that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the elusive Islamic State leader, died during an American military operation in Syria. Top Republicans hailed the news as a significant victory in the fight against terrorism and praised Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAt the White House last week, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway chided the media for what she characterized as a rush to judgment about Trump\u2019s conduct. \u201cLet\u2019s take a deep breath and stop pretending we know what\u2019s in somebody else\u2019s heart, mind or soul, and just wait to see where the facts take us,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nTrump had lunch last Thursday with, among others, Alexander, who is retiring next year and is widely seen by his colleagues as driven by his personal integrity and therefore liable to vote against Trump if the case for his removal is strong, according to several lawmakers and GOP aides. Others in the camp of possible Republican breakaways \u2014 including Collins and Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) \u2014 have not engaged much with Trump or his advisers on impeachment, lawmakers and aides said.\n\nRepublicans have been grousing in private about the lack of a clear strategy at the White House and their limited grasp of the full set of facts and how officials are prepared to explain them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s causing the most pause is, what else is out there? What is around the corner?\u201d said a second Republican strategist in regular contact with congressional leaders. \u201cIf they say something in defense of the president or against the impeachment inquiry now, will they be pouring cement around their ankles?\u201d\n\nWhite House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, a former House member, has been a constant target of behind-the-scenes ire from GOP lawmakers. Talk about potential replacements for Mulvaney has become a parlor game on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have noted his inability to constrain Trump or build a political and messaging operation dedicated to countering the impeachment inquiry.\n\nRep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a conservative hard-liner, has been a fixture at the White House, talking to Trump \u201cmore than Mulvaney,\u201d in the estimation of one Trump adviser who was not authorized to speak publicly. \u201cEvery time you look over toward the Oval, there is Mark Meadows,\u201d this adviser said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThere are some signs that the White House is moving to do more to deal with the fraying among congressional Republicans, with Trump reaching out to more members by phone and discussions about bringing in a high-profile lawyer to deal directly with impeachment, as well as new communication aides.\n\nThe usual chorus of support for Trump from conservative media figures remains active but scattered. Former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon has launched a podcast that he calls an outside \u201cwar room\u201d for the president, broadcasting from the basement of his home on Capitol Hill. Meadows appeared on Bannon\u2019s program last week, calling out House Democrats for \u201cinformation warfare\u201d and said it is \u201cimperative that our team\u201d counters with \u201creal facts.\u201d\n\nBut in the biggest blow yet to Trump, acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine William B. Taylor Jr. testified last week that the president had personally intervened in a quid pro quo for U.S. military aid to be contingent upon Ukrainian investigations into Democrats. Some Republicans have tried to dismiss his account, arguing it is based on secondhand information, but many lawmakers have found it hard to defend Trump in the wake of that testimony.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe picture coming out of it based on the reporting we\u2019ve seen I would say is not a good one, but I would say also, until we have a process that allows for everybody to see this in full transparency, it\u2019s pretty hard to draw any hard-and-fast conclusions,\u201d Sen. John Thune (S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters.\n\nSen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), another member of leadership, said, \u201cTo some extent, we need to be thoughtful about waiting for the House and whatever conclusions they reach. For us to express concerns about process is totally appropriate. But reaching conclusions based on anybody\u2019s select information at this point probably isn\u2019t a helpful place for us to be.\u201d\n\nThe GOP majority is in play in 2020, with Collins, Joni Ernst (Iowa), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Martha McSally (Ariz.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.) each facing tough campaigns and grappling with polls in their states showing independent voters souring on Trump and open to impeachment.\n\n\u201cAt some point, McConnell is going to have to perform triage to save the majority,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a longtime GOP consultant and Trump critic. \u201cHow the Senate Republicans handle everything is all going to come down to how threatened Mitch feels and how worried he is about losing Colorado, North Carolina and a few others states. And if Trump\u2019s numbers keep dropping, that decision is going to come sooner than later for him.\u201d\n\nFor now, Trump\u2019s near-absolute control over his party\u2019s base makes it difficult for Republicans to do anything but cheer him or be uneasy in the shadows, even though polls show that a majority of Americans disapprove of his job performance.", "description": "As the impeachment inquiry enters its second month, Senate Republicans are frustrated with the absence of a credible defense of President Trump and nervous about the historic reckoning that lies ahead.", "authors": ["Robert Costa", "National Political Reporter Covering The White House", "Congress", "Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/clSc6FvPDpV-FXTOHZbmjKj5rQo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2BCCBJHVBEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
