But that didn\u2019t stop The Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah from donning a judge\u2019s wig and holding a trial for his impeachment Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the impeachment trial of Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney to the president and courageous rabies survivor,\u201d Noah said after banging his gavel. He began with the whistleblower complaint against the president, which names Giuliani as a \u201ccentral figure\u201d in the Ukraine scandal.\n\n\u201cYes, it appears Rudy Giuliani was the anus of this entire operation,\u201d Noah declared. \u201cEverything passed through him and it stinks to high heaven.\u201d The host joked that if you \u201cControl-F\u201d Giuliani\u2019s name in the report, the screen will \u201clight up like a motel bed under a black light.\u201d\n\nFrom there, he indicted Giuliani for incriminating his client \u201cby saying far too much on TV,\u201d most notably in his completely insane interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo last week. \u201cIt appears Giuliani was outsmarted by Chris Cuomo,\u201d Noah said, \u201cwhich in and of itself is a crime!\u201d\n\nAnd finally, Noah brought up the \u201cmost damning\u201d charge of all: \u201cbeing one crazy-ass motherfucker.\u201d After playing a montage of his greatest hits from Fox News over the past few days, Noah said, \u201cClearly this man is out of control. I mean, it says a lot when you are the most unhinged person on Fox News.\u201d\n\nDelivering his verdict, Noah said, \u201cOn the charge of interfering in foreign affairs, acting as the president\u2019s personal thug and just being an overall hot mess in breach of the Hot Mess Act of 1834, this court finds you, Rudolph William Dracula Giuliani, guilty!\u201d", "description": "\u201cYes, it appears Rudy Giuliani was the anus of this entire operation,\u201d Noah declared. \u201cEverything passed through him and it stinks to high heaven.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1418,w_2520,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569988211/TN_56_xfcbpb"}
