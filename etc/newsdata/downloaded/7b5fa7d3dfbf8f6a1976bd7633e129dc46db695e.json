Auto makers, which report their August sales on Wednesday, account for some of the slowdown. General Motors has ceased production this year at a car plant in Ohio and transmission factory in Michigan, two of the four US sites that it has said aren't being allocated future product. Other auto makers are reducing production shifts, including Nissan, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Honda.\n\nWeakness in the automotive and electronics markets is also impacting 3M's bottom line. Sales and profit at the diversified manufacturer fell in the second quarter even as earnings topped expectations. At Caterpillar, a slowdown in crude extraction from the Permian Basin, the largest US oil patch, is reducing demand for machinery. What's more, the equipment maker's worldwide machine sales in June and July were up 4 per cent, the slowest in two years.\n\nManufacturing is technically already in a recession in the US with a Fed measure of output declining in two consecutive quarters. The malaise is consistent with developments in the sector around the world. By one measure, global factory activity has contracted for four straight months.\n\nThe ISM's measure of new orders, which are tracked by some as a leading indicator of a downturn, declined to 47.2. It was the first time since December 2015 that the gauge fell below 50. ISM's production gauge also sank below that mark, to 49.5 in August from 50.8.\n\nThe slump in demand and output spilled over into the labour market as the ISM's gauge of factory employment fell to 47.4, the lowest level since March 2016. That suggests this Friday's employment report will show weakness in August manufacturing payrolls, which were surprisingly solid the previous two months.\n\n\"It confirms that the weakness that we've been seeing for a number of months now on the global front and on the tariff front is really washing up to the US shores,\" said Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. \"What's important here is that it's not just the current conditions that have deteriorated quite sharply but also the forward-looking components.\"\n\nA measure of export orders, a proxy of overseas demand, sank to 43.3, the lowest reading since April 2009 during the depths of the last recession.\n\nA separate factory PMI from IHS Markit came in at 50.3 on Tuesday, showing manufacturing was barely expanding. Economists and investors tend to more closely follow the ISM report, which dates to 1931.\n\nThe \"shock effect\" of the latest ISM report \"adds to recession fears, and the components were also pretty weak,\" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, in an interview. \"This does confirm that we're not bottoming out yet in manufacturing in this country, and that's significant.\"\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index fell to 49.1 in August, weaker than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3681%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f88a83fe924c66a755dfce380cdfe42de988688e", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
