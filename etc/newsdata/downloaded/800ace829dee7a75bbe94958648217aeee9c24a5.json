Astros players in the dugout were seen distraught and with their hands on their heads in concern.\n\nBrantley was clearly shaken from the incident and Astros manager A.J. Hinch came out of the dugout to him during the delay.\n\nHe ended up reaching first base after a wild pitch by Adam Ottavino on a missed swinging third strike.\n\nA security guard is tended to in the Astros dugout after being hit by a foul ball.

An Astros spokesman said the club did not have any details or an update on the man's condition.\n\nThe Astros extended the protective netting to the stands earlier this year. The benches are protected with a fence, but it's easy for balls to get over and go into the dugout.\n\nThis Brantley foul ball hits a member in of the Astros support staff.
