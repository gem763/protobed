It grossed US$155 million in the first weekend of its release, the highest opening figure in U.S. box office history. In just three days, the film retrieved most of its production cost of $180 million.\n\nThe film opened in Korea on Aug. 6, and has since remained at the top of the local box office. Koreans in 2008 are quite familiar with the term \"superhero,\" even those who are not enthusiastic moviegoers. The Chosun Ilbo has tallied the top 10 superhero films.
