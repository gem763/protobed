A mantra that has now ingrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head,\" wrote Markle.\n\n\"That five pounds lost won't make you happier, that more makeup won't make you prettier, that the now iconic saying from 'Jerry Maguire' - 'You complete me' - frankly, isn't true. You are complete with or without a partner. You are enough just as you are.\"\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex has filed to renew the trademark for The Tig, a website she ran before marrying Prince Harry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9366/639739bf5afc4736903cd61e019cb70c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
