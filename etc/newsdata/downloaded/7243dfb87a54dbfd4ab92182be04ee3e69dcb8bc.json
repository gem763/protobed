Jashika said she was now looking forward to starting her gymnastics career.\n\nThe kids are currently in the enrollment process, submitting paperwork and medical records, according to Reshma Khatoon, Jashika's mother. If approved, they will be able to formally start training with the Sports Authority of India.\n\n\"I am a huge fan of Nadia Comaneci and I want to meet her and be like her,\" Jashika said. \"I want to go to the Olympics one day and make my country proud.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Thursday, Comaneci said that she was surprised that her tweet went viral but said that she is happy the Sports Authority of India has stepped up to help the two children.\n\n\"I thought the video was so cool and spontaneous -- two kids going to school with their backpacks and then they throw in a couple of gymnastics skills,\" Comaneci said. \"I just want to wish them good luck, enjoy what they do and be happy, and I hope I get to meet them at some point.\"\n\nI'm happy that @nadiacomaneci10 tweeted it! As first gymnast who scored perfect 10.0 at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, and then, received six more perfect 10s to win three gold medals, it becomes very special. I've urged to introduce these kids to me. https://t.co/ahYVws8VCB \u2014 Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) August 30, 2019\n\nRao, the children's dance coach, told ABC News on Thursday that he felt there was something special about Jashika and Mohammad from the moment he started giving them dance lessons four years ago.\n\n\"I knew from the beginning that these kids were very talented,\" Rao told ABC News. \"Something that would take anyone else a week to learn, they could learn in an hour.\"\n\nKhatoon told ABC News that her family has always struggled to put food on the table and that the family often was unable to buy school supplies for Jashika and her two siblings. But now, she said, she is happy that the viral video has given her daughter an opportunity to follow her dreams.\n\n\"From a young age, she would jump over walls whenever she saw one, but I never realized that it would lead to something like this,\" Khatoon said. \"I can't put into words how proud I am of her. I hope her story inspires other children to follow their passions.\"\n\nRao said that he hopes the other students in his dance academy will also get more support as a result of Jashika and Mohammad's story going viral. Currently, the children practice on a hard surface and he wants to be able to provide mats for them in the future.\n\n\"I am very happy for these two kids, but there are lots of slum children who are talented but their stories are not heard,\" Rao said. \"I hope more people will pay attention now.\"\n\nAlthough social media did not exist when Comaneci started her gymnastics career in Romania, it was also her doing cartwheels in school that caught the attention of gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi.\n\n\"I was doing some cartwheels in kindergarten when Bela came to ask all the kids if they could do cartwheels,\" Comaneci said. \"So it started with a cartwheel for me, too. You never know where a cartwheel can take you.\"\n\nComaneci told ABC News that she is glad she could make a difference for the kids by sharing the video on social media.\n\n\"I think that every kid should have an opportunity to play sports, and there are a lot of kids who don\u2019t have those opportunities because they come from a difficult background or they cannot afford to do that,\" Comaneci said. \"If I can change the life of someone, using sports or social media, I think that\u2019s amazing.\"", "description": "The video, which captured Jashika Khan,11 and Mohammad Azajuddin,12, was recorded by their dance coach, Shekhar Rao, founder of Eternities Dance Academy in Kolkata.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/nadia-comaneci-gty-jt-190916_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
