Police say they 'provide better video' than bodycams", "language": "en", "text": "HIAWATHA, Iowa -- As many Americans watched in horror as protests broke out in Ferguson, Mo., after the Michael Brown police shooting, Brian Hedeen felt compelled to find a solution.\n\nPeople, he said, were unclear why the officer pulled the trigger and killed Brown -- leading to weeks of unrest. That uncertainly led him to start a company that would give the public some clarity. His business, Viridian Weapon Technologies in Minneapolis, Minn. is one of two companies offering technology that places a camera on a police officer's gun -- rather than the body.\n\nHedeen, and other proponents of the new technology, say gun-mounted cameras offer a better view of a police shooting and are more precise than body-worn cameras.\n\n\u201cBody-worn cameras are really good, but there are some limitations,\u201d said Hiawatha Police Chief Dennis Marks, which recently began using gun-mounted cameras in his department. \u201cThere are different places that the officers wear the cameras and the problem with that is during a critical incident when a weapon is involved, your weapon potentially is going to be blocking that.\u201d\n\nBut the technology -- now being used in police departments in Minnesota, Texas, Florida and Iowa -- has come scrutiny by civil libertarians who worry that because they are less expensive, they could eventually replace body cameras, which capture a fuller picture. The gun cameras cost about $500, at least 5 to 10 percent cheaper than traditional body cams.\n\nUnlike a bodycam, which officers need to turn on manually, gun cameras begin rolling as soon as officers pull their service weapons from their holsters. So it does not capture the footage leading up to the shooting -- but does provide an unobstructed view. Most police departments using the technology are pairing it with the bodycams.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal for us is to have an unbiased video of a critical incident,\u201d Marks said.\n\nMACHETE-WIELDING CALIFORNIA MAN SHOT, KILLED BY DEPUTIES\n\nHedeen said the gun cams are practical and affordable for cash-strapped police departments.\n\n\u201cBodycams end up costing a lot of money due to all the data that's generated needs to be stored as well as processed. Departments usually need to hire staff to manage this,\u201d Hedeen said. \u201cOur product is a fraction of the data because it's only recording when the gun is out of the holster so, it's very easy for them [police departments] to implement and manage.\u201d\n\nBut that is exactly what has drawn concerns.\n\n\u201cGun cameras should not be a replacement for body cameras,\u201d said Kyle Middlebrooks, president of the NAACP chapter in Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cIf we\u2019re using just that as the information to solve an entire case, you\u2019re missing everything that led up to that incident.\u201d\n\nSupporters of bodycams said they hold police officers accountable and have prompted many officers to change their behavior when they interact with the public. Hedeen said he believes gun cameras could be another tool for law enforcement.\n\nFor Marks, the Hiawatha police chief, he believes the gun cameras will serve as a critical piece in use-of-force incidents.\n\n\u201cI think this is the last step, you know, your last opportunity to get out in front and get the video that you\u2019re looking for,\" he said. \"I do believe this is the last piece of the puzzle.\u201d", "description": "A growing number of police departments are considering video technology, saying that gun cameras would offer better footage than body cameras.", "authors": ["Mitti Hicks", "Mitti Hicks Joined Fox News In As A Multimedia Reporter Based In Des Moines"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Clip0015T01.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
