Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe cover story New York published this week centers on the stories of women and men who came forward about sexual abuse and harassment \u2014 and one who has not yet done so. In the issue, a woman who says former U.S. senator Al Franken groped her buttocks at an event in 2006 explains why she\u2019s kept silent until now, and why she still fears using her name.\n\n\u201cI was just out of college in my first job, working for U.S. Senator Patty Murray,\u201d she told New York. Franken, then exploring a run for the Senate, was the guest speaker at Murray\u2019s annual Golden Tennis Shoes Awards (named for a dismissive description of Murray, early in her political career, as a mom in tennis shoes).\n\nThe woman worked the photo line, and when it was her turn to be photographed with Franken, she said, \u201cHe puts his hand on my ass. He\u2019s telling the photographer, \u2018Take another one. I think I blinked. Take another one.\u2019 And I\u2019m just frozen. It\u2019s so violating. And then he gives me a little squeeze on my buttock, and I am bright red. I don\u2019t say anything at the time, but I felt deeply, deeply uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nA military veteran who is now a senior staffer at a major progressive organization, she is the ninth woman to accuse Franken of inappropriate conduct, and the fourth to say Franken grabbed her butt. New York also spoke to three individuals in whom she had confided after the first Franken accusations emerged; she says she does not recall telling anyone about the incident at the time out of embarrassment.\n\nFranken, who resigned under pressure in 2017 and will now host his own show on SiriusXM, told New York, \u201cTwo years ago, I would have sworn that I\u2019d never done anything to make anyone feel uncomfortable, but it\u2019s clear that I must have been doing something. As I\u2019ve said before, I feel terrible that anyone came away from an interaction with me feeling bad.\u201d\n\nThe woman says that at the time, she dreamed of running for office, and the incident \u201crocked my confidence \u2026 This created a moment of reflection on like, Who the hell do you think you are? There is something that tells men that they, particularly those who have a lot of power, that they have access to my body in some way that is based on the hierarchy of the organization that we\u2019re working in or society or whatever it is.\u201d\n\nWhen she saw the first news alert about Franken, the woman said, she burst into tears. \u201cI really considered adding my voice,\u201d she said. But years after the Franken incident, she had reported unwelcome attention from her boss at work and ended up leaving the job after feeling ostracized.\n\nShe dreams of being a cabinet secretary in a future Democratic administration, she said, and \u201cknowing the vetting process, I know that anything can be used as a flag to say, \u2018Not this person.\u2019 The idea that I would not get a job and would always wonder: Was it the article where I was the one who was raising my hand against a powerful man?\u201d", "description": "A woman alleges that Al Franken groped her buttocks in a photo line at a political event in 2006, explaining that the experience shattered her confidence and made her question whether she should pursue a career in politics.", "authors": ["Irin Carmon"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/27/27-al-franken.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
