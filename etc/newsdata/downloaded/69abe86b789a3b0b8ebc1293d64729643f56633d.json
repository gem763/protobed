We also believe faith-based perspectives have an important and ethically appropriate role in professional counseling.\n\n\" \u2026 The Church is concerned that the proposed professional licensing rule is ambiguous in key areas and overreaches in others. For example, it fails to protect individual religious beliefs and does not account for important realities of gender identity in the development of children.\"\n\nThe church wants the rule to take into account changes its Family Services unit wants.\n\nThe group Equality Utah, which fights for LGBTQ+ rights, tweeted its opposition to the state's stand, saying, \"Let's be clear. Studies have found that more than 60% of children subjected to conversion therapy attempt suicide. It's long past time to protect youth from this dangerous practice.\"\n\nGovernor Gary Herbert called for new rules after hearing reports about conversion therapy.\n\nAfter an earlier bill banning the practice failed, Equality Utah's Troy Williams quit the governor's suicide prevention task force, saying, \"Equality Utah will not be window dressing\" and claiming Herbert had turned his back on LGBTQ youth.\n\nThe American Psychiatry Association, which opposes conversion therapy, doubled down on its stand last year, saying it \"does not believe that same-sex orientation should or needs to be changed, and efforts to do so represent a significant risk of harm by subjecting individuals to forms of treatment which have not been scientifically validated and by undermining self-esteem when sexual orientation fails to change. No credible evidence exists that any mental health intervention can reliably and safely change sexual orientation; nor, from a mental health perspective does sexual orientation need to be changed.\n\nThe American Medical Association has also called on lawmakers to ban the practice. More than a dozen states have.", "description": "The church's stand is opposed by LGBTQ rights advocates, and the American Psychiatry Association and AMA, among others, also want the therapy banned", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/c529a3cc-d7a3-4e98-a87b-5863548eeac7/thumbnail/1200x630/2c7db66d53f6f1525fda93aa81f15d86/rtx43zh4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
