Activists are angry that the MTR closes stations to stop protesters from gathering and has demanded the company release CCTV footage of the beatings.\n\nPolice have responded to violence in recent weeks with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, several live shots in the air, water cannon and baton charges, prompting complaints of excessive force.\n\nAnd there were running battles with police in the same area, around Prince Edward MTR, on Friday and Saturday last week.\n\nProtesters also plan to gather outside the British consulate on Sunday to make sure China honors the Sino-British Joint Declaration which was signed in 1984, laying out the former British colony\u2019s future after its handover to China in 1997.\n\nChina says Hong Kong is now its internal affair.

It is celebrated with mooncakes, gazing at the full moon and colorful lantern displays.\n\nProtesters plan a series of lantern-carrying human chains and sit-ins at MTR shopping malls and on the city\u2019s scenic Victoria Peak, popular with mainland tour groups, and on Lion Rock, separating the New Territories from the Kowloon peninsula.\n\nThere were some lunchtime scuffles between pro-Beijing and anti-Hong Kong government supporters in the mall of the IFC, a prominent skyscraper on the newly reclaimed Central waterfront. Some top-brand stores were briefly closed.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A general view of Victoria Harbour and downtown skyline is seen from the Peak in Hong Kong, China August 4, 2017.
