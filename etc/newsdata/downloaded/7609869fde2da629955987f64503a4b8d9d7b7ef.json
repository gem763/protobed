Banks will have to be flexible and quick in anticipating client needs and the evolution of the market so as not to lose the direct relationship they have built with their customers,\" Costa said.", "description": "ECB's Costa says banks need to act fast as tech firm rivalry looms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9L18K_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
