You rummage through your suitcase and retrace your every step, but no luck.\n\nIf your driver\u2019s licence is missing, you should know you\u2019re not entirely without options when travelling\u2014at least, for domestic flights. For international flights, it\u2019ll be pretty close to impossible, depending on your exact circumstances.\n\nIf you\u2019re flying domestically, you may be able to get through security easily, as long as you have sufficient documentation and show a little kindness to the airport staff.\n\nAssuming you don\u2019t have another form of ID like a passport (or any other documents listed here), you should first inform an airline attendant of the situation, and ask about out your options. They\u2019ll likely point you in the direction of security and ask that you explain your circumstances to staff there.\n\nIn the absence of physical copies of any identifying documents, you should provide any copies of any ID you might have stashed on your phone or in your inbox. You might even ask a friend to photocopy an ID for you if they have access to it. (In fact, you should take photos of your passport and driver\u2019s licence on your phone right now for safekeeping.)\n\nIf you\u2019re flying internationally\n\nAs for international flights, you probably won\u2019t be so lucky if your passport is MIA; if you\u2019re headed overseas your airline will likely require a passport for you to fly. (This means, if you\u2019ve left it at home, you should probably head back to save yourself from the unnecessary stress.)\n\nOn the other hand, if ever you\u2019re stranded overseas without a passport, contact your local embassy or consulate to obtain a temporary travel document, as u/periphrazein recommends. If you alert them early enough prior to your flight, you might even be able to obtain a replacement passport.", "description": "You\u2019re about to leave for the airport, assured you\u2019ve followed your packing list to a tee, when you reach into your carry-on and panic sets in\u2014somehow, your driver\u2019s licence is nowhere to be found.
