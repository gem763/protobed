The late psychologist, Bruno Bettelheim, even raised the concern in an article for The Atlantic in 1987.\n\nResearchers at the University of Virginia, led by the education-policy researcher Daphna Bassok, analyzed survey responses from American kindergarten teachers between 1998 and 2010. \u201cAlmost every dimension that we examined,\u201d noted Bassok, \u201chad major shifts over this period towards a heightened focus on academics, and particularly a heightened focus on literacy, and within literacy, a focus on more advanced skills than what had been taught before.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the percentage of kindergarten teachers who reported that they agreed (or strongly agreed) that children should learn to read in kindergarten greatly increased from 30 percent in 1998 to 80 percent in 2010.\n\nBassok and her colleagues found that while time spent on literacy in American kindergarten classrooms went up, time spent on arts, music, and child-selected activities (like station time) significantly dropped. Teacher-directed instruction also increased, revealing what Bassok described as \u201cstriking increases in the use of textbooks and worksheets\u2026 and very large increases in the use of assessments.\u201d\n\nBut Finland\u2014a Nordic nation of 5.5 million people, where I\u2019ve lived and taught fifth and sixth graders over the last two years\u2014appears to be on the other end of the kindergarten spectrum. Before moving to Helsinki, I had heard that most Finnish children start compulsory, government-paid kindergarten\u2014or what Finns call \u201cpreschool\u201d\u2014at age 6. And not only that, but I learned through my Finnish mother-in-law\u2014a preschool teacher\u2014that Finland\u2019s kindergartners spend a sizable chunk of each day playing, not filling out worksheets.\n\nFinnish schools have received substantial media attention for years now\u2014largely because of the consistently strong performance of its 15-year-olds on international tests like the PISA. But I haven\u2019t seen much coverage on Finland\u2019s youngest students.\n\nSo, a month ago, I scheduled a visit to a Finnish public kindergarten\u2014where a typical school day is just four hours long.\n\n* * *\n\nApproaching the school\u2019s playground that morning, I watched as an army of 5- and 6-year-old boys patrolled a zigzagging stream behind Niirala Preschool in the city of Kuopio, unfazed by the warm August drizzle. When I clumsily unhinged the steel gate to the school\u2019s playground, the young children didn\u2019t even lift their eyes from the ground; they just kept dragging and pushing their tiny shovels through the mud.\n\nAt 9:30 a.m., the boys were called to line up for a daily activity called Morning Circle. (The girls were already inside\u2014having chosen to play boardgames indoors.) They trudged across the yard in their rubber boots, pleading with their teachers to play longer\u2014even though they had already been outside for an hour. As they stood in file, I asked them to describe what they\u2019d been doing on the playground.\n\n\n\n\u201cMaking dams,\u201d sang a chorus of three boys.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing else?\u201d one of their teachers prodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing else,\u201d they confirmed.\n\n\n\n\u201c[Children] learn so well through play,\u201d Anni-Kaisa Osei Ntiamoah, one of the preschool\u2019s \u201ckindergarten\u201d teachers, who\u2019s in her seventh year in the classroom, told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t even realize that they are learning because they\u2019re so interested [in what they\u2019re doing].\u201d", "description": "Forget the Common Core, Finland\u2019s youngsters are in charge of determining what happens in the classroom.", "authors": ["Timothy D.
