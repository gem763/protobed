You have to move your character manually by jogging or walking on the spot, while the Ring-Con is used to interact with objects in the world. Battles are fought not with magic, but with fitness moves like squats, and players will be able to adjust the resistance of the Ring-Con if they\u2019re too young/unfit for the default settings.\n\nSpeaking of the Ring-Con (below, right), it\u2019s a new peripheral that houses a Joy-Con in the top, so that it can sense how hard and fast you\u2019re... squeezing it. It\u2019s a pilates ring, basically, just one that\u2019s got Nintendo branding. There\u2019s also a leg strap for the other Joy-Con (below, left), so that it can detect the movement of your leg.\n\nThe game includes the Rig-Con and strap, and will launch in Australia on October 18, and is expected to cost around $124.95.", "description": "Nintendo is heading back into the fitness business with Ring Fit Adventure, a new game where you strap a Joy-Con onto your leg, put another in a big squeezy new peripheral and flail about like nobody\u2019s watching....", "authors": ["Leah Williams", "Cecilia D'Anastasio"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/tzqrl722ykemxd7ojlqn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
