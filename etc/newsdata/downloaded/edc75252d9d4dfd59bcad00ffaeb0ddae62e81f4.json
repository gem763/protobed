It also makes no reference to the Queen playing a role in the process.\n\nA Lib Dem source told MailOnline: 'To be PM Corbyn must demonstrate to the Queen that the majority of MPs support him. They do not, and will not.\n\n'He does not have the numbers, it\u2019s time for him to accept this so that we can move on in order to stop the UK crashing out of the EU.'\n\nEarlier this week, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson repeated her assertion that her party is ready to back a government of national unity but that it cannot be led by Mr Corbyn.\n\nShe said: 'That prime minister could be anybody that commands the confidence of the House of Commons.\n\n'Jeremy Corbyn doesn't have the numbers to command a majority and until he accepts that fact he could end up being the biggest block to stopping a No Deal Brexit.'\n\nDowning Street sources have previously suggested that Mr Johnson, pictured leaving Number 10 on October 3, would not step down even if he lost a vote of no confidence\n\nThe so-called Remain Alliance believes trying to force Mr Johnson out of Downing Street through a vote of no confidence is its option of last resort to stop a bad break from Brussels.\n\nThe alliance would likely only move forward with such an approach in the event that the PM refuses to comply with an anti-No Deal law which requires him to ask the EU for a Brexit extension if no divorce agreement has been struck by October 19.\n\nToday the government announced its intention for the Commons to sit on October 19, a Saturday, to allow MPs to respond to the outcome of a crunch EU summit taking place on the two previous days.\n\nThat means October 19 could be the moment when MPs pull the trigger on a vote of no confidence - assuming Mr Johnson has failed to secure a deal at that summit and if he tries to dodge or frustrate the so-called Benn Act.\n\nShould a vote of no confidence be held and Mr Johnson was to lose it, it is not immediately clear what would happen if he then refused to quit and make way for a new government.\n\nConstitutional experts are split on whether the Queen would have the power to make him step down.\n\nHowever, if a replacement PM was able to win a vote in the Commons on forming a new government it would be very difficult for Mr Johnson to try to stay in post.", "description": "The Labour leader said there is 'no process other than the leader of the opposition being invited to form that government' in the event that Mr Johnson is toppled.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline", "James Tapsfield", "Mailonline Political Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/15/19495198-0-image-a-9_1570630975680.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
