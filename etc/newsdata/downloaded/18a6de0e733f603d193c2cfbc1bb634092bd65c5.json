It belongs to the millions who support us all across the country, from the staff in Millbank and in the field to the volunteers and activists, including the million who marched in London nine days ago.\n\n\u201cLate last night, Roland Rudd, as outgoing chair of Open Britain (one of the founder organisations of the People\u2019s Vote campaign), sent an email to all staff announcing a boardroom coup. This email invited all staff to a meeting this morning, which Roland Rudd cancelled at the last minute, despite promises made. Instead he decided to go on TV.\n\n\u201cThe team are not prepared to wait around indefinitely for Roland Rudd to come and provide answers to our questions, so the overwhelming majority of the staff team decided to leave the building together.\n\n\u201cThis is a crucial week for the campaign and the country. With everything to play for in our unstinting efforts to secure a People\u2019s Vote, the last thing anyone needs is to be distracted by a few individuals playing boardroom politics. The team are now having a meeting to discuss how the People\u2019s Vote campaign, which we all care passionately about and have dedicated our lives to in recent years, continues to be the largest and most vibrant political movement in the country.\u201d\n\nMr Baldwin, a former spin doctor to Ed Miliband, said the row stemmed from Mr Rudd\u2019s preference for the campaign to fight openly for the UK to Remain in the EU, rather than to seek to persuade people on both sides of the Brexit battle that a public vote is the best way to settle the issue.\n\nBut Mr Rudd said that it was time for People\u2019s Vote to be reconstituted on a \u201cmore structured basis\u201d under a single chief executive.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

We new need a much clearer structure as we move forward.\u201d\n\nMr Baldwin told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt\u2019s a curious situation. We are three days before the Brexit deadline with the prospect of crashing into a general election or out of the EU per both. The Liberal Democrats appear to be playing games\u2026 they have abandoned their principled support for a People\u2019s Vote.\n\n\u201cRoland Rudd has chosen this time to put a wrecking ball through the campaign\u2026 He is making the mistake that a lot of businessmen do when they dabble in politics, which is to think that because they have a certain title on a board, they then own the campaign.\n\n\u201cThe People\u2019s Vote campaign belongs to the people, not just to one businessman who is hardly ever seen in the campaign.\u201d\n\nMr Rudd told Today that there were opportunities for Mr Baldwin to take a different role in the campaign, saying he wanted to have \u201ca proper civilised chat\u201d with him about it.\n\n\u201cThis is an absurd argument,\u201d said Mr Rudd \u2013 brother of former home secretary Amber Rudd. \u201cEveryone knows perfectly well that we are made up of people who want to Remain.\u201d\n\nHe complained that elements in the campaign were undermining the push for a referendum by alienating possible support with attacks on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Liberal Democrats.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t get involved in these kinds of politics,\u201d said Mr Rudd. \u201cWe are making a coalition with people from all parties and it\u2019s not for us to write off any one political party or any leadership.\u201d\n\nHe said there was a \u201creal opportunity\u201d this week of having a second referendum attached to Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nMr McGrory released a picture of the People\u2019s Vote staff on social media, with a message to say: \u201cIt\u2019s easily the greatest privilege of my professional life to be part of such an amazing team at the People\u2019s Vote campaign. All this fantastic group of dedicated and passionate professionals want to do \u2013 and all we\u2019ve ever wanted \u2013 is to campaign for and get a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has worked with People\u2019s Vote on its Final Say referendum campaign, including collaborating on staging three demonstrations in central London that were among the largest ever seen in the UK.", "description": "Staff at the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second Brexit referendum have staged a walkout after an attempt to sack two of its most senior figures in what they branded a \u201cboardroom coup\u201d.
