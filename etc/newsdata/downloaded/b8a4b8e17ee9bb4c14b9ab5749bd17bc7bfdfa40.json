He had said he \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than ask the EU to delay Brexit.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk, posted on Twitter: \u201cThe extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\u201d\n\nA second letter, signed by Johnson, says he believes that a delay would be a mistake.\n\n\u201cAlthough I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week,\u201d he wrote in the second letter to Tusk. \u201cI remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October.\n\n\u201cWhile it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister \u2026 that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\n\n\u201cWe must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the government said it would try to pass its deal again on Monday.\n\nThe vote came during a meeting in which Johnson sought a vote on his Brexit deal. The meeting, coined \u201csuper Saturday,\u201d was the first time Parliament has met on a weekend since the Falkland War between Britain and Argentina in 1982.\n\nJohnson had warned he may ignore the amendment because the best thing for Britain would be to leave the European Union with a deal Oct. 31.\n\n\u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cFurther delay will be bad for this country.\n\n\u201cAlas, the opportunity to have a meaningful vote has effectively been passed up.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was held amid a march in opposition to Johnson\u2019s deal in London.\n\nJohnson kicked off the meeting by presenting the Brexit deal he reached Thursday with the European Union.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party member Sammy Wilson suggested the party\u2019s MPs would back the Oliver Letwin Amendment, which would withhold approval of Johnson\u2019s deal until Parliament passes legislation required to implement Johnson\u2019s plan.\n\nMP Chris Grayling warned that passage of the Letwin amendment may delay the vote again.\n\nIf Johnson\u2019s deal had passed, the vote could have been the most significant step towards Brexit since British voters approved a referendum to leave the European Union three years ago.\n\nHis predecessor, Theresa May, repeatedly failed to pass a Brexit proposal.\n\nMay\u2019s deal featured a safety net clause to save Britain from a no-deal Brexit. Johnson\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t have that clause.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal also maintains some European Union rules in Northern Ireland, which critics fear could spark sectarian violence.\n\nSaturday\u2019s debate came as tens of thousands marched outside in opposition at a People\u2019s Vote March, demanding a \u201cfinal say\u201d in the vote.\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote campaign organizers are asking supporters to sign a letter to Boris Johnson and other leaders asking them to allow \u201cthe chance to check whether we want to proceed with Brexit.\u201d\n\nPublic opinion on Brexit may have flipped from a referendum three years ago, with a narrow majority now favoring staying inside the European Union.", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 The British Parliament on Saturday passed an amendment delaying a vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s European Union", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
