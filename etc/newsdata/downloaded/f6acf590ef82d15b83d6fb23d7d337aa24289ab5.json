It plunged nearly 16% Tuesday, dropping below $9,000 for the first time in three months. But with so much concern surrounding the cryptocurrency, what\u2019s next for bitcoin?\n\n\u201cBitcoin is vulnerable but I don\u2019t think the thesis is broken.

I mean l think long term holders should not worry,\u201d said Tom Lee, who is Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of Research, who joined Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\nLee went on to explain that the decline has not surprised him. This dip was foreshadowed in the beginning of July, when Lee observed the Bitcoin Misery Index broke below 66. He warned that once it reaches 50, no one should dabble in the cryptocurrency.\n\n\u201cThe S&P being trendless is not good for bitcoin,\u201d he said. \u201cThe S&P needs to make new a high before bitcoin can break out.\u201d\n\nGolden Bitcoins More\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is the halvening next year. But if someone is trying to trade bitcoin, it\u2019s been really treacherous because the S&P is unpredictable and it\u2019s been volatile,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how anyone could be trading bitcoin right now.\u201d\n\nRalston Ramsay is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nThis company lets you invest in fine art for as little as ... - Yahoo Finance\n\nNow men can customize suits by using an AI-powered \"Style Wall\"\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner and Head of Research, Tom Lee discusses bitcoin and his equity market outlook.", "authors": ["Ralston Ramsay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zW0sQJtazZ.G__sMsBjQWw--~B/aD0zMzg2O3c9NTA3OTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/0c977bb0-7656-11e9-abdb-a76b463bb80f", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
