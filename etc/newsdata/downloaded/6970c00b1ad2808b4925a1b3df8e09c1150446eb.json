Bush is worse than \u2018problematic\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Viewers tore into TV comedian Ellen DeGeneres after she offered a lukewarm \u2018can't we all just get along\u2019 explanation for laughing it up with former president and regime-change aficionado George W. Bush at a football game.\n\nAssuming the fans' initial rage had to do with \u201ca gay Hollywood liberal sitting next to a conservative Republican president\u201d at a Dallas Cowboys football game over the weekend, DeGeneres stressed that just because her political views didn't align with the president who started two long and bloody wars, didn't mean they couldn't be friends.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump says he\u2019ll leave \u2018very strong intelligence\u2019 in Afghanistan, invokes Bush rationale for war\n\n\u201cI'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have,\u201d she said on her show on Tuesday, comparing her disagreements with Bush to disagreeing with her \u201cfriends who wear fur.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're all different and I think we've forgotten that it's OK that we're all different,\u201d she continued earnestly, imploring her viewers to \u201cbe kind\u201d to those unlike themselves.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing, Ellen, George W. Bush is a war criminal who is responsible for death on a cataclysmic scale. It\u2019s not a matter of being friends with people with different beliefs\u2014we all have those friends\u2014it\u2019s about having a little perspective on the damage he\u2019s done. https://t.co/7FJTqPEfb8 \u2014 Walker Bragman (@WalkerBragman) October 8, 2019\n\nSocial media users quickly reminded her that it wasn't Bush\u2019s political opinions they took issue with, but his actions while in office.\n\nThere's a difference between \"my conservative friend and I disagree on politics\" and \"I'm friends with Mussolini. He's actually really nice in person.\" \u2014 AdrienneBarbeauBot (@BotBarbeau) October 8, 2019\n\nLiberals have literally rehabilitated George Bush from the war criminal that killed over one million Iraqis based on lies, to the man that passes Michelle Obama candy, and hangs out with Ellen DeGeneres on weekends. \u2014 Kevin Thee Donkey \ud83c\udf39 (@swallowit_) October 8, 2019\n\n\"I'm friends with George W. Bush.\"\n\n\n\nChrist, Ellen. The guy is a war criminal of epic proportions. His ginned up illegal war on Iraq led to the death/displacement of a million people. For God's sake, his family funded the Nazis.\n\n\n\nHe should be in prison & you should be ashamed. \u2014 Aaron\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8Niswander (@aaron_niswander) October 8, 2019\n\nThe arguments were that Bush wasn't exactly a fan of the LGBT community. \u201cHe would lock you and Portia in separate cages if you weren't both rich,\u201d pointed out one user, referring to the actress DeGeneres married in 2008, while another mentioned he had campaigned against gay marriage.\n\nOthers reasoned that when one moves in DeGeneres' elite circles, it's impossible to avoid running into a few war criminals - or suggested that part of her job was making such \"monsters\" palatable to the general population.\n\nEllen's brain/heart/soul has been fossilized by all that corporate ca$h. it's proven that one's ability to empathize is greatly diminished the more money one has.. more cash = less humane. less cash = more humane. \u2014 Lightnin Riddle's Mamaw Residue (@kymountainwoman) October 8, 2019\n\nWhen some of Ellen's fellow TV personalities stepped in to back her up, they, too, got shredded.\n\nhow many of your friends are war criminals i wonder \u2014 mx spookey brooke (@dirak_) October 8, 2019\n\nDeGeneres isn't the only liberal to embrace Bush in his later years, helping him reinvent himself from a wildly unpopular commander-in-chief to a simple old man painting pictures of cats and world leaders. President Barack Obama and his aides also discovered a fondness for his predecessor after Trump came into the White House.\n\nA good day to pause and cherish the memory of better times. pic.twitter.com/kiKmQcktpa \u2014 Valerie Jarrett (@ValerieJarrett) September 25, 2019\n\nLike this story?
