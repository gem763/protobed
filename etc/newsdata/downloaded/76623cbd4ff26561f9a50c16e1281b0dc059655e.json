In March 2013, a total of six South Korean TV stations and banks experienced freezes in their computer networks, which officials in Seoul later traced to North Korean hackers operating out of China.The attack damaged up to 32,000 computers and prompted the South\u2019s communications watchdog, the Korea Communications Commission, to raise their alert level.A better-known incident involved the hacking of Sony Pictures in November 2014, when a group calling itself the Guardians of Peace released confidential information about the company demanding that it not release the comedy film \u201cThe Interview,\u201d which mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.With the hackers threatening terrorist attacks at cinemas that screened the film, Sony eventually canceled a formal premiere and released the movie directly to streaming services.In more recent years, the group tapped into the global cryptocurrency boom by targeting trading operations in South Korea using software similar to that used in the Sony hack. Bithumb, a South Korean exchange company, reported that $7 million was stolen from it in February 2017, while another company, Youbit, had to file for bankruptcy as a result of a similar attack.A confidential United Nations report from August, according to Reuters, alleged that North Korea may have generated approximately $2 billion from such cyberattacks around the globe as part of a concerted effort to generate foreign currency as its economy chokes under international sanctions.The U.S. State Department, Reuters said, commented on this report that North Korea\u2019s cyber activity \u201cgenerates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD (weapons of mass destruction) and ballistic missile programs.\u201dLast month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on three cyber groups that included Lazarus Group, which it said were subordinate to North Korean intelligence.BY SHIM KYU-SEOK [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
