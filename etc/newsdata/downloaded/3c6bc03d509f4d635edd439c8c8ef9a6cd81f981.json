REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde\n\nAnother teenager, one of about 400 men and boys freed in Thursday\u2019s police raid, said boys were often kept in chains and those caught stealing food were whipped until they bled.\n\n\u201cThey used car engine belts and electrical cables to flog us,\u201d 15-year-old Suleiman told Reuters, staring at the floor. \u201cTeachers used to sexually harass us ... They tried to loosen my pants once but I fought them off and was beaten.\u201d\n\nHorror stories are emerging about life in a two-storey house in Nigeria\u2019s northern city of Kaduna as the authorities try to find families of the victims who often spent years at the site.\n\nPolice arrested seven adults in the raid on the building, which had a sign in Arabic at the entrance declaring itself \u201cHouse of Imam Ahmad Bin Hanbal for the Application of Islamic Teachings\u201d.\n\nSome parents paid fees, believing it was an Islamic school. Some described it as a good institution and dismissed talk of abuse. Others saw it as a correctional facility. Police and regional officials said it was not registered as either.\n\nDespite mixed accounts about its role, the abuse reported by victims has thrown a spotlight on Nigeria\u2019s struggle to provide enough school places for its rapidly expanding population, leaving a gap for unregulated institutions that poor parents sometimes turn to.\n\nThe West African nation\u2019s population will swell from 190 million to 400 million by 2050, according to U.N. figures. Primary education is officially free but about 10.5 million Nigerian children aged five to 14 are not in school.\n\n\u201cNigeria is facing a demographic tidal wave,\u201d said Matthew Page, an associate fellow with the Africa Programme at Britain\u2019s Royal Institute of International Affairs.\n\n\u201cThe long-term viability of the Nigerian economy - and the state itself - hinges on the government, religious, and traditional institutions developing a plan to address this challenge before it becomes impossible to remedy,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior to Thursday\u2019s police raid, those who made it out of the Kaduna institution were sometimes returned by families. Some parents said they needed to discipline wayward children and others said they were too poor to look after all their kids.\n\nKaduna state government said there were at least 77 boys under 18 years old held there. The youngest was five.\n\nReuters spoke with seven victims and five parents of those who had been inside, withholding their full names to protect their privacy.\n\nSHACKLED\n\nAll the victims said beatings were regular and said children and men were frequently shackled. Days were dark, long and hungry: food was only served at 10 a.m. and 11 p.m.\n\nSuleiman\u2019s elder brother sent him to the institution five months ago for skipping school. He was signed up to board while he studied Arabic and Islam\u2019s holy book, the Quran.\n\n\u201cThey beat us everywhere in the house, even in the mosque. If you asked to speak with your family, they would shackle you,\u201d said the 15-year-old, who showed sores, scabs and scars on back.\n\nWhen Suleiman and three friends were caught trying to steal some garri - a staple food made from cassava shavings - they were stripped and whipped, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the police raided the school the whole place was in pandemonium, we were so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I want now is to return home. I\u2019ll be a good boy.\u201dJibril, now 17 and who was hung up for trying to escape when he was 10, said boys faced a stark choice: submit to regular sexual assault or be beaten. Jibril chose beatings.\n\n\u201cThe teachers and prefects raped boys. Those who were sexually molested were enticed with canned fish. Those of us who refused were caned,\u201d he said, blaming a scar beside his left eye on a caning. \u201cThey used planks of wood to beat us.\u201d\n\nHe now struggles to raise his arms since his punishment for trying to escape. He was sent home for six months after that incident. His family returned him when he had healed.\n\nJibril and Suleiman are now in a safehouse on the edge of Kaduna while the authorities try to find their relatives. Their temporary home is filled with laughter as boys and teenagers, up to 17 years old, play together. Those adults who were freed are staying in a neighbouring building.\n\nAt the Kaduna institution, relatives were not allowed to see boys for three months after admission and had limited visiting rights after that, parents and children said. Punishment was swift for those who talked of any abuse, boys said.\n\n\u201cIf anyone tried to tell their family, they would be hung up from a wall or put in chains,\u201d said 14-year-old Umar, whose grandfather sent him to the facility two years ago for skipping school.\n\nSEXUAL ABUSE\n\nAbout 40 police officers finally raided the building, acting on a complaint by an uncle who was denied access to his nephews.\n\nPolice said they found several boys and men in chains. Reuters filmed victims in chains on Thursday after the raid. Some boys said they were shackled to broken power generators, which they dragged around, including to bed or the bathroom.\n\nPolice said they expected to charge seven people, who they said ran the institution, over physical and sexual abuse allegations. Those arrested could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe building lies in Rigasa, a rundown Muslim district of Kaduna, a city that, like Nigeria, is evenly split between Muslims and Christians.\n\nReuters journalists who visited the labyrinthine building saw wheels and generators attached to metal chains. Floors were strewn with litter and stained sponge mattresses. Flies swarmed.\n\nChildren begged in the traffic on the streets outside.\n\nIslamic schools, known as Almajiris, are common across the mostly Muslim north of Nigeria. Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), a local organisation, estimates about 10 million children attend Islamic schools in the north.\n\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, a Muslim, has sought to encourage school attendance, with programmes that include one offering free school meals that the government says reaches 9.8 million children in 32 of Nigeria\u2019s 36 states.\n\nBut Nigeria, an oil producing state whose finances by the government\u2019s admission have been drained by corruption, only spends 0.5% of gross domestic product on health and 1.7% on education, among the lowest worldwide, the International Monetary Fund said.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nWith few options, some parents defended the Kaduna institution, which charged fees of 35,000 naira ($114) a term.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem in this school,\u201d said a woman who only gave her name as Zainab, wearing a Muslim veil and speaking outside the locked gates. She said she had seven children at the institution where she cooked meals and had not seen any abuse.\n\nAhmed Balrabe, a tailor who lives next to the site, said two of his children attended the school and he had never encountered any abuse. \u201cIt was good for them, they became calm,\u201d he said. \u201cThey showed them how to read the Quran. I liked it.\u201d", "description": "When Jibril had tried to escape as a boy from an institution in Nigeria that called itself a place of Islamic teachings, he said he was hung up by his arms until bones in his shoulders broke.", "authors": ["Alexis Akwagyiram", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435197630&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0FQ", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
