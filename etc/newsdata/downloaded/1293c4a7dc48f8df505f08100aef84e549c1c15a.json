Anyway, have a look. It\u2019s mildly clever, but it really seems to miss the mark about why people are worked up; they\u2019re not angry at a child, they\u2019re angry at the adults behind the child.\n\nTHE GRETA THUNBERG HELPLINE:\n\nFor adults angry at a child. pic.twitter.com/JAtIKyG4Va \u2014 Mark Humphries (@markhumphries) September 26, 2019\n\n1. Wow this is painfully unfunny. Yikes 2. Y\u2019all still don\u2019t get it. We\u2019re not mad at Greta. We\u2019re mad at y\u2019all for using her as a human shield to push an agenda. It\u2019s very simple. https://t.co/DMIYx8PBzq \u2014 Jason Howerton (@jason_howerton) September 28, 2019\n\nIf we\u2019re angry, we\u2019re angry at the people who have convinced a child that there\u2019s no point in going to school because the planet will be uninhabitable regardless, and the people who continue to fuel her anxiety for a socialist agenda.\n\nI feel sad for her, that the adults responsible for her, who should want the best for her, exploit her in such a cruel manner. Whoever writes \"her\" tweets, yes, you \u2014 Nicolas de Cuse (@NickdeCusa) September 26, 2019\n\nIf the claims of climate change alarmists had any merit, they wouldn't have to make them through a 16-year old sock puppet who nobody is allowed to challenge. \u2014 Jane Galt (@WhoisJaneGalt) September 26, 2019\n\nShe's not trying to save the planet. She's pushing an ideology she believes in and financed by who will take advantage out of its implementation. \u2014 Sinbad the Sailor (@chrisachilli) September 26, 2019\n\nIn the style of a Motte and Bailey argument the left exploits a child to promote an ideologically inspired view of climate science. Any criticism is defended not by counter argument or evidence but by falling back to the irrelevant truism that one should not be cruel to a child. \u2014 \ud83d\udca7Innoculous (@HorusKairos) September 26, 2019\n\nNone of this would happen if @GretaThunberg called the CLIMATE CHANGE HELPLINE instead for being angry 'we' took her childhood \ud83d\ude42 #FuckOffGreta #GretaThunberg \u2014 Mladen Jovanovi\u0107 (@Physical_Prep) September 26, 2019\n\n#GretaThunberg needs the anger management helpline more than anyone else #fact \u2014 manya patil seth (@manyavar) September 27, 2019\n\nWeak. \u2014 Dr Beak \ud83d\udda4 (@DoctaBeak) September 27, 2019\n\nYea. Maybe it's not the child people are angry at, but her handlers. You know, the people using her to push an agenda. It's so obvious she's reading what someone else has written for her. She's an actress playing a part to bring about global socialism. \u2014 \ud83d\udd25 (@AsTheWorldBurnz) September 28, 2019\n\nI mean, the top 5 countries she's after about climate change just happen to be the richest, but not the top polluters.

I can process feelings & handle conflict without melting down like my toddler. I don\u2019t t have to yell at someone or need a helpline to deal with issues. Clearly, they\u2019re mirror imaging how they cope with their issues. They need to grow up. \u2014 Phaidra Lancaster (@PhaidraLinKS) September 28, 2019\n\nI actually feel for her. As a child they scared me with ozone holes and acid rain. That\u2019s what makes me mad. She\u2019s scared for no reason.
