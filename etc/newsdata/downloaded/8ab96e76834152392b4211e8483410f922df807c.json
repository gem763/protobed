Congress has voted several times to block that emergency declaration.\n\nThe Supreme Court handed Trump a victory on the wall in July, voting to block a ruling by a federal judge that blocked him from redirecting $2.5 billion in funds.", "description": "Trump signs into law stopgap U.S. federal funding through November 21", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8Q20P_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
