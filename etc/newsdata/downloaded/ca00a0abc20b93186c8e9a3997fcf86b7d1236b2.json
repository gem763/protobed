The FIA had no intention of investigating his driving until his own bravado got the better of him.\n\nAsked in the post-qualifying press conference if he had backed off, the Dutchman bristled: 'It didn't really look like it, did it? No.'\n\nThe foolhardy driver was then summoned by the stewards, looking at the data afresh, to explain his comments. They found him guilty of 'failure to slow for a yellow flag'.\n\nHamilton, who must outscore his Mercedes team-mate Bottas by 14 points to land the title, said: 'It's important that the FIA are really strict about the double yellow flags.\n\n'Max didn't even need to go flat-out. He had already got pole with his previous lap.\n\n'For all he knew, Valtteri could have been in the middle of the circuit. It's not great.'\n\nMax Verstappen points to the first place plinth after taking pole for the Mexican Grand Prix\n\nVerstappen is hoping to win the race for the third consecutive year in a row\n\nThere was controversy over Verstappen's pole though as he appeared to ignore yellow flags as a result of Bottas's crash at the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit\n\nVerstappen gives the thumbs up ahead of second placed Charles Leclerc (right) and his third placed Ferrari team-mate Sebastian Vettel\n\nFans look on at Verstappen during qualifying in the baseball stadium section of the circuit\n\nMEXICAN GP QUALIFYING TIMES 1 Verstappen (Hol) Red Bull 1:14.758 2 Leclerc (Mon) Ferrari 1:15.024 3 Vettel (Ger) Ferrari 1:15.170 4 Hamilton (Gbr) Mercedes 1:15.262 5 Albon (Tha) Red Bull 1:15.336 6 Bottas (Fin) Mercedes 1:15.338 7 Sainz (Spa) McLaren 1:16.014 8 Norris (Gbr) McLaren 1:16.322 9 Kvyat (Rus) Toro Rosso 1:16.469 10 Gasly (Fra) Toro Rosso 1:16.586 11 Perez (Mex) Racing Point 1:16.687 12 Hulkenberg (Ger) Renault 1:16.885 13 Ricciardo (Aus) Renault 1:16.933 14 Raikkonen (Fin) A.

It was a nerve thing, so for a few minutes I couldn't feel my right knee but there is no pain now.'\n\nThe team were toiling to piece the car back together, but boss Toto Wolff said he was '90 per cent' confident they could do so without incurring any penalties.\n\nMercedes, meanwhile, have opened contract talks with Hamilton in an attempt to help him make more history.\n\nHis sixth title will lift him ahead of Juan Manuel Fangio and behind only Michael Schumacher in the list of motor-racing achievement. And, at 34, Hamilton probably has one giant contract to play for as he guns for titles seven and eight.\n\nMercedes are desperate to keep hold of him even it means granting a significant rise on his current \u00a340million-a-year salary.\n\nHis contract runs until the end of next season, as do those of the other top drivers. They are all unwilling to rush into committing their futures beyond then with new regulations due to be introduced for 2021.\n\nBut Mercedes boss Toto Wolff revealed: 'Discussions with Lewis have slowly but surely started.\n\nLewis Hamilton could not keep up with Ferrari or Verstappen but was fourth fastest", "description": "JONATHAN McEVOY IN MEXICO CITY: Lewis Hamilton was given an unexpected leg-up towards claiming his sixth world title after Max Verstappen was stripped of pole position for the Mexican Grand Prix.", "authors": ["Jonathan Mcevoy For Mail Online"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/20/20224340-0-image-a-25_1572118988325.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
