It had Egyptian Page managers. The most interesting Pages included Gaddafi nostalgia content, like this Page.

According to the company, this campaign showed a link to the Internet Regency Agency (IRA), an organisation US prosecutors say was funded by Prigozhin and aimed at influencing the 2016 US presidential vote.", "description": "Company says accounts targeted people in Madagascar, CAR, Mozambique, DRC, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/6/c8236b3f5bbe4344bbc971db1e28abfb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
