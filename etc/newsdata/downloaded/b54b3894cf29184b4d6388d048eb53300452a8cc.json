Amid the chaos, at least 20 prisoners also escaped into the streets.\n\nSecurity Minister Alfonso Durazo said the reason they decided to release 28-year-old Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a leader of the Sinaloa cartel, was to protect life.\n\n\u201cThe decision was taken to retreat from the house, without Guzman, to try to avoid more violence in the area and preserve the lives of our personnel and recover calm in the city,\u201d Durazo told Reuters.\n\nDurazo made a televised addressed, explaining that the army and national guard were conducting a routine patrol in a neighborhood in Culiacan when they were fired upon from a house.\n\nMexican authorities were able to get the upper hand and take control of the house, where they found Guzman among those inside.\n\nThings quickly devolved into chaos, however, when cartel members \u201csurrounded the house with a greater force\u201d \u2013overpowering authorities. While that was happening, \u201cother groups carried out violent actions against citizens in various points of the city, generating a situation of panic,\u201d Durazo said.\n\nIndeed, photos from the city made it look like they were taken in a war-torn country.\n\nMexico releases El Chapo's son 'to protect lives' amid chaos in Sinaloa city https://t.co/VYk2ZnLv3z pic.twitter.com/yvG4dDVifh \u2014 New York Post (@nypost) October 18, 2019\n\nA gun battle with high-caliber weapons rocked the streets of Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of Mexico's Sinaloa state.\n\n\n\nIt is home to Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman\u2019s Sinaloa cartel #culiacanzonadeguerra pic.twitter.com/JjuFy1ftnw \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 18, 2019\n\nSheesh RT @BZR924: Sinaloa Cartel members arriving with Rocket Launchers in retaliation to El Chapos sons being held captive/Dead #Culiac\u00e1n pic.twitter.com/GlwArvMms6 \u2014 Arkelly (@ToCatchADavid) October 18, 2019\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the government's decision may have had to do with authorities being taken hostage.\n\nThe former official said gunmen sent at least two videos to military commanders stationed in Culiac\u00e1n, one showing members of a captured army patrol being held hostage, and another showing a soldier in uniform, bound and barefoot, being executed with a gunshot to the head on a street in the Sinaloan capital. It wasn\u2019t clear if the soldier shot in the video was a hostage taken in Thursday\u2019s surge of violence. (WSJ)\n\nAccording to initial reports, at least two people died and 21 were injured during the fighting.\n\nFalko Ernst, senior analyst for the International Crisis Group in Mexico, told Reuters Guzman\u2019s release was \u201ca dangerous precedent\u201d \u2013signaling to nonstate actors that the government was not in control and could be blackmailed.\n\nAlejandro Hope, a former member of Mexico\u2019s intelligence agency, echoed those remarks.\n\n\u201cThe only thing worse than trying to capture a drug lord without a plan and setting off urban warfare is trying to capture a drug lord without a plan, setting off urban warfare, and letting him go,\u201d he told WSJ.\n\nIndeed, many observers agreed the situation was a national embarrassment for Mexico.\n\nThis is shocking, and an absolute disaster for the Mexican government:\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the army managed to keep El Chapo\u2019s son in custody \u2014 or whether it turned him\n\nback over to the narcos. https://t.co/8O95nWGXQy \u2014 Kate Linthicum (@katelinthicum) October 18, 2019\n\nMexican soldiers being overthrown by #Sinaloa cartel members at a toll booth in #Culiac\u00e1n during today's shootouts.
