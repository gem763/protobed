She also faces 10 years of probation after her sentence is finished.\n\nHanding down the sentence, Superior Court Judge Michael Wolverton said the crime was as horrific an offence as he had ever dealt with \u2013 and that while Virgilio was not a monster and had shown remorse, she had done a \"horrific, horrific, thing\".\n\nAhead of her sentencing the now-32-year-old murderer said mental illness had driven her to the crime, adding that she was frustrated because she could not even put a motive to the killing.\n\n\"I hate me for what I did. I can never bring him back,\u201d she told the court, adding \u201cYou can't make sense out of a mind that makes no sense\".\n\nVirgilio\u2019s family said her mental state had begun to decline when she turned 20 and began taking arrange of drugs including Oxytocin and cocaine.\n\nShe eventually moved on to injecting meth, and disappeared on a two-week, drug-fuelled bender five months before her crime took place.\n\nIt was then she began to slip into a state of drug-induced psychosis, becoming obsessed with fir and, in one instance, attempting to kill her child.\n\nThe infant was taken away from her shortly before she murdered her partner. In another incident, her brother Reginald Carney took her to the hospital after growing concerned she would take her own life.\n\nShe was released with a prognosis of drug-induced psychosis, and was told the condition would pass.\n\nAt the time of her killing, she was found to have no drugs or alcohol in her system.\n\nVirgilio added: \u201cEverything that ever happened with my son, with Michael, it was from my mind. When you believe something, you act on those things.\"\n\nOutside the courtroom, the victim's youngest brother was relieved with the sentence and happy to have the seven-year ordeal over.\n\n\"I believe as long as she gets out at a late enough age to where she's not a danger to me, my family or society, I'm OK with it,\" Austine Gonzalez said.\n\nNow receiving treatment, Virgilio told the court her life and mental state had returned to normal, and that she was engaged with a faith-based therapeutic programme at her prison as well as a running programme.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "A woman who poured petrol on her boyfriend as he slept after his birthday party, set him on fire and closed the door as he burned to death will serve 60 years in prison.Michael Gonzales was sleeping in the early hours after celebrating turning 24 when partner Gina Virgilio, who was 25 at the time, attacked", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/44lhf6J3_NzLUmuhxZ_nFA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/277e09ef2854a522194f41a49bdd2928", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
