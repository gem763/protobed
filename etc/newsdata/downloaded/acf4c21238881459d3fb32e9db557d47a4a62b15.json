That's despite the two nations agreeing to meet in early October. \"[The] base case for the trade war now is no deal before the 2020 US election,\" Citigroup said in a research note to clients.\n\nAmid an economic landscape littered with uncertainty, key recession indicators are painting a bleak picture.\n\nFor starters, since August 14, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note has dipped below the 2-year yield more than once. Typically, long-term bonds have a higher interest rate than short-term bonds when the market is performing well. When the opposite is true, it means that an inversion of the yield curve has taken place, with this event occurring before the last seven recessions.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that gross domestic product (GDP) fell from 3% in the first quarter of 2019 to 2% in the following quarter.\n\nWith corporate earnings growth and manufacturing growth both declining, investors are now searching for stocks that can survive a potential recession and flaring trade tensions as \"implied probabilities of a 2020 recession are now high enough to warrant caution,\" according to Citigroup.\n\nBearing all of this in mind, analysts have highlighted a few defensible stocks that make compelling investments when the alarm has been sounded by key recession indicators.\n\nHere are 3 stocks to buy amid flashing recession warning signals.\n\nLockheed Martin Corporation (LMT)\n\nAccording to some analysts, the defense and aerospace contractor has the weapons it needs to fight off recession threats. Demand in the defense space is expected to remain steady as there are always conflicts regardless of the state of the market.\n\nPart of Lockheed\u2019s appeal lies in its strength as a dividend stock. It consistently raises its dividend, with the yield at 2% and current annualized payout at $8.80 per share.\n\n\u201cDividend investing is a defensive investment style that generates regular cash flows for investors and tends to outperform when markets are volatile,\u201d stated UBS global chief investment officer Mark Haefele in a note to clients.\n\nLMT has seen almost two decades of at or above 10% annual boosts, resulting in a decade-long dividend growth of more than 16% on average. With the company raising its full-year diluted EPS guidance from $20.05 to $20.35 to between $20.85 and $21.15 and posting an increase in cash generated from operations on July 23, LMT looks poised to boost its dividend once again.\n\nAdding to the good news, LMT was awarded a $347 million contract from the U.S. Army as part of the multi-year hypersonic weapons development program on August 29. This is on top of the two contracts from the pentagon, worth $32.1 million and $12 million, respectively, it received earlier in August for modifications to F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter planes.\n\nBased on all of the above factors, Berenberg Bank analyst Andrew Gollan reiterated his Buy rating and $410 price target on July 24. The four-star analyst believes share prices could gain 7% over the next twelve months.\n\nDespite the volatility in the broader market, shares of the telecommunications company are up 15% in the last three months.\n\nWhile AT&T has faced its fair share of headwinds in its TV segment as well as amassed debt of almost $160 billion, the company has made progress in both of these areas. On August 30, T announced a multi-year agreement with Starz to offer its full content lineup on AT&T\u2019s network. The company has also been consistently paying off its debt.\n\nMost importantly, AT&T stands to become one of the key players in the 5G space thanks to its upcoming network rollout. Once the network is active, it\u2019s expected that the company will be able to improve its pricing power and see the number of devices on its network grow, driving revenue to new heights.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t hurt that AT&T has cemented its status as a top dividend stock with a dividend yield of 5.8% as well as a current annualized payout of $2.04 per share. With an already impressive 35 consecutive years of dividend increases, analysts expect T to continue to reward investors.\n\nAll of the above as well as a strong Q2 performance lends itself to Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael\u2019s conclusion that the company is on pace to meet or even exceed its 2019 guidance. As a result, the five-star analyst reiterated his Buy rating while raising the price target from $34 to $40 on July 25. He thinks that shares could surge 13% over the next twelve months.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It\u2019s undeniable that many investors fear a recession is on the way, with the ongoing U.S.-China trade war not doing much to quell these concerns.
