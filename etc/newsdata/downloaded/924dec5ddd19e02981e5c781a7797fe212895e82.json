Quill was ordered off after referee Nic Berry checked video replays. Quill\u2019s the first American to get a red at a Rugby World Cup.\n\nEngland utterly dominated across the field in Kobe and it could have been ever more painful for the U.S. if not for a number of missed chances by the English.\n\nFlyhalf George Ford sliced through for the first try between the posts in the sixth minute. Forwards Billy Vunipola and Luke Cowan-Dickie drove over from rolling mauls within eight minutes of each other and England led 19-0 by halftime.\n\nWing Joe Cokanasiga secured the four-try bonus point early in the second half with the first of his two tries. The other wing, Ruaridh McConnochie, and flanker Lewis Ludlam also crossed.\n\nIt went wrong for the U.S. from the start, when promising young prop David Ainu\u2019u went off with what appeared to be a serious foot injury two minutes in and after the English had crumpled the U.S. scrum.\n\nThe U.S. also had a man taken off on a stretcher in the closing minutes.\n\nEngland, which even rested a couple of its top players, had nearly 80% of the territory and barely let the U.S. into its own half.\n\nEngland has two wins from two and two bonus points to top Pool C after beating Tonga 35-3 on Sunday.\n\nThe U.S. has a hard road ahead in a pool that also contains France, Argentina and Tonga.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "England pummeled the United States 45-7 at the Rugby World Cup on Thursday, winning with seven tries to one against an American team that was already out of it when an Eagle was sent off late for a dangerous tackle.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/26/japan_rugby_wcup_england_usa_70812_c0-182-4353-2720_s1770x1032.jpg?d27472741f9acd1156afde913ff54a38a995d315", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
