In 1982, Biden voted for an amendment that would have allowed states to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. He has since reversed course, vowing to codify the ruling if elected and stating that \u201cwe must fight any and all attempts to overturn it.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Biden once backed the Hyde Amendment that prohibits federal funds from being spent on abortions but announced his support for scrapping it earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without the health care they need,\u201d he said at a June gala hosted by the Democratic National Committee. \u201cIf I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support [the amendment].\u201d\n\nLove HuffPost?
