Bailouts increase the risk of SA Express incurring greater losses and requiring additional and extended financial guarantees by the state; and\n\nRisks the misuse air space which is a valuable national asset.\n\nManson demanded that the council rescind the decision or face court action.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn all the circumstances, Airlink intends to institute an application to have the decision reviewed, set aside and declared invalid in terms of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act and the principle of legality.\n\n\u201cThis letter constitutes notice to the council and SA Express of the intended review application. Airlink will endeavour to launch the review application on or before October 18 2019. Airlink hereby requests that the coming into effect of the decision be suspended, pending the outcome of the review application.\u201d\n\nThe company and the public will suffer immediate and irreparable prejudice if the decision were to be implemented pending the review, Manson said.\n\nIn a terse response on Thursday, the council informed Airlink it would forge ahead and implement the decision to award SA Express scheduled flights to Luanda, Gaborone and Bulawayo.\n\n\u201cThe council takes note of the contents but disagrees with Airlink\u2019s submission that the council ought to have refused the application and further disagrees with the submission that there was no proper basis for the council to conclude that the statutory requirements were satisfied. Council disagrees with the submission that the decision is prejudicial.\n\n\u201cThe council has considered the request that the coming into effect of the decision be suspended, pending the outcome of the review application, and does not agree to the request for the suspension of the decision and therefore the suspension sought is not granted. \u201cThe council reserves its right to vigorously defend its decision and ensure full implementation of the International Air Services Act,\u201d the letter read.\n\nA source with experience in the aviation sector said SA Express\u2019 entire turnaround strategy was premised on getting access to international routes.\n\n\u201cIf they are not able to access international routes, they might just as well shut the door and go home.\n\n\u201cIt means SA Express will look to government for more bailouts. In April Treasury extended a R1.5 bailout to SA Express.\n\n\u201cThose routes would help them save face. If they are not able to fly these routes it means that their turnaround strategy is in peril,\u201d said the source.\n\nIn May last year the SA Civil Aviation Authority grounded SA Express following safety concerns, leaving hundreds of thousands of passengers in the lurch.\n\nThe authority had also withdrawn the airworthiness of nine of SA Express\u2019 aircrafts, meaning that the carrier could no longer operate as an airline.\n\nIt needed to reapply to start operating as an airline and civil aviation authorities had to carry out a full audit before allowing the company to start flying again.\n\nSA Express returned to the air in August only to find that almost all it routes and customers had been snapped up by Airlink.\n\nAviation expert Guy Leitch said it appeared that SA Airlink\u2019s chief executive Rodger Foster was attempting to use the council to eliminate competition.\n\n\u201cIf SA Express is taken off those routes, there will be no competition.\u201d However, he also believed that Foster\u2019s complaint was justifiable.\n\n\u201cFor SA Express to operate and compete fairly, it needs to be solvent, properly capitalised, fly regular schedules and not cancel flights. At the moment the company is not able to do so. It has a bloated structure, no balance sheet, no aircraft and is paying more for leased aircraft.\u201d\n\nAnother aviation expert, who did not want to be named, claimed Foster\u2019s move was an attempt to eliminate competition.\n\nThe expert accused Foster of trying to shut down SA Express by all means necessary.\n\n\u201cHe is fighting the same government that he is part of. The success of SA Airlink is on the back of a franchise agreement, signed more than two decades ago, which allows Rodger to use SAA\u2019s intellectual property. The agreement allows him to use SAA\u2019s property, including marketing, booking systems and counters. SAA owns 3% of SA Airlink. Why is Rodger fighting a government of which he is a part?\u201d\n\nThe source said that the sooner SA Express crashes, the quicker government would incorporate it into SAA.\n\n\u201cRodger would be the biggest beneficiary of the merger of SAA and SA Express in that his company would be the only feeder to the national carrier. It is not a secret that Foster wants the government to take a bigger stake in SA Airlink at a premium determined by him.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with City Press Foster dismissed the claims that he was trying to crash SA Express and eliminate all competition as nonsense.\n\n\u201cThey make it sound as if we don\u2019t want competition, but that is not the essence of the letter. According to the International Services Act, before an airline is considered for routes, certain criteria should be satisfied. That includes safety, and a proper balance sheet. At the moment SA Express is not a going concern, they are not able to table financial statements and as such they don\u2019t meet the critieria.\u201d\n\nThe council did not apply its mind when granting SA Express scheduled routes to Bulawayo, Gaborone and Luanda, he said, adding that the idea that he wants a monopoly was a \u201cnonsensical fabrication\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to compete as long as the competition is fair. It is not fair that SA Express keeps getting government bailouts when everyone else is subjected to market forces.\u201d\n\nOf the franchise agreement he said: \u201cYes, there is a franchise agreement, but SAA benefits immensely from it. We have 55 networks which supply a huge number of passengers to SAA.\u201d", "description": "South Africans might have to fork out hundreds of millions more in bailouts to shore up the government\u2019s bankrupt domestic and regional carrier SA Express.", "authors": ["Sipho Masondo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7023/e8cd59089b8d41d0975fab3f41dfafa5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
