Understand there were 3,000 locals ready to help,\" the post said.\n\nBut Power said police had been on the lookout for members of the public taking spilled beer cans and there had been none.\n\n\"Maybe all the people weren't fans of VB,\" he said.\n\n\"If it had been Reschs there would have been a riot,\" he said, apparently referring to his favourite beer.
