In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: \u201cI think you have to concede that it\u2019s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat \u2026 very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It\u2019s simply not a practical suggestion.\u201d\n\nThe rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.\n\nAnother reader put this into context: \u201cIn the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I\u2019ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.\u201d\n\nTravel can have a magical transformation on individuals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels; to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes; to meet people with different ideas and perspectives; to try out alternative lifestyles; to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes; to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it\u2019s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland\u2019s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world.\n\nBut we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist, John Vidal explored the dilemma that \u201cpeople like me, cursed with loving travel\u201d now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of \u201cflygskam\u201d, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the \u201cflexitarian\u201d diet \u2013 where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely \u2013 to flying.\n\nThe majority of locations we feature in the Guardian\u2019s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.\n\nOur Local\u2019s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We\u2019ve been tapping in to local people\u2019s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.\n\nOn our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example \u2013 rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.\n\nOne of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.\n\nWe still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world\u2019s most ambitious rewilding project.\n\nTourism accounts for one in 10 of the world\u2019s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: \u201cAll around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I\u2019ve met hunters who\u2019ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now diving instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.\u201d\n\nThe Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes \u2013 which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.\n\nJohn Vidal\u2019s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: \u201cI don\u2019t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one \u2026 If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn\u2019t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.\u201d\n\nReturning to that article on Helsinki, there\u2019s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to \u201cflygskam\u201d, and that is \u201ctagskryt\u201d (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: \u201cThe journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.\u201d\n\nBecause, of course, we\u2019ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: \u201cHow many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe \u2013 delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.\u201d\n\nThat is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section.", "description": "Guardian travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprint", "authors": ["Andy Pietrasik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3ffed58f793a5e1abaf51bf8d6c5156e", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
