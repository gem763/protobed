McKinley resigned last week amid worsening morale at the State Department and widespread concern that Pompeo has done little to defend diplomats who became ensnared in efforts by Trump to get Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cf White House directed \u201cthree amigos\u201d to run Ukraine policy, senior State department official tells House investigators.\n\n\u25cf Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney emerges as a key facilitator of the campaign to pressure Ukraine.\n\n\u25cf Testimony exposes deepening discontent with Pompeo at State Department.\n\nAD\n\n4:40 p.m.: Trump called Pelosi a \u2018third-rate politician\u2019 in first encounter between the leaders since impeachment inquiry began, Schumer says\n\nAt their first meeting since the impeachment inquiry began, Trump called Pelosi a \u201cthird-rate politician,\u201d Schumer said.\n\n\u201cHe was insulting, particularly to the speaker. She kept her cool completely. But he called her a third-rate politician. \u2026 It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe not focused on the facts,\u201d Schumer told reporters after the meeting, which focused on Syria and during which impeachment was not discussed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPelosi, who launched the impeachment inquiry three weeks ago, described Trump\u2019s behavior as a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d\n\n4:05 p.m.: Conservative group to air TV ads against Romney\n\nThe Club for Growth, a free-market advocacy group historically focused on fiscal conservatism, has a new TV ad going after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah.).\n\nThe ad calls Romney \u201cslick, slippery, stealthy\u201d and a \u201cDemocrat secret asset\u201d who is \u201cplotting to take down President Trump with impeachment.\u201d\n\nRomney has been more critical of the president over the Ukraine issue than any other congressional Republican, and Trump has fired back angrily.\n\nNotably, the group targeted Trump with attack ads in 2015, warning conservatives that \u201che\u2019s really playing us for chumps.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt the time, Trump called the Club for Growth \u201clittle respected.\u201d\n\n3:30 p.m.: McConnell says he expects Senate to meet six days a week during impeachment trial, beginning around Thanksgiving\n\nAD\n\nMcConnell told Senate Republicans that he expects that the House will vote to impeach Trump and that the Senate trial will probably begin around Thanksgiving, according to a senator who attended.\n\nAt the weekly Senate GOP luncheon, McConnell also fielded questions about the details of the process and told lawmakers that the Senate would probably meet six days a week during the trial, Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a planned expectation that it would be sometime around Thanksgiving, so you\u2019d have basically Thanksgiving to Christmas \u2014 which would be wonderful, because there\u2019s no deadline in the world like the next break to motivate senators,\u201d Cramer said.\n\nAD\n\nHe added that McConnell, his staff and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) fielded \u201cevery question you could imagine\u201d during the luncheon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have to admit I was grateful for the civics lesson, because it\u2019s not something we deal with very often, thank God,\u201d he said.\n\nOne issue that came up, Cramer noted, was the fine line Republican senators walk between criticizing the House-led impeachment inquiry and maintaining neutrality ahead of the likely Senate trial.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, how do we as a conference remain strongly united and open-minded should it come to trial, while at the same time, in the meantime, standing up for obvious injustices between now and then?\u201d Cramer said.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Erica Werner\n\n2 p.m.: Trump claims, without evidence, that Obama was behind 2016 election \u2018corruption\u2019\n\nAt a joint news conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella Wednesday, Trump was asked by an Italian reporter about Attorney General William P. Barr\u2019s meetings with Italian officials.\n\nAD\n\nTrump dodged the question, saying he didn\u2019t know the details. He then pivoted, declaring that there was \u201ca lot of corruption\u201d in the 2016 campaign and accusing former president Barack Obama of being behind it.\n\nNo evidence has emerged to back up Trump\u2019s assertion.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of corruption; maybe it goes right up to President Obama,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI happen to think that it does.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n1:50 p.m.: One Giuliani associate released on bond\n\nOne of two associates of Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani arrested at Dulles International Airport last week has been released on bond, a day before they are both set to appear in federal court in New York on campaign finance violations.\n\nIgor Fruman left the Alexandria federal courthouse with his attorney just before 2 p.m. Wednesday and declined to answer questions about his case.\n\nAD\n\nFruman put up property in Florida worth $1 million to secure his release, according to court records. Lev Parnas, his business partner, remains behind bars. A federal judge in Alexandria agreed to release Parnas if he could offer as collateral a $1 million business. He has not yet done so.\n\nAD\n\nWhere Parnas and Fruman got the money they are accused of illegally pouring into American politics remains a mystery. Parnas paid Giuliani $500,000 as a consultant while helping him drum up support for an investigation into Hunter Biden in Ukraine. But he also owes more than that in a civil suit involving a failed movie project.\n\n\u2014 Rachel Weiner\n\n1 p.m.: \u2018Mr. President, release your tax returns, or shut up,\u2019 Biden says\n\nIn an exchange with reporters in Ohio, Biden faced repeated questions about the actions of his son in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nHe said his son\u2019s comments speak for themselves, then turned the question back to Trump: \u201cMr. President, release your tax returns, or shut up.\u201d\n\n12:45 p.m.: Schumer says Senate Republicans should withhold judgment on Trump\n\nIn remarks on the Senate floor, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Republicans in the chamber to withhold judgment on Trump, given that the Senate may be called upon to act as jurors in a potential impeachment trial.\n\n\u201cWe are several steps away from a potential trial in the Senate,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe House continues to do its work diligently, even-handedly, with only the facts in mind. So I\u2019d remind my Republican colleagues in this chamber that committing, today, to vote \u2018not guilty\u2019 is contrary to their oath to \u2018do impartial justice.\u2019 That\u2019s their oath.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe took particular aim at McConnell and Graham, arguing that they \u201cseem determined to turn this serious inquiry into another partisan exercise.\u201d\n\n12:40: Democrats plan to derail resolution calling for censure of Schiff\n\nDemocrats are expected to vote Thursday to derail a Republican-sponsored resolution to censure Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for his handling of the impeachment inquiry, according to a House Democratic aide.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) is the lead sponsor of the resolution.\n\nRepublicans have taken issue with several aspects of Schiff\u2019s handling of the inquiry, including a statement in a recent hearing in which Schiff included an embellished version of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nSchiff later said his remarks were intended as a parody and that should have been apparent to Trump and other critics.\n\nPelosi has stood by Schiff and Democrats are expected to have the votes to \u201ctable\u201d the resolution, which will prevent a vote on the measure itself.\n\n12:15 p.m.: Perry declines to say whether he will comply with subpoena\n\nIn an appearance on Fox Business Network on Wednesday, Energy Secretary Rick Perry declined to commit about complying with a congressional subpoena.\n\n\u201cHey, listen,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThe House has sent a subpoena over for the records that we have. And our general counsel and the White House counsel are going through the process right now. And I\u2019m going to follow the lead of the, of my counsel on that.\u201d\n\nFriday is the deadline for documents to be released from the White House and Perry. Trump has said Perry asked him to make the July call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but Perry told reporters last week he did it so that the two could talk about energy issues.\n\n11:45 a.m.: Trump says Pelosi has \u2018done this country a tremendous disservice\u2019\n\nHours before they were set to meet face-to-face for the first time since the launch of the impeachment inquiry, Trump told reporters that Pelosi has \u201cdone this country a tremendous disservice.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s created a phony witch hunt, another one,\u201d Trump said of the impeachment inquiry focused on his pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. \u201cThis one is just absolutely crazy. \u2026 This is an open-and-shut simple case.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s comments came during an Oval Office meeting with Italian President Sergio Mattarella. Later Wednesday, Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders, including Pelosi, about the Turkish incursion in Syria.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House, Trump contended Democrats are \u201cdesperate because they know they\u2019re going to lose the election.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re playing games,\u201d he said. \u201cThey figure they can\u2019t win the election, so maybe we can find some ground, somebody that Trump never met, and maybe they\u2019ll say something bad about Trump, and if they do, really bad, maybe it can stick a little bit. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\n11:30 a.m.: \u2018I don\u2019t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani,\u2019 Trump says of Bolton\n\nIn an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office after meeting with Mattarella, Trump claimed he personally got along \u201cpretty well\u201d with his former national security adviser, John Bolton, but suggested that there was friction between Bolton and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.\n\n\u201cLook, John Bolton, I get along well with him,\u201d Trump said when asked whether he was concerned that Democrats may call Bolton to testify in their impeachment inquiry. \u201cI actually got along with him pretty well. It just didn\u2019t work out. \u2026 I don\u2019t know that he got along with Rudy Giuliani.\u201d\n\nTrump defended Giuliani, arguing that he \u201cwas seeking out corruption, and I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with seeking out corruption.\u201d\n\nAccording to two people familiar with the matter, Fiona Hill, the National Security Council\u2019s former top adviser on Russia and Europe, told lawmakers earlier this week that Bolton was infuriated by a shadow operation being conducted by Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on the president\u2019s political rival.\n\nBolton had likened Giuliani to a \u201chand grenade\u201d and had instructed Hill to raise the matter with White House lawyers, the people said.\n\nPressed Wednesday about a Washington Post report that Giuliani had urged Trump to extradite a Turkish cleric living in exile in the United States, the president dismissed the fact that Giuliani had not registered as a foreign lobbyist.\n\n\u201cYou have to ask Rudy those questions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me.\u201d\n\n11:15 a.m.: Fourth defendant in Giuliani associates\u2019 case arrested at New York airport\n\nDavid Correia, the fourth defendant in a campaign finance case involving business associates of President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, was arrested Wednesday morning at a New York City airport, officials said.\n\nCorreia has been charged with participating in a scheme to use foreign money to build political support for a fledgling recreational marijuana business in Nevada and other states, according to an indictment unsealed last week. The indictment also charged Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman with conspiracy and making false statements to election regulators.\n\nThe other three defendants were quickly arrested by the FBI, including Andrey Kukushkin, who is also accused in the alleged scheme. But Correia\u2019s whereabouts have been unclear until Wednesday morning. All four defendants are due to appear in federal court Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cThe defendant was taken into custody by the FBI at JFK earlier this morning,\u201d said Nicholas Biase, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Devlin Barrett\n\n10:45 a.m.: House Republicans accuse Democrats of \u2018Soviet-style tactics\u2019\n\nAt their weekly news conference, House Republican leaders ratcheted up their rhetoric against Democrats, accusing them of \u201cSoviet-style tactics\u201d for holding closed-door depositions \u2014 even though Republican lawmakers have joined Democrats in those depositions.\n\n\u201cWhat is Chairman Schiff trying to hide from the American people?\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said, referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\nRep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) struck a similar note, saying of Schiff: \u201cHe\u2019s taken this to a Soviet-style inquiry.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy argued that Democrats\u2019 handling of the impeachment inquiry suggests they \u201cbelieve you\u2019re guilty until you prove your innocence.\u201d\n\nBut McCarthy also denied that Trump had asked foreign countries to investigate Biden \u2014 even though the president has done so publicly in remarks to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House.\n\n\u201cEvery single day in America, we work with other countries to solve open cases,\u201d McCarthy said, adding that the president \u201cdid nothing wrong.\u201d\n\n10:40 a.m. Jeffries says Republicans are \u2018unable to defend the indefensible\u2019\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), a Pelosi ally in House leadership, on Wednesday defended her resistance to Republican demands to hold a full House vote authorizing the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Jeffries said it was a \u201ctextbook abuse of power\u201d for Trump to have pressed Ukraine to investigate the Bidens at a time when nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid was being withheld.\n\nJeffries said there is nothing in the Constitution, Supreme Court precedent or House rules that requires a vote to launch an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThey are unable to defend the indefensible, so the Republicans are arguing about cosmetic procedural matters,\u201d he said, characterizing Trump\u2019s actions as \u201cabhorrent behavior.\u201d\n\n10 a.m.: Pompeo adviser to decry politicization of State Department in impeachment probe testimony\n\nMcKinley, the former senior adviser to Pompeo until his sudden resignation last week, will tell House impeachment investigators Wednesday that career diplomats were mistreated during his tenure and some had their careers derailed for political reasons, according to a person familiar with his testimony.\n\nMcKinley will outline how his concerns culminated with the recall of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a punitive action he and many other rank-and-file diplomats viewed as wholly unjustified.\n\n\u201cThe unwillingness of State Department leadership to defend Yovanovitch or interfere with an obviously partisan effort to intervene in our relationship with Ukraine for the political benefit of the president was too much for him,\u201d said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be candid.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Carol Morello and John Hudson\n\n9:50 a.m.: McKinley arrives at the Capitol\n\nMcKinley, the former senior adviser to Pompeo, has arrived at the Capitol in advance of a scheduled deposition with House investigators.\n\n9:40 a.m.: Volker arrives at the Capitol to review transcripts of testimony\n\nKurt Volker, the former special representative to Ukraine, has arrived at the Capitol. He is reviewing transcripts of his Oct. 3 testimony, according to a committee aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details that are not public.\n\nVolker previously gave House committees text messages depicting State Department officials apparently coordinating with Giuliani to leverage a public promise of an investigation into the Bidens for a meeting between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s new president.\n\n8:30 a.m.: Trump, Pelosi to see one another for first time since inquiry began\n\nTrump and Pelosi are scheduled to come face-to-face for the first time since the launch of the impeachment inquiry during a meeting at the White House scheduled for 3 p.m. Wednesday about Turkish military aggression in Syria. Trump has invited congressional leaders from both parties.\n\nTrump might get questions earlier in the day about the impeachment inquiry. He is scheduled to hold a joint news conference at noon with visiting Italian President Sergio Mattarella.\n\n7:45 a.m.: Trump suggests he\u2019s facing possible impeachment because the Democratic presidential field is weak\n\nIn a morning tweets, Trump panned the performances of the Democratic presidential candidates in Tuesday night\u2019s debate \u2014 and suggested he is facing an impeachment inquiry because the field is weak.\n\n\u201cYou would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cNow you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!\u201d\n\nHe later predicted dire consequences if any of the Democrats prevail.\n\n\u201cOur record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn another tweet, Trump quoted conservative cable host Graham Ledger calling the impeachment inquiry a \u201cConstitutional Travesty\u201d and said he is the wrong politician to target.\n\n\u201cIt is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!\u201d Trump tweeted, referring to the House Intelligence Committee chairman and the House speaker, both California Democrats. Members of Congress cannot be impeached.\n\nTrump also echoed the arguments of his Republican allies who have spent more time attacking the impeachment process than defending Trump\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n7:30 a.m.: McCarthy ramps up attacks on Pelosi over process\n\nMcCarthy ramped up his attacks Wednesday on Pelosi, arguing that Democrats were treating Trump unfairly during the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a better chance of having a fair judicial system in China than in Speaker Pelosi\u2019s House of Representatives,\u201d McCarthy said during an appearance on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy complained that House investigators are taking depositions behind closed doors, that only Democrats can call witnesses and that Trump does not have a lawyer present to cross-examine witnesses.\n\nDuring the depositions, Republican lawmakers and staff are allowed to question witnesses. Democrats have said that they are conducting depositions behind closed doors so that witnesses cannot tailor their accounts to previous testimony.\n\nEarlier this week, Schiff said he expects some witnesses to testify again in open sessions and said transcripts will be released later.\n\nThe process is consistent with House rules but has differed in some respects from previous impeachment inquiries.\n\n\u201cYou know in America you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty until you let the Democrats become in charge,\u201d McCarthy said during his Fox News interview.\n\n7 a.m.: Former Pompeo adviser to testify about State Department\n\nMcKinley is expected to testify before House investigators leading the impeachment inquiry on Wednesday morning.\n\nHe will come to the Hill with an intimate understanding of how Pompeo wielded power in the highest echelons of the State Department, given his proximity to the top diplomat on his many trips abroad.\n\nThe format for the testimony is a \u201ctranscribed interview,\u201d said a congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss matters not yet made public, which places fewer restrictions on the interview process than in a formal deposition.\n\n\u2014 John Hudson\n\n6:40 a.m.: Trump campaign calls inquiry a \u2018sham\u2019 because of no formal vote\n\nThe Trump campaign seized Wednesday morning on the announcement by Democratic leaders that they still have no plans for a full House vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn morning tweets, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said Democrats were \u201ctrampling all over due process\u201d and called the ongoing inquiry an \u201cillegitimate, unprecedented sham\u201d and an \u201cillegitimate plot to overthrow a duly elected President.\u201d\n\nIn a news conference Tuesday, Pelosi noted that there is no constitutional requirement for a full House vote to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cThere is no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,\u201d Pelosi said.\n\nSchiff told reporters that Republicans are calling for a vote because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to discuss the president\u2019s conduct; they would much rather discuss process.\u201d\n\n6 a.m.: Impeachment first topic in Democratic presidential debate\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was the first topic tackled at Tuesday night\u2019s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) fielded the first question, on why she believes Congress should hold impeachment proceedings rather than leaving the issue of Trump\u2019s fitness for office up to the voters to decide next November.\n\nWarren\u2019s response: \u201cBecause sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics, and I think that\u2019s the case with this impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), too, defended his call for impeaching Trump, adding that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \u201chas got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBiden \u2014 who only recently came out in favor of impeachment \u2014 called Trump the most corrupt U.S. president in history. He highlighted the White House\u2019s efforts to stonewall the impeachment inquiry. \u201cThey have no choice but to move,\u201d he said of House Democrats.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) echoed her competitors, expressing her support of the impeachment inquiry and adding that she didn\u2019t think the impeachment process would take very long.", "description": "The president\u2019s comments came hours before he was scheduled to come face-to-face with the House speaker for the first time since the launch of the Democrat-led impeachment inquiry.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/p3NFVVh74gveUA8LJZjprssO74g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EFR4VFXPR4I6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
