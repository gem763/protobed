She woke the next morning and took herself to hospital, telling doctors: \u201cI\u2019m weak and I\u2019m blue.\u201d\n\nThe woman was what doctors call cyanotic \u2013 the medical term for seeming to have blueish skin or nails.\n\nDr Otis Warren, the emergency room doctor on duty at Miriam hospital in Providence, the state capital, diagnosed the problem as \u201cacquired methemoglobinemia\u201d \u2013 a rare blood disorder that causes people to produce an unusual amount of methemoglobin (a type of hemoglobin). With methemoglobinemia, the hemoglobin can carry oxygen, but cannot release it effectively to tissues, according to the National Library of Medicine.\n\nWarren had seen one case previously in a patient who was being treated with an antibiotic. \u201cThe skin color looked exactly the same,\u201d Warren told NBC News. \u201cYou see it once, and it stays in your mind.\u201d\n\nWarren said the condition had been triggered by a numbing agent containing benzocaine. The woman told Warren she hadn\u2019t used the entire bottle though it was apparent, Warren said, she\u2019d \u201cused a whole lot of it\u201d.\n\nThe woman was treated with an antidote, methylene blue, and within minutes reported feeling better. She was given a second dose and spent the night in the hospital for observation before being sent home the next morning \u2013 with a note to go to the dentist.\n\nWarren said the case spurred him to advise people to take care when using benzocaine. He said: \u201cPeople have no idea that something very specific and very dangerous can happen. It is not a mild side effect.\u201d", "description": "Woman, 25, diagnosed with methemoglobinemia as doctors say numbing agent for toothache that contained benzocaine to blame", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccfb054f5eda33614a730e0462b53bd254e56870/0_38_1286_772/master/1286.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d5c4eebdbacdb317fbbf73bf43c318f6", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
