Mama, phone.\"\n\nIsabella handed it over and thought nothing more of it until a few days later when she received a notification informing her that her sofa was on its way.\n\n(Image: NBC San Diego)\n\nShocked, the mum first thought she had bought the furniture in her sleep before remembering she had given her eldest daughter the phone and access to the open Amazon app.\n\nThe toddler had unwittingly pressed the 1-click buy it now button and just like that, a new three-piece tufted grey sofa was theirs, as reported by NBC San Diego .\n\nPanicking, Isabella quickly began trying to figure out how to cancel the order - but it was too late.\n\nIn true scarily-efficient Amazon style, the sofa turned up on her doorstep packed in a big cardboard box.\n\n(Image: NBC San Diego)\n\nAs little Rayna inspected her first big purchase, her mum was learning that there were fees for both restocking the piece of furniture and shipping it back to Amazon, which amounted to just under \u00a3150.\n\nReluctant to cough up the huge sum, Isabella went online to try and resell the couch at a smaller loss.\n\nHer listing read: \"Brand new in box. Ordered it by mistake, my toddler actually did\u2026darn buy with 1 click on Amazon. Anyway, it\u2019s more of a hassle to ship back, so I\u2019ll take a loss.\"\n\n(Image: NBC San Diego)\n\nLuckily, Amazon kindly offered her a full refund, and even gave her the option of keeping the sofa or donating it.\n\nThey also informed her the 1-click feature on her account had been disabled.\n\nNow being able to appreciate the funny side of the story, Isabella hoped her experience would act as a warning for other parents who hand over their phones to keep the little ones happy.\n\n\"Make sure all of the apps are closed,\" she said. \"Make sure your passwords are fingerprint-locked, make sure they don\u2019t know your number password, because kids are a lot smarter than we think.\"\n\nAs for Rayna's taste in furnishings, her mum joked it proved she had an eye for design but may need to work on her bargain hunting skills, adding: \u201cIt cost a lot more than I would ever pay for a couch.\"", "description": "Mum-of-two Isabella had no idea what had happened until she was told her three-piece sofa was on its way", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Nbc San Diego"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20545012.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Phone.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
