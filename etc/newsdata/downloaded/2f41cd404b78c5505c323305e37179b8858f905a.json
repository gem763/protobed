I would tell guys when I came there, like, I still feel like they are living on that Super Bowl high,\u201d Scandrick said Friday on Fox Sports 1. \u201cLike, it\u2019s over. You\u2019re living in the past. But some of those guys came into the league and the first thing they experienced was 13-3 and the Super Bowl, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think they\u2019re having a tough time dealing with success. Whenever you\u2019ve got to say \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to get it together,\u2019 \u2018Oh, no one believes in us,\u2019 \u2018Oh, it\u2019s about us.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 defeat against their hated divisional rivals in Dallas came on the heels of a 38-20 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, marking only the fourth time in more than four decades the Eagles have lost consecutive games by 18 or more points. They are 3-4 and only one game behind the first-place Cowboys in the NFC East, but their losing streak has been underpinned by rumors of locker room turmoil.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say, where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 32-year-old Scandrick joined the Eagles in July, was released before the start of the season but re-signed last month and appeared in three games. He recorded a pair of strip sacks and returned a fumble for a touchdown against the New York Jets on his debut, but found himself on the breadlines after the Minnesota and Dallas debacles in a move he said \u201cfelt kind of scapegoat-ish\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe problem in Philadelphia is much, much bigger than me,\u201d Scandrick said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe anything that (general manager Howie Roseman) says. Howie is one of those people that if they told me it was raining outside, I\u2019d probably gets some shorts just in case. He put it to me as they wanted to play younger players, they\u2019re a mess on defense and they need to get more defensive linemen, so we\u2019ll see how that works for them up in Buffalo.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThere are some accountability issues there and it starts from the top.\u201d", "description": "Veteran cornerback Orlando Scandrick delivered a withering assessment of the reeling Philadelphia Eagles during a television appearance on Friday", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7700cd2e5c6aa9e1894094622132944d2e9f06f1/0_20_3361_2017/master/3361.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c8b9f6147a1d70d9dd0bbbce329b4d4", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
