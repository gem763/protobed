Then you may want to check out Icelolly's latest deal on Riga in Latvia.\n\nThat's because the holiday deals comparison site currently has two-night breaks in Riga from \u00a359pp - including your hotel and return flights.\n\nIn fact you'll be staying at the 4* Rixwell Gertrude Hotel on a bed and breakfast basis, and the hotel boasts an enviable location in the city centre so it's the ideal base if you want to go exploring.\n\nThe deal is valid on stays throughout January 2020 and you can already book on the Icelolly website although it's worth noting that the cheapest rates are subject to availability.\n\nThe price is based on two adults sharing either a double or a twin room. It's worth noting that the return flights are from London Stansted, so if you choose an alternative airport then the price of the package may vary.\n\nThere's good news if you're planning on travelling with your children, as kids aged 2 to 11 years can stay FREE at the hotel too! Ideal if you've got little ones and you're not tied to the school holiday dates.\n\nJanuary can be a great time to visit Riga, and not just because of the deal; there's a reason it's hailed as one of the best value city breaks in January .\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIt's possible to get plenty of bang for your buck from the cheap sightseeing opportunities to the local restaurants serving up hearty and delicious meals that won't break the bank.\n\nThere's plenty to see and do in Riga too.\n\nFor a start the city is filled with breathtaking buildings from the iconic House of the Blackheads to St Peter's Church, while the Riga Central Market, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is well worth a visit if only for the vibrant atmosphere (although it can be ideal for picking up a souvenir or two!).\n\nMake sure to leave space on the itinerary to wander through Riga's Old Town, where the eye-catching architecture and charming boutiques can make for a memorable afternoon.", "description": "Cheap Riga city breaks are up for grabs from \u00a359pp on Icelolly which include a 4* hotel stay, return flights and breakfast", "authors": ["Julie Delahaye", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20692933.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Blackheads-house-in-the-old-town-of-Riga-Latvia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
