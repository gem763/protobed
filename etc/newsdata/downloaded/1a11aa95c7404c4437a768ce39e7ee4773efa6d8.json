That's what we do here. I spent my morning combing through Amazon's Gold Box page, plus researching price drops on products our team has reviewed and loved, to figure out what the top highlights for deals are today. With further ado, here are my five favorite deals happening on Amazon this Friday.\n\n1. Lowest price alert: This super-popular down alternative comforter\n\nSweet dreams and sweet savings. (Photo: Utopia Bedding)\n\nLooking for a new comforter to replace the one you have at home? This incredibly popular down comforter is a great option, especially if you're shopping on a budget. This one from Utopia Bedding, which I have at home myself and really like for the price, is priced at just under $20 (and goes up based on size), which is the lowest price we've ever seen for it. Between me and the more than 3,500 reviewers who absolutely love it, you can definitely trust you'll love this comforter.\n\nGet the Utopia Bedding Down Alternative Comforter for $18.69-$26.99 (Save $3.31-$6)\n\n2. Under $150: The best wireless earbuds you can buy right now\n\nYour ears are gonna love these AirPods. (Photo: Reviewed.com/TJ Donegan & Apple)\n\nApple Airpods are basically everywhere right now, which have given way to all kinds of jokes and memes. But the thing is, they really do offer superior sound and comfort. In fact, our tester was actually upset by how much he liked them. This model is an upgrade over the previously released Airpods, and offers over 24 hours of listening time, probably from using the charging case to recharge the earbuds between uses. You can also spring for the ones with the wireless charging case for $170 (a $30 discount from its original price). Either way you go, you won't regret grabbing a set of these.\n\nGet the latest-model Apple Airpods on Amazon for $144.99 (Save $15)\n\n3. Under $25: Our favorite personal blender for making smoothies\n\nThe silkiest smoothies we've ever tasted. (Photo: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar)\n\nIf you've been searching for a blender that's basic, easy to use, but still chops, mixes, blends, whips, and grinds the way you need, this 11-piece Magic Bullet blender could be an awesome pick up today. Ideal for single-serve drinks and especially for smoothies, we loved this in testing and found that it consistently made the silkiest smoothies of all the personal blenders we used. This usually goes for about $30, but you can save an extra $6 thanks to an on-page coupon, plus you can get tons of accessories with this one, which makes it really worthwhile.\n\nGet the Magic Bullet Blender 11-Piece Set for $23.99 (Save $6)\n\n4. Only $10: This cute as hell waffle iron that's awesome for fall\n\nThis waffle maker will help you get in the autumnal spirit. (Photo: Dash)\n\nCould this little waffle iron be any more perfect for fall? I think not. Whether you're all about weekend brunch or you're someone like me who almost never makes breakfast at home, the Dash Mini Pumpkin Maker Waffle Iron makes breakfast fun. Since it's pumpkin-shaped, this waffle iron (which usually goes for around $15) is especially great for the fall season.\n\nGet the Dash Pumkin Mini Waffle Maker Machine for $9.99 (Save $5)\n\n5. Best price yet: An affordable robot vacuum that we love\n\nGet an inexpensive 'bot to do your dirty work. (Photo: Eufy)\n\nEveryone hates vacuuming, but it has to get done.

Right now, you can get the upgraded version of our favorite affordable robot vacuum for its lowest price with the on-page coupon and code EUFYROBOVAC. We already love the Eufy RoboVac 11S for its great cleaning power and reasonable price, but the newer 11S Max has been fitted with stronger suction, so you can assure no crumb will be missed.\n\nGet the Eufy RoboVac 11S for $185.99 (Save $54) with the on-page coupon and code EUFYROBOVAC\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
