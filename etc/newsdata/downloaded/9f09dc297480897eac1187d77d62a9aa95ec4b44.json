For that reason, analysts expect 19% growth in Google\u2019s sales to $40.3 billion in the and about the same growth for the current fiscal year.\n\nBut the high level of scrutiny means that a slight miss in Alphabet\u2019s revenue performance could cause a big negative move in its shares. Its stock closed on Friday at $1,264.30, having gained 13% this year. The shares have been under pressure for most of this year on concerns that higher spending could hurt the bottom-line.\n\nAlphabet Weekly Chart\n\nAlphabet and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ) are among the companies being examined in the U.S. Justice Department's broad antitrust review into whether the world\u2019s biggest technology firms are stifling competition.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim said at a Wall Street Journal tech conference this month that a breakup of a tech company is \u201cperfectly on the table\u201d if justified by the evidence uncovered in the probe.\n\nSeparately, the attorneys general of 48 U.S. states, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. congressional committees and Europe\u2019s anti-monopoly authority are also investigating Alphabet and other tech giants.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Wide Moat\n\nThis is not the first time Google is facing antitrust investigations. It dealt with a long federal inquiry that ended in 2013 without significant damage to the company. This time, however, the size and scope of these probes is large enough to create panic among investors and uncertainty for its shares.\n\nThe question for investors is whether they should continue to focus on the company\u2019s business fundamentals or start taking into account a potential adverse outcome of these probes, which could take years to complete.\n\nIn our view, Google is a company with a strong moat that is almost impossible to challenge. More than 90% of all internet searches take place through Google and its company subsidiary YouTube. Every day, Google processes 3.5 billion searches that make its platform the most valuable for advertisers.\n\nThat means companies have little choice but to advertise on Google's platform. Because of its huge internet presence, the mammoth search engine dominates the digital advertising market with a 40% control of the market globally.\n\nIt\u2019s almost impossible to predict the outcome of these regulatory probes and their impact on Google's business, but if history offers any clue, such probes usually end up with a large fine, and impose changes to the company\u2019s internal practices. Google has dealt with both in Europe recently, without losing its market share there.\n\nThe company, with its strong financial muscle, is at the forefront of new technology innovations that will fuel future growth and could help diversify its revenue away from ad business. In particular, self-driving car technology presents the greatest opportunity of all for Alphabet.\n\nAccording to a recent note by Deutsche Bank analysts, Alphabet\u2019s cloud business alone is now worth $225 billion. The unit could report compound annual growth of 55% between 2018 and 2022, and reach annual sales of about $38 billion by 2025, the analysts wrote.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGoogle has the financial power and future growth strategy to deal with any upcoming challenges from regulatory actions and increased competition. The noise created by the latest antitrust probes, in our view, shouldn\u2019t detract investors from what it has to offer. With its traditional growth drivers remaining unchallenged and the company positioning itself to grab a major share of new growth areas, it\u2019s a no-brainer to stick with your Alphabet holdings.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Alphabet Inc Class A, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc Class C.
