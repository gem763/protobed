(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)\n\nMLB umpire Joe West is suing retired catcher Paul Lo Duca for defamation after Lo Duca claimed that West accepted bribes from pitcher Billy Wagner.\n\nLo Duca made the comments back in April on a podcast, alleging that Wagner got a more favorable strike zone from West in exchange for letting him drive his vintage car. \u201cSo, it was 06 or 07, and we\u2019re playing like a really tight game against the Phillies,\u201d he said. \u201cBilly Wagner comes in from the bullpen, and I used to go to the mound every time and, like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Hey, Joe\u2019s behind the plate, set a couple more inches inside.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Are you kidding me? Joe hates me.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018No no no no no no, Joe loves me.\u2019 I go, \u2018He hasn\u2019t given us the corner all day.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019 He literally throws 10 pitches and strikes out three guys; Joe rings up all three guys; eight out of the nine pitches were at least three to four inches inside, not even close. Guys were throwing bats and everything, Joe walks off the field. We get back into the clubhouse, and I\u2019m like, \u2018What the fuck just happened just right now?\u2019 And Wagner just winks at me, I\u2019m like, \u2018What\u2019s the secret?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Eh, Joe loves antique cars, so every time he comes in town I lend him my \u201857 Chevy so he can drive it around, so then he opens up the strike zone for me.'\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit filed by West in New York on Tuesday (Oct. 22) denies that West ever borrowed a car from Wagner and points out that the game Lo Duca described never actually happened.\n\n\u201cIn reality, during 2006 and 2007, the two years that Lo Duca played for the New York Mets with Billy Wagner, Joe West was the home plate umpire for a game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Mets only once, Billy Wagner did not pitch at all, and the game ended on a home run, not on called strikes,\u201d the suit reads.\n\nWest also debunked another of Lo Duca\u2019s claims \u2014 that he was responsible for \u201ceight or nine\u201d of the catcher\u2019s 15 career ejections \u2014 by pointing out that Lo Duca was only ejected from eight games in his 11-year career, and West was only responsible for one of those eight. He is suing for \u201cunspecified damages.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Deadspin", "description": "MLB umpire Joe West is suing retired catcher Paul Lo Duca for defamation after Lo Duca claimed West accepted bribes from Billy Wagner.", "authors": ["Bonnie Stiernberg"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1052426684.jpg?fit=1024%2C682", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
