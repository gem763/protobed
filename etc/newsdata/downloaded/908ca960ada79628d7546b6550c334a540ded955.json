Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.\n\nLet\u2019s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:\n\nSmonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It\u2019s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other\u2019s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning\u2026 Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.\n\nDeath in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a \u201cmajor shout-out for the British Library\u2019s crime series\u201d:\n\nJust a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.\n\nMy Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:\n\nThere were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn\u2019t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.\n\nJG Farrell\u2019s Singapore Grip is \u201cmarvellous, as you would expect from this author,\u201d writes SydneyH:\n\nThe main thing I\u2019ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it \u2013 though there obviously wasn\u2019t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America\u2019s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn\u2019t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn\u2019t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it\u2019s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.\n\nPseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:\n\n\u2026 A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has \u2018taken\u2019. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I\u2019m not far enough into it to talk about it\u2019s meaning, etc, but so far it\u2019s entertaining and thoughtful.\n\nWe Don\u2019t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:\n\nA lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.\n\nVasily Grossman\u2019s Stalingrad is \u201cvery long\u201d says paulburns, but that \u201cdoesn\u2019t matter\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various individuals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I\u2019m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.\n\nFinally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:\n\nIt\u2019s not as dark than others of hers I\u2019ve read, which may be because it\u2019s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there\u2019s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?\n\nNow I want to know too.\n\nInteresting links about books and reading\n\nIf you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #GuardianBooks, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.
