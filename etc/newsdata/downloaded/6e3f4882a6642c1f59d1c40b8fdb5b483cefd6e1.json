But Harris announced late Friday that she would be skipping the event and in a statement accused organizers of \u201cpapering over\u201d Trump\u2019s record of \u201cdecades of celebrating mass incarceration, pushing the death penalty for innocent Black Americans, rolling back police accountability measures and racist behavior that puts people\u2019s lives at risk.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a lawless President. Not only does he circumvent the laws of our country and the principles of our Constitution, but there is nothing in his career that is about justice, for justice, or in celebration of justice,\u201d Harris said.\n\nHarris also took issue with the White House\u2019s inviting only 10 students of the college to attend Trump\u2019s speech and filling the audience with his supporters. Classes were canceled and the students on campus were encouraged to stay in their dorms while Trump was there.\n\nThen, on Saturday afternoon, in the midst of the forum, Harris said the college dropped the event\u2019s sponsor, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, and opened the event to the larger student body.\n\nAD\n\nIn the announcement reversing her boycott, Harris included a statement from one of the forum\u2019s organizers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am excited to welcome presidential candidates to a criminal justice forum dialogue which will allow Benedict College students and the wider community to have full participation,\u201d said Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin. \u201cI want to be clear that the Candidate Forums are hosted by myself and Benedict College.\u201d That part of the weekend was not a 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center event, he said.\n\nBut the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center continued to tweet about the event Saturday, sharing several photos of Harris speaking. And outside the auditorium where the event was being held, it was unclear what changes might have been made to reflect the supposed removal of group as a sponsor.\n\nAD\n\nNo banners displayed the group\u2019s name. Volunteers for the event wore purple and yellow shirts that read \u201cBC VOICE BC VOTE\u201d \u2014 short for Benedict College.\n\nAD\n\nThe only external evidence of sponsorship was a typed note on one of the doors advising attendees that entering the area meant they could be photographed or filmed for \u201c2020 Bipartisan Justice Center marketing material.\u201d\n\nThe Harris campaign and the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neither did the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nInstead of attending the forum, Harris had planned to hold a separate community discussion on criminal justice reform \u2014 an issue that has been politically fraught for her, given her background as San Francisco\u2019s district attorney and as California attorney general. Though Harris argues that her record makes her uniquely qualified to address the systemic problems, her critics say she was once part of the problem.\n\nAD\n\nAt the event Saturday, Harris said she was upset that Trump had been honored.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that Donald Trump would be given an award as it related to criminal justice reform,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is somebody that has disrespected the voices that have been present for decades for criminal justice reform. The people that have sacrificed to create justice in this system.\u201d\n\nNone of the other Democratic presidential candidates invited to the forum had planned to skip it.\n\nAfter Harris initially dropped out, Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a leading voice on criminal justice reform in the Senate, tweeted, \u201cI saw what happened today. And I, for one, will be there tomorrow. I have some things I think they need to hear from me \u2014 directly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOn Saturday morning, Booker also criticized the event for giving Trump \u201ca platform unchecked for close to an hour\u201d and for allowing \u201chim to create some illusion of support from this community when, in fact, he excluded it.\u201d\u2019\n\nAD\n\nHannah Burton, a sophomore at Benedict College, said the president\u2019s visit disrupted activities on campus all week.\n\nOn Thursday, some classes were canceled and the cafeteria was closed. On Friday, the day Trump was on campus, most students were told to stay in their dorms and avoid walking around campus.\n\nBurton and others who lived in dorms near the building where the president spoke were told they couldn\u2019t be in their dorms at all on Friday morning. Most of her classmates went home for the weekend to avoid the chaos, she said.\n\nAD\n\nTrump addressed the forum Friday and received the Bipartisan Justice Award for signing into law the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that eased mandatory minimums for drug offenses, increased the time that could be shaved from a prisoner\u2019s sentence for good behavior and increased access to post-incarceration rehabilitation services to curb recidivism.\n\nAD\n\nUnlike the Democrats, who took questions from the audience, Trump gave a winding speech for more than an hour to a crowd largely consisting of his supporters, who chanted \u201cfour more years\u201d as he spoke about how he, not the Democrats, was the best choice to lift up African Americans.\n\n\u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve been committed to advancing fairness and opportunity for the African American community,\u201d Trump said.\n\nAD\n\nHe also sought to relate to their challenges with the criminal justice system by likening it to the investigations he has faced.\n\n\u201cYou know that, you see what\u2019s going on with the witch hunt. It\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s going on in our country. No crimes there; it\u2019s an investigation in search of a crime,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut in America, you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty, and we don\u2019t have investigations in search of that crime.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump slammed Harris on Saturday morning over her announcement that she would cancel her appearance.\n\n\u201cBadly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I received a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will greatly help the African American community (and all other communities), and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nHarris hit back on Twitter, writing, \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve fought for justice and for the people \u2014 something you\u2019d know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the \u2018criminal\u2019 part.\u201d\n\nCleve R.
