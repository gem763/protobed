That amounts to roughly 5% of the world's total daily crude oil production.\n\nInterested in Iran? Add Iran as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Iran news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nState-run oil company Aramco said in a statement that work was underway to restore production.\n\nThe U.S. has blamed Iran for launching nearly a dozen cruise missiles and over 20 drones from its territory into a key Saudi oil facility on Saturday. Saudi authorities said the weapons were Iranian, but stopped short of blaming Iran directly for the attack.\n\nValidated UGC via AP\n\nThe Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen claimed responsibility for the assault, which hit one of the world's largest oil processing facilities, hundreds of miles from the Yemen-Saudi border, and sharply impacted global oil supplies.\n\nBut a senior U.S. official told ABC News that was false: \"It was Iran. The Houthis are claiming credit for something they did not do.\"\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo first blamed Iran on Saturday, tweeting that there was \"no evidence the attacks came from Yemen.\"\n\nIran has denied responsibility for the attack, accusing Pompeo of \"max deceit,\" as the country's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted Saturday.\n\nBrent Crude, which is used primarily as a reference price benchmark for buying and selling oil in Europe and the Middle East, gained around 20% as trading opened Monday, before stabling around 10% as the day continued. The U.S. benchmark, West Texas intermediate crude, jumped around 10%, according to the AP.\n\nNASA Worldview via AP\n\nIn terms of gross peak supply loss in millions of barrels of crude today, the suspension of 5.7 million is the largest on record, according to the International Energy Agency. The last disruption of a comparable size came in 1978-9 during the Iranian Revolution, when the production of 5.6 million barrels of crude were suspended today.\n\nF. Duckett/AP\n\nDr Val\u00e9rie Marcel, an associate fellow of Energy, Environment and Resources at think tank Chatham House, told ABC News said the main immediate significance of the attack was \u201ccutting Saudi Arabian production in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe immediate issue is getting supplies to the customers that are expecting their crude deliveries, and so Aramco is taking measures to be able to meet demand,\u201d she said. \u201cThe economic expectations for the country, really it depends completely on the timeline. How long will this disruption last?\u201d\n\nAramco drone attack:\n\n5mnbd off the market - 6% of produced crude - but the factor no one is talking about is time. How long will this disruption last? How quickly can the Abqaiq processing facility be brought back online? Is this a 24 hours disruption? \u2014 Val\u00e9rie Marcel (@ValerieMarcel) September 14, 2019\n\nThe stabilization of oil prices a few hours after the market opened means that currently there is \u201cnot a huge concern\u201d of the price having an impact on important global economies, she said, but if the disruption were to last several weeks, that could change.\n\nHamad I Mohammed/Reuters\n\nMeanwhile, the international community has moved to condemn the attacks on the Saudi oil facilities.\n\n\u201cJust spoke to @SecPompeo about this egregious attack on the security of Saudi Arabia,\u201d the U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab tweeted on Sunday. \u201cThis was a reckless attempt to damage regional security and disrupt global oil supplies. The UK condemns such behaviour unreservedly.\u201d\n\nRussia has also condemned the attacks, but warned the U.S. against retaliatory strikes on Iran, after President Trump said the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe decisively condemn the strikes on non-military targets\u201d and \u201cthe negative consequences arising from this for the world economy,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \u201cWe firmly recommend against not rushing to any conclusions about who committed this attack on the Saudi oil refineries. We consider it counterproductive to use this event for the inflaming of passions around Iran along the well-known lines of the U.S. And even more unacceptable are the options that are being presented, the envisaged retaliatory strikes which are allegedly being discussed at the present time in Washington.\u201d", "description": "The attack suspended the production of 5.7 million barrels of oil per day", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/saudi-oil-attack-mo_hpMain_20190915-210739_16x9_992.jpg"}
