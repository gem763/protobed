Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George addresses the National Association for Business Economics in Denver\n\nBy Ann Saphir\n\nDENVER (Reuters) - Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Esther George on Sunday rejected the notion that the U.S. central bank should cut interest rates to try to boost low inflation, adding that doing so could create financial imbalances.\n\n\"In current circumstances, concern about low inflation seems unnecessary,\" George said in remarks prepared for delivery to the National Association for Business Economics. \"In the absence of more evidence that the downside risks may be realized, muted inflation alone would not warrant a policy response.\"\n\nIn fact, she said, hitting the Fed's 2% inflation target spot on is difficult, in part because global factors are in large part responsible for low U.S. inflation, she said.\n\n\"I find it more realistic to accept that there will be both temporary and persistent fluctuations around this long-run target and, as long as they don\u2019t exceed a reasonable threshold \u2014 perhaps as big as 50 or even 100 basis points \u2014 they should be tolerated, depending on broader economic conditions,\" she said.\n\nThat view is at odds with concern expressed by much of the Fed leadership over years of missing the central bank's 2% inflation goal.\n\nGeorge dissented on both of the Fed's interest rate cuts this year, in July and September, to a current target range of 1.75% to 2.00%.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has described those reductions as an insurance policy against the effects of slowing global growth and rising trade uncertainty and says the broader economy is fundamentally \"in a good place.\"\n\n\"Should incoming data point to a broadly weaker economy, adjusting policy may be appropriate to achieve the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandates for maximum sustainable employment and stable prices,\" George said. But with inflation currently very close to the Fed's goal, she said, \"trying to quickly return inflation to 2 percent by adjusting interest rates could require aggressive actions that would misallocate resources and create financial imbalances.\"", "description": "Low inflation?
