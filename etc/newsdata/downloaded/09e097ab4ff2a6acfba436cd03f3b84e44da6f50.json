Featuring striking geometric designs, positive affirmations and colourful bricks, they reveal that attractive floors can appear in some pretty unlikely places \u2013 such as this one in Dallas/Fort Worth international airport.\n\nThe craze started one night in a bar in Amsterdam when work friends Edith Beurskens, Josha Jansen and Pien van Wijmen discovered they had something in common: they all enjoyed sharing pictures of their feet on attractive floors on Instagram.
