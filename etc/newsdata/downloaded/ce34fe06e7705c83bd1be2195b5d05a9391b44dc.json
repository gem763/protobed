You\u2019ve got Jesse played in his position.\n\n\u201cInjuries have made us go into this position but it\u2019s working quite well.\u201d\n\nUnited are working hard to improve that injury situation and the return of Martial is a welcome shot in the arm \u2013 especially as he could work well in the front two with Marcus Rashford in this system.\n\n\u201cThat could happen, definitely,\u201d Solskjaer said.\n\n\u201cI thought Marcus and Dan James caused Liverpool problems, so it depends on who\u2019s fit.\n\n\u201cMason (Greenwood) could have played today as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking more dangerous up front with two at the moment.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer did, though, admit on the eve of the Partizan game that United lack a sharpshooter like Tottenham star Harry Kane.\n\nHours after that Erling Haaland, a player Solskjaer worked with at Molde, underlined his credentials, with the Red Bull Salzburg striker taking his Champions League tally to six goals in his first three appearances.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the time now for me to talk about other strikers, other team\u2019s strikers,\u201d Solskjaer added.\n\n\u201cI spoke about Harry Kane yesterday and Erling today, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for me.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer accepts Manchester United are lacking creativity in midfield but believes Anthony Martial\u2019s return will improve a team who are already benefiting from the switch to a back three.
