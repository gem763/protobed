This was vetted through lawyers. I want to know who wrote this.\u201d\n\nDemocrats maintain that it was an impeachable offense for Mr. Trump, while on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to broach the subject of an abandoned investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s ties to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nIn a transcript of the call released by the White House, Mr. Trump said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about [former Vice President Joseph R.] Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great. Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution. See if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division determined that no campaign finance laws were violated during the call.\n\n\n\nMr. Levin said the whistleblower complaint could be \u201c1,000 times worse\u201d than Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call.\n\n\u201cIn the New York Times today \u2014 which, of course, runs cover for the Democrats and goes after the president of the United States \u2014 they say today that this man\u2019s lawyer \u2014 who, by the way, worked for Schumer and Clinton \u2014 doesn\u2019t want the identity of this man known,\u201d Mr. Levin said. \u201cToo bad, pal. Too late. You want to impeach our president using this BS.\n\n\u201cThis guy files [a complaint],\u201d the \u201cLife, Liberty & Levin\u201d host added. \u201cThis guy\u2019s represented by Democrats. I want to know if Adam Schiff, the Democrat staffers or any of the Democrats were involved in orchestrating this. This leak and coup campaign. Did it in Russia, did it with Kavanaugh, it\u2019s the same damn thing. This is a rogue CIA agent. People might say, but it\u2019s the CIA. Look what they did to the FBI. Look at this guy [former CIA Director John O.] Brennan, a complete reprobate.\u201d\n\nThe president shared Mr. Levin\u2019s commentary on his Twitter account Friday with a follow-up tweet on the matter, saying, \u201cI am draining the swamp!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
