It is due to clarify its official guidance on trans women later this year.\n\nThe controversy comes as male-born trans athletes dominate some women's sport, including Canadian cyclist Rachel McKinnon (pictured), who won a second world title in Manchester last weekend\n\nThe controversy comes as male-born trans athletes dominate some women's sport, including Canadian cyclist Rachel McKinnon, who won a second world title in Manchester last weekend.\n\nOne training document produced by Gendered Intelligence \u2013 and seen by The Mail on Sunday \u2013 urges sporting bodies to 'challenge' the idea that trans women who were born male have an 'unfair advantage' when they compete against biological women.\n\nAt present, trans women must undergo tests to prove they have been taking hormone-blocking drugs to reduce their testosterone levels before competing in women's sport.\n\nBut the document, entitled 'A Social Inclusion Model for Trans People in Sport', asks: 'Why are we worrying about what medical intervention they may or may not have had? They are a woman, within women's parameters.'\n\nGendered Intelligence has previously been criticised for running trans-awareness school workshops for pupils aged as young as four.\n\nBarrister is being investigated by her chambers over tweets she posted about a fight-back against 'gender extremism' Allison Bailey declared her support for the LGB Alliance A barrister is being investigated by her chambers over tweets that she posted about celebrating a fight-back against 'gender extremism'. Allison Bailey declared her support for the LGB Alliance, a new lesbian, gay and bisexual group criticised for excluding the transgender community. Ms Bailey, of Garden Court Chambers in London, tweeted: 'Gender extremism is about to meet its match.' The group consists of former members of the LGBT+ charity Stonewall in protest against its transgender stance. A spokesman for Garden Court said: 'We are investigating concerns raised about Allison Bailey's comments in line with our complaints policy and Bar Standards Board policies.'\n\nDr Nicola Williams, from the women's rights pressure group Fair Play For Women, said: 'Sport England has not yet finalised its guidance on transgender inclusion but is already sneaking it out.'\n\nGendered Intelligence, which registered as a charity earlier this year, claims to have delivered trans training sessions to more than 16,000 people.\n\nIts sport seminars, which have been running since April, claim there is an 'irrational fear' of biological males pretending to be trans women to cheat in sport.\n\nIt adds that sports need to move from an 'exclusive' model where trans athletes have to provide medical evidence before competing in their chosen gender category to an 'inclusive' model that 'assumes everyone can play unless there is a clear, objective reason for them to be excluded'.\n\nCathy Devine, a specialist in sport policy for women, said the advice delivered by Gendered Intelligence may be in breach of the law.\n\nShe said: 'The Equality Act says that people with the protected characteristic of \"gender reassignment\" can be excluded from female sport categories for the purposes of fairness and safety.'\n\nA number of athletes have expressed concerns about the inclusion of trans women athletes, arguing it is unfair to other competitors.\n\nBritish cyclist Victoria Hood said: 'The science is clear and it's obvious to anyone that trans women have an advantage over women.\n\n'All of the governing bodies are terrified of a small, aggressive group of people. For taxpayers to be paying for these training sessions is ludicrous.'\n\nA spokesman for Sport England said: 'Sport England is committed to ensuring that everyone can benefit from the benefits that leading an active life can offer. That's why we have been working with Gendered Intelligence since April to support the sector to be better equipped to include trans people.'\n\nGendered Intelligence said: 'The training we have delivered will allow more trans and non-binary people to access grassroots sports and fitness.'", "description": "At present, trans women must undergo tests to prove they have been taking hormone-blocking drugs to reduce their testosterone levels but this could soon be stopped.", "authors": ["Michael Powell And Sanchez Manning For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/23/20228576-0-image-a-256_1572130171088.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
