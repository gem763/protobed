(Picture: ABC News)\n\nA couple was astonished to find grass and more than 200 walnuts stored under the hood of their SUV by squirrels preparing for winter.\n\nIn fact, Chris Persic, who owns the car, said the squirrels appeared to have stored enough to last them the next three winters.\n\nChris Persic, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, told KDKA that his wife Holly called him while she was at the Northland Library complaining that the car smelled like it was burning and making strange sounds.\n\n\u2018I told her to pop the hood, and this is the picture she sent me,\u2019 Persic said. He told ABC \u2018She sent that text and my jaw hit the floor.\u2019\n\nThe shocking photo shows the SUV\u2019s engine compartment so full of debris that the actual components of the car are not even visible.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nPersic said he met his wife at the library and began picking walnuts out of the car \u2013 unfortunately, in the pouring rain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said: \u2018It took about at least 45 minutes. There was a lot. I was soaking wet\u2026 but i could still see a good amount of walnuts underneath the motor.\u2019\n\nGirl, 8, had tear ducts torn out during 2nd mauling from dog her mother refused to give up\n\nAfter removing as much as much of the grass and walnuts as they could, the couple drove the car to a nearby mechanic.\n\n\u2018They put it up on the life and, I guess there\u2019s a protective plate underneath, so when they took that off all the walnuts fell out all over the place,\u2019 Persic said.\n\nBy the time the mechanic was done, half of a trash can was filled with walnuts.\n\nBoys 'threw huge log off cliff for fun' only for it to strike and kill photographer\n\nLuckily for the Persics, the car did not have any serious damage.\n\nChris Persic later posted to Facebook, writing: \u2018Whether people are gonna admit it or not, I guarantee at least a couple of people have looked under their hood since seeing the post.\u2019", "description": "Chris Persic, who owns the car, said the squirrels appeared to have stored enough to last them the next three winters.", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/persic-c7cd_1570818750.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
