Kevin Rudd: Economic Conservative.''\n\nIn Canberra on Wednesday for a meeting of Labor's economic team to discuss the policy agenda, Dr Chalmers said the re-engagement with business, which Mr Albanese also advocated in a speech last month, was not a token exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnthony has set the example and a firm direction for the whole team to consult widely and frequently with business,'' he said.\n\n\u201cI want to make sure our engagement with business over the next few years is meaningful and structured, not just some kind of a tick-a-box exercise.\"\n\nDr Chalmers has started distributing to business a consultation paper that lambasts the government over the state of the economy and calls for an economic growth strategy \"to create good, well-paid jobs, make inroads into unemployment and underemployment, and lift the overall living standards of all Australians''.\n\nIt does not mention revenue-raising through increased taxes and instead urges a focus on four key areas.\n\nThese take immediate action to stimulate the economy rather than continuing to rely on increasingly ineffective interest rate cuts; tackling major drags on productivity with policies to boost business investment and skills development; managing the external forces bearing down on the economy ranging from climate change and technology to the ageing population; and approaching the reform task \"with a mindset of partnership and co-operation''.\n\nEven after the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates for the third time this year, delivering a record low cash rate of 0.75 per cent, the Morrison government is holding the line by maintaining that its current policy settings for now are adequate to turn around the economy.\n\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg has confirmed the May budget will contain an investment allowance for business but nothing else concrete in terms of additional stimulus has been mooted in the meantime.\n\nLabor's discussion paper says \"the RBA is doing too much of the heavy lifting'' and the low cash rate \"has left Australia dangerously exposed in the event of an external shock or global slowdown, at a time of escalating global economic risks\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt questions the effectiveness of further rate cuts and again calls on the government to do more via fiscal policy.\n\nThis includes fast-tracking infrastructure spending where possible, bringing forward stage two of the income tax cuts which are not scheduled to begin until July 1, 2022, \"responsibly'' increasing the rate of Newstart, implementing the investment guarantee for business, and developing a plan to boost wages, starting with a reversal of the cuts to penalty rates made in the last term of government.\n\nThe document says working with business is also important to restore trust in institutions which, in turn, is vital to effect difficult policy reform.\n\n\"Trust in institutions has declined around the world, and there is evidence that Australians' trust in government has declined in recent years,'' it says.\n\n\"To facilitate the necessary policy change and reform to turn our economy around, government needs to do a better job of partnering and communicating with industry and communities to support new investment, innovation and decent well-paid jobs.\n\n\"This is especially important for communities experiencing the sharper edge of economic transition and high levels of unemployment, and in communities that will not directly benefit from some of the big forces set to shape Australia in coming years.\"", "description": "Labor is working overtime to mend relations with business, while also shifting its policy emphasis away from tax and spend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1936%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cf4e546a6cd2800bfc91ca3125d1e1afb713fcf7", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
