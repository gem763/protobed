John Allen criticized President Donald Trump's decision to stand down as the Turkish military launched an assault on northeastern Syria.\n\n\"This is just chaos,\" Allen said during an interview with CNN on Wednesday.\n\nAllen, who commanded the US-led coalition force in Afghanistan and is now president of the Brookings Institute think tank, criticized Trump for pulling back a small contingent of US troops from the Syria-Turkey border ahead of the Turkish military operation.\n\nTrump spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by phone on Sunday, during which Erdogan asked Trump to allow Turkey to establish a \"safe zone\" for Syrian refugees inside Syria, according to the Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin.\n\nOn Sunday night, the White House announced US troops near the border would be shifted elsewhere as Turkey moved \"forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump.

THE USA IS GREAT!\"\n\nAllen characterized Trump's decision as an abrupt shift that would likely have disastrous consequences for the region.\n\n\"We don't do strategy, and we shouldn't be doing foreign policy, by tweet,\" Allen told CNN. \"And this is what you get when you have a single phone call between world leaders.\"\n\nRead more: The general who led the fight against ISIS says Trump's new policy 'breaks that trust' after years of hard fighting\n\nAllen said Kurdish forces, on whom the US relied heavily in the fight against ISIS, would face significant losses against the Turkish military. About 11,000 members of the Kurdish-majority Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) died fighting ISIS, according to some estimates, and thousands of ISIS fighters are held in prisons and camps guarded by Kurdish forces.\n\nTurkey claims the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, and the SDF are threats with links to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Turkey-based group that Ankara, Turkey's capital, and the US, among others, have designated as a terrorist organization.\n\n\"Once you push into an area like this, once you start using indirect fire, once you start drawing a lot of blood from an organization that has just been fighting now for a couple of years against the most abhorrent terrorist organization on the planet, the Islamic State, these people were bucking down to begin the process of the stabilization of that entire region,\" Allen said.\n\nUS Marines firing a howitzer in Syria. US Marine Corps\n\nIn addition to assistance fighting ISIS, the presence of about 1,000 US troops at the border has been viewed as a deterrent to Turkish incursions in the region.\n\n\"That's why those thousand American troops, if we were going to draw a circle around a group of American troops who are more important right now to the stabilization of any place on the planet, it's that thousand troops,\" Allen added.\n\nOther former senior US military leaders have criticized the development. Former US Central Command Commander and retired Army Gen. Joseph Votel expressed disappointment in a column, calling it an \"abrupt policy\" that appeared to \"abandon our Kurdish partners.\"\n\nLawmakers from both parties have also denounced the move.\n\nRead more: 'The President eats his own': Military veterans in Congress unload on Trump for abandoning a US ally in the ISIS fight\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump's staunchest allies, urged the president \"to change course while there is still time.\"\n\n\"Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration,\" Graham said on Twitter. \"This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS.\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Marine combat veteran, described Trump as \"a failure of a Commander in Chief who has no idea what it means to serve.\"\n\n\"This decision sends the message to our adversaries that America doesn't keep our promises and there will be no consequences for their dangerous behavior,\" Moulton tweeted. \"This is a grave mistake that will cost lives.\"\n\nTurkish aircraft began bombing northern Syria on Wednesday morning, according to unverified accounts from SDF forces.\n\nTrump and White House officials say they are not endorsing or taking part in the military campaign and threatened economic sanctions against Turkey.\n\n\"As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!).\" Trump tweeted on Monday.", "description": "\"We don't do strategy, and we shouldn't be doing foreign policy, by tweet,\" retired US Marine Corps Gen.
