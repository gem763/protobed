You stopped going to Jane's house after Denisha moved back two months prior. She did not approve of you,\" added Naidu.\n\nShe alleged Pillay was incredibly violent when he killed Denisha.\n\n\"You caught her, grabbed the knife and repeatedly stabbed her in the throat because she was in your way. You folded her like a doll and put her into the cupboard. As you were there at the scene busy with Denisha, Rackelle came home and that is why you killed Rackelle. Jane was your final victim, she was your main target.\"\n\n'I don't know' - response to DNA evidence\n\nPillay was again left speechless when Naidu presented him with DNA evidence that was found on a TV at the crime scene.\n\n\"How did your DNA end up on the television set that was removed from the wall? I will put to the court that you tried to make the murders look like a robbery. You had not been in the home for two months. How else could the DNA have gotten there?\"\n\nA visibly shocked Pillay, who was vocal throughout most of the day, could only respond: \"I don't know.\"\n\nThe case continues on Wednesday.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
