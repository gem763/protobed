There were two people killed inside,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Historic op\u2019-\n\nUS media cited multiple government sources as saying Baghdadi may have killed himself with a suicide vest as US special operations forces descended.\n\nHe was the target of the secretly planned operation that was approved by Trump, officials said according to US media.\n\nThe commander-in-chief of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces who have been fighting IS in Syria said the operation came after \u201cjoint intelligence work\u201d with American forces.\n\n\u201cA historic operation is successful as a consequence of joint intelligence work with the United States of America,\u201d he said on Twitter shortly after the news broke.\n\nFrom the outskirts of Barisha, an inhabitant of a camp for the displaced also heard helicopters followed by what he described as coalition air strikes.\n\nThey \u201cwere flying very low, causing great panic among the people,\u201d Ahmed Hassawi told AFP by phone.\n\nThe AFP correspondent said the area of the night-time strikes had been cordoned off by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Syria\u2019s former Al-Qaeda affiliate controlling Idlib.\n\nLong pursued by the US-led coalition against IS, Baghdadi has been erroneously reported dead several times in recent years.\n\nOfficials told ABC News that biometric work was under way to firm up the identification of those killed in the raid.\n\nTrump earlier tweeted, without explaining, \u201cSomething very big has just happened!\u201d\n\nIn 2014, IS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and Baghdadi appeared in a video that summer announcing a \u201ccaliphate\u201d in regions they controlled.\n\nAt the height of IS rule, Baghdadi held sway over millions people in the cross-border proto-state, where IS implemented its brutal version of Islamic law.\n\nIt was blamed for the deaths of thousands of civilians and accused of war crimes.\n\nBut several offensives in both countries whittled down that territory, and in March the US-backed SDF ousted the extremist group from its last patch of territory in eastern Syria.\n\n\u2013 $25 million reward \u2013\n\nBaghdadi \u2014 an Iraqi native believed to be around 48 years old \u2014 was rarely seen.\n\nAfter 2014 he disappeared from sight, only surfacing in a video in April this year with a wiry grey and red beard and an assault rifle at his side, as he encouraged followers to \u201ctake revenge\u201d for IS members who had been killed.\n\nHis reappearance was seen as a reassertion of his leadership of a group that, while it had lost its physical territory, had spread from the Middle East to Asia and Africa and claimed several deadly attacks in Europe.\n\nBut Baghdadi remained on the run. The US State Department posted a $25 million reward for information on his whereabouts.\n\nUnder Baghdadi, the State Department said, IS \u201chas been responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the Middle East, including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u201d.\n\nIn September, the group released an audio message said to be from Baghdadi praising the operations of IS affiliates in other regions.\n\nIt also called on scattered IS fighters to regroup and try to free thousands of their comrades held in jails and camps by the SDF in northeastern Syria.\n\nIdlib is controlled by former Al-Qaeda affiliate HTS, and includes the presence of Al-Qaeda-linked fighters from the Hurras al-Deen group as well as IS cells, according to the Observatory.\n\n\u201cIf Baghdadi was indeed in Barisha, it will be interesting to understand how he managed to even get there (through Syria or through Turkey?),\u201d tweeted Michael Horowitz, a Middle East security analyst with the Le Beck consultancy.", "description": "Near Barisha (Syria) (AFP) \u2013 Jihadist supremo Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the world\u2019s most wanted man, was believed Sunday to have been killed in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/e5c058_islamic-state-group-chief-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-appears-time-in-years-in-propaganda-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
