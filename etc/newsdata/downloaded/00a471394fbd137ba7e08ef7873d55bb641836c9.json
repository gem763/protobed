Last year the Public Accounts Committee warned that academies are using taxpayers\u2019 money to pay \u201cunjustifiably\u201d high salaries to senior staff, warning that high wages could \u2018become the norm\u2019 and pile more pressure onto school budgets.\n\nIn some cases, academy trusts are failing to prove that hefty pay packages are appropriate, MPs said. \"Some academy trusts appear to be using public money to pay excessive salaries,\u201d their report noted.\n\nThe MPs went on to warn that \u201cexcessive trustee salaries deprive the frontline of vital funds\u201d, adding that the DfE has \u201cno easy way\u201d of linking performance with pay, and so cannot know whether those earning large pay packages are those responsible for the best-performing schools.\n\nIn July, the DfE revealed the identities of the 146 academy trusts that paid at least one person \u00a3150,000 or more in 2017-18. This represents a rise from the 125 trusts that were named as paying the same amount the year before.\n\nMeanwhile, a total of 988 academies had at least one person on \u00a3100,000 or more in 2017-18.", "description": "Schools that pay staff over \u00a3100,000 are to be penalised when applying for Government funding, ministers have said.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Benedict Spence", "Michael Gove", "Nick Timothy"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2017/01/11/117582340money-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWSm3Hskyb1S8n9mpYgoiGz7qDM1k-FXUpc9UWB6g6Ho.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
