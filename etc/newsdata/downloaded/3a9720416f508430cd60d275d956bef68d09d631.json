Specifically, it's my BLUNT Metro Umbrella that has stood the test of many strong storms as I traipsed on sidewalks littered with the abandoned corpses of broken umbrellas.\n\nAs I'm sure you've done as well, I've bought my fair share of under-$20 drugstore umbrellas during weather emergencies when I had no other choice. They tend to last a couple storms at best before flipping inside out and breaking. Buy enough cheap umbrellas that quickly fail you and you really start to question the sustainability of this purchasing tactic.\n\nWith their pointy spikes, traditional umbrellas also aren't the safest contraptions, and it was this safety concern that first prompted design engineer and BLUNT creator Greig Brebner to think about redesigning the umbrella. Most umbrellas do an extraordinarily bad job at staying over our heads and out of other people's eyes, and it's because they're not easy to design.\n\nHowever, after many iterations, Brebner figured out a way to make a better umbrella. In an interview with Design Travel, Brebner says that, \"Solving the safety element and removing the spike also ended up being the solution to tensioning the canopy, which creates a stronger umbrella.\"\n\nBLUNT's patented Radial Tensioning System redirects and distributes the effort used in opening the umbrella throughout the entire canopy surface, allowing it to hold up to heavy downpours and gale-force winds of up to 55 miles an hour. Thus, while clocking in at a light and compact 0.8 pounds and 14 inches long (when closed), the BLUNT Metro Umbrella is surprisingly sturdy.\n\nEvery BLUNT umbrella goes through a 38-point testing process to ensure it's ready to protect you when you need it the most. As the following video proves, wind, rain, and hail are no longer weather conditions to make you nervous when you have a BLUNT umbrella in hand:\n\nThis friendly-looking polyester umbrella has turned out to be one of my best weapons during a rainstorm, and a couple months into a season filled with rain, it's rarely left my side. It pops open with a push of a button and is easy to throw in my bag. Plus, with its bright color options and rounded edges, it certainly stands out in a crowd of all-black umbrellas.\n\nThe Metro Umbrella is the smallest of all of BLUNT's offerings, but I found it was perfectly suitable for one person. If you don't plan on sharing with others, I'd recommend the Metro. It costs $60, which is reasonable when I think about the scores of cheap umbrellas that I've wasted money on that definitely add up to more than $60. With BLUNT, you won't be throwing your umbrella away within a few uses.\n\nI know my BLUNT Metro Umbrella will come in handy for all the April showers to come. Whether you're experiencing the same pre-bloom rain or just want to be prepared for future weather conditions, it's a good idea to invest in BLUNT.\n\nBuy the BLUNT Metro Umbrella for $60 at Amazon and Nordstrom in tons of colors.", "description": "It's my BLUNT Metro Umbrella that has stood the test of many strong storms as I traipsed on sidewalks littered with the abandoned corpses of broken umbrellas.", "authors": ["Connie Chen", "Insider Picks"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5ac29c7760b8d73f218b4788?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2018-04-27"}
