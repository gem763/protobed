The idea is not just to transplant but also to ensure that the trees survive. The project developer has been directed to ensure that the transplanted trees get best care,\u201d an NHAI official at the site told TOI.\n\nAjay Nagar, who had carried out successful transplantation for Lucknow Metro and for a road project in Sitarganj (Uttarakhand) in the past three years, has been engaged for this task.\n\nHe said transplanted trees need utmost care till the time they are fully back to life.\n\nRepresentational Image\n\nIf the process is followed correctly, there\u2019s a 80-85 per cent chance of survival, he added.\n\nThe trees were being transplanted in sector parks and roads of Dwarka.\n\nThe entire project of transplantation will cost the NHAI close to Rs 70 crore. For transplanting one tree, the government agency is spending around Rs 30,000.\n\nPublic interest in protecting trees has grown manifold as awareness around climate change and global warming spreads. The overnight felling of trees in Mumbai\u2019s Aarey Colony to build a metro shed sparked massive public outrage, following which the Supreme Court had to intervene and order stay on cutting of trees.", "description": "In what could pave way for better management of trees for development purposes, 5,700 fully grown trees will be transplanted elsewhere to build the Dwarka Expressway, providing another link to Gurgaon.
