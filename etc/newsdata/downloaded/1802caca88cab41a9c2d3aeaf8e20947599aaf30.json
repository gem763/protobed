Indeed, while two comprehensive surveys of European Jews on anti-Semitism have been conducted in the past decade alone, our research shows no such studies of American Jews have been done for at least half a century. Today, however, after the deadly attack in Pittsburgh and another at a synagogue in Poway, California, and as anti-Jewish hate surges among both the far right and the hard left, this survey could hardly be more necessary or timely.\n\nExperiencing anti-Semitism personally\n\nIts alarming findings should serve as a wake-up call \u2014 and a call to action.\n\nAmerican Jews are deeply concerned about anti-Semitism and believe it is getting worse. Nearly nine out of every 10 American Jews (88%) believe anti-Semitism is a problem in America, and over eight in 10 (84%) say it has increased over the past five years. That includes a plurality \u2014 43% \u2014 who say it has increased a lot.\n\nConcern about anti-Semitism cuts across differences of age, politics and Jewish denomination. More than nine in 10 (93%) Democrats, 87% of independents and three-quarters of Republicans say anti-Semitism is a problem in America.\n\nA startling number of American Jews have experienced anti-Semitism in the past five years. More than a third say they have personally been the targets of anti-Semitism, including nearly a quarter who say they\u2019ve been recipients of anti-Semitic remarks in person, by mail or by phone; a fifth who say they\u2019ve been targeted by anti-Semitic remarks online; and 2% who say they\u2019ve been physically attacked for being Jewish.\n\nYoung people are significantly more likely to have been victims of anti-Semitism, with 45% of respondents ages 18-29 saying they have been targeted by anti-Semitic remarks or have been physically attacked for being Jewish.\n\nWeaponizing bias: Trump and Republicans are ginning up fake anti-Semitism for political gain. Don't buy it.\n\nDisturbingly, nearly a third of American Jews say they have avoided publicly wearing, carrying or displaying things that might help people identify them as Jewish, while a quarter say they avoid certain places, events or situations out of concern for their safety or comfort as Jews at least some of the time. Young people are most likely to have hidden their Jewishness in public, with nearly four in 10 of those ages 18-29 saying they have done so.\n\nBeing anti-Israel seen as anti-Semitic\n\nAmerican Jews resoundingly view efforts and statements against the state of Israel as being tainted by anti-Semitism. The statement that \"Israel has no right to exist\" (anti-Zionism) is viewed by 84% of respondents, including 78% of young people, as anti-Semitic; 80% say the same of the statement, \u201cThe U.S. government only supports Israel because of Jewish money,\u201d and 73% say so about the statement, \u201cAmerican Jews are more loyal to Israel than to America.\u201d\n\nOf respondents who say they were familiar with the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement (BDS) targeting Israel, only 14% say it isn\u2019t anti-Semitic: Over a third characterize the movement as mostly anti-Semitic, while just under half say it isn\u2019t mostly anti-Semitic but has anti-Semitic supporters.\n\nHow to fight anti-Semitism: Show up for Shabbat, stand with Jewish neighbors.\n\nAsked about the sources of anti-Semitism, nine in 10 American Jews say the far right represents a threat to Jews in the United States, 85% say the same of extremists claiming to act in the name of Islam, and nearly two-thirds say so about the far left. While Democrats and Republicans are each more likely to see threats to Jews on the other side of the political map, majorities of American Jews affiliated with both parties view the far right, the hard left and extremism in the name of Islam as anti-Semitic threats.", "description": "American Jews think anti-Semitism is growing worse.
