The PKK has been branded a \"terrorist\" organisation by Turkey and several other countries.\n\nWednesday's cross-border operation was not the first. Last year, Turkey launched a similar offensive dubbed Operation Olive Branch into Syria's Afrin town to \"clear the area of terrorists\".\n\nThe SDF, while not wanting to comment on specifics, told Al Jazeera it was reviewing Turkish military strategy during Olive Branch to map out a response to the current operation.\n\nAccording to local activists on the ground, the number one target for Turkey is the Arab-majority town of Tal Abyad, where Ankara hopes to quickly establish a ground presence.\n\nTurkish security analyst and former special forces soldier Necdet Ozcelik told Al Jazeera he expects the first phase of Turkey's operation will only last about 10 days, or a couple of weeks maximum, with the goal to take control of the area between Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain.\n\nThe offensive will also involve thousands of Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels providing ground support for Turkish commandos and its regular soldiers.\n\n'Under pressure'\n\nCiviroglu said two scenarios were likely to unfold: Turkey intensifying ground operations, or the operation being halted because of condemnation from the international community.\n\n\"Trump is under pressure, the Turkish government is under pressure, the UN Security Council will meet today ... The world is not buying arguments of the Turkish government,\" he said.\n\n\"The SDF always wanted good relations [with Turkey] ... Kurdish sympathy is very strong, that's why there's strong diplomatic efforts to put an end to this.\"\n\nThe possibility remains that Syrian government forces of President Bashar al-Assad may try to capture the main city of Manbij, if the United States decides to withdraw its troops from there without giving early warning to the Turks.\n\n\"In this case, the Syrian army may try to capture Manbij before the Turkish forces or the FSA,\" Ozcelik said.\n\n\"We might be seeing some sort of tension, or maybe limited confrontation, between the FSA elements and the Assad regime forces in Manbij area, but not in the eastern part.\"\n\n'Turkish aggression'\n\nThe SDF responded to Turkey's military action with artillery attacks and rockets fired into Turkish territory.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter the Kurdish fighters would not allow Turkish troops to advance further. \"We will use all our possibilities against Turkish aggression,\" he said.\n\nHeavy fighting was taking place in Syrian border villages between advancing Turkish forces and SDF soldiers on Thursday.\n\nOzcelik said the Kurds were no match for the advancing Turkish-led forces.\n\n\"The YPG elements are composed of a lot of PKK ideology people, and they forcibly recruited many people who did not have serious military experience,\" he said. \"I'm expecting a lot of defections from the YPG side, so the Turkish military is going to take advantage of that.\"\n\nRobert Wesley of the Terrorism Research Initiative told Al Jazeera that Turkey will also suffer setbacks considering how vast the area is that it wants to control.\n\n\"It will require huge amounts of direct military engagement from the Turkish side,\" Wesley said.\n\n\"The use of the FSA, that will also be limited [because] these groups are not really well-trained. They don't have a strong track record with more sophisticated defences.\"\n\nTurkey may not have the appetite for sustaining significant casualties, Wesley said, which a serious military encounter with the SDF would necessitate.\n\n\"I don't think either side is particularly well prepared for the engagement,\" he said.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the SDF is not having a weapon system that can counter Turkish air attacks, Civiroglu said.\n\n\"[Even so] they have said they will defend themselves until the end,\" he noted.\n\nRussian reaction\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin phoned Ankara after the Turkish operation began to stress that Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected.\n\nThe Kremlin said it would not interfere further in Syria after years of supporting Assad's forces against rebel groups, but cautioned Turkey not to take any steps that would destabilise the region.\n\nCagaptay said Moscow has no choice but to back Turkey's move. \"The most Russia will do is to voice support behind closed doors, even though they may publicly criticise the operation,\" he said.\n\nHe said the Kremlin may even be welcoming Ankara's military action.\n\n\"The [Syrian] regime and Russia consider Turkey a threat, so by provoking Turkey to attack Kurds really Russia is hitting two birds with one,\" Cagaptay said. \"Hitting Kurds, trying to make Kurds dependent on Russia, at the same time allow Turkey to suppress the Kurds, not allow them to make gains.\"\n\nEven if Turkey is successful in securing its so-called \"safe-zone\" to return about two million Syrian refugees, there will be major challenges ahead, observers said.\n\nThe complex issue of containing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) fighters who are still active in the region must be addressed by Turkey.\n\nAs seen by the suicide attack claimed by the armed group in Raqqa on an SDF intelligence base, killing 13 people, ISIL may be defeated militarily but sleeper cells are still prevalent.\n\n\"It's unfamiliar territory for Turkey,\" Civiroglu said. \"It's Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Christians, and Yazidis of the region [who] fought these people.\"", "description": "Tactic is to advance into Arab-majority areas and drive a wedge between YPG-controlled territory, observers say.", "authors": ["Tessa Fox"], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/10/4ea2542549d14dbeb82d372ea155a3b1_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
