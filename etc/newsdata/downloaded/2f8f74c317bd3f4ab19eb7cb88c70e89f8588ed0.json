The president lost Minnesota to Hillary Clinton by just 1.5 percentage points in 2016, and he has frequently talked of his desire to win it in 2020. The city is preparing to greet the president by holding a massive protest in which thousands are expected to attend and will center on the fighting policies of hate and Trump's anti-immigration rhetoric. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen will also be in attendance for the rally, but it's unclear if the big names can help fill Target Center's nearly 20,000 seats.\n\nCLOSE Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi has announced a formal impeachment inquiry. It only took an op-ed from seven House Dems in difficult districts. USA TODAY\n\nCuba Gooding Jr groping trial set to start in New York \u2060\u2014 again\n\nOscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding Jr. is set to go on trial Thursday on a misdemeanor groping charge stemming from a New York City bar encounter in June.But that's what the Manhattan District Attorney's Office said in September when jury selection was supposed to begin \u2014 and instead the case was postponed because prosecutors said they were still waiting for evidence in the case. Gooding is the second celebrity criminal case scheduled to be tried in New York in the post-#MeToo era. It's also a rare example of prosecuting a groping case, a crime seldom reported in New York, says local criminal defense attorney Stuart Slotnick. Gooding, 51, has pleaded not guilty, insisting that \"nothing happened.\"\n\nHere's the Cuba Gooding Jr video: Does it show him groping accuser?\n\nCalifornia power outages stretch into second day\n\nNearly 2 million Californians will be without power for a second day Thursday as part of safety measures aimed at curbing wildfire risks amid high winds and hot, dry conditions. Pacific Gas and Electric on Wednesday shut off power to more than 700,000 Northern California homes and businesses, and the utility said the shutdown was expected to last through most of Thursday and perhaps longer, depending on wind conditions. Schools remain shuttered for thousands of students. PG&E has been under intense scrutiny since November, when the company's transmission lines ignited a wildfire that killed 85 people and destroyed more than 10,000 homes.\n\nSimone Biles to compete for all-around title\n\nSimone Biles is all but assured of winning the all-around title at the World Gymnastics Championships Thursday. She hasn\u2019t lost an all-around competition since nationals in 2013, and it\u2019s been five years since anyone\u2019s even gotten close to her. A win would mark Biles fifth all-around title, and would be Biles\u2019 22nd medal at the world championships, one less than the record set by Belarus' Vitaly Scherbo. On Tuesday, Biles led the American team to its fifth consecutive title \u2060\u2014 earning the 22-year-old her 21st medal, the most for a female gymnast.\n\nSnow in October? Winter storm could drop up to 2 feet of snow\n\nA potentially historic winter storm will slam the north-central United States over the next few days with up to 2 feet of snow possible in some areas. The system will produce severe storms and heavy rain Thursday in the southern Plains and critical-to-extreme fire weather threats from the central and southern Rockies to California. The storm will have two parts, the first of which is targeting the northern and central Rockies and High Plains on Wednesday into Thursday. The second part will bring snow to the eastern and central portions of the Dakotas and western Minnesota by week's end.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/10/trump-campaign-rally-simone-biles-california-power-outages-winter-storm/3899113002/", "description": "Trump to hold campaign rally in\u00a0Minneapolis, Simone Biles eyes for more gold at the World Gymnastics Championships and more things to start your Thursday morning.", "authors": ["Editors", "Usa Today", "Published A.M.
