John Hickenlooper (D) predicts in a new interview.\n\n\u201cHe does not think in any way that it\u2019s a good thing for this country to have legal marijuana, so when he rattles his saber, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he closes down one or two of these facilities just to make that statement,\u201d Hickenlooper told The Hill\u2019s Power Politics podcast.\n\nIn 2012, Colorado voters amended the state\u2019s Constitution to legalize recreational marijuana, which went on sale there in 2014. Hickenlooper opposed the measure initially, but has defended the decision as the will of his state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThirty states and Washington, D.C., have laws legalizing marijuana in some form. The Colorado governor said the trend is nearing \u201ccritical mass\u201d and should nudge Congress and the Trump administration to take specific, supportive action.\n\n\"Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, Congress will step in and say, 'OK, we\u2019re going to allow states to pursue these experiments, and we\u2019re going to let them have banking so it\u2019s not all done in cash, and you\u2019re putting people\u2019s lives at risk, and we\u2019re going to have better tests \u2026 someone\u2019s going to figure out a breathalyzer for marijuana,' \" he said.\n\nSubscribe now: Apple Podcasts | Soundcloud | Stitcher | Google Play | TuneIn\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Steven Terner MnuchinThe Hill's Morning Report \u2014 Trump takes aim at whistleblower Hillicon Valley: Treasury sanctions Russians over 2018 election meddling | How Facebook fought back on FTC fine | WeWork calls off IPO | Elon Musk unveils Mars rocket US sanctions Russian individuals for interference in 2018 elections MORE has told governors the administration is weighing an approach to banks that remain leery of serving marijuana businesses and their cash transactions. Governors believe the allure of cash encourages crime and threatens public safety.\n\nAfter talking with the attorney general, Hickenlooper said he believes the Justice Department wants to \u201csow doubt\u201d through tough federal action as a way to deter the marijuana trend nationwide.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no predictability now in the marijuana business,\u201d Hickenlooper said during a discussion on the sidelines of the annual National Governors Association conference in Washington this week.\n\nThe term-limited governor, who is in his final year in office, said officials in other states consult him about the pros and cons of legalizing cannabis.\n\n\u201cI tell people to wait another year or two,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Colorado governor said that, to date, research in his state has not shown an increase in marijuana use by teenagers nor a surge in people driving while high, something that critics of the measure warned could happen when voters weighed legalization in 2012.\n\nOne consequence, he said, is that many former black market vendors have emerged from the shadows.\n\n\u201cNow, look at all these people who are involved in the marijuana business and are paying taxes. They\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Hickenlooper said.\n\nDuring a separate interview this week, Alaska Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, said he also defends marijuana legalization as a states-rights issue.\n\nIn 2015, Alaska became the third state to legalize marijuana for adults 21 and older.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s created a bit of commerce,\u201d the governor said, noting that no communities have voted to opt out. \u201cIt has generated employment.\u201d\n\nSubscribe now: Apple Podcasts | Soundcloud | Stitcher | Google Play | TuneIn", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s no predictability now in the marijuana business,\u201d John Hickenlooper says.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/powerpolitics_hickenlooper_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2018-02-24"}
