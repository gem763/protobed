Bernie Sanders is the latest Democratic presidential candidate to release a comprehensive housing reform plan. Multiple candidates, including Senators Cory Booker, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, have released detailed plans showcasing how they would tackle the trouble many Americans face when looking to find a home to rent or to buy.\n\n\u2018For the first time in recent memory, affordable housing is a topic on the presidential campaign trail.\u2019 Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition\n\n\u201cFor the first time in recent memory, affordable housing is a topic on the presidential campaign trail,\u201d said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\nSome 85% of Americans \u201cbelieve ensuring everyone has a safe, decent, affordable place to live should be a top national priority,\u201d according to a nationwide public-opinion poll commissioned between the National Low Income Housing Coalition and Hart Research Associates.\n\nA majority of people from both the Democratic and Republican parties said they held this view, the poll said. \u201cGiven this strong public sentiment, it\u2019s no wonder that policy makers are increasingly heeding the call,\u201d Yentel said.\n\nBut the primary calendar itself may be largely the cause of candidates\u2019 enthusiasm, said Rick Sharga, a mortgage-industry veteran.\n\n\u201cCalifornia \u2014 perhaps the epicenter of unaffordable housing \u2014 is scheduled to have its primary earlier than in past election cycles, and voters in the Golden State will very likely pay more attention to the affordable housing proposals being presented by the Democratic hopefuls than voters in many other states,\u201d Sharga said.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken steps recently to address housing-related issues. Last week, the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development unveiled plans outlining how America\u2019s housing-finance system could be overhauled, including ending the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And on Tuesday, the White House released an extensive report detailing the forces contributing to chronic homelessness, particularly in states like California.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: 5 major changes the Trump administration wants to make to housing finance\n\nThe following Democratic candidates did not respond to requests for comment from MarketWatch, nor have they released plans nor spoken extensively about issues surrounding housing: Former Vice President Joe Biden, hedge-fund billionaire Tom Steyer, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, former Rep. Joe Sestak from Pennsylvania.\n\nHere\u2019s what other Democratic candidates are saying about affordable housing:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders\n\nBernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, released a plan dubbed \u201cHousing for All,\u201d that addresses everything from the need to build more housing units to combatting gentrification.\n\nLike many of his policies, the Sanders campaign framed its housing proposal in the context of what the average American faces versus Wall Street\u2019s profits. \u201cIn America today, over 18 million families are paying more than 50 percent of their income on housing, while last year alone the five largest banks on Wall Street made a record-breaking $111 billion in profits,\u201d the campaign said in its description of Sanders\u2019 plan.\n\nHere are some of the many ways in which Sanders hopes to address Americans\u2019 housing needs:\n\n\u2022 Preventing Wall Street funds from selling large pools of mortgages\n\n\u2022 Investing $1.48 trillion over a decade in the National Affordable Housing Trust to fund the building, rehabilitation and/or preservation of 7.4 million affordable housing units.\n\n\u2022 Setting aside $70 billion to repair and modernize public housing.\n\n\u2022 Creating a national cap on annual rent increases at no more than 3% or 1.5 times the Consumer Price Index (whichever is higher).\n\n\u2022 Forming an office in the Department of Housing and Urban Development designed to strengthen rent control, tenant protections and inclusive zoning.\n\n\u2022 Making federal funding contingent on states encouraging development that promotes integration and public transportation access.\n\n\u2022 Instating a 25% home flipping tax on real-estate speculators who sell non-owner-occupied properties that sell for more than their original purchase price if sold within five years.\n\n\u2022 Creating an independent National Fair Housing Agency in the vein of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that protects people from housing discrimination and enforces housing standards for renters.\n\n\u2022 Investing $8 billion across HUD and the Department of Agriculture to form a first-time homebuyer assistance program\n\nAffordable housing also features as part of Sanders\u2019 proposal for an \u201cEconomic Bill of Rights.\u201d During a campaign speech earlier this year, Sanders claimed that some Americans are \u201cpaying 40%, 50%, 60% of their limited income in housing\u201d and called the situation \u201cabsurd.\u201d Sanders has further referenced urban gentrification as an issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nIn the first Democratic presidential debate, Sanders also mentioned the country\u2019s homeless population in response to a question about his calls for expanded government benefits.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren\n\nAs she has done on other issues, such as student debt, Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has released a detailed plan to tackle a wide variety of housing-related issues.\n\n\u201cHousing is not just the biggest expense for most American families \u2014 or the biggest purchase most Americans will make in their lifetimes,\u201d the Warren campaign said in a post to the site Medium. \u201cIt also affects the jobs you can get, the schools your children can go to, and the kinds of communities you can live in. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that government gets housing policy right.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Warren has introduced the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, which serves as the backbone of her affordable housing plan:\n\nElizabeth Warren has a plan to build, preserve or rehabilitate 3.2 million housing units for lower- and middle-income people to lower rents by 10%.\n\nWarren\u2019s plan includes, among other things:\n\n\u2022 Building, preserving or rehabilitating 3.2 million housing units nationwide for lower- and middle-income people in order to lower rents by 10%. This, she said, would be funded by raising the estate tax back to Bush-era levels.\n\n\u2022 Creating a down-payment assistance program designed to address the black-white homeownership gap by providing assistance to first-time home buyers who live in a formerly red-lined neighborhoods or communities that were segregated by law and are still currently low-income.\n\n\u2022 Expanding fair-housing legislation to bar housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, veteran status or income.\n\n\u2022 Extending the Community Reinvestment Act to require non-bank mortgage lenders invest in minority communities.\n\n\u2022 Providing $2 billion in assistance to mortgage borrowers who are still underwater on their home loans following the financial crisis, meaning they owe more than their homes are worth.\n\n\u2022 Instituting new requirements for sales of delinquent mortgages .\n\nFormer Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Juli\u00e1n Castro\n\nNaturally, as the former HUD Secretary under President Obama, Castro has also put forth an extensive plan for addressing housing-related issues more broadly. Among the many ideas he suggested, Castro proposed:\n\n\u2022 Ending chronic homelessness nationwide by 2028 by expanding funding for grant programs and creating a definition of homelessness at the federal level.\n\n\u2022 Expanding the housing choice voucher program.\n\n\u2022 Creating a refundable renters\u2019 tax credit for households who spend more than 30% of their income on housing.\n\nJulian Castro proposes allocating an additional $45 billion annually for the national Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund to support affordable housing initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Allocating an additional $45 billion annually for the national Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund to support affordable housing initiatives.\n\n\u2022 Reforming zoning laws to encourage the construction of affordable housing.\n\n\u2022 Extending fair-housing protections to the LGBTQ community and to individuals who were previously incarcerated.\n\n\u2022 Developing an approach to identify where gentrification is occurring and help households avoid being displaced.\n\n\u2022 Establishing zoning policies that take into account climate change.\n\nSen. Cory Booker\n\nIn a post describing his broad plan to expand access to affordable housing, Cory Booker\u2019s campaign called housing \u201ca basic need and a basic right.\u201d Here\u2019s what the junior senator from New Jersey\u2019s plan includes:\n\n\u2022 Creating a tax credit that would aid in capping rental costs at 30% of before-tax income.\n\n\u2022 Implementing zoning reform by requiring cities to eliminate restrictive zoning rules to qualify for federal loan and grant programs.\n\n\u2022 Funding the construction of new housing units designated for low-income renters by providing $40 billion a year to the Housing Trust Fund.\n\nCory Booker wants to give $1,000 baby bonds to every child at birth, which can grow by up to $2,000 per year depending on the family\u2019s income.\n\n\u2022 Expanding fair-housing laws to prohibit housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or source of income.\n\n\u2022 Expanding access to federal housing assistance programs.\n\n\u2022 Creating a fund that would pay for legal counsel for renters facing eviction.\n\n\u2022 Increasing the amount of money designated for grants given to communities to administer homelessness services.\n\n\u2022 Giving $1,000 baby bonds to every child at birth, which can grow by up to $2,000 per year depending on the family\u2019s income. This money could then be used to fund the down payment on the purchase of a home.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris\n\nEarlier this month, Kamala Harris, the junior senator from California, released an extensive plan designed to increase the homeownership rate in black communities. This plan involved:\n\n\u2022 Expanding the range of information used to create credit scores to include data such as rent and utility payments\n\nKamala Harris wants to create a refundable tax credit for households who make less than $100,000 a year and spend at least 30% of their income on housing costs.\n\n\u2022 Setting aside $100 billion for federal grants that would help with down payments or closing costs for families who rent or live in historically redlined communities\n\n\u2022 Strengthening anti-discrimination laws to prevent discrimination in home sales, rentals and mortgage lending\n\nAdditionally, Harris has introduced the Rent Relief Act, which would create a refundable tax credit for households who make less than $100,000 a year (or $125,000 in pricier areas) and spend at least 30% of their income on housing costs.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not return a request for comment.\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg from South Bend, Ind. has put forth an extensive proposal, called the Douglass Plan, to address racial disparities in homeownership and wealth. The plan would create a \u201c21st Century Community Homestead Act\u201d that would be piloted in select cities across the country.\n\nThrough this program, a public trust would purchase abandoned properties and provide them to eligible residents. These people would include those who earn less than the area\u2019s median income or those who live in historically redlined or segregated areas. Residents who participate would be given full ownership over the land and a 10-year forgivable lien to renovate the home so it could be used as a primary residence.\n\nSeparately, Buttigieg has also suggested some other, broad steps his administration would take to address housing issues nationally\n\n\u2022 Funding national investment in affordable housing construction\n\n\u2022 Reforming land use rules to make it easier to build affordable housing units\n\n\u2022 Expanding federal protections for tenants against eviction and unjust harassment\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar\n\nSen. Klobuchar from Minnesota has included multiple housing-related initiatives as part of her outline of more than 100 actions she plans took take in her first 100 days in office, if she is elected. They include:\n\n\u2022 Reversing the Trump administration\u2019s proposed changes to federal housing subsidies.\n\n\u2022 Expanding a pilot program that provides mobility-housing vouchers to families with children to help them relocate to higher opportunity neighborhoods.\n\n\u2022 Suspending changes to fair housing policy ushered in by HUD Secretary Ben Carson in order to combat segregation in housing.\n\n\u2022 Overhaul housing policy more broadly as part of a national infrastructure plan.\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nAttorney and entrepreneur Andrew Yang\u2019s campaign did not return a request for comment. On its website, he calls for revisiting zoning rules by \u201ctaking the needs of renters and those who would be interested in moving into areas into account.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke\n\nThe former Texas congressman\u2019s campaign did not respond to MarketWatch\u2019s request for comment, but previously told Vice News that he wants to increase the funding devoted to the national Housing Trust Fund.\n\nFormer Rep. John Delaney\n\nDuring a CNN T, +1.06% Town Hall, former Rep. John Delaney from Maryland said there was an affordable housing crisis in the U.S. when asked about the rising cost of living across the country. \u201cWe need to put more resources behind affordable housing,\u201d he said.\n\nTo that end, Delaney has a proposed a $125 billion affordable housing plan which would do the following:\n\n\u2022 Increase funding for the Housing Trust Fund to at least $7 billion annually.\n\n\u2022 Create a $5 billion affordable-housing grant program that provides funding to states and municipalities that jettison zoning restrictions limiting the construction of affordable multifamily housing.\n\n\u2022 Establish a right to counsel in eviction procedures, accompanied by $500 million in federal funding for low-income renters\u2019 legal representation.\n\n\u2022 Upping the funding for the Homelessness Assistance Grant program and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Grant and Per Diem account.\n\nAdditionally, Delaney released a draft of legislation co-coauthored by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, in 2018 that would:\n\n\u2022 Revoke the charters held by secondary-mortgage market giants Fannie Mae FNMA, -3.97% and Freddie Mac FMCC, -3.95% over five years and, instead, establish a government guarantee on mortgage through the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae).\n\n\u2022 Require borrowers to put at least 5% down to get a mortgage.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet\n\nLast year, Colorado\u2019s Sen. Michael Bennet introduced legislation to combat evictions by creating a national database to track instances of eviction and giving money to local and state programs that would increase tenants\u2019 legal representation. The Bennet campaign did not return a request for comment, and its website does not lay out any specific housing-related policies though it does identify affordability as an issue.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nAuthor and speaker Marianne Williamson\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. She has not released a housing-specific plan, but did call for protecting homeowners from predatory lending practices and increasing access to loan modifications for distressed mortgage borrowers as part of a broader economic plan.\n\nThis story was updated on Sept. 19, 2019.", "description": "\u2018California, perhaps the epicenter of unaffordable housing, is scheduled to have its primary earlier than in past election cycles.\u2019", "authors": ["Jacob Passy"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HO165_dems_h_ZG_20190725125017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-25"}
