He asked to be tested for poison, and for the two girls to undergo polygraph tests.\n\nSparks received a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. He became the 16th inmate put to death this year in the U.S. and the seventh in Texas. Seven more are scheduled for execution this year in Texas, the country\u2019s busiest capital punishment state.\n\nHOURS-OLD BABY FOUND IN SUITCASE NEAR DUMPSTER; POLICE RELEASE PICTURES OF LUGGAGE\n\n\u201cI am sorry for the hard times. And what hurts me is that I hurt y'all ... even y'all, too,\u201d Sparks told family members who watched through death chamber windows.\n\n\u201cI love you all. \u2026 I feel it,\u201d he said. He was pronounced dead 23 minutes later.\n\nProsecutors said Sparks first stabbed his wife, then-30-year-old Chare Agnew, 18 times as she lay in her bed. He then went into the bedroom of his stepsons, Harold Sublet Jr. and Raekwon Agnew, took them separately into the kitchen, and stabbed them. Raekwon had been stabbed at least 45 times.\n\nHe then proceeded to rape his stepdaughters.\n\nCOSTCO SHOOTING: OFF-DUTY LA OFFICER WON'T FACE CHARGES\n\nSparks' lawyers fought until the end to have him exempt from the death penalty on grounds of intellectual disability. A psychologist hired by Sparks\u2019 attorneys said last month in an affidavit that he \u201cmeets full criteria for a diagnosis of\" intellectual disability. The Supreme Court in 2002 barred execution for mentally disabled people but states have their own discretion over how to determine intellectual disability.\n\nHis attorneys said that at the time of the trial, Sparks was not deemed intellectually disabled, but updates to the handbook used by medical professionals to diagnose mental disorders would have changed that.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court also denied a request by Sparks\u2019 attorneys to stop the execution; they alleged the jury had been improperly influenced because an officer had worn a necktie with a syringe on it, indicating he supports the death penalty.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office said the jury foreperson said she never saw the tie and did not believe it influenced jurors.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A Texas inmate who claimed intellectual disability to avoid execution was given a lethal injection Wednesday, 12 years after admitting to fatally stabbing his wife and two stepsons and raping his two stepdaughters.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Robert-Sparks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
