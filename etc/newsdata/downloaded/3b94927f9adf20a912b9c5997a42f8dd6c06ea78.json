In the last year, journalists at Bloomberg, Forbes, and The Guardian have all leveled that charge. (A Bloomberg article actually supports it.) With its 2020 election policy, \u201cHelping to Protect the 2020 Elections,\u201d Facebook might be shaping up to be something akin to the Ministry of Truth from Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four.\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Truth \u2014 Minitrue, in Newspeak\u2026 was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air.\u201d \u2013 George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four\n\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s social media giant is acting like \u201cBig Brother\u201d in three critical ways: 1) It\u2019s appointing itself as the mediator of truth and acceptable speech. 2) It\u2019s creating a hierarchy with different rules for politicians. 3) It\u2019s stamping out anonymity in political speech.\n\nFacebook Wants to Be Your Big Brother\n\nNot sure how to sift out the truth from all the opposing claims in political dialogue? Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ve got a \u201cBig Brother\u201d looking out for you. His name is Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nFacebook\u2019s 2020 election plan says:\n\n\u201cOver the next month, content across Facebook and Instagram that has been rated false or partly false by a third-party fact-checker will start to be more prominently labeled so that people can better decide for themselves what to read, trust and share.\u201d\n\nBut who fact checks the fact-checkers? And where is Facebook getting these supposedly omnipotent people who have no biases of their own and aren\u2019t prone to error themselves?\n\nReferencing a New York Times expose on Facebook last November, Forbes Contributor Kalev Leetaru writes:\n\n\u201cFar from the public image of a utopian and benevolent humanitarian effort to bring the world together and create a more informed society, the Times\u2019 expose paints a portrait of an ordinary for-profit company leveraging its immense size to \u2018delay, deny and deflect.'\u201d\n\nThe internet\u2019s great promise to users was a place free from centralized mediation of what\u2019s true and what isn\u2019t. Anyone can say anything, and it\u2019s the responsibility of the individual to exercise discernment and to fact check claims themselves.\n\nFacebook is turning that vision on its head.\n\nFacebook\u2019s 2020 Election Plan Is Content Apartheid\n\nWhile subjecting the proletariat to the tyranny of faceless third-party fact-checkers in the backrooms of Silicon Valley, Facebook is exempting politicians from this treatment. Facebook is continuing to allow politicians to blatantly lie in political ads.\n\nThat creates a stratified environment for political speech. It\u2019s like the society in Nineteen Eighty-Four, which has a proletariat class and then Party members with special privileges.\n\nConfounding the problem, Facebook subjects what it considers \u201cpolitical\u201d content that isn\u2019t a campaign ad by a registered political candidate to additional scrutiny, including suppressing ad reach. This has become incredibly murky as Emily Bell reported in The Guardian last year. Facebook is suppressing all kinds of content using a very broad definition of what it considers political.\n\nTrampling Anonymity Is Orwellian\n\nFacebook uses the term \u201ctransparency\u201d in an Orwellian fashion to describe the trammeling of anonymity in political discourse. In its 2020 election plan, the company touts its new policy of:\n\n\u201cMaking Pages more transparent, including showing the confirmed owner of a Page.\u201d\n\nBut that could have a chilling effect on free speech about politics. What if someone is afraid to voice their opinion because of possible reprisals from employers or others they work with in their industry?\n\nCertain regions and industries, like Hollywood, are impossible to be openly conservative in. In other industries and areas of the country, someone may find their livelihood equally threatened by being vocally progressive.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Founders highly valued anonymity. The Federalist Papers were written anonymously under a pen name. So were many political editorials in newspapers that were penned by the Founders.\n\nFacebook is stamping out this key ingredient to relevant political speech. Like the government in Nineteen Eighty-Four, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company is putting everyone under the watchful eye.\n\nDouble plus ungood.", "description": "With its 2020 election policy, Facebook is shaping up to be the Big Brother George Orwell warned you about in Nineteen Eighty-Four.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/zuck-ap.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
