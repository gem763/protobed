Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMurray, who won his first ATP tour singles encounter in nine months at Zhuhai last week, was made to fight for two hours and 52 minutes and won consecutive tour matches for the first time since his hip resurfacing surgery in January.\n\nThe Scot beat eighth-seeded Italian Matteo Berrettini 7-6(2) 7-6(7) in the first round on Tuesday and now meets world number five Thiem who beat Chinese wildcard Zhizhen Zhang 6-3 6-3.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really tired, I just had a sleep before coming,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve had to do that since I came back. It\u2019s something that I need to kind of get used to again, especially playing at this level and that intensity.\n\n\u201cIt was a good step for me, it\u2019s great that I won the match. Whether I\u2019d won or lost it, I was able to come out... and be competitive and play some good tennis... I\u2019m happy I\u2019ve got the day off tomorrow to recover.\u201d\n\nNorrie served poorly compared to the former world number one but 32-year-old Murray only managed to convert four of 13 break points in the match.\n\nServing for the opening set at 5-3, Murray was broken by Norrie, who then saved three set points in the ensuing tiebreak before he double faulted on the Scot\u2019s fourth set point.\n\nNorrie turned the tables in the second and, although Murray saved a set point on serve, the 24-year-old ranked 69 in the world then held his nerve in the tiebreak.\n\nMurray then switched tactics, coming up to the net more often to dictate rallies and shorten points, and won the first five games in a row to set up a meeting with Thiem.\n\nThe Austrian fired five aces, won 84% of his first service points and needed only three breaks to beat Zhang in 69 minutes.\n\nItaly\u2019s Fabio Fognini beat Russian Andrey Rublev 6-3 6-4 to set up a quarter-final clash with fourth seed Karen Khachanov, who dispatched Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 7-6(0) 7-6(5).", "description": "Andy Murray extended his winning run in Beijing by beating fellow Briton Cameron Norrie 7-6(6) 6-7(4) 6-1 on Wednesday to seal a spot in the China Open quarter-finals where he will face top seed Dominic Thiem of Austria.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436255891&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9111L-OCASP"}
