As soon as they get the bottom line, service goes out the window.\"\n\nAs an investor who often bought off-market, he said he liked the idea of being \"hit up\" as soon as a listing matched your criteria and budget.\n\nMr Bogut said he would promote Listing Loop through his sporting contacts \u2013 this year the NBA veteran is playing locally for the Sydney Kings \u2013 and also through social media \"where I get a bit of attention\".\n\nMr Dallwitz said the idea behind Listing Loop was to centralise off-market listings so buyers had access to offerings across all agencies.\n\n\"Currently, to get pre-market listings, you have to ring up each agency and get added to their databases. There's a lot of system breakdown because agents don't have a system to manage off-market sales,\" he said.\n\nMr Dallwitz said Listing Loop was not trying to be an REA or Domain, which he called \"fantastic businesses\", but said his own research had identified that between 10 and 30 per cent of sales in the inner city were done off-market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Sellers are keen to sell, but upfront marketing costs are a big overhead. For some, it's a question of where do they find $5000 to $10,000,\" he said.\n\nMore than 650 estate agents have signed up to the Listing Loop platform, he said.\n\nIts main competitor is another off-market matching platform, Property Whispers, which allows vendors to list property themselves for $49, or through an agent.", "description": "The basketball star said he would promote Listing Loop through his sporting contacts and also through social media \"where I get a bit of attention\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5949%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_137%2C$y_176/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/06b89d32da7f905fa018620c2f91f8d10e121ab9", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
