PG&E plans to shut off power for more than 800K customers in California to reduce wildfire risk", "language": "en", "text": "More than 800,000 subscribers in California will be left in the dark for days as the state's leading utility shuts off power to parts of 34 counties to reduce the risk of wildfires in dry and windy conditions.\n\nPacific Gas and Electric said blackouts across parts of northern, central and coastal California would start early Wednesday morning shortly after midnight in the largest preventive outage in state history.\n\nBecause every customer account could represent service to multiple residents or employees in a business, the number of people affected by the outages could be in the millions.\n\nWith winds between 40 mph and 70 mph expected Wednesday and Thursday, PG&E is trying to avoid downed power lines or contact with vegetation setting off fires. Some of California\u2019s most destructive blazes in recent years were started by PG&E power lines.\n\nNearly all nine counties in the San Francisco Bay Area could be subjected to the shutdowns, the only exception being the city and county of San Francisco.\n\nIn addition, Southern California Edison said more than 100,000 customers could face power cuts in eight counties it serves, including more than 30,000 in Los Angeles County.\n\nClass-action lawsuit: Was California wildfire caused by Pacific Gas & Electric?\n\nMichael Lewis, senior vice president of PG&E\u2019s electric operations, said it could take \u201cseveral days to fully restore power after the weather passes and safety inspections are completed.\u201d\n\nThe beleaguered utility, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year after a series of wildfires left it with billions of dollars in liabilities, further incurred its customers' wrath when its website crashed amid heavy traffic, preventing subscribers from finding information about the blackouts.\n\nThe threat of wildfires due to hot weather and windy conditions has led two California utilities to warn hundreds of thousands of customers of possible power shutdowns. More\n\n\u201cThis is shaping up to be one of the most severe dry wind events we\u2019ve seen in our territory in recent years,\" PG&E said in a statement. \"We want our customers to be prepared for an extended outage that may last several days.\"\n\nAccuWeather noted that while some Santa Ana wind events usher in hot and arid air, the winds affecting most of California this week should bring in somewhat cooler air that could ease the threat of a major wildfire outbreak.\n\n\"However, the combination of dry air, dry brush and gusty winds will significantly raise the chance of wildfire ignition,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.\n\nPG&E's meteorological and operations teams were monitoring the \"evolving situation\" and were working with state and local agencies to prepare the public, Lewis said.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe warned that customers may be affected by a power shutoff even if they are not experiencing extreme weather conditions in their specific location because of the way power lines work in unison across cities, counties and regions.\n\nTransportation officials also prepared for a possible full closure of the San Francisco Bay Area's Caldecott Tunnel, which more than 160,000 commuters use daily, because of the shutoff. While CalTrans is working with PG&E to provide emergency power to the tunnel, the agency said it may close as soon as Tuesday evening and remain blocked for up to five days. The Tom Lantos Tunnel in Pacifica may also be temporarily closed to traffic, CalTrans said.\n\nResidents of the Golden State lined up at gas stations and headed to stores to buy generators, flashlights, batteries and non-perishable food.\n\nJennifer Siemens, whose home burnt down in a devastating fire in the Northern California town of Paradise that was blamed on PG&E transmission lines, said she's now renting in nearby Oroville and is preparing for her third power shutdown in a month.", "description": "Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison may shut off power for nearly a million customers in an effort to prevent wildfires.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Jorge L.
