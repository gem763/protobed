We don\u2019t want either of them to get off scot-free. But now the children just want to get on with their lives,\u201d the friend said.\n\nAdvocate Jennifer Cronj\u00e9, for the state, reportedly argued in closing statements that a prison sentence of 25 years wouldn\u2019t be long enough for the man. She also argued the wife\u2019s sentence can\u2019t be softened just because she\u2019d been an \u201cabused woman\u201d.\n\nBoth the husband and wife had troubled childhoods, the court heard. But Bronwynn Stollarz, a psychologist and the state\u2019s expert witness, testified the man is a \u201csadistic psychopath\u201d and should be sentenced accordingly.\n\nThe couple\u2019s eldest son said in a statement he never wants to see his parents again and that he wants them to go to jail \u201cfor a long time\u201d. He also said it\u2019s their fault he and his siblings are in orphanages or foster care.\n\nThe eldest brother and sister are in foster care, while the three youngest children are in an orphanage, according to the family friend YOU spoke to.\n\nJudge Jordaan found the couple guilty on several serious charges in August. The charges against the husband included child abuse and neglect of the couple\u2019s five underage children, attempted murder of his eldest son (then 11), as well as raping his eldest daughter (then 16).\n\nHe was also found guilty on drug possession charges, as well as defeating the ends of justice.\n\nThe wife was eventually found guilty of child neglect and defeating the ends of justice.\n\nTo protect the underage children, the couple\u2019s names have been withheld ever since they were arrested in May 2014.\n\nPolice had been called to the couple\u2019s home in Springs on Gauteng\u2019s East Rand after the eldest son had managed to escape and run for help at the neighbour\u2019s house.\n\nIt later emerged that the father had held his wife and children captive in their home for years.", "description": "The children of the so-called Springs monster and his wife crave a normal life.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8005/002c7a75398248d7a380791b9be6e97d.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-02"}
