However, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the deal last year, arguing it did not go far enough, and reimposed sanctions.\n\nTehran responded with two separate moves that breached some of the terms of the deal, although it says it still aims to save the pact.\n\nRouhani had threatened to take further measures by Sept. 5 unless France and the other European signatories of the pact did more to protect Iran from the impact of the U.S. penalties.\n\n\u201cI think it is unlikely that we will reach a result with Europe by today or tomorrow ... Europe will have another two months to fulfill its commitments,\u201d Rouhani said, according to state TV.\n\n\u201cThe talks between Iran and European countries are moving forward ... but we have yet to reach a conclusion,\u201d he added.\n\nIran would continue with plans to breach the pact further and accelerate its nuclear activity, Rouhani said, without giving a fresh deadline.\n\n\u201cThe third step (in reducing Iran\u2019s commitments) will be the most important one and it will have extraordinary effects,\u201d state TV reported him as saying.\n\nTANKER CREW MEMBERS RELEASED\n\nIran\u2019s vital crude oil sales have plummeted by more than 80% under the U.S. sanctions.\n\nFILE PHOTO - The Iranian flag flutters in front the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) headquarters in Vienna, Austria July 10, 2019. REUTERS/Lisi Niesner\n\nThe remaining signatories of the deal have been working to save an agreement that they say will bring Iran back into the international fold and prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb.\n\nIran has repeatedly said its nuclear program is for electricity generation and other peaceful purposes.\n\nIn a possible olive branch to the West, Iran state TV said authorities would free seven crew members of the detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero.\n\nThe Swedish-owned tanker was detained by Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards on July 19 in the Strait of Hormuz waterway for alleged marine violations, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar. That ship was released in August.\n\nIran\u2019s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi appeared to back the main terms of the French proposal in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur return to the full implementation of the nuclear accord is subject to the receipt of $15 billion over a four-month period, otherwise the process of reducing Iran\u2019s commitments will continue,\u201d the semi-official news agency Fars quoted Araqchi as saying.\n\n\u201cEither Europe has to buy oil from Iran or provide Iran with the equivalent of selling oil as a credit line guaranteed by Iran\u2019s oil revenues, which in some sense means a pre-sale of oil,\u201d Araqchi added.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nGovernment spokesman Ali Rabie said Iran would stick to its nuclear commitments \u201cif France can get the approval of the U.S. and announces it.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they cannot get the approval, then we will take the third step.\u201d\n\nThe United States would have the economic clout to block any credit line for Iran. Washington has not commented on the proposal which would contradict its stated policy of imposing \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d to force Tehran to rein in its nuclear and missile programs as well as what the White House views as its destabilizing regional behavior.\n\nIran\u2019s English-language Press TV issued a short report stating: \u201cIran has rejected a $15 billion loan offered by EU\u201d - though Western and Iranian sources had described the French plan as the offer of a credit line, not a loan. Precise details of the plan have not been made public.", "description": "Iran's President Hassan Rouhani gave European powers another two months to save a 2015 nuclear deal on Wednesday, but warned that Tehran was still preparing for further significant breaches of the agreement if diplomatic efforts failed.", "authors": ["Parisa Hafezi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426033124&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830GB"}
