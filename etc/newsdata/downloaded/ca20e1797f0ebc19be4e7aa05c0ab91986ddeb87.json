REUTERS/Lisi Niesner\n\nDUBAI (Reuters) - A senior Iranian official confirmed on Wednesday that Tehran would return to its nuclear deal commitment only if it got $15 billion for oil sales over four months, as stipulated in a draft French plan to salvage the accord, the Fars news agency said.\n\nFrance has proposed offering Iran about $15 billion in credit lines until year-end if Tehran comes fully back into compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal, a move that hinges on Washington not blocking it.\n\n\u201cOur return to the full implementation of the nuclear accord is subject to the receipt of $15 billion over a four-month period, otherwise the process of reducing Iran\u2019s commitments will continue,\u201d Fars quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi as saying.\n\n\u201cEither Europe has to buy oil from Iran or provide Iran with the equivalent of selling oil as a credit line guaranteed by Iran\u2019s oil revenues, which in some sense means a pre-sale of oil,\u201d Araqchi added.\n\nIran\u2019s vital oil sales have plummeted since the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal last year and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.\n\nBut Araqchi said there were still \u201cserious disagreements on the agenda\u201d of any future talks between Iran and its nuclear deal partners.", "description": "A senior Iranian official confirmed on Wednesday that Tehran would return to its nuclear deal commitment only if it got $15 billion for oil sales over four months, as stipulated in a draft French plan to salvage the accord, the Fars news agency said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426033124&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830GB"}
