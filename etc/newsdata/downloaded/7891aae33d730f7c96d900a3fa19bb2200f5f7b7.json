I even went to see [the psychiatrist] Steve Peters at one point. But in the end, you know, it just felt like the right time\u2026 Sky were going in a completely different direction with Ineos coming in. I\u2019d been working with Dave [Brailsford] for 18 years, which is incredible really. And you get comfortable don\u2019t you? Fran [Millar, chief executive], Tim [Kerrison] Carsten [Jeppesen, head of technical operations], that whole gang...\u201d\n\nUltimately, Ellingworth says, it was nothing to do with Sky or Ineos or any of the people there, who he describes as \u201clike family\u201d. \u201cI wasn\u2019t p----d off. It was fine. It was just starting to feel a little bit Groundhog Day. I wasn\u2019t as motivated by the new challenge as I should have been. I needed something new.\u201d\n\nIt has been six months since that decision. Ellingworth, who was initially placed on gardening leave by Sky, has not said anything in public since.
