But in reality, it more often looks like your older brother's hand-me-down \u2014 a deflated cotton parachute you need to be cut out of.\n\nEverlane's $60 Silky Cotton Oversized Shirt is the affordable exception to this rule. It's tapered where it should be (your arms, your sides) and voluminous where it should be (your back) so you don't lose your shape entirely. Thanks to smart pleating across the shoulder blades, the \"oversized\" effect is achieved mostly through draping, so it doesn't balloon out indiscriminately when tucked in. In the end, the fit is relaxed and refined.\n\nPleating along the shoulders gives you the oversized look without adding bulk to your frame. Everlane\n\nMy Blue Indigo shirt also has a slight luxe sheen to it, thanks to the \"Silky Cotton\" that makes it feel smoother and slicker than traditional cotton. Like all cotton, it's cooling and soft. It's also easy to care for; machine wash it, and if you're feeling attentive, tumble dry low. I typically skip the latter, and it's survived intact in texture and color thus far.\n\nIt's a classic, so it comes in classic colors \u2014 black, blue indigo, off-white, and grey and white pinstripes. It's lightweight, so I can't speak to the sheerness of lighter colors, but I can wear black undergarments underneath the Indigo without issue. It's true to size, and comes in sizes 00 through size 16.\n\nWhile you can find cheaper button-ups elsewhere, I haven't found a better option for an oversized fit. There are more expensive options \u2014 like Ayr's $125 Deep End shirt \u2014 but this is the best option I've found for the price.\n\nOverall, it's the shortcut for a closet staple that's easy to do incorrectly. Per Everlane's description, it is, in fact, \"that perfect button-down you can never find, found.\" It's got the breathability and softness of something you'd scout secondhand stores for, and the intuitive design that's most successfully found in of-the-moment production.", "description": "Everlane's $60 Silky Cotton Oversized Shirt is the perfect iteration of the oversized button-up \u2014 not too big, not too small.", "authors": ["Mara Leighton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d964ab7194f09001e1e5b17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
