Every year, the ocean waters soak up about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emissions that arise from human activities.\n\nImage copyright zhuxiao45924648 Image caption Glaciers are now melting all over the world\n\nSince 1970, the oceans have absorbed more than 90% of the extra heat that's come about through global warming. If they hadn't taken in that warming, the surface of the planet would have been devastated by excess heating.\n\nAll this absorption has come at a price though. Our seas are now warmer, less salty and more acidic as a result.\n\n\"The reality is that we have been quietly reliant on the ocean to do these things, but there comes a point where the ocean changes because of the scale of what we are doing,\" Prof Dan Laffoley, from the International Union to Conserve Nature (IUCN) told BBC News.\n\nHow is warming changing our relationship with the oceans and ice?\n\nThe heating of the world is having a profound impact on all things frozen. So the IPCC report will look at the loss of ice from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets as well as from glaciers on mountains around the planet.\n\nIt will chart the rise of CO2 that is making the waters more acidic and more difficult for sea life. It will also link the warming to the rise of \"superstorms\".\n\nOne of the big changes has been in the impact of warming on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which has grown substantially in recent decades.\n\nThese frozen regions are critically important for global sea levels, which impact flooding around the world.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAs documented by my colleague David Shukman, this year has been one of record melting on the gigantic frozen island of Greenland.\n\nIn one day alone it lost 12.5 billion tonnes of ice.\n\nAntarctica has also enormous capacity to raise the waters around the world.\n\nAccording to studies, the amount of ice lost from the vast frozen region increased six-fold per year between 1979-1990 and 2009-2017.\n\nWill this report be all about sea level rise?\n\nIt is likely that much of the report will focus on the growing threat posed by rising sea waters. There is an expectation that some of the existing predictions for sea level will be revised upwards, with the threat posed to small island states and large cities increasing substantially by the middle of this century.\n\n\"By the end of this century, and if current adaptation efforts are not substantially scaled up, we must expect high levels of risk on low coasts such as atoll islands like the Maldives, and some Arctic communities even in a low-emission scenario,\" said Alexandre Magnan, a research fellow at the policy research institute IDDRI in Paris, and a co-author of the IPCC Ocean Report.\n\nImage copyright SPL Image caption Low-lying small island states will be badly hit by sea level rise\n\n\"In a higher-emission scenario, even wealthy megacities such as New York or Shanghai and large tropical agricultural deltas such as the Mekong will face high or very high risks.\"\n\nThe estimations for the centuries beyond 2100 will be even more stark, with suggestions that sea level rise could be 100 times higher than today.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The threat of flood damage is likely to accelerate over this century\n\n\"What happens with sea level rise is not disconnected with what happens with warming,\" said Jane Lubchenco, former administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) and a co-chair of the expert group of a High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy.\n\n\"Because the ocean is warming we are getting more intense storms, because the ocean is rising the impact of storm surge from those storms has much more potential.\"\n\nWhat other impacts on the seas will the report look at?\n\nIt will also look at the increase in marine heat waves, these could increase by a factor of 50 by 2100. This will have big implications for ecosystems and will increase coral bleaching.\n\n\"Extreme sea level events, such as surges from tropical cyclones, that are currently historically rare, for example today's hundred-year event, will become common by 2100 under all emissions scenarios,\" said Jean-Pierre Gattuso, an IPCC author and a CNRS Research Scientist at Sorbonne University.\n\n\"This will have with major consequences for many low-lying megacities and small islands.\"\n\nHowever the report will also look at ocean acidification, and will show how climate change is changing the balance.\n\nThere will also be sections on coral reefs, and there will also be a focus on fishing and fish stock, which are likely to suffer dramatic declines.\n\nWhat about glaciers and frozen regions?\n\nFor people living in the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush, a warmer future means that at first they will get too much water from glaciers as they melt. Then there will be too little.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The melting of permafrost could add billions of tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere\n\nA report last year stated that two thirds of these giant ice fields could disappear by the end of the century without rapid emissions cuts. This could have huge implications for the millions of people living in the region.\n\nThe IPCC report will also document the threat posed by warming to permafrost.\n\nSome 30-99% of the Northern Hemisphere's permanently frozen soils could melt by the end of the century, freeing up billions of tonnes of CO2 which could in turn accelerate warming to a new, ever more dangerous level.\n\nSurely there are some positives in this report?\n\nYes - the report will also show that the oceans could hold some important solutions to the threats posed by climate change.\n\nThere is great scope for renewable energy systems based on the oceans while cutting carbon from shipping would be a major step forward. Planting more mangroves and sea grass could remove huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\nEven the potential to switch diets to get more of our protein from the oceans would likely help cut carbon.\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter.", "description": "Researchers from around the world meet to finalise a study on the impact of warming on oceans and icy regions.", "authors": ["Matt Mcgrath", "Environment Correspondent.
