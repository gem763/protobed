They were arrested 10 days after Canada, acting on a U.S. extradition request, detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, who is also the daughter Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said the State Department is assisting the detained Americans.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the detention of two U.S. citizens in China and the charges being brought against them by the provincial government,\u201d he said. \u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to assist U.S. citizens abroad and are monitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHarlan founded China Horizons as an educational exchange company in 2004 after teaching English in China with his wife, Kathrine, in 2002, according to the company\u2019s website. The company, based in Rexburg, Idaho, helps college students visit China and teach English as a second language here.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNow they help many more people be able to experience China to the fullest,\u201d the site says. \u201cJacob frequently travels from the USA to China to provide support for the teachers there.\u201d\n\nA GoFundMe page set up to help Harlan with legal costs says that police picked up him and his 8-year-old daughter, Viara, from their hotel in Weifang in eastern China.\n\nThey took Harlan\u2019s phone and computer and he was not allowed to contact his wife at home in Utah with their four other children for 48 hours, the post says. Then Viara was allowed to call her mother and leave China with a family friend.\n\nAD\n\nHarlan is still being held in a hotel near Zhenjiang, north of Shanghai, under police surveillance, the page says.\n\nAs part of China Horizons\u2019 business, Harlan \u201cmeets these groups at the airport, gets them situated in their new homes, troubleshoots for them throughout their stays,\u201d the page says.\n\nAD\n\nPetersen is the company\u2019s director, based in Rexburg, and a student at Brigham Young University at Idaho, according to a GoFundMe page her parents set up. She has been traveling to China for a decade, including for China Horizons.\n\nShe was detained on Sept. 27 and has been held in a jail in Zhenjiang ever since, her parents said. She has had no contact with anyone apart from a consular officer, who is allowed to see her only once a month, they said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAlyssa has been [formally] charged with \u2018Illegally moving people across borders\u2019 which is a bogus charge as she has been doing this for 8+ years with no issues,\u201d her parents wrote.\n\nChinese officials taped and monitored the conversation, her father, Clark Petersen, told EastIdahoNews.com.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of fear at first. We are Latter-day Saints, [so] we\u2019ve fasted and prayed for her, and we\u2019ve felt peace knowing that she is going to be OK,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nChina Horizons will close its business at the end of this month, according to a post on its Facebook page, saying, \u201cWe are no longer able to send teachers to China safely.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of the changes that are taking place in China right now, the owner, Jacob Harlan, and the director, Alyssa Petersen, have been detained in China for 13 days now and may be so for the next few months or years,\u201d it said. \u201cThey are being charged for bogus crimes, and their families are working on getting them international lawyers to help them get back home to the states.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The two ran China Horizons, a company helping college students teach in China.", "authors": ["Anna Fifield", "Beijing Bureau Chief."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VEF0XTYndFwtWl8pBX3FSVZqc94=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/H7WL3LXQ3MI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
