HOANG DINH NAM/AFP/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe first brewery in Hanoi opened in the 1890s, when the French controlled the city.\n\n\"The French brought the beer drinking culture to Vietnam,\" says MacDouall. \"Before that, [people drank] rice wine.\"\n\nAfter the Hanoi beer brewing factory was set up, beer culture caught on quickly.\n\nToday, Vietnam is one Asia's biggest beer-drinking nations, consuming 3.8 billion liters a year in 2016, according to Ministry of Industry and Trade.\n\n\"It evolved through workers [who enjoyed beer] after a hard day's work,\" says MacDouall. \"It was also curiosity -- people wanted to see what Westerners were drinking.\"\n\nRelated content Find out what's new with Hanoi street food\n\nAt the time, however, the beer was expensive, marketed to the city's upper crust.\n\nIt wasn't until the late 1950s that bia hoi was introduced as an affordable options for everyday citizens. A brewery opened on Ta Hien Street, selling the fresh lager at just a few cents a mug.\n\nThis local staple is a light and refreshing lager, with an alcohol content of less than 3%.\n\nThe idea? You can drink it for long sessions to cool off after working all day in Hanoi's sweltering temperatures.\n\n\"Some will actually say it is 'instant beer' like instant noodles, since it is made quickly and sold quickly,\" explains MacDouall.\n\n\"The alcohol content is low and that was because people wanted to consume it rapidly.\"\n\nOver the years, countless bars and restaurants have populated Ta Hien Street, bring with them swathes of tiny stools and metal tables that flank both sides of the sidewalk.\n\nAll new brews\n\nIn the evening you sit at a roadside bar drinking excellent homebrewed Czech-style 'Bia Hoi' beer and watch as Hanoi's backstreets are converted into a living street theatre. Mark Eveleigh, CNN\n\nStill today, bia hoi is relatively affordable when compared with international labels. A glass of the light lager could set you back anywhere from 15 to 40 US cents.\n\nBut that's slowly changing.\n\n\"For local owners, selling bia hoi doesn't create enough money to sustain the business,\" says MacDouall.\n\n\"So they would rather sell bottled beer and focus on food. But if you still want bia hoi, this is where you come and get it.\"\n\nRelated content Hanoi after dark: 7 fantastic outings\n\nAnd if you want something other than lager?\n\nEnthusiasts can easily track down local microbreweries and craft beer bars that pour more creative concoctions.\n\nFurbrew , on the banks of West Lake, for example, serves a 'pho' beer that mimics the flavors of the famous dish with a malty, herby, slightly spicy recipe.\n\n\"This is probably the greatest example of the evolution of Vietnam,\" says MacDouall.", "description": "From bia hoi to craft brews, beer is at the heart of Hanoi street culture.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170405110255-bia-hoi-tease-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-27"}
