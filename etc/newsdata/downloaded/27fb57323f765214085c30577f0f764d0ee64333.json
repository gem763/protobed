The party said on its Facebook page that during a meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Pristina, Grenell wanted to hear its position on possibilities for an agreement to normalize relations with Serbia before he visits Belgrade on Thursday.\n\nKosovo, a former Serbian province, declared independence in 2008, a decade after a bloody 1998-99 war in Kosovo between ethnic Albanian fighters and Serbian forces. Belgrade still considers Kosovo to be Serbian territory, not a country.\n\nKurti, who is poised to become Kosovo's next prime minister, has said he is in no rush to restart formal talks with Serbia and won't lift the previous government's 100% tariff on Serb imports.\n\nThe White House last week said Grenell would serve as Trump's special envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations. European Union-mediated talks between the two countries broke down over a number of issues.\n\nOfficials in both Serbia and Kosovo welcomed the appointment as a sign of stepped-up U.S. engagement in the region.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's new special envoy to the stalled talks between Serbia and Kosovo made his first visit to the troubled Balkan region Wednesday.
