At least his campaign scheduled an evening of self-care with his rally on Thursday night at the American Airlines Center in Dallas. A MAGA highlight reel of the 87-minute speech is below, ranging from standard Trump insults to intensely callous comments on the new, disastrous chapter in the Syrian Civil War.\n\nThe U.S. should let the forces in northern Syria \u201cscrap a little.\u201d\n\nJustifying his decision to surprise-withdraw U.S. forces \u2014 abandoning Kurdish allies in northern Syria \u2014 after a phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, Trump said that \u201csometimes you have to let \u2018em fight a little while \u2026 like two kids in a lot \u2026 let \u2018em fight \u2026 and then you pull \u2018em apart.\u201d Trump did not mention that at least 300,000 have been displaced and 71 civilians have been killed following the withdrawal.\n\nThe Academy Awards are bad.\n\nFair enough. After a few insults lobbied at the press corps in attendance, the president said that the Academy Awards are failing because \u201cit had stupid people\u201d who opposed him. He made a similar statement in August, claiming that the ceremony had fallen \u201con hard times\u201d because \u201cthey started taking us on.\u201d\n\nDictators like him.\n\nAnother accurate depiction from the president:\n\nTrump says that foreign leaders, including \"dictators\" who don't like to go by the title dictator, always tell him, \"Sir, congratulations, sir, on what you've done.\" That story usually has only one Sir. \u2014 Daniel Dale (@ddale8) October 18, 2019\n\nLater, he would add that Turkish President Erdogan is a \u201cgentleman\u201d that just needs \u201ca little tough love.\u201d\n\nHis kids don\u2019t benefit from nepotism.\n\nUnlike Hunter Biden, the elder Trump children don\u2019t benefit from their father\u2019s station. Discussing Hunter\u2019s tag-along to China on Air Force Two in 2013 \u2014 in which he had a \u201csocial visit\u201d with a business partner on the official state trip \u2014 Trump asked, \u201cCan you imagine if Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump or Ivanka Trump \u2026\u201d He didn\u2019t finish the thought.\n\nTexas made a \u201cfortune\u201d after Hurricane Harvey.\n\n\u201cYou had a hurricane two years ago now. [Local GOP leaders] still keep calling me for money. \u2018Sir could you give us another \u2026 Thank you for being so generous to Texas, sir.\u2019\u201d Describing federal recovery money injected into the state, Trump said that \u201cyou made a fortune on the hurricane.\u201d The Category 4 storm in 2017 killed more than 100 and caused $125 billion in damages.\n\nAmerican presidents have wanted a deal with Turkey for \u201c15 years.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that the so-called ceasefire he arranged in northern Syria has been a goal of American foreign policy for 15 or 20 years, though the Syrian Civil War began in 2011.\n\nWind power means you can\u2019t watch TV if the wind isn\u2019t blowing.\n\nTrump still willfully misunderstands how wind turbines work, even though, as CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale notes, \u201cthe Energy Department has a whole thing on its website explaining that this thought is wrong.\u201d", "description": "President Trump held a campaign rally at the American Airlines Center in Dallas on Thursday, where he said that forces in Syria need to \u201cscrap a little\u201d and said that Hurricane Harvey made Texas a \u201cfortune,\u2019 though it killed over 100.", "authors": ["Matt Stieb"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/14/trump_rally.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
