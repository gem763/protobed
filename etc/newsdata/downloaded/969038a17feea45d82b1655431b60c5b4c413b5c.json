Researchers then compiled and analyzed the results.\n\nThe second source came from observations from 143 radar stations which can detect the flocks of birds during migrations that took place at night.\n\nMore than half of the North American bird species are migratory, flying either to the southern US or to Central and South America,\n\nThe radar information was less precise but also showed a decline of 13.6 percent between 2007 and 2017, with a margin of error of nine points.\n\nDucks and geese are the big exception: after a period of decline, their numbers have grown since 1970.\n\nThat is thanks to increased awareness among hunters who have supported protection measures, Rosenberg said.\n\nOrnithologists also mention other factors, such as cats left outside, and even birds dying after smashing into the windows of houses.\n\nThe number killed in this way is far from insignificant: researchers in 2014 estimated it at between 365 million and a billion per year.", "description": "Grassland birds are the most affected, because of the disappearance of meadows and prairies and the extension of farmland, as well as the growing use of pesticides that kill insects that affects the entire food chain.  \"We see the same thing happening the world over, the intensification of agriculture", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/c.ghaEyEpknS5a0BwuG_YA--~B/aD01MTI7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/f76faa5fb93306ac973729d3063ed008d9d808d4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
