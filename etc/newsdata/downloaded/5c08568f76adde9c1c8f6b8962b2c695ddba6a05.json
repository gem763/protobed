(Photo by Joshua Lott/Getty Images)\n\nA bill is pending vote in the California state assembly that could result in thousands of NCAA athletes being able to profit from their talents, and it now has two very notable supporters.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James tweeted a call to action Thursday in support of California SB 206, which would forbid colleges in the state from preventing student athletes from receiving compensation for use of their name, image or likeness.\n\nEveryone is California- call your politicians and tell them to support SB 206! This law is a GAME CHANGER. College athletes can responsibly get paid for what they do and the billions they create. \u2014 LeBron James (@KingJames) September 5, 2019\n\nA day later, Vermont Sen. and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders quote tweeted James with a simple message: \u201cCollege athletes are workers. Pay them.\u201d\n\nCollege athletes are workers. Pay them. https://t.co/PNEefTbS2O \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 6, 2019\n\nPer the U.S. News and World Report, this is surprisingly the first time Sanders has weighed in on the divisive matter of paying college athletes. However, his stance probably shouldn\u2019t be surprising to those familiar with his record.\n\nThe NCAA has made quite clear what it thinks about SB 206, having previously threatened to ban all California schools from national championships. California schools like Stanford aren\u2019t very thrilled about the idea either.\n\nThe bill has already passed through the California state senate by an overwhelming 31-5 vote, but could face a harder time in the assembly and on Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s desk. Politico reports that James only tweeted about the legislation in the first place because of worries that university lobbyists are closer to convincing Newsom not to sign the bill.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A bill awaiting vote in the California state assembly could trigger an upheaval in NCAA athletics.", "authors": ["Jack Baer", "Yahoo Sports Contributor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QPl864ZXgaEkEDUnbt3uSg--~B/aD0zODQwO3c9NTc2MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/3ee1c560-d116-11e9-abbe-b4a06d7a9b3d", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
