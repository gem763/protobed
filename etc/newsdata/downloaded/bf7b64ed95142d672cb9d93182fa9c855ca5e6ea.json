At one point during the Asian session, it slipped towards a session low of $8,168.85, consolidating within a strict range following its rebound from levels below $8,000 earlier this week. The lack of upside momentum raised fears for further bearish action, also visible in the dwindling trade volume noted across the past 24 hours.\n\nElsewhere in the cryptocurrency market, altcoins looked as weak as bitcoin. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, dipped by 1.50 percent in the past 24 hours, while XRP, the third-largest, slipped 1.02 percent. Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, and EOS also fell within the same range, showing that no new money entered the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWeak US Manufacturing Data\n\nBitcoin\u2019s fall matched shoulders with similar moves in the global equity markets. Earlier today, European markets delivered losses, with Europe\u2019s benchmark Stoxx 600 falling by 1.2 percent while UK\u2019s FTSE 100 dipped by 1.4 percent.\n\nThe markets borrowed sentiments from weak manufacturing activity across the developed economies. According to data released on Tuesday, the ongoing US-China trade dispute sent fears of recession across the global manufacturing sector. In the US, a key indicator recorded the lowest manufacturing activity in the last decade \u2013 to 47.8 in September from 49.1 in August.\n\nThe revelation sparked a sell-off in the equity market. US benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent to close at a one-month low and had dropped 1.24 percent after the market open today \u2013 as of this time of writing.\n\n\u201cEquity markets in Europe and the US now appear overvalued,\u201d Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note to clients on Wednesday. \u201cWhat is hard to argue with is that the global manufacturing sector is now very much in a recession. [It] now makes an already important Fed meeting later this month even more of a significant risk event.\u201d\n\nGold Outpaces Bitcoin\n\nThe plunge in risk-on equities sent investors looking for refuge in safe-haven assets. Gold prices were slightly higher upon the US market open, with OANDA reporting 0.86 percent gains in the yellow metal\u2019s spot rate as of 14:13 UTC.\n\nGlobal stocks plunge to 1mth low on US data shock.
