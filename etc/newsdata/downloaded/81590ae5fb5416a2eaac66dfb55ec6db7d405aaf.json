The judge consulted a doctor and turned down the request.\n\nKnown as Toufik, Mediene headed the all-powerful DRS intelligence agency from its foundation in 1990 up to his fall from grace in 2015.\n\nTartag, his deputy, succeeded Toufik and when the DRS was dismantled in 2016 he served as Algeria's security coordinator under the supervision of the presidency.\n\nPresidential elections have now been set for December 12, but protesters have kept up demands for political reforms and the removal of the former president's loyalists, including army chief Gaid Salah, who has emerged as Algeria's strongman since Bouteflika's fall.", "description": "An Algerian military court has sentenced the brother of former president Abdelaziz Bouteflika and three co-defendants to 15 years in prison, the state APS news agency reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9397/0b9db515168f4cee84a084a3747c1f40.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
