The bill was pulled in September, but the protesters have additional demands, including an independent inquiry on police brutality and the resignation of Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam.\n\nThese are understandable fears when dealing with a Communist regime like China\u2019s. And the NBA has long been known as perhaps the most free-thinking, outspoken league when it comes to the politics of its players. (Just last week, the governor of California signed a controversial bill into law on a television show hosted by LeBron James, arguably the league\u2019s most visible player.)\n\nHowever, the problem for Morey is that the Chinese also love basketball. And thanks surely to the stardom of former Rockets great Yao Ming \u2014 now the head of the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 Houston trailed only Golden State in popularity in the nation, per a recent survey. There appears to be too much money to be made in China for the NBA to stand up for human rights.\n\nYao himself responded to Morey\u2019s tweet with condemnation, calling it \u201can inappropriate comment related to Hong Kong\u201d and the CBA suspended its \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the Rockets. Chinese sportswear maker Li-Ning did the same, suspending its association with the team. The Chinese government also weighed in via its consulate, saying that it was \u201cdeeply shocked\u201d by the tweet. The Rockets owner, Tilman Fertitta, quickly disowned Morey\u2019s tweet:\n\nListen\u2026.@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Rockets and the NBA could have stood up for Morey, for decency, and for the protesters and their human rights. More than 2,000 have been injured in months of demonstrations that the Chinese government characterizes as \u201criots,\u201d but selling sneakers, jerseys, and the game But they instead folded all too readily, all too eager to hold onto the dollars that they glean from the Communist nation.\n\nThe NBA issued a sorry statement, declaring the league realizes that the tweet may have \u201cdeeply offended\u201d Chinese fans and that they \u201chave great respect for the history and culture of China,\u201d as if that had anything to do with a bill that could be used to disappear journalists and critics of an autocratic regime. Morey, who The Ringer reports was at one point in jeopardy of losing his job, tweeted his own apology that read like it was dictated by his boss. Brooklyn Nets owner Joe Tsai, a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba, published an open letter on Facebook that referred to protesters as a \u201cseparatist movement.\u201d Even James Harden, the Rockets\u2019 star guard, issued a mea culpa for some reason, even though he wasn\u2019t involved.\n\nThat last bit of rank submission to an autocratic regime captured the full extent of the NBA\u2019s sellout to China. Several politicians on the left and right, including presidential candidate Juli\u00e1n Castro and Rep. Ben Sasse (R-MO), called out the NBA\u2019s cowardice. Even Rockets fan Ted Cruz took a principled stand:\n\nWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale & the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) October 7, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all its MLK Day t-shirts and other symbolic gestures towards wokeness here in the States, this is still the league that sees fit to do business with a regime that represses human rights whenever given the chance.The league even has a presence in Xinjang, in the northwest of the country. It is the Chinese region where Slate reported last year the nation\u2019s authorities were holding roughly one million Muslims, the Turkic-speaking minority called Uighurs, in concentration camps. The NBA has a different kind of camp there \u2014 one of its three national training camps \u2014 in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Xinjang\u2019s capital.", "description": "Daryl Morey is now being forced to apologize because he... supports Democracy?", "authors": ["Jamil Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0GuhCEu2yw.ujDzUTGT..w--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/rollingstone.com/a11f027011920b018d693f5da86d3410", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
