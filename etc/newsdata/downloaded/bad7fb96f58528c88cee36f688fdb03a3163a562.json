All activities to reduce performance of others are referred to as sabotage.\n\n'For this reason, they [men] win more often, although men and women reach the same performance on the average.'\n\nDr Simon Dato, of Bonn University, said: 'We wanted to clearly show the gender difference in unethical conduct, i.e. sabotage, and understand the underlying mechanisms in order to develop countermeasures in the long term.'\n\nWhile men sabotage more, they also systematically over estimate the sabotage threat against them - leading researchers to conclude this was the reason for men's propensity for sabotage.\n\nWomen, by contrast, realistically assess the sabotage level.\n\nProfessor Nieken said: 'Women and men do not have different moral values, but men more strongly perceive their environment as competitive.'\n\nThe researchers hope awareness of the sabotage 'mechanism' found in men and women will help reduce it happening in the work place\n\nWhen men are informed of the actual threat of sabotage against them (lower than they expected) they reduce their level of attack to match - causing the best person to 'win' and meaning women are not systematically disadvantaged.\n\nThe study suggested that in the real world sabotage could include depriving competitors of important information about customers or business partners, not informing others of meeting dates, or deleting the hard disk.\n\nProfessor Nieken said this finding could counteract sabotage taking place in the workplace.\n\nIt could allow companies to create awareness of male reaction to the perceived and often imagined threat of sabotage.\n\nShe added: 'It is the goal to promote the best. If the \"wrong\" person is promoted systematically, this is disadvantageous for both the losers and the company.'\n\nResults of the experiment are published under the title 'Gender Difference in Sabotage: The Role of Uncertainty and Beliefs' in the Experimental Economics journal.", "description": "A study by Bonn University in Germany found that, when people were pitted against one another in tests in which they were evenly matched, men were quicker to pay money to gain an advantage.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19784520-0-image-a-15_1571224946432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
