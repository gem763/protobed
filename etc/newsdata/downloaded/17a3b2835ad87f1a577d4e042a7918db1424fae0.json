Photo: Tom Fox/AP\n\nMany were moved last week when Brandt Jean, after seeing Amber Guyger get sentenced to 10 years in prison, asked if it was alright for him to hug his brother\u2019s murderer. The teenager crossed the courtroom and embraced the white woman and former Dallas police officer who shot and killed 26-year-old Botham Jean in his apartment; Guyger claimed to have mistaken the elder Jean\u2019s unit for hers, which was on the floor below, and the black man eating ice cream inside for a burglar. \u201cI think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that Botham would want for you,\u201d Brandt Jean said. Guyger sobbed in his arms. \u201cIf you are truly sorry, I know I can speak for myself, I forgive you,\u201d he added through tears of his own. Among those who wept along with the pair was Judge Tammy Kemp, who had presided over the trial. The spirit of grace was so overwhelming that she couldn\u2019t resist it, she told the AP in an interview published on Monday: Kemp stepped down from the bench, hugged Guyger herself, and gifted the convicted woman a Bible.\n\nThe controversy that erupted after these two exchanges focused mostly on the culture that valorized them \u2014 the racist norms that praise black forgiveness of white violence without demanding any changes to the society that produced them. Some lambasted Jean, whom they deemed too gracious and deferential in the face of another black man murdered by a police officer. Kemp\u2019s involvement was almost an afterthought, but of the two, best encapsulated why outrage marked so much of the response. For her part, the judge claims to have been surprised that people were bothered by what she did at all. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the anger,\u201d Kemp, who is black, told the AP. \u201cAnd I guess I could say if you profess religious beliefs and you are going to follow them, I would hope that they not be situational and limited to one race only.\u201d It\u2019s unclear as it is unlikely that Kemp has left the bench before to hug a person convicted of a crime, let alone tell that person \u201cthat, even given the fact that she murdered someone, God still loves her.\u201d That\u2019s because the grace Kemp practices almost certainly is situational, despite her claim to the contrary. And that\u2019s a problem, particularly given its absence where it\u2019s needed the most, and who it\u2019s being offered to here.\n\nIt\u2019s extraordinarily unique for the sibling of a murder victim to publicly forgive \u2014 let alone hug \u2014 the person responsible for their pain. But its uniqueness does not make a similar response from an agent of the American judiciary any more appropriate, especially when applied to a fellow agent of the state. On top of embodying the generosity granted by the state to its own agents in general, Kemp could easily be in a position soon to oversee an appeal of Guyger\u2019s conviction, about which her impartiality is now further in doubt. As is how widely grace actually gets practiced in her jurisdiction: There\u2019s boundless room for compassion in a criminal-justice system that owes much of its current breadth to racism and the persecution of poverty; plenty of it exists in Dallas County, where Kemp presides. Roughly 70 percent of the more than 5,000 inmates at the local jail have not been convicted of crimes, and many are there because they can\u2019t afford the bail money needed to walk free. Yet grace continues to elude these prisoners, even as advocacy groups accelerate efforts to buy freedom for poor, sick, or precariously employed inmates. These are the people for whom such generosity would be most impactful were it practiced with the non-situational abandon that Kemp suggests \u2014 and practiced as a matter of habit, not as a dramatic deviation from how civilian defendants are normally treated.\n\nBut instead, more than exemplifying grace, Kemp\u2019s actions have laid bare its lack where it might actually change an unequal system, rather that reassure an individual ex-police officer that her life is still worthwhile. Even its extension here seems conditional, in part, on Guyger\u2019s yearning for a Christian version of it: \u201cIf she wanted to start with the Bible, I didn\u2019t want her to go back to the jail and to sink into doubt and self-pity and become bitter,\u201d Kemp, a Christian, told the AP. The question then arises: What if Guyger had been openly Jewish or Muslim? Had she cast herself as an atheist disinterested in divine forgiveness but who repented anyway, rather than Christ-curious and seeking God\u2019s grace, would the same embrace and certainty of her salvation been offered? The prospect is as dubious as the propriety of evangelism being practiced in a court of law in the first place. Guyger is entitled to believe in whatever God catches her fancy. The partiality of a judge on this basis is a separate matter entirely.\n\nNone of this is divisible from Guyger\u2019s status as a white woman, which marks her as unique among the mostly male and disproportionately black and Latino arrestees who cycle through the system. The dearth of hugs, promises of forgiveness, and gifted Bibles that marks their experience casts doubt on the likelihood that her being white and crying openly and loudly throughout her trial, claiming to wish she\u2019d been killed instead of Botham Jean, played no role in her magnanimous treatment. These asymmetries are profound, but also present an opportunity. Radical grace is not likely a matter of practice in Kemp\u2019s courtroom at the moment. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be more thoroughly integrated into her jurisprudence moving forward. This can mean hugs and Bibles and vows of God\u2019s forgiveness to every defendant who stands before her. It can also mean refusing to demand cash bail to bankroll a racist system and punish the poor for being poor, and generally applying the same generosity to every defendant that she has to her fellow law enforcement official. The wide latitude given to American judges to do what they please makes her options virtually limitless. She just needs to decide to do so. What happens in her courtroom moving forward will say more about grace therein than anything concerning Amber Guyger.", "description": "Judge Tammy Kemp\u2019s decision to hug former cop and convicted murderer Amber Guyger tells us how our justice system works.", "authors": ["Zak Cheney-Rice"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/08/08-guyger.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
