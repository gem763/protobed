Bernie Sanders of Vermont collected in the past three months, and the $24.6 million that Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised. Warren, the populist senator from Massachusetts, has surged in recent months, in donations and surveys, and is now essentially tied with Biden for the lead position in most recent national and early-voting-state Democratic nomination polls.\n\nFor the second straight fundraising quarter, Biden was also outraised by South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who took in $19.1 million in contributions to his campaign over the past three months.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\n\u201cThis is a devastating number for Joe Biden,\u201d said a Democratic strategist who asked for anonymity in order to speak more freely.\n\nWith the kickoff primary and caucus voting just four months away, the strategist emphasized that \u201cthis is a time when candidates are supposed to be showing momentum and strength going into the early contests. This number shows that his operation is basically treading water and being left behind by more dynamic campaigns.\u201d\n\nAnother Democratic consultant, who also asked to remain anonymous, warned that Biden\u2019s fundraising figures \u201cshould raise some serious questions about whether Joe Biden has the chops to raise the money necessary to compete in a general election and whether he can excite the Democratic base that is giving is giving an enormous number of small-dollar contributions to other candidates.\u201d\n\nA longtime friend, adviser and fundraiser for Biden cautioned against reading too much into the third-quarter figures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relatively happy with the Biden numbers. Obviously they could always be higher,\u201d said Larry Rasky, who was a senior adviser on Biden\u2019s unsuccessful 1988 and 2008 White House runs.\n\nRasky said that raising funds wasn\u2019t \u201cthe top priority of the campaign\u201d over the past three months, as staffers concentrated on building up grassroots support.\n\n\u201cI think the numbers give them what they need to compete and try and win in February,\u201d he added. \u201cThird quarter numbers are tough historically for candidates and a candidate like Joe who may not have as big a grassroots base as Sanders and Warren. But the number get us there.\u201d\n\nAnd he predicted a more robust fundraising effort for the already-underway fourth quarter, spotlighting \u201cit feels that way to me already. There\u2019s more intensity as we start the quarter off.\u201d\n\nBiden has spent the better part of the primary season to date fending off attacks not only from President Trump, but from an array of primary rivals eager to take him down a peg. His poll numbers have remained strong in the face of it all, even as Warren's have risen. One question mark for Biden going forward involves his connection to the newly launched Trump impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump is under fire from Democrats over his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he urged Zelensky to investigate the Biden family over their business dealings in Ukraine. Critics say this amounted to seeking foreign assistance in a U.S. election.\n\nBut it's also cast a spotlight on the Bidens. Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president. Trump and fellow Republicans have questioned Biden's role pushing for the dismissal of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had been looking into corruption at the company (though the prosecutor was viewed by officials in several countries as himself corrupt).\n\nWhile Biden denies wrongdoing, a recent Monmouth University poll indicated that 43 percent of registered voters believe Trump\u2019s claim that Biden did pressure Ukrainian officials to keep them from investigating his son\u2019s business ties, with 37 percent not buying the president\u2019s allegations and one in five unsure. The survey also spelled trouble for Trump, with just four in 10 registered voters continuing to say that the president should be reelected, compared with 57 percent who say it\u2019s time to have someone new in the White House.\n\nBiden may soon have some outside help, however, as he battles for the Democratic nomination.\n\nTwo sources close to an effort to form a pro-Biden super PAC tell Fox News that the outside group could be formed in the coming weeks.", "description": "First, he lost his clear lead in the polls over the rest of the record-setting field of Democratic presidential contenders.
