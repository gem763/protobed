We take a look...\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe idea behind the Family Springboard mortgage is actually quite simple.\n\nInstead of gifting a deposit, the guarantor opens a Barclays 'Helpful Start' account linked to the mortgage, into which they deposit savings equal to 10 per cent of the price of the house.\n\nAfter the five years is up, the money in the account is returned with interest. The interest rate on the Helpful Start account tracks a margin of 1.50 per cent above the Bank of England Base Rate \u2013 currently 0.75 per cent - meaning savers get a 2.25 per cent return.\n\nBy way of comparison, the best buy five-year fixed rate savings bond is currently 2.75 per cent from Gatehouse Bank.\n\nThe idea is that in this time the homeowner will have paid down enough of their mortgage to be able to remortgage to a lower loan-to-value mortgage when the five years is up.\n\nAs an example, imagine a parent putting \u00a320,000 away to act as the deposit on their child's \u00a3200,000 house.\n\nAfter five years at an interest rate of 2.95 per cent, the homeowner will have paid off \u00a326,241 of the loan. This means they'd then be able to remortgage onto a standard 90 per cent loan-to-value deal, possibly at a slightly cheaper rate.\n\nAssuming base rate had stayed the same, the parent would then get their \u00a320,000 back - plus \u00a32,252 interest.\n\nHannah Bernard, head of Barclays Mortgages, said: 'Barclays' own research has shown that many first-time buyers view the money for a deposit as a gift that doesn't need to be paid back, therefore placing a significant levy on the Mum and Dad.\n\n'The Family Springboard mortgage has been specifically designed to remove the financial burden from parents and to ensure they receive their deposit with interest at the end of the five-year fixed-rate period.'\n\nHow it's changed\n\nWhile it was introduced in 2013 the deal didn't come with a deposit-free option until 2016.\n\nToday, the bank announced a further raft of changes.\n\nFirstly the fixed rate period has been extended from three to five years, with the term extending from 25 to 35 years.\n\nThis extended term will mean that potential first-time buyers will be able to borrow a larger sum as the loan is spread over a longer period. That brings down monthly repayments, although, if you take the full 35 years to pay off the mortgage then you will end up paying significantly more interest overall. This can be mitigated if you overpay your mortgage (within allowed limits) or shorten the term later when you come to remortgage.\n\nBarclays is offering a five-year fixed rate at 2.95 per cent for the no-deposit option and a five-year fixed rate of 2.75 per cent if the homebuyer has a 5 per cent deposit to put in on top of the 10 per cent savings.\n\nThere are no fees and the minimum loan size is \u00a35,000, up to \u00a3500,000.\n\nJonathan Harris, director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: 'Extending the term and product range will give more choice to customers and puts Barclays way out in front on this, particularly as it will lend 5.5 times income to borrowers with a joint income of more than \u00a350,000.\n\n'The maximum loan size of \u00a3500,000 links up nicely with the stamp duty threshold for first-time buyers and the rates are competitive.'\n\nThe interest rate on the linked account tracks a margin of 1.50 per cent above base rate\n\nHow does it compare?\n\nConsidering that deals of this type are few and far between, the rates on offer are actually fairly competitive.\n\nThe cheapest fee-free five-year fix at 90 per cent loan-to-value is Post Office Money's 2.06 per cent deal, followed by Bank of Ireland's 2.09 per cent deal - not a world away from what Barclays is offering with its Springboard mortgage.\n\nIn terms of how it compares to previous iterations of the deal, your view on this probably depends on whether you're the homebuyer or the guarantor.\n\nRates are slightly cheaper, 0.04 per cent, a lot considering the deals are now five-year fixes instead of three-year fixes.\n\nThe main advantage of a longer fix and longer term period is that borrowers will be able to take on bigger loans, as spreading out the mortgage for longer means the buyer can take on more borrowing.\n\nFor the gifters however, the new five-year fixes mean tying up savings for an extra two years.\n\nHarrison added: 'The biggest improvement is the extension of the term to 35 years. With most of these borrowers in their late 20s or early 30s, they have plenty of time to pay the mortgage back.'", "description": "The deals let family or friends of homebuyers pay the equivalent of 10 per cent of value of the home into a related savings account in lieu of a deposit.", "authors": ["Will Kirkman For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
