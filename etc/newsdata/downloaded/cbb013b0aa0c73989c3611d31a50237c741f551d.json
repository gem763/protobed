It is different from those earlier days; now we have different types of media \u2013 we have social media and more women are willing to talk about it, which makes it easier to reach a wider audience. It is the adage that if you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t be it.\n\nWhen I fell pregnant with my first child, Louisa, after London 2012, I was 35 years old and it could have been the end of my career. I had achieved everything I had wanted in sport and knew I would not have been unhappy if I was not able to return.\n\nI feel quite fortunate that I didn\u2019t feel any pressure to perform, because everything that happened prior to Louisa arriving was more than I could have dreamed of. Now it feels like I am on bonus time, which takes huge pressure off. It means that my performances can be fitted around the needs of the children.\n\nThe people who were part of the para-cycling programme, Christopher Furber, who now heads up the very successful para-swimming programme, and Gareth Sheppard, were very supportive and, alongside our performance director at the time, Dave Brailsford, gave me as much time as I needed.", "description": "There have always been mothers in sport, we just haven\u2019t celebrated them the way we do now.", "authors": ["Dame Sarah Storey", "Becky Downie"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/womens-sport/2019/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000213200734-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqN7kF8Fb6ID_G1m99xXXMy7T5LfTkYhqvBvjfatlPy1M.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
