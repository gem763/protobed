Munis have 2 major advantages, Fed tax free and \u201csafer\u201d than other categories and compared to other higher rated bonds they did much better.\n\nMulti- There is no magic, funds like PDIIX,STISX,PLSFX that made more YTD had HY and/or EM bonds. JGIAX is the next in line, mostly MBS but smaller % in HY than PDIIX,STISX,PLSFX and still did pretty well ST and LT. Basically, the following are ranked according to SD low to hi(PIMIX,JGIAX,PDIIX,STISX=PLSFX), a one year chart shows why PIMIX has the best risk/reward. For a huge AUM like PIMIX, one month at 0.9% was a nice return.\n\nBut as usual, all you need is one fund to the exception like EIXIX(link) which has 72% in RMBS + 14% in IO(interest only) MBS. MBS bonds work well when rates go down or steady but IO MBS work well when rates rise. The managers are using both to cover rates up/down/steady.\n\n===========================\n\nThe following is what I did last month and not recommended to anybody. Do your own DD.\n\nPIMIX (since early 01/2019) continues to be my largest holding; EIXIX and OPTAX(since late 02/2019) are not far behind. JGIAX is my newest position (early 04/2019) but much smaller % than the others. Stocks are doing great YTD but when many bond funds are doing 1% or more per month there in nothing to complain. I use(mainly trade) stocks instead of HY/EM bonds because a good trade that last days-weeks is worth months of bonds performance.\n\nInvestors, who don't mind and uderstand the risk, may use SEMMX+PUTIX as a cash sub LT (and never forget Munis).
