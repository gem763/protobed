Moreover, over the past three years, the company has witnessed 100% retention of the top 10 customers and 79% of the top 1000.\n\n\n\nThe company is focused on increasing its digital-display assets at prime locations and in sync with this, has resorted to acquisitions, expansions and conversions of static billboard displays to digital, which bode well for long-term growth. Moreover, with the expansion of footprint and reaching of technology platform to marketers, it is capitalizing on out-of-home (OOH) advertising\u2019s growth potential.\n\n\n\nOUTFRONT Media currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
