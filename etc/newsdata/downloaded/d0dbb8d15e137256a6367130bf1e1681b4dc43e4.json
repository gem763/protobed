In the video, a CNN logo appeared in place of Mr McMahon's head.\n\nImage copyright Twitter Image caption The 2017 video was originally submitted to a pro-Trump forum on the social media site Reddit\n\nUS media outlets, led by CNN, accused the president of inciting violence against the media.", "description": "The video shows a Trump figure attacking others tagged with names of news groups like the BBC and CNN.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6CAE/production/_109222872_gettyimages-1175479013-594x594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
