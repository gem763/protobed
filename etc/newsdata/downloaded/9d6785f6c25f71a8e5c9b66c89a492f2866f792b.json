But the federal government\u2019s actions since President Donald Trump took office in 2017 \u2013 including limiting asylum requests and separating children from families \u2013 have left border officials ill-equipped to respond and have put migrants at unneeded risk, creating a scenario that serves no one well, according to local government officials, immigration lawyers, longtime border residents and immigration policy experts.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been treated as a whole-government emergency response,\u201d said Theresa Brown of the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center. \u201cIt\u2019s been treated as a border security problem. That\u2019s exacerbated the problem.\u201d\n\nThis year, the sheer number of migrants who arrived \u2013 especially families \u2013 overwhelmed U.S. Border Patrol facilities. In the first six months of 2019, federal agents apprehended 534,758 migrants at the southwestern border \u2013 the highest six-month tally of any year since 2008, according to Border Patrol statistics.\n\nThe administration notes that apprehensions were down in August, year over year, and points to that as a sign that the Trump presidency has slowed the flow of immigration. But the consequences of the 2019 surge will ripple through the immigration system for years, and the administration\u2019s recent move to block asylum almost entirely seems certain, experts say, to put more migrants at risk.", "description": "", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Usatoday.Com In-Depth News Immigration-Crisis-Migrants-Us-Mexico-Border"], "top_image": ""}
