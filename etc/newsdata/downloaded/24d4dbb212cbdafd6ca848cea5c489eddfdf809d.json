Firefighters were battling the blaze.\n\nOther looters attacked a pharmacy, and there was an attempt to set a subway station on fire. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people attempted to get home from work on free buses sent to replace trains out of service due to the burning of dozens of stations over the last week in Latin America\u2019s most modern public transportation system.\n\nBy Monday evening the streets were mostly empty, with piles of detritus burning on street corners, and some residents and business owners trying to extinguish blazes with handheld fire extinguishers. At least a couple dozen glass storefronts were smashed and graffiti cursing Pi\u00f1era and calling for revolution was sprayed on virtually every building.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Hundreds of thousands are hobbled by educational loans that can follow them into their 40s and even 50s.\n\n\u201cLast Friday we had a peaceful protest and being peaceful they didn\u2019t listen to us,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n, a 25-year-old welder who declined to give his last name saying he fear authorities. \u201cYou have to get their attention somehow.\u201d\n\nAdding to protesters\u2019 anger was a military crackdown on demonstrations and looting that has left 1,132 hurt, with dozens partially blinded by police or soldiers\u2019 gunshot pellets, according to the National Human Rights Institute and the Chilean College of Medicine. The death toll from the 10 days of violence stands at 20, although it is unclear how many were killed by police and how many by looters.\n\nThe U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet, was sending a delegation to the country Monday to investigate the situation. Amnesty International was also sending a team.\n\nFrom afar, Chile has been a regional success story \u2014 under democratically elected presidents on the left and right, a free-market consensus has driven growth up, poverty down and won Chile the region\u2019s highest score on the United Nations Human Development Index, a blend of life expectancy, education and national income per capita. In 2010, Chile became the second Latin member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, after Mexico.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2017 UN report found that the richest 1% of the population earns 33 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth. That helps make Chile the most unequal country in the OECD, slightly worse than Mexico. Pi\u00f1era himself is a billionaire, one of the country\u2019s richest men.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Fresh protests and attacks on businesses erupted in Chile despite President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era's replacement of eight key Cabinet ministers", "authors": ["Michael Weissenstein", "Eva Vergara"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/chile_protest_looting_new_cabinet.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C4098px%2C2145px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
