Matters are rarely settled once and for all, for a lifetime with no time or space for further debate and reflection, and nor should they be.\n\nThe Brexit promised in 2016 bears no resemblance to the crash-out no-deal we now face. There is no mandate for no deal and no majority for it in either parliament or the country.\n\nCrashing out on WTO terms is a nonsense. The World Trade Organisation, the global body overseeing a rules-based system, is sadly now a weak, ineffectual organisation whose rules are widely flouted. It is being effectively destroyed by Donald Trump who has no time for international rules if they conflict with America First. WTO rules is the trading equivalent of abandoning the army and Nato and relying for our national security on speeches in the general assembly of the United Nations. We would be left with whatever trading relationships the Trump administration, the Chinese and our former friends in the EU decide to throw in our direction.\n\nBut our future as a country is now in the hands of 160,000 mainly English, mainly white, mainly male, members of the Conservative Party \u2013 many of whom didn\u2019t even vote for the party at the last election, opting instead for the Brexit Party.\n\nYou could be forgiven for thinking we have barely moved on from the rotten boroughs, riotous hustings and show of hands voting before the Reform Act of 1832.\n\nI have genuinely never understood the argument that it is in some way undemocratic to take the final decision on our future as a European nation back to another public vote.\n\nThe people did not vote for the kind of no-deal Brexit now favoured by Nigel Farage and the one that Boris Johnson is flirting dangerously with. There is certainly no mandate for that, nor was there a mandate for the blind Brexit negotiated by Theresa May that Jeremy Hunt might be tempted to revive. It promises years of uncertainty as we negotiate a new relationship from outside the European Union.\n\nUnder those circumstances, the idea that you simply plough on regardless and impose a Brexit on the UK that will jeopardise our future trading and security partnerships for generations to come is the most undemocratic outcome I can imagine.\n\nWhether you want Brexit to go ahead or would prefer to stay in, the only way to unlock the political impasse, secure a stable majority in parliament and legitimise the outcome is to let the people have the final say. As the Chartists might have said, let us be heard.\n\nVince Cable is the leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for Twickenham\n\nThe Independent\u2019s Final Say campaign, in partnership with the People\u2019s Vote organisation, has announced the Let Us Be Heard march will take place on Saturday 12 October \u2013 19 days before the UK is scheduled to leave the European Union on 31 October.
