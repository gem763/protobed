(Photo: Robert Falconer, The CW)\n\nRiverdale returns this week with a departure from the norm. The season four premiere centres around the death of Fred Andrews, played by the late Luke Perry. It\u2019s an episode that showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa is calling a \u201cmeditation\u201d on Perry\u2019s life, and one that fulfils a goal Perry had for the show: Reuniting with co-star Shannen Doherty.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, Aguirre-Sacasa shared more details about the upcoming season premiere, \u201cIn Memoriam.\u201d Perry died earlier this year after having a stroke and Aguirre-Sacasa chose to wait until season four to address it on the series. For the remainder of season three, Fred Andrews was away on business and Molly Ringwald\u2019s character stepped in as Archie\u2019s parental figure. But that was only a temporary fix.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to say Fred was on a business trip indefinitely, or never mention him again,\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a huge part of the show, and of Archie\u2019s story. We knew we\u2019d have to meet this challenge head-on.\u201d\n\nSome of the cast said it was difficult to film the episode, with co-star Skeet Ulrich (FP Jones) saying it was sometimes \u201cliterally almost impossible to utter lines.\u201d But they weren\u2019t alone. It was confirmed at New York Comic Con that Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Doherty appears in the episode in an undisclosed role \u2014 something that Perry had been trying to arrange for a long time.\n\nAguirre-Sacasa added that he considers the episode to be a tribute not only to the character of Fred Andrews, but also to Perry himself and the work he did on Riverdale, 90210, and so many other shows and films.\n\n\u201cLuke had been trying to get her on Riverdale for years, and the timing never worked out,\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa said. \u201cWe sent her the script and she said, \u2018I\u2019d love to be a part of this.\u2019 [The episode is] a meditation on what Fred meant to the town of Riverdale and what Luke meant to the cast and crew \u2014 and the audience that grew up watching 90210 and the audience that watches Riverdale.\u201d\n\nRiverdale returns with \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d this week. The series airs on Netflix in Australia.", "description": "Riverdale returns this week with a departure from the norm.
