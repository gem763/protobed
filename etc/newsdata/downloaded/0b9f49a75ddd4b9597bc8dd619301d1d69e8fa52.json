Jornet won in 4:46:05 and claimed the overall series too.\n\n\u201cThe course shows all the different landscapes \u2013 running through fields, forests, mountains,\u201d he said.\n\nOrganisers estimated the winner to complete the race in four hours but the course was far tougher than expected.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard race. It\u2019s a slow race,\u201d the Spaniard said. \u201cIt was technical. The downhill is when you have to full push, it wasn\u2019t scrambling, but it was big steps, roots, rocks. You really had to watch your feet.\u201d\n\nJornet won Zegama, Sierre Zinal and Pikes Peak events in the series.\n\n\u201cAll the races were amazing as they each have something, they are all historic,\u201d he said.\n\nBhim Gurung may have come second but took a wrong turn and appeared at the finish assuming he had won. Instead, he went back on the course and completed the final kilometres, adding 8km to his day. As a result, Davide Magnini finished second. He tried to stick with Jornet and managed it until halfway.\n\n\u201cIt was a hard pace,\u201d Magnini said. \u201cAt halfway on the climb, that is when we began to suffer. It was just awesome being able to share these intense moments with him [Jornet].\u201d\n\nBartlomiej Przedwojewski had finished fourth in three of the series races already but claimed third thanks to Gurung.\n\n\u201cI had no expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cI just managed to enjoy it but there was so much suffering.\u201d\n\nJudith Wyder was the first woman to finish and claimed the overall series title, even though this was the longest distance she had ever run.\n\n\u201cIn the end, I was just happy to get closer to the finish,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to finish. They said it would be different and it really was different. Crazy trails, crazy uphills, crazy downhills.\u201d\n\nWyder said the villages and support from the Nepalese was amazing. She looked fresh at the finish.\n\n\u201cI am really surprised energy wise,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that is because I had no expectations. I was just trying to enjoy myself.\u201d\n\nShe finished in 5:42:03, just four minutes ahead of Maude Mathys, who took a wrong turn early and had to claw her way back.\n\n\u201cOK, it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll just enjoy the landscape,\u201d Mathys thought. But then the organiser said she could still race if she went back for a particular climb.\n\n\u201cWhen he said I could still compete, it was motivation,\u201d she said. Ruth Croft finished in third place.", "description": "No one expected it to take that long, as the relentless climbs and technical trails put runners through their paces", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/25/ae9cf04e-f715-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_191203.jpg?itok=2YH3nmkt&v=1572001929", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
