Analysts have repeatedly cast doubt on the likelihood of the state oil giant reaching that target.\n\nThe IPO likely will launch in the first instance on the Riyadh-based Tadawul stock market. It is possible that it will then go abroad.\n\nOil and gas giant BP (BP.L) beat analyst forecasts for third quarter performance thanks to a strong performance at its oil refinery business.\n\nAdjusted income for the third quarter of 2019 was $2.25bn, BP said on Tuesday. That was down 40% on the third quarter of 2018 but well above the consensus analyst forecast of $1.7bn. The oil giant made a loss attributable to shareholders of $700m, driven by a $2.6bn tax charge in the quarter.\n\nShares in BP slipped by 0.8% at the open in London.\n\nOutgoing BP CEO Bob Dudley said in a statement: \u201cBP delivered strong operating cash flow and underlying earnings in a quarter that saw lower oil and gas prices and significant hurricane impacts.\n\n\u201cOur focus remains firmly on maintaining financial discipline and delivering safe and reliable operations throughout BP. We're also continuing to advance our strategy, making strong progress with our divestment plans and building exciting new opportunities in fast-growing downstream markets in Asia.\u201d\n\nThe African Export-Import Bank on Tuesday said it was delaying its listing on the London Stock Exchange, blaming \u201cunfavourable market conditions\u201d.\n\nThe move, which the bank confirmed would be going ahead only two weeks ago, comes amid increasing fears that Brexit uncertainty has dented the appeal of listing in London.\n\nThere have been 29 IPOs on the London Stock Exchange so far this year, compared with 55 in total last year.\n\nThe African Export-Import Bank, a trade finance group for Africa, was created in 1993 under the auspices of the African Development Bank.\n\nAlso referred to as Afreximbank, it was hoping to raise $250m from its IPO on the London Stock exchange, based on the issuance of global depository receipts, a type of certificate used as an alternative to actual company shares.\n\nUK property prices rose in October despite continued political turmoil as Britain edged closer to Brexit, new figures show.\n\nAnalysts also predicted prices could continue to rise, fuelled by low interest rates and \u201cpent-up demand\u201d which could be unleashed if uncertainty fades when Britain leaves the EU.\n\nThe latest house price index from Nationwide suggests average prices have grown by 0.2% over the past month, and are 0.4% higher than a year ago.\n\nThe average UK property was sold for \u00a3215,368, with price growth below 1% for an 11th month in a row.\n\nPrices are on average \u00a3800 higher than a year ago, compared with a \u00a39,100 increase over the same period to October 2016.\n\nRobert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide, said growth appeared to have slowed because of weaker global economic growth and an \u201cintensifying of Brexit uncertainty.\u201d\n\nEuropean stocks lower\n\nEuropean stocks fell on Tuesday, with the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) down 0.5%. Germany\u2019s DAX (^GDAXI) was declined by 0.2%, while France\u2019s CAC 40 (^FCHI) was down by 0.12%.\n\nThe pound edged lower on Tuesday after prime minister Boris Johnson failed in another bid to force a general election.\n\nThe pound was trading 0.3% lower against the dollar (GBPUSD=X) at around $1.28. It fell 0.2% against the euro (GBPEUR=X) to just below \u20ac1.16.\n\nWhat to expect in the US\n\nFutures are pointing to a mixed open for US stocks.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) are down marginally, as are Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F). Nasdaq futures (NQ=F) are up slightly.\n\nCompanies reporting later on Tuesday in the US include:", "description": "A daily overview of the top business, market, and economic stories to watch in the UK, Europe, and abroad.", "authors": ["Edmund Heaphy", "Finance", "News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/agdUdVHAoxOmeuImCsrMxg--~B/aD0zMzcxO3c9NTA1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5e1b6a60-fa30-11e9-bd4f-74094ae6cab0", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
