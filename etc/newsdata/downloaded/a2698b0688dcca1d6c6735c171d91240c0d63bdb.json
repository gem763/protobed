Not one second, not even a millisecond do I care about my popularity here,\u201d Krueger emphatically told The Associated Press earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI have zero fear in this job because I have nothing to prove to anybody other than I want this team to be successful and give back to the city,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that I\u2019m out to prove to people that I was an out-of-the-box hire.\u201d\n\nThis offseason\u2019s NHL coaching carousel featured seven changes. While it had the Florida Panthers landing the most highly-prized candidate in three-time Stanley Cup champion Joel Quenneville, the Sabres took the most intriguing approach in hiring Krueger to turn things around. The other changes have Dallas Eakins in Anaheim, Dave Tippett in Edmonton, Todd McLellan in Los Angeles, D.J. Smith in Ottawa and Alain Vigneault in Philadelphia.\n\nIn Buffalo, the Sabres essentially split the middle in choosing between hiring a so-called retread versus a first-timer by luring Krueger back to hockey after he spent the past five years running soccer\u2019s Southampton FC of the English Premier League.\n\nFrom Winnipeg, Manitoba, Krueger is not exactly a fresh new face though he is highly respected for the quarter-century spent in hockey on both sides of the Atlantic. He has coached Switzerland\u2019s national team, led Team Europe to a second-place finish at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, and was as a consultant for Canada\u2019s gold-medal team at the 2014 Winter Games.\n\nHe\u2019s also not exactly a recycled entity either, despite having spent 2012-13 coaching the Edmonton Oilers before being fired - via Skype of all things - following a 19-22-7 finish.\n\nIf Quenneville benefits from having instant recognition when walking into a locker room, Krueger focused on making a good impression on a Sabres lineup featuring a majority of players who weren\u2019t in the NHL when he was in Edmonton.\n\nHe began by reaching out to players by phone or personally, such as visiting with captain Jack Eichel and forward Sam Reinhart in Slovakia, where they competed at the world championships in May. And Krueger then gripped his players\u2019 attention during a pre-camp-opening speech which forward Kyle Okposo said was so impassioned several of his teammates were ready to run through a wall afterward.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got that presence about him,\u201d Okposo said \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of coaches, a lot of people, and I would say he\u2019s an alpha.\u201d\n\nKrueger regarded Okposo\u2019s impression of him as a compliment and believed it referred to the open line of communication he\u2019s established with players.\n\nThough Krueger prides himself for being always upbeat, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll avoid being critical.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a smiley, friendly guy,\u201d he said. \u201cPositive isn\u2019t always friendly. Positive is constructive. Positive is working toward solutions. So if a player gets sent down, there\u2019s an opportunity for him, too. And we\u2019ll be clear on why and what has to be worked on.\u201d\n\nKrueger spent his time away from hockey developing on-ice strategies, some of which he experimented with while coaching Team Europe. He emphasizes simplicity in allowing players to play to their strengths, and speed in always being focused on attacking the opposing zone.\n\nThough he has no regrets leaving hockey, the hiatus gave him time to realize how much he missed the game and dealing directly with players.\n\n\u201cMy kids, when they saw me at the World Cup of Hockey said, \u2018Dad, that was the happiest period you\u2019ve had in the last five years,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t happy, but it was more in my job, the energy, and that stuck with me.\u201d\n\nThe joy to be back behind a bench is reflected in messages he sends to his family in Switzerland.\n\n\u201cThe nicest thing I\u2019m telling them is I really feel at home,\u201d Krueger said.\n\nNEW FACES\n\nDallas Eakins, Anaheim.\n\nNHL coaching record: 36-63-14 (Edmonton, 2013-15)\n\nReplaces: Ducks GM Bob Murray, who finished season as interim coach after Randy Carlyle was fired.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cYou can already see it and feel it around the room that guys are ready to go, and guys are ready to turn that page,\u201d forward Adam Henrique said of Eakins, who spent past three years coaching the Ducks\u2019 AHL affiliate in San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun coming to the rink. He\u2019s here to work.\u201d\n\n___\n\nRalph Krueger, Buffalo.\n\nNHL coaching record: 19-22-7 (Edmonton, 2012-13)\n\nReplaces: Phil Housley, who was fired after two seasons.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cI think the thing that sticks out is the personality. He\u2019s somebody you want to be around, you want to be a better person around,\u201d captain Jack Eichel said. \u201cHe\u2019s very calculated, very smart. He knows what he wants.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTodd McLellan, Los Angeles.\n\nNHL coaching record: 434-282-90 (San Jose, 2008-15, Edmonton, 2015-19)\n\nReplaces: Willie Desjardins, who wasn\u2019t retained after replacing John Stevens early in the season.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cHe\u2019s just honest person. He said he don\u2019t care what you did before. He said you just have to show up and show everybody what you can,\u201d said forward Ilya Kovalchuk.\n\n___\n\nJoel Quenneville, Florida.\n\nNHL coaching record: 890-532-137-77 (St. Louis, 1997-2004, Colorado, 2005-2008, Chicago, 2008-2018)\n\nReplaces: Bob Boughner, who was fired after two seasons.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic for him to coach again. It\u2019s the right situation with his relationship with Dale,\u201d Devils GM Ray Shero said, referring to Panthers GM Dale Tallon, who worked with Quenneville in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s not cheap to get a guy like that. But you know what, it\u2019s an important market and they want to win.\u201d\n\n____\n\nD.J. Smith, Ottawa.\n\nNHL coaching record: None.\n\nReplaces: Interim coach Marc Crawford, who finished season after Guy Boucher was fired.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cD.J. did a really good job for us,\u201d said Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock, quoted in The Toronto Sun, referring to his former assistant. \u201cWe talked about this when he first interviewed with me five years ago that he would have an opportunity like this. He sent me a really nice text the other day about feeling really prepared and confident.\u201d\n\n____\n\nDave Tippett, Edmonton.\n\nNHL coaching record: 553-413-120-28 (Dallas, 2002-09, Arizona, 2009-17)\n\nReplaces: McLellan, who was fired after four seasons.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a big structure guys with his systems and I think that\u2019s going to be big for us because I think in the past, when things start going bad for us, we kind of abandon our structure and then things get worse and worse,\u201d forward Ryan Nugent-Hopkins said. \u201cWhen things start to go wrong, I think Tipp\u2019s going to be able to keep us within that structure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAlain Vigneault, Philadelphia.\n\nNHL coaching record: 648-435-98-35 (Montreal, 1997-2000, Vancouver, 2006-2013, New York Rangers, 2013-2018)\n\nReplaces: interim coach Scott Gordon, who took over in December after Dave Hakstol was fired.\n\nWhat they\u2019re saying: \u201cIt was obviously a huge reason why I decided to go there,\u201d said trade acquisition forward Kevin Hayes, who played for Vigneault in New York. \u201cHe was a big contributor to my game changing in the NHL, from being kind of just offensive to a 200-foot player that I believe that I am today.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ralph Krueger doesn't care if you have never heard of him.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Wawrow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/maple_leafs_sabres_hockey_69357_c0-70-1696-1058_s1770x1032.jpg?72b4e4b65827174f380e1056ecc3b10dd18be0e2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
