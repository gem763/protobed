(Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Dave Roberts trusted Clayton Kershaw, and it cost the Los Angeles Dodgers their season.\n\nThe two-time defending National League champions saw their franchise record-setting 106-win season go poof Wednesday, when the three-time Cy Young winner turned in an eighth inning that will haunt him for years.\n\nFor much of the night, Dodgers operated in a steady comfort, a somewhat odd sensation given the make-or-break stakes of their National League Division Series Game 5 against the Washington Nationals. They enjoyed a jubilant start. Max Muncy strutted down the first base line as he watched a two-run homer carry into the right-centerfield seats in the first inning, and left fielder Kik\u00e9 Hernandez rocked his hips as he celebrated his solo shot in the second.\n\nThose early fireworks, combined with Walker Buehler\u2019s second outstanding outing of the series, had the Dodgers just two innings away from an NLDS-clinching victory and the champagne bath that came with it. But instead, the night ended with the Dodger Stadium crowd showering the field with loud boos and streaming for an early exit.\n\nThe Nationals capitalized on the Kershaw disaster and completed the stunning comeback with a Howie Kendrick 10th-inning grand slam for a 7-3 victory, earning a date with the St. Louis Cardinals by reaching the NL Championship Series for the first time since relocating to Washington in 2005.\n\nEven before Muncy\u2019s early bomb, the Dodgers hardly seemed consumed by thoughts of their impending doom. Roberts, the Dodgers\u2019 manager, told reporters that the clubhouse televisions weren\u2019t tuned to the Cardinals\u2019 13-1 defeat of the Atlanta Braves in the afternoon.\n\n\u201cI think they pivoted from the baseball game to gymnastics,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Simone Biles] was in action today, so I\u2019m not sure who they are watching. Maybe the flying squirrel?\u201d\n\nDuring more innocent times, third baseman Justin Turner took the podium pregame and shrugged off a question about the series\u2019 length.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to just win three in a row and not have to worry about this,\u201d Turner said.\n\nThere was nothing much to worry about for seven innings. Buehler was sensational just as he had been in Game 1, giving up just one earned run and striking out seven while throwing 117 pitches in 6 \u2154 innings. He worked his way out of early trouble in the fifth, and he conceded his only run on a Juan Soto single in the sixth.\n\nBut Kershaw\u2019s arrival changed all that. The 31-year-old starter had been slow to get going in a Game 2 loss, and the Nationals never gave him the chance to settle into what, theoretically, could have been a series-clinching relief appearance.\n\nAfter recording one out in the bottom of the seventh, Kershaw gave up back-to-back solo homers to Anthony Rendon and Soto to open the eighth. Rendon took him out to left. One pitch later, Soto rocked him out to right-center. And then Roberts immediately, mercifully, took him out of the game.\n\nRoberts said afterward that \u201cif the blame falls on me, I\u2019ve got no problem with it,\u201d adding that he had \u201cno problem wearing the brunt of the blame\u201d for what he called a \u201cvery, very disappointing\u201d season-ending loss.\n\n\u201c[Kershaw] is probably the best pitcher of our generation,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHe got us out of a big spot [in the seventh]. It just didn\u2019t work out. There\u2019s always going to be second-guessing when things don\u2019t work out, but I\u2019ll take my chances any day on Clayton.\u201d\n\nThe pitcher wore his disbelief at another postseason nightmare on the mound and in the dugout. After Soto\u2019s homer, Kershaw crouched down in agony before the ball had even left the park. Later, he sat alone and stared into the distance.\n\nIn a somber postgame clubhouse, the Dodgers grappled with the night\u2019s sharp turn and their season\u2019s abrupt finish.\n\n\u201cWinning 106 games and going home after one round, it sucks,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cFor us to be one and done, it\u2019s tough. I don\u2019t think anybody in this clubhouse expected us to be going home this soon.\u201d\n\nWhile it was Joe Kelly, and not Kershaw, who conceded Kendrick\u2019s decisive homer and took the Game 5 loss officially, there was little question when L.A.\u2019s season ended. It was those two consecutive pitches in the eighth inning that went sailing into the outfield stands, taking the Dodgers\u2019 calm and confidence with them.\n\n\u201cHaving a group of guys you spent your entire season with, eight straight months battling and competing,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cAnd it ends all of a sudden, and you\u2019re to blame for it. It\u2019s a terrible feeling.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nNationals storm back in Game 5 to finally break through to NLCS, set to play Cardinals\n\nHow Stephen Strasburg became virtually unhittable at the perfect time for the Nationals\n\nMax Scherzer is Max Scherzer again, and the Nationals\u2019 season lives because of it\n\nMax Scherzer explains the pressure athletes are under at all times", "description": "The three-time Cy Young winner turned in an eighth inning that will haunt him for years.", "authors": ["Ben Golliver", "Nba Reporter", "October At Am", "Ben Golliver Joined The Washington Post As The National Nba Writer In Previously", "He Was A Senior Writer At Sports Illustrated Covering The Nba.
