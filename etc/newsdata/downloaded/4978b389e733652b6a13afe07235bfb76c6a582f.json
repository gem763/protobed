That was the worst appearance by an executive branch official I\u2019ve ever seen in my career.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWhat\u2019s he hiding?\u2026 The witnesses all worked for that guy. What is he distancing himself from? Either he was the most incompetent and detached secretary of state in the nation\u2019s history, had no idea that everyone that worked at the State Department was hair on fire alarmed and concerned about the corruption being carried out by Rudy Giuliani or he was part of it.
