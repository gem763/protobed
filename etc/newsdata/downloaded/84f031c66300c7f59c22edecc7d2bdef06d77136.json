Lost production and other costs related to the United Auto Workers strike of more than 46,000 U.S. factory workers, which halted production for the final two weeks of the quarter, dented profits by $1 billion.\n\nThe auto maker's pretax earnings per share for the quarter was $1.72 versus the $1.31 average estimate of Wall Street analysts. Net income fell 8%, to $2.3 billion. Revenue slipped 1%, to $35.5 billion.\n\nWrite to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 08:20 ET (12:20 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
