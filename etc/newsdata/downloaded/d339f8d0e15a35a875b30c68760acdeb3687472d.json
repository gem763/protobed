The group said Boeing failed to adequately inform the FAA about changes to a flight control system that has been implicated in the accidents.\n\n\u201cThe board has full confidence in Dennis as CEO and believes this division of labour will enable maximum focus on running the business with the board playing an active oversight role,\u201d Calhoun said in a Boeing statement.\n\nMuilenburg said in a statement that he supported splitting the CEO and chairman jobs.\n\nThe board had in April opposed a shareholder resolution to split the jobs amid criticism over Boeing\u2019s response to the accidents. The measure was rejected by a 2-to-1 margin.\n\nThe Max was Boeing\u2019s best-selling plane until being grounded worldwide in March after the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The company has set aside billions to compensate airlines affected.\n\nThe US justice department and Congress are investigating the company, which also faces many lawsuits from families of passengers who died.\n\nFurther safety issue found in grounded Boeing 737 Max planes Read more\n\nMuilenburg is scheduled to testify on 30 October before a House committee looking into the plane\u2019s certification.\n\nBoeing was initially optimistic that the Max could return to flight months ago but work to fix flight software took longer than expected. In June FAA test pilots discovered another problem in the plane\u2019s computers, extending the grounding.\n\nMuilenburg said recently that Boeing expected the plane to be back in service by early in the fourth quarter, but the company still hasn\u2019t formally submitted its fixes to regulators. US airlines don\u2019t expect the plane back until at least January and it could be longer in other countries.", "description": "Board reshuffle follows report saying planemaker failed to fully inform FAA about changes to flight control system", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e60fbac37476503ad9701d7613530714b8ef20b4/0_66_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7787ddaed4999d7293633492716e91d7", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
