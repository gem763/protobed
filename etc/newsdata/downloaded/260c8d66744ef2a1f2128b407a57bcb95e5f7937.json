Yeah, it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me at first either. If I\u2019ve got to do the grinding by hand, what\u2019s the point of the vibration? In a word, the answer is: fluffy. As in, this grinder made my cannabis fluffy and I\u2019m sent.\n\nWhen I recently reviewed the Atomic9 dry-herb vaporizer from Cloudious9, I also had the opportunity to check out the Tectonic9 herb grinder. It costs the same as the vape, which is why I think it\u2019s important to explain why I really, really like this grinder.\n\nCredit: Nicole Gray\n\nThe vibration feature works in tandem with a flip-up spout and sliding door mechanism that allows you to go from grinding (by hand) to dispensing (via vibration). If you\u2019re not familiar with how grinders work or what they\u2019re for, they aren\u2019t all that complicated. Essentially they\u2019re a little bowl with a lid that, like an iron maiden, have spikes or teeth secured to the inside. You place your cannabis flower inside and then you \u201cgrind\u201d it up by twisting the top and bottom.\n\nThis makes it easier to smoke or vaporize. Just like you wouldn\u2019t put a whole onion on your hamburger, it makes sense to chop up your herb for consumption.\n\nWhat\u2019s weird here is that I\u2019ve never used a grinder with a \u201cdispenser,\u201d typically you just take the top off and pour out what you\u2019ve ground. I\u2019ll admit that I didn\u2019t get it at first. It\u2019s actually way less convenient to use the little hole in the side of the grinder and the flip-up spout to pour out tiny bits of herb than it is to just dump it.\n\nCredit: Nicole Gray\n\nBut, according to Cloudious9\u2019s website the vibration function is \u201coptimized at the perfect vibrational frequency for even dispensing and fluffy materials.\u201d This is truth in advertising. It takes about a minute to a minute-and-a-half to shake out a full chamber\u2019s worth of herb, because you\u2019ve got to shake it and tap it and generally fidget to make the herb pour out. But what comes out is incredibly fluffy.\n\nAs I said it\u2019s less convenient, but it\u2019s worth the extra effort. The fluffier your herb is, in my experience, the better it vapes and the more evenly it smokes. In this respect, there\u2019s nothing out there like the Tectonic9. If you\u2019re a habitual user, this should stretch your herb without affecting your usage. And if you\u2019re breaking out the top shelf cannabis, you\u2019ll want it as fluffy and flavorful as possible. The vibrations work.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be clear, even if it didn\u2019t vibrate this is a top-notch grinder. The diamond-shaped teeth are sharp and perfectly positioned to swirl up a fluffy grind on their own. This is better than the crap you pay nearly as much for in most head shops.\n\nI have only one complaint about the Tectonic9, but it\u2019s a significant one. There\u2019s no secondary screen to collect kief \u2013 powderized cannabis shaken off by the grinding process. This is a shame because I assume the vibrations increase the amount of kief created, alas it gets mixed back in with the ground flower.\n\nAside from that one let down, this thing\u2019s the bees\u2019 knees. I\u2019ve used a lot of grinders, but none of them were USB-powered gadgets with a vibrating spout.\n\nYou can pick one up on Amazon for $59.99.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
