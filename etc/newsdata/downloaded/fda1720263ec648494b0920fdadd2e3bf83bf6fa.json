But concentrations have increased by 5.5% in the last two years, and premature deaths associated with exposure to the dangerous particles spiked by 9,700 last year.\n\nThose deaths represent $89 billion in potential damages, according to a working paper published Monday in the National Bureau of Economic Research by two Carnegie Mellon University economists.\n\nWhile the potential links with early deaths and financial damages are alarming, there are other effects of declining air quality that are more difficult to quantify but are negatively impacting people's lives, the authors say.\n\n\"I think the thing that people often overlook and that we don't have great data on is the kid down the block who has asthma, and whose asthma is getting worse. The person who has emphysema for whom breathing is even harder,\" said Carnegie Mellon professor Karen Clay, who co-authored the paper. \"Those peoples' lives are being made worse as well.\"\n\nRead More", "description": "After improving for years, a new working paper finds that air quality in the US is on the decline again and could be linked with almost 10,000 premature deaths in 2018.", "authors": ["Drew Kann"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191023111634-us-air-pollution-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
