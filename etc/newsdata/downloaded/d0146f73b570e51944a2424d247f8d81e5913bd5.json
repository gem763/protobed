Frazier was one of several September call-ups who joined New York ahead of its game against the Oakland A\u2019s, and the 24-year-old outfielder seems to have retained at least some of the characteristic flair that initially made him a fan favorite but then rubbed some in New York the wrong way.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cI\u2019m contemplating getting this one pierced, too,\u201d Frazier said, pointing to the other side of his nose. \u201cLike Lenny Kravitz, so having a hoop over here.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the Yankees have a rule \u2014 written or otherwise \u2014 against piercings in the same way they police facial hair and flowing locks like the sort Frazier sported before he joined the team and was judged to be a follicular distraction.\n\nIn that sense, at least, Frazier is playing by the rules. His hair remains short \u2014 shaved on the sides, some curls arranged cleanly on top \u2014 and he insisted on shaving his face before he spoke to media pregame Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a long dream is what it feels like,\u201d he said of his return to Yankee Stadium.\n\nIn 53 games with the big league club, Frazier slashed .283/.330/.513 with 11 home runs to help push the almost preternaturally injury-depleted Yankees atop the standings. But he made a number of dramatic defensive miscues, and advanced metrics ranked him among the worst outfielders in baseball \u2014 Mike Tauchman, who became a lineup staple in the wake of Frazier\u2019s demotion, ranks among the best.\n\nStory continues\n\nA little over a week after Frazier incited a multi-day news cycle by ducking the media following one such poor defensive performance, he was sent down to the minors to make room for Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n and the returning Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge.\n\nClint Frazier returned to the New York Yankees on Sunday. (AP)\n\nHe called it a \u201ctough pill to swallow,\u201d but later told the New York Times, \u201cI can\u2019t be mad about my situation. Ultimately, I put myself here.\u201d\n\nAnd he stayed there through the trade deadline and even up through the Yankees setting a new record for players on the injured list, slugging just .433 with eight homers over 61 games with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until rosters expanded for September that Frazier was given a second chance to prove he can contribute at the major league level this year.\n\n\u201cI went down there and obviously had to focus on some things to make it back here,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely think I made some good plays while I was down there and ready to see how it translates up here.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t given the chance to demonstrate how much his defense had improved Sunday, but he was in the lineup. Yankees manager Aaron Boone slotted Frazier at DH to get a right-handed bat in the bottom of the order against Oakland lefty Sean Manaea, and he hit two hard outs and drew a walk, receiving an enthusiastic round of applause before his first at-bat. Ultimately, he was just the guy who was pulled in the bottom of the ninth so Mike Ford could hit a walk-off, pinch-hit home run in the Yankees\u2019 5-4 victory.\n\nFor much of the summer, the Yankees had the luxury of not needing the flashy first-rounder to pull away from the pack. And if you were Clint Frazier, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking they didn\u2019t want him either. But they failed to flip him for pitching depth at the deadline and there\u2019s only so long you can let a 120 OPS+ languish in the minors \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly as long as the rosters are capped at 25 men.\n\nFrazier is back in the lineup Monday \u2014 and in left field \u2014 as the Yankees face Texas lefty Mike Minor. And if they let him, he\u2019ll undoubtedly contribute at the plate as the Yankees look to clinch the AL East. It remains to be seen if he\u2019s honed his defense as he claims \u2014 and whether both sides can bring out the best in each other.\n\nFor his part, Frazier is trying to say all the right things. \u201cObviously I\u2019m lucky enough to come back, help a really good team be a little bit better,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cTrying to do my part; whatever that is, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nIf he makes good on that, the Yankees would be wise to let the nose ring stuff slide.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "For much of the summer, the Yankees had the luxury of not needing the flashy first-rounder to pull away from the pack.
