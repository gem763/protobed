In just a few weeks, many of them will be hundreds, even thousands of kilometres away from their native Bulgaria seeking out the better opportunities, jobs and incomes awaiting them abroad.\n\nAs natives of the poorest member of the European Union, Bulgarians have been leaving their home in droves, contributing to the world\u2019s fastest population decline. Bulgaria\u2019s population was around 9 million at the end of the 1980s, but it fell to fewer than 7 million in 2018, and is expected to fall below 6 million in 50 years. The UN Population Division projects that Bulgaria will lose 23% of its population by 2050 \u2013 a projection so high that the country is neck-and-neck with Lithuania for the fastest shrinking population in the world.\n\nLow birth rates are the biggest factor for such steep decline. But what sets Bulgaria apart from other declining European countries is its massive outbound migration.\n\nThe government does not keep reliable statistics but some economists, including Cvetan Davidkov, estimate that at least 60,000 Bulgarians leave each year. And even that estimate may be low, given that Germany alone says it welcomed 30,000 new Bulgarian residents in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe [population] prognosis isn\u2019t optimistic, and that is a big problem for us,\u201d says Davidkov, a professor at the faculty of economics at Sofia University. The brain drain, he says, affects all sectors of the economy as the majority of Bulgarians \u2013 from doctors to construction workers \u2013 believe that better opportunities await abroad.", "description": "As Bulgaria\u2019s steep population decline threatens the country, some natives are trying to give those who\u2019ve left a reason to come back home.", "authors": ["Denise Hruby"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7n/89/p07n89dn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
