Jim McGovern (D-Mass.), the chairman of the House Rules Committee, said Monday that he will introduce a resolution this week to \"ensure transparency\" and \"provide a clear path forward\" in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe text of the resolution has yet to be released, but McGovern plans to introduce it Tuesday ahead of a markup in his committee Wednesday. A senior Democratic aide said that the resolution is expected to hit the House floor on Thursday.\n\nIt would be the first formal vote on the new impeachment process by the House since Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) threw her support behind an inquiry in September.\n\nDemocrats have insisted they did not need to hold a floor vote to launch the impeachment inquiry itself, despite calls for such a vote from the White House and Republicans.\n\nPelosi explained the move in a letter to House Democrats that suggested it would give the caucus new leverage with the administration.\n\n\"We are taking this step to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives,\" Pelosi wrote in the letter.\n\nThe resolution will not launch the investigation, as Democrats continue to say there is no reason to hold such a vote.\n\nInstead, it is expected to affirm the ongoing investigation and establish procedures for public hearings, authorize the release of witness deposition transcripts and outline the process for transferring evidence to the House Judiciary Committee, which would be tasked with drafting and approving articles of impeachment.\n\nAs a result, it could be an easier vote for centrist lawmakers who do not want to take a formal vote on launching an impeachment investigation. Pelosi has steadily sought to protect such members.\n\nAll the same, it could also be used by Democrats to push back at GOP arguments over the process of impeachment.\n\n\"As committees continue to gather evidence and prepare to present their findings, I will be introducing a resolution to ensure transparency and provide a clear path forward,\" McGovern said in a statement. \"This is the right thing to do for the institution and the American people.\"\n\nAn official working on the impeachment inquiry said that the resolution will establish procedures for open hearings to be conducted by the House Intelligence Committee, with questioning led by both staff and members.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis has proved a format conducive to fact-finding during the depositions,\u201d the official said.\n\nRepublicans have blasted Democrats over the process, something that hit a peak last week when dozens of GOP lawmakers stormed the secure facility to protest the lack of more widespread access for all members of the House.\n\nOnly members of the three House committees leading the impeachment inquiry \u2014 Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs \u2014 are allowed to sit in on the witness interviews in a secure facility in the sub-basement of the Capitol. Members of both parties are allowed to attend and ask questions of witnesses.\n\nEarlier this month, the White House said that it would not comply with the impeachment inquiry because the House had not taken a formal vote to establish it as it did with the impeachments of former Presidents Nixon and Clinton.\n\nAdoption of the resolution is unlikely to prevent Republicans from attacking the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"House Democrats now suddenly saying they'll vote on an impeachment resolution to 'ensure transparency' is rich\u2014considering they've spent weeks conducting interviews in secret, leaking their own talking points while locking down any and all information that benefits the President,\" tweeted Rep.

There is no requirement under the Constitution, under House Rules, or House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\" Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy Kevin Owen McCarthy'Veterans for impeachment' signs seen at World Series game during Trump visit Trump met with boos, 'lock him up' chant at Game 5 of World Series Overnight Defense: Top general briefs GOP senators on Syria plan | Senators 'encouraged' by briefing | Pence huddles with Republican allies on Syria | Trump nominee sidesteps questions on arms treaties MORE (R-Calif.) on Oct. 3.\n\nThe vote would come as House Democrats have already had success in the courts and with obtaining witness interviews under subpoena.
