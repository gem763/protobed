Mr. Tolson and Mr. Garrah declined to be taken to a hospital for their injuries.\n\nThe driver of the car \u2014 a Nissan Versa \u2014 was identified as Ryan McClain, 29, of the District, and his passenger as Eric Diprospero, 31, of Baltimore. Mr. McClain and Mr. Diprospero were transported to a hospital for treatment of their minor injuries, authorities said.\n\nState police said Mr. Tolson\u2019s propeller-driven aircraft \u2014 a Mooney M20J \u2014 appears to have crashed as it was attempting to take off from Freeway Airport in Bowie.\n\nLow-flying planes are a common sight along that stretch of U.S. Route 50.\n\nThe end of the airport\u2019s runway is several yards from the eastbound lanes of the highway, a key thoroughfare between the nation\u2019s capital and Maryland\u2019s capital city.\n\nEastbound and westbound traffic on Route 50 was halted for several hours, as officials treated the injured, cleared the debris and investigated the crash. Long backups ensued: The highway\u2019s nearest off-ramps are located miles from site of the crash.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said it will continue the investigation and the National Transportation Safety Board will determine the probable cause of the crash.\n\nAccording to preliminary data from the FAA, Mooney aircraft have been involved in 11 incidents or crashes this year.\n\nFive were fatal crashes, two of which were the same model as the plane that crashed Thursday in Bowie.\n\nSince 1983, there have been 26 incidents at Freeway Airport, according to FAA data.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
