Drake has been the subject of multiple trade rumors throughout the season.\n\nDrake has had a lackluster 2019 campaign after accounting for over 1,000 yards from scrimmage and nine total touchdowns last season. The fourth-year tailback has failed to cross the 50-yard mark on the ground in a game this season and has been unable to break out as a receiving threat out of the backfield.\n\nThrough six games (two starts) this season, Drake has 174 rushing yards on 47 carries and 22 receptions for 174 receiving yards. He has failed to record a touchdown this year and has two fumbles.\n\nThe winless Dolphins will play the Steelers on Monday night before hosting the New York Jets next week.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 The Miami Dolphins will be without running back Kenyan Drake for Monday night\u2019s matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
