And I can do whatever I want to it. I can push it. Study it. Tweak it. Listen to it. Everybody wants to know what I\u2019m on. What am I on?! I\u2019m on my bike, busting my ass, six hours a day. What are YOU on?\u201d The full voiceover, there, from an inspirational Nike commercial from 2001, featuring the cyclist Lance Armstrong.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t get the message with that one, Armstrong filmed another Nike ad a few years later to really push it home. \u201cThe critics say I\u2019m arrogant, a doper, washed up, a fraud, that I couldn\u2019t let it go,\u201d this one brooded. \u201cThey can say whatever they want. I\u2019m not back on my bike for them.\u201d\n\nUK Athletics chief Neil Black leaves in wake of Alberto Salazar doping ban Read more\n\nIf you\u2019re catching up with this millennium on tape delay, my apologies for the spoilers that follow. But Armstrong, that shining beacon of purity, was finally, finally dropped by Nike in 2012, accused of having \u201cmisled Nike\u201d. This is really as close to athletic treason as you can get, and for a firm headquartered in a US state where capital punishment is still legal, I\u2019m amazed it somehow doesn\u2019t carry the death penalty yet.\n\nIn order that they might save face for having been misled for so long, it was commercially vital for Nike to push the line that Armstrong was the most fantastically clever cheat in human history. He was basically the unbroken world record holder in cheating. Because the alternative is that something that was always too good to be true, in a sport we already knew was completely bent, turned out to be what many wise observers had been saying all along. Of course, \u201cwe are selectively gullible\u201d isn\u2019t really the Nike brand.\n\nAnd yet, at some point in the future \u2013 like 100 years from now or something \u2013 perhaps it will be seen as such. Back in the short term, I wonder if any corporate censure will even await Alberto Salazar, who has been banned for four years for doping violations, but who is still being supported by Nike in his legal appeals against the ruling. The critically misunderstood running mastermind behind the Nike Oregon Project, Salazar has the Nike swoosh tattooed on his shoulder (like a second-tier member of the Staines massive). So he will presumably be glad to note that a de-swooshing ceremony remains in the long grass.\n\nThese are the sorts of questions Sebastian Coe should be asking. Unfortunately, he was a Nike ambassador for 38 years\n\nAs Nike insisted in a statement to the BBC a few days ago, the decision on Salazar \u201chad nothing to do with administering banned substances to any Oregon Project athlete\u201d. Taking gold in hair-splitting, the firm added: \u201cAs the panel noted, they were struck by the amount of care Alberto took to ensure he was complying with the World Anti-Doping Code.\u201d Guys, they were mainly struck by the need to ban him for four years for doping violations \u2013 but go on. \u201cWe support Alberto in his decision to appeal and wish him the full measure of due process that the rules require.\u201d Nike\u2019s CEO sent a global email explaining that Usada \u201cupheld three charges against Alberto, all of which were committed without an intent or effect to dope or cheat\u201d.\n\nYup, listen up, employees. Any athletes considering speaking up now should certainly consider how clear the CEO has made his feelings. As the whistleblower Kara Goucher puts it: \u201cHe [Parker] should be apologising to all the athletes signed by Nike who were funnelled into that programme. He should be cutting ties and instead he\u2019s doubling down and supporting him [Salazar]. Other athletes can\u2019t speak out and say how they really feel because the CEO of the company they represent is saying \u2018we support Alberto\u2019. It\u2019s a horrible toxic environment.\u201d\n\nIndeed \u2013 and yet it\u2019s one that basically seems to run world athletics. Seemingly half the pundits are sponsored by Nike or work for the sportswear giant, which runs its own secretive training programmes, pushing the association beyond mere conflicts of interest toward the sense that a vast percentage of the sport has basically been bought and paid by the firm in one way or another. Should any commercial company really be so powerful in sports? At what point would a governing body who understood the existential threat to athletics\u2019 credibility start thinking about antitrust issues? How can any one firm wield so much influence, then claim to be little more than ingenues when agents of that influence are found to be cheats? These are the sorts of questions Sebastian Coe should be asking. Unfortunately, he was a Nike ambassador for 38 years, and only relinquished his role with regret, when it was pointed out that being IAAF president was a conflict of interest. He insisted it was just \u201cnoise\u201d.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nThus Nike is permitted to continue presenting itself as at once the most cynical and the most naive company in the entire world of sport. How else to explain the fact they seem to have bought Salazar\u2019s claim that he was using his son as a lab rat to work just how much testosterone you\u2019d need smeared on you to test positive? That the Usada panel accepted this is what you might call intriguing; that Nike did so is even more of an eyebrow-raiser.\n\nStill, Nike specialise in adverts that produce all the chills, with their Colin Kaepernick ad \u2013 which told you not to listen to \u201cnon-believers\u201d \u2013 last month winning the Emmy for outstanding commercial. So who knows, maybe they\u2019ll find some way to enfold even this latest scandal in a spine-tingler that sells more shoes. There is a point, not very far away, where \u201cnon-believers\u201d will destroy athletics. But sportswear? Sportswear will be just fine.", "description": "How can any one firm wield so much influence, then claim to be little more than ingenues when agents of that influence are found to be cheats?", "authors": ["Marina Hyde"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b3b211035b826d6e6f8f12a719f1cad2633e408/0_198_4152_2491/master/4152.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4217d3c477f0bd7e4a00f0ec8928c30e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
