(Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Justice Department reportedly shifted its review of the Russia probe to a criminal investigation, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday, a move that is likely to raise concerns Trump and his allies may be using government powers to go after their political opponents.\n\nThe revelation comes as Trump is already facing scrutiny about a potential abuse of power, including a House impeachment inquiry examining whether he withheld military aid in order to pressure the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation of former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThe person who confirmed the criminal investigation was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIt is not clear what potential crimes are being investigated, but the designation as a formal criminal investigation gives prosecutors the ability to issue subpoenas, potentially empanel a grand jury and compel witnesses to give testimony and bring federal criminal charges.\n\nThe Justice Department had previously considered it to be an administrative review, and Attorney General William Barr appointed John Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut, to lead the inquiry into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. It's not clear when Durham's inquiry shifted to a criminal investigation.\n\nThe chairmen of the House judiciary and intelligence committees, which are leading the impeachment inquiry, said in a statement late Thursday the reports \"raise profound new concerns\" that Barr's DOJ \"has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump's political revenge.\"\n\nThe Justice Department is led by Attorney General William Barr, who appointed John Durham to lead the inquiry into the origins of Mueller's probe. (Aaron Bernstein/Reuters)\n\n\"If the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage,\" Democratic Representatives Jerrold Nadler and Adam Schiff said.\n\nThe New York Times first reported that Durham's inquiry had become a criminal investigation.", "description": "A U.S. judge on Friday granted a request by a House of Representatives committee for access to information that was blacked out of former special counsel Robert Mueller's report on his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5334856.1571987395!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-trump-russia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
