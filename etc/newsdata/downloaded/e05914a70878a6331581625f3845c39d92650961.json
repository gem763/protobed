Around 10% of these cases are caused by highly resistant strains with ESBLs, he said.\n\nThese bacteria often normally live in the intestines of healthy people and animals and while most varieties are harmless, some strains can cause food poisoning, urinary tract infections and, in worst case scenario, bloodstream infections.\n\nTo find out how these superbugs are spread, the researchers sequenced the genomes of ESBL-producing E.coli from humans, extracted from human bloodstream infections, human faeces and human sewerage, as well as meat, taken from beef, pork and chicken.\n\nThey found that ESBL-E.coli strains extracted from the human samples were similar to one another but differed to the strains present in animals.\n\nThis meant there was little crossover of ESBL-E.coli from animals to humans, the researchers said.\n\nBut, they added, it is important to follow good hygiene practices while cooking food as \u2018there are plenty of important food-poisoning bacteria, including other strains of E.coli\u2019 that can be picked up through food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProf Livermore added: \u2018Here \u2013 in the case of ESBL-E.coli \u2013 it\u2019s much more important to wash your hands after going to the toilet.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s important to wash your hands (Getty Images)\n\nCommenting on the research, professor Neil Woodford, of Public Health England, said: \u2018In order to tackle antibiotic resistance, we not only need to drive down inappropriate prescribing, but reduce infections in the first place.\n\n\u2018In order to limit serious, antibiotic resistant E.coli bloodstream infections, we must focus on thorough hand washing and good infection control, as well as the effective management of urinary tract infections.\n\n\u2018Prudent use of antibiotics is essential in both animals and humans. Antibiotics are a finite resource. We need them to continue to work when we get sick.\u2019", "description": "Always wash your hands", "authors": ["Metro Science Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_91223498_1571830033.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
