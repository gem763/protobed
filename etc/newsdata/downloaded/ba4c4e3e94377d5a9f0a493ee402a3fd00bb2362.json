My Concerns for her immediate safety were met.\u201d\n\nChildline sent him a transcript of the conversation with Jesse which he also forwarded to a mental health worker whom Jesse had been seeing.\n\nWhen the teenager found out Childline had shared her details with police, she was devastated, the inquest heard.\n\nHer mum Heather told the hearing: \u201cJess was so angry that her confidence had been breached and the police had been around.\n\n\u201cShe said she felt betrayed by Childline. She said she was tired and went back to sleep. She did not go to college that morning.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nJesse stayed home and watched TV but seemed fine. In the evening, she was pottering around her room while Heather went out with a friend.\n\nWhen Heather returned later in the evening, Jesse\u2019s stepdad, Simon, said the teenager was still up in the room.\n\nHeather went up to give her some chocolates to cheer her up \u2013 and found the schoolgirl hanging.\n\nSimon cut the teen down and her distraught mum tried desperately to save the girl with heart massage and the kiss of life, the inquest heard.\n\nParamedics also made desperate attempts to revive her but she never regained consciousness and died later the same evening on January 23 this year.\n\nThe inquest heard Jesse had passed all her GCSEs but had a history of self-harming and became stressed while study for A Levels at Scarborough Sixth Form College.\n\nHeather told the hearing that no one had told her daughter was suicide risk and the \"beautiful soul\" had been a casualty of a \u201ccatalogue of errors\u201d by those supposed to be supporting her.\n\nCoroner Jonathan Heath recorded a narrative verdict that Jesse had been found dead by her mum after leaving suicide notes.\n\nBut he did not make any recommendations after hearing that the mental health organisations involved had learned lessons from the tragedy.\n\nThey had met Childline, who had only spoken to the police about their concerns for Jesse, and it had been agreed that the agencies needed to work closer together in the future.\n\nChildline, originally inspired by an idea by That\u2019s Life presenter Esther Rantzen, has been run by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children since 2005.\n\nAn NSPCC spokesman said: \u201cThis is terribly sad and our thoughts are with Jesse\u2019s family. However, we cannot comment on individual cases.\u201d\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
