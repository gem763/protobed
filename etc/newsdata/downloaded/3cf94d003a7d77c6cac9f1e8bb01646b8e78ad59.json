Let\u2019s face it, you\u2019re probably not going to be using iMessage on an Android phone anytime soon. But sometimes, you can get around these limitations. If you recently acquired an Apple Watch but would like to use it with the Fitbit app, there is a way you can do that, even though the two companies\u2019 ecosystems don\u2019t acknowledge either other\u2019s existence. It\u2019s inconvenient and complicated, but it does work.\n\nIn this case, the Strava app acts as a friendly intermediary. Everybody talks to Strava and Strava returns the favor. So if you want to get your Apple data into Fitbit, it needs to run through Strava. Here\u2019s how to proceed.\n\nFirst, you have to install Strava. If you\u2019re already using Strava, or you\u2019ve read our article on how to sync popular fitness apps to your Apple watch, you can skip down to the next section.\n\nDownload the Strava app.\n\nCreate a Strava account. The app will immediately invite you to start recording your activity, but instead of rushing off to record, tap \u201cLater\u201d so you can set the app up. Here, you\u2019ll be offered the opportunity to follow athletes, connect your Facebook account, and sync your contacts. You can also just skip the whole thing.\n\nNext, you\u2019ll see the \u201cGetting Started\u201d screen, where you\u2019ll connect your Apple Watch.\n\nTap \u201cConnect a GPS watch or computer\u201d and you\u2019ll see a long list of supported devices. Tap \u201cApple Watch.\u201d\n\nGet past an interstitial page, agree to a code of conduct, and allow access to health-related data. Tap \u201cFinish.\u201d\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you can set up your Fitbit app so it will connect to your Apple Watch through Strava.\n\nLog into your Fitbit app. Tap the \u201cAccount\u201d target at the app\u2019s upper left corner. Scroll down to the Discover section and tap on \u201cCompatible Apps.\u201d\n\nScroll to Strava and tap it.\n\nTap on the \u201cDownload\u201d button (even though you\u2019ve already set up Strava). The App Store will open to the Strava download page; tap \u201cOpen,\u201d since you\u2019ve already installed it.\n\nTap Fitbit from the list of devices that appears. (Note that the Apple Watch doesn\u2019t appear on the list.) Then tap \u201cConnect Fitbit.\u201d Enter your Fitbit account information.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrava is now a conduit between your Apple Watch and Fitbit, and data should be flowing in both directions.", "description": "If you recently acquired an Apple Watch but would like to use it with the Fitbit app, there is a way you can do that, even though the two companies\u2019 ecosystems don\u2019t acknowledge either other\u2019s existence.
