It was quite the scene \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in all my years covering Congress. The sergeant at arms even had to be called in at one point to defuse the situation and perform a security sweep because Republicans were violating the strict no cell phone use rules.\n\nJosh Gerstein, legal affairs contributor: Probably what I got to witness first-hand, which was a defense lawyer for one of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas, tell a federal judge that some of the evidence the government has collected in the straw-donor and foreign-donations case may not be usable because Parnas and Giuliani were working for the president of the United States. Giuliani hasn\u2019t been charged, of course, but when he was the swashbuckling top federal prosecutor in New York in the 1980s could anyone have predicted that his activities would be intimately connected to a case being prosecuted by that same office?\n\nWhich criminal probe are you watching closest?\n\nNahal : I\u2019ve been fascinated by Rudy Giuliani for many years, so I\u2019m eyeing with interest the various criminal probes into his actions. I\u2019m not an expert on the Bard, but there has to be a Shakespeare play that captures the arc of Giuliani\u2019s life and career. He will probably say it\u2019s \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing.\u201d\n\nNatasha: The Giuliani investigation just got a lot more interesting, in light of new reporting from our colleague Darren Samuelsohn about the Justice Department\u2019s Criminal Division jumping into the fray. The other one to watch, of course, is the continuing probe out of the Southern District of New York into Giuliani\u2019s two associates, Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were indicted on campaign finance charges earlier this month. Both men have pleaded not guilty.\n\nMelanie: We now know the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation \u2014 into itself. DOJ has transitioned from an administrative review into the origins of its Russia probe \u2014 which Trump has repeatedly decried as a \"hoax\" despite mounds of evidence to the contrary \u2014 to a criminal inquiry with subpoena and grand jury power. The news raised eyebrows in D.C., with some Democrats worried that the the department is acting like Trump\u2019s political attack dog instead of an independent law enforcement agency.\n\nJosh: Like other Justice Department reporters, I\u2019m fascinated by this new criminal investigation and what the grounds \u2014 or the predicate as they call it here \u2014 for launching it. No one seems to have nailed that down yet. Some possibilities: the inspector general investigation stumbled across evidence that someone was illegally leaking to the press about the Trump-Russia probe; the IG thinks someone lied to them, to Congress or to the courts; or someone may have been conducting some surveillance or other investigate tactic that may have been illegal. I guess it\u2019s remotely possible that the alleged crime has to do with the decision to launch the Trump-Russia inquiry in the first place or anti-Trump bias on the part of officials involved, but it\u2019s hard to see how that itself can be torqued into a criminal case.\n\nHow do you think the 2nd Circuit will respond to Trump's argument that he could shoot someone on 5th Ave?\n\nNahal: I believe it will say that at the very least such an action would open the president to being investigated. I\u2019m not sure about prosecuted, at least not while he\u2019s in office.\n\nMelanie: That was a shocking argument to many observers \u2014 and likely to the judges as well. Essentially, Trump\u2019s lawyers are saying the president is above the law (although they did acknowledge that Trump could be criminally prosecuted once he leaves office).\n\nJosh: It\u2019s a headline-grabber to be sure, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a question that the court has to answer directly in order to address the issue before them about turning over Trump\u2019s tax returns to the Manhattan D.A. A real weak point in the Trump legal team\u2019s argument is that they seem to be contending Trump has the right to keep any evidence about him away from investigators even if they want to use it to charge others. Even if a president does have some immunity, does that extend to all of his family members and business associates? I can\u2019t see any court adopting that stance.\n\nWhat do you think of the Republican hearing crashing strategy we saw this week?\n\nNahal: As a strategy it actually seemed pretty smart to me. At this stage, they have very little they can say on the substance of the impeachment inquiry\u2019s findings. So they want to muddy the picture the public has of the process but claiming, often misleadingly, that it is unfair. They managed to do that, as well as changing the headlines for a few hours. They also showed the GOP base that they remain loyal to Trump.\n\nNatasha: A stunt more than a strategy, and transparently so given how many Republicans currently have access to the closed-door depositions by virtue of their membership on the relevant committees \u2014 including ones who participated in the crash of the SCIF on Wednesday.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3f/4f/24e8a67e4c72a3d676a2b7e96772/191025-scalise-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
