That meant the company could raise about $355 million by selling 500 million primary shares at HK5.55 apiece.\n\nBacked by Chinese private-equity firm CDH Investments, JS Global, however, could not secure enough solid orders and had to cancel the IPO, sources said.\n\n\"The company has been trying to sell a story about U.S.-China synergy, but several investors are concerned that trade tensions would weigh on its business prospects in both countries,\" said one of the sources.\n\nJS Global did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
