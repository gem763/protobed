The first is the issue of consent and democracy, ensuring that any long-term arrangement that applies to Northern Ireland has the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. The second is the whole issue of customs, ensuring that there is no customs border between North and South.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would hope that what\u2019s happened today would be sufficient to allow negotiations to resume in Brussels.\u201d\n\nAsked how quickly agreement could be reached, Mr Varadkar said: \u201cI think all sides would like there to be an agreement next week at the council if possible, and there is obviously a further deadline after that, which is 31 October. So I would say a short pathway rather than a long one, but it\u2019s impossible to predict that for sure.\u201d\n\nFrance\u2019s Emmanuel Macron previously indicated that progress was needed before the end of this week to evaluate whether there was any prospect of agreement on a deal at the 17 October summit.\n\nAn agenda for the summit was expected to be released on Friday, though it could be held back if Brussels sees any indication of Johnson moving on elements of his plan which have proven unpalatable to the EU27.\n\nExpectations of a deal reached rock bottom on Wednesday, after an address to the European Parliament in which Mr Barnier said Johnson\u2019s plans were \u201cnot really in a position where we\u2019re able to find an agreement\u201d.\n\nBrussels objects that the UK proposal does not prevent a customs border in Ireland, does not provide immediately available or legally operable mechanisms and gives a veto to Stormont.", "description": "Irish premier Leo Varadkar has said that a treaty agreement on the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU is \u201cpossible\u201d by the end of October, amid reports of concessions from Boris Johnson ahead of next week\u2019s make-or-break Brussels summit.
