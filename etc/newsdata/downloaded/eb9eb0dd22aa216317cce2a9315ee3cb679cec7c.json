Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas saying he would support reparations for descendants of slaves, and other candidates acting as if the only issues of concern to African-Americans are racism and criminal justice reform.\n\nAs a black American who proudly served in the U.S. Army and graduated from college, I know that members of my community are hardworking and ambitious \u2013 just like Americans of other races and ethnicities. But the Democratic candidates seemed unable to see black Americans as anything other than perpetual victims who need to be rescued.\n\nNot surprisingly, the candidates vying to challenge President Trump in the 2020 election demonized him every chance they got. They ignored the fact that the president has signed into law the most comprehensive criminal justice reform bill in a generation \u2013 a long-sought goal in the black community.\n\nDOUG SCHOEN: AT THIRD DEM DEBATE, ONE BIG WINNER AND TWO SURPRISE LOSERS\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden tried to one-up the president on the issue of cutting the prison population. \"Nobody should be in jail for a non-violent crime,\" Biden said in a surprising line. \"When we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system.\"\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey pledged to create a White House office to battle white supremacy \u2013 yet another example of how the Democrats are wedded to the idea of making government bigger and bigger, raising taxes higher and higher, and spending more and more tax dollars as a way of solving every problem.\n\nIn contrast, President Trump understands the value of letting us all keep more of our own money to take care of our families and build better lives. He understands that the more money we\u2019re forced to turn over to Uncle Sam, the more dependent we all become on the government programs that the Democrats are always seeking to expand.\n\nBlack voters \u2013 like all voters \u2013 want and deserve independence, not dependence on government.\n\nOn the economic front, the Democratic would-be presidents ignored the record low unemployment rate black Americans are enjoying in America\u2019s booming economy, which is thriving thanks to the tax cuts and abolition of unneeded regulations by the Trump administration.\n\nThe strong, vibrant economy President Trump has created is good for all Americans \u2013 and is a dramatic contrast to the failed Big Government, high-tax policies the Democrats trotted out.\n\nBlack voters \u2013 like all voters \u2013 want and deserve independence, not dependence on government.\n\nAnd while history has proven beyond doubt that the socialist policies embraced by Sen. Bernie Sanders and some of the other far-left candidates (though they deny they are socialists) have proven to be an abysmal failure around the world, the Democrats nevertheless held firm to their almost religious faith that government \u2013 rather than individual initiative \u2013 can solve all our problems.\n\nRight off the bat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota made a strong impression as a centrist candidate who was not on the far-far left fringe of the Democratic Party that Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth (\u201cI have a plan\u201d) Warren occupy.\n\nDuring the health care portion of the debate, Kobuchar\u2019s \u201che wrote it, but I read it\u201d critique of Sanders and his pie-in-the-sky absurdly expensive \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d legislation was a masterful moment.\n\nKlobuchar spent most of the night drawing a strong distinction between her and the others on the stage and establishing herself as a serious alternative for voters who just aren\u2019t gelling with the radical left extremist wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Joaquin Castro wasn\u2019t afraid to hit below the belt, mounting a devastating critique of former Vice President Joe Biden. At one point, Castro asked Biden: \u201cAre you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?\u201d That was a clear shot at the 76-year-old Biden on the age issue.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Castro claimed he was \u201cfulfilling the legacy of Barack Obama\u201d more than Biden, embracing the nation\u2019s only black president, who remains popular with most black voters. Biden has staked his claim for black support on his close working relationship with Obama when he served as Obama\u2019s vice president for eight years.\n\nIt was disappointing that handouts and fear were all the Democrats could offer to black voters \u2013 and other voters as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHere\u2019s the question facing all voters in November 2020 \u2013 whoever the Democrats will nominate: Do we want a president who gives us the freedom to achieve the American Dream \u2013 as President Trump is doing so successfully \u2013 or do we want a bloated government bureaucracy to take a giant chunk of our paychecks and then \u201ctake care\u201d of us in a patronizing, inefficient and ineffective way.\n\nThankfully, the racist and discriminatory policies that held down black Americans for hundreds of years are long gone. We can \u2013 and are \u2013 succeeding under the policies spearheaded by President Trump, who despite false Democratic attacks is proving to be the leader best able to deliver for Americans of all colors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ROB SMITH", "description": "The 10 Democratic presidential contenders debating Thursday night made condescending efforts to win black votes, with former Rep.
