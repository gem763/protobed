But where the hell were these people when Hollywood literally sold its artistic soul to the Communist Chinese?\n\nI am baffled over this NBA uproar. You mean people really care about all the terrible human rights abuses committed by the ChiComs?\n\nBecause you could have fooled me.\n\nHey, hey \u2014 over here! Remember this? Breitbart News has been reporting on this going back at least seven years.\n\nOh, wait \u2014 eight years\u2026\n\nYou see, some of us figured out something was terribly wrong with Hollywood, terribly misguided, terribly illiberal, when 2012\u2032 s Red Dawn remake, which had already been shot, was forced to digitally scrub every reference to the Chinese as the bad guys. Instead of Red China successfully invading a chunk of America, which is at least somewhat plausible, digital magic told us the North Koreans had done it, which is absurd. Yes, the starving, tiny, hapless North Koreans beat the United States Marines.\n\nThis is just how anti-art Hollywood has become in its effort to suck up to a government currently engaging in human rights abuses on par with Hitler. Forget about China\u2019s past. Forget about Mao and Year Zero and 45 million deaths. As I write this, the Chinese government is using appalling violence to repress its own people, and not just the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nChina, like Cuba, is a massive prison, a giant concentration camp, and Hollywood does not care because Hollywood is, above all, insatiably greedy.\n\nIf Hollywood wants access to China\u2019s massive movie-going public, to thousands and thousands of movie screens, China forces Hollywood to toe the line, lick its boots, censor itself, and \u2014 worst of all \u2014 depict the Chinese government as heroic and noble, which is no different than depicting the Nazis as heroic and noble.\n\nAnd we are not just talking about the movies Hollywood wants to distribute in China.\n\nYou remember that Red Dawn remake I was just talking about? It never left the county. Red Dawn wasn\u2019t censored and twisted into something laughable because Hollywood wanted to distribute it in China. Even though there was no foreign distribution whatsoever; even though it was produced for American consumption only, it was still censored so it wouldn\u2019t offend the Chinese government.\n\nThis was a key moment for Hollywood, this was back in 2011 when the film industry was desperate to gain admission to all those Chinese screens, when the film industry was sniveling and groveling to its Chinese masters purely out of greed.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened\u2026\n\nThe Chinese government leveraged Hollywood\u2019s desperation to gain a frightening amount of control over all of Hollywood\u2019s content. The Red Chinese, these mass-murdering fiends, now have veto power over America\u2019s greatest art form.\n\nAnd it is not just the movies. Because of all this consolidation over the past thirty years, because big companies continue to get bigger and bigger as they gobble up other companies, the very same multi-nationals that own the movie business also own the television and news business.\n\nSo not only do the Chinese have control over the content of our movies, that control also extends to television and the news media. These massive, multinational companies don\u2019t allow their TV shows or news outlets to expose or criticize China\u2019s human rights abuses out of the fear China will retaliate against its film product.\n\nListen, you cannot even begin to count how this censorship damages our movies and television shows because most of that censorship is what we don\u2019t see, which is anything things that might offend China\u2019s merciless censors.\n\nDidn\u2019t you find it odd how the 30th anniversary of Tiananmen Square was almost completely ignored? Where was the big, Oscar bait movie? In a moral world, that would be in theaters right now.\n\nThose of you wondering why movies have become so bland and sexless should know that it\u2019s not just the Woketards removing all the sexy fun from the big and small screen, it is also a prudish Chinese government.\n\nUnlike the Woketards, though, China has actual leverage, financial leverage, which is all Hollywood cares about. If China wanted every movie to be as sexually provocative as Basic Instinct, that\u2019s what would happen.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just what we don\u2019t see. Again and again we have watched Hollywood openly smooch ChiCom ass.\n\nThe big, disaster epic 2012 portrayed the Chinese government as humanity\u2019s literal saviors.\n\nAlfonso Cuaron laid some love on the Chinese in Gravity by inventing a space station they do not have.\n\nSandra Bullock in Gravity (Warner Bros. Picture, 2013)\n\nWhile the book World War Z depicted the zombie plague as having begun at the hands of an incompetent and corrupt Chinese government, the movie moved the origin story to North Korea.\n\nTransformers 2 set much of its actions in the gleaming, modern, and pristine city of Shanghai \u2014 no squalor there!\n\nThe upcoming Top Gun: Maverick is so concerned with offending its Chinese masters, Tom Cruise\u2019s iconic flight jacket was stripped of its Japanese and Taiwanese flags.\n\nAnd on and on and on\u2026\n\nOh, and those of you who would like to see more homosexual character in movies\u2026? The problem is not stuffy, right-wing Christians \u2014 it\u2019s China.\n\nSo why does Hollywood get a pass for completely retooling its entire industry to appease the Chinese, for offenses that make the NBA\u2019s recent PR disaster look like a stubbed toe?\n\nWell, Hollywood is run by hardcore leftists and the NBA is a male institution.\n\nSilicon Valley is even worse than Hollywood. Google actively participates is China\u2019s information repression of its own people, and no one cares because Silicon Valley is also a left-wing institution.\n\nThe outrage at the NBA is not principled, it\u2019s just another left-wing attack against masculinity.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
