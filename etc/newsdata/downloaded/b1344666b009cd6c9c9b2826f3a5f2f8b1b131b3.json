He also calls for government investment in Health Equity Zones with an emphasis on communities that have been redlined and marginalized, in order to close the gap in health disparities.\n\nTuition\n\nButtigieg proposes a $25 billion increase in funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions that serve minorities. More broadly, the plan includes an increased investment of federal resources for Title I schools and gives low-income students free tuition.\n\nCriminal justice reform\n\nButtigieg also wants to see the number of incarcerated people in the U.S. at the federal and state levels drop by 50%. He calls for the elimination of incarceration for drug possession and would reduce sentences for other drug offenses. The plan indicates that the policy would be applied retroactively, meaning past sentences for drug offenses could be modified under the Douglass Plan. Buttigieg also proposes eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and abolishing private prisons at the federal level.\n\nHousing\n\nButtigieg is proposing the creation of a public trust fund to purchase abandoned houses. These properties would be made available to some residents in pilot cities, which the Department of Housing of Urban Development (HUD) would choose, based on a variety of factors, including available employment and the amount of land available. This would be done in conjunction with investments to revitalize the surrounding area.\n\nIn South Bend, Buttigieg, as mayor, implemented a housing initiative called 1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days. The initiative aimed to reduce the number of abandoned houses in the city by rehabilitating or destroying the properties. It received some criticism from South Bend residents who don't feel it improved their neighborhoods.\n\nThe plan would be a \"complement\" to HR 40, which is legislation pending in Congress that would create a commission to study and recommend proposals on paying reparations to the descendants of slaves.\n\nButtigieg has said on the campaign trail that leaders need to more intentional with their policies to replace anti-racist policies.\n\n\"I believe that when it comes to the experience of Black America, replacing racist policies with neutral policies won't get the job done,\" Buttigieg said at a fundraiser in Alexandria, Virginia in June. \"We can't have a country where people have been systematically denied every opportunity to build wealth, health, education, and then expect it to take care of itself, even we did have neutral policies, which in many cases, to this day we don't.\"\n\nButtigieg initially released the framework of the Douglass Plan in June at a Black Economic Alliance Forum in South Carolina. Details are being released as he struggles to gain support from African American voters. According to a Quinnipiac poll after the Democratic primary debates in Miami, Buttigieg polled at zero percent among African American voters.", "description": "South Bend, Indiana mayor and Democratic presidential candidate released a plan to help empower black Americans through anti-racist policies across a number of sectors", "authors": ["Jack Turman"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/07/11/1de40fad-242e-476c-aa6e-bbe45d251051/thumbnail/1200x630/14d242b5cf8ade87640a204756ca69b4/rts2ktt5.jpg"}
