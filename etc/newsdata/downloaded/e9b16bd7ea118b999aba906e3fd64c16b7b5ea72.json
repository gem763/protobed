A person familiar with the email confirmed it.\n\nMusk said that the company should end up with 110,000 orders for cars during the quarter, and that it is doing everything it can to get the vehicles delivered by Monday, the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"The challenge is making sure that we have the right car variants in the right locations and rallying as much as our company resources as possible to help with the end of the quarter deliveries,\" he said.\n\nReaching 100,000 sales would top the company's previous record of 95,200 cars it delivered in the second quarter of this year. It would be an impressive achievement nonetheless.", "description": "Tesla has a shot at selling 100,000 cars this quarter, a first for the company, according to an email that CEO Elon Musk has sent to his employees.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190520170529-tesla-showroom-0520-super-tease.jpg"}
