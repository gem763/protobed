It has also requested files from the White House itself.\n\nAnd while he has said he will formally object to the impeachment inquiry, Mr Trump acknowledged yesterday that the House of Representatives could easily vote for his removal before the issue is passed on to the senate.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

by his dealings with Ukraine was considering lodging a complaint to run alongside the existing whistleblower statement, according to two sources briefed on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile The Washington Post reported that text messages exchanged by Trump administration officials and Ukraine, made public yesterday, \u201cread like a government-sanctioned shakedown\u201d and that aides had been worried about the president\u2019s calls with foreign leaders \u201cfor some time\u201d.\n\nMembers of Congress have made Mr Trump\u2019s request last summer that Ukraine should investigate Joe Biden the centrepiece of their impeachment probe.\n\nIt follows the whistleblower\u2019s complaint which said that Mr Trump had sought to use military assistance for Ukraine as leverage to push the country\u2019s new president Volodymyr Zelensky towards investigating the 2020 Democratic hopeful.\n\nHe made a related request of China, specifying Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, on Thursday.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address

What the White House released was in fact a memorandum of the conversation, not a transcript.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe so-called Whistleblower\u2019s account of my perfect phone call is \u2018way off,\u2019 not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!\u201d\n\nLater, Mr Trump quoted a Fox News contributor and said that \u201d\u201dSchiff is a FRAUD!\u201d\u201d\n\nJoseph Maguire, the acting Director of National Intelligence, has said the whistleblower\u2019s account of the call was \u201cin alignment\u201d with the White House memo.\n\nMitt Romney, who had criticised his handling of Ukraine and China, was also lambasted by the President. Mr Romney, a former presidential candidate, said: \u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated.\u201d\n\nMr Romney, who ran and lost against Democratic nominee Barack Obama in 2012, has maintained a position of respect within the Republican Party and a fractious relationship with its bombastic figurehead. He added: \u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling.\u201d\n\nAttacking the senator over his failed presidential campaign, Mr Trump tweeted at 9.58am Washington time: \u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics.\n\n\u201cIf Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!\n\n\u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous \u201cass\u201d who has been fighting me from the beginning, except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him), and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn\u2019t give it to him). He is so bad for R\u2019s!\"\n\nIn a later follow up alongside the hastag \"#IMPEACHROMNEY\", he added: \"I\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats\".\n\nThere is no mechanism in place to impeach a senator in the US.\n\nMr Trump has received support from Mr Pompeo, who dismissed questions about his boss\u2019s phone call as a \u201csilly gotcha game.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has every right to have these set of conversations,\u201d Pompeo told reporters while travelling in Greece. He insisted the administration\u2019s foreign efforts were necessary to target graft, ensure aid is spent properly and protect American democracy.\n\nIt is illegal to solicit campaign help from a foreign government.\n\nHowever after taking aim at a range of political rivals he took aim at an old one - his 2016 presidential competitor Hilary Clinton.\n\n\"So Crooked Hillary Clinton can delete and acid wash 33,000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress\", he tweeted, repeating a false claim he made during the election, \"but I can\u2019t make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine? Witch Hunt!\"\n\nWhile Ms Clinton did chose to delete personal emails kept on a server, this happened before any subpoena was issued.\n\nAdditional reporting by AP", "description": "Donald Trump began his weekend in Washington by launching a tirade against Democrats, Republicans, the Ukraine whistleblower complaint and media organisations,\u00a0as the impeachment probe that could unseat him dragged\u00a0in his closest allies.", "authors": ["Vincent Wood"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/12/trump-admits.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
