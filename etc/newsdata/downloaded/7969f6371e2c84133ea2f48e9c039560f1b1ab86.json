For most of his life, the Nizam of Hyderabad was the richest man in the world.\n\nSo rich, in fact, that on finding rats had nibbled through \u00a33 million in old banknotes stuffed into trunks in a palace cellar, he shrugged off the loss.\n\nIt was said the Indian princeling had so much jewellery that the pearls alone would pave Piccadilly Circus, and that he kept brown paper parcels full of emeralds in his bedchamber.\n\nThe seventh Nizam of Hyderabad is pictured at a time when he was one of the richest men in the world\n\nHis collection included the fabled Jacob diamond, a 185-carat gem the size of an ostrich egg and reputedly worth \u00a350 million, that he found in one of his father\u2019s old socks and liked to use as a paperweight.\n\nThis week the legendary profligacy, decadence, debauchery and meanness of the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, who came to power in 1911, were back in the spotlight after the High Court ruled that the Nizam\u2019s two elderly grandsons were entitled to a \u00a335 million fortune that has been languishing in a British bank.\n\nThe Nizam, a 5ft 3in chain-smoker called Sir Mir Osman Ali Khan, was certainly an eccentric.\n\nHe lived in fear of a revolution, and under tarpaulins in his palace gardens stood row upon row of rusting lorries, their tyres perished and sinking into the ground. Each truck was laden with precious stones and gold ingots.\n\nThe lorries were so he could escape with some of his riches if the need came. But then he lost interest and left the trucks to rot.\n\nFor personal protection he had a private army of 3,000 North African bodyguards. He also employed 38 people whose sole job was to dust the palace chandeliers, and a further 28 to fetch drinking water. Several more were employed just to grind his favourite walnuts.\n\nWhen the Queen married Prince Philip in 1947, he presented her with a diamond necklace\n\nSoon after becoming the absolute ruler of 17 million people in an area the size of Italy, he took to roaring about his kingdom in a Rolls-Royce, drank whisky from his own distillery and led his own jazz band in playing his favourite song, I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles.\n\nAt one stage his fortune was said to be \u00a3100 million in gold and silver bullion and \u00a3400 million in jewels \u2014 more than \u00a350 billion at today\u2019s values.\n\nIndian prince's descendants can claim fortune from NatWest after 70 years following High Court ruling The Nizam prince, who ruled Hyderabad in India from 1911 until 1948, transferred \u00a31million to a Natwest bank account and his heirs spent 70 years wrangling to get the money which is now worth \u00a335m As conflict raged following the partition of India, the ruler of Hyderabad needed a way to keep his fortune safe. So he transferred \u00a31million to a NatWest bank account to keep it from the Indian army, which was invading his princely state. The Nizam ruled Hyderabad from 1911 until 1948 as an absolute monarch when it was one of the pre-independent princely states in India. And his heirs then spent the next 70 years wrangling with India and Pakistan over who owns the cash, which has since grown to \u00a335million. Now, the High Court in London has ruled it was his all along in a dispute lasting more decades. The last Nizam of Hyderabad transferred money into the account - as the Indian Army invaded the state in 1948, about one year after India gained independence from British rule. The Nizam's heirs and the governments of India and Pakistan all claimed they were entitled to the money in 1957. Mr Justice Marcus Smith ruled yesterday that the money should go to the Nizam\u2019s grandsons, adding that his motivation for the 1948 transfer was to \u2018keep the fund from India\u2019.\n\nMukarram Jah, pictured centre in blue, is the grandson of Osman Ali Khan, titular Nizam of Hyderabad, and now lives in Turkey. He was the richest man in India until the 1980s when he lost his tag after a costly divorce settlement with his third wife\n\nPrince Mukkaram Jah Bahadur as a young boy\n\nBut over time, he came to take a dismissive view of his wealth. Latterly he became miserly and frugal and wore the same tattered fez for 40 years, knitted his own socks and favoured patched, threadbare clothes that he didn\u2019t change for months, even though he possessed a wardrobe half a mile long that was bulging with exquisite silks, brocades, damasks and muslins.\n\nHe ate simply off a tin plate, smoked hand-rolled cigarettes and supplemented his meals with an occasional opium pill. In old age he slept on a simple veranda which he shared with a tethered goat.\n\nYet despite this austerity, he had a prodigious appetite for sex. Placing hidden cameras in the ceilings and walls of his guest quarters, he assembled India\u2019s largest collection of pornographic pictures \u2014 and in his lifetime supposedly sired 100 sons by 86 mistresses.\n\nEvery night he was said to make a stately progress around his busy seraglio. The man who enjoyed the title His Exalted Highness was known by court flunkeys as \u2018His Exhausted Highness\u2019.\n\nWhen he sailed to Britain in 1934, he chartered his own liner and brought with him his entire harem of senior begums \u2014 women of high social status \u2014 as well as an entourage of 300.\n\nHis fortune was starting to come under pressure, however. The eldest sons of his four legal wives ran up millions in debts and the children of the 42 concubines who used to be presented to him on his birthday, freshly bathed in sandalwood oil, formed a union to force him to support them.\n\nHis collection included the fabled Jacob diamond, a 185-carat gem the size of an ostrich egg and reputedly worth \u00a350 million, that he found in one of his father\u2019s old socks and liked to use as a paperweight\n\nSo the Nizam deposited \u00a31 million, a huge sum in those days, with the Westminster Bank \u2014 now part of NatWest \u2014 in London.\n\nHe feared in particular that the money would be appropriated by the new Indian government after the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. And those funds stayed put, accruing interest to reach the sum of \u00a335 million today.\n\nThe money was the subject of decades of legal wrangling and countless rival claims until the High Court\u2019s ruling that his grandsons are entitled to it.\n\nUnder the 7th Nizam\u2019s autocratic rule, Hyderabad was like something out of the Arabian Nights. It was India\u2019s premier state and he was first among India\u2019s 560 princes or maharajahs.\n\nOne highly profitable custom meant that any subject of the Nizam who was received by him had to leave a calling card in the form of gold and silver coins.\n\nAt four annual galas when he entertained thousands at lavish banquets, he would personally collect these tithes, dropping the gold and silver into separate bags.\n\nThe 1920s Cartier diamond necklace gifted to the Queen is pictured here\n\nHe was once said to have ordered his collection of pearls to be removed from their sacks, to preserve their lustre. It took the servants three days to lay them out.\n\nA Dutch expert who came to value the collection demanded a fee of \u00a325,000 because, he said, the task would take years.\n\nBeloved by the British as India\u2019s most generous host for his donation of \u00a325 million to two world wars \u2014 including a squadron of Spitfires \u2014 the Nizam was an attentive host.\n\nWhen the then Prince of Wales, later the Duke of Windsor, visited him in 1922, the Nizam wanted his guest to feel at home and installed a chamber pot in the royal bedroom that, when the lid was lifted, played the National Anthem.\n\nAnd when the Queen married Prince Philip in 1947, he presented her with a diamond necklace \u2014 she wore it in her 2007 portrait by the American photographer Annie Leibovitz.\n\nGetting around the windswept kingdom required cars and elephants, and the Nizam had plenty of both initially. In 1913, two years after his coronation, a grand Silver Ghost was sent to Hyderabad.\n\nPictured: The seventh Nizam of Hyderabad was so rich, in fact, that on finding rats had nibbled through \u00a33 million in old banknotes stuffed into trunks in a palace cellar, he shrugged off the loss, writes RICHARD KAY\n\nThe handbook stated it was a \u2018semi-state coach\u2019. It was indeed a sort of \u2018throne car\u2019, with gold mountings and upholstered in gold silk brocade.\n\nThis was only one of the Nizam\u2019s 50 Rolls-Royces, as befitted a man who employed 12,000 servants in just one palace.\n\nHe had at least one car adapted to take an elevated rear seat because he felt he should sit higher than his subjects.\n\nWho was Mir Osman Ali Khan Mir Osman Ali Khan was an absolute monarch who ruled the state of Hyderabad from 1911 to 1948. He was one of the wealthiest people of all time and was said to have been worth a staggering \u00a3187 billion ($230bn). During his rule he introduced railways, roads and started to develop airways. After India gained independence in 1947 he didn't want to accede his state to the newly formed nation. A year later the Indian army invaded and he was forced to surrender. Between 1950 and 1956 he was the Rajpramukh of the state. He died in 1967.\n\nHis Rolls-Royce fleet had barely covered 1,000 miles when he died in 1967, aged 80.\n\nIn addition there were another 150 cars \u2014 in later life, when he became more thrifty, he took to riding around in a bone-shaking Model T Ford.\n\nHe once instructed a servant to buy him a new blanket, with strict orders not to pay more than 25 rupees (about 28p today).\n\nThe retainer came back empty-handed because a new blanket cost 35 rupees \u2014 40p \u2014 so the Nizam made do with his old one.\n\nStories of his parsimony began to abound. He was said to have rebuked an ice-cream vendor for charging a \u2018high price\u2019 (3p) and was said to scrawl dinner invitations on bits of paper torn from the bottom of old letters.\n\nHe disciplined himself to live on the equivalent of \u00a31 a week and smoked the cheapest brand of cigarettes, relighting and smoking the discarded butts.\n\nThere were other, more admirable aspects to his character. His rule saw the expansion of roads, railways and the postal system, and he established universities, hospitals and factories. Indeed, he was adored by his subjects.\n\nHis funeral procession was one of the largest ever seen in India but much of his staggering family wealth had been looted and frittered away.\n\nWhat was left of the dwindling fortune passed to the Nizam\u2019s grandson, whom he had named as heir after disinheriting his Old Harrovian playboy son.\n\nThe 8th Nizam emigrated to Australia, where for many years he ran a sheep station. Now 84, it is he and his younger brother, 80-year-old Prince Muffakhan, who stand to finally inherit the last of their grandfather\u2019s fortune.", "description": "RICHARD KAY: For most of his life, the Nizam of Hyderabad was the richest man in the world.", "authors": ["Richard Kay For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/23/19274096-0-image-a-118_1570140529496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
