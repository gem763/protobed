The Washington Post first reported Tuesday morning that Bannon had been thinking about starting an impeachment-related podcast.\n\nBannon said that he is pessimistic about how the White House and Republicans are handling impeachment and that he admires Democrats for having a \u201cwell-oiled Democratic media machine\u201d to help drive the impeachment narrative.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons that the math is getting away from the White House,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take an astrophysicist to see that among independents and even Republicans, you\u2019re starting to see a move against the president on this impeachment issue. It\u2019s not being taken seriously.\u201d\n\nHe said there has been little communication between the White House and Capitol Hill Republicans and \u201cpeople are moving very slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a mortal threat to Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d Bannon said, adding that even if the Republican-controlled Senate clears Trump in a trial, an acquittal might come with conditions that could undermine the president\u2019s agenda.\n\n\u201cPeople should not assume anything here,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Nobody knows nothing,\u2019 as they used to say in the movie business, and that is very true here.\u201d\n\nBannon, who hosted a show on SiriusXM when he headed up the far-right Breitbart website, said just like other radio shows and podcasts, his will have sponsors \u2014 and there will be existing advertisers on the radio stations that will air it. Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign communications director, and Raheem Kassam, a former Breitbart London bureau chief, will be guest hosts of the show.\n\nBannon, who left the White House in August 2017, was severely criticized by Trump after he made critical comments about the president and members of his family. He has worked to get back in Trump\u2019s good graces but is still distrusted by many in the White House.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to do this and offer a platform to at least get the president\u2019s viewpoints, although we will be very even-handed,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/28/a1/8811eb4e417e959250c4cd72dfb9/191022-bannon-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
