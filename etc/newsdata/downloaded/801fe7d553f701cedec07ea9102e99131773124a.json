Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel take a look. Eileen Rivers, USA TODAY Opinion\n\nThis week was busier than most for the Trump administration. Trevor Noah and Jimmy Kimmel take a look.\n\nThis was a busy week for President Donald Trump or, as late-night comic Trevor Noah points out, a busy 24 hours. In that time, he and his administration racked up about half-a-dozen scandalous moments (a potential record).\n\nAmong them: Energy Secretary Rick Perry resigned (causing Jimmy Kimmel to wonder how one of the longest-standing members of Trump's Cabinet will react); House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Trump got into an \"I know you are but what am I\" contest (Noah explains, above); and an ambassador drops a bomb during his testimony about the Ukraine scandal.\n\nTrevor Noah (Photo: Todd Plitt/USA TODAY)\n\nAnd all of this somehow contributes to Trump's genius. How? Noah reveals all in today's Best of Late Night, above.\n\nAfter you watch our favorite jokes from last night's late-night lineup, vote for yours in the poll below.\n\nFollow Eileen Rivers on Twitter @msdc14.\n\nWant more laughs?
