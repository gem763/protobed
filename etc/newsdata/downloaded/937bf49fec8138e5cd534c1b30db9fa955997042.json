(Picture: Getty Images North America)\n\nBillie Eilish has had her ring stolen by a fan, from her finger, during a concert.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 the thing was taken off the singer\u2019s finger during a recent gig. Fans sure are ruthless these days.\n\nThe 17-year-old singer was performing at the Austin City Limits Music Festival when she noticed the piece of jewellery was taken after returning to the stage from an interaction in the crowd.\n\nInstead of rushing off stage or throwing a hissy fit over the ring, she merely encouraged the new owner to \u2018take care\u2019 of it.\n\nShe really is a legend. Duh!\n\nShe was in good spirits about it (Picture: WireImage)\n\nAfter returning to the stage, the visibly annoyed star exclaimed: \u2018Somebody stole my f***ing ring! I guess that\u2019s my fault.\u2019\n\nHowever, it seemed the star didn\u2019t want to let the theft ruin her mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe added: \u2018Keep that s**t. Take care of that s**t. You okay though? Are you okay? Are you crushed? No? Okay, I am\u2026\u2019\n\n\u201cSomebody stole my fucking ring\u201d\n\n\u201cGuess that\u2019s my fault\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeeep that shit\u201d\n\n\u201cTake Care of that shit\u201d\n\nThis is our Queen @billieeilish pic.twitter.com/ND1jBPokVh \u2014 Tbird \ud83e\udd8b (@Tbird_th98) October 13, 2019\n\nIt was at this stage a number of fans in the crowd then began chanting for the return of the ring, calling: \u2018Give it back.\u2019\n\nHowever, Billie urged them not to \u2018worry\u2019 about what had happened as she wasn\u2019t expecting to get it back.\n\nWhich makes us think it wasn\u2019t worth all that much. Still, that\u2019s beside the point, right?\n\nShe said: \u2018The ring is gone for good. It\u2019s OK, don\u2019t worry about it. Whoever has that shit, though, take care of it, OK?\u2019\n\nMeanwhile, the Lovely singer recently admitted she is grateful she didn\u2019t get time to be a \u2018normal teenager\u2019 before her career took off as it means there is no \u2018dirt\u2019 on her that can be exposed.\n\nKind of a grim thought to have, but we can hardly blame her in this era of such rabid cancel culture.\n\nShe said: \u2018There\u2019s a part of me that feels like\u2026 I didn\u2019t get to be a teenager, like, a normal one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018More and more I get more grateful for it happening that young because I feel like, if it happened later, that people would be able to dig up dirt from when I was that age.\n\n\u2018If this hadn\u2019t happened at that age, I would\u2019ve been doing some reckless s**t.\u2019\n\nSilver linings, and all that.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
