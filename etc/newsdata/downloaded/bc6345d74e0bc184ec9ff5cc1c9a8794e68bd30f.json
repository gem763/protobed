He had worked on the Hillary Clinton email server investigation and joined Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation but was kicked off the team and demoted when the texts surfaced.\n\nWhy it matters: This is Trump's first interview since Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation concluded, and he didn't hold back in the wide-ranging phone interview.\n\nOn the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: Trump said he would release the FISA warrants and related documents used by the FBI to investigate his campaign in full and unredacted. He told Hannity he wanted to \"get to the bottom\" of how the long-running Russia collusion narrative began.\n\nOn the Mueller investigation: Trump called it \"an attempted takeover of our government, of our country, an illegal takeover.\"\n\nOn William Barr: Trump said it would never have happened were Attorney General William Barr in the position from the start of his presidency. Barr said in a summary of the Mueller report Sunday that the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign engaged in a conspiracy with Russia. On obstruction of justice, Barr said the report \"does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\"\n\nOn Russia: Trump said Russia would\u2019ve \"much rather\" had Hillary Clinton as president than himself. \"I will tell you this about Russia; if they had anything on me, it would have come out a long time ago,\" he said. \"You look at all of the different things.\"\n\nOn the Green New Deal, spearheaded by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: \"I really do want to campaign against it,\" Trump said. \"It's ridiculous. The new green deal is going nowhere.\"\n\nEditor's note: The section on William Barr has been corrected to show Barr said the Mueller investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired with Russia.", "description": "He also told Fox News Russia preferred a President Hillary Clinton.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/ozo4pOtdZzX1dqEV281NzbXjQjw=/2418x970:5658x2795/1920x1080/2019/03/28/1553742141832.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-28"}
