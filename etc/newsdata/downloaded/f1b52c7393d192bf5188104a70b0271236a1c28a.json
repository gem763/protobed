Plus, the stores help explain the unusual materials used in its shoes, such as wool, tree fiber and sugar cane.\n\n\"The idea of being able to touch, feel and understand the quality of what we're putting into our products is pretty important,\" said Allbirds co-CEO Tim Brown.\n\nFounded five years ago, Allbirds have found its way onto the feet of tech CEOs and movie stars. (Actor Leonardo DiCaprio is an investor.) It opened its first store a year after launching in its hometown of San Francisco.\n\nFILE - In this July 21, 2018, file photo Allbirds co-founder Tim Brown speaks at OZY Fest in Central Park in New York.
