No doubt that the global equity markets look under bearish pressure has been constantly trying to take decisive breakout on either side; seem to be waiting for decisive action on Brexit Deal, Sino-U.S. Tariff Trade and Modi-Trump Trade Deal. But silence over these deals looks evident enough to enhance uncertainty which looks too encouraging for bugs; and look ready to move above $1524 during this week, if the current indecisiveness continues to extend exhaustion in global equity markets.\n\nFinally, I conclude that a decisive move in , on either side \u2013 above the level of 11,784 and below the level of 11,351 on October 24th \u2013 25th, 2019 will result in a directional move during the upcoming week. No doubt that the U.S. equity indices struggled a lot till closing, but hardly gain any momentum; which enhances the probabilities of the prevalence of bearishness till the clear view on gloomy economic and political moves.
