During the European Union referendum in June 2016, flash flooding impeded voting in central London.\n\nLast week, the Lib Dem MP Tim Farron warned that his constituency of Westmorland and Lonsdale had been hit by three severe floods at this time of year in the last 15 years.\n\nCouncil officials in Shetland, part of the Westminster seat of Orkney and Shetland, have warned of the logistical and safety challenges of flying all their ballot boxes to the count centre, which is normally in Kirkwall, the main town in Orkney.\n\nThere are 34 inhabited islands in Orkney and Shetland, many of which are connected by ferry and plane and vulnerable to winter gales. A mid-winter election is likely to lead to increased take-up of postal votes in these places.\n\nThe last December general election took place in 1923. All recent elections have taken place in April, May or June. The last polling day in winter was on 28 February 1974.\n\nThe Met Office said it was close to freezing that day in large parts of Wales, northern England and Scotland. Stornoway in the Western Isles experienced storm-force winds gusting to 69mph (111km/h) and 40mm (1.6in) of rain fell across western England and Wales.\n\nThe AEA said election law required returning officers to take \u201call reasonable steps\u201d to stage a count as soon as practicable after polls closed at 10pm in a UK election, but no later than four hours after polls closed.\n\nLaura Lock, the association\u2019s deputy chief executive, said that put the onus on returning officers to get counting staff and ballot boxes to a count during darkness in mid-winter rather than prioritise safety by postponing the count until the next day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rough seas in Orkney, where officials have warned of the dangers of flying ballot boxes to Kirkwall, the main town.

They face losing their election fee, and professional embarrassment, if the commission rules they should not have postponed the count.\n\nLock said some constituencies covered huge geographical areas. \u201cDo returning officers want to say to their staff, who may need to do a 100-mile round trip to drop off ballot boxes: \u2018Do you want to stay home and keep safe and travel in the morning?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes, we completely understand we want a quick result [in a general election]. We completely understand the results in one or two seats could reveal who will become prime minister, but at some point the safety of staff has to become a consideration, and we need to keep that at the forefront when we experience a bad winter.\u201d\n\nThere are exceptions for European parliament elections. While voting takes place on a Thursday in the UK, the count is delayed until Sunday to ensure counts take place across the EU at the same time. However, the Western Isles has an exemption because working on a Sunday breaches its Sabbatarian tradition of Sunday observance, so its count is delayed until Monday.\n\nAn Electoral Commission spokesperson said it was up to the government and parliament to change the rules, but confirmed that returning officers had to take all reasonable steps to count votes \u201cas soon as practicable after the close of poll at 10pm\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey will have plans in place to manage the poll in their area, including contingency plans to mitigate any risks to the delivery of their plans, such as inclement weather conditions,\u201d the spokesperson said.", "description": "Council officials in Shetland warn of risks of flying ballot boxes to count centres", "authors": ["Severin Carrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3630e9e790582fed31f01f6f9dd7beaaeae2f80/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89d4baa193aaa810bd39e3d88fd0c80e", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
