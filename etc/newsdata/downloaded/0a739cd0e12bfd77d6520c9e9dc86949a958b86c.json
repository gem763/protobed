But once they arrive things immediately begin going to pot. The hotel\u2019s villainous proprietress has a grudge against Luigi. She captures his friends, freezing them in paintings scattered throughout the hotel, which, it turns out, is absolutely crawling with ghosts. Luigi \u2014 brow furrowed from fright, teeth chattering wildly \u2014 sets out to find and free his pals and get to the heart of the hotel\u2019s mysteries.\n\nThe hotel is broken into more than a dozen small floors, each composed of a handful of rooms. It\u2019s a relatively small world compared to those of most games, but each location is bursting with details and secrets, making it surprisingly easy to spend half an hour or more on just a single floor. You\u2019ll want to inspect each piece of furniture and every painting, check behind curtains and under bedclothes, and even take time to peer into mouse holes and cracks in walls to uncover riddles and discover an array of collectibles and rare ghosts.\n\nExploration is all the more appealing because each floor and room has a theme and style all its own. There are VIP suites, a restaurant, a garage, a theatre, and more, each loaded with its own set of secrets and surprises. And it\u2019s all wrapped up in gorgeous graphics and audioscapes, including fantastic fabric physics, realistic lighting effects and wonderfully spooky music and sounds. It\u2019s one of the prettiest games yet made for Switch.\n\nA big part of the fun is figuring out how to put Luigi\u2019s extensive arsenal of goofy gadgets to effective use \u2014 essential to noodling out solutions to the game\u2019s myriad puzzles. He\u2019s equipped with a black light flashlight that can reveal hidden features in paintings, as well as a strobe light that can stun ghosts in their tracks, letting him use a vacuum cleaner to grab hold of their spectral forms and begin sucking them in, Ghostbusters-style. The vacuum can also be used to hoover up sheets and tablecloths as well any money Luigi happens to find. In some situations you can use a reverse flow function to create air gusts that push objects around, or use a suction cup with a rope to latch onto physical objects.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting tool in Luigi\u2019s arsenal, though, is a summonable gooey green clone cleverly dubbed Gooigi, who can be controlled by you or a second player in cooperative play. Gooigi can do anything Luigi can do, and more. His goopy nature means he can slip through bars and grates or squish himself through the hotel\u2019s pipe system. He can also cooperate with Luigi, using their combined strength to tug heavier objects or adjust switches simultaneously. It brings a whole new dimension to the Luigi\u2019s Mansion experience.\n\nThe real excitement, however, comes upon encountering boss ghosts. Each one is a memorable character unto him or herself, from a demented cook to a forlorn TV director. And each one is a puzzle to be solved, requiring creative use of Luigi\u2019s abilities and gizmos to weaken and eventually capture. The solutions can occasionally be devilishly tricky to work out, but \u2014 understanding that most people who play will be kids \u2014 Nintendo\u2019s gamesmiths have included a helpful contextual hint system that players can call on for situation-specific tips. I\u2019m not shy to say I used it more than once, and found it infinitely preferable to searching out hammy user-created walkthroughs on YouTube.\n\nIn addition to the lengthy single-player mode, Nintendo has also included a local/online cooperative mode for up to eight players as well as a handful of competitive Mario Party-ish mini-games, which I\u2019m sure will appeal to kids looking to play in groups.\n\nBut it\u2019s the story that\u2019s the main draw. Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 is the best entry yet in this frequently snubbed Nintendo franchise, and one of the most original and entertaining plays of the year. There\u2019s no shortage of great games available for Switch, but this one is a standout.", "description": "Mario's easily-spooked sibling takes on a luxury hotel full of wonderfully memorable creepy characters in the series' best game yet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/luigi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
