It\u2019s natural, it\u2019s healthy, to start to ask those questions of the former darlings of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nThe tech conversation kicked off with a question from the moderators about whether the candidates supported Sen.

But for months, candidates have hedged and side-stepped about where they come down on the issue, sporadically offering smaller-scale proposals to rein in Big Tech.\n\nNone of the other candidates, though, explicitly endorsed Warren\u2019s approach, which would impose tougher antitrust rules and require companies including Google and Facebook to spin off elements of their businesses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up,\u201d former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) said. But he added, \u201cWe will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that.\u201d\n\nSen.

Harris has pressed Twitter on the issue, arguing that Trump has used the social media platform to incite violence and spread baseless accusations. And at the debate she challenged Warren over the issue. Warren herself is pushing Facebook to crack down on disinformation but has declined to join Harris\u2019s efforts on Twitter.\n\nIn a memorable exchange, she told the California senator her focus was getting Trump out of the White House, not off Twitter. Warren said the U.S. could better deal with tech companies by beefing up and enforcing the antitrust laws on the books.\n\nJohn Newman, a former Justice Department antitrust attorney who\u2019s now an assistant professor of law at the University of Memphis, said political watchers would need to go back over a century to find the last time antitrust issues played such a prominent role in a campaign.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d really have to go back to 1912, to the last great antitrust debates, to see any kind of parallel,\u201d Newman said. \u201cAnd at least back in the day, it was a harbinger of big things to come.\u201d\n\nBut industry voices downplayed the talk of reining in Big Tech.\n\nSteve DelBianco, the president of tech trade group NetChoice, called the criticisms \u201cpredictable.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt plays to their base to show that they\u2019re standing up to big companies and that they care about election security, privacy, violent and extreme content.\u201d\n\nWarren and Yang also clashed over the impact of automation during the debate. Warren defended remarks that automation was a \u201cgood story\u201d blaming bad policies for the loss of jobs.\n\nBut Yang fired back, telling Warren, \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Americans around the country about automation, and they\u2019re smart. They see ... Main Street stores are closing, they see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald\u2019s, every grocery store, every CVS.\u201d\n\nA number of Democratic candidates have unveiled proposals to address the so-called gig economy and how those companies treat workers.\n\nThe candidates were far more united on the issue of addressing election security, with the candidates uniformly calling for more steps to protect U.S. elections in the future.\n\nSen.

But the bill has not moved in the Senate.\n\nYang saw election security as part of a broader problem.\n\nHe noted that Russia\u2019s election interference efforts were an \u201cillustration of 21st century threats,\u201d citing cybersecurity, military drones and artificial intelligence as issues confronting the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe all know we are decades behind the curve on technology,\u201d Yang said, vowing to close that gap if elected president.", "description": "Democratic divisions over how to tackle Big Tech were on display at the latest primary debate as presidential contenders sparred over whether to break up Silicon Valley\u2019s giants, how social media should handle President Trump\u2019s tweets and whether the government is doing enough to prevent interference in U.S. elections using social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/demcandidates_debate_duotone_getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
