Gen. Antonio Aguto struggled to hold back tears at a news conference as he read the names of the soldiers who died Sunday during the exercise hours before dawn.\n\nSgt. 1st Class Bryan Jenkins, 41, of Gainesville, Florida; Cpl. Thomas Walker, 22, of Conneaut, Ohio; and Pfc. Antonio Garcia, 21, of Peoria, Arizona, all died. Three others were injured.\n\n'It is hard enough when you lose one soldier,' Aguto said. 'But when you lose three at one time, that pain is amplified. And we are really feeling and sharing that pain.'\n\nSgt. 1st Class Bryan Jenkins, 41, of Gainesville, left, Antonio Garcia, 21, of Peoria, Arizona, (center) and Cpl. Thomas Cole Walker, 22, of Conneaut, Ohio (right)\n\nThomas Cole Walker, 22, from Conneaut, Ohio. He is pictured here with his younger sister\n\nWalker was married to Taylor, 19, pictured here in both photos, together with her husband, 22,\n\nThe soldiers belonged to the 1st Armored Brigade of the Fort Stewart-based 3rd Infantry Division. Aguto said the deadly crash happened shortly before 3.30am Sunday as the brigade was training for a rotation early next year at the Army's National Training Center in California.\n\nSix soldiers were riding in a Bradley fighting vehicle in a training area of the sprawling Army post southwest of Savannah when it 'rolled off a bridge and was submerged upside down in a stream', Aguto said.\n\nThe wife of Thomas Cole Walker, Taylor, wrote an emotional note on Facebook.\n\n'You were my soulmate. You made the world a better place for me. I never thought the day would come where I'd lose my husband, partner, & the love of my life. I am so thankful a beautiful kind soul like you came into my life. I'm so thankful I was married to you even if our time together was short. You had big plans. We both did. You will always make me proud and from now on everything I do will be for you. You have my heart Thomas Walker. You always will. God had other plans for us. I love you forever & always my dear. And I'll continue to make green bean casserole & Korean spaghetti for you.'\n\nThe teenage wife also referenced another of Walker's colleagues who died alongside him.\n\nPfc. Antonio Garcia, 21, of Peoria, Arizona, pictured in both, had just joined the Army last year . Heis pictured with his girlfriend, right\n\n'This is going to be without a doubt the hardest thing I've ever had to do as a 19 year old girl, but I'm trying. Just know that I'm thankful for everyone.'\n\nGarcia's family also released a statement regarding their fallen family member.\n\n''As a family we are shocked and devastated by the loss of our beloved Antonio. While his time was far too short, we are so thankful and appreciative of the time we had with him. He was the most brave, kind-hearted and loving person we have had the privilege of knowing. He loved his family, friends and his country. We love him with every fiber of our beings and we will cherish and celebrate his life and carry on his memory forever. We ask that others do the same, while also respecting the privacy and space we need to heal in such a heart-breaking time.'\n\nArmy Maj. Gen. Antonio Aguto, left, spoke through tears as he held a news conference alongside Army accident investigator Michael Barksdale about a training accident that killed three soldiers and injured three others\n\nAguto and Michael Barksdale, the Army's lead investigator on the crash, declined to give further details such as how far the vehicle fell and the depth of the water.\n\nThe Army is conducting autopsies to determine how the soldiers died.\n\nInvestigators from the Army Combat Readiness Center at Fort Rucker, Alabama, expect to take up to four weeks before giving Fort Stewart commanders a preliminary report, Barksdale said.\n\nThree other soldiers in the vehicle were injured. Two were treated and released from an Army hospital the day of the crash. The third remained hospitalized Monday with injuries that weren't considered life-threatening, Aguto said.\n\nThe training exercise being conducted early Sunday had been planned and rehearsed ahead of time, Aguto said.\n\nAnd while the remnants of Tropical Storm Nestor swept across southeast Georgia late Saturday and early Sunday, Aguto said there had been no severe weather warnings and the storm's rain and winds had already passed before the crash occurred.\n\nAt least 12 Army soldiers have died in nine training accidents across the U.S. in 2019, including the crash Sunday at Fort Stewart, according to the Army Combat Readiness Center, which investigates fatal accidents.\n\n'The training is tough, realistic and we train for all sorts of conditions no matter where we would go,' Aguto said. 'You would expect us to do that. And that was the case in this instance.'\n\nAguto said Fort Stewart would plan a memorial service for the soldiers who died. Jenkins recently finished his 18th year in the Army having joined just three days after 9/11.\n\nA decorated soldier, he served two tours in Iraq in 2005 and 2008.\n\nHe also received the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Jenkins has been stationed at Ft. Stewart since 2014.\n\nWalker and Garcia, roughly 20 years younger, had never deployed overseas. Walker enlisted in 2016 and had been stationed at Ft. Stewart for three years, while Garcia joined the Army last year and had been stationed at Fort Stewart since joining.\n\nSix soldiers were riding in a Bradley fighting vehicle tank, similar to one pictured.
