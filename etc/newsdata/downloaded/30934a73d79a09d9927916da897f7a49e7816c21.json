What makes the accomplishment all the more remarkable is that Sarah Thomas is a 37-year-old breast cancer survivor who completed treatment a year ago.\n\nThomas, a Colorado resident who is an open-water ultra-marathon swimmer, began her swim in the early Sunday and finished Tuesday \u2014 54 hours later. She had expected to swim a total of 80 miles, but the strong tide in the English Channel increased the distance and made her feat closer to 130 miles.\n\n\"I just can't believe we did it,\" Thomas told BBC News once she came ashore in Dover. \"I'm really just pretty numb. There was a lot of people on the beach to meet me and wish me well and it was really nice of them, but I feel just mostly stunned.\"\n\nAccording to the BBC, before Thomas completed her record-breaking fourth leg, only four swimmers had ever swum three legs across the Channel without stopping. Thomas followed Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation Rules as she wore only a swim cap, goggles, and bathing suit. During her 54-hour swim, she ate only a protein mixed drink made with caffeine and electrolytes. She persisted despite being stung in the face by a jellyfish.\n\nLewis Pugh, a British-South African distance swimmer, took to Twitter on Tuesday to congratulate Thomas. He called her feat \"superhuman!!\"\n\nExtraordinary, amazing, super-human!!! Just when we think we\u2019ve reached the limit of human endurance, someone shatters the records. Huge congratulations to Sarah Thomas on swimming the English Channel 4x continuously!!! \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 \ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7\ud83c\udfca\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f pic.twitter.com/kOa9QlereH \u2014 Lewis Pugh (@LewisPugh) September 17, 2019\n\nThomas completed her record-breaking swim across the English Channel to raise awareness for breast cancer. She dedicated her swim to other survivors. When she arrived on land, Thomas ate M&M's and took a sip of champagne, though she said it was difficult to swallow because all of the salt water had affected her mouth.\n\nBBC News reports Thomas is an experienced open-water swimmer who completed her first event in 2007. She first swam across the Channel in 2012 and once more in 2016.", "description": "Sarah Thomas, 37, survived breast cancer last year before swimming 130 miles \u2014 four times across the Channel \u2014 to set a record", "authors": ["Brian Pascus"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/17/36ea3b26-52b5-4cbb-8829-c41dfdeccf23/thumbnail/1200x630/0fb27b97ef01cef47971a69514b7f371/swim.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
