But even Democrats acknowledge concern that Trump\u2019s unique ability to rally his supporters and marshal resources could have a profound impact on the 2020 election.\n\nTara McGowan, a Democratic digital strategist who worked for a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC in 2016, said that Trump\u2019s \u201cability to very quickly define any event or issue on his terms and energize his base\u201d through online advertising \u201cprovides him with a huge competitive advantage over Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis approach enables Trump to set the narrative on his terms and paint himself as the iconoclast that is always under attack from the \u2018fake news media\u2019 and Democratic \u2018witch hunt,\u2019 and it clearly works as they continue to perpetuate it every chance they get,\u201d McGowan added.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

With 24-hour cable news stations airing near-constant coverage of impeachment, Parscale has privately compared the campaign to a marketing machine that is setting its own narrative.\n\nTrump has spent years priming his supporters to see him as under attack, and aides say their fundraising is typically at its highest when he\u2019s perceived as in danger. The campaign, for example, raised $1 million in the 24 hours following the release of former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nBut the threat of impeachment, Trump allies say, has turbocharged giving.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re under attack, your supporters are more engaged and that\u2019s the general position [of the campaign\u2019s messaging] \u2014 that \u2018We\u2019re under siege,\u2019 and \u2018We need your help,' and \u2018This is ridiculous,\u2019 and \u2018Let\u2019s fight back,\u2019\u201d said Gerrit Lansing, who serves as president of WinRed, the online donation processor used by the Trump campaign. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a powerful message.\u201d\n\nWith the White House choosing to forgo an impeachment-focused war room, much of the messaging is being outsourced to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. The two organizations, working closely with one another, have sent out dozens of statements, tweets, and video clips designed to cast the president as the prey of a Democratic Party out to destroy him. On Monday, the RNC unveiled a rapid response program focused on impeachment.\n\nTrump\u2019s political machine has enabled him to capitalize financially on impeachment in a way he struggled to when confronting past political crises. Veterans of Trump\u2019s disorganized 2016 campaign, for example, said the firestorm caused by the release of the lewd \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video did not prompt anything near the protective response from supporters that the impeachment push has generated.\n\nFor the Trump campaign, perhaps the biggest prize of its recent efforts is the 50,000 new donors. Trump aides will be able to ask them for cash repeatedly in the months to come. And now that the party has their contact information and other personal data, turning those voters out next year will be far easier.\n\n\u201cThese are the same types of people who will vote with their wallets,\u201d said Zac Moffatt, the digital director on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re on the team. They\u2019re unlikely [to be] coming off that now.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/895/1155968404_6090747453001_6090743461001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nParscale has briefed the president on the impeachment-focused fundraising effort and has told him that the amount he\u2019s receiving in donations is one of the clearest indicators of how the impeachment battle is playing out.\n\nFlush with cash, the campaign has chosen to plow $8 million into a nationally aired televison ad tying former Vice President Joe Biden to Ukraine and accusing Democrats of plotting to \u201csteal\u201d the 2020 election. Trump, who has signaled to White House aides that he\u2019s eager to go after Biden, personally signed off on the purchase after son-in-law Jared Kushner broached the idea, according to an administration official.\n\nThe RNC has separately begun its own TV ads going after House Democrats from districts Trump won in 2016 who\u2019ve given their support to the impeachment inquiry.\n\nDemocrats have generally been more reluctant to fundraise off impeachment, though several Democratic candidates have sent out appeals tied to the investigation. Spokespersons for the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said they\u2019d taken steps to raise money from their supporters but declined to provide specifics on how much they\u2019d taken in.\n\nSome Democrats express discomfort about the prospect of financially capitalizing off what they describe as a serious process.\n\n\u201cDemocrats just aren't as motivated and excited by the specter of removing the president as they are by soundly defeating him next year. And there's a conscious effort to avoid overly politicizing a legal process,\u201d said Daniel Scarvalone, a veteran Democratic digital strategist. \u201cI wouldn't be shocked if Democrats continued to tiptoe around the issue, because there just isn't as much upside for it as there is for Republicans.\u201d\n\nBut while Trump reaps the rewards of playing to his base, some senior Republicans caution that he\u2019ll eventually need to woo swing voters to be successful in 2020.\n\nRepublican strategist Karl Rove, the architect of George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 reelection, said Trump\u2019s fundraising numbers were indicative of a tribal moment in politics \u201cwhere if the president is attacked, his supporters will react by becoming even more revved up and come to his defense in whatever way they can.\u201d\n\nBut Rove added that the Democratic and Republican bases were fully engaged and that both parties would need to compete for a relatively small group of swing voters who were likely to decide the outcome of the election.\n\n\u201cI think it is a huge mistake for people to say, \u2018Oh, well we can win this by simply focusing on the base alone,\u2019\u201d said Rove. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a successful presidential re-elect that was focused on the base and the base only.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9b/d7/55919e2643efba68940b79e4bcde/19930-trump-rally-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
