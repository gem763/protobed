The governing coalition, which is comprised of the anti-establishment 5Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party (PD), voted for changes alongside the far-right League, the far-right Brothers of Italy and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia.\n\nCutting more than a third of seats was one of the 5Stars' flagship campaign pledges as part of their historic battle to cut the cost of politics and slash privileges for lawmakers. According to economists' calculations, the decrease would allow the state to save between \u20ac285 and \u20ac500 million per five-year parliamentary term \u2014 which critics have slammed as \"petty\" figures.\n\nTuesday's vote is the fourth on the 5Stars' proposed seat number reform and marks the first time the PD has voted in favor of the 5Stars' plan.\n\nIn 2016, the PD government proposed a different, more far-reaching reform to cut the number of lawmakers and change the country's parliamentary system, but the plan was rejected by voters in a referendum that led to Matteo Renzi's resignation as prime minister.\n\nRenzi's new party, made up of lawmakers who split from the PD last month but who remain part of the governing coalition, also voted in favor of the proposal on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the 5Stars' coalition with the far-right League collapsed this summer, 5Stars leader Luigi Di Maio said it was absolutely vital the number of lawmakers was cut before Italians head back to the polls. (A new election was averted by the 5Stars agreeing to form a coalition with the PD.)\n\nBut the 5Stars' proposal (like Renzi's in 2016) has been strongly criticized by some law experts who argue it will decrease democratic representation.\n\nItaly's current ratio is 1.6 lawmakers per 100,000 inhabitants. After the reform, it will become approximately 1 lawmaker per 100,000 \u2014 which critics say is too low and will end up concentrating too much power in the hands of party leaders.\n\nTo compare, Germany has a ratio of 0.9 lawmakers per 100,000 inhabitants, France's ratio is 1.4 lawmakers per 100,000 inhabitants and the U.K.'s ratio is about 2.1 lawmakers per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe comparison is not straightforward, however: In the U.K., members of the House of Lords are not elected, unlike Italian senators. And while Germany's upper chamber, the Bundesrat, consists of only 69 members \u2014 representatives of federal states \u2014 the 16 states also have their own regional parliaments with a combined seat number of more than 1,800.", "description": "Italians will have to approve reform cutting a third of parliamentary seats in a referendum.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1167229116-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
