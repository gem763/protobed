Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-NY) multi-trillion-dollar ploy to curb so-called global warming was laughable. It\u2019s laughable when climate alarmists point to hurricanes being formed during\u2026hurricane season as evidence that there is global warming. It\u2019s funny when they rage about how hot\u2026summer is to suggest we\u2019re getting closer to Armageddon. The same clowns who peddled this garbage are the same ones who said the Earth would undergo re-glaciation because of global cooling in the 1970s. It didn\u2019t happen. They were wrong. And I\u2019m not willing to cannibalize trillions in economic growth and activity based on the very people who have been wrong about this for decades. The doomsday prediction has rolled in by the fist-full and none of this nonsense has come true. None. I\u2019m not about to sign off on self-induced economic destitution to satisfy the liberal elite who hate America and want to cripple us in some backdoor maneuver to get their authoritarian and over-regulatory agenda enacted through the guise of helping mother Earth. To show how unserious this crew is, we have people suggesting that we eat human flesh to combat global warming (via NY Post):\n\nStockholm School of Economics professor and researcher Magnus Soderlund reportedly said he believes eating human meat, derived from dead bodies, might be able to help save the human race if only a world society were to \u201cawaken the idea.\u201d Soderlund\u2019s argument for human cannibalism was front and center during a panel talk called \u201cCan You Imagine Eating Human Flesh?\u201d at the Gastro Summit, reports the Epoch Times. \u201cConservative\u201d taboos against cannibalism, he said, can change over time if people simply tried eating human flesh. Some of the talking points at the seminar included whether humans were too selfish to \u201clive sustainably\u201d and if cannibalism is the solution to food sustainability in the future. When asked during an interview after his talk if he personally would try human flesh, Soderlund said he was open to the idea.\n\nCannibalism. That\u2019s an option to fight this so-called trend, huh? Yeah, and people wonder why this issue isn\u2019t really on the minds of normal people. The folks crying foul are insane.\n\nAnd don\u2019t these people know the dangers of eating human flesh. If the 1999 film Ravenous tells us anything, it\u2019s that once consumed, you\u2019ll become addicted forever a cannibal and a total monster. Of course, that\u2019s fantasy, but heck\u2014we\u2019re dealing with a cast of characters who are totally unspooled when it comes to this issue. It\u2019s one that will screw over rural and middle-class Americans. The electric bills for these people and fixed-income seniors will be nuked. It\u2019s a de facto tax increase to help rich, wealthy liberals feel better about themselves living in cities. It\u2019s a covert attempt to cripple those who don\u2019t vote for liberal causes, especially seeing how these policies are going to impact the country. It\u2019s very red-state centric when it comes to the economic damage.", "description": ".09/09/2019 19:18:35PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/19/e06d8277-e921-401f-9207-91ce9ffddb5d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
