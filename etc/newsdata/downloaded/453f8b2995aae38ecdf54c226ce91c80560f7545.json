(Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters)\n\nAn unauthorized march against totalitarianism and Beijing\u2019s grip on Hong Kong quickly devolved into chaos Sunday, as police fired rounds of tear gas and made arrests to stop the crowd of thousands from protesting \u2014 kicking off another day of conflict in what has become the new normal in this global financial hub.\n\nIt was among the most aggressive police responses in the 17 weeks of demonstrations, amid growing sensitivity over the rapidly approaching anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Several people were seriously injured, including an Indonesian journalist based in Hong Kong who was hit in the eye by a projectile while live-streaming the event for her publication.\n\nAs police intensify their efforts to crush the protests, they are facing more resistance from ordinary people who are increasingly joining protests and hurling abuse at officers.\n\nDespite the forceful police response, the protesters persevered and scattered across central areas of the city. Some set fires, broke windows at subway stations and threw bricks at officers. Street battles broke between protesters and police who struggled to keep the demonstrators at bay with rubber bullets and tear gas.\n\n[\u2018We are back\u2019: Hong Kong protesters mark anniversary of Umbrella Movement in face of police water cannons ]\n\nResidents and tourists were caught in the crossfire, clutching their faces and running in fear in several areas, including the neon-lit luxury shopping district of Causeway Bay.\n\nAbout 5 p.m., police launched an aggressive clearance operation against protesters occupying Harcourt Road, where clashes have broken out frequently during the past four months. Police pushed young demonstrators to the asphalt road and dragged them away, leaving pools of blood. Hong Kong\u2019s hospital authority said 13 people were admitted to hospitals by 7:30 p.m., including one in serious condition.\n\nThe protesters are determined to show Beijing that they wholly reject the erosion of their promised freedoms and see this as their opportunity to push for the right to directly elect the leaders of the city.\n\n\u201cIf they respect us, then we will respect them,\u201d said Michael, a 28-year-old protester who works in the banking industry. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t respect our democracy or human rights, then why do I need to respect them?\u201d\n\nProtesters tore down signs and flags hoisted in advance of the 70th anniversary celebrations, setting fire to some.\n\n\n\nAnti-government protesters run away from amid blue-coloured sprayed water during a demonstration near the Legislative Council building. (Athit Perawongmetha/Reuters)\n\nAt times, riot police appeared outnumbered. Shoppers at a luxury mall in central Hong Kong looked on as police and protesters engaged in a pitched battle. Protesters crouched, created a phalanx of umbrellas and tossed bricks and bottles toward the officers. Police fired round after round of tear gas.\n\nThe protesters inched forward as rubber bullets shredded their umbrellas. When it appeared the police might be outflanked, officers made a hasty retreat. Protesters seized the moment, rushing toward officers piling into police vans.\n\nDemonstrators, cheered by onlookers and fellow marchers, hit the vans with poles and bottles as the vehicles sped away. The road was littered with glass and spent tear-gas canisters clinked across the asphalt as the protesters continued their march.\n\nAt nightfall in the nearby neighborhood of Wan Chai, residents left their homes and workplaces to jeer at police and pelt their vehicles with bricks and bottles.\n\nPolice responded by firing tear gas into the crowd, which included elderly residents.\n\nSeveral protesters were hurt during the day, including one who was briefly unconscious and another who was dragged away by several officers because he couldn\u2019t walk. Several bled while ambulances rushed to the scene.\n\n\n\nRiot police officers fire tear gas to disperse anti-government protesters after a march in Hong Kong.

Officers frisked the protesters and took them away. A spokeswoman for the police force said she could not immediately give the number of arrests.\n\nAfter one clash, police regrouped and then charged protesters. \u201cGo, go, go,\u201d a commanding officer shouted as dozens of tactical and riot officers sprinted down the street. Officers tackled demonstrators, pinning them to the ground and blocking journalists\u2019 cameras as they made arrests.\n\n\"Go, Go, Go!\" Raptor and riot police charge toward Pacific Place in Hong Kong this afternoon appeared to be lead by Rupert Dover. pic.twitter.com/3WHLCfGLdZ \u2014 Timothy McLaughlin (@TMclaughlin3) September 29, 2019\n\nThe protest movement was sparked in June by a bill that would have allowed the extradition of criminal defendants from Hong Kong to mainland China. The bill has since been withdrawn, but protesters\u2019 demands have grown to include direct elections for Hong Kong leaders and an independent investigation into police use of force, amid growing sentiment that officers have acted with impunity during the demonstrations. The movement has also taken on a distinctly anti-Beijing flavor.\n\nProtesters have become increasingly aware of the risks of their continued participation in the demonstrations. Police have arrested more than 1,500 people in the past four months with charges including rioting, unlawful assembly, assaulting police officers and possession of offensive weapons. After demonstrations ended Saturday and Sunday, police stopped and searched young people in buses, trams, at convenience stores and elsewhere in the city.\n\nOne of the many arrests from the resulting police charge today in Hong Kong.

Sometimes he feels like throwing up, he says, worrying that he could be the next to be cuffed and hauled away. He gave only his first name because the demonstration was unauthorized.\n\n\u201cIf this is our path to democracy, then it is a sacrifice I am willing to make,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFight for Hong Kong!\u201d he shouted amid the marching crowd. \u201cStand with freedom!\u201d\n\n\n\nAn anti-government protester throws a molotov cocktail towards riot police officers inside the Wan Chai station during a demonstration in Hong Kong.
