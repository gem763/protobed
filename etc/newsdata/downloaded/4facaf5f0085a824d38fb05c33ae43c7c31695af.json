Elizabeth Warren speaks during the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Saturday. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images 2020 elections We asked 100 New Hampshire insiders about the Democratic field. Here's who they favor. The 1,280 most influential Democrats in the state hosted 19 presidential hopefuls on Saturday for the party's annual convention.\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. \u2014 Joe Biden found little mojo for his candidacy among Democratic Party insiders at their state convention here Saturday, despite leading the polls in the first-in-the-nation primary state.\n\nDozens of state representatives, party leaders, operatives and volunteers said they weren\u2019t planning to vote for the former vice president in the nomination contest \u2014 and many publicly aired concerns about his age, energy and gender.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA striking number of party activists said they were undecided as 19 presidential candidates delivered stump speeches over seven hours at the SNHU Arena, according to interviews with 100 delegates by POLITICO.\n\nElizabeth Warren led the way among the surveyed delegates who had made up their minds, followed by Bernie Sanders in second and Biden in third.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to criticize any other Democrat or anyone else\u2019s campaign,\u201d Warren told reporters. \u201cWhat I saw in that room were a whole lot of Democrats here in New Hampshire who are not only ready for change. They\u2019re ready to get out there.\u201d\n\nJust over half of the 100 delegates said they haven't picked a candidate yet. Of those who have decided, a third named Warren as their favorite.\n\n\"I think that Joe Biden is too old to be president,\u201d said Richard Post, a 26-year-old delegate who is undecided. \u201cWe need someone who is younger, more attached to the future of the planet.\u201d\n\nThe complaints about Biden from party soldiers often centered on his campaigning skills, and a desire for more diversity in Democratic leadership. Notably, few undecided delegates named Biden when asked who they were leaning toward.\n\n\"I'm tired of old white guys telling me what to do,\u201d said Rachel Cisto, an uncommitted delegate who is leading toward Warren or Sanders.\n\nWarren, on the other hand, showed significant strength among those who said they hadn\u2019t selected a candidate, but were moving toward one or more contenders. Of the undecided delegates surveyed, a third said they're leaning towards Warren, either exclusively or as part of a small list of others.\n\nWarren had also won the support of a handful of people who backed Sanders four years ago.\n\n\"She has the most thought-out policies, and I'm particularly in favor of Medicare for All,\u201d said Jessica LaMontague, who voted for Sanders in 2016. \u201cI think Bernie's a little too old and grumpy.\"\n\nSupporters hold up signs for Sen. Bernie Sanders during the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention on Saturday. | Scott Eisen/Getty Images\n\nDressed in her trademark \"liberty green\" T-shirts, Warren\u2019s supporters swarmed the convention. When Warren took the stage, the audience exploded, at one point chanting \u201c2 cents, 2 cents!\u201d in reference to her proposed wealth tax. Sanders also received an enthusiastic welcome from the crowd.\n\nWarren and Sanders are familiar faces in New Hampshire, living in bordering states and visiting more frequently than Biden. Both progressives have high expectations in the state due to the proximity and other factors. Sanders won the New Hampshire primary by 22 points in 2016.\n\n\u201cI met him in 1996 and had a chance to talk to him,\u201d said delegate Mark King of Sanders, who he is supporting. \u201cHe talks about the same things and has the same attitudes he had back then.\u201d\n\nBiden has strong connections and endorsements in the state, some of which go back to when he first started running for president in 1987, making his lack of support among the surveyed delegates notable. One of Biden\u2019s most formidable allies in the state confronted him during his trip to the state this week, warning him to speak less and be more concise in his answers.\n\n\"I like all of them very much,\u201d said Carol Shea Porter, a former New Hampshire congresswoman and delegate who has endorsed Biden. \u201cBut because of his experience in the White House and experience on the international stage, he is probably the person who can best remind ourselves and the world of who we are.\u201d\n\nThe 1,280 party delegates who gave up their Saturday to cheer on their party are key to the ground game in New Hampshire: They\u2019re some of the most willing Democrats in the state to make calls, knock on doors and plant lawn signs. They run town and county committees and are instrumental in the retail politicking of the first primary state.\n\n\u201cThese are the 1,280 most influential Democrats in the state,\u201d said New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley.\n\nThe delegates are selected in local elections throughout the state. In off years, they would vote on platform issues, but this year will only serve as party evangelists.\n\nLocal powerbrokers met privately with candidates in private suites at the arena during the day. Several hopefuls moved from suite to suite, kissing rings of party leaders, unions and some of their campaigns\u2019 biggest backers. Biden spent a significant amount of time at the International Association of Fire Fighters\u2019 room, shaking hands with everyone and whipping out cash to buy a non-alcoholic drink.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign did less so-called \u201cvisibility\u201d outside of the convention than other campaigns, opting instead to organize, aides said. A staffer said his team knocked on more than 9,000 doors on Saturday as of 4 p.m., and Sanders greeted a large crowd of volunteers at a canvass kickoff at a local pub after he spoke at the convention.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign this week downplayed expectations in Iowa and New Hampshire, upsetting some of his strongest supporters here who said he needs to make fixes to his campaign in early states to win.\n\nSanders and Warren made remarks during their speeches Saturday that could be interpreted as subtle jabs at Biden. \u201cIt is not enough just to defeat Trump,\u201d said Sanders. And Warren commented, \u201cWe can\u2019t ask other people to vote for someone we don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nThe latest poll of likely New Hampshire voters, conducted more than a month ago by Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, showed Biden in the lead with 21 percent, followed by Sanders at 17 and Warren at 14. It also found that half of the general electorate was undecided, similar to the party operatives interviewed Saturday.\n\nThe largely friendly tone among the different campaigns\u2019 supporters and \u201cAnybody But Trump\u201d signs were a stark contrast to the event in 2016. The party\u2019s annual convention that year was marred by chants and boos, forcing former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schutlz to stop speaking.\n\nIn a sign of unity this year, hundreds of delegates agreed to hold signs for whichever candidate was speaking at the time, regardless of which contender they backed personally. The only jeers were when several candidates couldn\u2019t remember or pronounce the names of the state\u2019s congressional members.\n\n\u201cWhoever wins the primary is who I\u2019m supporting,\u201d said delegate Stephanie Vuolo, adding that she is undecided in the race for the nomination.", "description": "The 1,280 most influential Democrats in the state hosted 19 presidential hopefuls on Saturday for the party's annual convention.", "authors": ["Holly Otterbein", "Trent Spiner"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fd/b5/72d25a91464089e8bfe3f9fd0fda/1997-warren-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
