Adobe\u2019s PDF services will be available from the ribbon inside web versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. Office 365 commercial users will be able to convert documents into PDFs all while preserving font choices, formatting, layouts, and password protection.\n\nThe PDF integration follows news of Microsoft\u2019s plans to redesign its Office web apps to be more modern and a lot faster to use. Microsoft is starting to test a simplified ribbon for Office.com and its Office desktop apps, and Office on the web will now include avatars for comments and dedicated colors for participants who are also viewing and editing the same document.\n\nAdobe worked with Microsoft on the PDF integration, following the company\u2019s e-signature solution becoming preferred for Office 365 usage. Microsoft and Adobe have worked increasingly closely in recent years, and a closer partnership started around the time both companies teamed up to improve Photoshop on touchscreens back in 2014. Adobe is also integrating its PDF services into OneDrive and SharePoint, alongside deeper integration in Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics 365.", "description": "Microsoft and Adobe are extending their close partnership this week with the integration of Adobe PDF services into Office 365.
