That drought, atop years of record breaking temperatures, had helped spur the creation of enormous wildfires. Many wondered if 2019 would be a quieter wildfire season.\n\nAnd for awhile it was. This summer wildfires for much of the West were fewer than normal, moisture levels were normal according to the National Drought Monitor, and there were relatively mild fall temperatures. These factors make the recent wildfires currently burning in the state all the more alarming.\n\nPark Williams, an assistant research professor at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, said that there are three main factors that impact California\u2019s fall fire season.\n\nDelayed Rains\n\nCalifornia, like much of the West, gets most of its moisture in the fall and winter. Its vegetation then spends much of the spring and summer slowly drying ou t from warm summer temperatures and lack of additional rainfall. In fact, one of the reasons that hotter temperatures are associated with wildfire is simply because things \u2014 including plants \u2014 dry out faster when the temperatures are higher. And drier vegetation is easier to ignite, with brushes and grasses serving as the kindling to ignite larger fires.", "description": "California's eight years of drought officially ended in March, but wildfires are still engulfing parts of the state.
