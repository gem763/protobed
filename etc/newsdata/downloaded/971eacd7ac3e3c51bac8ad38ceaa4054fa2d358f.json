The truce allowed the soldiers to mingle, exchange headgear, and according to some, they were lured to get in a game of soccer.\n\nThe war was only in its fifth month and the new Pope had only taken his position in September, so there was a degree of hope in the air. As it turns out, World War I would last another 46 months, and the death toll would reach 15 million lives.\n\nStill, that truce showed even the worst of enemies could show mutual compassion even if it only lasted two days. Conversely, it also underscored the fact that warring parties like to win those wars no matter how ugly and deadly.\n\nWhich brings us to what some are calling a truce between the United States and China. Since 70% of trade between the two nations is still in effect, it\u2019s hard to call it a truce or a deal. However, it\u2019s the kind of pause that could turn the tide.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) sees an extensive economic impact in 2020 from the trade war.\n\nPercentage point reduction to 2020 GDP\n\nChina: 2.0\n\nThe United States: 0.6\n\nGlobal economy: 0.7\n\nThis is a good agreement for both sides. While the usual critics throw cold water as if this were the final deal, the fact is so many were okay with the status quo, but now they have declared themselves the arbiters of progress.\n\nYes, China needs food and our farmers need to sell products, so it\u2019s a natural fit that was always going to work in favor of the United States. However, don\u2019t think China doesn\u2019t hate giving up the angle that allows the Mainstream media to portray the administration negatively among farmers and sympathizers (which should be all Americans).\n\nBig Tech is in focus, which means the NASDAQ Composite will be in focus as well. On Friday, the index pierced through its 50-day moving average with conviction and now faces several technical hurdles.\n\nFirst test: 8,194\n\nSecond test: 8,330\n\nToday's Session\n\nLet's watch closely, as stocks are trying for fourth straight day of gains.", "description": "An artist's impression from The Illustrated London News of 9 .10/14/2019 19:19:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/305/76105473-2de5-44a2-b1d1-c1b10b6c6076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
