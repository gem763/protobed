It will get you nowhere with me\n\nRecently, when I returned from a beach holiday, a colleague said my skin looked nice.\n\n\u201cThank you, that\u2019s kind,\u201d I replied. \u201cThough I don\u2019t see it myself.\u201d\n\nShe pressed on, cheerily. \u201cYour face is glowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Maybe that\u2019s because I got rid of my moustache.\u201d\n\nWhat can I say? Along with many British people, I have developed a powerful forcefield for repelling compliments. Deflection (\u201cThis old thing?\u201d); rejection (\u201cI\u2019ve actually gained weight\u201d); even distraction (\u201cYou liked dinner? Try the wine\u201d).\n\nWe start early, with our families and then friends. We learn to brush off compliments, regarding them as biased. It\u2019s not right. Last year, I decided to express positive feelings, and put some happiness into the world. But these compliments often failed to penetrate the forcefield of others. They were returned to sender, often with an unintentional insult: an implication my judgment is poor, or my motives ulterior. Giving a compliment is one thing, but taking one may be tougher still.\n\nFrom cat videos to karaoke, I've decided to embrace silliness | Coco Khan Read more\n\nA few months ago, a man struck up a conversation in the gym. He wasn\u2019t my type but was mainstream-handsome, and notably polite. As he left, he gave me a piece of paper. \u201cNo pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here\u2019s my number.\u201d Readers, I dined out on that for months. A real-life meet-cute; the stuff of movies. Confidence boosted, I held my chin higher. No longer did I shuffle but strut.\n\nI never saw him again, but I did discover that he\u2019s a suspect in the investigation into the phantom shower defecator plaguing the gym. A hilarious ending to a movie Hollywood wouldn\u2019t make. Should I discount the compliment, after all the joy it brought? That would be a loss. Because a compliment given and received is only a win-win.", "description": "Along with many Britons, I have developed a powerful forcefield for repelling compliments", "authors": ["Coco Khan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30d2d67ec137c281f1b858947e6c748546926bc/1422_302_1887_1132/master/1887.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e42580ff916277e32e6b38b4266653dc", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
