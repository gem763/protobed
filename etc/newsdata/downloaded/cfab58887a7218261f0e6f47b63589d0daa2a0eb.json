So yeah, it\u2019s a very interesting phenomenon,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cSo we have a number of approaches that we\u2019re going to take towards this, and we have a product called Lasso that\u2019s a standalone app that we\u2019re working on, trying to get product-market fit in countries like Mexico, is I think one of the first initial ones.\u201d\n\nFacebook introduced its Lasso earlier this year in Mexico, as it is one of the few countries where TikTok is yet to establish a presence.\n\nZuckerberg said the aim is to test out the app in Mexico before rolling it out to a global audience.\n\n\u201cI think we have time to learn and understand and get ahead of the trend. It is growing, but they\u2019re spending a huge amount of money promoting it,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that their retention is actually not that strong after they stop advertising. So the space is still fairly nascent, and there\u2019s time for us to kind of figure out what we want to do here. But I think this is a real thing. It\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also addressed other challenges facing the company, including its controversial Libra cryptocurrency.\n\nHe explained why he refused to testify in some parts of the world to face questions from lawmakers and regulators about the new currency, saying: \"It just doesn't really make sense for me to go to hearings in every single country that wants to have me show up.\"", "description": "A leaked recording from an internal Facebook meeting has revealed CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2018s \u201cplan of attack\u201d when it comes to competing with its hugely popular Chinese rival TikTok.
