She has lost six stone in just over a year (right)\n\nMiss Casserly decided to join her local Slimming World in Lincolnshire and said she had never had the courage to do something about her weight before.\n\n'I was a big secret binge eater and spent years in complete denial about my weight issues.'I was unhappy and always had been, but never had the courage to do something about it.\n\n'I also found out that my beautiful younger sister was getting married and it instantly brought back memories of feeling self-conscious when I was bridesmaid for my best friend a few years earlier.\n\n'I didn't want to feel like that this time.'\n\nMiss Casserly had been a bridesmaid before (left and centre) and said she wanted to look good for her sister's wedding. She is pictured right as a bridesmaid after her weight loss\n\nShe joined in 2018 and has since lost six stone and has also dropped five dress sizes\n\nShe said: 'Like a lot of slimmers, I had tried to lose weight so many times before by following numerous diets but they were never sustainable because I'd always get tired of restricting what I ate.\n\n'I thought I was destined to struggle with my weight for the rest of my life, but when I came to Slimming World it was different. I never felt like I was on a diet.\n\nMiss Casserly (above) has praised her time at Slimming World for helping her lose weight and become more active\n\n'The eating plan encourages you to eat lots of tasty, filling foods like pasta, rice, potatoes and lean meat and fish.'\n\nShe added that she hasn't felt deprived on the plan and was glad to have found a way to lose weight without starving herself.\n\nHaving managed to control her food intake, Miss Casserly insists that it isn't just about the food you put in your mouth.\n\nAs well as becoming a mentor at Slimmer's World, she also sees a personal trainer once a week and regularly enjoys power lifting challenges.\n\nShe said: 'Slimming World isn't just about changing what you eat. Becoming more active is important too.\n\n'Our Body Magic programme takes the threat out of activity by showing people, many of whom have unpleasant memories of being forced to take part in activity at school, how they can build activity into their daily routine without having to take up traditional forms of exercise like going to the gym or running.\n\n'Everything counts from walking to gardening to washing the car.'\n\nMiss Casserly is now turning her attention to helping others change their lives for the better and has successfully completed the required training to become a consultant and run her own session in Lincoln.\n\nAfter losing six stone, Miss Casserly has now also become a Slimming World consultant\n\nShe said: 'Support is really the most important thing. It all starts with feeling that you're not alone.\n\n'I couldn't have lost six stone without the weekly help, encouragement and understanding of my own consultant and group.\n\n'As someone who has lost weight myself I know the challenges people can face, which is why, along with the group, I will be there to support every one of my members all the way to their chosen target weight.\n\n'Setting targets, sharing recipes and other ideas, and working together as a group to overcome challenges and celebrate success is so important to a successful journey.\n\n'That's why at my Slimming World group, there'll be tons of support, encouragement and fun.'\n\nKatie Cowie, who runs Slimming World's Wednesday Brant Road group and manages Bernice as a team developer, says: 'Slimming World consultants are chosen for their positive outlook and because they genuinely care about the health and happiness of others.\n\n'With Bernice's experience of being a successful Slimming World member and her kind and warm personality and great sense of humour I just know that she'll be an amazing support to members, cheering them all the way to their target weight.'", "description": "Bernice Casserly had always struggled with her weight but said the final straw for her had been last year when she was on a beach holiday.
