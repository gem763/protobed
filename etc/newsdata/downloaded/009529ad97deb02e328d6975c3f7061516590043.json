Life is short.\u201d Or, as Jim, 56, puts it: \u201cWe don\u2019t get up in the morning unless we want to get up. \u2026 It\u2019s a what-I-want-to-do life now.\u201d\n\nIndeed, life in Puerto Octay \u2014 a village in southern Chile brimming with traditional German-style architecture \u2014 often revolves around the breathtaking nature at your doorstep. Locals and visitors alike enjoy the beaches abutting the deep blue lake, as well as a variety of water sports like kayaking, fishing, sailing and swimming.\n\nThe Dorchaks had never considered Chile as a retirement option \u2014 and, for that matter, weren\u2019t considering retirement at age 50. But a series of tragedies hit their family, including the decimation of their real-estate business by the Great Recession: \u201cWe had this realization that life is short,\u201d says Jim, 56. \u201cOur dream had always been to have a little farm and raise our kids there.\u201d\n\nThe Dorchaks Lori and Jim Dorchak with one of their five kids.\n\nSo when some friends who had a vacation home in Chile invited them to stay there, the Dorchaks jumped at the chance. And what they found, they fell in love with: a stable government, low crime, breathtaking scenery, the ability to live on little money, and \u201cwonderful people who don\u2019t care if your Spanish is miserable,\u201d Jim says. \u201cThey will talk to you, anyway.\u201d (They also looked at Uruguay, but found the crime rate too high there, though Jim notes that the food is \u201cdelicious.\u201d)\n\nThey decided to retire to Chile in 2013 when three of their children were still school-aged (the children attended the free Catholic school in the area, and just the youngest lives with them now), and, to do that, they paid off all their U.S. debts, as well as bought a 6-acre property and a car in Chile and invested money to provide ongoing income, using their savings and an inheritance from Jim\u2019s father.\n\nThe cost of everyday life\n\nThe Dorchaks say that their monthly expenses typically range from about $2,000 to $3,000, though this can vary a lot. Some of their largest expenses are food, which costs them about $300 to $400 a month (they grow a lot of their own food and raise livestock on their land and can sometimes trade their produce and livestock with neighbors); supplies and hardware at about $300 a month; their phone and internet bill at about $100 a month (they save money on that by using WhatsApp and Skype, which is how we video chatted); and gas for their car, which costs them about $100 a month, as well as for their backup generator (though they try to use that sparingly). Other expenses include electricity, which ranges from about $50 to $150; propane for the cooking stove and hot water at about $75 a month; and firewood at about $75 a month.\n\nThey save a lot of money by using solar panels for power, traveling abroad infrequently (Lori hasn\u2019t been back to the U.S. in six years, and Jim has only gone back once in that time; when \u201cyou\u2019ve lived in paradise, you don\u2019t want to go anywhere else,\u201d Jim adds with a laugh). And they live frugally. \u201cWhen we moved here we just tried to simplify life, our needs are not a lot,\u201d says Jim. \u201cWe\u2019re off-the-grid homesteaders.\u201d\n\nThough the couple was fully retired when they first moved to Chile, they bring in a little income these days from a variety of projects and their investments. They sell their own barbecue sauce and some of their produce from the farm; they cater some events; they\u2019re getting into real estate again; and through their blogand YouTube channel they have a \u201cpay what you can\u201d donation option where they\u2019ll give advice to people thinking about retiring in Chile and rent out a cabana on their property if those people want to visit.\n\nWhat\u2019s your favorite thing about living in Chile?\n\n\u201cMost important is that the people here are wonderful and kind,\u201d says Jim. \u201cWe have Chilean friends who speak no English who come to dinner. \u2026 Everybody knows us here.\u201d They\u2019re welcoming to the Dorchaks even though the couple still struggle with Spanish. \u201cWe thought we would learn really easily, but with our 50-year-old brains that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Jim jokes \u2014 though they now speak functional Spanish. And they\u2019re learning more all the time: Three of their sons who attended school in Chile are fluent in Spanish; and one of their sons is married to a Chilean.\n\nWhat do you miss most about the United States?\n\n\u201cThe availability of shopping and goods. We have the basics here, but the U.S. has a better selection of products,\u201d Jim notes \u2014 adding that he\u2019d love to be able to hit up a good Thai restaurant. For her part, Lori says: \u201cI miss the craft store.\u201d And Jim says that banking \u201cis the worst thing about living here\u201d (you can read all about the difficulties of that here).\n\nWas it hard to get residency?\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of paperwork,\u201d says Jim \u2014 but he notes that even so the couple did most of the work to become residents and homeowners themselves, though \u201cmost people get a lawyer in Santiago and pay a lot for it.\u201d This website gives a good overview of how to get Chilean residency.\n\nHow\u2019s the health care?\n\nChile is known to have a solid health-care system: A report from the World Health Organization ranked its system highly \u2014 33rd out of the 191 nations it looked at. The Dorchaks use the national health-care system. (You can see health care details and costs for expats here). Both say that the quality of the care is good and the cost affordable. Jim \u2014 who recently needed multiple MRIs (some building supplies fell off his truck and knocked him out) \u2014 says his bills for those were under $300.\n\nBottom line\n\n\u201cChile is not right for everyone; it is not perfect,\u201d Lori observes \u2014 but, for the Dorchaks, it\u2019s just what their family needed. \u201cWe are so happy out here on our own. It is beautiful, and we don\u2019t want to go anywhere else.\u201d", "description": "Jim and Lori Dorchak left the U.S. about six years ago.
