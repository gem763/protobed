He was probably hoping for a warm welcome at the UN where he could complain about US intervention to a sympathetic European audience.\n\nBut today the ground shifted under Rouhani\u2019s feet. President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of the UK released a joint statement today stating \u201cit is clear to us that Iran bears responsibility for the attack\u201d on Saudi Arabian oil production. The statement continues, \u201cThere is no other plausible explanation.\u201d Here\u2019s the full statement:\n\nThis represents a win for the Trump administration which said almost immediately that Iran was responsible for the attack. Vox points out the significance of the joint statement:\n\nThis is significant. Ever since the US withdrew from the nuclear agreement last year, the European countries who are party to the agreement \u2014 which include the nations from the statement \u2014 have tried to maintain good relations with Tehran. French President Emmanuel Macron in particular has worked tirelessly to keep the accord alive and even tried to broker a meeting between President Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani, at the UN this week. But it seems they cannot ignore the intelligence they have, and decided to openly condemn the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe NY Times notes that even John Kerry doesn\u2019t buy Iran\u2019s denials:\n\nThey are denying any Iranian involvement in the destruction of two major Saudi oil facilities, an assertion that even former Secretary of State John Kerry, who negotiated the nuclear accord four years ago and has become its biggest defender, finds far-fetched. Iran, he said, was behind the attack \u201cone way or the other.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s still a bit of a cop-out on Kerry\u2019s part. The evidence shows that the drones and missiles used in the attack were Iranian in design and were launched from Iran. There\u2019s no other way to view this. Still, it\u2019s something that even Kerry isn\u2019t leaping to Iran\u2019s defense this time.\n\nLast week, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif threatened \u201call-out war\u201d if Iran were attacked in reprisal for the strike on Saudi Arabia. But Trump and Saudi Arabia have options other than a military strike. In fact, Trump hinted that things are taking place now which haven\u2019t been revealed yet:\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of pressure on them right now \u2014 more pressure than they\u2019ve ever had. \u2026 A lot of things are happening with respect to Iran. A lot more than you would know. A lot more than the media knows, OK? I\u2019ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow,\u201d he said, one day before his address to the U.N. General Assembly\u2026 During the General Assembly, the Trump administration intends to bring the focus on Iran after blaming it for the massive Saudi attack, according to a senior State Department official, but they added that the U.S. is really looking for the Saudis to take the lead and present evidence to the U.N. to rally international support for them after they suffered this attack. \u201cNow it\u2019s up to the international community and really up to Saudi Arabia for what they\u2019re going to say this week, what they\u2019re going to present to the U.N. because it was the Saudis that were attacked and had almost 60% of their oil supply taken off the market,\u201d the official said.\n\nSo we\u2019ll probably have a clearer picture of what is happening tomorrow but it looks like the world is finally lining up against Iran after this latest attack.", "description": "\"There is no other plausible explanation.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Macron-Merkel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
