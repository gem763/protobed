JD.com (JD.O) fell 5.95% to $27.82 and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O) declined 3.67% to $101.21. The iShares China Large-Cap ETF shed (FXI.P) 1.15%.\n\nIndex providers, which have ratcheted up their exposure to Chinese shares in recent years, also lost ground, with MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) dropping 3.43 to $215.89 and S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N) down 3.77% to $246.35.\n\nShares of New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) ended down 1.88% at $92.40 and shares of Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) declined 1.70% to $100.08.\n\n\u201cOne critical quality of our capital markets is that we provide non-discriminatory and fair access to all eligible companies,\u201d said Nasdaq spokesman Allan Schoenberg. \u201cThe statutory obligation of all U.S. equity exchanges to do so creates a vibrant market that provides diverse investment opportunities for U.S. investors.\u201d\n\nNYSE declined to comment, as did S&P Global and London Stock Exchange-owned FTSE Russell (LSE.L). MSCI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe share price declines were likely the result of knee-jerk reactions by retail investors, rather than institutional investors expecting any imminent changes, said an executive at a U.S. exchange.\n\nIt was unclear what mechanisms the U.S. government could use to achieve its goals, several sources said.\n\nDelistings from U.S. exchanges could potentially be achieved through U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission reviews, or through SEC rule-making tied to protecting American investors, the sources said.\n\nOther actions, like prohibiting pension investments in index funds that include Chinese stocks could require U.S. President Donald Trump to declare a national emergency and invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration also may be able to work with Congress on legislation to limit such investments, one of the sources said.\n\nTensions around Chinese listings on U.S. exchanges have been building since 2011 when scores of Chinese companies trading in the United States were accused on accounting irregularities.\n\nIn June, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill to force Chinese companies listed on American stock exchanges to submit to regulatory oversight, including providing access to audits or face delisting.\n\nLast year the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a warning to investors about the difficulties U.S. regulators faced in inspecting the audit work and practices of auditing firms in China that examine U.S.-listed Chinese companies.", "description": "Shares of Chinese stocks traded in the United States, along with indexing companies, slumped on Friday after reports the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese firms from U.S. stock exchanges and limiting U.S. investment in China-based securities.", "authors": ["Chuck Mikolajczak", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
