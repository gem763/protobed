A January 2019 federal grand jury indictment against Li said she used 20 apartments in Irvine to house pregnant clients.\n\n\u201cYou Win\u201d advertised that it had served more than 500 Chinese \u201cbirth tourism\u201d customers, according to the indictment.\n\nThe company coached some customers to lie on visa applications and to U.S. immigration officials, according to Li\u2019s plea agreement, which added that the women also learned how to trick U.S. Customs at ports of entry by hiding their pregnancies.\n\nCHINA BANS FLYING PIGEONS, DRONES AS BEIJING PREPS FOR 70TH ANNIVERSARY MILITARY PARADE\n\nFederal prosecutors said Li admitted clients were coached on how to pass U.S. consulate interviews in China as well, including by stating falsely that they were going to stay in the U.S. for only two weeks, when they really had planned to stay for up to three months to give birth.\n\nThis past January, federal officials charged 19 people, including Li, in the first crackdown on birth tourism businesses. Li was the first of the charged operators of birth tourism businesses to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said, adding that the rest either awaited trial or were fugitives.\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t been illegal to visit the United States while pregnant, investigators said the businesses \u2014 which federal agents raided in 2015 \u2014 touted the benefits of having U.S.-citizen babies who could get free public education and, years later, help their parents immigrate.\n\nAs part of her plea agreement, Li agreed to forfeit over $850,000, a southern California home worth over $500,000 and several Mercedes-Benz vehicles, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nLi\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLi could face 15 years in federal prison; sentencing has been scheduled for December.\n\nFox News\u2019 Frank Miles and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A woman who ran a California \u201cbirth tourism\u201d business that charged Chinese clients tens of thousands of dollars to help them give birth in the United States has pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges, The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office announced on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
