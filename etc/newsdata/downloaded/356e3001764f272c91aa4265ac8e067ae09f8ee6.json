What is unacceptable is the phenomenon of resolving conflict through the barrel of a gun.\n\n\"Protests are welcome but the destruction of infrastructure or economic sabotage is intolerable,\" said Mbalula.\n\nHe described the meeting as a watershed, adding it would lead to broader discussions going forward, where the future of the taxi industry and integrated transport system would be addressed.\n\n\"We must begin to talk to each other and not past each other. The taxi industry is growing and as it grows so does its challenges. We will not resolve conflict by killing each other. We call on officials to urgently compile an agreement that will assist in maintaining peace,\" he said.\n\nMbalula also pledged to return to the Eastern Cape to assess progress made in the peace process.", "description": "Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula, who was addressing various taxi associations in the province, called for tolerance and unity among operators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9420/0ee8219051d9423eb371dd5d1ca8893b.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
