He became paralysed from the shoulders down.\n\nDoctors who conducted the trial cautioned that the device is years away from being publicly available but stressed that it had \"the potential to improve patients' quality of life and autonomy\".", "description": "The technology represents a scientific breakthrough that could bring hope to tetraplegics seeking to regain movement.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/75/20/1000x563_cmsv2_ac8a03bc-cbe5-525b-9ffa-9f888e447326-4207520.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
