So what now? For freshers starting a new chapter at university, deciding how to live your life is vital. Here are some ideas for how you can be sustainable as a student.\n\n'The youth generation is united': the uni students striking for the climate Read more\n\nEating\n\nWhat you put on your plate matters: nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gases come from agriculture, and most of those are from meat and dairy. Cutting out meat (if you\u2019re able to) is an easy way to reduce your carbon footprint, and you\u2019ll save money too.\n\nA meat-free diet has been recommended as the \u201csingle-biggest way\u201d an individual can reduce their impact on the planet. Meat and dairy consumption result in excessive land use, industrial emissions, methane, water use and deforestation.\n\nUniversities are now reacting to this: Goldsmiths has scrapped the sale of all beef products from its campus as it seeks to become carbon neutral by 2025. \u201cThe growing global call for organisations to take seriously their responsibilities for halting climate change is impossible to ignore,\u201d the university\u2019s warden, Frances Corner, said.\n\nThis year scientists devised a planetary health diet, presenting a way to address the environmental (and health) impact of our food choices. It recommends the global average consumption of red meat should be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts should double.\n\nWhatever you choose to eat, try to shop locally and seasonally. You\u2019ll most likely avoid the plastic packaging you find in supermarkets, and these products will have a lower carbon footprint. If you have the space \u2013 even just a windowsill will do \u2013 try growing some of your own herbs or vegetables; it\u2019s amazing what you can get from just a window box planter. You can also reduce food waste by planning meals in advance, eating leftovers and sharing meals with friends.\n\nDressing\n\nForget fast fashion: keeping your clothes for as long as possible has much more than just monetary value. In the UK, clothing has the fourth-largest environmental impact after housing, transport and food. We throw away more than half of our fast-fashion items within less than a year.\n\nSo recycle your clothes, mend them, or accessorise them. If you don\u2019t have those skills see if there\u2019s a sewing society you could join, or head to a repair cafe where people mend clothes for free. Try clothes swaps with friends, and instead of buying new items head to a charity or second-hand shop.\n\nIf you want to buy new clothes, says Ynes Patat, a fashion student at the University of Northampton, \u201clook at brands that appeal to your style but research to see if they do have sustainable qualities, like Patagonia or Pact (they prize themselves on being organic, GOTS-certified, fair trade and eco-friendly). Even some high street stores are turning to more sustainable fashion.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest There are simple ways to change household habits and live more sustainably.

There are simple ways you can change your habits to live more sustainably. Wash your clothes at a lower temperature, and opt for a bamboo toothbrush or more eco-friendly sanitary products. Invest in a clothes horse so you stop using a tumble drier (you\u2019ll be surprised how much your energy bill goes down). When shopping, see if there\u2019s a zero-waste shop nearby \u2013 Sheffield students\u2019 union has opened a store selling dried food, household products, toiletries and kitchenware all free from plastic packaging. Just turn up with your own container.\n\n'I love calling out politicians': meet the student suing Trump over climate change Read more\n\nOf course, the easiest way to make a difference is to cut out flying. A return trip from Manchester to Berlin produces about 214 kg of CO2; there are 15 countries where the average person produces less CO2 in a year. If you\u2019re planning a weekend away with new friends, try and travel by train or bus instead.\n\nCampaigning\n\nIndividual actions matter, as they demonstrate commitment and provide an alternative to how we can live. But campaigning and activism are important too. University campuses can be the perfect place for this: 91% of students are now concerned about climate change, according to a survey from the NUS. If you don\u2019t know where or how to start, see if there are any societies at your university like Extinction Rebellion or UK Student Climate Network. Look at People and Planet\u2019s university league \u2013 where does your university rank and what needs to change? Students of the fossil free campaign, for example, have brought on huge changes by calling on their institutions to divest from fossil fuels \u2013 and 76 UK universities have now committed to divest.", "description": "From cutting out beef to repairing old clothes, here are some tips for freshers who want to be green at university", "authors": ["Naomi Larsson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77a3e80682d475f792c650d6effaa0abd91318b/0_14_5477_3288/master/5477.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0317bc48bbe98c73f1a3a317829aba39", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
