But his childish attention seeking could prove fatal for innocent bystander Harlow (Jemma Donovan).\n\nHendrix has proven a pain in his dad\u2019s neck since he arrived in town, testing Pierce\u2019s parenting skills to the limit. Hendrix is managing to run rings around him as he\u2019s so out of practice at playing Dad. But his bad boy actions could have huge consequences for Harlow.\n\nSusan (Jackie Woodburne) realises Pierce isn\u2019t coping with the pressures of fatherhood and arranges a favour with Toadie (Ryan Moloney). Pierce pops over to the Rebecchi house to discuss some business but he\u2019s shocked when Gary (Damien Richardson) arrives with pies and the two men ask him to hang out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPierce is embarrassed when he thinks that Susan has told them he\u2019s a bad dad, but he soon realises that they just want to talk to him because they used to be the Hendrix\u2019s of their families, and yet they eventually turned out to be good. As he listens to how to deal with his own bad lad son, Pierce thinks he\u2019s hit on a breakthrough.\n\nBut he\u2019s counting his chickens before they\u2019ve hatched. After the chat, Pierce wants to put things into practice and takes Hendrix to the Waterhole cellar to show him the wine he produces \u2013 revealing that his son will one day inherit his business. Hendrix is thrown, he never imagined his dad would have faith in him, and they begin to bond.\n\nHendrix\u2019s bad behaviour endangers Harlow (Picture: Channel 5)\n\nBut when Hendrix finds himself ditched by Pierce when Chloe calls, he turns resentful and his reaction proves dangerous. He lashes out by stealing his dad\u2019s car for a joy ride. He\u2019s angry and not thinking straight, most definitely shouldn\u2019t be behind the wheel. He quickly loses control and careens through a Lassiters\u2019 event full of people, crashing through a marquee and knocking it down.\n\nBut he\u2019s not just caused a load of damage \u2013 Roxy is horrified to discover Harlow is trapped underneath. Has his knee-jerk reaction left Harlow badly injured, or even worse?!\n\nScenes air from Monday 14th October at 1.45pm and 5.30pm on Channel 5.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Hendrix's decision to joy ride has dire consequences.", "authors": ["Katie Baillie"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Harlow-Neighbours-e29b_1570190127.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
