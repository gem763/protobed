It also would:\n\nEnd dividend recaps and most company-derived fees for at least the first two years after a buyout.\n\nMake funds liable for pension obligations.\n\nMake general partners individually liable for certain obligations.\n\nIncrease disclosure to limited partners. (note: LPs are excluded from the above liabilities.)\n\nRework bankruptcy rules in a way that favors many parties over private equity, despite the debt liability.\n\nChange the tax treatment of carried interest, and limit interest deductibility.\n\nHer intention may be to put more of the equity back in private equity, thus forcing firms to make more responsible investment decisions, but the increased risk profiles and competitive disadvantages would stop many firms in their tracks \u2014 and likely end the turnaround industry.\n\nThere could be industry workarounds for Warren to contend with. Such as heavily-structured joint ventures with lenders or PE firms eschewing blind pool funds in favor of special-purpose vehicles.\n\nPrivate equity is obviously crying foul. Sources argue that Warren's rationale \u2014 detailed in a Medium post \u2014 is cherry-picked; focused on a pair of industries (physical retail and local news) that were self-immolating regardless of private equity's involvement. They also decry how Warren overlooked the role private equity returns play in pension returns, particularly if/when public equities turn south, suggesting her bill would rob Pension Peter to pay Retail Cashier Paul.\n\nThey have a point. Relatively few PE-backed companies go bankrupt, let alone liquidate, and few firms still participate in the sectors she cites.\n\nThey also need to buy a better mirror. Private equity's ongoing refusal to abandon such parasitic practices as dividend recaps and monitoring fees has created the environment for Warren's rhetoric to be warmly received in some quarters. And I'm not ashamed to say I told you so. Seven years ago.\n\nThe bottom line: On Monday, Peter Thiel said that Warren was the Democratic candidate who scared him most. Now he's got a lot of private equity company.", "description": "Private equity is obviously crying foul.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/WAR8u4SBEySOf3W31zzdAOlq24A=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/07/19/1563548683673.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-19"}
