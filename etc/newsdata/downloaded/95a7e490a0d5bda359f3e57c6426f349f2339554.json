On June 28 of this year, the Pentagon said it was ready to provide the funds.\n\nThe aid, however, was mysteriously withheld by the White House for months, prompting Republicans and Democrats alike to publicly and privately express their concerns over the delay. Amid the mounting bipartisan pressure, the White House finally lifted its hold over the funds on September 11.\n\nBut the release of a White House memorandum of a July call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later in September prompted House Democrats to launch the impeachment inquiry, in part to probe whether the president used the military aid as leverage in his efforts to pressure the Ukrainian leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nIn its subpoena, the House Intelligence Committee asked Esper to turn over the documents by this Tuesday.", "description": "\"We will do everything we can to cooperate with the Congress,\" Mark Esper told \"Face the Nation\" Sunday", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/13/7adf55cb-2db2-4ea7-ae4e-edba80bd5f49/thumbnail/1200x630/4a8195bf7d754c48974b8d88f6b08b29/20191013-ftn-cr1-esper-pretape-frame-20762.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
