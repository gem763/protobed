(May 21) AP, AP\n\nElton John isn't holding back.\n\nIn his irreverent and achingly personal new memoir \"Me,\" released Tuesday, the legendary rock star gets candid about his tumultuous childhood, past relationships and years-long struggles with alcoholism, drug addiction and his sexuality, before coming out as gay and getting sober nearly three decades ago.\n\nMore: 'Rocketman' Taron Egerton shoots for the moon playing Elton John in bold new musical\n\nIt's an engrossing read for any longtime fan of John, 72, whose life and career was explored earlier this year in big-screen biopic \"Rocketman,\" starring Taron Egerton as the Grammy-winning hit-maker. Far more so than the movie, the roughly 400-page \"Me\" is chock full of dishy celebrity anecdotes as John recounts funny and sometimes sad stories about his famous friends, collaborators and acquaintances.\n\nHere are some of the most surprising things we learned:\n\nElton John's new autobiography \"Me\" is out this week.

Whitby, Getty Images for EJAF)\n\nMichael Jackson was 'disturbing' to be around during lunch at Elton John's house\n\nNot long after getting sober, John began a sweet courtship with now-husband David Furnish, whom he was introduced to in 1993 and dated in secret for the first few months of their relationship. John soon decided to throw a lunch to introduce Furnish to his mother and friends \u2013 among them a psychiatrist, who brought along none other than Michael Jackson as a last-minute guest.\n\nJohn had known the now-late pop star since he was a teenager, \"but at some point in the intervening years, he started sequestering himself from the world,\" John writes. \"God knows what prescription drugs he was being pumped full of, but every time I saw him in his later years I came away thinking the poor guy had totally lost his marbles. I don't mean that in a light-hearted way. He was genuinely mentally ill, a disturbing person to be around.\"\n\nMichael Jackson, who died in 2009, pictured in 1996. (Photo: Vincent Amalvy/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nJohn continues that the ensuing lunch with Jackson was \"even stranger\" than he anticipated: They had to sit indoors with curtains drawn because of Jackson's vitiligo, a skin condition, and the \"Thriller\" singer refused to eat. He eventually wandered away from the table and was found hours later playing video games with the housekeeper's 11-year-old son.\n\n\"The poor guy looked awful, really frail and ill,\" John recalls. \"He was wearing makeup that looked like it had been applied by a maniac ... (and) his nose was covered with a sticking plaster which kept what was left of it attached to his face.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Jackson's estate for comment.\n\nFreddie Mercury was 'completely outrageous' until his death, got John a cheeky Christmas gift\n\nJohn shares some heartbreaking anecdotes about the since-deceased pop culture icons he met throughout his life, including Elvis Presley, who was \"overweight,\" \"sluggish,\" \"completely gone\" and \"barely coherent\" when they were introduced backstage at a show; and Princess Diana, whose approachability and magnetism reduced Hollywood stars to \"love-struck teenage idiots.\" (John has long-refused to play the 1997 version of \"Candle in the Wind\" that was re-written and re-recorded for Diana's funeral, calling the public's obsession with it \"morbid and unnatural.\")\n\nFreddie Mercury of Queen performing at Live Aid in London in 1985. (Photo: Georges De Keerle Hulton, Getty Images)\n\nBut one of the book's most devastating passages is about John's friend Freddie Mercury, who died of AIDS-related complications in 1991.\n\n\"He hadn't told me he was ill \u2013 I'd just found out through mutual friends,\" John writes. \"I visited him a lot when he was dying, although I could never stay for much longer than an hour. It was too upsetting.\"\n\nBut the charismatic Queen frontman remained in good spirits: In the weeks leading up to his death that November, \"he was too frail to get out of bed, he was losing his sight, his body was covered in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, and yet he was still definitely Freddie, gossiping away, completely outrageous.\"\n\nAfter he died, John received a Christmas gift that Mercury had bought him: a watercolor by the artist Henry Scott Tuke, who painted male nudes, which the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" singer attached a cheeky note to saying, \"Thought you'd love this.\" \"Like I said before: Freddie was magnificent,\" John writes.\n\nTina Turner at a concert in 2008. (Photo: Orlin Wagner/AP)\n\nTina Turner called him 'fat,' was a nightmare to work with\n\nOne of \"Me's\" less-flattering passages is reserved for Tina Turner. In 1997, the two artists discussed a joint tour \"that quickly turned into a disaster,\" John writes. During the planning stages, he says she called him at home \"with the express intention of telling me how awful I was and how I had to change before we could work together.\"\n\n\"She didn't like my hair, she didn't like the color of my piano \u2013 which for some reason had to be white \u2013 and she didn't like my clothes,\" John says. \" 'You wear too much Versace, and it makes you look fat \u2013 you need to wear Armani,' she announced.\"\n\nMore: Elton John kicks off final tour with powerhouse three-hour show\n\nTensions rose when they started rehearsals for a joint performance for VH1 Divas Live, where John's band told him they refused to tour with her and called her a \"(expletive) nightmare.\" John says she continually scolded him and his bandmates for \"not playing ('Proud Mary') right,\" until he finally had enough and told Turner \"to stick her tongue up her (expletive)\" before storming off.\n\nThe tour was eventually scrapped, and John went on the road with his friend Billy Joel instead.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Turner for comment.\n\nJohn Lennon, left, and Yoko Ono were longtime friends of Elton John. (Photo: Barrie Wentzell via Lionsgat)\n\nYoko Ono asked him to record unreleased John Lennon songs, but he refused\n\nJohn was first introduced to John Lennon in the early '70s when Lennon and then-wife Yoko Ono were estranged. The two became fast friends and partied regularly with fellow Beatles member Ringo Starr. (One memorable evening, John writes, they refused to answer the door for artist Andy Warhol because they didn't want to be photographed with \"icicles of cocaine\" hanging from their noses.)\n\nJohn says he was shaken by Lennon's murder in 1980: \"I really loved John, and when you love someone that much, I don't think you ever quite get over their death.\"\n\nHe goes on to say that he received a call from Ono a couple years later asking to meet. When he arrived in New York, \"she told me she'd found a load of tapes with unfinished songs John had been working on before he died,\" John writes. \"She asked me if I would complete them, so they could be released. It was very flattering, but I absolutely didn't want to. I thought it was too soon.\"\n\nJohn never did record the songs, saying it would've been \"presumptuous\" putting his voice on the same records as Lennon's. \"I thought it was horrible,\" he adds. \"Yoko was insistent, but so was I.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Ono for comment.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2019/10/16/elton-john-me-michael-jackson-tina-turner-freddie-mercury/3995271002/", "description": "In his candid new autobiography \"Me,\" Elton John opens up about his friendships with Freddie Mercury and John Lennon, and past tiff with Tina Turner.", "authors": ["Patrick Ryan", "John Sandford", "Rachel Maddow", "Delia Owens", "Stephen King", "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "Published A.M.
