The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella militia mostly comprised of Kurdish fighters, accused Turkey of attempted \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d against the Kurdish population.\n\nTurkey coordinated the attack with the Free Syrian Army (FSA), a coalition of mostly Arab fighters, including jihadist elements, organized and supported by former President Barack Obama. The SDF has accused the FSA of war crimes; Kurdish news outlets have published videos of FSA jihadists desecrating Kurdish corpses while shouting \u201cAllahu akbar,\u201d a jihadist battle cry.\n\nKarag\u00fcl \u2013 whose newspaper parrots talking points from the Erdogan administration and who personally attended Erdogan\u2019s inauguration \u2013 regularly writes articles claiming that Saudi Arabia and Israel both operate as puppets for the United States and that a coalition including those three nations, the entirety of the European Union, and the United Arab Emirates are executing a conspiracy to keep the Turkish state weak. In his column Thursday, Karag\u00fcl suggested that the SDF and Kurdish forces generally are part of the Israeli-Saudi-European-American conspiracy against Turkey, so a ceasefire that results in the SDF withdrawing from the Syrian-Turkish border hurts all countries involved and precedes the rise of a new Ottoman empire.\n\nKarag\u00fcl\u2019s column is titled \u201cThree great interventions in three weeks\u2026 The Israeli, EU, and Arab regimes are stunned. The terror zone and their map project are history now! Erdo\u011fan, Putin, Trump\u2026 These three leaders are changing the world\u2026 The world is watching Turkey\u2019s comeback. This is Turkey\u2019s ascent!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. and European countries can no longer treat Turkey like a regional country. They cannot make plans without Turkey or ignore Turkey\u2019s power,\u201d Karag\u00fcl wrote. \u201cIn this sense, in global politics, Ankara now has greater weight than the entirety of EU countries.\u201d\n\nThe invasion and ceasefire prove Turkey is \u201ca third big power beside two big states such as the U.S. and Russia,\u201d he claimed.\n\n\u201cTurkey got the U.S. to withdraw from the safe zone,\u201d Karag\u00fcl added, without providing the context that President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to withdraw American troops from the Middle East. \u201cNo other force could ever get it to do so. But it had no choice other than to retreat. With the U.S. no longer there, the PKK, EU countries, as well as Israel, will all have to withdraw.\u201d\n\nThe Erdogan government contends that the SDF and its Kurdish forces are indistinguishable from the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a U.S.-designated Marxist terrorist group. The SDF are a U.S. ally and played a key role in the defeat of the Islamic State in Syria, which in turn was emboldened by Erdogan\u2019s refusal to police the border between the two countries, allowing foreign Islamic State sympathizers to invade Syria.\n\nKarag\u00fcl then decrees that the biggest loser of the ceasefire is Israel.\n\n\u201cIsrael in particular was disappointed in Syria. All its efforts since the very beginning of the war have gone down the drain. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which provided funds to the policies designed by Israel, lost in Syria. They are going to continue to lose,\u201d he wrote.\n\nKarag\u00fcl accuses Israel of most geopolitical developments he disapproves of. Karag\u00fcl claimed that Israel killed former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, who died in prison in Cairo and has called the crown prince of UAE a member of Israeli intelligence. He has further referred to Saudi Arabia and the UAE as \u201chitmen of the Crusaders [America, although the United States did not exist during the Crusades]\u201d and predicted a world war if Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman remains in power.\n\nKarag\u00fcl concluded that Erdogan\u2019s \u201cpowerful leadership and determination\u201d has \u201cput Turkey in the giants\u2019 league\u201d through brute force and that Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Trump \u201care changing the world.\u201d\n\nKarag\u00fcl was on hand for talks between Erdogan and Putin Tuesday that resulted in the current ceasefire.\n\n\u00c7ok bekledik\u2026 Bu i\u015f bu aksam\n\nbitecek insallah.. pic.twitter.com/rE7Ot1tzVr \u2014 \u0130brahim Karag\u00fcl (@ibrahimkaragul) October 22, 2019\n\nPutin and Erdogan announced a deal that would end active hostilities so long as the SDF withdrew from Kurdish territory. The Kremlin warned Kurdish forces that they would be \u201crun over by the Turkish military machine\u201d if they did not give up the areas they controlled to Russian soldiers. Russia has secured key Kurdish cities like Manbij and Kobani \u2013 where Kurdish forces fought a months-long battle to keep ISIS out \u2013 in exchange for Turkey promising not to attack.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov also took the opportunity to insult the United States, as the Kremlin often does regardless of the topic at hand: \u201cThe United States has been the Kurds\u2019 closest ally in recent years. In the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them. Now they prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks.\u201d\n\nThe agreement does not specifically address the issue of the 4 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, which Erdogan used as a pretext for \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d The objective of the operation, he claimed, was to resettle as many of these refugees as possible in a \u201csafe zone\u201d made up of Kurdish territory.\n\nIt also does not specify if the Free Syrian Army will stop its assault on the Kurds. Syrian Kurdish leaders have objected to jihadist FSA fighters targeting Kurdish civilians and terrorizing communities, calling the force \u201cthe new ISIS.\u201d\n\nGeneral Mazloum Abdi, the general commander of the SDF, accused the Turkish military of violating the ceasefire in a newly established Twitter account on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn spite of the Turks\u2019 announcement of the end of military operations, they and their jihadists, the so-called National Army, continue to violate and launch attacks on the eastern front of the Srikane region (Ras al-Ain),\u201d Abdi wrote. \u201cThe guarantors of the ceasefire must carry out their responsibilities to rein in the Turks and stop their operations.\u201d\n\nTurkish state media has confirmed the continued presence of troops in the region, but claimed they are handing out free bread to civilians.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The editor-in-chief of a pro-Erdogan Turkish newspaper declared \"the international system has collapsed\" in a column Thursday.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/turkish-forces-in-syria-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
