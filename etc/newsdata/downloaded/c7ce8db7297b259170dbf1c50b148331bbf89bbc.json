Bernie Sanders\u2019s (I-VT) Saturday rally in Queens, New York City.\n\nCruz told attendees:\n\n3000 Puerto Ricans did not open their eyes this morning because of a president who was too concerned about looking good, rather than doing good. We are not going to spend too much time talking about a racist, demagogue, xenophobic, paper-throwing, president.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s mention of President Trump prompted many Sanders supporters to chant \u201cLock Him Up\u201d \u2014 a play on the \u201cLock Her Up\u201d slogan synonymous with failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s vote him out,\u201d Cruz responded to attendees, before leading a \u201cVote Him Out\u201d chant.\n\nCruz has repeatedly criticized President Trump\u2019s response to Hurricane Maria, which killed 3,057 people across the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in September 2017. Yet, it is Cruz and other members of her administration that are under investigation by the FBI for allegedly keeping supplies from reaching the victims.\n\nThe \u201cBernie\u2019s Back \u201crally marked the Sanders campaign\u2019s first rally since the 78-year-old suffered a heart attack two weeks ago.\n\nStorming past questions about his health, Sanders vowed that he\u2019s \u201cmore ready than ever\u201d to fight for a political revolution \u2014 with a little help from new friends \u2014 at his rally that drew thousands to a New York City park. The rally offered a pointed reminder to skeptics in both political parties that the democratic socialist is still very much a force in the presidential race.\n\nSanders opened his remarks by apologizing that he secured a permit for only 20,000 people. His campaign, he said, was forced to close the gates on many more people who were trying to enter the Queens park just across the river from Manhattan.\n\n\u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back,\u201d Sanders declared, sparking chants of, \u201cBernie is back\u201d from the massive crowd.\n\n\u201cI am happy to report to you that I am more than ready \u2014 more ready than ever \u2014 to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today,\u201d he added. \u201cI am more than ready to assume the office of president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe event marked Sanders\u2019 formal return to the campaign trail less than three weeks after he suffered a heart attack that threatened both his life and political future. Even before that, he was in danger of falling out of the top-tier in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Polls suggest he\u2019s lagging behind liberal rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and establishment favorite former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Chants of \"lock him up\" broke out at 2020 White House contender Sen.
