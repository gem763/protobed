If someone acted improperly, illegally, if there was corruption, we will condemn it,\u201d he said.\n\nWith homicides on track to hit an all-time high this year and following the bungled arrest and release last week of Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, son of drug boss \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s approach to security has come under increasing scrutiny.\n\nOvidio was freed on 17 October after Sinaloa cartel gunmen overwhelmed security forcing his release and prompting a public outcry.\n\nOn Friday L\u00f3pez Obrador said police were under-trained and had been ineffective in putting together case files, and gathering all the evidence needed to keep suspected criminals behind bars.\n\n\u201cThe case files are wrongly put together and this lets judges say: \u2018This is wrong, there isn\u2019t enough evidence, there are contradictions,\u2019 and then they go free,\u201d he said.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding the release of the 27 suspects believed to belong to the Tepito Union cartel, including the identity of the judge who handled their case and when they were allowed to walk free, were not immediately known.\n\nA judicial reform, approved by Congress in 2008 and implemented in 2016 under the administration of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s predecessor, requires police to present more evidence for arrests.\n\nThe reform sought to modernise the judicial system by ending closed-doors trials and implementing public proceedings where prosecutors and defenders present evidence.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador said security officials need to be \u201cbetter trained\u201d and that judges must be \u201chonest, incorruptible\u201d.", "description": "Judge frees suspects arrested after seizure of drugs, money and rocket launchers in Mexico City", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29b4886825d27f64c123fef17d0862c17ee44f6c/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=409f6ab17258650c3042ae37983317d3", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
