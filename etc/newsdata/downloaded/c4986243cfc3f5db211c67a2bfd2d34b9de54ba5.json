Rather, the complaints came from U.K. residents \u201cwho understood that Deliveroo did not deliver to their areas\u201d and considered the ad misleading.\n\nRoofoods, the parent company of Deliveroo, argued that its on-screen message (\u201csome restrictions apply, obviously\u201d) should have made it clear that not all locations in the U.K. were covered, but the ASA ruled that the \u201cabsolute nature\u201d of the ad\u2019s claim \u201csuggested delivery was unrestricted throughout the U.K.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe considered the very clearly fantastical nature of the settings \u2013 for example, in space and a car chase \u2013 was likely to lead viewers to interpret the qualification to mean that the restrictions applied to places where it would be ridiculous to expect to be able to access the service, rather than that there were certain areas of the country that were excluded,\u201d the ASA wrote.\n\nAs per the ASA, Deliveroo can no longer show the ad \u201cin the form complained of,\u201d although the ad appears to still be live on its YouTube channel. (It\u2019s unclear if it has been modified from its original form.)\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA spokesperson for Deliveroo was not immediately available to comment, but the company did respond to the ruling in a statement shared with the BBC.\n\n\"Deliveroo designed a playful advert to show that, through our service, people are able to order food to a wide range of places, whether home or work, for a range of occasions,\u201d the statement read. \"We know some will be disappointed that their local area isn't currently served by Deliveroo, but we are expanding rapidly across the UK.\"", "description": "The ad, from Deliveroo, showed an astronaut receiving his order on the moon, and an escaped convict getting pizza delivered after tunneling free from prison.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/DeliverooDriverIstock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
