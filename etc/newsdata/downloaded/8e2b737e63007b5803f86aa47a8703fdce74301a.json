I know DC cops a lot of shit from people, but this genuinely looks fun as hell.\n\nDirected by Cathy Yan, the Suicide Squad spin-off picks up as Harley Quinn (absolute superstar Margot Robbie) splits from her toxic beau Joker, and links up with Black Canary (Jurnee Smollett-Bell), Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and Renee Montoya (Rosie Perez) to save a young girl from an evil crime lord.\n\n\u201cYou know what a harlequin is?\u201d Harley says at the beginning of the trailer. \u201cA harlequin\u2019s role is to serve. It\u2019s nothin\u2019 without a master.\u201d\n\nBut oh how things have changed.\n\n\u201cThe Joker and I broke up. I wanted a fresh start, but it turns out I wasn\u2019t the only dame in Gotham looking for emancipation.\u201d Hell yes.\n\nOh, and Ewan McGregor stars as Gotham City crime lord Black Mask. Ali Wong, Chris Messina, and Ella Jay Basco also star.\n\nEverybody looks 10/10 unhinged in this trailer, as Edith Piaf\u2018s \u201cHymne A L\u2019amour\u201d plays in the background. It\u2019s a real mood.\n\nBirds of Prey hits Aussie cinemas February 6, 2020.\n\nHalloween this year is going to be a raucous.\n\nAs for Suicide Squad, James Gunn is currently working on a reboot/remake/something (it\u2019s still not exactly clear yet) of the movie. Robbie, as well as as number of her original co-stars, will reprise her role in the film. It\u2019ll also star John Cena, Nathan Fillion, Sean Gunn, Storm Reid, Pete Davidson, Taika Waititi, and Alice Braga to name just a handful.\n\nIt\u2019s hefty.", "description": "We've copped our first look at Birds of Prey\u00a0and the Fantabulous Emancipation of one Harley Quinn,\u00a0otherwise simply known as\u00a0Birds of Prey.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-02-at-9.14.11-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
