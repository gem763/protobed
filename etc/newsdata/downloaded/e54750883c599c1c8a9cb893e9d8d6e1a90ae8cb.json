The default setting of the service is \u201copen hostility\u201d. I had grilled chicken as dry as paper and mystery fishes so charred they might have been dipped in a volcano. In a dingy bar at the top of one of the city\u2019s mountains, a squat matronish proprietor committed the gravest sin of all, not telling us when we\u2019d ordered too much, bringing out slabs and slabs of gross flabby hams and bland cheese.\n\nTourists are the other problem. There are hordes of them. Articles like this are part of the problem. Lisbon is not yet quite as bad as Rome or Venice or Prague, but it\u2019s on its way. Not all of them are stag dos, but they\u2019ve all read the same listicles and they are all at the Time Out Market, or in the queue for the O Ramiro or the Belem custard tart shop or the Frangasqueira Nacional, all the \u201cThings To Do\u201d.\n\nAt Meat Me, an oddly named sister restaurant to the oddly named seafood restaurant, Sea Me, we ate Tom\u00e1s Pires\u2019s Frenchish riffs on Portuguese classics in an airy, expensive-feeling room with a Bob-Bob-Ricard-style \u201cpress for champagne\u201d button but otherwise tasteful.\n\nThe highlight of the long lunch was a slice of pork belly served with orange, a refined take on a standard from Tom\u00e1s\u2019s childhood, traditionally served with sparkling wine.\n\nAbout 20 minutes out of town at the Praia da Princesa is a beach restaurant from a TV programme, where grilled fish is served by waiters whose hostility is mild and compensated for by extreme hotness, that kind of surly tanned vibe the Portuguese do best of all the Mediterranean countries.\n\nAt Sala de Corte, next to the hellish Time Out Market, I found a mean prego, fat slices of steak in a thick bun. I\u2019d have had a steak, but it\u2019s difficult to order a steak alone without feeling a bit Hannibal Lecter. The Rossio Gastrobar, on top of the Altis Avenida hotel where I stayed, has one of the best views in the city and a fine short sharing menu by Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues, whose other restaurant, Feitoria, has a Michelin star.\n\nBest of all was Ultimo Porto. It\u2019s nestled in the container port, so the approach feels a bit like the start of a crime drama, but the fish, barbecued over charcoal on an outdoor grill, served with butter and lemon and boiled vegetables and bright moreish yellow chips, was everything you want from an August lunch in Lisbon.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of good eating to be had here, it\u2019s just finding it can be an uphill struggle.", "description": "Everywhere in Lisbon is uphill.
