Look, he\u2019s not even 21 and hit a home run. That ball still hasn\u2019t landed!\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador told reporters Tuesday, smacking the podium with his hand, as he lamented the Nationals\u2019 5-4 victory in the opening game of the World Series.\n\nOver 700 miles from Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park, L\u00f3pez Obrador is making baseball an affair of state, seeking to revive a nation\u2019s glorious past one MLB player at a time.\n\nAD\n\nThe president, known here by his initials AMLO, has spent the playoffs providing frequent updates to the nation \u2014 with special attention to the two Mexicans playing for the Astros (pitchers Roberto Osuna and Jos\u00e9 Urquidy). But this goes beyond the game recaps.\n\nAD\n\nHe\u2019s installed a baseball promotion office in the National Palace. He\u2019s expanded Mexico\u2019s Pacific League. He\u2019s launched a plan to spend $17 million this year on baseball academies to groom Mexican talent.\n\nLatin Americans make up nearly a quarter of Major League Baseball players. But Mexico has slid behind the Dominican Republic, Venezuela and Cuba with fewer than a dozen players.\n\nFor a president who has promised social transformation on the scale of the Mexican Revolution, this is not okay.\n\n\u201cI have a dream,\u201d he said in January, \u201cthat when my term ends in 2024 we\u2019ll have at least 60 or 80 Mexicans playing in the major leagues.\u201d\n\nReviving baseball in a soccer-mad nation? Guillermo Celis, a Mexican baseball commentator for ESPN, won\u2019t rule it out. True, since taking office in December, the leftist president hasn\u2019t succeeded in resuscitating Mexico\u2019s flatlining economy, or reducing violence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut \u201cwhen he promises something having to do with baseball,\u201d Celis said, \u201che delivers.\u201d\n\nBaseball in Mexico has a long and colorful history. While it\u2019s unclear exactly when it arrived, it spread in the late 1800s, thanks to the Americans who were helping build Mexico\u2019s railroads.\n\nThe sport reflected the intertwining of the two cultures, with each nation taking advantage of the other\u2019s talents.\n\nIn the 1940s, for example, \u201cthe Mexican League was very strong because they recruited players of color\u201d when they were barred from the U.S. big leagues, baseball historian Horacio Ibarra said. Negro League stars such as Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella and Josh Gibson played in Mexico.\n\nA few decades later, Fernandomania swept Mexico. Fernando Valenzuela, a pitcher from Sonora state, starred in the World Series in 1981; to this day, Mexicans revere his Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nBaseball was an American import, but it gradually became tropicalized, Mexico\u2019s stadiums echoing with mariachi and banda music, its fans hydrated with Tecate and Corona. (In Mexico, there is no \u201clast call\u201d in the 7th inning. Or in the 8th or 9th, for that matter. \u201cit\u2019s beer, beer and more beer,\u201d as one fan put it.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, in recent decades, baseball here has suffered a decline. TV networks promoted faster-moving soccer. And Mexican pro teams charged stiff fees to allow players to sign with major league franchises, discouraging their recruitment.\n\n\u201cWhat you paid for a Mexican player, you could bring five or six Dominicans,\u201d Celis said. (Those rules were changed this year.)\n\nOf course, Mexicans still turned out to cheer their teams: the Orange Growers of Hermosillo, the Railwaymen of Aguascalientes, the Serape-Makers of Saltillo. (Let\u2019s not get started on the fandom for the mighty Tomato Growers of Culiacan, with 11 domestic championship titles as well as two Caribbean World Series victories).\n\nAD\n\nBut baseball became less a national pastime than a regional sport, popular mostly in the northwest and southeast. Places such as Tabasco state, where in the 1960s a schoolboy named Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador played center field on the local baseball team.\n\nAD\n\nHe was so crazy about the game that they called him \u201cthe American.\u201d\n\nLike every presidential candidate, AMLO made promises, and this was his offer to the good people of Guasave in northwest Sinaloa state: Vote for me, and I\u2019ll give you a baseball team.\n\nAnd so it was, on a Friday night this month, that AMLO tossed out the first pitch at Francisco Carranza Lim\u00f3n Stadium. The crowd went wild: Guasave was now home to the Algodoneros \u2014 the Cotton-Pickers \u2014 part of an expansion of Mexico\u2019s premier Pacific League, one of several winter leagues in Latin America.\n\nAD\n\nBut AMLO\u2019s visions are bigger: to make Mexico a force in the Major Leagues.\n\nThere\u2019s lots of reasons this is a worthy national goal, said \u00c9dgar Gonz\u00e1lez, the former San Diego Padre who now heads ProBeis, the government\u2019s new baseball-promotion office.\n\nAD\n\nBaseball provides good exercise in a nation getting steadily fatter, he said. \u201cSports takes kids away from vices\u201d such as working for narco-traffickers.\n\nBaseball is also \u201cone of the only sports that could bring Mexico a lot of investment,\u201d he said. There are 172 Mexicans playing professional baseball in the United States, but only 10 in the majors, with their multimillion-dollar salaries.\n\nEven as AMLO is imposing harsh austerity measures on most of the government, the baseball budget is expanding. The government is planning to open eight large baseball academies and 20 smaller indoor training facilities, Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nAD\n\nMajor League teams have visited Mexico regular-season games for more than a decade. The Padres and Dodgers played to sold-out crowds in a three-game series in Monterrey last year.\n\nSome expected this World Series might attract more fans south of the border because it features Osuna and Urquidy, both from Sinaloa.\n\n\u201cI am with the Astros because they have more Latinos,\u201d AMLO declared Tuesday. (He\u2019s normally a St. Louis Cardinals fan.)\n\nAD\n\nBut the challenge in restoring the sport to its one-time glory is substantial. Consider the scene on Tuesday night at a bar in Mexico City\u2019s trendy Roma neighborhood. Four TV screens were tuned to the World Series, which was about to begin. Excitement was at fever pitch.\n\nAD\n\nIn Houston, that is. At the Cerveceria del Barrio, almost no one was watching.\n\n\u201cI like baseball but I haven\u2019t been following the World Series,\u201d said Salvador Perez, 51. \u201cIs Washington playing?\u201d\n\nA few miles away, in the middle-class Narvarte neighborhood, several Nats and Astros fans huddled around TV screens at a bar showing the game. But they were far outnumbered by rowdy fans following the soccer Copa Libertadores on other screens.\n\nFernando Rodr\u00edguez, 29, a Yankees fan who works in publicity, said he was hopeful AMLO\u2019s plans would boost baseball here. But as he watched the game, an eardrum-shattering roar went up from the soccer fans. Someone had scored a goal.\n\nAD\n\nAD", "description": "L\u00f3pez Obrador is entertaining the country with game recaps \u2014 and spending millions of dollars in hopes of restoring Mexican baseball to its glorious past.", "authors": ["Mary Beth Sheridan", "Correspondent Covering Mexico", "Central America"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/JC40AQ8Lhvz0-ufE1owcd9kqZT0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EOJRCQXV3AI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
