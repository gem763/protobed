They accused it of breaking maritime rules.\n\nA detention order against it was lifted earlier this week, but officials said an investigation into it was ongoing.\n\nThe seizure came two weeks after an Iranian tanker was held off Gibraltar with the help of the Royal Marines. That ship was suspected of violating EU sanctions on Syria, but was released in August.\n\nEarlier this month, Iran released seven \"non-essential\" members of the Stena Impero's crew on humanitarian grounds.\n\nSixteen crew members - 13 Indians, two Russians and one Filipino - are thought to still be on board.\n\nFurther information about the tanker's release, amid reports that tracking data shows it is already moving, has not yet been confirmed.", "description": "The Stena Impero has been in custody since it was seized by Iranian troops in July.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/117C0/production/_108961617_mediaitem108961613.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
