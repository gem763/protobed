Bush this month.\n\n\u201cThese deaths mark the third, fourth, and fifth crew member suicides in the last two years,\u201d said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship\u2019s commanding officer, in a Facebook post following the deaths. \u201cNow is the time to come together as a crew and as a family to grieve, to support each other, and to care for those in need.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the veteran community was rocked by a wave of three suicides within one week that were conducted on Veterans Affairs properties.\n\nWhile suicide rates among veterans decreased from 2015 to 2016, on average about 20 current or former service members take their lives each day, according to the most recent Department of Veterans Affairs data. Of those 20, six \u2014 nearly a third \u2014 have been in VA health care.\n\nThe latest reports, paired with the new statistics, are part of a troubling trend among service members that does not appear to have a solution.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on a visit to Norfolk Wednesday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said \u201cI wish I could tell you we have an answer to prevent further, future suicides in the armed services: We don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nMr. Esper, who was confirmed by the Senate to lead the Pentagon in July, has repeatedly said that his department needs to take a more active approach to suicide prevention among the branches.\n\n\u201cThe suicides are tragic,\u201d he added. \u201cEvery single one is a tragedy. You mourn for the families and you mourn for their shipmates, everyone else.\u201d\n\nWhile the Navy did not release additional information about the cause of death of the three shipmen who took their lives last week, the Pentagon\u2019s report found that between 60% to 70% of those who die by suicide use a firearm.\n\nHowever, the report notes that historically 90% of active-duty firearm suicide deaths were by personally-owned firearms \u2014 not military-issue guns.\n\nThe majority of service members who take their lives are enlisted males under the age of 30 years old, according to the report.\n\nPentagon officials said they will implement a number of efforts to curb the rising suicide rates, including mental health initiatives, teaching service members how to respond to suicide warnings on social media, and increasing awareness of risk factors.\n\nMost notably, the officials said it is important to \u201cdestigmatize\u201d for service members who reveal mental health issues or concerning behavior to a commanding officer. Similar to the ongoing sexual assault problem within the armed forces, service members of all ranks say they are hesitant to report mental health concerns due to fear of being demoted or belittled.\n\n\u201cSeeking help is not a sign of weakness, it\u2019s a sign of strength,\u201d said newly-confirmed Army Secretary Ryan D. McCarthy and Army Chief of Staff James C. McConville in a joint statement. \u201cThe more we know about each other, the better equipped we are to recognize a call for help.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
