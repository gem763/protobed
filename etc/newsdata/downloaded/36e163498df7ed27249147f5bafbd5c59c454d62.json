Feulner Institute. The major initiative was unveiled before an audience of 1,500 at the inaugural Heritage Honors Gala at the Marriott Marquis in Washington.\n\nThe Feulner Institute is a first-of-its-kind endeavor to restore confidence in America\u2019s founding values and principles. It will be the inspiration and hub of a new effort by Heritage to reinvigorate civic culture and our national purpose. The Feulner Institute will be a source of policy research, scholarship, and policy promotion.\n\nThe institute is named in honor of Edwin J. Feulner, founder of The Heritage Foundation. Feulner has spent a lifetime advancing America\u2019s founding values and principles. Feulner is known for his commitment to building a movement \u201cby addition and multiplication, not division and subtraction.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica is exceptional and America is great, and it is our duty to make sure that future generations know these truths and know why they are the truth,\u201d said Heritage President Kay Coles James. \u201cMany people today just don\u2019t understand the uniqueness of this country and why what the founders created was so special. They don\u2019t understand that it\u2019s our founding principles that created the strongest, most free, most prosperous nation in the history of the world. Without this basic understanding, without this basic appreciation for our country, they have no idea why it\u2019s worth preserving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Feulner Institute will help Americans understand the uniqueness of this nation\u2019s founding, reinstill in Americans a love for their country, and help them understand why it\u2019s all worth preserving,\u201d James added.\n\nThis generational effort will be led by Angela Sailor, Vice President of the Feulner Institute.\n\n\u201cThe launch of the Feulner Institute is The Heritage Foundation\u2019s formal declaration that we are serious, we are strategic, and we mean to win the battle for America\u2019s future,\u201d said Sailor. \u201cThere's nobody that we won't talk to and nowhere we won\u2019t go to win back the heart and soul of this country. We are committed to preserving the American Dream and creating a lasting legacy for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, founded in 1973, is the nation\u2019s largest, most broadly-supported conservative research and educational institution. More than 500,000 memberssupport our vision to build an America where freedom, prosperity, opportunity and civil society flourish.", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Heritage Foundation President Kay Coles James announced Oct. 22 the establishment of the Edwin J.
