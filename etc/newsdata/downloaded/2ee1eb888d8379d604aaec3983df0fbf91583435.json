Shortly after that announcement, EA bought Respawn. Announced during today\u2019s keynote kicking off the Oculus Connect conference, Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is set in World War II. A demo will be playable on the Oculus Connect show floor this week.\n\nLeading the development of Above and Beyond is a figure from Medal of Honor\u2019s past: Peter Hirschmann, the producer and writer of the original 1999 game, which was done in collaboration with Steven Spielberg\u2019s Dreamworks Interactive.\n\nIn fact, Hirschmann said during a presentation at a preview event held last week in San Francisco, he was in the \u201croom where it happened\u201d in November of 1997 when Spielberg pitched the original Medal of Honor team on the idea of teaching people about WWII through the medium of an interactive game.\n\nScreenshot: Respawn\n\nHirschmann joined Respawn in 2016, heading up a third team within the studio. \u201cA lot of us always had this emotional connection, this emotional longing\u201d to revisit Medal of Honor, he said. \u201cAt the exact same time, Oculus came a-callin\u2019.\u201d The maker of the Rift wanted a triple-A experience for its headsets, and Respawn told them that what was required was not just money but time. Oculus consented, and years later, Medal of Honor is almost ready for its 2020 launch.\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the personnel department that Above and Beyond reaches back to Medal of Honor\u2019s past. Like the original Spielberg collaboration, there\u2019s a heavy educational element to this release.\n\nRespawn has conducted new interviews with many World War II veterans, the youngest of whom was 93 years old at the time of filming. (You can access these interviews in the game\u2019s Gallery section.) They even went so far as to partner with the organisation Honor Flight, which flies veterans to memorials in Washington, D.C., to bring some of the veterans back to Europe to revisit the exact places they fought in for the first time.\n\n360-degree VR videos of some of these locations let you get up close and personal with them, as well. Respawn is also scanning some archival footage from the Library of Congress into 4K for the first time ever.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make the most authentic World War II game possible,\u201d Hirschmann said. \u201cThat does not mean we\u2019re trying to make the most realistic one.\u201d You\u2019ll use the Oculus motion controllers to pick up, hold, aim, and fire your weapons. Need more ammo? You\u2019ll need to reach down to your left hip and grab some, pop it into the gun, then reach over to pull the slide back. This part is fun. \u201cYou know what\u2019s not fun?\u201d said Hirschmann. \u201cTrying to put it back in the damn holster.\u201d If you let go of your gun, it\u2019ll go back to your hip. That\u2019s emblematic of the difference Respawn is drawing between \u201cauthentic\u201d and \u201crealistic.\u201d\n\nScreenshot: Respawn\n\nWhile Above and Beyond will have a \u201cfull suite\u201d of multiplayer modes, Respawn isn\u2019t talking about that at Connect. It\u2019s showing off the single-player campaign, which will be about 10-12 hours long and spread out over 50 different levels. (Players who want to explore every inch of the levels and find all of the hidden details and secrets could see their playtime double, Hirschmann said.)\n\nThe game\u2019s three acts are as follows: One is the Resistance, putting you inside Nazi-occupied France prior to the invasion of Normandy. Two is the invasion, beginning with an Omaha Beach level. Third is about destroying the Nazis\u2019 \u201csecret weapons,\u201d such as the hydroelectric plant in Norway.\n\nPlaying a first-person Nazi shooting game is, frankly, terrifying. There\u2019s a big difference between the tutorial area, a firing range where you get to play with guns and try sniping at enemies from a distance, and the first demo level, where you\u2019re dropped into a tiny room in the back of the kitchen at the Gestapo HQ and you\u2019re meant to start walking around and finding Nazis to off. It\u2019s a definite feeling of \u201cOh crap, I don\u2019t even want to walk through this first door; what if there\u2019s a Nazi over there?\u201d\n\nMaking things more difficult is the fact that just sighting down the barrel of a gun with motion controllers in VR is not easy. That action that\u2019s so natural with twin sticks carries a big learning curve when you\u2019re holding your hands up in front of your face. Fortunately, the Nazis balance this out by being extremely stupid.\n\nMost of the time they\u2019re just standing out in the open and occasionally firing at you, like big easy targets. Even with all this advantage, it\u2019s still quite challenging to engage each enemy. If you need to heal, you pull a syringe off the inside of your left forearm and jab it into your chest. If you want to throw a grenade, you pull the pin out with your left hand \u2014 or your teeth.\n\nScreenshot: Respawn\n\nAt the beginning of one level set on a snowy mountain path, I found myself at the top of a hill near a waist-high boulder, and I knew I\u2019d have to physically duck down behind it for cover.\n\nAt that point, one of the Nazis did decide to close the gap between us, running around the rock but still staying a respectful distance from me. Meanwhile, I\u2019m down there on my knees fumbling at my waist for an ammo clip hoping that this guy just stands and watches me for a while longer before deciding to shoot me and end it all.\n\nRespawn doesn\u2019t want to \u201covergorify\u201d the scenes, though. Dead soldiers tend to just collapse to the ground without intense displays of carnage. \u201cWe don\u2019t need excessive amounts of gratuitous gore,\u201d Hirschmann said. \u201cHopefully the horror of combat comes through in you role-playing it.\u201d\n\nThere will also be downtime, including segments in which you\u2019re disguised as a German soldier and thus able to wander around and get close and personal with the enemy, seeing them going about their lives, listening in on conversations. Puzzles and interactive elements will let you do more than just shoot, too, like having to hit the keys on a piano in the correct sequence to get to a secret area.\n\nWhen asked during a roundtable Q&A following the demos, Respawn and Oculus were cagey about the possibility of Above and Beyond coming to Oculus Quest, the wire-free standalone platform that makes VR much more comfortable and accessible. They\u2019d only say that Respawn \u201cloves the Quest\u201d and that the game is \u201cexclusive to Oculus,\u201d the apparent implication being that it\u2019s not exclusive to the Rift hardware specifically.\n\nFor now, it\u2019s clear that Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is Oculus\u2019 biggest play yet to get gamers to buy a Rift headset. It\u2019s tough to know based on a short demo if the full game will truly be a tipping point that gets players buying a Rift, but that\u2019s the idea.\n\n\u201cGreat software sells great hardware,\u201d Hirschmann said. \u201cYou can have the most amazing doohickey or computer or console, and if there\u2019s nothing fun to play on it, who cares?\u201d", "description": "Electronic Arts\u2019 Medal Of Honor series of military first-person shooters is back in action, although not in the way you might expect: It\u2019s being reborn as a virtual reality game for the Oculus Rift, courtesy of Apex Legends and Titanfall developer Respawn, coming in 2020....", "authors": ["Heather Alexandra", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/nq23f7mctmn2qbm29p0m.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
