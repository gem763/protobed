This seems to be a broad question, as industry professionals point at various things. However, one thing is for certain - there are a lot of misconceptions.\n\nCryptonews.com had talked to several of the major players in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrency on this year\u2019s Baltic Honeybadger conference held in Riga, Latvia, held this September, uncovering 7 biggest misconceptions currently surrounding Bitcoin, in their opinion, and in no particular order.\n\nWatch the interviews or read a quick summary below:\n\n7 misconceptions about Bitcoin\n\n1. \u2018Why Bitcoin?\u2019\n\nAmong the first questions that should be asked and answered is not only \u201cwhat is Bitcoin,\u201d but also \u201cwhy Bitcoin,\u201d finds Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) at the U.S.-based blockchain company Blockstream. He told us that, while people look into what this coin is, they \u201cjust don\u2019t understand why Bitcoin, [\u2026] they don't really think about \u2018the why\u2019, and \u2018the why\u2019 is answering the questions like \u2018why it exists in the first place and where it fits in the grand scheme of things.\u201d He seems optimistic about it, though, saying that we\u2019re getting closer to people understanding the reason behind Bitcoin and what it's needed for.\n\nOn the same note, Mow said that there is a shift in how people see money. If we observe the way in which people are talking about it, he says, \u201cthey're making a differentiation between fiat and money.\u201d Ten years ago, people would have just said \u2018money\u2019, but now they say \u2018fiat\u2019, which Mow sees as an improvement and as a sign of people \u201csmartening up and realizing that the world is not what they thought it was,\u201d given that \u201cmoney is money, [and] fiat is an inferior form of money.\u201d\n\nLearn more: War For Control Over Money: How Can Governments Respond to Crypto?\n\n2. Bitcoin is private\n\nSome of the many fallacies about BTC that Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of crypto security specialist Casa, Jameson Lopp, has noticed going around is that it\u2019s mainly used by criminals, but also that it\u2019s mainly anonymous. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t understand how difficult it still is to actually secure it and to use it privately,\u201d the CTO told us, stressing that some don\u2019t see a need to learn more about it, saying: \u201cThere are a lot of people right now who have access to good financial infrastructure and they don\u2019t really see much incentive for them to educate themselves and better understand it.\u201d\n\nLearn more: Authorities Just Reminded That They Can Track Bitcoin Users Down\n\n3. Bitcoin is a technology, not money\n\nThere are indeed many opinions going about the Cryptoverse and beyond about what BTC is or is not, but Bitcoin Core developer and entrepreneur, Jimmy Song, chose as the biggest misconception about the coin the belief that it\u2019s a technology and not a money. \"People think that by building a better mousetrap, they have a better Bitcoin, and that's just not the case.\" There are things that are different between money and technology, and \u201cyou don't want to make constant changes with money as you do with technology,\u201d said Song.\n\nLearn more: What (Most) Bitcoiners Love About Austrian Economics\n\n4. Bitcoin is a (cheap) payment mechanism\n\nWhile others might not agree, one of our interlocutors says it\u2019s neither cheap nor is it a primarily payment mechanism. Dan Held, Director of Business Development at Kraken , finds the biggest misunderstanding to be that BTC is \u201ca cheap way to pay for coffee, that it's a cheap payment mechanism, that it was meant to disrupt Visa.\u201d He explained that maybe sometimes in the future when the price stabilizes and a lot of people start using BTC, \u201cthen maybe it transitions to that medium of exchange.\u201d Held said that this misconception has not only \u201cled to a big misalignment in expectations,\u201d but also \u201clargely damaged Bitcoin's narrative, it caused a civil war to happen, and has caused the press to say \u2018BTC is dead and it's not doing anything because people aren't paying their coffee with it', whereas when we look at gold, it's worth USD 7 trillion and no one uses it to pay for anything.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Pierre Rochard, founder of Bitcoin Advisory, a firm that specializes in Bitcoin's economics and software engineering, focuses on what he finds to be a significant distinction \u2013 that Bitcoin is primarily a savings technology, and secondarily a payments technology. While people try to minimize how much BTC they spend, they try to maximize how much government currencies they spend. He explains that people don\u2019t think of fiat as savings, but payments technology, and they want to quickly get rid of it, as \u201cyou don't want to hold EUR or USD because of the inflation they're gradually losing their value,\u201d especially over a longer period of time. So people either put them into an interest earning savings product / buy stocks or bonds, or they buy things with it. Governments contribute to this as they \u201cdeliberately make money inflationary, to discourage people from saving and encourage them to invest and consume.\u201d\n\n\"BTC does the opposite,\u201d Rochard says, \u201cas it's trying to incentivize you to hold bitcoin for a long term and to be very picky about what investments or what consumption decisions you make.\"\n\nLearn more: Now That Bitcoin 'is Digital Gold,' Which Crypto is For Payments?\n\n5. Bitcoin uses a lot of energy\n\nChief Information Officer (CIO) at blockchain technology group Bitfury, Alex Petrov, names energy usage as one of the biggest misconceptions. \u201cPeople think that Bitcoin consumes a lot of energy,\u201d says the CIO, which \u201cis not true because it\u2019s a more optimal system.\u201d As it doesn\u2019t have intermediaries, offices, and etc., \u201cit is a more efficient, more secure system which is solving the same problem in more efficient way, consuming less resources and electrical energy.\u201d He adds that people forget that \u201cthe entire bank system, all ATM machines, entire financial system right now is consuming many times more [energy].\u201d\n\nLearn more: Why Bitcoin's Energy Consumption May Be a Price Worth Paying\n\n6. Bitcoin can be compared to old technologies\n\nThere\u2019s also an opinion out there that Bitcoin simply cannot be compared to the old technologies, but that they are, if not apples and oranges, then at the very least on completely different levels. Petrov believes that people \u201care trying to reevaluate Bitcoin from the position of their previous experience,\u201d attempting to find analogies and compare their old technologies to the new ones. But those technologies aren\u2019t \u201ceven close [\u2026] Bitcoin is absolutely different,\u201d says Petrov.\n\n7. Mainstream media\u2019s portrayal of Bitcoin is trustworthy\n\nMedia often doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s talking about, is what many people believe. Discussing the lack of incentive for people with access to good financial infrastructure to educate themselves, Lopp says that they will believe \u201cwhatever the mainstream media tells them. That would probably be the case for foreseeable future.\"\n\nPetrov also says, referring to his argument that the current financial system spends more energy than BTC, that the energy argument is \u201cvery common, especially in a mainstream media,\u201d which \u201ctry to paint it from a wrong angle,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who don\u2019t understand the technical background, who don\u2019t understand having a tool that\u2019s working, who don\u2019t touch the technology, are just making not true predictions,\u201d claims Petrov, adding: \u201cYou should try to use the technology, to better understand [it] and then you can build better conclusions.\u201d\n\n____\n\nMeanwhile, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, recently also shared his opinion on what the biggest misconception about crypto in general, and certain coins in particular is, saying for Bitcoin that: \"On the Bitcoin side for example, like this idea that 2% inflation is this thing that\u2019s wrecking the economy and the next\u2026 And the next big step for progress would be turning humanity into a type one civilization that roams the stars is to get rid of existing fiat currencies and replace them with this 21 million fixed supply kind of thing. I think that\u2019s crazy.\"", "description": "\u2018Why Bitcoin?\u2019\r Bitcoin is private\r Bitcoin is a technology, not money\r Bitcoin is a (cheap) payment mechanism\r Bitcoin uses a lot of energy\r Bitcoin can be compared to old technologies\r Mainstream media\u2019s portrayal of Bitcoin is trustworthy", "authors": ["Sead Fadilpa\u0161i\u0107", "Eimantas \u017demaitis", "Linas Kmieliauskas"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/035f5b0835.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
