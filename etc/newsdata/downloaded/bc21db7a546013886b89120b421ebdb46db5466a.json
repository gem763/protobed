I am more than ready to take on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite and their apologists,\u201d Sanders told a gathering of thousands of people holding aloft placards at the Queensbridge Park.\n\n\u201cTo put it bluntly, I am back.\u201d\n\nSanders, one of 19 Democrats fighting to take on Republican President Donald Trump at the polls in November 2020 was introduced by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the leaders of the party\u2019s progressives and a frequent target of Trump\u2019s attacks.\n\nThe congresswoman announced her support to Sanders\u2019 campaign as his campaign battled to overcome the health scare and a surge in support for Elizabeth Warren, a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.\n\nSanders, 78, the oldest candidate in the crowded Democratic field, has bounced back rapidly since the Oct. 1 heart attack that threatened to derail his campaign.\n\nBut Sanders, a U.S Senator from Vermont, was already running third behind Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden in most national polls, although Sanders raised more money for his campaign in the last quarter than any other Democrat.\n\nThe rally was Sanders\u2019 largest of his 2020 campaign so far, with 25,872 people attending, his campaign said, citing a count by an outside company that managed the event, which Reuters was unable to independently verify.\n\nThe number would make the rally larger than one held in the city by Warren last month, Warren\u2019s largest of the campaign.\n\n\u201cHis supporters are so much more passionate\u201d than other Democratic candidates, said Christina Martin, 29, from Manhattan, who came to the rally with her mother, also a Sanders supporter and a breast cancer survivor.\n\nBoth said Sanders\u2019 proposal for government-run health care was his main draw, and credited him with focusing the Democratic Party on the issue.\n\n\u201cHe moved the party so much in the past four years,\u201d said Martin. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be where we are without him. We wouldn\u2019t be talking about Medicare for All.\u201d\n\nDemocratic 2020 U.S. presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) arrives to a \"Bernie's Back\" rally at Queensbridge Park in the Queens Borough of New York City, U.S., October 19, 2019.

The filmmaker Michael Moore also spoke to endorse Sanders\u2019 campaign.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, better known by her initials AOC, was welcomed with chants of \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, a reference to her proposal for a transition to renewable energy sources that has been taken up by Sanders as part of his policy platform.\n\nThe New York native went from working as a poorly paid waitress as recently as last year to sitting in Congress, she said, crediting Sanders for her own political awakening and shaking up U.S. politics with his primary challenge of eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves healthcare, housing, education and a living wage,\u201d she told the rally.\n\nOcasio-Cortez volunteered as an organizer for Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign before winning her own election to the House of Representatives last year representing a district close to the site of the rally.\n\nPROGRESSIVE PLATFORM\n\nSanders, after taking the stage to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black\u201d song, launched into a wide ranging critique of an unequal U.S. society beset by what he described as the corrupting influence of corporate power.\n\nHe noted the park he was speaking in sat beside the country\u2019s largest public housing project, Queensbridge Houses, which he said was in urgent need of repair, while just across the East River lay the shining skyscrapers of Manhattan, where banks and multinational corporations are headquartered.\n\nSanders said he would invest in public housing and education and write off medical debts, but warned that elites in politics, business and the media were working against his plans to address inequality.\n\n\u201cThey want us to believe that the only reality that we can live under is the status quo, that real change is impossible,\u201d said Sanders, also slamming moderate Democrats who questioned the affordability of his proposals during a debate in Ohio on Tuesday night.\n\nHe would raise taxes on the rich to pay for his plans, Sanders said, including through a wealth tax on those with a net worth of more than $32 million.\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nDavid Cobb, 61, said that, like many at the rally, he was drawn to Sanders\u2019 by his plans for healthcare reform.\n\nCobb had one arm in a sling from recent shoulder surgery and clutched a \u201cBernie\u201d placard under the other arm. He was accumulating thousands of dollars of medical debt, he said, despite having some coverage through the existing Medicare plan for older Americans and a health maintenance organization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s corrupt,\u201d said Cobb. \u201cWe\u2019re the only industrialized country in the world that\u2019s like this.\u201d", "description": "U.S. presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders returned to the campaign trail in New York City on Saturday, three weeks after suffering a heart attack, and pledged to resume at full throttle his battle against the business and political establishment, including members of his own Democratic Party.", "authors": ["Simon Lewis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442816873&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0N6", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
