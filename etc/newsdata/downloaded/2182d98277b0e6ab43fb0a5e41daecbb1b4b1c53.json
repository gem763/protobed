A preserved specimen can be found in the Natural History Museum.\n\nIt was previously considered a single species, but analysis of both living and dead specimens suggest there are actually three species found in different parts of China.\n\nRead more: 6 cancers on the rise in older adults, including liver, breast, and skin cancer\n\nThe South China salamander is the largest of the three and researchers think it is the largest amphibian alive today.\n\nHarvesting for the Chinese luxury food trade has led to the collapse in numbers and scientists say a renewed conservation effort is needed to save it from extinction.\n\nProf Samuel Turvey, of Zoological Society of London, said the decline in numbers in the wild is \"catastrophic\".\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, he said: \"We hope that this new understanding of their species diversity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.\"\n\nCo-researcher, Melissa Marr, of the Natural History Museum London, said: \"These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild.\"\n\nShe added that measures must be put in place to preserve the genetic integrity of each species.\n\nGiant salamanders were once found across central, eastern and southern China.\n\nBut due to a domestic luxury food market, a large-scale farming industry developed which may threaten wild populations.\n\nGiant salamanders are considered to be a \"living fossil\".", "description": "Analysis of a giant salamander found in a London museum has revealed three new species, researchers say.", "authors": ["Matt Drake", "Evening Standard"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d80d39bf4fc24793916ffa8-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
