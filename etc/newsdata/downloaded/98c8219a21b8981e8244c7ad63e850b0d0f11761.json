Sitthixay Ditthavong\n\nArchitecture firm Hassell won an award for best built project at a local and neighbourhood scale for its transformation of a former industrial site into a residential apartment complex called Flour Mill, in Sydney's Summer Hill, as did Tract for Australia's largest urban renewal project at Fishermans Bend in Melbourne.\n\nMr Snow said, broadly speaking, those commissioning projects, such as governments or the private sector, were seeing real evidence of the benefits that had emerged from adopting an urban design frame of mind when historically \"these projects were commissioned in a quite narrow frame\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think they're [investing in public space] for a couple of reasons. And the obvious one would be not so much altruistic, but certainly with a clear eye to the benefits that would flow from taking the time and care to invest in both thinking about and then integrating urban design into their development solutions,\" Mr Snow said.\n\n\"Good design adds value, not only to the broader community, but also to those who commission it. The return on investment - the urban design dividend if I can call it that - is something that developers are increasingly appreciating more and more.\"\n\n\"The larger developers have understood it for some time that urban design really does add significant value for them and and in a competitive marketplace, the community and the consumers are understanding and seeing that care and attention and are responding accordingly,\" he said.", "description": "A fusion of a engineering, architecture and landscape has been the common thread woven through the country's best urban design projects.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3034%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9b3572afb169ddd4f402259f85f461a6f1958211", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
