Most did not respond to emailed requests, while two confirmed water shortages were a major issue. One denied there was any problem, although a trader with close links to the project flagged a lack of water supplies as a crucial factor.\n\nFasa Petrochemical Company and Darab Petrochemical Company, which each own 30% in Firouzabad Petrochemical Company, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"Many of these projects were proposed by lawmakers who were trying to create jobs in their constituencies. Unfortunately the technical studies have been widely ignored,\" said Reza Banimahd, a businessman in Tehran who has worked on refinery projects.\n\nThe water shortage is one of many challenges facing Tehran as it seeks to skirt U.S. sanctions by ramping up production of products, which are more difficult to trace back to Iran than Iranian crude, which has clearly identifiable characteristics.\n\nUnder sanctions, crude exports have plunged 80% and are now worth about $700 million a month - a calculation based on Iran's normal selling price although under sanctions Iran tends to sell crude at a discount. By comparison, Tehran has kept oil product sales at about $500 million a month, Reuters calculations show.\n\nKEEPING COOL\n\nOil refineries and other processing plants need water mainly for cooling. Producing a single gallon of gasoline requires 0.61\u20130.71 of a gallon of water. But diverting limited supplies away from farming towards industry carries political risks.\n\nDrought and depleting water supplies have sparked unrest. Farmers in Iran's central region protested https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-security-water-crisis/water-crisis-spurs-protests-in-iran-idUSKBN1H51A5 in several cities in 2018 over water mismanagement, as rainfall dropped 25% below the average.\n\nThe plant in Firouzabad, an inland area in the parched south of the country, aimed to produce 1 million tonnes of ethylene a year. Based on figures for a similar capacity plant, that output would use more than 2 million tonnes of water a year.\n\nThe government, which worries about falling national groundwater levels, wants the $500 million plant moved to the coast where desalinated water could be used. But local officials and a senior cleric have objected and the project has stalled.\n\nAzizollah Hashemizadeh, Firouzabad's Friday prayer leader who reports to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the top authority in Iran's theocratic system, said in June the project would bring prosperity and could not be shifted.\n\nWhile Khamenei has the last word in state affairs, there are a range of parallel institutions below him that often compete for influence. For example, the Revolutionary Guards, an investor in the Firouzabad plant, has a separate command structure to the conventional army and has vast industrial interests.", "description": "The plan to build a petrochemical plant near the Iranian city of Firouzabad had everything usually needed to get a project off the ground: approval from the nation's top authority, funding from the Revolutionary Guards and plentiful gas feedstock.  \"In early project studies, there were some", "authors": ["Bozorgmehr Sharafedin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
