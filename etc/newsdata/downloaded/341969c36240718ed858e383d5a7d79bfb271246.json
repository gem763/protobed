REUTERS/Jose de Jesus Cortes/File Photo\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that some \u201ctargeted assistance\u201d would resume as they praised governments of the three countries for reaching immigration agreements with the United States.\n\n\u201cGuatemala, Honduras & El Salvador have all signed historic Asylum Cooperation Agreements and are working to end the scourge of human smuggling. To further accelerate this progress, the U.S. will shortly be approving targeted assistance in the areas of law enforcement & security,\u201d Trump said on Twitter.\n\nThe three countries from the so-called Northern Triangle of Central America have sent record numbers of migrants toward the United States in recent years, fueling Trump\u2019s rhetoric as part of his \u201czero tolerance\u201d anti-immigration policy.\n\nTrump campaigned on a promise to reduce illegal immigration in 2016 and has already made the issue part of his 2020 re-election bid.\n\nPompeo said in a statement that he had cut off the aid earlier this year on Trump\u2019s direction \u201cuntil the governments of these countries took sufficient action to reduce the overwhelming number of migrants coming to the U.S. border.\u201d\n\nNeither Trump nor Pompeo said how much of the hundreds of millions of dollars of suspended aid would be released. The Washington Post, citing an unnamed person familiar with the decision, reported it amounted to $143 million.\n\nThe United States used the aid suspension as leverage over the three impoverished countries that are still feeling the effects of the U.S.-Soviet proxy wars in region in the 1980s.\n\nIn response, they all reached at least partial agreements with the United States that could help Trump implement a new rule that would deny asylum to migrants and return them to Central America.\n\nThe Trump rule requires asylum-seekers to first seek safe haven in a third country they pass through on the way to the United States. The administration contends the majority of asylum-seekers are really economic migrants who will stay home if their only option is to seek asylum somewhere else.\n\nImmigrant aid organizations have sued to stop the rule, but the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed it to remain in effect pending trial.\n\nPompeo said the resumed aid would help the three countries \u201cbuild stronger local asylum systems\u201d among other uses.", "description": "The United States on Wednesday restored economic aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that had been cut off after the Trump administration complained the three Central American countries had done too little to halt a surge in migration.", "authors": ["Daniel Trotta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441641192&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1ZY", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
