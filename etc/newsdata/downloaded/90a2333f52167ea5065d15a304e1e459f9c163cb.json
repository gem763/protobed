(AP) - Arizona State had a week off to recover from injuries, refocus for the rest of the season and get ready for the next opponent.\n\nThe Sun Devils no doubt needed the extra time to prepare for one of the most difficult to defend offenses in the country.\n\nOn Saturday, No. 18 Arizona State faces Washington State and coach Mike Leach\u2019s Air Raid, the kind of offense that puts up prodigious numbers and forces opposing coaches to dig deep into their defensive playbooks.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got to give your guys the best chance to be successful, but you can\u2019t screw them up, either,\u201d Arizona State defensive coordinator Danny Gonzalez said. \u201cSo, I think there\u2019s a really fine line of trying to do stuff you can\u2019t do and what are you going to be best at. We\u2019re going to try and give our guys the best chance at being successful on Saturday afternoon and we want to attack, we don\u2019t want to defend.\u201d\n\nExcept for a 34-31 loss to Colorado, Arizona State (4-1, 1-1 Pac-12) has been solid on defense, holding its other opponents to an average of 9.5 points per game.\n\nWashington State (3-2, 0-2) will be unlike anything the Sun Devils have faced so far this season.\n\nThe Cougars lead the country in passing at 450 yards per game, are fourth in total offense at 546.8 yards and their 44.8-point average is eighth - even after a 38-13 loss to Utah before their bye week.\n\nSenior quarterback Anthony Gordon lead the FBS in passing yards with 2,146 and is second with 22 touchdown passes. Washington State has eight players with at least 15 catches, including five with more than 20.\n\nIn other words, few teams have been able to stop them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can to keep them under control, they\u2019re going to move the ball,\u201d Arizona State coach Herm Edwards said. \u201cYou can\u2019t worry about yards, it\u2019s more about points.\u201d\n\nWashington State\u2019s problem has been stopping teams.\n\nThe Cougars allowed 105 points and 1,183 total yards in the past two games, both losses, and are 105th in total defense, allowing 444.4 yards per game.\n\nThe defensive shortcomings led to recent changes. Defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys abruptly resigned last week and Cougars head coach Mike Leach elevated inside linebackers coach Roc Bellantoni to interim defensive coordinator and cornerbacks coach Darcel McBath to co-coordinator on an interim basis.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any shortage of strategy, we had too much strategy,\u201d Leach said. \u201cYou can have all the strategy in the world. Everybody thinks there is some sort of secret recipe or if someone would have just said this or just run that. It\u2019s not like that, it never has been.\u201d\n\nA few more things to look for when Washington State plays at No. 18 Arizona State:\n\nBREAKING BENJAMIN: Arizona State running back Eno Benjamin has not put up the same kind of numbers he did while finishing fifth in the FBS a year ago but is finding plenty of ways to contribute.\n\nBenjamin has become more of a pass-catching threat this season, catching 13 passes for 151 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He\u2019s also Arizona State\u2019s leading rusher with 392 yards and had three rushing touchdowns in the Sun Devils\u2019 24-17 road win against California on Sept. 27.\n\nBOUNCING BACK: Washington State\u2019s vaunted offense hit a road block in its last game against Utah.\n\nGordon had his worst game of the season, throwing for 252 yards and a touchdown with an interception. The offense was held to 313 yards and the Cougars settled for two field goals in three trips inside the Utes\u2019 20-yard line.\n\nTrying to get it ramped up again won\u2019t be easy against the stingy Sun Devils.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Arizona State had a week off to recover from injuries, refocus for the rest of the season and get ready for the next opponent.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Marshall"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/arizona_state_california_football_18988_c0-1039-2268-2362_s1200x700.jpg?93fd3bd1e3510bd5168cb622b3dc699bad7dd078", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
