That\u2019s when you think to yourself, there are people like this in the world, and these are the good ones and these are bad,\u201d Ayeza Khan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to show the bad kind as well so that it scares people and creates awareness, as is the case with the character I\u2019m currently appearing in,\u201d she added.\n\nOn her choice of scripts and work ethic, she said \u201cI don\u2019t look at whether a drama will be hit or not. I look at the message that my character will be delivering. The girls who watch me, the people who follow me, it\u2019s important for me to know what they\u2019ll be taking away at the end of the drama, be it positive or negative.\u201d\n\nKhan will be next seen in Thora Sa Haq, in which her character is very different from Mehwish.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Actress Ayeza Khan opened up about why she chose to play a character like Mehwish in ARY Digital's drama Meray Paas Tum Ho.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ayeza-khan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
