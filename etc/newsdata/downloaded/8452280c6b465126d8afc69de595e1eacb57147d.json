Almost every new stadium or arena comes with a taxpayer price tag so that billionaires who own teams don\u2019t have to dig into their own pockets to pick up the tab.\n\nAt least in Arlington they went into it willingly. Taxpayers there approved a measure in 2016 for the city to issue $500 million in bonds that will be paid off over the next 30 years with a half-cent of sales tax and hotel and car rental taxes.\n\nThat will get fans out of the heat and ensure the Texas Rangers remain in the city that also houses AT&T; Stadium, also known as Jerry World. Like the Cowboys, the Rangers\u2019 new $1.1 billion stadium - which replaces one that opened in 1994 - has a roof, something noticeably lacking at the ballpark that closes Sunday after a final series against the New York Yankees.\n\nFans in Texas like their sports, and they don\u2019t mind paying. All told they\u2019ve funded two baseball stadiums and one giant football stadium in a quarter century in Arlington alone, all paid for by increased taxes that total $1 billion without inflation, according to Dallas Morning News\n\nThey\u2019re not alone, of course. Drive down the Las Vegas Strip and there\u2019s a $2 billion stadium going up - partly funded by $750 million in taxpayer money - that will house the Raiders next year along with events too big for the city\u2019s arenas and showrooms.\n\nAnd in Atlanta, two horrible deals to replace football and baseball stadiums that still had the new game smell will end up costing taxpayers a billion dollars or so.\n\nThe stadium scam has been going on for so long that it\u2019s hard to get terribly excited about it. Team owners and developers know the playbook well, and the saps who actually pay for their edifices usually don\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nContrast that to what\u2019s happening in Los Angeles, where both the politicians and the residents seem to be smarter than the average billionaire.\n\nWalk into Dodger Stadium and it\u2019s as beautiful as it was when it opened 57 years ago. To make sure it stays that way the Dodgers are investing $100 million of their own money during the offseason to develop the space behind the outfield into a fan-friendly plaza.\n\nGo see a football game at the Coliseum and the place is sparkling, thanks to a $315 million renovation that didn\u2019t require taxpayers to put up a penny. The update even included improvements to the iconic peristyle that looks even better than it did when the stadium opened in 1923.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the $5 billion project that will open next year in Inglewood as home of the Rams and Chargers as well as restaurants, hotels and a performing arts theater. It will be the most expensive stadium complex ever and promises to be a stunning addition to the Southern California landscape.\n\nAnd the best thing? Rams owner Stan Kroenke is footing the bill.\n\nThe same thing is happening up north in San Francisco, where the Warriors will open play this year in the $1.6 billion Chase Center. With no chance of getting taxpayers to chip in, the Warriors are paying for it themselves.\n\nI\u2019ll repeat that. They\u2019re paying for it themselves.\n\nYes, it still comes with a price tag, as do the other California projects. But it will be paid by the fans who actually attend games, not by entire populations that might have no interest at all in sports.\n\nPeople in California seem to understand what people in Texas don\u2019t. They\u2019re taxed enough to begin with, and don\u2019t need even more money to come out of their pockets for corporate welfare for wealthy team owners.\n\nThat\u2019s why the Chargers left San Diego, and why the Raiders are headed for Las Vegas. Unfortunately, there\u2019s a price to be paid for refusing to stand still for a shakedown, and it cost San Diego and Oakland their NFL teams.\n\nDown in Texas, meanwhile, they still have all their teams - and soon will have something to show for their giveaway.\n\nNext season they can sit at a baseball game and not sweat.\n\n____\n\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.
