Sweden\u2019s Riksbank said earlier Thursday that it expects to end its experiment with negative rates in December, by raising its repo rate back to 0% from -0.25%.

Speculation is still swirling that the OPEC+ group of producers will announce further cuts to their output when they review their current deal in December. However, comments out of Russia this week suggest they will resist such a move, in the expectation that lower prices will stop the growth in U.S. shale output instead.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEF140VT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
