He wants to help.\n\n\u2018His behaviour was perfect in training, with the group and club. Really he knows he was wrong.\n\n\u2018He feels inside, very deep. It\u2019s normal as a human. Every player needs the supporters\u2019 support.\u2019\n\nXhaka has not commented since the substitution (Picture Rex)\n\nEmery had called for Xhaka to apologise for his actions immediately after the game at the Emirates, saying: \u2018Yes [he should apologise]. We make mistakes, we need to apologise and we suggested for him to do that.\n\n\u2018Really, he knows he was wrong and he feels inside very deep.\u2019\n\nHowever, there has been no public apology forthcoming as yet, but the Spaniard is remaining patient with his player, insisting that he is focussed on Xhaka\u2019s mental health before needing to hear him say sorry.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t need his apology,\u2019 continued Emery. \u2018Because I know he is devastated, we can speak about all the situation but first it\u2019s him.\n\n\u2018He is now very down and we need to support him.\n\n\u2018My ideal future is to watch again Xhaka playing and every supporter supporting him. I don\u2019t know if I can or will achieve it but this is my ideal.\n\n\u2018Also for him it\u2019s the same but also I think we need now to be calm step by step so we can progress.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nXhaka will not play on Wednesday night in the EFL Cup clash with Liverpool at Anfield, although a number of first team players were always going to be rested for that match.\n\nMORE: Every word Unai Emery said about Granit Xhaka, the Arsenal captaincy & Mesut Ozil before Liverpool clash\n\nMORE: Unai Emery reveals how Arsenal chief Josh Kroenke reacted to shocking Granit Xhaka outburst", "description": "Granit Xhaka will be offered counselling by Arsenal as they are concerned for his mental well-being after his outburst against fans on Sunday.
