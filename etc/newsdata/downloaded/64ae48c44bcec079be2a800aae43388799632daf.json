Katzmann of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals told lawyers at the conclusion of nearly an hour of arguments that the panel believed the attorneys \u201cmay be seeing each other again in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will likely have the last word on whether Trump can shield himself from Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.\u2019s efforts to explore the president\u2019s financial records since 2011, including his tax returns.\n\nThe hearing\u2019s most colorful exchange came when Judge Denny Chin confronted Trump attorney William S. Consovoy over what local authorities could do if Trump shot somebody on Fifth Avenue, a reference to a boast Trump made in January 2016 that doing so wouldn\u2019t cost him voters.\n\n\u2018That is correct. That is correct. Yes.\u2019 William S. Consovoy, lawyer for Donald Trump, asked by Judge Denny Chin whether it was his position that \u2018nothing could be done\u2019 while a president is in office to investigate and prosecute an alleged crime by that president\n\n\u201cLocal authorities couldn\u2019t investigate. They couldn\u2019t do anything about it?\u201d Chin asked.\n\nConsovoy said that it was not a permanent immunity and that local authorities could act once a president was removed from office.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m talking about while in office,\u201d Chin said. \u201cNothing could be done? That\u2019s your position?\u201d\n\nConsovoy answered: \u201cThat is correct. That is correct. Yes.\u201d\n\nChin foreshadowed his shooting comparison when he asked whether the president was beyond the reach of investigators \u201cno matter how heinous\u201d the crime.\n\nThe judge also asked Consovoy whether he believed the state was seeking Trump\u2019s financial records and tax returns \u201cjust to embarrass the president? Is that the argument?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Consovoy responded.\n\nVance, a Democrat, is conducting a wide-ranging probe that includes payments made before the 2016 presidential election to buy the silence of two women who said they\u2019d had sexual contact with the president.\n\nThe payments were made to porn star Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, a onetime Playboy centerfold. Both have spoken publicly about the relationships they say they had with Trump.\n\nTrump appealed after a lower-court judge tossed out his challenge to Vance\u2019s subpoena of his financial records from his longtime accountant, Mazars USA LLP.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers say the Constitution prohibits states from subjecting the U.S. president to criminal process while he\u2019s in office.\n\nVance\u2019s attorney, Carey R. Dunne, told the 2nd Circuit that no one is above the law and that the president does not enjoy the blanket immunity he claims.\n\nThe criminal probe, he said, is \u201chamstrung significantly\u201d by Trump\u2019s claims of presidential immunity from a subpoena for tax returns.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re making this up, your honor,\u201d Dunne said of the legal argument.\n\nBoth sides have agreed that no tax records will be demanded until court appeals are finished.\n\nIn court papers, Vance has said he\u2019s seeking financial and tax records of entities and individuals, including Trump, who engaged in business transactions in Manhattan.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers wrote in court papers that the request is unusual and requires more specific information.\n\nAll three judges on Wednesday\u2019s appeals panel were appointed by Democratic presidents.", "description": "Three judges on a federal appeals panel appeared inclined Wednesday to reject arguments that President Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns can\u2019t be given to a New...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT892_trump__ZG_20191023190741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
