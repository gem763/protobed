A man who worked as a technology consultant for Goldman Sachs following the attacks developed male breast cancer. A female professor discovered she had breast cancer -- and had no idea she was entitled to free health care or compensation.\n\nThese people are among 40,000 students and teachers, 25,000 residents, and 300,000 office workers who are the \u201cforgotten victims\u201d of 9/11. And just like first responders, they are increasingly getting cancer and other illnesses after being exposed to toxins at Ground Zero, attorney Michael Barasch told Fox News on Friday.\n\nBarasch's firm advocated on behalf of James Zadroga, an NYPD officer who died in 2006 from a respiratory disease he developed after working more than 450 hours at Ground Zero. He is one of three namesakes, along with late firefighter Ray Pfeifer and late NYPD Det. Luis Alvarez, on the bill that extended the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund through 2090.\n\nJON STEWART BLASTS CONGRESS OVER 9/11 FUNDING HEARING: 'DROVE ME NUTS' THERE WERE EMPTY SEATS\n\nNow, he's on a mission to get the word out to all the victims and implore them to get checked out and to join the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides treatment for responders and survivors who were in New York City, at the Pentagon or in Shanksville, Pa.\n\n\"So many have moved away from New York,\" he says. \"So many students who went to college and didn\u2019t come back. So many of the office workers who retired and moved to Florida. They don\u2019t realize they\u2019re entitled to benefits when they get sick.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the victims might be currently healthy, they were \u201cbreathing the same toxic dust as the firefighters and cops,\u201d Barasch said.\n\nHERO 9/11 FIRST RESPONDER WITH CANCER DIES AT 53; TESTIFIED TO CONGRESS WITH JON STEWART\n\n\u201cThere are only 100,000 people in the World Trade Center Health Program out of the more than 400,000 in the 9/11 community,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhat\u2019s shocking is of those 100,000, there are only 20,000 survivors. Yet survivors make up three-quarters of the 9/11 community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese people are entitled to free health care and compensation if they\u2019re sick,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nIn order to apply for the program, a person needs an affidavit, or sworn statement, proving they were at Ground Zero. Then they can apply for the health program, as well as the Victim Compensation Fund, Barasch said.\n\n\u201cEven if you\u2019re healthy now, get your affidavit and sign up for the free program,\u201d he stressed.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when you really want to start [seeking care], when you have cancer?\u201d Barasch asked. \u201cDo it now.\u201d\n\nBarasch is hosting a free information session on Monday, Sept. 16 at Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers St., from 6-8 p.m. ET.", "description": "Thousands of non-first responders have developed illnesses or cancer after being exposed to the toxins at Ground Zero.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/fireman20ground20zero320getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
