I was fuming.\n\n\"He usually gets a hot meal, but he was having a poo and there was nothing left, but they apparently made three Year 6s a cheese sandwich, but Jayden only got offered a tuna sandwich.\"\n\nMiss Jarvis, who is 22 weeks pregnant with her fourth child, said the row with the head teacher then erupted the next morning when she went into school to discuss the issue.\n\nThe stay-at-home mum from east Hull said: \"I tried talking to the head about it, but her attitude was, 'I never got told', so I said 'this is why I've come to you, you're meant to know about issues that go on with parents and pupils'.\n\n\"I said 'it won't happen again, I've told him, you don\u2019t stay at school without any lunch, you come home' and she said 'I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right to tell your child to leave school' and I said 'well I don\u2019t think its right to let my child starve'.\n\n\"She said 'we would have to ring the police if you did that'. I said 'would you like it if your child was at school with no dinner?' and she said 'I'm sure there\u2019s a way around it', but I said 'well there's not been'.\n\n\"She said 'I don\u2019t like the way you speak to me' and I said 'I don\u2019t like how Jayden was at school all day without food all day'.\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried speaking to her and I've got nowhere with her, it's like I was stood there talking to myself.\n\n\"Their attitude is 'well if he doesn\u2019t like it (the tuna sandwich), then tough. It's not his fault he missed out. You don\u2019t know how long you\u2019re going to be on the toilet for, do you?\n\n(Image: HullLive/WS)\n\n\"I said 'you would not eat something you do not like', and she said she would if you were hungry.\n\n\"She\u2019s not solved nothing. I said 'look, I don\u2019t want this to happen again, it's out of order, he was starving, he\u2019s a big lad, I'm not going to lie, he likes his food, he was upset'.\n\n\"She said 'I find you rude to my staff', but I am a person who says it how it is and that\u2019s what they don\u2019t like.\n\n\"I said 'right well he won\u2019t be going to school'. I've kept him off school.\n\n\"If the situation had got resolved and I wasn't spoken to like they wasn\u2019t bothered about my child then I would not have taken it further.\"\n\nJayden has been at Thanet Primary School for the past eight months, after Miss Jarvis removed him from Longhill Primary School, and is entitled to free school meals.\n\nMiss Jarvis said she is now going to make an official complaint to the chair of governors at the school.\n\nShe said: \"I'm keeping him off until they are willing to speak to me properly and apologise to Jayden for making him upset and hungry.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Thanet Primary School said \u201cThanet Primary School ensures that every pupil at the school is provided with a nutritious meal at lunchtime.\n\n\"Parents are always welcome to contact the school to discuss their children\u2019s meal options.\u201d", "description": "Stacy Jarvis, 31, from Hull, was furious with Thanet Primary School after her son 'went hungry all day' because he was late for lunch", "authors": ["Joanna Lovell", "Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Hulllive Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20549732.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_East-Hull-mum-pulls-son-out-of-school-after-row-with-head-teacher-over-a-tuna-sandwichJayden-Hunter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
