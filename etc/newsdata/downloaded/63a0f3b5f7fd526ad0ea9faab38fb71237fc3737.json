And you'll see how many goals he'll score. We were together at Everton. He was very young but very intelligent and has said important things about racism.\u201d\n\nRacism is an issue close to Eto\u2019o\u2019s heart and it wounded him to see Inter\u2019s Curva Nord defend Cagliari supporters after they targeted Lukaku for such abuse in a recent fixture.\n\nThe 38-year-old, who had spells with Real Madrid, Barcelona, Inter, Chelsea, Sampdoria and many more during a long and distinguished playing career, believes that there should be a general strike in response to the issue.\n\n\u201cGetting off the field is the right answer,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball moves a lot of money but most of the players who generate it are black. If one day, all over the world, with the help of their white colleagues, they decided not to play, that's it: it would change a lot.\n\n\u201cFIFA president Gianni Infantino said something very important on the night of the FIFA Best awards: \u2018No more talking: doing.\u2019 The head of world football said that.\n\n\u201cWe need rules in football, too, tough rules.\n\n\u201cIn future, I\u2019d like to be remembered not as a footballer, but as a guy who brought something to football. And who helped in the fight against racism.\u201d", "description": "The former Barcelona forward says that the only way to stop the issue in the game is for players to walk off the field of play", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WS25XjcGqyPzXjExshvkQg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y0t5bvx6jSqm_7Bd4Fi0KA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/e1445c21ebe913ea680021e7f9a95945"}
