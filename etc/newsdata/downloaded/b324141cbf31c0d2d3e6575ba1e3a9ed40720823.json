Obama-era figures have reason to sweat", "language": "en", "text": "A number of former high-level Obama administration officials could fall into the investigative crosshairs of U.S. Attorney John Durham's team as his probe into the handling of the Russia investigation rises to the level of a criminal inquiry.\n\nThe elevation in status means the U.S. attorney for Connecticut will be able to subpoena witnesses, file charges and impanel grand juries.\n\nTRUMP SAYS 'INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS' AS DURHAM PROBE TOUCHES OFF NEW WAR IN CONGRESS\n\n\u201cYou do not impanel a grand jury at this point unless you are going to indict,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News. \u201cDurham is at a point where he knows he has crimes and now the question is how many people were involved and they have a pretty good idea of that group of people and what the charges can be and whether or not they can get some cooperators.\u201d\n\nThe development has prompted allegations from Democrats that the Department of Justice is being politicized. Attorney General Bill Barr, however, rejected those claims and defended the Durham probe in an interview earlier this week with Fox News, while accusing the James Comey-era FBI brass of a \"failure of leadership.\"\n\nThose bureau leaders and others could well be questioned as part of Durham's probe, as speculation runs rampant over who might be at risk of being charged.\n\nFor his part, Comey was asked about Durham\u2019s investigation at the recent Politicon convention in Nashville. He said he's \u201cnot worried about a single thing in connection with any of the matters under investigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cGather the facts, write a report and share it with the American people \u2014 please do that,\u201d Comey said. \u201cDon\u2019t drip it out. Don\u2019t leak it out. Give it out. And I\u2019m confident that when the American people see the picture of why we did what we did, their confidence in the institution will be maintained, restored and protected.\u201d\n\nComey also praised Durham as someone who has \u201ca strong professional reputation\u201d and someone he has \u201cfor years thought was an excellent prosecutor.\"\n\n\u201cI would hope Mr. Durham will do everything possible to protect his reputation from being damaged by those in leadership, and the most important way he can do that is give us transparency,\u201d he continued.\n\nOne source told Fox News that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz\u2019s forthcoming report, which will focus on alleged abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in connection with the early stages of the Russia probe, will shed light on why Durham\u2019s investigation has become a criminal inquiry.\n\nHorowitz, for more than a year and a half, has been investigating alleged misconduct related to the FISA warrants delivered by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The Justice Department and the FBI obtained warrants during the final months of the Obama administration in 2016 to surveil Trump adviser Carter Page. It is unclear, at this point, if Page was the only Trump campaign official that the DOJ obtained a FISA warrant against.\n\nWith regard to Page\u2019s FISA application, there was \u201cone initial FISA warrant\u201d targeting his and three other renewals from the FISC. The statute requires that every 90 days a FISA order on an American citizen \u201cmust be reviewed.\u201d\n\nFormer FBI Director Comey signed three FISA applications for Page, while former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and former Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente signed at least one, according to a House Republican memo filed last year.\n\nOne source told Fox News that it would be a \u201cnecessity\u201d for Durham to interview the majority of those officials as part of his probe.\n\nEXPANSIVE DURHAM PROBE COULD GIVE TRUMP AMMO AMID IMPEACHMENT FIGHT\n\nMeanwhile, Fox News has learned that Durham is \u201cvery interested\u201d in questioning former CIA Director John Brennan and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. According to a source familiar with the situation, Brennan has received word from his attorney that he may be contacted by Durham\u2019s office, but Clapper has received no such communication at this time.\n\nA prominent Trump critic, Brennan continues to take swipes at the president amid the impeachment inquiry over allegations he improperly pressured Ukraine to launch politically helpful investigations. After Trump questioned the account of a witness who this week voiced concerns about those conversations, Brennan tweeted: \"As in previous times of National peril, we rely on our military, diplomats, intelligence officials, law enforcement officers, & other courageous patriots to protect our liberties, freedom, & democracy. May they stay resolute & strong despite corrupt political headwinds they face.\"\n\nBecause Durham\u2019s investigation is focused on a timeline spanning from the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential election through the spring of 2017, former FBI special agent Peter Strzok will likely be seen as another key figure. Strzok, on July 31, 2016, officially opened the FBI\u2019s initial Russia investigation.\n\nIn a separate review led by Horowitz, politically charged text messages between Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page were revealed. Page was also involved in the early stages of the bureau\u2019s Russia probe, and she and Strzok both later served on former Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team to investigate Russian meddling and alleged collusion with members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\n\nStrzok's role has also come under question regarding the original interview of former national security adviser Mike Flynn, who later pleaded guilty to giving false statements concerning his discussions with Russia's ambassador. His lawyer recently alleged that official FBI files on that interview were manipulated.\n\nProsecutors have cast doubt on these allegations, though, saying in a Tuesday filing: \"In an extraordinary reversal, the defendant now claims that he is innocent of the criminal charge in this case\" and \"makes this claim despite having admitted his guilt, under oath, before two federal judges.\"\n\nAlso, as part of his probe, Durham has traveled with Attorney General Barr to Italy and had conversations with law enforcement officials in the U.K. and Australia about their investigation, according to multiple sources familiar with the meetings.\n\nThe team is \u201cgathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries,\u201d Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.\n\nThis week, during an exclusive interview with Fox News, Barr said that while he\u2019s assisting in connecting Durham with countries that could have valuable information, Durham is running the show.\n\n\u201cHe is in charge of the investigation, I\u2019m not doing the investigation,\u201d Barr said, calling Durham \u201cthorough and fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of the countries that John Durham thought might have some information that would be helpful to the investigation wanted preliminarily to talk to me about the scope of the investigation, the nature of the investigation, and how I intended to handle confidential information and so forth,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSo I initially discussed these matters with those countries and introduced them to John Durham and established a channel by which Mr. Durham can obtain assistance from those countries.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats have blasted Durham\u2019s investigation, and taken direct aim at Barr.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge,\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a joint statement after learning Durham\u2019s probe had become a criminal inquiry. \u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner also spoke out against Durham\u2019s probe, saying Friday that the Senate Intelligence Committee \u201cis wrapping up a three-year bipartisan investigation, and we\u2019ve found nothing remotely justifying this.\u201d\n\nHe called on Barr to testify before Congress.\n\nIn response to such criticism, Barr said, \"It wouldn't be appropriate at this stage for me to discuss the Durham investigation.\" He said he'd \"certainly inform the public and Congress\" when possible.\n\nAs for the direction of the investigation, he said: \"We\u2019ll let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nFox News' Jake Gibson and Sam Dorman contributed to this report.", "description": "A number of former high-level Obama administration officials could fall into the investigative crosshairs of U.S. Attorney John Durham's team as his probe into the handling of the Russia investigation rises to the level of a\u00a0criminal inquiry.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
