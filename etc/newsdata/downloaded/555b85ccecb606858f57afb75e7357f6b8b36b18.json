Trump has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nTwo committees of the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives have separately subpoenaed Deutsche Bank AG for Trump's financial records, which include tax returns.\n\n\"The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,\" Trump tweeted after Marrero's decision. \"A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!\"\n\nIn suing Vance last month to block his subpoena, Trump said he was immune from criminal probes while in the White House and that the U.S. Constitution required Vance to wait.\n\nThe Constitution does not say whether sitting presidents can be indicted, and the Supreme Court has not decided the issue.\n\nFederal prosecutors cannot charge sitting presidents because presidents have temporary immunity, according to the Department of Justice, but that does not block criminal probes by state-level prosecutors like Vance or even federal prosecutors.\n\n\"It's uncharted legal terrain,\" Jens David Ohlin, vice dean at Cornell Law School, said in an interview.\n\n\"If the framers of the Constitution desired a president who was completely immune from all forms of criminal prosecution, they would have said so,\" he added. \"The counterargument is that the Constitution would prohibit it because it would infringe on the president's ability to govern the country.\"\n\nVance issued the subpoena four weeks after issuing another subpoena to the Trump Organization for records of hush money payments, including to two women prior to the 2016 election who said they had sexual relationships with Trump, which he denies.\n\nThose payments were made to Stormy Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, with the involvement of Trump's now-imprisoned former lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nTrump is also trying to block the House subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and is awaiting a ruling from the 2nd Circuit.\n\nThe House probes are separate from the debate over whether Trump should be impeached because of his dealings with Ukraine.\n\nJay Sekulow, a lawyer for Trump, said he was pleased the Vance subpoena was put on hold. Danny Frost, a spokesman for Vance, declined to comment.\n\nThe Justice Department, which opposed dismissing Trump's challenge to the subpoena, declined to comment.\n\nMazars did not respond to requests for comment, but has said it would comply with its legal obligations.\n\nIn his decision, Marrero, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, declined to assert jurisdiction over the Vance subpoena, saying Trump should have brought his case in a New York state court.\n\nBut the judge made clear that if the appeals court disagreed with that finding, Trump should lose.\n\nMarrero said the president failed to show that enforcing the subpoena would interfere with his presidential duties, cause irreparable harm or be against the public interest.\n\nHe also rejected as too broad the idea of shielding Trump, his family and his businesses from criminal process.\n\n\"The expansive notion of constitutional immunity invoked here to shield the President from judicial process would constitute an overreach of executive power,\" Marrero wrote.\n\nMarrero said even President Richard Nixon conceded during the Watergate scandal that he would be required to produce documents in response to a judicial subpoena.\n\nTrump's lawyers said the case raised \"momentous\" questions about the president's immunity and complying with the subpoena would cause irreversible damage.\n\n\"There will be no way to unscramble the egg scrambled by the disclosure,\" the lawyers said in a court filing.\n\nTrump is running for re-election. His current term ends on Jan 20, 2021.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "A federal judge on Monday said eight years of U.S. President Donald Trump's tax returns must be provided to Manhattan prosecutors, forcefully rejecting the president's argument that he was immune from criminal investigations.
