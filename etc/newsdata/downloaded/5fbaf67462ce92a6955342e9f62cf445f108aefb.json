What\u2019s It Worth?", "language": "en", "text": "The Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said that debates can help drive future coverage, resulting in a snowball effect. But she added that candidates\u2019 fortunes will largely be determined on the ground in early-voting states.\n\n\u201cI think that honestly, the debates are having more impact on news coverage than they are having impact on voters,\u201d Ms. Lake said. \u201cCandidates don\u2019t get known by unveiling a good plan at the debate. They become known by immersing themselves in these early states.\u201d\n\nTo qualify for November\u2019s debate, candidates will need to reach 5 percent support in two polls in early nominating states, or 3 percent in four early-state or national polls. These are higher thresholds than for any debate thus far. A bump after next week\u2019s debate could, at the very least, help candidates such as Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or the former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro \u2014 who are now foundering in the low single digits \u2014 secure a spot onstage next month.\n\nBut historically, early debates have been more likely to disqualify a candidate than to provide a lasting jolt of momentum. In 2011, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas pledged in an early debate to eliminate three agencies from the executive branch if elected president but couldn\u2019t remember the name of one of the agencies. He never recovered from the flub. (When Mr. Trump became president, however, Mr. Perry was chosen to head the Department of Energy, the very agency he had forgotten to name.)\n\nLast election cycle, the businesswoman Carly Fiorina enjoyed a strong showing in the second Republican primary debate, seeing a sizable uptick in support in the days afterward. But she could not convert it into a consistent climb in the polls.\n\n\u201cSuccessful first debate performances create buzz for a candidate but also generate expectations for continued success,\u201d the historian and presidential scholar Bruce Buchanan wrote in an email. \u201cIf he or she does O.K. but less well in the second debate, the story is about underperformance.\u201d", "description": "In a crowded field, experts agree, debates can result in a momentary spike in support for second-tier candidates \u2014\u00a0but it rarely lasts.", "authors": ["Giovanni Russonello"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/us/politics/11pollwatch/11pollwatch-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
