Thankfully, Aston Martin is putting us out of our misery in the latter regard.\n\nThis week, the historic British marque revealed that four of its cars will appear in the 25th Bond movie: the DB5, V8 Vantage, DBS Superleggera and Aston Martin Valhalla.\n\nPast, present and future. To mark the 25th Bond film, #NoTimeToDie, four of our cars will be featured in the film. From the classic DB5 and V8 Vantage, to the new DBS Superleggera and Aston Martin Valhalla, there is something for every Bond fan.#JamesBondDay@007 pic.twitter.com/cmKvswriHo \u2014 Aston Martin (@astonmartin) October 5, 2019\n\nTo be fair, three out of the four vehicles were previously all but confirmed via various spy shots. For example, while the DB5 was no surprise (having been featured in many Bond films from 1964\u2019s Goldfinger to 2012\u2019s Skyfall) the V8 Vantage has only been seen before in 1987\u2019s The Living Daylights, but was spotted filming a scene in Norway.\n\nHowever, the V12 DBS Superleggera is a new revelation. As Car and Driver notes, \u201cThe number of cylinders in a DBS have doubled since its first feature in a James Bond film, which began all the way back to 1969 with On Her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service, and this will be the fourth time a DBS has been in the series.\u201d\n\nThis is exciting news for Bond and Aston Martin fans alike, but there is one group that may be saddened by the announcement: electric vehicle disciples. It was previously reported (by an anonymous source) that No Time to Die director Cary Joji Fukunaga was working directly with Aston Martin to get the marque\u2019s first all-electric car, the Rapide E, a spot in the film. From this tweet, the prospect doesn\u2019t look promising.\n\nOn the other hand, Naomie Harris, the actor who plays Moneypenny, recently told British GQ that we can expect \u201cmassive, massive surprises\u201d from the film. Cross your fingers that includes Bond in an EV.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "Aston Martin confirmed four of its cars will be appearing in the 25th James Bond film \"No Time to Die,\" starring Daniel Craig and premiering April 2020.", "authors": ["Alex Lauer"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/bond_social.jpg?fit=1200%2C630", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
