'The reason is because I had been sexually abused to the point that men made me sick. I didn't trust them, I didn't like them.'\n\nSpeaking out: Marie Osmond brought up being the victim of sexual abuse as a girl of 8 or 9 while discussing Miley Cyrus on The Talk on Monday\n\nOsmond, 60, told her co-hosts she felt so sickened by men that she thought she was gay\n\nThe raven-haired singer, who has been married three times - twice to the same man - and has eight children, said that she had body image issues as a girl and was fixated on other women's bodies.\n\n'I was looking at women and I thought, \"Why am I looking at women? I must be gay.\" And then I realized - because I'm a thinker - why did God give me all these great brothers and why did He give me this amazing father?' Osmond recalled thinking to herself. 'And truly, that changed my opinion of men, which made me feel that it was something that I was going through.'\n\nOsmond was quick to stress that she was not making a generalization about other people's sexuality, but was referring to her own life and how she viewed herself in the wake of her abuse.\n\nOsmond has publicly discussed being molested as a child and a teen several times over the years, including in her 2001 book, 'Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression.'\n\nOsmond has publicly discussed being molested as a child and a teen several times over the years (pictured left in 1970, alone and with brother Donny)\n\nShe never revealed the identity of her abuser, only saying that was not a family member or a friend, but rather someone who had access to her for a limited time.\n\nOsmond wrote in her biography that the person who molested her had threatened her and her family, leaving her terrified.\n\nShe brought up her experiences as a sexual abuse survivor during a taping of The Talk last month while discussing Demi Moore's claim that her mother sold her for sex when she was 15 yeas old.\n\n'I know that I judged my mother when I was being sexually abused,' she said. 'As a child. I always thought, \"Why did she not see that? How could she not see that?\" And it took me being a mother to understand there are things you miss.'\n\nBacktracking: Cyrus, who came out as bisexual four years ago, has defended herself after the comment attracted criticism during the social media talk on Sunday night\n\nCyrus, 26, sparked outrage when she said in an Instagram Live conversation with her new boyfriend, Cody Simpson, on Sunday: 'You don't have to be gay; there are good people with d***s out there - you\u2019ve just got to find them. You've got to find a d*** that's not a d***, you know.'\n\nCyrus then added: 'I always thought I had to be gay because I thought all guys were evil, but it's not true. There are good people out there that just happen to have d***s. I've only ever met one, and he's on this Live.'\n\nAfter facing widespread backlash from the LGBTQ community for implying that being gay was a choice, Cyrus, who came out as bisexual four years ago, backtracked, writing in a tweet on Monday: 'I was talking s**t about sucky guys, but let me be clear, YOU don't CHOOSE your sexuality,' she tweeted. 'You are born as you are. It has always been my priority to protect the LGBTQ community I am a part of.'", "description": "Marie Osmond, 60, made the comments on The Talk  while weighing in on Miley Cyrus' controversial Instagram tirade, in which the Wrecking Ball singer talked about her resentment toward men.", "authors": ["Snejana Farberov For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/16/20041774-0-image-a-19_1571757563555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
