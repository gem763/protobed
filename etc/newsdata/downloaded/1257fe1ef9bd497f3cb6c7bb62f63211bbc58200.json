After years of exploration, Huzhou is vigorously promoting the development of \"Ecology + Electricity\" demonstrative city by integrating the sustainable development concept with its power sector, said Xiang Lemin, deputy mayor of Huzhou municipal government at the forum.\n\nHuzhou has operated a number of typical \"Ecology + Electricity\" demonstrative projects by now, he added.\n\nZhejiang Province has been comprehensively promoting the clean energy system in recent years. During this process, State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company responded positively by exploring an electricity-dominant and clean and efficient energy system in Huzhou,said Li Jihong, assistant to general manager of State Grid Zhejiang Electric Power Company.\n\nAccording to Li, Huzhou has been accelerating the utilization of renewable energy, promoting the all-around use of electricity in logistics sector and scenic areas, and improving power infrastructures in ports and bus stations. By taking all these measures, the proportion of electricity in end-use energy has been rising at a rapid pace in Huzhou, said Li.\n\nThe green development mode of Huzhou is replicable, as it presents a good example for other cities and energy enterprises when it comes to deepening green development and pushing ahead enterprises' transformation and upgrading, said Yu Wu, deputy director-general at China Enterprises Confederation.\n\nAgainst the background of clean and low-carbon energy development, Huzhou's efforts to promote the eco-development of its power system could work as practical demonstration for clean and low-carbon energy production and consumption and urban energy management transformation, said Gao Shixian, deputy director-general at the Energy Research Institute of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).\n\nThe concept of ecological development has been deeply rooted among the public in recent years. Today, we are more concerned about our living environment, and the ecological development is playing a more important role in almost every aspect of urban planning and constructions, said KuangLecheng, vice president of China Economic Information Service (CEIS).\n\nDuring the forum, Li Jijun, deputy general manager of CEIS's Economic Think Tank Department, released the Huzhou \"Ecology + Electricity\" Development Index Report. The report evaluates the green and ecological development of Huzhou's electric power system by assessing its electricity system from different aspects such as green production, green consumption, green operation, as well as its impacts on the ecological environment.\n\nThe forum was hosted by Huzhou municipal government. During the forum, the organizers also released the \"Ecology + Electricity\" manifesto, calling on the public and all enterprises and organizations to participate in the action of promoting environmental protection and low carbon development.", "description": "The International Forum on Demonstrative City Construction for \"Ecology + Electricity\" was held Thursday in Huzhou City of east China's Zhejiang Province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
