Observers say in just the last four days, as many as 60 civilians have been killed with thousands of others fleeing.\n\n\"In order to prevent and block this assault, agreement has been reached with the Syrian government whose duty is to protect the borders and Syrian sovereignty, for the Syrian army to enter and deploy along the length of the Syrian-Turkish border,\" a Kurdish statement said.\n\nKurds say Syrian forces will start spreading out along the border Sunday and should be totally deployed within two days. The Kurdish statement came shortly after the official Syrian news agency reported that the army was sending in troops to \"confront Turkish aggression.\"\n\nSyrian Kurds say they feel totally forsaken by the United States after fighting side-by-side with U.S. forces against Islamic State extremists in Syria. They also believe much of the Arab world and the UN Security Council are ignoring them.\n\n\"We had to find a solution...now you see what has happened to us and they don't want to support us,\" the defense minister of the Kurdish city of Kobani, Ismat Sheikh Hassan, said Sunday. \"Again, we should not trust anybody. We should rely on ourselves. Every Kurd should carry a gun and prepare himself.\" Hassan called on young Kurds to stay in their homes while the elderly and children can leave if they wish to go.", "description": "Kurds Strike Deal with Syrian Army to Counter Turkey", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/14/2019101400470_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
