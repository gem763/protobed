You send him a direct message on social media in appreciation and asking for any advice. Years later, you're on the same team as him, sharing pass-catching duties for the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThat's the story when it came to JuJu Smith-Schuster, who slid into AB's DMs when he was in college. Well, that was the beginning of the story.\n\nNow, what's their relationship like?\n\nWell, it's complicated, as the saying goes, but Smith-Schuster still shows a sense of respect, as he told Michael McKnight in an interview with Sports Illustrated:\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster has no hard feelings toward Antonio Brown.\n\n\n\nOn the NFL's millennial man: https://t.co/wMYlCEQPw6 pic.twitter.com/nhnnnvOQaD\n\n\n\n\u2014 Sports Illustrated (@SInow) September 4, 2019\n\nBrown never did respond to that initial message from Smith-Schuster -- at least not in that instance.\n\nIs Antonio Brown trying to make JuJu Smith-Schuster look good?

But now that Brown is a member of the Oakland Raiders, the ghost of AB lingers in the Steelers' locker room, and on the different platforms.\n\n\"Now that AB left and I'm the No. 1 guy, people are gonna say, 'Is he going to take it more seriously? Is he going to do less social media? Less public stuff?' \" Smith-Schuster said. \"At the end of the day, I'm not gonna change because one person left. I'm gonna do what I always do, which is what's best for the team.\"\n\nSo, he's still going to be JuJu.\n\n[RELATED: Why Von Miller believes AB gets a bad rap]\n\nBrown's relationship with the Steelers still remains sour, but the one commonality beneath all of the drama is the fact they all can agree on AB's talent.
