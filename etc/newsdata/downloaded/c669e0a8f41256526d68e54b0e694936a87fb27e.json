These things happen in life and thankfully he was strapped in nicely to his car seat.\"\n\nHart was supposed to be Clarkson's first-ever guest on her new TV talk show, so following the accident Johnson cut short his honeymoon (with his new wife's permission) to fill in.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe pair are close friends - having starred together in films including Jumanji and Central Intelligence - and the former professional wrestler, 47, confirmed he would soon pay Hart a hospital visit.\n\n\"I love the guy, he's one of my best friends,\" Johnson went on.\n\n\"And honestly, I mean, thank God, it could have been a lot worse.
