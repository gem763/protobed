Muybridge's instantaneous photography made motion visible and from the late 1870s he took thousands of images studying humans and animal movement.\n\nBut the horse was the source of all transport of importance, so to understand its movement was critical: does it have all four feet off the ground in a gallop? One person with a stake in the debate was the ambitious Leland Stanford \u2013 founder of Stanford University, and owner of champion racehorses \u2013 with an obsession to breed yet faster champions.\n\nTo settle a bet he\u2019s said to have made with the San Francisco Chronicle, Stanford commissioned Muybridge, armed with rows of cameras and trip wires, to capture split-second movements from his stock farm in Palo Alto. The horse did indeed lift all four legs off the ground during its stride. However, this was not in the front-and-rear extended posture some had expected, but with all four feet tucked under the horse.\n\nPainters such as Edgar Degas and Thomas Eakins loved the realism and used Muybridge's photos to move their own work closer to reality.", "description": "Exploring the hidden connections between art and science.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07ns781.jpg"}
