It is a story that appeals across partisan lines. The same month Pelosi referenced it, Supreme Court Justice Neil M. Gorsuch released a book titled \u201cA Republic, If You Can Keep It.\u201d It\u2019s a recognizable national origin story with broad appeal; Pelosi was savvy to use it.\n\nBut she got the story wrong. So did Gorsuch.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey\u2019ve missed the most important element of the story: Who asked Franklin the question that sparked his witty response? It was Elizabeth Willing Powel, a pivotal woman of the founding era who has been erased from this story. Her erasure not only creates a founding-era political history artificially devoid of women, but it also makes it harder to imagine contemporary women such as Pelosi \u2014 or Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren or Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 as political leaders.\n\nThe first record of the anecdote appears in a 1787 journal kept by one of the delegates to the convention, James McHenry of Maryland. He wrote: \u201cA lady asked Dr. Franklin Well Doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy. A republic replied the Doctor if you can keep it.\u201d McHenry added a footnote to the text: \u201cThe lady here alluded to was Mrs. Powel of Philad[elphi]a.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Powel of Philadelphia\u201d was well-known. During the Constitutional Convention, Powel used her elegant townhouse as a political salon, hosting dinner parties and gatherings that provided a sociable space for political movers and shakers \u2014 and their wives \u2014 to meet and discuss politics. Powel was born into two of Philadelphia\u2019s wealthiest and most politically connected families; her father, her mother\u2019s grandfather, her uncle, her brother and her husband, Samuel Powel, all served as mayors of Philadelphia. Her husband served as both the last Colonial and the first post-revolutionary Philadelphia mayor.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut she, rather than her husband, was the acknowledged political thinker in the marriage. As a French nobleman observed, \u201ccontrary to American custom, [Mrs. Powel] plays the leading role in the family,\u201d and \u201cwhat chiefly distinguishes her is her taste for conversation\u201d and \u201cher wit and knowledge.\u201d The Powels were close friends with George and Martha Washington. When George Washington expressed doubts about a second term in office, she wrote advising him \u2014 successfully \u2014 to stand for a second term. Washington kept that letter until he died.\n\nIn 1803, McHenry first published the \u201ca republic, if you can keep it\u201d anecdote in an anonymous newspaper submission, followed by a series of writings and a pamphlet over the next decade. And while his story evolved to reflect his own anti-Jeffersonian politics, Powel remained at its center as \u201ca lady remarkable for her understanding and wit.\u201d In later renditions, McHenry set the scene with Franklin \u201centering the room\u201d to talk to her.\n\nAs the story became better known, Powel tried to recollect the exchange. Writing to a female relative in 1814, she confessed that she could not recall \u201ca conversation supposed to have passed between Dr. Franklin and myself respecting the goodness, and probable permanence of the constitution [sic] of these United States.\u201d But that, she wrote, was probably because she \u201cassociated with the most respectable, influential Members of the Convention that framed the Constitution, and that the all important Subject was frequently discussed at our House.\u201d Because anyone who was anyone attended her gatherings, it was difficult to keep track of the many political conversations that took place in her salon.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201ca republic, if you can keep it\u201d story did not get much popular play for the rest of the 19th century \u2014 even during the tumult of the Civil War. In 1906, it achieved new fame with the inaugural publication of McHenry\u2019s journal. Since then, it has been told and retold innumerable times \u2014 but in different versions that change with the times.\n\nFor example, a publication cautioning against electing Franklin D. Roosevelt to an unprecedented third term in 1940 was titled \u201cA Republic if You can Keep It.\u201d\n\nMost critically, the central role of Powel was erased in the 20th century. The setting of the story moved from Powel\u2019s townhouse to the streets outside Independence Hall, privileging an idea of the public square where only men\u2019s ideas were heard. But private quarters played a prominent role in political debates. For women like Powel, shut out as they were from institutional politics, domestic spaces were among the few places they could engage in political discussion \u2014 and lead the conversation while hosting politicians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe role of Powel herself changed over time, too. First forgotten as the host of the exchange, she was then recast as a nervous but ordinary woman rather than a \u201clady remarkable for her understanding and wit.\u201d This version of the story affirmed the genius of the Founders, keeping infallible, elite white men at the center of the nation\u2019s history. While Powel receded, Franklin remained omnipresent, a founding sage dispensing wisdom to lesser Americans \u2014 particularly women, the anonymous \u201clady\u201d who replaces Powel implies \u2014 who need his guidance.\n\nEven when she is still mentioned by name, as in Walter Isaacson\u2019s best-selling book \u201cBenjamin Franklin: An American Life\u201d (2003), she is described as an \u201canxious lady\u201d who \u201caccosted\u201d Franklin, asking \u201cwhat have you given us\u201d rather than \u201cwhat we have got\u201d\u2014 a change implying her passive role in the political process. She is cast as a shrill, inappropriate woman, excluded from the politics of the nation\u2019s founding.\n\nIn Pelosi\u2019s and Gorsuch\u2019s tellings, Powel is forgotten entirely.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo why does the history of this anecdote matter?\n\nTracing its twists and turns over the centuries, we see Powel, a politically active, influential patriot in her own time, shaped to mold expectations about the history of women and politics. The story shifts \u2014 from her own assertion that she couldn\u2019t possibly remember all the many important political conversations that took place within her home, to one in which she is simply an \u201canxious\u201d lady \u201caccosting\u201d Franklin, to the recent omission of women at all.\n\nAs we consider how and why America continues to elide the history of founding women from its collective origin story, we should take note that in 2019 we actually give less credit to this politically savvy woman than men did during the founding era. Recognizing women\u2019s leadership in the past, as well as the present, might make it easier to keep a republic.\n\nAD", "description": "Erasing the women of the founding era makes it harder to see women as leaders today.", "authors": ["Zara Anishanslin", "Zara Anishanslin Is An Associate Professor Of History", "Art History At The University Of Delaware", "A Postdoctoral Fellow At The Mcneil Center For Early American Studies At The University Of Pennsylvania", "Author Of", "Portrait Of A Woman In Silk", "Hidden Histories Of The British Atlantic World."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LPUyi5CQuAbNb1BoewCvk6ChT8Y=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZVYIEBHPUYI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
