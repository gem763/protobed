Dozens of videos and photographs posted on YouTube and Instagram appear to have been shot using a drone.\n\nDrone use with a permit is allowed in Iran but there are strict conditions. People must not fly drones over people or large crowds, over the city of Tehran, or over sensitive areas.\n\nAustralia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said \u201cvery sensitive\u201d government negotiations had secured the couple\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cThe ordeal they have been through is now over, they are being reunited with their loved ones.\u201d\n\nPayne said King and Firkin were in good health and good spirits, and had requested privacy.\n\nUniversity of Queensland doctoral research student, Reza Dehbashi Kivi, who has been held in a Brisbane jail on sanctions-busting allegations for 13 months, will not be extradited to the US, the Australian government has confirmed.\n\nThe 38-year-old was arrested in September last year and accused of conspiring to export restricted American-made amplifiers that could be used to detect stealth planes or missiles to Iran.\n\nThe US sought to have him extradited on six charges, including conspiring to export special amplifiers classified on the US munitions list as \u201cdefence articles\u201d, and of \u201caiding and abetting in the exportation of defence articles from the United States to Iran\u201d.\n\nDehbashi Kivi faced up to 20 years in prison. During a failed application for bail, he told the Brisbane magistrates court he was a PhD student researching the development of a machine to detect skin cancers.\n\nIranian state media agency Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (Irib) has reported Dehbashi Kivi returned to Tehran on Saturday.\n\nThe attorney general, Christian Porter, would not comment on whether King and Firkin were released in exchange for Dehbashi Kivi.\n\n\u201cThe Australian government does not comment on the details behind its consideration of particular cases,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAnd while it is likely that because of Mr Dehbashi Kivi\u2019s nationality some will speculate regarding this matter, consistent with prior practice I do not intend to comment further on the particular details of this case, particularly when any such response from me may diminish our government\u2019s capacity to deal with future matters of this type in Australia\u2019s best interests.\u201d\n\nOne Australian remains in prison in Tehran. British-Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert was arrested last year on allegations of spying.\n\nCambridge-educated Moore-Gilbert, a lecturer in Islamic studies at the University of Melbourne\u2019s Asia Institute, has reportedly been tried and convicted of espionage and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nShe is currently being held in Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin prison, and has endured significant periods of solitary confinement. She has had limited consular access from Australian officials and no contact with her family or friends.\n\nMoore-Gilbert\u2019s research has drawn her into areas that could be perceived as sensitive, particularly by an Iranian regime under acute pressure from economic sanctions and deeply suspicious of foreign academics and journalists. She has written extensively about revolutions and activism in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shia Islam, Bahraini politics and its protest movements.\n\nAustralia left with few diplomatic levers after three citizens detained in Iran Read more\n\nAt the time she was arrested she held a grant examining \u201cIran\u2019s relationship with Bahrain\u2019s Shia after the Arab uprisings\u201d. The grant was part of the University of Melbourne\u2019s early career researcher grants scheme.\n\nPayne said \u201cvery long-term negotiations\u201d were taking place to secure the release of Moore-Gilbert, but the minister conceded her situation was \u201cvery complex\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe has been detained for some considerable time, and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced \u2026 we are continuing our discussions with the Iranian government and we do not accept the charges upon which she was convicted and we would seek to have her returned to Australia.\u201d\n\nRelations between Iran and Australia are robust. Australia has maintained diplomatic relations with Tehran through recent decades where other western nations have abandoned them, or they have become acutely strained.\n\nBut in August, the Australian prime minister committed to a US-led mission to patrol the Strait of Hormuz off Iran\u2019s south coast through which about a fifth of the world\u2019s oil passes. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said \u201cdestabilising behaviour\u201d \u2013 a thinly veiled reference to Iran\u2019s capture of foreign-flagged ships \u2013 was a threat to Australian interests.", "description": "Release of Jolie King and Mark Firkin comes as an Iranian doctoral student held in Brisbane avoids extradition to the US", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/947f70c40b25447c1584a3ced12790747ca509dd/0_422_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eada826cfc56f935810311d6ee2a3004", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
