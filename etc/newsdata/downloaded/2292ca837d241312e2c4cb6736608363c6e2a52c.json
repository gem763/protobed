These lifestyle-adjustment companies were so influential that wannabe entrepreneurs saw them as a template, flooding Silicon Valley with \u201cUber for X\u201d pitches.\n\nBut as their promises soared, their profits didn\u2019t. It\u2019s easy to spend all day riding unicorns whose most magical property is their ability to combine high valuations with persistently negative earnings\u2014something I\u2019ve pointed out before. If you wake up on a Casper mattress, work out with a Peloton before breakfast, Uber to your desk at a WeWork, order DoorDash for lunch, take a Lyft home, and get dinner through Postmates, you\u2019ve interacted with seven companies that will collectively lose nearly $14 billion this year. If you use Lime scooters to bop around the city, download Wag to walk your dog, and sign up for Blue Apron to make a meal, that\u2019s three more brands that have never earned a dime or have seen their valuations fall by more than 50 percent.\n\nThese companies don\u2019t give away cold hard cash as blatantly as Seated. But they\u2019re not so different from the restaurant app. To maximize customer growth they have strategically\u2014or at least \u201cstrategically\u201d\u2014throttled their prices, in effect providing a massive consumer subsidy. You might call it the Millennial Lifestyle Sponsorship, in which consumer tech companies, along with their venture-capital backers, help fund the daily habits of their disproportionately young and urban user base. With each Uber ride, WeWork membership, and hand-delivered dinner, the typical consumer has been getting a sweetheart deal.\n\nFor consumers\u2014if not for many beleaguered contract workers\u2014the MLS is a magnificent deal, a capital-to-labor transfer of wealth in pursuit of long-term profit; the sort of thing that might simultaneously please Bernie Sanders and the ghost of Milton Friedman.\n\nBut this was never going to last forever. WeWork\u2019s disastrous IPO attempt has triggered reverberations across the industry. The theme of consumer tech has shifted from magic to margins. Venture capitalists and start-up founders alike have re-embraced an old mantra: Profits matter.\n\nAnd higher profits can only mean one thing: Urban lifestyles are about to get more expensive.\n\nAngie Schmitt: Inequality is slowing cities to a crawl\n\nThe idea that companies like Uber and WeWork and DoorDash don\u2019t make a profit might come as a shock to the many people who spend a fair amount of their take-home pay each month on ride-hailing, shared office space, or meal delivery.\n\nThere is a simple explanation for why they\u2019re not making money. The answer, for finance people, has to do with something called \u201cunit economics.\u201d Normal people should think of it like this: Am I getting ripped off by these companies, or am I kinda-sorta ripping them off? In many cases, the answer is the latter.", "description": "As WeWork crashes and Uber bleeds cash, the consumer-tech gold rush may be coming to an end.", "authors": ["Derek Thompson", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTX6VTVN/facebook.jpg?1570741835", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
