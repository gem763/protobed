(Mark Lennihan)\n\nThe publishing company behind Sports Illustrated laid off 35-40 percent of the publication\u2019s editorial staff Thursday, according to people familiar with the personnel moves, cuts that could decimate what was once the standard-bearer of American sports journalism.\n\nStaffers speaking on condition of anonymity out of concern for reprisal said the job losses are worse than most inside the magazine expected. Even die-hard optimists said morale was at an all-time low given the magazine\u2019s recent struggles, and key managers were not given the opportunity to fight to save some of the organization\u2019s most prized writers.\n\nSports Illustrated employees were invited to two separate \u201ctransition meetings\u201d Thursday, gatherings that were feared to split the magazine into one group that would lose its jobs and another that would not, at noon and 12:30 p.m. But those meetings were canceled moments before they were set to begin, thrusting the 63-year-old publication into even more uncertainty.\n\nHours later, though, the meetings were back on for 4:15 and 4:30 p.m. Staff at the early meeting were dismissed. Those at the later meeting were retained. Many staffers attended the 4:15 meeting in solidarity.\n\nThirty former employees on the print side of the publication will receive severance protection guaranteed through SI\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with the NewsGuild of New York. Guild members are negotiating to extend those benefits to other laid-off staffers, including full-time contractors.\n\nSports Illustrated has been in a state of uncertainty for years after two corporate sales. Publishing conglomerate Meredith bought it from Time Inc., for $1.8 billion in 2017, then immediately put the title back on the market. Authentic Brands Group purchased Sports Illustrated in May for $110 million, a price considered a bargain.\n\nABG is a marketing and brand development company that predominantly licenses brand and trademarks of celebrities such as Marylin Monroe. Because of ABG\u2019s lack of experience running a media company, the deal included a provision that Meredith would continue to run the editorial side of the magazine for two years.\n\nBut less than a month later, ABG cut off that part of the deal and leased Sports Illustrated\u2019s media operations to Seattle-based start-up Maven, a move staffers saw as an immediate threat to the magazine\u2019s future.\n\nMaven almost immediately began staffing changes at Sports Illustrated. Christian Stone, the magazine\u2019s editor in chief of seven years, is leaving, according to a memo released this week. Stone was viewed as an obstacle between widespread cuts due to his long tenure at SI, and his departure earlier this week was greeted by fear and apprehension.\n\nBefore Thursday afternoon\u2019s meetings, a group of Sports Illustrated staffers launched a last-ditch effort calling for Meredith to step back in to halt or ease the layoffs and decrying Maven\u2019s content plans after the staffing changes.\n\n\u201cThe Maven wants to replace top journalists in the industry with a network of Maven freelancers and bloggers, while reducing or eliminating department that have ensured that the stories we publish and produce meet the highest standards,\u201d the group wrote in a statement. \u201c \u2026 These plans significantly undermine our journalistic integrity, damage the reputation of this long-standing brand and negatively affect the economic stability of this publication.\u201d\n\nReached by phone Thursday and asked about the turmoil at SI, ABG chief executive Jamie Salter described the situation at the magazine as \u201cawesome.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can only tell you that we buy troubled companies that we think there\u2019s enormous amount of value in the intellectual property in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re also living in a digital world, and I don\u2019t want to blame anyone because it takes a lot of people to run a business. But it takes a leader to build a business. And at the end of the day whoever has been leading this company for the last seven years, in my opinion, they fell behind.\n\n\u201cABG has been successful because we\u2019re laser-focused on social media, on influencers, on product and design. And we\u2019re laser-focused on localizing product for each market, and we\u2019ve invested the money and resources in those people for those markets.\u201d\n\nAsked about layoffs, he said, \u201cWe have to be smart about it. We have to change some of the soldiers. You need different skill-sets.\u201d\n\nMaven executives have begun recruiting an army of freelancers to replace salaried Sports Illustrated writers, according to multiple people who were contacted and interviewed for the positions.\n\nThe work would be largely devoid of the original reporting that made Sports Illustrated an icon in the American media landscape, those people said, and would use the magazine\u2019s loyal audience to boost Maven\u2019s content.\n\n\u201cWe made a deal,\u201d Salter said. \u201cThey paid their money. Last time I checked, we asked for three years up front, they paid $45 million. I don\u2019t know too many people who will throw $45 million in the garbage.\u201d\n\nSome current Sports Illustrated staffers were unaware of Maven\u2019s content plans and stunned to hear of the specifics second hand from colleagues. Maven recently posted generic job listings, including \u201cmanaging editor,\u201d \u201cpre-editor,\u201d \u201ceditorial lead,\u201d \u201cinsider (reporter),\u201d \u201csport editor\u201d and \u201cexpert writer,\u201d to the surprise of some Sports Illustrated staffers.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nDAZN\u2019s next attempt at buzz: A boxing match between YouTube stars Logan Paul and KSI\n\nAndrew Luck retired young, and was hailed for his courage.
