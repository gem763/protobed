Mike Dunleavy.\n\nThe budget cuts approved by the state Legislature are expected to end winter trips to Cordova by the ferry service beginning Friday.\n\nThere are no roads to the community about 147 miles (237 kilometers) southeast of Anchorage and the ferry typically runs a few times each week during the winter.\n\nOfficials say Cordova, Valdez and the Native village of Tatitlek in Prince William Sound are not expected to receive another ferry until May after this week.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: KSKA-FM, http://www.kska.org\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A coastal Alaska fishing town will soon be cut off from vehicles with the closure of its ferry service due to state budget cuts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
