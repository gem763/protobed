Durand/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nFrench girls, as you know, do everything better: skin care (it\u2019s just a bit of cream), parenting (b\u00e9b\u00e9s have a national child-care system), and weight loss (they simply do not get fat). Naturally, they also have more fun.\n\nAnd when in France, why not do as the French do? It\u2019s perhaps this embrace of a blas\u00e9 French attitude that led a 32-year-old Swiss man to take LSD on a trip to Disneyland Paris, \u00e0 la Lisa Simpson.
