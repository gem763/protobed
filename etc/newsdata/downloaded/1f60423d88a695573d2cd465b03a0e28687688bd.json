His unwillingness to act on that legislation, or on Senate bills, is frustrating to some even in his own party.)\n\nIn a series of tweets Sunday, the president quoted Dallas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, who said during an appearance on Fox News that if Democrats remove Trump from office, \u201cit will cause a Civil War-like fracture in this nation from which this country will never heal.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, the president suggested in a tweet that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who will lead the impeachment investigation, ought to be arrested for treason.\n\nThe penalties for treason include death.\n\nHouse Democrats could vote to impeach the president as soon as this year, but it wouldn\u2019t remove him from office. That would only happen if the Senate subsequently votes to convict Trump of charges laid out in House articles of impeachment. It would take a supermajority to do that, or 67 senators \u2015 meaning 20 Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic Caucus \u2015 which seems unlikely. But McConnell said he would not try to prevent the trial from occurring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll follow the Senate rules,\u201d McConnell said Monday. \u201cI would have no choice but to take it up.\u201d\n\nTrump has also suggested that an intelligence community whistleblower committed treason by using official channels to warn that Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Joe Biden, a top 2020 political rival.\n\nThe whistleblower\u2019s complaint, which says the president \u201cis using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d is corroborated by a White House summary of the president\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy.\n\nOnly a couple of Republicans have dared to say the president is going too far with his rhetoric.\n\n\u201cI have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President,\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) tweeted in response to Trump\u2019s Civil War post. \u201cThis is beyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nLast week, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-Texas) warned about the president\u2019s rhetoric without criticizing him directly.\n\n\u201cThrowing the word \u2018treason\u2019 around is as dangerous has throwing the word \u2018impeachment\u2019 around,\u201d Conaway told HuffPost.", "description": "The president also is throwing the word \"treason\" around a lot.
