REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nThe bank will offer daily repurchase agreement, or repo, operations, offering at least $75 billion a day in daily cash injections through Nov. 4. The Fed also announced term repos for firms wanting to borrow cash for longer, with most offerings lasting two weeks. This extends a policy that was initially supposed to end next week.\n\nThe continuation of the daily repo operations ensures that financial firms will be able to turn to the central bank to borrow cash until at least the next Fed meeting, when policymakers are expected to discuss a more permanent solution.\n\nThe New York Fed began holding daily repo operations on Sept. 17, after a key borrowing rate in overnight lending markets for cash spiked to 10%. The central bank succeeded in calming markets through the operations, but some investors and former Fed officials have been calling on the central bank to deliver a long-term fix.\n\nSome investors say the Fed should permanently increase liquidity in the banking system by expanding the size of the balance sheet or introducing a standing repo facility, which would allow firms to borrow cash as needed at a fixed rate.\n\nShahid Ladha, head of strategy for G10 rates Americas at BNP Paribas, called the extension of the repo operations a \u201cpositive\u201d move, but said a structural change is needed. He estimates the Fed needs to increase reserves by close to $400 billion over the next year to avoid scarcity issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging, but again this remains a temporary liquidity operation,\u201d Ladha said. \u201cIt\u2019s still not enough.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Thursday that officials would revisit the possibility of creating a standing repo facility, which was discussed in the June meeting, during future meetings. Clarida also said officials would be discussing in October whether it is time to grow the Fed\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThe pre-emptive action from the New York Fed could help minimize market volatility in the near term because firms now know they can turn to the central bank if they need liquidity, said Blake Gwinn, head of front-end rates strategy for NatWest Markets. \u201cIt\u2019s a full fledged lean into providing repo liquidity through these temporary operations,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Gwinn said a more dramatic intervention might be needed to ensure there are no wide swings in repo rates near the end of the year. That is when banks may adjust their reserves for regulatory reasons, and a deadline for quarterly tax payments could create fresh liquidity problems.\n\nGwinn said a little movement in repo rates might not be problematic, however, as long as a repeat of the 10% rate seen last month is avoided.\n\n\u201cBefore the crisis we had repo volatility,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t unknown and it wasn\u2019t scary. People dealt with it.\u201d", "description": "The New York Federal Reserve will continue to boost liquidity in money markets into November, the bank announced on Friday.", "authors": ["Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437207930&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF94001", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
