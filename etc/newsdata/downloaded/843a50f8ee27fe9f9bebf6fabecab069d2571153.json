(AP) - LSU quarterback Joe Burrow portrays himself as a morning person.\n\nThat\u2019ll help on Saturday, when the No 5. Tigers (4-0) kickoff against Utah State (3-1) at 11 a.m. local time to accommodate network television.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really like sitting in my room waiting for my games,\u201d Burrow said when asked if he would have preferred the traditional night start in Death Valley. \u201cI like getting up at 7, 8, eating breakfast and going to play.\u201d\n\nLSU\u2019s pervious game - at Vanderbilt - also had a late-morning kickoff and was the first daytime kickoff for the Tigers this season. Burrow responded by setting a single-game LSU record with six touchdown passes to go with 398 yards passing in a 68-38 victory .\n\nIt also sounds like Burrow has been getting restless after the Tigers got last weekend off.\n\n\u201cI thought would like watching games (last) Saturday, but it\u2019s a lot less fun when you\u2019re sitting on the couch,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course that would be the case for Burrow, who leads an offense that could break all kinds of school records. Burrow already has 100 completions for 1,520 yards and 17 TDs this season, and LSU has scored at least 45 points in each of its first four games for the first time.\n\nUtah State coach Gary Andersen can appreciate an effective spread offense. That\u2019s what he\u2019s running at Utah State, and he sounds impressed with how Burrow and Co. have flourished in a similar system.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re throwing that film on and basically, the offense starts the game and all of sudden it\u2019s like 35-0,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cThey score awful fast. You have to be able to, hopefully, find a way to try and confuse the quarterback a little bit. He\u2019s a very talented player.\u201d\n\nUtah State has won three straight since losing its opener to still-unbeaten Wake Forest in a 38-35 thriller. But odds makers are still listing the Tigers as more than three-touchdown favorites.\n\nHere\u2019s a few other story lines surrounding the Aggies\u2019 first visit to Tiger Stadium since 2001:\n\nHOT TEAMS\n\nThe forecast, which calls for mostly sunny skies and a high of 93 degrees, could be a factor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to practice in 50-degree weather all week long,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cThen we\u2019re flying to Louisiana with the heat and high humidity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be our challenge - making sure to stay hydrated. We may be used to the heat in August, but we\u2019re not now.\u201d\n\nPass-rushing outside linebacker K\u2019Lavon Chaisson said he\u2019s curious to see how the Aggies\u2019 up-tempo offense handles the heat.\n\n\u201cThis is our environment,\u201d Chaisson said. \u201cI feel like they\u2019ll start slowing it down if they can\u2019t handle it.\u201d\n\nRED ZONE EFFICIENCY\n\nLSU\u2019s offense has scored on all 27 possessions that advanced inside opponents\u2019 20-yard line, with 22 TDs and five field goals.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the top two or three things we wanted to improve on this year,\u201d Burrow said, noting that while LSU\u2019s red zone efficiency was good last season, the Tigers too often kicked field goals. \u201cWe\u2019ve changed our mindset that we\u2019re going to go for seven.\u201d\n\nCONNECTIONS\n\nLSU defensive coordinator Dave Aranda, secondary coach Corey Raymond and safeties coach Bill Busch all previously coached at Utah State under Andersen, who began his second stint as Aggies head coach this year. Aranda also left with Andersen to be his defensive coordinator at Wisconsin in 2013.\n\nLOVE TRAIN\n\nLed by QB Jordan Love, Utah State\u2019s offense has been averaging 533 yards and 38.5 points per game. Love was intercepted twice last week by Colorado State, but in rainy, windy weather. Love also completed touchdown passes of 37 and 40 yards to help the Aggies top the Rams 34-24 .\n\n\u201cJordan is our guy, and as he goes, we go,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like that, especially with the type of offense we run.\u201d\n\nHANDS UP\n\nLSU hoped to have more than its 11 sacks through four games. Outside linebacker Andre Anthony, who has one sack, said it\u2019s apparent opposing quarterbacks are making a point to not hold the ball for long. He expects to see more of the same this weekend from Utah State\u2019s Love, unless the QB chooses to run, as he did 11 times last week.\n\n\u201cEverybody is looking and wondering where our pass rush is, but the ball is getting out so fast,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got get a hand in his face and slow them down somehow.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "LSU quarterback Joe Burrow portrays himself as a morning person.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/lsu_vanderbilt_football_61551_c0-188-5277-3264_s1770x1032.jpg?ed88eabde9296d4c42b91a8ce3db4dad875bedfe", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
