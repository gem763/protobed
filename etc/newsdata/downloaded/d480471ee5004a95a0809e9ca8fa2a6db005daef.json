Players are now discovering powerful builds because of this as one of them involves the Titan\u2019s Exotic leg armor \u2013 Peregrine Greaves. Also, the developer recently took to their social media channels to address some stuff about today\u2019s World First race.\n\nPeregrine Greaves + One-Two Punch\n\nTitan mains may have been waiting for this day to arrive as the Peregrine Greaves is now procing with the One-Two Punch perk.\n\nAccording to \"D2\" YouTuber Aztecross Gaming, there are shotguns in the game that has the said perk where it grants players with increased melee damage for a short duration provided that they hit an enemy with every pellet in a shot. Now, imagine pairing that with the leg armor\u2019s Intrinsic perk which is Peregrine Strike. Per its description, all shoulder charge abilities \u2013 Seismic Strike, Hammer Strike, and Shield Bash deal bonus damage when these are activated mid-air.\n\nNow that such mash-up is now possible in the game, Titans can now shoot their shotties in the air and perform a shoulder charge. Prior to these changes, players will have to do a slide, shoot their shotguns, before proceeding to do a shoulder charge.\n\nHe recently uploaded a video about this and compared it to other weapons in the game while playing in PvE. In the video, both Deathbringer and Izanagi\u2019s Burden did pack quite a wallop against poor Greg (Golmuut), but none of those two came close to the greaves\u2019 damage output, not to mention that it does not include the shotgun\u2019s damage.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the latest news!

Video Game\n\nThat said, the YouTuber went on predicting that today\u2019s World First race in the Garden of Salvation raid might consist of teams of Titans donning the said loadout. However, this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\n\nBungie may well seem to be aware of what Aztecross calls \u201cborderline broken\u201d loadout as they\u2019ve addressed it on their recent tweet. According to them, the Peregrine Greaves, alongside the Hunter\u2019s Sealed Ahamkara Grasps and J\u00f6tunn will be disabled game-wide for 24 hours after the launch of the Garden of Salvation raid.\n\nThe following items will be disabled game-wide for 24 hours after the launch of the Garden of Salvation raid on 10/5 at 10AM PDT.\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udca0 J\u00f6tunn\n\n\ud83d\udca0 Sealed Ahamkara Grasps\n\n\ud83d\udca0 Peregrine Greaves pic.twitter.com/UZUXC2Tpc9 \u2014 Bungie (@Bungie) October 4, 2019\n\nThe J\u00f6tunn\n\nThe J\u00f6tunn, on the other hand, was previously discovered to contain a bug making it one of the most broken items in \u201cDestiny 2.\u201d Some players who pointed out, however, that the issue has been with the weapon for quite a while now and this is the only time that it went mainstream.\n\nThe Exotic\u2019s bug is very much evident when a Guardian fires it towards an enemy so close that they too get hit. This, for some reason, makes J\u00f6tunn\u2019s damage way too powerful. This prompted \u201cDestiny 2\u201d Game Director Luke Smith to announce back in September that the overpowered toaster will be disabled from the Garden of Salvation raid adding that the dev team has already identified the issue with the weapon and will be rolling out a fix in future updates.", "description": "'Destiny 2' players might be using their Titans more often now that the combo is possible in the game.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Asmir Pekmic", "Oliver Vandervoort", "Ramon Sanchez", "Read More On The Same Topic E.
