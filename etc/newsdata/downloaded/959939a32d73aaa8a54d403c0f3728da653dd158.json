If the OPPO Reno 2 is anything to go by, it won\u2019t have to march very far, thanks to a flagship handset that exquisitely balances poise with performance to create a great-value all-rounder.\n\nThe Reno 2 is primarily a marriage of style and substance. Under the hood, you\u2019ll find everything you\u2019d expect from an upper-midrange flagship phone, which is augmented by design elements that elevate this handset spectacularly. These include a selfie-camera that\u2019s hidden within the body of the phone, plus a polished Android experience courtesy of Color OS 6.1.\n\nUnder the hood\n\nBefore we delve into the phone itself, let\u2019s chat about the hardware that powers this handset. It\u2019s a bit of a weird one. Some specs are unambiguously high-end, like the phone\u2019s four-camera constellation, or the generous amount of RAM it includes. But there are also a couple of compromises along the way. These push the Reno 2 out of the high-end sphere into what you\u2019d reasonably consider to be an upper-midrange handset.\n\nBefore we find ourselves too deep in the technical weeds, let\u2019s talk about what the Reno 2 is packing:\n\nQualcomm Snapdragon 730G platform\n\nAdreno 618 GPU\n\n8GB RAM\n\n128GB/256GB ROM\n\n48MP main camera (with 13MP telephoto, 8MP ultrawide, and 2MP monochrome)\n\n16MP front-facing camera\n\n6.5-inch full-body AMOLED display (1080 x 2400, 401ppi)\n\nUSB-C\n\nAndroid 9.0 (running ColorOS 6.1)\n\nPerhaps the most eye-catching thing here is the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s mid-range silicon. In fairness, the 730G is no slouch. It uses an 8nm manufacturing process, which offers improved battery life and performance. It also features visible improvements in the chipset\u2019s ability to handle AI tasks, as well as support for Wi-Fi 6.\n\nSleek in all the right places\n\nDespite a heavy marketing push (this year alone, OPPO sponsored the UK Cricket World Cup, as well as the Wimbledon tennis tournament), OPPO isn\u2019t quite yet a household name in the West. Could the Reno 2 be the device that raises its profile into the stratosphere?\n\nI want to think so, and if it happens, it\u2019ll be because OPPO has created a fundamentally aspirational device in the Reno 2.\n\nThe front of the phone is an unbroken panel of screen, with no cameras or notches to intrude. The display is bright and crisp, with excellent viewing angles and faithful color reproduction.\n\nBlack tones are precise and well-defined, whites are bright and perfect, while the rest of the color gamut is expressive and lovely. These attributes make the handset well-suited for long Netflix binges, and the vibrancy of the screen allows you to effortlessly immerse yourself in shows like Planet Earth and Blue Planet.\n\nAt the bottom of the device, you\u2019ll find the USB-C charging port, as well as a solitary speaker and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The latter is particularly welcome, especially given that in 2019, headphone sockets are somewhat of an endangered species. The speaker, while not the loudest we\u2019ve ever heard, is adequate, with little distortion and solid clarity.\n\nThe rear of the device is understated. Unlike the iPhone 11 and Huawei P30 Pro, the constellation of cameras is buried within the device, giving it a very flat profile. The solitary splash of color comes from a strip of blue surrounding the OPPO logo.\n\nAnd then we get to the software. On the Reno 2, OPPO bundles Android 9.0 Pie with its own skin, called Color OS 6.1. I\u2019m usually cynical about third-party skins because they quite often get in the way of the default Android experience, which has improved markedly over the past decade or so.\n\nThat said, Color OS 6.1 isn\u2019t too bad, offering a reasonably uncluttered experience, with buttery-smooth animations. My biggest complaint is the level of pre-installed software that comes with the device, which feels overwhelming. The unit provided to TNW came with OPPO\u2019s app store, a theme marketplace, the Opera web browser, and several random social media apps, including WeSing and Soloop.\n\nSnapping happy\n\nThe standout feature of the OPPO Reno 2 is undoubtedly the camera, which produces detailed and vibrant shots, even under challenging conditions. The camera app itself is somewhat pared back, especially compared to Huawei\u2019s offering, which heavily emphasizes the bells and whistles.\n\nThe portrait mode on the Reno 2 is one of the best I\u2019ve used so far. It\u2019s capable of producing some gorgeously soft backgrounds, while still ensuring that the subject of the photo looks sharp and defined, with accurate skin tones and plenty of detail.\n\nThe Reno 2 is also excellent at photographing the world around you, capturing images with exquisite detail and vibrancy. Although the camera app does occasionally optimize settings based on the subject (like, for example, taking a photo of a plate of spaghetti will get the Reno 2\u2019s camera to switch to \u201cfood\u201d mode), the AI optimizations are less intrusive than those offered by Huawei.\n\nThe front-facing camera pops up on a mechanical \u201cpizza slice.\u201d While I couldn\u2019t fault the overall quality, my biggest qualm was with the fact that it takes a second or so for it to get into place, which makes it a tricky proposition for those pictures where spontaneity is the order of the day.\n\nWho is the OPPO Reno 2 for?\n\nThe OPPO Reno 2 is a great phone and ticks the majority of most people\u2019s boxes. It has an excellent camera, which performs well during daylight and nighttime. It\u2019s stylish and well-built. The front-facing camera, while slightly gimmicky, takes beautiful shots. The screen is vibrant and bright, and Color OS 6.1 is genuinely pleasant to use.\n\nUltimately, this is an excellent handset, and serves as a worthy alternative more expensive Android flagship devices, like the Huawei Mate 30 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S10.\n\nOPPO will launch the Reno 2 in Europe next week, when we\u2019ll learn more about its UK and Eurozone pricing. It\u2019s already on sale in India, where the top-tier model retails for 39,990 INR. We\u2019d guess this handset will retail around the \u00a3500/\u20ac550 mark.\n\nKeep an eye out for our full review later this month, where we\u2019ll take a closer look at this excellent phone.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "The Oppo Reno 2 is all polish and poise", "authors": ["Matthew Hughes", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FDSC_0361-Cropped.jpg&signature=d83f3eaee558a932c11c9b93dfef9944", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
