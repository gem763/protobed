It has been unclear if the election would go ahead, but the letter warned against the suggestion that the polling should be delayed if a deal with the US paves the way for inter-Afghan talks.\n\n\u201cAfghans deserve to determine their government and who will represent them in peace negotiations. For this to happen, there is a strong argument that presidential elections planned for September should go forward,\u201d the ambassadors wrote.\n\nBetween them, the signatories have 12 years of experience at the US embassy in Kabul over the past two decades. They also include John Negroponte, the former deputy secretary of state and the first ever US director of national intelligence.\n\nOnly four ambassadors from the period since the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent US-backed removal of the Taliban government are missing from the list of signatories. One of them is the incumbent, and the other is the lead US envoy to peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.\n\nAfter a year of negotiations, Khalilzad has reached a draft deal with the Taliban for a US troop withdrawal. But Afghan officials were excluded from the talks, and the draft deal was only shown to President Ashraf Ghani this week.\n\nThat decision, driven by the Taliban\u2019s refusal to speak to officials they denounce as \u201cpuppets\u201d, was unwise and damaging to the Afghan government, the ambassadors said. \u201cWhether or not the United States wants or is willing to keep some forces engaged, we should not undercut the legitimate government in Afghanistan by keeping them out of negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe draft withdrawal deal also does not define how Afghanistan should be governed once American troops have gone. Critics say that could set the stage for an intensified civil war.\n\nAlthough US support has been critical to Afghan security forces, they are still several hundred thousand strong and backed up by militia which have been fighting the Taliban since before US troops first arrived. Most are likely to have a strong incentive to keep on fighting.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s \u2018peace agreement\u2019 is a betrayal of Afghanistan and its people | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\n\u201cThere is an outcome far worse than the status quo, namely a return to the total civil war that consumed Afghanistan as badly as the war with the Russians, and something that could follow a breakdown in negotiations if we remove too much support from the Afghan state,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIf the state totters, those with nasty memories of life under the Taliban will fight on.\u201d\n\nThe deal would allow for an initial drawdown of nearly 5,000 US troops. In an interview with Afghanistan\u2019s Tolo TV, Khalilzad declined to stay how long the remaining 8,500 troops could stay, but previous reports have suggested it would be well under two years.\n\nIn return, the Taliban will guarantee that the country will not be used by al-Qaida or other extremist groups as a base for attacks on the west. Critics question how that will be enforced if the US no longer has a military presence on the ground.\n\nThe agreement must be approved by Donald Trump before it can be signed, but the president has made little secret of his desire to extricate the US from its longest war as soon as possible.", "description": "Nine ambassadors condemn US approach to negotiations and say full troop withdrawal must come \u2018only after a real peace\u2019", "authors": ["Emma Graham-Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ccfac7977987190eed76ae244f306700ec649b3/0_165_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=192eb74d20856b7270b5bd6d2fef35c0"}
