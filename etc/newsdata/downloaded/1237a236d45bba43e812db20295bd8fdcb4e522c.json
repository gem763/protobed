The Ramos Arizpe facility is located in the Mexican border state of Coahuila, just south of Texas.\n\nAll of the plants located at GM\u2019s Silao facility, in central Guanajuato state, will restart on Monday.\n\nThousands of Silao workers had been furloughed as anxiety grew earlier this month among residents who viewed the facility as the city\u2019s economic anchor.\n\nTensions over the future of manufacturing in North America were at the heart of the striking GM workers. The debate pitted U.S. labor advocates eager to reduce Mexico\u2019s cost advantage against Mexican trade unions fighting to protect local jobs.\n\nThe strike began in September with UAW negotiators demanding higher pay for workers, greater job security as well as a bigger share of profits and the protection of healthcare benefits.", "description": "General Motors Co will gradually restart operations at several idled plants in Mexico beginning this weekend, after unionized workers for the U.S. automaker ratified a new labor contract, the company's Mexican unit said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
