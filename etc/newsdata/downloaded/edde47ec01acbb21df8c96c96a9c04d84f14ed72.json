Investigators said on Wednesday that the third suspect, 22-year-old Thaddeous Green, (right) remains at large\n\nDallas Police revealed the identities of the three suspects on Tuesday as they insisted the killing was not tied in any way to Brown's testimony during Guyger's recent murder trial.\n\nBrown was gunned down just two days after the Dallas cop was sentenced to 10 years in prison for shooting dead her neighbor Botham Jean in his own apartment.\n\nHis murder prompted widespread speculation on the 'suspicious' timing of his death as Brown's family demanded the Dallas Police Department hand over the investigation to an alternate agency to ensure a 'trustworthy' investigation.\n\nIt is not yet why the three men drove more than 300 miles - or 4.5 hours - from central Louisiana to buy marijuana in Texas.\n\nPolice said the three suspects in Brown's murder drove to meet him outside a Dallas apartment block last Friday night to buy drugs from him.\n\nGreen had allegedly been the one to contact Brown about the drugs but police said a physical altercation broke out between them when they met.\n\nJacquerious told investigators that he got out of the car when the fight broke out but he was shot in the chest by Brown.\n\nHe said Green retaliated and allegedly shot Brown twice in the lower body.\n\nPolice said the three men then fled the scene in their car. Michael, who was the driver, allegedly dropped Green at an unknown location before rushing Jacquerious to hospital to be treated for his gunshot wound.\n\nPolice said Michael then also fled. Green allegedly took Brown's backpack and gun from the scene of the shooting.\n\nInvestigators said they received multiple tips to search Brown's apartment where they uncovered 12 pounds of marijuana and about $4,000 in cash.\n\nThe three men will face capital murder charges in Joshua Brown's slaying after he was shot dead last Friday during a botched drug deal just days after he testified during Amber Guyger's murder trial\n\nAmber Guyger (left) was found guilty last week and sentenced to 10 years in prison for the September 2018 murder of her upstairs neighbor Botham Jean (right)\n\nWitnesses reported hearing several gunshots and saw a silver sedan speeding out of the apartment complex's parking lot shortly after the shooting.\n\nPolice said they have since learned a silver car believed to be driven by the suspects was rented in Alexandria, Louisiana on Friday. Investigators said the vehicle was returned on Sunday.\n\nBrown has previously served time for a drug and firearms conviction and has a history of drug charges, DailyMail.com has learned.\n\nFollowing his death, police said they found 12 pounds of marijuana and $4,000 cash in his apartment.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department have vowed to be 'transparent' about Brown's case and provide updates when available.\n\nIt comes after police were heavily criticized over their handling of the Guyger case with many claiming the investigation was corrupt.\n\nDuring the killer cop's trial, jurors were shown footage of Guyger using her cellphone after the shooting instead of giving aid, body cameras being turned off and evidence that text messages had been deleted off her phone.\n\nBrown's family issued a statement via their attorney Lee Merritt calling for the Dallas Police Department to turn over the investigation to an alternate agency.\n\n'This family and their representatives have consciously avoided speculating about law enforcement involvement in this tragedy, however, due to the proximity of this murder with the trial of Amber Guyger - rumors abound.\n\nDallas Police Assistant Chief Avery Moore said the killing was not tied in any way to Brown testifying at Guyger's murder trial. Since news of Brown's murder broke, speculation has been rife about the timing of his death. Many have suggested police had a hand in Brown's murder\n\n'It will be nearly impossible to conduct a reliable investigation in a climate where the investigating agency has been implicated in the murder itself.\n\n'That implication naturally stems from a trial where a Dallas Police officer was convicted of murder and other DPD officers were shown to have participated in condemnable behavior in destroying evidence and interfering with the investigation.'\n\nMerritt had earlier said Brown was due to be one of the first witnesses to testify in an upcoming wrongful death lawsuit brought against the Dallas Police Department by Jean's family.\n\nJean's family is suing the city after claiming that police failed to properly train Guyger before she shot him dead in his own apartment.\n\nMerritt said he was reluctant to testify during Guyger's high-profile trial and had repeatedly expressed concerns for his safety.\n\nBrown had narrowly escaped death in November last year following a shooting outside a Dallas nightclub. He was shot in the foot and his 25-year-old friend was killed.\n\nMerritt has previously said Brown feared the people behind the shooting continued to mean him harm.\n\nHe said Brown fled Texas for California to avoid testifying at Guyger's trial.\n\nMerritt said Brown was in California on the first of Guyger's trial but that prosecutors allegedly threatened to issue a warrant for his arrest if he didn't show up the following day.\n\nSince news of Brown's murder broke, speculation has been rife about the timing of his death. Many have suggested the Dallas Police Department had a hand in Brown's murder\n\nBrown was shot in the parking lot of the Atera apartment complex (above) in Dallas's upscale Medical District at about 10.30pm on Friday\n\n'He got on a plane and came straight from the airport to the courthouse,' Merritt said. 'I believe he met with the judge in her chambers (on the record) and reiterated his concern about testifying.'\n\nBrown took to the stand wearing a Dragon Ball Z t-shirt and shorts.\n\nHe went on to testify that he heard two gunshots and a commotion in the hallway the night Guyger shot dead Jean.\n\nBrown started crying when he was asked about the victim.\n\nHe said he had met Jean for the first time on the day he was killed when police knocked on both of their doors about a noise complaint, even though there wasn't anything loud going on in their apartments.\n\nBrown said he thought it might have been because both he and Jean smoked marijuana and the smell sometimes drifted into the hallway.\n\nMerritt pointed out that the court has mechanisms to limit the exposure of witnesses and more should have been done to protect Brown given his concerns.\n\n'(The court) took steps to cut off cameras and instruct media not to report on an undercover cop that testified in Guyger's trial,' Merritt said.\n\n'Why weren't the same measures taken to protect Joshua Brown? Brown's testimony was powerful but it was also duplicative. Nothing he testified to couldn't have been brought in by other witnesses.\n\n'It wasn't worth his life.'\n\nMerritt has previously called Brown's death an 'assassination'.", "description": "Jacquerious Mitchell, 20, is in police custody in a Dallas hospital\u00a0after he was injured in a gunfire exchange with Joshua Brown when he and two others tried to buy drugs off him last Friday night.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/16/19497068-0-image-a-32_1570634975630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
