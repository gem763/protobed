It now appears to be live again as of 8PM ET on August 29th. But even during the time Tesla\u2019s insurance site was working and offering owners quotes, some people weren\u2019t happy with the results.\n\nThe problem with starting up a whole new part of your business is... you have to start up a whole new part of your business\n\nTesla tells The Verge those two things are actually related; the company says it found \u201cbugs\u201d that were affecting some customers\u2019 rate quotes, but it declined to offer any specifics beyond that. The company said it will get the website back up as soon as that\u2019s resolved, without saying when that resolution might be. We found it had gone live again as of this evening.\n\nTesla\u2019s insurance mini-site launched around 3PM ET on Wednesday, but users reported trouble accessing the site within just a few hours. At 6:49PM ET, the company tweeted it was \u201cmaking some updates to Tesla Insurance\u201d and that the service would \u201cbe back online shortly.\u201d Seventeen minutes later, the company tweeted again that there was an \u201cAlgorithm update in progress.\u201d That same language also shows up if you try to click on the link that originally took people to the Tesla Insurance mini-site.\n\nBoth the Tesla Motors subreddit and the company\u2019s owner forums are littered with posts from people who claim they received quotes that were higher than expected. That appears to have disappointed some owners since the company promised rates that were up to 20 percent lower than the competition. (However, most of those irked owners didn\u2019t provide evidence of the comparisons they were complaining about.)\n\nThe insurance offering may give Tesla a way to create bigger margins with a product that doesn\u2019t require as much money to set up as the process of designing and manufacturing cars. But the problem with starting up a whole new part of your business is... you have to start up a whole new part of your business. And sometimes, new things break.\n\nUpdate, 8:20PM ET: Added that Tesla Insurance\u2019s site appears to be live again.", "description": "Just a few hours after Tesla launched its in-house car insurance product in California on Wednesday, the company stopped offering rate quotes and suspended access to the insurance website.
