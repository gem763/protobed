REUTERS/Brian Snyder/\n\nAmazon is dropping its $14.99 delivery fee as Walmart - the No. 1 grocery seller in the United States - rolls out a $98 annual \u201cDelivery Unlimited\u201d grocery membership to compete with Amazon\u2019s $119 Prime delivery subscription.\n\nAmazon has fat profits from its Web Services business and has demonstrated a willingness to lose money on initiatives aimed at driving more customers to its sprawling online marketplace.\n\nChief Executive Brian Olsavsky last week said \u201cforegone shipping revenue\u201d - or money Amazon would otherwise have brought in from customers who once paid for fast delivery - would contribute to a spike in Amazon shipping costs that some expect to top $11 billion in the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI think that this is going to be a game changer, and it will grow into one of the most loved benefits of Prime,\u201d Stephenie Landry, Amazon\u2019s vice president of grocery delivery, said.\n\nAmazon said in 2017 it was ending its Fresh grocery delivery service for select areas. Landry, however, said the business is growing and has expanded this year to areas like Nashville, Orlando and Las Vegas.\n\nAmazon last week forecast revenue and profit below Wall Street\u2019s target, amid intense competition and surging costs related to its drive to speed up shipping times around the world.\n\nSales at Amazon\u2019s Whole Foods Market chain and other physical stores stalled in the second quarter and fell 1 percent in the third quarter.\n\nProfits from grocery sales are notoriously slim. But selling staples like bananas, milk and toilet paper gives retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target Corp the opportunity to upsell shoppers who make frequent visits to replenish such necessities.\n\nTuesday\u2019s move from the world\u2019s biggest online retailer is yet another salvo in the continuing delivery \u201carms race,\u201d Charlie O\u2019Shea of Moody\u2019s said.\n\nAmazon is already cutting delivery times to one day for its Prime loyalty members in a bid to outmaneuver Walmart and other retailers who offer competing two-day shipping without subscription fees.\n\n\u201cThis new delivery effort is yet another example of Amazon\u2019s willingness to suffer short-term for the potential for long-term benefit,\u201d O\u2019Shea added.\n\nShares in Amazon slipped 0.6% in afternoon trading, while Kroger Co and Walmart were down 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively.\n\nWalmart plans to offer its \u201cDelivery Unlimited\u201d grocery membership to shoppers in more than half of the United States by the end of the year. Members have the option of paying the $98 annual fee or $12.95 per month instead of the usual $9.99 delivery fee.\n\nKroger charges a $5.95 delivery fee and a $6.00 service fee to drop groceries at shopper doorsteps.\n\nA recent study from Capgemini found that 38% of U.S. consumers order groceries online, but that only 14% were willing to pay more for two-hour deliveries.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc is eliminating its grocery delivery charge for Prime members in the United States and making shopping easier by combining AmazonFresh and Whole Foods Market ordering on a single site, as it battles rival grocery sellers like Walmart Inc and Kroger Co.", "authors": ["Akanksha Rana", "Jeffrey Dastin", "Lisa Baertlein", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446265161&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S1ND-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
