People who know me or who have worked with me know that I am not someone who would intentionally harm, offend, or embarrass anyone.\u201d\n\nHowever, a singer who worked with Domingo in the Washington Opera\u2019s 1999-2000 season has now accused him of sexually assaulting her.\n\nAngela Turner Wilson, 48, told AP that while she had been aware of Domingo\u2019s reputation for inappropriate behaviour, she had wanted to believe his interest in her was professional when he began sitting by her and telling her he adored her.\n\nBut one evening before a performance, she said, Domingo slipped his hands under her bra straps then reached down into her robe and grabbed her bare breast. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d she told AP. \u201cIt was not gentle. He groped me hard.\u201d\n\nWilson said she had been motivated to come forward by Domingo\u2019s reaction to the allegations and his suggestion that \u201cthe rules and standards by which we are and should be measured against today are very different than they were in the past\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat woman would ever want him to grab their breast? And it hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I had to go on stage and act like I was in love with him.\u201d\n\nThe AP reported that several backstage employees told it that they strove to shield young women from the star as administrators looked the other way, suggesting Domingo\u2019s behaviour was an open secret in the industry.\n\nOne woman has accused Domingo of putting his hand down her skirt and three others said he forced kisses on their lips in a dressing room, hotel room and at a lunch meeting.\n\nA spokeswoman for Domingo accused AP of conducting an \u201cinaccurate [and] unethical\u201d campaign against the singer.\n\nShe added: \u201cThese new claims are riddled with inconsistencies and, as with the first story, in many ways, simply incorrect.\n\n\u201cDue to an ongoing investigation, we will not comment on specifics, but we strongly dispute the misleading picture that the AP is attempting to paint of Mr Domingo.\u201d", "description": "One woman claims Spanish opera singer groped her so hard she cried out in pain", "authors": ["Sam Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d7eac1f60edc48d942834dd518e3325e625abd6/0_144_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=274d0732240e85d0cb9d8a7d9b4c9c2a", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
