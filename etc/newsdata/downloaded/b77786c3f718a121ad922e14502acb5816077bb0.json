REUTERS/Amy Tennery\n\nInterest in the sport has increased thanks to the U.S. national team\u2019s record-extending fourth World Cup victory, a lawsuit against the governing body for gender discrimination and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on the horizon.\n\nThe prominence on the international stage has been a boon to the NWSL, where average attendances were around 7,300 during the 2019 season, up from around 5,000 in 2015, the last year the U.S. won the World Cup.\n\nNWSL President Amanda Duffy told Reuters while the league struggled to retain new fans after the 2015 World Cup, a stronger ownership group better integrated in local markets would help make the difference this time around.\n\n\u201cThis year was different and it was elevated above what I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Duffy. \u201cThe (U.S.) team resonated with fans in a completely new way on top of how they already had that relationship and support from fans.\u201d\n\nWorld Cup success coincided with added momentum on the business side, with ESPN signing a deal with the league in July to televise matches on its networks and Budweiser signing on as the NWSL\u2019s first official beer sponsor.\n\nBudweiser launched a promotion ahead of the NWSL championship aimed at bringing in other sponsors, with a series of tweets featuring Reign FC\u2019s Megan Rapinoe.\n\n\u201cThis year, the fans of the @NWSL have shown the world they #WontStopWatching,\u201d one tweet reads. \u201cBut, today, we\u2019re calling for more brands to join those fans in the stands.\u201d\n\nIndustry experts said the conditions surrounding the league, which this month announced an expansion franchise in Louisville, Kentucky, were ideal for growth.\n\n\u201cThe timing is right for the NWSL, and the product is definitely sustainable,\u201d said Bob Dorfman, creative director at Baker Street Advertising.\n\n\u201cWorld Cup momentum will continue to build through the 2020 Olympics, and with new stars emerging, a young, loyal fanbase growing, and solid marketing and sponsorship support behind it all, the league should be able to thrive.\u201d\n\nThe surging popularity of the women\u2019s game is also being seen outside the United States, with England set for a record sell-out crowd at Wembley Stadium next month in their match against Germany.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s companies that have kind of jumped on board and rode this wave of excitement with women\u2019s soccer,\u201d said U.S. and Courage defender Abby Dahlkemper.\n\n\u201cI think the quality of this league, the World Cup tournament, the quality of soccer being played is the highest level it\u2019s ever been played.\u201d", "description": "The North Carolina Courage thrashed the Chicago Red Stars for a second consecutive NWSL championship on Sunday, capping a significant year of change for women's soccer in the United States.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445643264&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0UX", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
