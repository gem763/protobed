North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, the president said, \u201cwanted nothing to do with\u201d him during diplomatic talks over the past 17 months.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Kim Jong Un,\u201d he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks on Wednesday revealed lingering resentment that, in his view, Bolton had threatened to derail the United States\u2019 historic first summit with Kim last year by taking an unnecessarily provocative position in suggesting that Pyongyang must follow the \u201cLibya model\u201d and relinquish all of its nuclear weapons under any prospective deal.\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to publicly side with Kim over a recently departed senior aide marked the latest in a string of extraordinary episodes in which he has aligned himself with one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators against individual Americans, the intelligence community, the military and U.S. allies.\n\nSince the second U.S.-North Korea summit in Hanoi in February collapsed without a deal, Trump has sought to rekindle dormant bilateral negotiations by flattering Kim \u2014 but also by offering him political cover on a list of provocations that cut against U.S. interests.\n\nThis summer alone, the president has:\n\n\n\nPresident Trump meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 30 at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Panmunjom, South Korea. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)\n\n\u25cfReiterated his belief that joint U.S.-South Korea military drills are \u201cridiculous and expensive\u201d \u2014 this time after receiving a personal letter from Kim complaining about the exercises.\n\n\u25cfDeclared that the North\u2019s testing of short-range missiles did not violate an agreement with Kim, prompting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to call the tests a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\n\n\u25cfEndorsed, while on a state visit to Tokyo, North Korean state media\u2019s mockery of former vice president Joe Biden as a \u201cfool of low IQ,\u201d saying he agreed.\n\n\u25cfStated that he would not have authorized using Kim\u2019s family members as spies against the regime amid reports that the CIA had cultivated the dictator\u2019s half brother as an intelligence asset. (Kim Jong Nam was assassinated in Malaysia in 2017, at the North Korean leader\u2019s direction, according to South Korea\u2019s spy agency.)\n\nFormer U.S. officials said Trump\u2019s approach with Kim fits his pattern of trying to maintain good personal relationships with hostile foreign leaders in hope that it will pay off at the negotiating table. Yet they emphasized that the strategy has not led to breakthroughs on Trump\u2019s biggest foreign policy initiatives, including an effort to secure a trade deal with China.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his idea that you have to be utterly obsequious with your negotiating partner to suggest you\u2019re a good guy and they should deal with you,\u201d said Christopher Hill, who served as the lead negotiator in the George W. Bush administration during the Six Party Talks with North Korea. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s got very little to show for it. The North Koreans have just pocketed it.\u201d\n\nAlthough Trump has emphasized that Kim has abided by a private pledge in Singapore to refrain from testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, experts say the North has improved the accuracy and maneuverability of its short-range arsenal.\n\nAnd although the president has maintained tough economic sanctions, the Pentagon has significantly scaled down its drills with the South Koreans under Trump\u2019s directives, which defense analysts warned could degrade the allies\u2019 ability to respond to an attack.\n\nAlthough the Hanoi summit imploded in dramatic failure, with the two leaders breaking off talks before a scheduled lunch, Trump demonstrated almost immediately afterward the lengths to which he was willing to go to placate Kim in service of maintaining their relationship.\n\nAt a news conference before leaving the city, Trump was asked whether he had confronted Kim about the death of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died days after being released from 17 months in captivity in North Korea. Trump responded by saying Kim told him \u201che didn\u2019t know about\u201d Warmbier\u2019s mistreatment.\n\n\u201cI will take him at his word,\u201d he said, adding that Kim \u201cfelt very badly about it.\u201d\n\nThe response outraged the Warmbier family. In May, Cindy Warmbier, Otto Warmbier\u2019s mother, called Trump\u2019s efforts to negotiate with Kim a \u201ccharade\u201d during remarks at a Washington think tank.\n\n\u201cHow can you have diplomacy with someone who never tells the truth?\u201d she said then, comparing Kim to Adolf Hitler. Cindy Warmbier declined to comment for this article when reached by phone.\n\nJean H. Lee, a Korea expert at the Wilson Center, noted that in addition to siding with Kim, Trump has adopted some of the North Korean leader\u2019s subversive language. She pointed to Trump\u2019s reference to U.S.-South Korea drills as \u201cwar games,\u201d a term Lee described as pure North Korean propaganda.\n\n\u201cIt betrays his lack of understanding on these issues and how easily swayed he is \u2014 it\u2019s like North Korea 101,\u201d said Lee, who served as the Associated Press bureau chief in Pyongyang from 2008 to 2013. \u201cHe is placing a priority on his personal relationship over what\u2019s best for the United States and the region.\u201d\n\nLee added that the Kim family has long used a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy, one that has appeared to pay off with Bolton. Pyongyang detested the neocon former Bush aide who had long been opposed to talks and, two months before joining Trump\u2019s White House, made the case in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that a U.S. military first strike on North Korea was legally defensible.\n\nAlthough Bolton was at the table in Hanoi \u2014 where Trump reportedly held a hard line in demanding that Pyongyang relinquish all its nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief \u2014 the national security adviser was conspicuously absent when Trump shook hands with Kim at the Korean demilitarized zone in late June. Bolton was instead on a visit to Mongolia, while Trump was joined by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and lead negotiator Stephen Biegun, as well as his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s convenient that he throws Bolton under the bus completely for the failure,\u201d said Sue Mi Terry, a Korea analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies who served as a CIA analyst during the Bush administration.\n\nTerry said that Kim has employed a reciprocal strategy of refraining from direct criticism of Trump because he knows \u201cyou need to praise him to make Trump happy.\u201d By contrast, she added, Trump\u2019s flattery of Kim won\u2019t make a difference if the United States won\u2019t offer tangible sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cTrump thinks everybody is that gullible and stupid\u201d to fall for the flattery, Terry said, \u201cbecause he is the one who craves it.\u201d", "description": "In a string of extraordinary episodes, the president has aligned himself with one of the world\u2019s most brutal dictators against individual Americans, the intelligence community, the military and U.S. allies.", "authors": ["David Nakamura", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZkX7CDmVyhKDDRShgV4IYGiRMQ0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2T6MNPWQFEI6TDA4PSHOPBNYKU.jpg"}
