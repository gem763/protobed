The problem is, you like it so much you\u2019re really just not very ambitious. And you worry that in the age of Workism, you\u2019ll regret not trying harder to \u201cget ahead.\u201d Is being satisfied a problem?\n\nDear Human Resource,\n\nI\u2019m a lawyer at good-sized firm, and I love my job. I am rewarded, challenged, engaged and interested. I like Mondays. I\u2019m that person. However, I need help with career trajectory and the pressure to be ambitious. Specifically, I don\u2019t feel a ton of ambition. I don\u2019t feel the need to compete with my peers for exciting assignments, to rub elbows with senior partners so they\u2019ll ask me to work with them, or to actively pursue development opportunities. I like the work that I do and the lifestyle and balance that I feel in my current role. (By way of background, I\u2019m in my mid 30s, married with two young kids.) I\u2019m worried that I\u2019m stunting my career prospects by not pushing harder. If I don\u2019t pursue challenging opportunities now, maybe in 10 years I\u2019ll wish I was doing the \u201ccooler\u201d work but discover I\u2019m lacking the skills I didn\u2019t bother to build when I was young. On the other hand, why should I race and compete and push when my current role is satisfying, and could possibly be satisfying forever? I really can see myself being very happy with what I do, long term. Any wisdom or guidance you can provide will be graciously accepted. Thank you so much!\n\nAmbition is certainly crucial to achieving a standout career. But maybe the issue isn\u2019t that you lack ambition \u2014 it\u2019s that having a standout career just isn\u2019t your top priority. Maybe other things are simply more important to you. And that\u2019s ok.\n\nIt can be easy to forget that this is ok, because we live in a culture, and a media environment, heavily geared toward the assumption that everybody is absolutely consumed with getting ahead at work, all the time: Find your calling, pursue your passion, lean in, crush it.\n\nIn a recent essay in The Atlantic, writer Derek Thompson pointed out that the whole notion of clawing your way up to Senior VP, or whatever, as some kind of gauge of personal value, is an early 20th century invention.\n\nAnd that\u2019s gradually led to the emergence of what Thompson calls Workism, a near-religious take on the importance of one\u2019s job: \u201cthe belief that work is not only necessary to economic production, but also the centrepiece of one\u2019s identity and life\u2019s purpose; and the belief that any policy to promote human welfare must always encourage more work.\u201d\n\nYou can reject Workism and live to tell the tale! On some level, in fact, everybody should probably think about being at least an occasional Workism heretic.\n\nStay on your game\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not telling you to blow off your job. To the contrary, be vigilant about doing what\u2019s expected of you, and seeking clear feedback from your managers.\n\nThe difference is you\u2019re not obsessing about executing some grand long-term plan for total career domination. You don\u2019t have to marinate in books and podcasts that float tactics and strategies for maximum productivity. You can just, you know, do your job.\n\nIn some work scenarios, your managers might expect you display a lot of ambition. But it\u2019s more likely that what they really want to be sure of is your engagement. A manager might, for instance, really value you taking up some thankless task that your more ambitious colleagues avoided \u2014 not because it\u2019s your stealth get-ahead move, but because you\u2019re paying attention and you take the organisation and its goals seriously.\n\nThere\u2019s no upside in flat-out announcing, \u201cI\u2019m just not that ambitious.\u201d But in communicating with managers, in review sessions or just day-to-day conversation, think about how to get this message across: You\u2019re satisfied with your work, you care about getting it done correctly, and you\u2019re open to learning new things. But you believe you\u2019re ultimately happy and effective as a role player rather than as someone trying to battle their way to the top.\n\nBetray workism\n\nOnce you\u2019ve thought through how to make sure you\u2019re not accidentally broadcasting total indifference to the gig, you can safely focus on Workism apostasy.\n\nThe pressure you feel to display ambition probably isn\u2019t coming from your boss. It\u2019s coming from the culture in general, and all the gurus suggesting that if you\u2019re not striving to reach the very top of your field, then you\u2019re some kind of loser. So you better start building those uber-productive habits that, according to these gurus, will somehow let everybody rise to the top. We can all be Number One if we try!\n\nIn reality, this obviously impossible variation on the Lake Wobegone effect is exactly what makes so many people miserable. It\u2019s one reason that burnout is such a popular topic lately. And it\u2019s one reason that unhappiness with work is so prevalent among the so-called \u201ceducated elite,\u201d who have been so thoroughly primed to be the best.\n\nThere\u2019s an argument that this pressure is even more acute for Millenials like you, and is being further amplified by workplace technology; thanks to tools like Slack we not only work hard, we perform working hard.\n\nBut we can\u2019t all work harder than everyone else; we can\u2019t all be the best. And truth is, not even being an elite, NBA-level star in whatever your profession may be, guarantees happiness. (Plenty of literal NBA stars end up unhappy.)\n\nWriter Matt Haig, sketching an argument for not taking work too seriously, quotes Bertrand Russell: \u201cOne of the symptoms of an approaching nervous breakdown is the belief that one\u2019s work is terribly important.\u201d\n\nSo sometimes we\u2019re better off accepting that if we can\u2019t be great, it\u2019s totally fine to be good. We should all do the best work we can, and play the role we\u2019re meant to play. It\u2019s ok to be ok with being ok. Remember that there are other things to be \u201cpassionate\u201d about. I can think of some. I hope you can, too.", "description": "You are one of the lucky ones: You  like your job! The problem is, you like it so much you\u2019re really just not very ambitious.
