(AP) \u2014 Tom Flacco threw a school-record six touchdown passes in the first half, five to Shane Leatherbury, as Towson steamrolled Bucknell, 56-7 in a nonconference game on Saturday.\n\nThe brother of Denver Broncos quarterback Joe, Flacco hit Chris Clark with a 12-yard scoring pass four minutes into the game, then hit Leatherbury with two scoring passes less than a minute apart as the Tigers staked a 21-0 lead after one quarter.\n\nAfter Jared Cooper scored from 3-yards out for Bucknell's only points, Leatherbury pulled in passes from 2- and 45-yards out to make it 42-7 at the break.\n\nD'Ago Hunter took the opening kick of the second half and returned it 92 yards for a touchdown and Aaron Speight scored from a yard out to complete the scoring.\n\nTowson checked Bucknell on 18 yards of offense in the first quarter and the Bison trailed 28-0 before their offense ventured past midfield.\n\nFlacco was 16 of 22 for 203 yards. Leatherbury's five touchdown catches ties a single-game school record set by Andrae Brown in 2005.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
