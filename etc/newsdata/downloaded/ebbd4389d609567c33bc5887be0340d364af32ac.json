Steve Young hung \u2018em up 20 years ago, departing with a career passing rating (96.8) that ranks No. 7 all-time.\n\nIn between and since then, several quarterbacks known for running as much as passing have terrorized NFL defenses. Scramblers of significance include Michael Vick, Roger Staubach and Russell Wilson.\n\nHowever, despite the list of luminaries who have led potent attacks, \u201cdual-threat quarterback\u201d remains something of an asterisk. It isn\u2019t a full-fledged stigma, yet it carries a sense of \u201cotherness\u201d \u2026 as in other than a \u201cregular\u201d QB.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s Lamar Jackson isn\u2019t your typical quarterback. For that matter, neither is Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, though he distinguishes himself through normal measures (i.e., passing ability), not the former\u2019s preternatural skills as a rusher.\n\nBoth have been absurdly good in their first two games this season and they\u2019ll face each other Sunday in Week 3.\n\nMahomes is merely continuing the exploits that made him the 2018 NFL MVP. Jackson is trying to convince the league that he\u2019s not just a halfback taking snaps.\n\nPutting himself in the same sentence with Mahomes makes a great opening argument.\n\nAccording to NFL Research, the pair are the only QBs in the Super Bowl era with a 70 percent completion rate, seven touchdown passes, and zero interceptions over the first two games of a season. In a shock to stereotypes and pigeonholes everywhere, Jackson\u2019s passer rating (145.2) and completion percentage (71.9) are slightly higher than Mahomes\u2018 (136.3 and 71.4).\n\nLike virtually everyone else reading this column, I would prefer Mahomes as my QB. But Jackson\u2019s emergence makes me revisit the league\u2019s historical fondness for statuesque passers opposed to mobile options.\n\nIn a segment on ESPN, the Hall-of-Famer Young expressed surprise and disappointment that runner-passers continue to be exceptions in the NFL. He thought they would become the norm after he retired with two MVP awards and a pair of Super Bowl rings.\n\nBut NFL executives still seem to prefer QBs like Tom Brady, whose main threat as a runner is causing convulsive laughter among would-be tacklers. A quarterback who spends his life in the pocket makes games less stressful for his general manager, who doesn\u2019t have to worry about scampers ending in big hits.\n\nBesides, the way officials call roughing penalties nowadays, standing in the pocket is almost safer than standing on the sideline.\n\nJackson might as well have been a single-wing halfback the way Baltimore used him as a rookie, after he supplanted Joe Flacco on the depth chart last season.\n\nJackson had 26 rushing attempts in his first start and averaged 17 as the starter before registering just nine carries in a playoff loss against the Chargers. He completed more than 60 percent of his passes just once and didn\u2019t offer evidence that much improvement was possible.\n\nHe looked like a rich man\u2019s Tim Tebow.\n\nBut this season, he looks like the next, great dual-threat legend. In last week\u2019s 23-17 win against Arizona, Jackson produced the most rushing yards (120) ever for a player who threw for more than 250 yards in the same game. His feats included a perfectly placed ball that hit tightly covered Hollywood Brown in stride, good for a 41-yard gain on third-and-11 that allowed Baltimore to run out the clock.\n\n\u201cTo make that throw,\u201d Ravens coach John Harbaugh marveled to reporters afterward, \u201cyou can talk about any quarterback you want in the history of the game. There\u2019s no quarterback making any better throw than that. Ever.\u201d\n\nMahomes appears destined to be mentioned in conversations about the best passes and passers ever. It\u2019s far-fetched to think Jackson will qualify. But he\u2019s made remarkable strides since leaving Louisville and listening to several NFL talent evaluators say he\u2019ll never succeed at quarterback.\n\nHis attitude and work ethic are such that his running might be on the verge of sharing top billing with his passing. Once unthinkable, that transformation is happening sooner than later.\n\n\u201cY\u2019all watched Lamar make great throws all day from the pocket,\u201d Cardinals coach Kliff Kingsbury told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s improved dramatically there. You\u2019ve got to tip your hat to him. He\u2019s staying in there and throwing it. He can beat you that way and beat you with his legs. He\u2019s going to be hard to handle for anybody.\u201d\n\nAll these years after Tarkenton and Young, and despite the success of Wilson and Cam Newton, the NFL still struggles to accept a simple fact: Two threats are better than one.\n\nWhen the one is as exceptional as Mahomes, there are no complaints.\n\nBut, ultimately, weapons like Jackson make NFL life twice as nice.\n\n\u2981 Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
