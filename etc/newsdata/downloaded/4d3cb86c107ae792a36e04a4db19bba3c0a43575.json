Two years later, her heartbroken mom has written a moving essay about her daughter, Alexa \u201cLexi\u201d Lamoureux, saying she \u201cwas not a \u2018junkie,\u2019\u201d and grew up in a loving home with a great support system.\n\n\u201cWe are not addicts,\u201d Susan Lamoureux wrote in The Sun. \u201cWe are loving parents who have always given the best to our children. Lexi was not a \u2018junkie,\u2019 as some would say. She worked from the age of 16 and supported herself until her death. She was somebody. She was our beloved daughter. Her father and I will forever wonder if there was anything we could have done differently. It takes one use to become addicted to heroin.\u201d\n\nMISSOURI MOM'S BEFORE, AFTER PHOTOS OF ADDICTED SON GO VIRAL: 'THE FACE OF HEROIN AND METH'\n\nLamoureux wrote that her daughter first tried heroin as a 19-year-old undergraduate student in Massachusetts, and swore that she would never try it again.\n\n\u201cShe told me and promised me she wouldn\u2019t do it again and I believed her,\u201d Lamoureux wrote. \u201cBut from that first time, the vicious cycle of addiction took hold and Lexi would never be the same again.\u201d\n\nLamoureux said her daughter went to rehab several times, attended classes and alternative therapies, but the addiction kept creeping back in. The grieving mother said the family\u2019s world came crashing down on Sept. 16, 2017, when her husband, Chris, found their daughter unconscious on her bedroom floor.\n\nTENNESSEE COUPLE'S METH ADDICTION, RECOVERY PHOTOS GO VIRAL: 'IT GETS BETTER'\n\nThe then-28-year-old was rushed to a local hospital and then transferred to a larger facility in Maine, but doctors said she had been brain dead for an estimated 45 minutes. The family decided to donate her organs, and while waiting for potential recipients, they surrounded Lexi with love in her final days.\n\nLamoureux said she has dedicated her life to honoring her daughter\u2019s memory and working to reduce the stigma of heroin addiction. The family started the \"Learn from Lexi Foundation,\" and plan to continue raising awareness.\n\n\u201cI am here to explain this: If my daughter, who had the world at her feet and the love and support of her family, could become addicted from that first heroin use and subsequently die from an overdose, then it can happen to your child or loved one just as quickly and easily,\u201d she wrote.\n\nLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnother mother recently went viral for sharing chilling before-and-after photos of her son, who she says is addicted to heroin and methamphetamine in an effort to raise awareness.
