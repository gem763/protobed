That saw purchases drop a combined 50 billion yen ($463 million) from its previous operation. That\u2019s the first time the central bank has cut purchases in all three segments at a single operation since it started the yield-curve control in 2016.\n\nFriday\u2019s move signals that the BOJ is stepping up its fight against lower yields after a global debt rally sent Japan\u2019s benchmark 10-year rate to the brink of a record low of minus 0.3% earlier this month. The central bank wouldn\u2019t allow yields to fall for a prolonged period, and it was desirable for the yield curve to steepen a bit, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said at a news conference Thursday.\n\n\u201cReducing purchases right after Kuroda\u2019s comments on the 10-year and super-long yields Thursday leaves a stronger impression that the BOJ is ready to act even if markets aren\u2019t expecting it,\u201d said Takenobu Nakashima, a senior rates strategist at Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. \u201cThis will leave some breathing room for the BOJ.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s 10-year yield rose in response to the BOJ\u2019s action and was up two basis points for the day at minus 0.205% as of 10:50 a.m. in Tokyo. It slid to a three-year low of minus 0.295% on Sept. 4. The yen was 0.1% higher at 107.95 per dollar.", "description": "BOJ Makes Sweeping Cuts to Bond Buying in a Bid to Steepen Curve", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picaebecdf8b132273c620aa287ce22c37f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
