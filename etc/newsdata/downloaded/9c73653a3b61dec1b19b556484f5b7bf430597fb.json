If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nA deadline of 30 September would be highly problematic for the prime minister as it falls on the eve of the Conservative party conference, and it remains to be seen whether the EU will stick to the threat.\n\nJohnson would be wary of showing his hand at such a sensitive point given the potentially negative reaction by his party to any movement towards the EU\u2019s demands on the backstop.\n\nRinne said that he intended to speak to the European council president, Donald Tusk, and Johnson to discuss the need for swift action from the UK.\n\nEU leaders want a clear run for negotiations before a summit on 17 October so that they need not engage in detailed talks on the issue and can nod through any deal.\n\nJohnson spoke to the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, by phone on Wednesday afternoon. A Downing Street spokesperson said they discussed their continued determination to reach a deal.\n\nThey also discussed their lunch meeting in Luxembourg on Monday, which was described as \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d during the call.\n\nIt emerged earlier in the day that during the lunch meeting Johnson had expressed surprise to his advisers when he was informed about the scale of checks that would still be needed on the island of Ireland under a plan the government has mooted for the Irish border.\n\nThe two-hour lunch preceded Johnson\u2019s humiliation at the hands of Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, when he failed to attend a press conference due to anti-Brexit protests.\n\nEU officials said the advantage for them had been in being able to spell out the problems directly to the prime minister. \u201cIt seems to have helped the penny drop,\u201d said one diplomatic source.\n\nWill Corbyn\u2019s Brexit referendum strategy work? Our panel responds | Polly Toynbee and others Read more\n\nDuring talks with Juncker and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, the prime minister was shown in detail how allowing Northern Ireland to stick to common EU rules on food and livestock, known as sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), would still fail to avoid checks on the vast majority of goods that cross the Irish border.\n\nDowning Street has described as \u201cnonsense\u201d a report in the Financial Times that Johnson turned to his chief negotiator, David Frost, and the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and said: \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me the SPS plan doesn\u2019t solve the customs problem?\u201d\n\nBut senior EU sources confirmed that Johnson had expressed surprise during the lunch at the complexity of the situation, and that it appeared to have been a \u201cbit of a reality check to hear it from EU officials\u201d.\n\nSources said it was not the case that Johnson had failed to understand the role of the shared customs territory in the Irish backstop but that it was the scale of checks that would still be necessary without such an arrangement that appeared to hit home.\n\nA second EU diplomat confirmed: \u201cWhen the commission explained the technical challenges and enduring need for customs checks under the UK proposals, Johnson expressed surprise in the direction of his advisers.\u201d\n\nIn his address to the European parliament on Wednesday, Juncker hinted at the problems that remained. \u201cI have no emotional attachment to the backstop,\u201d he said of his talks with Johnson. \u201cBut I made clear that I do have an intimate commitment to its objectives.\u201d\n\nGiven the wide gap between the two sides, Juncker also expressed doubts about the possibility that a mutually agreeable replacement for the Irish backstop would be agreed before 31 October when Johnson has said the UK will leave, \u201cdo or die\u201d.\n\nQ&A What is a Northern Ireland-only backstop? Show Hide The British government\u2019s version of Brexit involves the UK ultimately leaving the single market and customs union, requiring the return of a range of checks on goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The \u201cbackstop\u201d is intended as a standstill placeholder to ensure such checks do not have to be imposed between Brexit happening with a deal, and the start of a new free trade agreement yet to be negotiated between the UK and the EU. Theresa May's withdrawal agreement proposed keeping the whole of the UK in a shared customs territory with the EU during this period. An alternative idea involves only Northern Ireland staying in the EU\u2019s customs territory. That would place a customs border in the Irish Sea. May described it as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, but the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has opened the current talks by proposing an all-Ireland agri-food zone. The suggestion is that he will seek to quietly build on that with further NI-only arrangements. Given an NI-only backstop was an EU proposal in the first place, the U-turn would be warmly welcomed in Brussels, although attempts to give the Northern Ireland assembly a veto on its continuation would not be acceptable, and the DUP would be unlikely to support the prime minister in such a move in parliament. If there is a no-deal Brexit, then there is no backstop. Daniel Boffey\n\nThe UK said after the Juncker lunch that it would now move to negotiating daily with the EU rather than twice a week but a spokeswoman for the European commission told reporters on Wednesday that there had been no such request as yet.\n\nShe said: \u201cWe have said and reconfirm that we are fully available to meet 24/7 seven days a week as soon as the UK would like to meet us. But for the moment I do not have any new announcements or scheduling to pass on to you today.\u201d\n\nBarnier had suggested that there was a lack of seriousness in the UK\u2019s approach during his own statement to the European parliament.\n\n\u201cAlmost three years after the British referendum, ladies and gentlemen, it is certainly not a question of pretending to negotiate,\u201d he told MEPs.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson had his first conversation with the president of the European parliament, David Sassoli, on Wednesday. Sassoli is understood to have told the prime minister that any agreement would need to be agreed by both the Commons and the EU\u2019s parliament, and \u201crobust debate and parliamentary scrutiny is essential\u201d, in a thinly veiled criticism of the decision to prorogue Westminster.", "description": "EU ultimatum comes as sources say PM was \u2018surprised\u2019 by levels of checks on the border", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d164a62605ef42736b2c2eb52889c3b37bba647/0_0_4714_2829/master/4714.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ec7dca3a27fd9252b9b9917a7e6d0af", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
