Under the new guidance, this year\u2019s free cash flow is likely to be around -700 million euros, something that may strain the company\u2019s credit rating (although Delbos, who doubles as chief financial officer, played down suggestions of a downgrade on Thursday\u2019s hastily-arranged analyst call).\n\nThe news wiped out all of Renault\u2019s gains for year and put it firmly at the bottom of the CAC 40 (which also had bad news from Danone (PA:DANO), Remy Cointreau (PA:RCOP) and Thales (PA:TCFP) to digest). It also dragged down rivals Fiat Chrysler (MI:FCHA), Peugeot (PA:PEUP) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).\n\nThe reasons are depressingly familiar: the company is heavily dependent on Europe, where its sales have been hit not only by macroeconomic weakness, but also by the introduction of tighter emissions standards, which have forced it to invest more in cleaner engines.\n\nRenault (PA:RENA) was a late, reluctant and not particularly distinguished convert to the now largely-discredited diesel technology, in a continent where over 400,000 lives were shortened by air pollution in 2016, according to EU research published earlier this week.\n\nThe developments are another stark reminder of the existential challenges facing the European car industry in general and Renault (PA:RENA) in particular, given the way its alliance with Nissan has frayed in the last 12 months. They come only a week after chief executive Thierry Bollore was forced out, with the aim of restoring a relationship on which Renault depends for its bottom line.\n\nLike many others in the sector, Renault (PA:RENA) will be relieved if the U.K. can leave the EU without causing further harm to the European economy. However, Thursday\u2019s figures suggest that Renault is going to need much more than a smooth Brexit to turn itself around.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRenault shares plunge as profit warning deepens its problems\n\nShares slip on weak China growth, dollar suffers weekly mauling\n\nThousands converge on Barcelona for fifth day of Catalan protests", "description": "By Geoffrey Smith", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
