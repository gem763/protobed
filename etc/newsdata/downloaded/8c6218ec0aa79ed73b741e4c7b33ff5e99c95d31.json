There are also plans for another significant tranche of money underway, likely to be closed later this year.\n\nIn this latest round, a Series C that brings the total raised to \u20ac85 million, Geely is investing alongside other unnamed new and existing investors in the Bruchsal, Germany-based company. Previous backers include Intel and Daimler, the German car giant that owns Mercedes and a number of other brands.\n\nValuation is not being disclosed but Rene Griemens, Volocopter\u2019s CFO, confirmed that the stake is under half of the \u20ac50 million and gives Geely a share of about 10 percent in the company, similar to that of other big co-investors, with co-founders Alexander Zosel and Stephan Wolf continuing to hold a majority of the company. Doing the math, it would imply a valuation of between \u20ac200 million and \u20ac250 million for the startup.\n\nGriemens also said in an interview that the German company intends to use the funding to continue working on its taxi R&D; meeting safety and other regulatory requirements for its small taxi vessels (which seat two); working other upcoming models such as those that can transport cargo; and business development around commercial launches.\n\nIndeed, part of this latest investment is paving the way for future business: Geely and Volocopter will be working on a joint venture to bring the Volocopter and its \u201cUrban Air Mobility\u201d concept to China.\n\nWhile there is no commercial airtaxi or other \u201cflying car\u201d services in existence today in any urban area, the market for hopefuls is a crowded one, with the likes of Lilium, Kitty Hawk, eHang, Uber, and many others building completely new styles of aircraft and hoping to play a role in offering short-range flights as an affordable alternative to road-based transportation. (Blade, an airtaxi service of sorts, is offering more conventional helicopters and other vessels in its limited launch for executives.)\n\n\u201cUrban mobility needs to evolve in the next few years to meet rising demand,\u201d said Florian Reuter, CEO of Volocopter, in a statement. \u201cWith our Volocopter air taxis, we are adding a whole new level of mobility in the skies.\u201d\n\nAmong its many potential competitors, Volocopter has been one of the more prolific when it comes to building and testing its drone-like vehicles, most recently in Helsinki where it became the first autonomous VTOL \u2014 vertical take-off and landing \u2014 aircraft to operate in the same airspace as other commercial aircraft.\n\nYou might also recall when Intel brought the Volocopter on stage at CES in Las Vegas in 2018 for a flight demonstration during its keynote, still the only time the Volocopter has been airborne in the US. Griemens said the company was less focused on the US as a target market, in part because it didn\u2019t look like regulations for autonomous (or semi-autonomous) VTOL craft would be resolved any time soon.\n\nDetails on how Volocopter\u2019s service would operate are still \u2014 pardon the expression \u2014 up in the air, but Griemens said that while Volocopter would own the aircraft, it would likely partner with local operators to help run the service. Similarly, the initial running of these autonomous craft would almost certainly involve \u201cdrivers\u201d (the company says operating them is significantly less difficult than piloting other conventional aircraft) who are partially assisting and monitoring the autonomous operation.\n\nThe overall price of each aircraft, meanwhile, would likely be one-fifth to one-quarter of the price since the cost of operating it ultimately would be significantly lower and the initial hardware cost would be, too. While initial rides would be more expensive, after five to 10 years, the company estimates that the price would come down to the cost of a taxi ride on the ground.\n\n\u201cThe goal was always to democratize flying,\u201d he said.\n\nIts first launch markets are likely to be Singapore, Dubai \u2014 where it has a partnership with the city \u2014 and an unspecified large European city. That could be somewhere in its home market of Germany, or Helsinki, but just as equally London, where the company has been engaging with city officials on what an airtaxi service could look like. (It\u2019s also part of a new experimental \u2018sandbox\u2019 launched by the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority to test out technology related to air-based transportation and travel.)\n\nBut even with regulatory frameworks in place, delays can come in many forms. This isn\u2019t even the first time that Volocopter has predicted commercial services in \u201ctwo to three years.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, startups like Volocopter represent a credible version of the future of transportation, so for companies like Geely, Daimler and Intel, which still have large legacy businesses, investing in and working with Volocopter gives them a shot at playing a key role (and having a financial stake) in that market.\n\n\u201cGeely is transitioning from being an automotive manufacturer to a mobility technology group, investing in and developing a wide range of next-generation technologies,\u201d said Li Shufu, Geely\u2019s chairman, in a statement. \u201cOur joint venture with Volocopter underlines our confidence in Volocopter air taxis as the next ambitious step in our wider expansion in both electrification and new mobility services.\u201d\n\nGeely, as it happens, also has around a 10 percent stake in Daimler and works with the Volcopter co-investor on other partnerships. Daimler has been a prolific investor in next-generation transportation services and is building a ride-sharing service with Geely in China.\n\nUpdated with more accurate detail of the cost of a Volocopter model compared to a helicopter.", "description": "The promise of flying cars\u00a0has become an idea more synonymous with the tech world\u2019s shortcomings than its exciting potential, but today one of the startups that has been focused on actually trying to make small, airborne vehicles a reality is announcing a fundraise and says it\u2019s on track for a commercial launch in two to [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/VoloCity_takes_off_into_night.jpg?w=708", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
