Time\n\nHarley has been mindful of the challenges it faces in the marketplace as its older customers age out of riding on heavyweight motorcycles.\n\nThe company has seen a string of quarterly sales declines as the marketplace changes.\n\nHow well the LiveWire helps achieve that overall goal of bringing a new generation of riders to the brand remains to be seen.\n\n\"It depends how long it takes,\" to fix the problem, Yarbrough said. \"It probably just sets back their original goals of how many new riders they wanted to bring in.\"\n\nThe LiveWire has undergone rigorous product testing in preparation for it being introduced to consumers, Harley has said. It has a suggested retail price of $29,799.\n\nA number of companies worldwide also are seeking to bring electric motorcycles to the marketplace in an effort to attract younger, environmentally conscious riders who see the electric products as more earth-friendly than their fossil-fueled counterparts.\n\nBut the size of that market remains a question.\n\n\"You have to be a really hard core believer and into the environment totally,\" Yarbrough said. \"The number of people and the size of the pool of people who are interested in a bike like this is probably pretty small.\"\n\nHarley-Davidson has been adding smaller and medium-size bikes to its lineup to try to match up with the changing demographics.\n\n\"How long does it take until those bikes gain enough sales momentum to offset the declines in the heavyweight category? That's the million dollar question,\" Yarbrough said. \"I think that's what investors struggle with.\"\n\nFollow Joe Taschler on Twitter: @JoeTaschler.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/10/14/harley-davidson-halts-production-live-wire-electric-motorcycles/3979634002/", "description": "Harley-Davidson has halted production of its LiveWire electric motorcycles as it investigates a \"non-standard condition\" found on the products.", "authors": ["Joe Taschler", "Published P.M.
