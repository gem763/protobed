But it\u2019s illegal to use it against civilians.\n\nDespite an agreement for a \u201cpause\u201d in fighting negotiated by Vice President Mike Pence and touted Thursday by President Donald Trump, fighting was continuing in Ras al Ain, where 38 war wounded being treated in a hospital cannot be easily evacuated, noted Foreign Policy.\n\nTurkey denied accusations it used chemical weapons against civilians. \u201cIt is a fact known by everyone that there are no chemical weapons in the inventory of the Turkish armed forces,\u201d Defense Minister Hulusi Akar told reporters.\n\nIn an interesting twist, the OPCW announced it launched its investigation into a possible chemical attack a day after it revealed a $39,000 donation from Turkey to the organization.\n\nThe U.S. concluded just last month that that Syria used chlorine gas in an attack in May against rebels, including the Kurds, in Syria.\n\nThe Trump administration launched a missile attack against Syria in 2017 after Bashar Assad\u2019s regime was suspected of using sarin nerve gas in an attack that killed 80 people. A year later in 2018, at least 40 people died in a chemical attack that may have involved sarin or chlorine.", "description": "At least six Kurds, including children, reportedly suffered severe burns.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa5e1f210000e017ad3449.jpeg?cache=iwc42l9p3b&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
