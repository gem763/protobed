He quickly lost about 60 percent of his skin and was put into an induced coma to spare him further suffering. Doctors in Germany tried skin grafts from donors, but they all failed.\n\n\u201cHe was in severe pain and asking a lot of questions I could not answer: \u2018Why do I suffer from this disease? Why do I have to live this life? All children can run around and play, why am I not allowed to play soccer?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t answer these questions,\u201d says the boy\u2019s father, who asked not to be named.\n\nLab-grown skin\n\nDesperate, the family contacted Dr Michele De Luca at the Centre for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Modena in Italy.\n\nDe Luca\u2019s team took a small piece of unblistered skin from the boy\u2019s body, genetically modified its cells to correct the defect, and used them to grow sheets of healthy skin to cover the rest of his body.\n\nIn their lab, the scientists grew almost one square metre of skin. It was transplanted onto the boy in three operations.\n\nTwo years later, the child is still being closely monitored but his new skin is holding on well and not forming blisters.\n\nDetails of the study were published on Wednesday (Nov. 8) in the journal Nature.\n\n\u201cAlready after the first transplant on the four limbs in October, so you can imagine for the second transplant, the bigger one on his back, the regeneration of the skin did something to the boy, he got better right away, his vital parameters were getting better and that\u2019s when we realised that we had done it,\u201d says De Luca.\n\nHis father said: \u201cIt felt like a dream, it is very hard for me to put this in words, I wish that all children with the same disease could be treated this way. It worked incredibly.\u201d\n\nWith AP", "description": "In a lab in Italy, scientists have grown replacement skin for a young boy who had lost most of his to a rare and devastating genetic disease.", "authors": ["Natalie Huet"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/402417/1000x563_402417.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-09"}
