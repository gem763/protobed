Tracey\u2019s track, with its pitched-up sample from soul singer Jorja Smith, cut through all the season\u2019s Latin-flavoured pop, functional house and endless Ed Sheeran singles and still sits, unbudged, in the charts, a feelgood summer hit that refuses to accept that autumn is here.\n\nTracey, whose real name is Ch\u00e9 (after Guevara) Wolton Grant, though he usually goes by his stage name, has been having a breakthrough year. In February, he self-released his debut album, which has since become the second-biggest album of 2019 by an independent musician; to cap it off, he\u2019s playing two sold-out nights at the 10,000-capacity venue Alexandra Palace next month.\n\nUnlike many of his peers, who are at the beck and call of a major label, Tracey is used to calling the shots. \u201cI can do whatever the hell I want,\u201d he tells me. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, doing shows that big, but he doesn\u2019t get nervous, he says \u2013 or at least you can\u2019t tell. \u201cI\u2019m the least animated person I know,\u201d he quips during our photoshoot. \u201cEven on stage\u201d, he says: \u201cI just walk across it.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t entirely true. Tracey is celebrated for the rapid-fire displays of his vocals and his versatility, flipping between the various styles that are defining UK music right now: grime, trap, drill, anything lightly syncopated \u2013 no genre has gone unturned. Until 2019, however, the 25-year-old watched as his peers raced ahead. He\u2019d been grafting for years on the underground, working largely within grime music, releasing a string of well-received EPs, featuring on songs by American rappers such as A$AP Rocky and collaborating with his mate Dave, on the 2016 track Thiago Silva.\n\nMeanwhile Stormzy, who started releasing music after Tracey did, has become a national treasure, with the kind of cultural weight that led Time magazine to put him on its October cover . Dave won this year\u2019s Mercury music prize for his debut album Psychodrama, and stars in the new series of Top Boy, alongside rising London rapper Little Simz and grime veteran Kano.\n\nBecause of illness, Tracey also missed out at this year's Glastonbury. During Stormzy\u2019s Saturday headline gig, Tracey\u2019s was the first name to be mentioned in the rapper\u2019s celebratory roll-call of British MCs. But the next day, when Dave performed Thiago Silva, he plucked bucket-hatted teenager Alex Mann from the crowd to rap Tracey\u2019s part, which promptly went viral. The Mann video drew some criticism for pushing the focus on to a young white guy instead of a black artist, but it also underlined how grime had gone from gritty underground subculture to the unequivocal sound of the suburbs. And it cemented Thiago Silva as one of the most memorable duets of the decade. \u201cYou know what, I\u2019ll say it, yeah, I think it\u2019s the greatest grime song ever,\u201d says Tracey.\n\nOn the one hand, Tracey fires off boasts like a bazooka. His album cover, which pictured him dejectedly cradling a goat, may have seemed like an oddball choice, except \u201cGOAT\u201d is an internet acronym for Greatest of All Time. I\u2019ve read about journalists having to interview him at home while he plays video games, but he says now that he has trouble concentrating - he's fun to be around and a little mischievous (he says one minute that he doesn\u2019t judge anyone and then calls an anonymous rapper \u201ctrash\u201d). He is tall and smells expensive (it\u2019s Dior Eau Sauvage), dressed in designer tracksuit bottoms, his afro tucked scruffily under a baseball cap, a style he calls a \u201clittle weird\u201d.\n\nIf Stormzy ran for prime minister, he\u2019d stand a chance of winning, I swear to God\n\nBehind the bravado, though, Tracey hints at having struggled to find his moment. \u201cPeople would never have expected Ladbroke Grove to be in the top five for 10 weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, power numbers! I feel like the type of music I\u2019m making and who I am, people expect me to do well, but not be in the main spotlight. And now that I am, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh! What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going on is that since grime \u2013 the urgent, inner-city rap/electronic hybrid that evolved out of UK garage in the early 00s \u2013 bounced back in 2014, the landscape of British pop has shifted dramatically.\n\nLook over the top 40 songs of the summer and it encompasses a variety of MC-led sounds that grime paved the way for but which, except perhaps for some similar slang, are wildly different. There\u2019s the seductive syncopation of UK Afrobeats, which amalgamates dancehall, African pop melodies and R&B, or the adjacent sound, Afro-swing, spearheaded by Mercury-nominated rapper J-Hus. The harder-edged road rap, meanwhile, emerged when grime fell out of favour, and a more recent development is drill, a nihilistic offshoot of trap that began in Chicago and transferred to London estates.\n\nStormzy told Time magazine that the reason he did the Glasto roll-call was because of a \u201chistorical thing of letting [only] one black person in at a time\u201d to the mainstream \u2013 now there are countless MCs commanding attention. Grime, for example, was called \u201cone of our most successful musical exports\u201d in a 2019 report from a UK parliamentary committee, which would have been unheard of in the days of its early stars, Wiley and Dizzee Rascal. Also unheard of would have been Tracey\u2019s forthcoming Ally Pally appearance or Kano\u2019s recent, triumphant homecoming at the Royal Albert Hall.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen MC-led music and culture have such a lasting impact on mainstream music,\u201d says Safiya Lambie-Knight, who works in artist and label marketing, Urban UK at Spotify. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a time like it before.\u201d She says that as \u201cmore doors have been opened\u201d via the success of artists such as Stormzy and Skepta, who both released their albums independently, it\u2019s allowed other artists to \u201ccarve their own names in this world, without necessarily having to be a grime artist\u201d.\n\nTracey is different in that he has scooped up these many-tentacled styles in his musically omnivorous net. His album spans soca, drill, UK rap, various cap-tips to American trap and sad-rap and even a strum-tastic song called Country Star. (Tracey says he had originally tried to get Billy Ray Cyrus to appear on it, which maybe gave the US crooner the idea to join Lil Nas X\u2019s super-smash Old Town Road.) With Ladbroke Grove, too, Tracey was keen to do something with undeniable crossover appeal. Bigging up one\u2019s \u201cends\u201d has always been a cornerstone of grime\u2019s lyrical content, but here was AJ putting it on a clubby beat with a video shot with some camels in Marrakech. \u201cI wanted to make it for the mums, the nans, the dads, their kids. I wanted it to be a song for everyone.\u201d\n\nFor some, this move away from his roots was confusing, especially as he told Esquire earlier this year: \u201cJust don\u2019t call me a grime rapper.\" But even his earlier tracks such as Spirit Bomb and Buster Cannon, he says, used trap beats. \u201cI never felt like I was in the grime scene,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cI was the outsider. So when I veered away from it, I didn\u2019t feel like I was leaving the circle \u2013 I felt like I was never in it.\u201d He says that many of the grime originators who were around during the genre\u2019s inception weren\u2019t interested in giving him a leg up. \u201cNo one paid me any attention,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to do everything on my own.\u201d\n\nStormzy, however, has been a key mentor: \u201cHe\u2019s given me so much good advice. He comes and collects me, we drive around, and he says, \u2018Listen, the more popular you get, the more people gonna hate on you for reasons that are non-existent.\u2019 He told me, \u2018Bro, ignore them, they don\u2019t mean anything.\u2019 When you\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018Why did these guys hate me? Why did they think my new song\u2019s shit?\u2019, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTracey puts his eclecticism down to his Welsh single mother, whom he holds in the highest regard. A former pirate radio DJ, she used to play him dancehall, rap, garage, jungle and house, he says, in their home on the Sutton estate in North Kensington. He honed his speedy rapping skills over his mother\u2019s drum\u2019n\u2019bass records, which are far faster than your average rap or grime tune. \u201cIt\u2019s like when footballers run underwater in water tanks,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\u2019s a high pressure against your body. If you can run fast in a water tank, when they take you out of the water, you can run way faster because there\u2019s less pressure. I used to go on to radio sets and be spraying so fast, people would be like, \u2018How are you doing that?\u2019\u201d\n\nHis Trinidadian father, meanwhile, who moved out when Tracey was six, had been in a UK hip-hop group in the 90s, which Tracey has always refused to identify. He taught his son how to write lyrics but also about \u201cthe dilemmas of being black, which my mum can\u2019t teach me,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cSome things you never really fully understand unless you are actually black and you experience how it feels when someone treats you differently based on your skin colour.\u201d But he encountered prejudice of another kind too. The estate he lived on was largely white and as a mixed-race kid, he says, \u201cI feel like I was more accepted by the white community than the black [one]. A lot of the time, the black kids would be like, \u2018Oh, \u2019cause you lighter, you\u2019re not as \u201cgang\u201d as us. That\u2019s really the attitude they have. It made me misbehave more because I felt like I had to prove a point.\u201d\n\nHe sold drugs for a while, nothing heavy. \u201cEveryone did that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s bog-standard. White kids from good homes sell drugs. I just did what I had to do because we didn\u2019t have enough money. I stopped as soon as I had enough to survive.\u201d His mum \u201cdidn\u2019t even know\u201d about his extracurricular exploits \u201cuntil she heard my lyrics\u201d. He was a smart kid, and briefly studied criminology at London Metropolitan University before dropping out to focus on music.\n\nWhen he first started rapping, Tracey says many of his lyrics reflected his frustration at his social situation. \u201cI was very angry: angry at society, angry at life, angry at everything,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing a black youth in London is very hard and it\u2019s not fair. Why is it that I have to pay this much for school uniform when my mum can\u2019t afford it? Why is it that the government doesn\u2019t help? Why is my rent so high? That\u2019s how I was feeling, so all my music sounded very aggressive, violent, angry, all these negative things.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest AJ Tracey on stage at Leeds festival, August 2019. Photograph: Katja Ogrin/Redferns\n\n\u201cThe government should be putting things in place to help young people of colour,\" he says, \u201clike youth clubs.\u201d He is passionate on this subject; his mother, a youth worker, ran the club on his estate but spaces like those are in steep decline. Between 2012 and 2016, 600 youth clubs shut down across the country, and a parliamentary committee in May this year found that more than 100 councils had slashed their budget for youth services by 91%. Such budget cuts, they said, could be linked to the rise in knife crime, which is up 93% in five years.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a connection,\u201d says Tracey. He explains that his mum was \u201calways cool with my friends chilling in my house \u2013 she knows it\u2019s much better for us to be in the house smoking weed [because] it\u2019s safe rather than being on the street, [with] police stopping us, harassing us [or] maybe we get into some sort of gang altercation\u201d. But he says that \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t have that\u201d and so youth clubs provide a \u201csafe haven for kids to hang out in\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo solve the knife problem,\u201d he continues, \u201cyou need to uplift the youth \u2013 guide them and help them. Give them a purpose. Taking away the youth clubs and places for them to hang out means, obviously, they\u2019re going to be on [the] road now [where] there\u2019s friction, there\u2019s problems, there\u2019s postcode gangs, there\u2019s drugs.\u201d Shutting down those safe havens, he continues, is \u201cobviously encouraging this beef\u201d and \u201cmaking it worse \u2013 but the government is never going to listen to that\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not my job to tell people how to conduct their lives \u2013 it\u2019s not that straightforward\n\nWhile Tracey often addresses such complex subjects in conversation he has mostly swerved them in song, unlike many of his contemporaries. Dave\u2019s song Question Time, which confronted the Tories about their litany of incompetence, won an Ivor Novello award in 2018, while Tracey\u2019s cousin, the rapper Big Zuu, released a Grenfell tribute.\n\nThe Grenfell tragedy in particular hit Tracey hard. \u201cMy friend and his whole family died in that fire,\u201d he says, \u201cso that\u2019s very close to my heart. We can see Grenfell from my mum\u2019s front room window.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t feel the need to refer to it in his music. \u201cWhatever I need to do to help in that situation I will do, but I don\u2019t need to promote it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a PR stunt. That\u2019s not a shot at anyone, but I deal with it in my own way.\u201d\n\nInstead, Tracey\u2019s music majors in braggadocio and smutty bombast, with zingers such as \u201cI\u2019m young, rich and hung\u201d (Wifey Riddim 3) and tales about, well, chasing tail. \u201cI\u2019m proud of myself, man,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople used to always tell me to stop gloating but I have the right to gloat, I deserve to talk about my achievements. They could call me boastful. I am boastful.\u201d Any songs detailing his sexual encounters with women, he continues, are just him speaking his \u201ctruth\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf a woman [has] shared her body with me, why can I not speak of my experience?\u201d he says, a little defensively. \u201cIt\u2019s not me casting a judgment on someone, it\u2019s something that has happened. You can rap about whatever the hell you wanna rap about \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019re rappers. You can have an opinion against it but you can\u2019t tell me not to do it. At the end of the day, that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nGenres such as drill are increasingly popular but they are still demonised in the media and Tracey says that he wanted to present an image of young black youth that was more carefree and fun. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be that source of release,\u201d he says. \u201cMy music, it\u2019s escapism.\u201d He says he used to be very angry (\"at life, at society, at... just everything\") but doesn\u2019t feel that any more, not least because he\u2019s upgraded to a nice apartment in Chelsea \u201cwith glass all around it \u2013 there\u2019s flowers in my house, I read cook books. I\u2019ve got a painting of Fidel Castro on my wall and I play Fortnite every day. So I\u2019m not going to be rapping about that [his old life] \u2019cause it\u2019s not what I live.\u201d\n\nHe is, however, pragmatic about being a role model. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job to be telling people how to conduct their lives: \u2018Youth, you should put your knives down\u2019; \u2018Youth, you should do this, do that\u2019\u2019\u2026 I understand the complexities of all the struggles the youth go through and I don\u2019t have the right to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t roll with a weapon\u2019, because [then] they might not roll with a weapon, and they might meet someone who doesn\u2019t like them, and they might lose their life because they didn\u2019t have a weapon on them. It\u2019s not as straightforward as people think it is.\u201d Instead, he\u2019d rather lead by example. \u201cI have loads of kids who copy what I do. So if I do stupid things and they go and do it, I\u2019m letting them down.\u201d\n\nThe next album he makes will be more \u201cconscious\u201d, he continues, although he adds that he doesn\u2019t actually enjoy talking about politics, as \u201ceverything that\u2019s said can be twisted\u201d. In June 2017, when the last general election was reaching peak mayhem, there was a grime pile-on of support for Jeremy Corbyn on Twitter (#grime4corbyn). It helped to create a \u201cyouthquake\u201d, encouraging the largest number of young voters in the country since 1992. Tracey went one step further and appeared in an official UK Labour video, filmed in Ladbroke Grove, saying that the party could \u201cgive young people hope\u201d. At the beginning of the clip, there\u2019s a glimpse of Grenfell, which went up in flames the following year.\n\nWhat motivated him, at the time, to do the video for Team Corbyn? \u201cI dunno, man,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt like he was the best of a bad bunch.\u201d He thought that voting for Labour was \u201cthe only way\u201d to shift the government \u201cover to the fair side a bit\u201d. The #grime4corbyn campaign he says was \u201cvery cheesy\u201d, but even though it helped to mobilise a generation, he is disappointed about its outcome. \u201cIt actually helped him a lot and I feel like he didn\u2019t capitalise on it,\u201d says Tracey of the Labour leader. \u201cHe didn\u2019t utilise what he had.\u201d\n\nThe video has left a faintly bitter taste but, if it came to it, with a quick election looking ever more likely, Tracey would do it again. \u201cNot for Labour, though,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I\u2019m voting for anyone now it\u2019s the Green party. Corbyn is a great guy and his morals are in the right place but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s strong enough to be our leader.\u201d And the less said about Boris, the better. \u201cHe\u2019s just an idiot, innit,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to be the big man, but he\u2019s a very small man.\u201d\n\nCould British MCs get together and galvanise young people again in that way? \u201cStormzy could make everyone mobilise,\u201d says Tracey. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that could do it. If Stormzy ran for prime minister, he\u2019d stand a chance of winning, I swear to God.\u201d\n\nAnd if he was in charge himself? The first thing he\u2019d do is \u201ctackle climate change, hard\u201d, he says. \u201cI\u2019d put a massive tax on cars that aren\u2019t eco-friendly and I\u2019d do some kind of initiative where you can come and get your car scrapped and maybe get free travel in exchange.\u201d\n\nFor now, at least, the latter might be achievable. Tracey says he isn\u2019t so bothered about courting the US music industry \u2013 his focus is on his home turf. \u201cI haven\u2019t conquered the UK yet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I have, then we\u2019ll talk about America.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, there are those two massive sell-out gigs to contend with, which led him to jokingly tweet recently: \u201cCan I come to someone\u2019s house for dinner tonight, I spent all my money on Ally Pally production?\u201d\n\nThese are the little-shown downsides of being a modern-day independent artist, but Tracey remains philosophical. \u201cI\u2019m going minus [figures] for these shows,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to invest in myself, you know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\nWith thanks to Keystone Crescent members bar, King's Cross.
