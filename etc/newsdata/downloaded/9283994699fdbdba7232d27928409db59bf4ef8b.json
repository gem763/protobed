He entered without fanfare about eight minutes before first pitch, only spotted by a few in the crowd.\n\nAD\n\nThe trip to the ballpark was the first time Trump attended a Washington sporting event since becoming president. He has not eaten at a Washington restaurant beyond those in his own hotel and has skipped traditional social events such as the Kennedy Center Honors and White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner.\n\nThe Nationals had sought to keep politics out of their first trip to the World Series and did not invite Trump, who decided to come and then arranged the logistics with Major League Baseball, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nAfter his brief introduction, Trump was largely a non-presence in the ballpark .\n\nPresidents often throw out the ceremonial first pitch when they attend a baseball game, but that honor Sunday instead went to chef and humanitarian Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, who has faced off with Trump in court over scuttled plans to build a restaurant in the Trump International Hotel and has criticized many of Trump\u2019s policies. Andr\u00e9s received a loud ovation when he appeared on the field before the game.\n\nAD\n\nThe presidential limo pulled up into a tunnel below home plate, and the president and First Lady emerged shortly after 8 p.m., whisked into an elevator by Secret Service and up to luxury box 119, along the third base line. Trump was accompanied by the First Lady, his daughter Ivanka Trump and an all-Republican cohort, including Sens. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and David Perdue (Ga.), Texas Reps. Mac Thornberry, Kevin Brady, Kay Granger, and John Ratcliffe and Reps. Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), Steve Scalise (La.), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Matt Gaetz (Fla.).\n\nAD\n\nTrump was expected to meet with a group of wounded veterans during the game, a White House aide said.\n\nDuring the fifth inning, two men held up signs that read, \u201cVeterans for Impeachment\u201d at their seats directly behind home plate. The men, Alan Pitts and Naveed Shah, said they are Iraq veterans who are with Common Defense, an organization for veterans who are against the Trump administration.\n\nAD\n\nThe \u201cVeterans for Impeachment\u201d sign behind home plate pic.twitter.com/5THxQoCn39 \u2014 Dan Steinberg (@dcsportsbog) October 28, 2019\n\n\u201cOur oath didn\u2019t end when we left active duty,\u201d Pitts said. \u201cWe still defend it today, and Congress needs to do the same. They need to step up and hold the president accountable for his illegal and unconstitutional acts.\u201d\n\nBecause signs of a certain size are permitted in the ballpark, \u201cWe\u2019re not breaking any rules that we\u2019re aware of. We would hope that they\u2019re not kicked out for that,\u201d said Alex McCoy, a Marine Corps veteran with the group. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to assert our first amendment rights.\u201d Other veterans from Common Defense planned to be in attendance, too, but not in the visible section behind home plate \u2014 \u201cWe could only afford the two tickets\u201d there, McCoy said. The group declined to say how much it paid for the seats, but World Series tickets in prime sections cost thousands of dollars.\n\nAfter Pitts and Shah showed their signs, Pitts said security told them to take them down, and fans around them reacted angrily, including a man in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat who told the pair they would \u201chave a big problem\u201d if they got close to him and his friends. They were able to remain at the game.\n\nThe Nationals and Major League Baseball leadership were reluctant to discuss the president\u2019s visit. Chased down a hallway in the bowels of the ballpark, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred declined to comment on his golf outing with Trump on Saturday at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. \u201cI\u2019m not talking,\u201d he said before boarding a freight elevator where Secret Service dogs were sniffing nearby.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNationals General Manager Mike Rizzo, wearing a blue-and-white-striped shirt on the field before the game, was also not interested in talking about Trump.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he\u2019s sitting,\u201d Rizzo said with a smile before walking into the Nationals\u2019 dugout a minute later.\n\nAsked twice if Trump was invited by the team to attend, he declined to say. \u201cI\u2019ve got to worry about going 1-0 on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to worry about.\u201d\n\nNationals pitcher Stephen Strasburg said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Trump to come but that it had turned the clubhouse into an unusual atmosphere.\n\n\u201cUsually the dogs that are sniffing in our clubhouse are these nice Labs that are super friendly. And today there was a German Shepherd that I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable petting,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAndr\u00e9s, on the other hand, was a welcome presence at the game.\n\nAD\n\nAs the Astros took batting practice, singer Pedro Capo, whose song, \u201cCalma,\u201d has become a Nationals anthem of sorts, hung out behind home plate. He had an Astros glove in his hand and a red Nationals towel in his back left pocket.\n\n\u201cAs a Puerto Rican, I\u2019m always going to be grateful to Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s,\u201d said Capo, who was thrilled that the chef who fed his island during Hurricane Maria would be there to throw out the first pitch. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s doing it again in the Bahamas. That speaks of the class act he is.\u201d\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s appearance, Capo shrugged. \u201cHey, it\u2019s the World Series, you know? You got to come. That\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump was expected to leave before the end of the game, aides said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The president was met with boos from the crowd when he was shown on the video board between the third and fourth innings.", "authors": ["Maura Judkis", "Reporter Covering Culture", "Food", "The Arts", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/L_uZvsxUtX_b1-Tya_qJs7c3Who=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SBA3JIXZEQI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
