Wibbitz\n\nCalifornia's largest utility says it could shut off power to 500,000 people this week for two days or longer as wildfires again threaten to bring havoc to northern parts of the state.\n\nThe warning addressed residents in 15 counties, most in the Sierra foothills and the San Francisco Bay area. It came less than two weeks after gusty winds, high temperatures and parched conditions forced Pacific Gas & Electric to shut off power to 2 million people, many for several days.\n\nThat preemptive outage, or Public Safety Power Shutoff, fueled outrage from many residents and political leaders. Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the energy giant of \"greed\" and mismanagement.\"\n\nPG&E, however, defends the outages as crucial to the safety of its customers. The company already has filed for bankruptcy after being held liable for tens of billions of dollars in damages resulting from deadly wildfires blamed on downed power lines.\n\nThe company has given preliminary notification to more than 200,000 homes and businesses impacting several hundred thousand residents.\n\nSOURCE Pacific Gas & Electric; maps4news.com/\u00a9HERE (Photo: USA TODAY)\n\n\"Weather conditions, including potential fire risk, have been forecast that may impact electric service to portions of our service area,\" PG&E said in a statement, adding that it will \"attempt to notify impacted customers at the phone number or email on file 48 hours before, 24 hours before and just before power is expected to be shut off.\"\n\nIn Southern California: Hillside brush fire in Los Angeles threatens affluent Pacific Palisades homes; evacuations lifted\n\nThe utility said authorities have determined more than half of PG&E\u2019s 70,000-square-mile service area in Northern and Central California have a high fire threat, given dry grasses and the high volume of dead and dying trees. The state\u2019s high-risk areas have tripled in size in seven years, the statement said.\n\nCLOSE Wildfires in California and other western states are getting worse every year, but is climate change all to blame? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\n\u201cThe sole purpose of PSPS is to significantly reduce catastrophic wildfire risk to our customers and communities,\" said Michael Lewis, senior vice president for operations. \"As we saw in the last PSPS event, we had more than 100 instances of serious damage and hazard on our distribution and transmission lines from wind gusts of this strength.\"\n\nSouthern California has not been spared the wildfire conditions, and firefighters have been conducting fierce battles in recent days to protect homes. Southern California Edison said it was monitoring conditions but had no immediate plans to cut power.\n\nConsider this: California power lines spark wildfires and prompt blackouts. Why not just bury them?\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/22/new-round-pge-power-shutoff-northern-california-wildifres/2449314001/", "description": "California's largest utility says it could shut off power to 500,000 people this week as wildfires again threaten to bring havoc to 15 counties.", "authors": ["John Bacon", "Published A.M.
