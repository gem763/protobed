Nicole Scherzinger (left) appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show on Thursday and revealed a slang term she learned in Australia. But do Aussies actually use it?\n\n'I learned a new word in Australia. So, this is what's keeping me motivated. I learned \"sula\". Does anyone know what a sula is?' Nicole said.\n\n'If you don't have a sula, you're not working hard enough. A sula is a sweaty upper lip alert. So, you've got to work so hard.'\n\nThe talent show judge motioned to her upper lip, explaining that sweat indicates effective training - while continuing her questionable Australian accent.\n\nOkay Nicole! 'If you don't have a sula, you're not working hard enough. A sula is a sweaty upper lip alert. So, you've got to work so hard' she explained\n\nAwkward!

We've got ourselves a sula... Sweaty upper lip alert!' Poppy says.\n\nNo sula here! Nicole was in Sydney to film Australia's Got Talent earlier this year. She noticed how Australian say 'heaps' instead of 'lots of'\n\nKelly praised Nicole's Australian accent, prompting a self-aware Nicole to reply: 'It's rubbish! But thank you, anyway!'\n\nEarlier in the episode, the 41-year-old proved she had picked up on how Australians often use the word 'heaps' instead of 'lots of'.\n\n'The Australian accent is good times guys. It's heaps, heaps of fun!' Nicole said.\n\n'It's sexy! It's sexy!'
