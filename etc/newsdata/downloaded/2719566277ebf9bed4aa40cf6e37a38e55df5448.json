That in itself nearly had me blowing a gasket as the parent of a high-functioning autistic child we have kept pharmaceutical free. There are better ways of dealing with the condition\u2019s challenges.\n\nCompensatory damages of $680,000 had already been awarded. The $8bn was the punitive element, although the money still goes to Mr Murray (and his lawyers).\n\nPunitive damages are, in America, an established principle of common law, but verdicts like this one nonetheless makes them the cause of controversy.\n\n\u201cGrossly disproportionate\u201d is how the company described the verdict, noting the vast gulf between it and the compensatory award. It will appeal (obviously) and the consensus is that it stands a high chance of getting the number reduced. That\u2019s what has happened with some of the numbers that similarly runaway juries have come up with in the past.\n\nMore\u2019s the pity. In a system where regulators are derided and too often have their hands tied by politicians who can too easily be bought, such verdicts have a purpose.\n\nThey are an important means by which companies can be called to account when they, their actions and/or their products hurt people.\n\nThere are innumerable instances where corporations have sold and marketed bad products in the full knowledge of their badness because of the financial imperative. Tobacco is but one example.\n\nAn aggressive legal system, populated by aggressive lawyers capable of producing verdicts like this one, should at least provide companies with the motivation to ask an important question: should we do this? Do the potential risks outweigh the rewards?\n\nJohnson & Johnson is a financial juggernaut. It generated $82bn in revenue last year. The \u201cNo 1 on Working Mother\u2019s 100 Best Companies\u201d list (I quote from its website) has sought to build a reputation as a brand trusted by doctors, nurses, patients.\n\nBut its recent history suggests that it hasn\u2019t been asking that question often enough.\n\nIn August it was ordered to pay $572m after a judge in Oklahoma found the company intentionally played down the dangers and oversold the benefits of opioids in a major trial related to what has become an American public health crisis.\n\nIt has also faced multimillion-dollar verdicts related to pain plaintiffs say was caused by its vaginal mesh implants. Another case with a verdict in the billions involved 22 women who alleged that its talc products caused them to develop ovarian cancer.\n\nThe legal authorities in this country tend to look at at the American system with its torts, class actions and supposed ambulance chasers hustling big verdicts, with something akin to horror.\n\nBut you can easily make the case that the big verdicts pursued by pugilistic law firms are, in fact, in the public interest, even that we could do with some of them over here.", "description": "It\u2019s the sort of verdict the size of which even John Grisham might think twice about including in one of his legal thrillers.\u00a0 Johnson & Johnson was hit with an $8bn\u00a0(\u00a36.5bn)\u00a0penalty by a real-life \u201crunaway jury\u201d over its marketing of an antipsychotic drug, Risperdal, which has the unfortunate potential side of effect of causing male users to develop breasts.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/27/13/pri81716937.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
