It became apparent that mainstream is struggling with underfunding and overcrowding - teachers are incredibly tested.\n\n\"It's not their fault the way things are - the system is not working.\"\n\nImage caption Charlotte Church was once known as the \"voice of an angel\" and sang across the world at star-studded events\n\nThe idea is part of The Awen Project, which she has set up and hopes will grow into a charity to set up other independent schools.\n\nPupils would be given a say over the rules of the new school as well as how lessons would be delivered, what food they eat, and how they travel to school.\n\nMs Church has spent the past 18 months visiting schools across the UK.\n\nShe said: \"We're trying to create something really based on everything we know about how humans learn best.\"\n\nMs Church will teach music and intends to send both her children - Dexter and Ruby - to the school.\n\n\"I totally believe in the transformation of the whole education system and I want to play an active part in making that change,\" she told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\n\n\"How are we supposed to be creating a new society if all we're doing is imposing on children what we say is important?\n\n\"Just because they are younger than us, they still have a voice in society and a right to be listened to.\"\n\nDinas Powys Community Council objected to the proposal as being \"detrimental to the character\" of the area.\n\nCouncillor Andrew Robertson said some neighbours were concerned over the impact of traffic and noise.\n\nVale of Glamorgan council is set to make a decision this month.\n\nHow easy is it to set up your own school?\n\nOnce the money has been secured for a property and to pay teachers, any new school must be registered and inspected, according to which part of the UK it is established.\n\nThe process for setting up a new school - for five or more pupils of compulsory school age (5-16) - is rigorous but has been streamlined, so it usually takes little more than a year from approval to the school opening its doors.\n\nUnder law, all schools must reach required standards of education, \"spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of students\", the welfare, health and safety of students and the premises and accommodation at the school. They must also establish a complaints procedure for parents.\n\nHowever they do not need to comply with the national curriculum and are free to teach what they like, as long as it does not contravene laws, such as those ruling against inciting racial hatred.\n\nNor do they have to offer the same qualifications. In fact many have opted for the international baccalaureate rather than A-levels, though most primary age schools do take part in national tests.", "description": "The singer says mainstream education is \"struggling\" with overcrowding and under-funding.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AA63/production/_96691634_153851783.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
