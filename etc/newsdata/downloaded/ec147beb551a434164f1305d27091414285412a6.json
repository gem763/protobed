The pair divorced in 2000 and Moore revealed that she thought Willis was afraid she would make their dissolution dreadful for him.\n\n\u201cI think Bruce was fearful at the beginning that I was going to make our split difficult, and that I would express my anger and whatever baggage that I had from our marriage by obstructing his access to the kids \u2014 that I\u2019d turn to all of those ploys divorcing couples use as weapons,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t, and neither did he.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cRough Night\u201d actress admitted that her breakup from Willis \u201cwasn\u2019t easy at first,\u201d but added that they both made a concerted effort to redirect the \u201cheart of our relationship, the heart of what created our family, into something new that gave the girls a loving, supportive environment with both parents.\u201d\n\nThe move ended up working out for the former flames as Moore would write that the exes \u201cfelt more connected than we did before the divorce.\u201d Moore even attended Willis and wife Emma Heming's wedding vow renewal ceremony in March.\n\nDEMI MOORE SAYS SHE 'LOST' HERSELF AFTER ASHTON KUTCHER SPLIT\n\nMoore\u2019s account of her admirable and seemingly mature breakup from Willis is a stark comparison to the \u201cnightmare\u201d she described as her divorce from second husband Ashton Kutcher, now 41.\n\n\u201cSeparating from Ashton was just a nightmare for her. It took her years to get over it,\u201d a source told People. \u201cShe was always very insecure about their age difference and it was devastating that Ashton left her.\"\n\n\u201cIt really played havoc with her self-confidence,\u201d added the source. \u201cDemi was confused about her life and what direction her career would take as she got older.\u201d\n\nMoore also accused the \u201cPunk\u2019d\u201d co-creator of mocking her alcohol addiction and claims Kutcher humiliated her with drunk pics during their relationship.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe former couple began their romance in 2003 when they met during a dinner with mutual friends. The pair would marry two years later, separated in 2011 and were formally divorced in 2013.\n\nThe actress previously said she spoke with Kutcher, who's now married to and shares two kids with Mila Kunis, about the claims in her book.\n\nFox News' Jessica Sager contributed to this report.", "description": "With juicy details emerging daily from Demi Moore\u2019s memoir, the latest tidbit the actress opens up about is her public split from Bruce Willis when the two were at the height of Hollywood fame.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/demi-moore-bruce-willis-sl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
