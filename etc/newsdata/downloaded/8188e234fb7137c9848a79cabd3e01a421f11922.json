But, investors are keeping an eye on the stock since Boeing\u2019s board of directors ousted CEO Dennis Muilenburg from the Chairman position at the beginning of this month.\n\nMuilenburg, however, remains the CEO. But, the current issues surrounding the seven-month grounding of the 737 MAX and how Boeing will deal with the situation do cast uncertainty over the upcoming earnings release.\n\nThough the fourth quarter has begun, the company has failed to act on its claims to get the 737 Max back on the runway. Meanwhile, American Airlines AAL confirmed that software updates to the 737 MAX will help the plane takeoff by the end of this year. But, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration believes that the company will face issues with the proposed software fixes to the aircraft\u2019s flight control systems.\n\nSo, the fate of the 737 MAX hangs in the balance. Boeing\u2019s overall commercial aircraft shipments, by the way, have declined 67% in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis to 63 jets, thanks to the 737 MAX aircraft issue. This also doesn\u2019t bode well for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company\u2019s third-quarter earnings release. Lest we forget, Boeing\u2019s revenues had dropped nearly 35% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, thanks to a 54% drop in shipments.\n\nFor the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $19.34 billion. A year ago, sales were $25.14 billion. Commercial airplane supply has also declined sharply in recent times, since delivery of 737 MAX has been stopped. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company\u2019s third-quarter commercial revenues is pegged at $8.57 billion, suggesting a 43.9% decline from the prior-year number.\n\nBut, not all segments are expected to perform badly. After all, Boeing\u2019s Defense, Space & Security segment delivered 77 military aircraft in the third quarter, up 114% from the second-quarter level. Such positive developments should get reflected in the third-quarter revenue numbers.\n\nLooking beyond the 737 MAX, Boeing\u2019s third-quarter earnings results might also show the impact of an after-tax charge. In the second quarter, the company had reported an after-tax charge of $4.9 billion, which reduced its income by $5.6 billion.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, higher material cost might also affect its earnings results for the third quarter. U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum from China are cited to be the reasons driving material costs. When Boeing reports results, it\u2019s expected to post adjusted earnings per share of $2.04, down from $3.58 in the prior-year quarter.\n\nStory continues", "description": "As Boeing and Lockheed approach Q3 earnings, let us look at who are positioned to score higher.
