REUTERS/Omar Sobhani\n\n\u201cA major troop withdrawal must be contingent on a final peace,\u201d the nine wrote on the website of the Atlantic Council, a think tank. \u201cThe initial U.S. drawdown should not go so far or so fast that the Taliban believe they can achieve military victory.\u201d\n\nThe nine, including five former ambassadors to Kabul, a former special envoy to Afghanistan and a former deputy secretary of State, issued their warning a day after U.S. chief negotiator Zalmay Khalilzad announced a draft accord with the Taliban for an initial drawdown of nearly 5,000 U.S. troops. [nL3N25T2IR]\n\nKhalilzad, speaking on Monday to Tolo News television in Kabul, declined to say how long the rest of the roughly 14,000 U.S. troops would stay. But U.S. officials repeatedly have said the pullout would be \u201cconditions based.\u201d\n\nIn exchange, the Taliban would commit to preventing their decades-long ally, al Qaeda, or other extremists from using the country as a springboard for new attacks.\n\nTrump has made clear his impatience to withdraw all U.S. forces and end America\u2019s longest war, which began with a U.S. invasion triggered by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that al Qaeda launched from then Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\nKhalilzad said Trump must approve the draft before it can be signed.\n\nKhalilzad excluded Kabul from the nine rounds of U.S.-Taliban talks in Qatar. But he has said it would be part of negotiations on a political settlement with the Taliban, which has so far refused to meet directly with Afghan officials.\n\nMaintaining a major U.S. troop presence would have \u201ca critical influence on the chances for successful peace negotiations,\u201d the former diplomats wrote.\n\n\u201cIt is not clear whether peace is possible. The Taliban have made no clear statements about the conditions they would accept for a peaceful settlement with their fellow Afghans, nor do they have a track record of working with other political forces,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThere is an outcome far worse than the status quo, namely a return to the total civil war that consumed Afghanistan as badly as the war with the Russians and something that could follow a breakdown in negotiations if we remove too much support from the Afghan state, they wrote.\n\nA new civil war \u201ccould prove catastrophic for U.S. national security\u201d as it likely would see the Taliban maintain their alliance with al Qaeda and allow Islamic State\u2019s growing local affiliate\u201d to further expand, they said.", "description": "Nine former U.S. ambassadors on Tuesday warned that Afghanistan could collapse in a \"total civil war\" if President Donald Trump withdraws all U.S. forces before the Kabul government and the Taliban conclude a peace settlement.", "authors": ["Jonathan Landay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425818688&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821I4"}
