That time is long gone.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason so many of those apocalypse dramas include a loss of comms. If your phone fails these days, everyday life can quickly follow suit.\n\nWhich is why, when Three\u2019s network functionality seemed to collapse out of the blue late on Wednesday evening, it is fair to say that Thursday did not go well for thousands of the business\u2019s 10.1m active customers.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWith precious little information available (to those with wifi at least) as to what was going on, why and how it would be resumed save some inappropriately sassy tweets, the response from many paying clients was fury.\n\nBut this is not the first time British consumers have experienced widespread service failures.\n\nAnd while some were turning to Twitter to voice their disbelief at the scale of the reaction, for others, being unexpectedly unable to connect to the outside world could have tangible repercussions on work and private life, including financial ones.\n\nHere are your rights and the best ways to complain if that includes you. If not, maybe file it somewhere for the next time the apocalypse comes around.\n\nReasonable care\n\nThe expectation that the services you pay for will work properly and consistently is enshrined in law under the Consumer Rights Act 2015. It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.\n\nIf it isn\u2019t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it\u2019s probably not huge amounts, unless you\u2019re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that you\u2019re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone\u2019s usual functionality. For example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn\u2019t transfer money.\n\nKeep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.\n\nWriting to the business involved rather than calling so you have records of evidence, outline the problems you had, the costs you incurred and provide the evidence. Then clarify what you want the business to do about, remembering to state that you are seeking redress because of a breach of the Consumer Rights Act 2015.\n\nDo it as soon as you can, if only to avoid the queue. You could also complain directly to the CEO. They are unlikely to respond personally but your complaint will be dealt with in a different way to standard customer services complaints.\n\nOn this latest outage itself, Ofcom, the communications industry regulator, says that while no-one can guarantee an entirely fault-free service, your provider should be working hard to maintain the level of service they promised.\n\n\u201cIn more extreme cases, where repairs take much longer (for example it takes longer than usual to access a mast site to undertake repairs), you may be entitled to an additional refund or account credit.\n\n\u201cIn cases where you have been without service for some time, you may also have the right to leave the contract without penalty. There may be a term in your contract saying you can do this if your provider has failed in its obligations to you or breached a key condition.\u201d\n\nHelen Dewdney, a consumer affairs specialist and author also known as The Complaining Cow, believes that few people will be significantly out of pocket from this week\u2019s hiccup, but the bizarre and slow response from Three could have a knock-on effect.\n\n\u201cThree customers on Twitter are saying that they have been pleased with the company\u2019s service for years and can forgive them for this downtime,\u201d says Dewdney. \u201cBut they are unimpressed with the speed with which it acknowledged the problem and the lack of clarity about the issue and when it will be fixed. Three really needs to improve its customer service and communications if it doesn\u2019t want to lose customers over this.\u201d\n\nRegularly cited as one of the UK\u2019s more reliable networks, Three\u2019s share price had slipped as news of the outage emerged but finished up by the end of the trading day.", "description": "Once upon a time a day\u2019s outage of a mobile phone network would not have been headline news.
