Ms Allen\u2019s arrival brings the Lib Dem tally in the Commons to 19.\n\nMs Swinson said she was \u201cin discussions\u201d with potential switchers and \u201calways hopeful of further defections\u201d, but declined to say whether new recruits were in the pipeline.\n\nAnd Ms Allen, who has been sitting as an independent since quitting Change UK in June, said she was \u201cabsolutely\u201d in touch with serving Tory MPs who shared her concerns over the direction the party was taking under Mr Johnson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying everybody should casually resign the whip, but for me it was the right thing and I know that in other MPs\u2019 hearts they know it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has got to be at least 20.\u201d\n\nAsked if she expected any to follow her, she replied: \u201cI couldn\u2019t say for sure that any will. I\u2019d like to say yes, but one of the things that\u2019s disappointed me most since I became an MP is the lack of bravery that there is.\u201d\n\nMs Swinson said she had been working with her new MP for \u201ca long time\u201d on issues like the campaign for a Final Say referendum, and the pair have been \u201cin close contact\u201d over a possible defection since Ms Allen left Change.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

His approach is to attack the Labour heartlands instead. But you win elections on the centre ground.\u201d\n\nMs Allen was marked out as an independent voice on the Tories\u2019 centrist wing from her maiden speech in the Commons, when she was critical of the party\u2019s approach to welfare \u2013 something she admits \u201cprobably limited my opportunities for promotion\u201d.\n\nA former entrepreneur, who put her business on hold to enter politics, said she was attracted by the compassionate and pro-business agenda pursued by the coalition government under David Cameron.\n\n\u201cThe Conservative Party since then has changed beyond recognition,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that I have changed at all, it is the party that has changed irreparably. The party that I joined doesn\u2019t exist any more. It is self-imploding, it is turning into the new Brexit Party.\u201d\n\nAnd she said it was a \u201cvery, very risky\u201d question whether the Conservative Party would even survive its current traumas.\n\n\u201cThe loud, bullying voices of the European Research Group have been allowed to capture the party and push it to the precipice of a no-deal Brexit, which would be unbelievably damaging for our economy, our society and our Union. Anybody who shares \u2018One Nation\u2019 values does not have a home there any more.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, she said the Lib Dems under Ms Swinson offer \u201can incredibly positive beacon for what our future could be\u201d, not only on Brexit, but also social justice, compassionate welfare and honesty over spending on the NHS and social care.\n\nMs Allen\u2019s defection was announced hours after the latest talks between opposition leaders seeking a means to prevent no-deal Brexit broke-up without progress on the key issue of the leadership of a possible caretaker government to extend Article 50 talks.\n\nMs Swinson said there were still \u201cconstructive\u201d discussions happening, but said that if Labour stuck to its position that only Jeremy Corbyn could head a temporary caretaker administration, then \u201cit won\u2019t happen because we know what the numbers are of people unwilling to back him \u2013 not just Liberal Democrats but also rebel Conservatives and the increasingly large number of MPs who have left Labour or are still in the Labour Party but cannot contemplate Corbyn in No 10\u201d.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader said she could name \u201ca dozen\u201d MPs who could fill the role of caretaker PM, but said this was only one of a number of routes open to those opposing no deal.\n\nProgress on issues like the Benn Act, to prevent Mr Johnson opting for no deal without parliamentary approval, had been made not in meetings of opposition leaders but in a wider group including rebel Tories and Labour backbenchers, she pointed out.\n\nStressing that the Lib Dem door remains open to future defectors, Ms Swinson said: \u201cIt remains the case that there are lots of MPs who are unhappy with the current direction of both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn and who share our values of internationals and a fairer and more inclusive society and want to stop Brexit and create a more positive future for our country.\n\n\u201cObviously, I hope more of them will be joining us, but these things happen in their own time.\u201d\n\nAsked if she was actively talking with potential defectors, she replied: \u201cI\u2019m always in discussions.\u201d", "description": "Former Conservative MP Heidi Allen has been unveiled as the latest recruit to the Liberal Democrats, declaring that at least 20 more \u201cOne Nation\u201d Tories\u00a0would like to follow suit. Ms Allen told The Independent the Tory Party no longer offered a home for MPs from its centrist tradition, though she admitted she did not know if any would have the \u201cbravery\u201d to jump ship.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/19/front-7-10-19-heidi-allen-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
