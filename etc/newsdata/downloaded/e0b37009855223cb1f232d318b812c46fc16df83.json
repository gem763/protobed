(Picture: BBC)\n\nHe proceeded to talk to Ryan-Mark, he added: \u2018Young man you remind me of a weathercock, it turns in the direction of the wind, tell me why I shouldn\u2019t fire you?\n\n\u2018Riyonn, every time I point something out, you have a way of wriggling out of it and I don\u2019t see you as my business partner and because of that you\u2019re fired.\u2019\n\nThe events manager from London was the fifth candidate to leave, and despite being \u2018gutted\u2019, he told Metro.co.uk that some of the scenes were edited out.\n\nHe laughed: \u2018They did show a few of my dumb moments, but that\u2019s just me without my phone, but I wasn\u2019t worried about the edit as I came across as who I am.\n\n\u2018When we did the safari, we did a tour with all the animals and I had no idea what the animals were so I thought \u201cthat\u2019s going to make me look great on TV isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u2018\n\nRiyonn struck up an unlikely friendship with Thomas (Picture:BBC)\n\nRiyonn went on to explain that he didn\u2019t feel like he should have been fired from the show so soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I definitely think someone else should have gone, I was clearly meant to be his business partner,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018If not his business partner I was hoping to land in the top five, but I think it was because of the way I went about it. I put myself forward as project manager all the time, I got stuck in and I didn\u2019t want to sit in the background so I was put on the chopping block a lot more compared to other people.\n\n\u2018Our team did lose but I wasn\u2019t to blame for a lot of losses and out of that task, in general, I wasn\u2019t the weakest link. I point my finger to Ryan-Mark because he scoots along and that\u2019s how some people play the game but that\u2019s not how I wanted to play it.\n\n\u2018I was hoping he would go but I got that finger instead.\u2019\n\nThe 30-year-old admitted that the boardroom goes on for a full day so, in actual fact, a lot of it is cut from the show.\n\nLast week Lubna Farhan was fired, and since leaving the show she revealed that her boardroom scene was cut completely.\n\nRiyonn also felt several of the candidates \u2018played up to the camera\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018A lot does get edited from the show but I am not worried as I feel like I left with my head held high.\n\n\u2018I won\u2019t say anyone in particular but on and off camera with certain characters there is a big difference and as soon as the cameras roll, they are 100% more amped up than normal and I would say \u201cguys why don\u2019t you just be yourself, why do you have to be different on camera?\u201d but I guess that\u2019s how they wanted to play it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I think that\u2019s why it was more frustrating because they came across as good, but then off-camera they weren\u2019t that way in person.\u2019\n\nThe Apprentice continues Wednesday at 9pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
