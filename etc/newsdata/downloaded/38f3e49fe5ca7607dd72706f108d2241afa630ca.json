Laws in New York State also invoke the \u201cgreat expense to the community\u201d of impounding and destroying these strays, who are described as a health hazard and \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d In New York City, the Mayor\u2019s Alliance for N.Y.C.\u2019s Animals states that desexed animals \u201clive a longer, healthier life,\u201d that males will be \u201cbetter behaved\u201d if they don\u2019t have testicles, and that spaying females \u201chelps prevent breast cancer and uterine infections.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s good for us, and it\u2019s good for them.\n\nAt first glance, insofar as spay-neuter practices have been aimed at overpopulation, they appear to have been an indisputable success. The number of animals arriving at shelters has reduced appreciably since the 1970s; the number of euthanasias has plummeted, to two to four million euthanized cats and dogs annually now from estimates of more than 20 million back then.\n\nThis triumph, though, is asterisked. Specific numbers are very hard to come by, given the vagaries of reporting. A 2018 report by Andrew Rowan, then chief scientific officer of the Humane Society, and Tamara Kartal, of Humane Society International, suggests that the 1970s figure was much less, closer to 13.5 million \u2014 and cites many other societal changes as significant in lowering euthanization rates. Critically, there are now much higher rates of adoptions, better \u201ccontainment\u201d (fewer pet dogs just let loose to run around), and better identification methods, which allow for reunion of lost dogs with their owners.\n\nStephen Zawistowski, a former science adviser for the A.S.P.C.A., who has looked at the intake rates in the A.S.P.C.A. in New York City since it was founded in the 19th century, told me that \u201cthe largest decrease in dogs and cats coming into the city happened in the \u201940s, \u201950s and \u201960s\u201d \u2014 before spay-neuter became common and well before it became law. In some areas, studies have found that the opening of a subsidized spay-neuter clinic had no effect on local rates of euthanasia.\n\nMore troubling, despite the unambiguous statements made by proponents of the salutary effects of spay-neuter on dogs, a series of long-term research programs has begun to show that the effects are far more subtle \u2014 and sometimes outright damaging. Benjamin Hart, a researcher and veterinarian at the University of California, Davis, has led the biggest effort to date to see exactly what the repercussions of desexing might be, in the long term, using the database from his university\u2019s veterinary hospital. By removing dogs\u2019 reproductive organs, gonadectomies also remove their main source of hormones \u2014 estrogen, testosterone and progesterone \u2014 each of which has a role not just in reproduction, but systemically through the body.\n\nThe first publication by Dr. Hart and his team, in 2013, reported that desexing golden retrievers, especially before six months of age, increased their risk of serious joint diseases, four to five times over the risk intact dogs face. They have since found higher rate of joint diseases among desexed Labrador retrievers, German shepherds, Doberman pinschers, Bernese mountain dogs and St. Bernards. Risks of cancer increase multifold in spayed goldens, neutered boxers and all Bernese. Desexed dogs of all types suffer higher rates of obesity. One of the most touted claims of spay-neuter \u2014 that it increases an animal\u2019s life span \u2014 may be tempered by the finding that with an increased life span comes an increase rate of life-taking cancers.\n\nNot all breeds suffer more cancer or disease with desexing: small dogs and mixed breeds appear to be exempt. Desexing at later ages, too, may eliminate the increased risks of disease in some cases. Problematically, shelters like to desex at a young age \u2014 because that\u2019s often when they have possession of the puppies.", "description": "Spaying and neutering puppies shouldn\u2019t be standard policy \u2014 and it isn\u2019t automatically the \u201cresponsible\u201d choice either.", "authors": ["Alexandra Horowitz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/03/opinion/03Horowitz/03Horowitz-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
