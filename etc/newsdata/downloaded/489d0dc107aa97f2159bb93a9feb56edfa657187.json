Seventy-five people were in the room -- roughly two-thirds lawmakers -- for a hearing that many lawmakers said was jaw-dropping.\n\n-- ANDREW DESIDERIO and KYLE CHENEY: \u201cThe diplomat, William Taylor, painted a damaging portrait of events that directly tied Trump to a quid pro quo with Ukraine, according to his prepared remarks obtained by POLITICO and his responses to questions as described by sources in the room for the closed-door testimony.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NYT\u2019S PETER BAKER: \u201cMr. Taylor\u2019s vivid depiction illustrated the differences between the impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump and the ones that consumed Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. While the Watergate and Monica Lewinsky cover-ups involved the integrity of America\u2019s democracy and system of justice, the Ukraine scandal also extends to matters of life and death, as well as geopolitics on a grand scale.\u201d NYT \u2026 NYT\u2019s \u201c6 Key Revelations\u201d \u2026 Taylor\u2019s opening statement\n\n-- WAPO\u2019S DAN BALZ: \u201cNew testimony undercuts Trump\u2019s claim of no quid pro quo on Ukraine. How will Washington respond?\u201d: \u201cIt is no longer a question of whether this happened. It is now a question of how the president explains it and how lawmakers \u2014 especially Republicans \u2014 choose to respond to it. \u2026\n\n\u201cRepublican lawmakers face a new calculus as they digest the contents of the Taylor testimony. They will have great difficulty denying that the suspension of the aid was being linked to an investigation of a political rival of the president. Will they conclude that what the president did was legitimate? Will they attempt to point in other directions? Will they argue that what Trump did wasn\u2019t right but isn\u2019t impeachable? There\u2019s less room for equivocation about what happened today than there was before.\u201d WaPo\n\n2) DITCHED \u2026 CBS\u2019 NANCY CORDES asked Senate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL on Tuesday if he told the president -- as TRUMP claimed -- that the Ukraine conversation was perfect. MCCONNELL: \u201cWe\u2019ve had not any conversations on that subject.\u201d So, was he lying? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask him. I don\u2019t recall any conversations with the president about that phone call.\u201d\n\n3) SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IOWA) told reporters he\u2019s \u201cgrowing more alarmed that time will run out to get the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement passed through Congress this year. \u2018I\u2019m very worried for the first time, starting about now,\u2019 the Iowa Republican said on a call with reporters.\u201d Megan Cassella and Adam Behsudi for POLITICO Pro subscribers\n\n4) AMBASSADOR JAMES JEFFREY -- Trump\u2019s envoy to Syria and a former ambassador to Turkey and Iraq -- accused the Turks of a war crime and said no one consulted him about pulling troops out of Syria.\n\n5) REPUBLICANS ABANDONED TRUMP over his invoking \u201clynching\u201d in talking about the constitutional process of impeachment. WSJ editorial page\n\n6) AN ANONYMOUS TRUMP AIDE has written a tell-all book about his time in the White House. It\u2019s going to come out Nov. 19 -- less than one month from now.\n\n-- BTW \u2026 A FEW THOUGHTS ON THIS BOOK: IF THIS PERSON alleges he or she witnessed illegal behavior and is declining to go to authorities, isn\u2019t that quite problematic? \u2026 AND if this book was written by a current administration official, they\u2019d probably have to file that they had an agreement for a book on their financial disclosure form.\n\nPOMPEO\u2019S DILEMMA -- On Tuesday, the White House called the State Department diplomats who have testified in recent days \u201cradical unelected bureaucrats.\u201d Might this include Taylor, a fellow West Point graduate who fought in Vietnam and has served administrations of both parties? He was last appointed ambassador to Ukraine by George W. Bush.\n\nPOMPEO ASKED HIM to come out of retirement to replace Marie Yovanovitch, another State Department veteran who was ousted amid a campaign of rumors that have been discredited. At some point, does Pompeo stand up for his own diplomats? Or is he that unwilling to get crosswise with Trump?\n\nA message from Google: In the last year, web searches for medication disposal have increased by 30 percent.

Pelosi is lashing McConnell for sitting on House-passed legislation addressing gun violence and ethics reforms; McConnell says Pelosi has done nothing to follow through on her claims that the House won\u2019t come to a \u2018standstill\u2019 during impeachment.\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s certain things that we have to do. And I don\u2019t have any doubt that we can work with each other,\u2019 McConnell said in a brief interview. \u2018Her problem at the moment is internal [in her caucus], not with us, but how to manage that whole process and how can we fit other things in it.\u2019 Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill shot back: \u2018The majority leader knows as much about what goes on in the Democratic Caucus as he does about passing legislation: absolutely nothing.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But from the White House perspective, there has been little to be looped into.\u201d WSJ\n\n-- TEA LEAVES \u2026 WSJ\u2019S @RebeccaBallhaus: \u201cTrump met with members of his legal team\u2014Jay Sekulow and Marty and Jane Raskin\u2014at the White House today [Tuesday] for a brief meeting on the state of play of the impeachment inquiry. Rudy Giuliani wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\n-- WAPO: \u201cProsecutors flagged possible ties between Ukrainian gas tycoon and Giuliani associates,\u201d by Matt Zapotosky, Roz Helderman, Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey: \u201cIn July, the tycoon [Dmytro Firtash] changed legal teams, replacing longtime Democratic lawyer Lanny Davis with the husband-and-wife team of Victoria Toensing and Joseph diGenova, who appear frequently on Fox News to defend Trump and have served as informal advisers to Trump\u2019s legal team, including Giuliani.\n\n\u201cAfter taking on Firtash\u2019s case, Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face-to-face meeting with Attorney General William P. Barr and other Justice Department officials to argue against the charges, three people familiar with the meeting said. Barr declined to intercede, the people said.\u201d WaPo\n\n-- \u201cThe Investigation Into Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Associates Has Widened,\u201d by BuzzFeed\u2019s Michael Sallah, Jason Leopold and Emma Loop: \u201cA federal grand jury investigating activities surrounding Rudy Giuliani\u2019s back-channel campaign in Ukraine has demanded legal documents that include records of extravagant spending at Trump hotels and millions of dollars in financial transfers by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two key operatives who carried out the plan, according to a source familiar with the demand.\n\n\u201cThe documents requested by a subpoena that was issued in Florida last week could shed light on whether other people, including foreign nationals, were trying to influence the top levels of government and impact the 2020 presidential campaign.\u201d BuzzFeed\n\nSCOOP ...

It sent out a fundraising solicitation, but some of the cash came in organically, it said.\n\n-- SCOOP: NATASHA KORECKI: \u201cDick\u2019s Sporting Goods CEO quietly tests presidential bid\u201d: \u201cEd Stack, the CEO of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe prospect of a well-funded, third-party candidate could have a significant impact in a race where Trump is expected to be unable to win a majority of the vote. In 2016, Trump won just 46% against Hillary Clinton and has consistently hovered below 50% in national polls. A source familiar with Stack\u2019s thinking said, \u2018Mr. Stack enjoys running Dick's Sporting Goods and has no plans to run for any elected office.\u2019\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- HAPPENING TODAY: Wisconsin poll alert: The well-regarded Marquette Law School Poll is out today at 1:15 p.m. Eastern time, with results released at a live event that will be streamed here and tweeted at @Mulaw.

Russia is also prodding states in the region to recognize, either explicitly or tacitly, the Syrian government\u2019s authority, analysts said.\u201d WaPo\n\nANOTHER WILD TRUMP AMBASSADOR STORY -- \u201cIn Hungary, a Freewheeling Trump Ambassador Undermines U.S. Diplomats,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Matt Apuzzo and Benjamin Novak: \u201cSince becoming ambassador in June 2018, Mr. [David B.] Cornstein has assiduously courted Mr. Orban, giving the Hungarian leader unexpected influence in the Trump administration. Mr. Cornstein used his decades-long friendship with President Trump to help broker a coveted Oval Office meeting for Mr. Orban last May \u2014 a meeting now under scrutiny by impeachment investigators in Washington.\n\n\u201cAt the time, some White House officials tried to stop the meeting, citing Mr. Orban\u2019s anti-democratic record in Hungary and his growing closeness to Russia. The meeting went ahead, and Mr. Orban is said to have used it to fuel the president\u2019s suspicions about Ukraine.\n\n\u201cAs yet, Mr. Cornstein\u2019s role in that meeting does not appear to be part of the impeachment inquiry. But his freewheeling diplomacy and courtship of Mr. Orban have alarmed career civil servants and contributed to broader criticism, even among Republicans, that some members of the president\u2019s foreign policy team are dangerously unprepared for the job.\u201d NYT\n\nDON\u2019T DO CRIMES, KIDS -- \u201cMajor Donor to Trump, Clinton to Plead Guilty in Campaign-Finance Case,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s Byron Tau: \u201cA major donor to both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made millions of dollars of illegal campaign contributions, some from foreign sources, to help cultivate influential U.S. politicians, according to charging documents filed Tuesday by federal prosecutors in California.\n\n\u201cCalifornia businessman Imaad Zuberi, 49 years old, capitalized on his access to U.S. politicians to drum up business from foreign governments and foreign individuals, whom he later defrauded as part of a scheme to enrich himself, prosecutors say.\n\n\u201cMr. Zuberi will plead guilty to making illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion and falsifying lobbying records to conceal his work for foreign governments, according to charging documents filed in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

That defeat, inflicted by MPs who wanted more time, stops the passage of the bill in its tracks.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in more than three years since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, a majority of British MPs accepted an exit plan, a boost for [Boris] Johnson who had faced some skepticism in Brussels that he had the support of the House of Commons. However, he will now miss his self-imposed deadline of delivering Brexit by October 31 and must rely on EU leaders to grant a delay.\u201d POLITICO Europe\n\nBOOK CLUB -- \u201c\u2018The White House is not to be trusted right now\u2019: How Jim Mattis, \u2018iced out\u2019 and blindsided by Trump, finally concluded the president was weakening the nation,\u201d by Bryan Bender: \u201cThe book is the first account from inside the highest reaches of the Pentagon of how Trump has remade the American national security apparatus, reporting that Mattis respected the president for having highly tuned political skills but came to believe his policies were undermining the nation.
