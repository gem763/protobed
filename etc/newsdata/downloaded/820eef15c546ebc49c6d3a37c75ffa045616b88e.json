It was the first time this season where we have had to defend for large periods. We have dominated the other games but today we saw a (United) team that could defend in their own half,\u201d said the Norwegian.\n\n\u201cThey (Leicester) are a good side who want to get into the top four. To keep a clean sheet is great but let\u2019s not get too excited because we know we can play better. We defended as a proper team,\u201d he added.\n\nLeicester boss Rodgers felt his side had merited more.\n\n\u201cI thought we deserved something from the game. We didn\u2019t start well but we had a great chance to take the lead,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe gave away a soft penalty and that ultimately decided the game. In the second half, we played well and it looked like it was coming but we couldn\u2019t find that last pass.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United moved up to fourth place in the Premier League after a Marcus Rashford penalty gave them a 1-0 win over Leicester City at Old Trafford on Saturday.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429835797&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8D0KG", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
