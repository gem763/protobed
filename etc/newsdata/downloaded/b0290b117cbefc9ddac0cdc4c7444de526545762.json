Come early to catch the picturesque chamber flooded with morning sunshine spotlighting the royal pavilion that sits inside.\n\nOutdoorsy travelers can camp in a park bungalow or opt for more luxe accommodations in the nearby touristy town of Hua Hin, three hours by car or four by train from Bangkok.\n\n___\n\nLOPBURI FOR THE HISTORY BUFF\n\nBypass the tour groups at the ancient city of Ayutthaya and head two hours north of Bangkok for a more serene stroll through Thai history.\n\nLopburi, one of Thailand\u2019s oldest cities, boasts Khmer-era temples and the uncrowded ruins of King Narai\u2019s Palace, built in the 1600s.\n\nIt\u2019s also known for the mischievous monkeys that gather at Phra Prang Sam Yot temple in the center of town. Pro tip: Keep a safe distance from the monkeys and hide anything you don\u2019t want them to steal.\n\n___\n\nGETTING AROUND:\n\nA car rental costs about $20 (U.S.) per day, and an international driver\u2019s permit is required. You can also hire a driver at most major car rental companies, book a taxi or explore by train.\n\nBe sure to have Google\u2019s maps and translate apps at the ready.\n\n___\n\nFollow Nicole Evatt on https://www.instagram.com/nicoleevatt/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Thailand's southern beaches lure travelers with their turquoise water and dramatic limestone cliffs, but there's more to explore in the Southeast Asian country that's one of the world's most popular destinations.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Nicole Evatt"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/09/travel-get_outta_here-thailand_29143_c0-334-4000-2666_s1770x1032.jpg?10173bc06c9e7df4d87e02e0d2be93a21ca3611e", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
