But world powers fear the Turkish action could exacerbate the conflict, and run the risk of ISIS prisoners escaping from camps amid the chaos.\n\n\u201cOur heroic commandos taking part in Operation Peace Spring are continuing to advance east of the Euphrates,\u201d the Defence Ministry wrote on Twitter on Thursday, posting a video showing soldiers firing rifles in darkness as they advanced.\n\nA witness in the Turkish town of Akcakale said volleys of rockets were fired from there across the border into Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad. Smoke rose from two targets hit on the Syrian side of the border, he said.\n\nTurkish forces shelled targets near Ral al Ain on Thursday morning, and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters responded, another witness said.\n\nThe Turkish military has hit 181 targets of the Kurdish militia with its air force and artillery since the start of operation into northeast Syria, the ministry said.\n\nOne of the prisons where ISIS detainees are held was struck by a Turkish air strike, the SDF said on Twitter.\n\nThe U.S. military has taken custody of two high-profile Islamic State militants previously held in Syria by the SDF and moved them out of the country to a secure location, a U.S. official said.\n\nA second U.S. official said they belonged to a group of British fighters nicknamed \u201cThe Beatles,\u201d who have been tied to the murder of Western hostages.\n\nAkcakale was quiet for much of the morning after sporadic gunfire and the sound of tank movement were heard in the early hours, Reuters journalists said. Explosions had rocked Tel Abyad earlier in the night, they said.\n\n\u201cOperation Peace Spring is continuing as planned across the border,\u201d Turkey\u2019s Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. Turkey regards the Kurdish militia as a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish PKK militants waging a decades-old insurgency in southeast Turkey.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nTroops entered Syria at four points, two of them close to Tel Abyad and two close to Ras al Ain further east, according to Turkish media reports.\n\nAir strikes killed at least five civilians and three SDF fighters, while dozens of civilians were wounded, the SDF said. Thousands of people fled Ras al Ain towards Hasaka province, held by the SDF.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said on Twitter that the group\u2019s fighters had repelled a ground attack by Turkish troops in Tel Abyad.\n\nSECURITY COUNCIL MEETING\n\nPresident Trump called the Turkish assault a \u201cbad idea\u201d and said he did not endorse it. He said he expected Turkey to protect civilians and religious minorities and prevent a humanitarian crisis - as Turkey has said it would.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet on Thursday to discuss Syria at the request of the five European members, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland.\n\nIn a letter to the 15-member Council seen by Reuters, Turkey said that its military operation would be \u201cproportionate, measured and responsible.\u201d\n\nThe 22-member Arab League said it will hold an emergency meeting on Saturday.\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday, Trump defended U.S. policy towards Kurds, saying Washington had spend \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d arming and funding them.\n\n\u201cThe Kurds are fighting for their land...As somebody wrote in a very powerful article today, they didn\u2019t help us in the Second World War, they didn\u2019t help us with Normandy as an example... But they were there to help us with their land, and that\u2019s a different thing,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cWith all of that being said we like the Kurds.\u201d\n\nBut one of Trump\u2019s closest fellow Republican allies, Senator Lindsey Graham, said failing to support the Kurds would be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency\u201d and unveiled a framework for sanctions on Turkey with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nSmoke rises over the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain, as seen from the Turkish border town of Ceylanpinar, Sanliurfa province, Turkey, October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nThe Syrian Kurdish group was for years Washington\u2019s main allies on the ground in Syria and the incursion was potentially one of the biggest shifts in years in the Syrian war that has drawn in global and regional powers.\n\nThe Kurds played a leading role in capturing territory from Islamic State, and now hold the largest swathe of Syria outside of the hands of President Bashar al-Assad.
