Initial statement of the Chinese side is moderate. This is China's habit. It doesn't mean China's real attitude is not positive. \u2014 Hu Xijin \u80e1\u9521\u8fdb (@HuXijin_GT) October 14, 2019\n\nBloomberg News had reported on Monday that China had not yet confirmed some of the specifics of the deal, including the plan for China to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of agricultural goods. Bloomberg News also reported that China also wants the U.S. to scrap a tariff hike scheduled for December.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday morning that he expected those tariffs would still be applied if the U.S. and China had not reached a final deal by then.\n\nBloomberg and CNBC both reported that China wants another round of talks before the \u201cphase one\u201d deal would be signed.\n\nTraders on Wall Street took note of the seemingly different tones taken by the Trump administration and Chinese state media outlets. For example, initial reports in China noted \u201csubstantial progress\u201d had been made but stopped short of calling it a \u201cdeal.\u201d", "description": "A confusing morning of mixed signals coming out of China about the trade deal struck with the U.S. last week. | Economy", "authors": ["John Carney"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-872031456-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
