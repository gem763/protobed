Developed by SoulPancake and Funny Or Die, its the type of intensely sincere watch that\u2019ll have you thinking for hours after watching.\n\nSarah Silverman has already made headlines for her honestly in the film, opening up about the amount of prescription medication she took as a child to deal with anxiety.\n\n\u201cI was put on Xanax at 13,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just upped the dose\u2026 until I was taking four Xanax four times a day.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s really only part of Silverman\u2019s commentary in the documentary, and all of the comedians, from Chris Gethard to Rachel Bloom to Wayne Brady to Anna Akana, and on and on and on, offer some incredibly touching insight into the realities of anxiety, depression, and mental health.\n\n\u2018Laughing Matters\u2019 conveys as best it can that these feelings are universal.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, too, in its own way, because it\u2019s full of comedians. But comedians trade daily in honesty, and it\u2019s the honest interviews throughout that really make an impact.\n\nRainn Wilson, who founded SoulPancake and helped organise the documentary, told Newsweek he turned to comedy as an outlet to help him deal with depression and anxiety.\n\n\u201cI grew up a pretty anxious and depressed kid. I had a family that looked normal on the outside but was completely dysfunctional. I was this odd, alienated child. My mom took off when I was 2-years-old. I was raised by a step mom and this was a petri dish for sadness. When I found that I could make people laugh. That was my solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have these kind of fucked up things that happen to us,\u201d he says later.\n\n\u201cAnd we can get through it. And use it.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/chch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
