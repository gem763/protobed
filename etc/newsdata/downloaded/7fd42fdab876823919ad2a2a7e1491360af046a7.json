From open-air villas to an adult treehouse, we explore all the places that you should book for an unforgettable getaway.\n\nLaunay Castle, Le Mans, France on Vrbo: Every little girl knows that, when it comes to fairy tales, it\u2019s not the gorgeous gowns, the charming prince, or even the talking wildlife that makes the story. The most important aspect of the princess life is the castle. Well, queen, don your tiara and get ready to give the people your best regal wave because Launay Castle outside of Le Mans, France, is ready and waiting for your royal visit.\n\nRomance is woven into the very history of this posh estate. In the 16th century, two aristocrats committed the ultimate scandal\u2014they fell in love. But not everyone\u2014ahem, the good lady\u2019s mother\u2014was on board with their relationship. So, Charles de Coesmes did what he had to do and he kidnapped his amour Gabrielle d\u2019Harcourt, who was in on the abduction. They found sanctuary at Launay Castle, the home of Charles\u2019 friend and accomplice. For this crime of passion, Gabrielle\u2019s mother convinced the King of France to decree that both men involved in the bride-napping should be publicly decapitated. Eventually, all was forgiven, heads did not roll, and everyone was welcomed back at court.\n\nNow, for the not-so-princely sum of just over $920 a night, you can temporarily move into Launay Castle in the French countryside to live out your very own fairytale romance complete with a\u2014wait for it\u2014moat. (You read that right. Consider all of your princess fantasies officially fulfilled.) Launay Castle may look charming and quaint on the outside, but on the inside it is all spacious luxury. The eight bedrooms in the main palace can sleep 16, while two additional friends of your choosing can be banished to the guest house.\n\nYou may not have a Mr. Carson to show you around (butlers are strictly BYO), but as you will surely see as you run through the halls of your palace, this is not your grandma\u2019s castle. Parts of the structure were built as early as the 14th century, but a restoration with an eye towards preserving the vintage charms while bringing things into the 21st century have added a little modern flair. But there is one recurring wall art theme that will continue to remind you of the home\u2019s medieval roots: we\u2019re talking old-school woven wall tapestries everywhere you look.\n\nLike all good European country homes, Launay Castle is all about the wide open, remote spaces. The heated swimming pool is divine, of course, but when you start venturing beyond the confines of your moat you will get a sense for what this castle really has to offer. There are 36-acres of tree-lined paths, orchards full of fruit for the picking, and a pond stocked with fish, all ready for Your Majesty\u2019s enjoyment.\n\nBut not all vacation days are best spent holed up on your own luxurious estate. When you\u2019re feeling the urge to step off your private grounds and explore your domain, this Loire Valley location has plenty to offer. You can walk the charming streets of the village Sarthe near your castle, or indulge in the favored pastime of all royals throughout history\u2014horseback riding. Or choose one of two enjoyable hops: a wine hop to taste the best fruits of the land or a hop among the rival castles in the area. (It\u2019s always good to keep an eye on the competition.) And when the mood strikes, jump on the high-speed train and zip along to Paris in under an hour.\n\nWe live in the 21st century when princesses aren\u2019t quite as plentiful as they used to be. But that doesn\u2019t mean, for one long and dreamy holiday week, that you can\u2019t pretend that your cupboard is full of crown jewels and Launay Castle is your very own palace. Just don\u2019t let the royal life go to your head; fairytales do come true, but unless you\u2019ve been saving up some of that \u201cI\u2019m going to buy a castle\u201d money, they also come to an end.\n\nBook Your Stay: Launay Castle in Le Mans, France: $921/night via Vrbo", "description": "The Daily Beast presents a look at one of the most insane houses in the world.", "authors": ["Allison Mcnearney"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1686,w_2996,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567888576/190816-MCNEARNEY-OMG-I-WANT-TO-RENT-THIS-HOUSE-France-hero_wvjeil", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
