That should not have to be said!' Said one.\n\n'That's f*****g gross. Hands down no amount of bleach that could ever make that okay,' said added.\n\nOne commenter said they agreed even if the creators of the cake had attempted to make the tester more hygienic, it still was deeply unappealing.\n\n'I don't even like bringing food into a bathroom let alone putting a whizz stick on the food... even if they bleached it that is still uncomfortable and not appetising in any way,' they wrote.\n\nOthers said they as far as they were concerned the same effect could have been achieved by making the topper out of fondant.\n\n'Maybe the pregnancy stick is just very realistic fondant? Somehow I doubt that though,' said one hopeful commenter.\n\nWhile commenters weren't against the couples' joy per se, they were upset the cake was topped by a positive pregnancy test which may have contained traces of urine (stock)\n\n'I guess it's fine just for a prop photo but they could've just had one made out of frosting,' said one.\n\nAnother added: 'A malformed fondant pregnancy test would be better.'\n\n'Who wants to be thinking about that when they go to have some cake?' Asked another.\n\nA few said aside from the pregnancy test topper, they were upset the person had written 'we're pregnant' on the cake as it appeared old fashioned.\n\nI hate that 'we' sh*t. She's pregnant, 'we' are going to have a baby,'' said one.\n\nWhile another said: 'I get irrationally bothered by people saying 'we're' pregnant when referring to a couple in which one person is carrying the child.'", "description": "A photo showing a cake topped with a pregnancy test result is causing outrage.
