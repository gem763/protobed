I feel special.\"\n\nThe Japanese royal family commands relatively broad support, although polls suggest the younger generation is less interested in the monarchy.\n\nA poll released by national broadcaster NHK on the eve of the ceremony found 70 percent of voters in the country hold \"friendly or favourable\" views towards the imperial family.\n\nBut despite the support, the monarchy that is sometimes described as the world's oldest faces other concerns, particularly succession.\n\nEmperor Naruhito and Empress Masako have one child, a 17-year-old daughter named Aiko. But imperial rules allow only a man to ascend the throne, and royal women lose their titles if they marry a commoner.\n\nWith Naruhito's ascension, his brother Akishino is now crown prince. And Akishino's son - 13-year-old Hisahito - is currently the only other remaining successor.\n\nThe question of altering the succession rules has been raised - NHK found 74 percent support the shift - but no formal moves have yet been made to make the changes.\n\nThe Prince of Wales attended a banquet at the Imperial Palace in Tokyo which marked the Emperor's first official engagement.", "description": "Japan's Emperor Naruhito completed his ascension to the Chrysanthemum throne  in a ceremony steeped in the traditions and grandeur of a monarchy that claims 2000 years of history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8905/1e6520a321514fb386c4da7129a5b213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
