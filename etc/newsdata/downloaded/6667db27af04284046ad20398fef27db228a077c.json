It\u2019s crazy how I\u2019m still with them without being there physically.\u201d\n\nWithout the daily grind of management to restrain him, Johnson has spent the months without basketball traveling with his family, tending to his thriving business interests, and giving time to his church. He\u2019s still advising - Johnson recently consulted with his bishop at West Angeles Church of God in Christ on the sale of some its properties. The deal will help the church build its Family Life Center for its nearly 20,000 weekly attendees. The West Angeles Church also paid the mortgage on its cathedral with the sale and was able to establish a financial reserve.\n\nJohnson and his family have been members of the church led by Bishop Charles E. Blake for years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous accomplishment itself that an African-American pastor, a bishop can say to us as a community and congregation that, \u2018we own our church.\u2019 I think what you\u2019ll see is that others will follow,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFrom that sale, we\u2019re able to build our family life center. So many community services will be established because of the family life center. When he asked me to help out, I was very willing to do that and to advise him and the other members that he chose to make sure they were making the right decisions and moves.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s wife, Cookie, joined the church about 20 years ago and the basketball Hall of Famer soon followed her and found a deeper connection with his faith. Blake and Johnson have teamed on various projects to help improve inner cities, launched programs designed to strengthen black families and spearheaded relief efforts in cities hit by hurricanes or other natural disasters.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get more involved with my church and working with Bishop Blake,\u201d Johnson told The Associated Press. \u201cWhen you think about his spiritual vision and plan, as well as what he had in mind in terms of his business plan for the Crenshaw corridor, it\u2019s in line with what I\u2019ve been doing in my business. I share his vision and want to just work with him and for him to see how we can improve the community.\u201d\n\nJohnson recently toured a hospital in Newark, New Jersey, that boasts a greenhouse designed to boost wellness initiatives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really amazing what the hospital is doing for the community,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. I\u2019ve been around the country doing the same thing and that\u2019s what God has called me to do. I just want to go out and bless other people.\u201d\n\nHe stunned the Lakers when he abruptly quit in April, not even telling owner Jeanie Buss or general manager Rob Pelinka before he announced his decision to reporters at the regular-season finale. Johnson, who had been investigated four times by the NBA for tampering, fought off tears as he explained his decision was made in part because he wanted \u201cto go back to having fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be there every game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not a guy who goes backward in terms of saying, \u2018yeah, I miss it.\u2019 I love the Lakers. I miss the interaction with Jeanie every day. I miss being at the practices.\u201d\n\nBut without his break from the NBA, Johnson said he wouldn\u2019t be able to spend weeks in Europe with his wife to celebrate both of their 60th birthdays. He also has ownership stakes in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles FC and attended a baseball playoff game on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still a Laker,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a Laker. I\u2019ll always help the Lakers. I\u2019m pulling for us to win the championship this year. But when I stepped down, it allowed me to do so much more that I wanted to do. The Lakers are in great hands.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers had missed the postseason in each of their three springs since Johnson and Pelinka took over, and not even the addition of LeBron James last year could end the playoff drought. But the addition of Anthony Davis has made the Lakers a contender to win the Western Conference.\n\nHe\u2019ll keep an eye on the Lakers - all while making the commitment to church and community. Included in the sale was the caveat that bars, cannabis businesses, strip clubs and other nuisance business were banned from being built on the property.\n\n\u201cI brought Starbucks there on Crenshaw so there was a place where people could meet other people,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut what the church was able to do was 100 times even bigger than bringing Starbucks there.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Magic Johnson might actually miss the Los Angeles Lakers if he wasn't always checking up on them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dan Gelston"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/magic_moves_on_basketball_84658_c0-155-4973-3054_s1770x1032.jpg?44ef7162ab3c55922cf7f6782a39517004d774e3", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
