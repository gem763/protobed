But a now-cancelled pilots\u2019 strike has led British Airways to cancel hundreds of flights to and from London Heathrow \u2013 costing an estimated \u00a320m.\n\nMembers of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa) staged a two-day strike on 9 and 10 September, triggering losses of around \u00a3100m. Pilots had also planned to walk out on 27 September, but nine days ago the industrial action was called off.\n\nHowever, by then BA had cancelled the vast majority of its flights \u2013 to give advance warning to passengers, and to avoid paying compensation under European air passengers\u2019 rights rules by providing 14 days\u2019 notice.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

One reason appears to be the complexities of crewing rosters, and another is the likelihood that many would be half-empty and therefore unprofitable as well as damaging for the environment.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
