REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao/File Photo\n\nOil prices surged nearly a fifth at one point following the strikes on two plants, which knocked out more than 5% of global oil production. Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group claimed responsibility, but the United States blamed Iran.\n\nThe Norwegian crown surged as much as 0.7%, then settled at 8.964 crowns NOK=D3 against the dollar, up 0.3% on the day. It was also 0.3% ahead versus the euro EURNOK=D3.\n\nThe Canadian dollar rose 0.2% to C$1.3259 CAD=D3. The Russian rouble RUB= was also higher.\n\nThe currencies of oil importers such as Turkey TRY= and India INR= underperformed.\n\nOverall, the forex market reaction was limited. A bigger concern was that a supply-side shock and growing geopolitical tensions would damage an already fragile global economy, MUFG analyst Lee Hardman said.\n\n\u201cDownside risks for the global economy would intensify if geopolitical risks in the region continued to escalate, creating a more unfavorable environment for high beta emerging market and high yielding currencies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Japanese yen, a common choice for investors seeking shelter from market uncertainty, rose 0.2% to 107.85 yen per dollar JPY=EBS. The Swiss franc rallied versus the euro but was only up 0.1% at 1.0959 EURCHF=EBS by 0730 GMT, suggesting some calm had returned to markets.\n\nThe U.S. dollar slipped 0.1% against a basket of currencies .DXY. It was little changed versus the euro at $1.1079 EUR=EBS.\n\nCHINA WEAKNESS\n\nIn China, data released on Monday showed industrial output grew in August at its slowest pace in more than 17 years and retail sales rose less than expected. That added to pressure for stimulus, and in offshore trade the Chinese yuan CNH=EBS weakened 0.3% to 7.0653 per dollar.\n\nThe market focus on Monday was the Middle East, but attention will also remain on central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Expectations the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates on Wednesday had lessened; now investors are sure they\u2019ll fall and are divided only over how much.\n\nA third of economists polled by Reuters expect the Bank of Japan to announce ramped-up stimulus on Thursday. But sources say it may be a close call \u2014 policymakers will wait to assess market reaction to the Fed\u2019s decision hours earlier.\n\nJapanese markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday.\n\nSterling, which has soared over the past week on growing investor confidence that a no-deal Brexit is off the table, fell 0.3% to $1.2466 GBP=D3. It was down 0.5% against the euro at 88.970 EURGBP=D3.", "description": "Currencies linked to the price of oil rose on Monday after an attack on Saudi Arabian refining facilities disrupted global oil supplies, while the Japanese yen and Swiss franc strengthened as nervous investors sought safety.", "authors": ["Tommy Wilkes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430376513&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0HP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
