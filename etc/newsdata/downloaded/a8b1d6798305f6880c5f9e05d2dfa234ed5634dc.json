She was 80.\n\nBest known for her role as Rhoda Morgenstern on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d and its spinoff \u201cRhoda\u201d in the 1970s, Harper was diagnosed with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, a rare and incurable form of brain cancer, in January 2013.\n\nGabriel Olsen/Getty Images Harper arrives at the 14th Annual Movies for Grownups Awards Gala on Feb. 2, 2015, more than two years after her terminal diagnosis.\n\nWhen the actor, who had battled lung cancer in 2009, learned of her terminal diagnosis, she told People magazine that the finality of it \u201chit me like a sledgehammer.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Incurable\u2019 is such a concise word. I was terrified,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCancer makes real what we try to obscure from ourselves,\u201d Harper added. \u201cWe spend our lifetimes thinking, \u2018I\u2019m never going to die.\u2019 But cancer says, \u2018Hey, not so fast.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn November 2015, Harper made her first public appearance after that hospitalization at the Glioblastoma Multiforme Heroes Awards, where she told Entertainment Tonight, \u201cListen, I was supposed to be dead in three months, maybe six, because of the kind of cancer I had. It\u2019s a toughie.\u201d\n\nCBS Photo Archive via Getty Images \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" highlighted women's changing roles in the 1970s.

After nabbing several small parts in the late \u201950s and \u201960s, Harper landed the iconic role of Mary Tyler Moore\u2019s funny, earthy best friend in 1970. She left the original series in 1974, but continued to play Rhoda \u2015 a role that earned her four Emmys and one Golden Globe award \u2015 on the spinoff series until 1978.\n\nAfter that series wrapped, Harper went on to act in several made-for-TV movies before starring in two season-long sitcoms, \"Valerie\" and \"City,\" in 1986 and 1990, respectively. Over the years, she made notable guest appearances on \"Melrose Place,\" \"Sex and the City\" and \"That '70s Show.\" In 2000, she and Moore reunited for the TV movie \"Mary and Rhoda.\"\n\nHarper also continued to appear on stage, earning a Tony Award nomination for playing Tallulah Bankhead in \u201cLooped\u201d in 2010.\n\nHer last on-screen role was in the short film \u201cMy Mom and the Girl,\u201d which was released in October 2016.\n\nHarper is survived by Cacciotti and their daughter, Cristina.\n\nAntonia Blumberg contributed to this report.", "description": "The Emmy-winning actor died after a long battle with cancer.", "authors": ["Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569e64ae1a00005a00ab0d6f.jpeg?cache=w53lawdbq7&ops=1778_1000"}
