He called me his champion son,\u201d the 38-year-old said. \u201cBut then, as I started to discover who I am, things changed dramatically. When I was 17 going on 18, I told him that I was gay.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt split the family apart and we didn\u2019t speak for 10 years,\u201d he added.\n\nFortunately, the pair have since reconciled. In fact, the elder Brown was in the audience for the \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d episode that aired Monday. After the show, he spent time with his son\u2019s future husband, Ian Jordan, backstage.\n\nWitnessing his father\u2019s \u201cgrowth,\u201d Brown said, was a heartwarming experience.\n\n\u201cNever in my life did I think I would be on \u2018Dancing With the Stars,\u2019 with my father, who didn\u2019t accept me because I was gay,\u201d he told \u201cEntertainment Tonight.\u201d \u201cNow we\u2019re in a journey of healing. It blows my mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a young gay boy, I just wanted my father to love me for me, and he wasn\u2019t in the space yet to do it,\u201d he told \u201cAccess Hollywood.\u201d \u201cThe fact that, years later in my late 30s, he could finally come around and say, \u2018I love you and I support you,\u2019 was big for me.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Brown is hopeful that parents who may be struggling to come to terms with their LGBTQ children\u2019s sexuality or gender identity will find encouragement in his relationship with his father.\n\n\u201cI just hope that if there\u2019s any parent out there who is maybe in a space like my father used to be, maybe they can see him and use him as inspiration to reach out to their child,\u201d he said.", "description": "The \"Queer Eye\" star said his recent performance on \"Dancing With the Stars\" was an emotional one following his reconciliation with his dad.", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db19d9d210000d428ad3c97.jpeg?cache=7wezosol83&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
