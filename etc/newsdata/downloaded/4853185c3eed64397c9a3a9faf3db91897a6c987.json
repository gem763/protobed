Anyone caught using the closed stretch of road will be handed a \u00a31,000 fine.\n\nThe council say the lengthy detour is necessary as it 'has to be suitable for the type of traffic that would normally use the closed section'.", "description": "Motorists are being sent on a 41-mile diversion because of a 65ft stretch of roadworks.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Patrick O'Flynn", "Clive Aslet", "Stephen Pollard", "Michael Deacon", "Benedict Spence", "Tom Harris", "Douglas Carswell", "Joe Armitage", "Asa Bennett"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000213866521-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3M16awKal4hJihA3wX34GCh4hFjn1vRwkgmyundSZaQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
