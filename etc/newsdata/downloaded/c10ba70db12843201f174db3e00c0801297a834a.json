And boy, oh boy, did she regret it.\n\nThe Amazon customer left a one-star review on the painting, calling it \u201chideous\u201d and \u201ccomically off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis thing is hideous. His face is almost comically off. I look at the picture they have online here and then what is sitting on top of my book case and it is a DRAMATIC difference. It makes me laugh out loud, although I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been $80 worth of laughs so far. Hasn\u2019t been hung or mounted or placed anywhere because it\u2019s just so ugly. It haunts me in my room at night.\n\nI should have just bought the poster, I thought this would have been cool but\u2026I should have just bought the poster.\n\nLook at the picture I attached!\u201d\n\nThe \u201c24\u00d736 George Constanza Seinfeld REAL Oil Painting on Canvas, Handmade Not Printed\u201d is currently still listed on Amazon but has no price, however the customer claims they paid $80 for this work of art.\n\nHonestly, $80 is pretty cheap for any oil painting, even one that\u2019s comically off. It\u2019s still a pretty decent attempt at the Timeless Art of Seduction, much better than anything I could paint.\n\nThe work of art was featured in the 139th episode of Seinfeld, \u201cThe Package\u201d, And has been officially meme-ified on the internet in recent years.\n\nThe Amazon attempt at the classic painting went viral after Twitter user @sexy_riker shared it. It has since amassed a whopping 45,000 likes and 10,000 retweets, with many users calling it nightmarish and wondering why anyone would want the painting in their house.\n\nTherapist: Oil painting George Costanza isn\u2019t real it can\u2019t hurt you Oil painting George Costanza: pic.twitter.com/efOv24WZMq \u2014 spooky charm (@babyimbibibi) October 12, 2019\n\nI wanna know exactly what leads to a person searching \u201cGeorge Costanza oil painting\u201d on Amazon \u2014 Kakarot (@maxbyrd) October 11, 2019", "description": "An Amazon shopper was less than satisfied with their \"comically off\" hand-painted rendition of the George Costanza oil painting.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/george-costanza.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
