(Jeff Haynes/AP Images for Panini)\n\nThe major Week 2 injuries to top-line fantasy starters are going to be felt throughout the entire season. For owners of Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees, another quarterback is now a must, not an option.\n\nWith Week 3 upon us, I\u2019m here to help.\n\nWe\u2019ve combed the far reaches of the Internet and culled only the choicest fantasy tips and advice. Below you\u2019ll find easily digestible nuggets addressing some of the critical situations fantasy owners will face from week to week.\n\nDig in. And dominate.\n\n[Fantasy football start/sit Week 3: With Cam Newton banged up, avoid Panthers receivers]\n\nSleepers\n\nRex Burkhead, RB, Patriots: Quick quiz: Which New England running back leads the team in yards from scrimmage? Sony Michel? Nope. James White? Incorrect. Yes, it\u2019s Burkhead, and yet he remains widely available even after midweek pickups. Burkhead is available in 86 percent of ESPN leagues. So long as Michel continues to average a pathetic 2.8 yards per carry, Burkhead will continue to see a decent amount of touches. The Patriots host the Jets at home on Sunday. Without quarterback Sam Darnold, New York\u2019s offense is reliant on Le\u2019Veon Bell. Its defense will be without C.J. Mosley. All this bodes well for Burkhead\u2019s production. If you find yourself in dire need of an RB2/flex, Burkhead offers some appeal.\n\nNelson Agholor, WR, Eagles: Like Burkhead, Agholor is widely available. And the receiver figures to inherit a lot of targets with Philadelphia teammates DeSean Jackson (out two weeks with an abdominal strain) and Alshon Jeffery (calf) both injured. Agholor will be facing a solid Detroit defense. Still, some owners may need a wide receiver and Agholor has proven capable. He\u2019s available in 86 percent of ESPN leagues.\n\nFringe Starters\n\nJacoby Brissett, QB, Colts: Perhaps you own the aforementioned Roethlisberger or Brees, or maybe Cam Newton, who won\u2019t play in Week 3. Or perhaps you need a QB, or at least a second QB, to consider for byes and matchups in the weeks ahead. If Brissett is available, you shouldn\u2019t hesitate to grab him. He\u2019s played two road games and put up 20-plus fantasy points in each contest. Not too shabby. Brissett is available in 84 percent of ESPN leagues. Next up: a home game against an Atlanta secondary that so far has been solid. The Falcons\u2019 offense should hold its own in what could be a high-scoring affair, and Brissett has a strong chance to put up another 20-point week.\n\n[Week 3 fantasy football rankings]\n\nJarvis Landry, WR, Browns: Landry has provided very little to his owners thus far and that may not change this week. The Cleveland offense has not replicated the impressive play we saw during the second half of QB Baker Mayfield\u2019s rookie season. The Browns host the Rams on Sunday night, and the Los Angeles secondary has yet to allow a passing touchdown this season. Perhaps if this were a better matchup, Landry would be worth a roll of the dice, but until he produces, he has to be relegated to the bench.\n\nDemarcus Robinson, WR, Chiefs: Robinson\u2019s ownership skyrocketed (from 0 percent to 51 percent) following his performance in Week 2 (six receptions, 172 yards, two touchdowns). Pundits are getting on board. Kansas City plays its home opener Sunday against the Ravens. Baltimore\u2019s defense isn\u2019t as good as it was a year ago when the Ravens nearly upset the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium. The Ravens\u2019 secondary enters Week 3 a little beat-up after surrendering 349 yards passing to Arizona Cardinals rookie Kyler Murray last week. Most fantasy owners probably have enough depth that they\u2019ll be tempted to wait another week before inserting Robinson into their lineups. Others may not have that luxury or simply do not want to miss out on a potential big day. The lean here is that Robinson is worth a play. Baltimore will be without cornerback Jimmy Smith so Robinson gets another boost.\n\nInjury Decisions\n\nMark Andrews, TE, Ravens: While Andrews is officially listed as questionable with a foot injury, he is following the routine the team utilized leading up to Week 2\u2032s contest. His owners shouldn\u2019t be too concerned and Andrews has another good matchup vs. the Chiefs on Sunday.\n\nJames Conner, RB, Steelers: A knee injury forced Conner to sit out practice Wednesday and suddenly his fantasy season seems on shaky ground. If he goes, he is unlikely to be at full strength; add in playing with a new young QB and Conner\u2019s ceiling might be limited in Week 3. But Conner was not listed on Friday\u2019s injury report, having practiced in full both Thursday and Friday.\n\nT.Y. Hilton, WR, Colts: The Indianapolis wideout is listed as questionable as he is dealing with a quad injury.\n\nJosh Jacobs, RB, Raiders: Jacobs was a limited participant in practice Wednesday. While the rookie has produced nicely, he is going to have his hands full should he play in Oakland\u2019s road game at Minnesota. Jacobs was not listed on Friday\u2019s injury report, and while Sunday\u2019s matchup is hardly ideal, he would be a difficult player to bench given his production. At worst, it would seem he would be relegated to a flex spot. But expectations should be tempered.\n\nMarlon Mack, RB, Colts: Mack is dealing with a calf injury and missed practice Wednesday. The bad news is Mack is listed as questionable heading into Week 3. The good news is he practiced Friday, and while he could see a limited snap count, the expectation is he will play Sunday. Certainly monitor his status until game-time. Jordan Wilkins or Nyheim Hines would see an increase in touches if Mack is out or limited.\n\n[How to replace Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger in your fantasy football lineups]\n\nCam Newton, QB, Panthers: Newton has been ruled out for Week 3. The Cardinals would have been an appealing matchup, despite Newton\u2019s slow start. Kyle Allen will start in Newton\u2019s place.\n\nDavid Njoku, TE, Browns: It appears Njoku will be out at least a few weeks with a broken wrist, which landed him on IR on Friday. For those owners in need of a tight end, Jason Witten of the Cowboys (owned in 31 percent of ESPN leagues) might be an alternative for the Cowboys\u2019 Week 3 matchup with the Miami Dolphins. Another alternative going forward could be Chris Herndon of the New York Jets. He\u2019s suspended through Week 4 and could return in Week 5 when Darnold is expected to rejoin the club.\n\nDevin Singletary, RB, Bills: The promising rookie tailback suffered a hamstring practice in the fourth quarter of Buffalo\u2019s Week 2 win. He did not practice Wednesday and has been ruled out for Sunday. It\u2019s unfortunate since Singletary was on the cusp of becoming a weekly play. It\u2019s also unfortunate because Sunday\u2019s matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals looked awfully tasty for Singletary.\n\nTyrell Williams, WR, Raiders: The Oakland wideout has been dealing with a hip injury, but he is not listed on the team\u2019s injury report.\n\nRead more NFL news:\n\nBest bets for NFL Week 3: Bears, 49ers and Chiefs roll on\n\nLamar Jackson is off to a historic start but he\u2019s a bad bet to win NFL MVP\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive\n\nAntonio Brown released by New England Patriots amid NFL investigation\n\nEli Manning would lower the standard for Hall of Fame quarterbacks\n\nDrew Brees is out, but Sean Payton isn\u2019t saying who will replace him as Saints\u2019 starter\n\nNo matter what the NFL does, its officiating headaches just won\u2019t go away\n\nBen Roethlisberger out for the season, will have elbow surgery\n\nLamar Jackson will let you choose how he beats you\n\nThe Cowboys look like legitimate Super Bowl contenders\n\nSaints fans cry foul after yet another bad call: \u2018We just want answers\u2019", "description": "Jacoby Brissett is worth grabbing and Jarvis Landry is worth sitting, while a whole bunch of injury situations demand monitoring.", "authors": ["John Romero", "Multiplatform Editor", "Fantasy Football Reporter", "September At Pm", "John Arrived At The Washington Post In With A Diverse Skill Set That Continues To Grow.
