One called the testimony a \u201csea change\u201d that would \u201caccelerate\u201d impeachment. Another said Taylor provided the \u201cmost thorough account of everything so far\u201d.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThe central allegation in the inquiry is that Trump abused power by pressuring Ukraine to gin up bad news about Biden in exchange for a White House visit or military aid. In doing so, Trump twisted the immense powers of his office to personal ends in betrayal of constitution and country, his critics allege.\n\nCongress now has sworn testimony that Trump did so, despite his denials.\n\nGuardian read of the day\n\nUS envoy says Trump used military aid to push Ukraine to investigate Biden\n\nLine of the day\n\nEven before the Taylor testimony came to light, Trump let loose one of his wildest attacks on the impeachment inquiry yet, calling it a \u201clynching\u201d: \u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut we will WIN!\u201d Given Trump\u2019s history of racist remarks and his strategic use of cruelty, the tweet drew a chorus of outrage.\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\nTrump and his allies will face a wave of questions about their version of events. Congress planned to continue taking testimony this week. The Democrats are said to be zeroing in on the precise language of articles of impeachment.\n\nThe big picture\n\nTrump\u2019s impeachment remained a likely prospect, with majority support among Democrats in the House unchanged and the latest polls showing robust public support as well. But for Trump to be removed from office, about 20 Republican senators would have to defect, and there was no new sign on Tuesday of such a movement.", "description": "The president\u2019s denial of dirty dealings in Ukraine took a serious hit on Tuesday with Bill Taylor\u2019s closed-door testimony", "authors": ["Tom Mccarthy", "Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/581b779c395fb34495a3d07d4539c2ec2bf6100d/0_64_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=332a774d05426f4907189aeb2ccac0d7", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
