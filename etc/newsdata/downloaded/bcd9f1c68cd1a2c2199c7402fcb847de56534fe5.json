Scooter riders on crowded sidewalks have also caused problems.\n\nA dozen electric scooter companies have received more than US$1.5 billion in investments in total, according to a report issued earlier this year by Boston Consulting Group.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "The deal values the firm at US$2.5 billion before the investment", "authors": ["Jane Lanhee Lee"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bird.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
