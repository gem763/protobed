But, its lead researcher points out, the food can be made healthier, just as long as you strip the sauce and toppings, leaving yourself with a pathetic patty on a bun with a glass of water \u2014 to wash the dry mass down.\n\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, found that at the 34 fast-food chains they analyzed, the average combo meal contains 1,193 calories, and that the quantities of sodium, saturated fat and sugar are through the roof.\n\nTACO BELL TO REMOVE 9 ITEMS FROM MENU\n\nBut all a person has to do is hold the dipping sauce; remove toppings, such as cheese; and opt for water over soda \u2014 and you\u2019ll be good as gravy, says lead author Kelsey Vercammen of Harvard\u2019s T.H.
