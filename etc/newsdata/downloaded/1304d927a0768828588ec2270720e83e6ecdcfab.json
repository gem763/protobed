It\u2019s left a bitter taste in our mouth.\"\n\nBrazil will now go to Los Angeles where they face Peru on Tuesday, while Colombia play Venezuela in Tampa the same night.", "description": "Brazil share spoils with Colombia in entertaining 2-2 draw", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXNPEF86057_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
