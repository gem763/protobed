Popeyes' highly anticipated (and ridiculed and sexy) chicken sandwich, which sold out just two weeks after its debut, is officially returning to stores in early November.\n\nNovember 3 to be exact.\n\nPOPEYES TEASES 'BRING YOUR OWN BUN' CAMPAIGN, SUGGESTS CUSTOMERS MAKE THEIR OWN SANDWICHES\n\nPopeyes' press release confirming the news was as simple as the chicken sandwich itself, and contained only two words: \u201cI\u2019m Back.\u201d\n\nFranchise owners had tipped their hand about the sandwich\u2019s comeback last week, but the fast-food chain only confirmed the nationwide return in the Monday press release. Popeyes also debuted an advertisement for the sandwich's return that takes aim at its now-competitor Chick-fil-A, and the unavailability of their chicken sandwiches on Sundays.\n\nThe sandwich, which most fast-foodies are very much aware of at this point, was released in August and sold out two weeks later. It was then removed from menus across the nation while fans waited for the chain to announce a return date.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring that time, the sandwich sparked a Twitter beef between Chick-fil-A \u2014 which Popeyes seems intent on drawing out, according to its new marketing campaign \u2014 as well as an intense \"Chicken War\" that eventually grew to involve Buffalo Wild Wings and Wendy's.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the sandwich at the center of this controversy features a breaded chicken filet on a brioche bun, with pickles and either mayo or spicy Cajun spread.\n\nAnd it can (maybe) be yours stating Nov. 3 \u2014 because if history tells us anything, you might want to get there sooner rather than later.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS", "description": "Popeyes is making it official.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/popeyes-im-back.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
