Starmer said the election should be after the \u201cpassing and implementation of this act\u201d \u2013 and by \u201cimplementation\u201d he appeared to mean securing the Brexit extension beyond 31 October.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

If we can give them a little bit of extra rope \u2013 just let them be in power for a few more weeks, then people can really see how bad they are.\u201d\n\nBut waiting a few more weeks would miss the chance of an election before 31 October. It would mean \u2013 if the House of Lords passes the anti-no-deal bill into law \u2013 that the UK government would have to agree a Brexit extension before an election.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Tonight Corbyn and all Labour MPs abstained, which meant the election motion failed. But the Labour leader signalled that he wants to vote for it on Monday, if Hilary Benn\u2019s bill has obtained royal assent and become law by then.\n\nDeep textual analysis would suggest that Corbyn said he would back an election but didn\u2019t say on what date it should be. But it would be difficult, if the Benn bill does become law and Boris Johnson asks the Commons again to vote for an election on 15 October, for Corbyn to say that he didn\u2019t mean that election.\n\nIf the Benn bill is on the statute book, the Labour argument that they cannot trust the prime minister not to change the date of the election falls away. If Johnson delayed the election, he \u2013 or whoever was prime minister then \u2013 would be forced by the law to obtain a Brexit extension.\n\nEqually, however, it will be difficult for Corbyn to persuade his MPs to back him. Many of them are adamant that they will not vote for an election date that is before 31 October. They can\u2019t say so, but some of them must fear that Johnson will win the election and drag the country out of the EU without a deal.\n\nAnd if Corbyn cannot persuade 100 of his 247 MPs, then the early election motion will again fall short of the two-thirds majority needed.\n\nThat means Monday will be the next flashpoint in the three-year rolling crisis that is Brexit. If the Benn bill passes the House of Lords, possibly sitting all weekend, Corbyn and his Labour MPs will have to decide what happens next.\n\nTonight, Corbyn seemed set on voting for an election on 15 October. He does not want to appear to be ducking the challenge, and he wants to avoid being portrayed as leader of the \u201cblock Brexit\u201d party. But he is \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 up against a large majority of Labour MPs who want to deny Johnson the chance of victory and trap him into asking for a Brexit extension.\n\nThe drama is not over yet.", "description": "The most significant words tonight were uttered by Jeremy Corbyn, who was late to take his place in the chamber after MPs passed the bill to block a no-deal Brexit surprisingly quickly.\u00a0 The Labour leader repeated what he had said the night before: \u201cLet this bill pass and gain royal assent, then we will back an election so we do not crash out with a no-deal exit from the EU.\u201d", "authors": ["John Rentoul"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/19/Jeremy-Corby-parliament-1.jpg"}
