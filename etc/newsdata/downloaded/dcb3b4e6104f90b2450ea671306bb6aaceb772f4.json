Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) after last Tuesday's Democratic debate. She's already joined him on the campaign trail, giving him a raucous introduction at a rally in Queens, New York over the weekend. In her speech, she praised Sanders for leading a new \"working class revolution\" and promoting policies such as Medicare for All.\n\nSure, he's progressive and all. But are the optics really worth it? CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion, who is black, asked AOC at Sanders's rally why she's supporting an \"old, white guy\" as the future of the Democratic Party. That old, white guy was sitting right next to her.\n\nSerious question asked to AOC:\n\n\u201cAs a woman of color, why back an old white guy? And is this the future of the party?\u201d\n\n\n\nSurprisingly she had a half decent answer, but that isn\u2019t her actual view on the matter. pic.twitter.com/B1OdgMEJOT \u2014 ALX ???? ??

Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and former HUD Secretary Julian Castro. Killion wondered why AOC is not supporting these other, more diverse campaigns. Ocasio-Cortez said that yes, she did meet with other candidates before deciding on Sanders.\n\nAs for Sanders's age, that became a bigger issue a few weeks ago when the senator suffered a heart attack and had to undergo surgery. At this weekend's rally, he promised supporters he was back and \"more than ready\" to finish the campaign.\n\nAnother frontrunner, former Vice President Joe Biden, doesn't have age on his side either. He'll be 78 at the time of the 2020 inauguration. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who currently holds the lead, is 70 years old.", "description": ".10/22/2019 16:34:35PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/5db953eb-bbfc-4890-82f5-31fa75d46fcd.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
