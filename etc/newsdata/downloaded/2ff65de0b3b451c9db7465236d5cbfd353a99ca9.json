His body has never been found.\n\nSubway singer\n\nA Los Angeles police officer was captivated by the soprano voice of a 52-year-old homeless woman in a subway station. After the video of her singing went viral, she was identified by my local media as Emily Zamourka, who came to the United States from Russia at the age of 24. She said she was homeless due to illness and used to play a violin until it was stolen three years ago.\n\nRed faces\n\nClimate change activists used a fire engine to spray red paint at the facade of Britain's finance ministry on Thursday (October 3) in an attempt to draw attention to what they said was the government's failure to avert a climate emergency. However, they briefly lost control of the hose.\n\nAzores battered by Lorenzo\n\nAzores residents are counting the cost of damage caused by Hurricane Lorenzo.
