Colombia officials said the video was recorded in Venezuela. (Reuters Tv/Via Reuters)\n\nThe highly classified map shows a Colombian guerrilla camp on the southern bank of a hydroelectric plant in the picturesque foothills of the Venezuelan Andes. Allegedly led by a leftist fighter known as \u201cCommander Lenin,\u201d it\u2019s one of several heavily armed outposts of combatants said to be fighting against the Colombian government while engaging in extortion, kidnapping, assassinations and drug trafficking from bases in Venezuela.\n\nAnd according to Venezuela\u2019s former intelligence chief, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro knows all about it.\n\nThose details and others \u2014 including the rough locations and activities of Colombian drug cartels and criminal gangs operating on Venezuelan soil \u2014 are part of a Venezuelan intelligence report that Gen. Manuel Ricardo Cristopher Figuera says he hand-delivered to Maduro at his Caracas residence last November.\n\n\u201cI gave him a folder with this and told him, \u2018Look, this is the situation with the guerrillas,\u2019 \u201d said the former intelligence chief, who turned against Maduro this year and is now in the United States.\n\n\u201cThey never took action,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could say that Maduro is a friend of the guerrillas.\u201d\n\nMaduro, the head of Venezuela\u2019s socialist government, has long voiced ideological sympathy for Colombia\u2019s leftist guerrillas. But he has denied claims by Colombian officials and others that his government has cooperated with them. Maduro\u2019s communications ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nVenezuelan Interior Minister Nestor Reverol alleges a connection between Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 and members of the Colombian narco-paramilitary organization Los Rastrojos. (Federico Parra/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe classified report \u2014 a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post \u2014 offers new allegations about the scope of Maduro\u2019s personal knowledge of the guerrillas\u2019 presence and activities at a time when tensions in the region are rapidly escalating.\n\n[Maduro\u2019s ex-spy chief lands in U.S. armed with allegations against Venezuelan government]\n\nColombian officials are planning to make a highly charged presentation against Maduro\u2019s government Wednesday at the U.N. General Assembly, alleging that it is evolving from a domestic threat to an international threat by harboring guerrillas they describe as \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nTheir evidence is to include photographs of Colombian guerrillas they say were taken on Venezuelan territory, and summaries of internal Venezuelan documents, some of them revealed by Colombia\u2019s Semana magazine this month, that indicate Maduro\u2019s government is actively providing them with military and logistical support.\n\nLate last month, some former leaders of the FARC, the Colombian guerrilla group that waged a decades-long war against the Colombian government, announced they were withdrawing from a 2016 peace agreement, returning to the jungle and taking up arms again. Colombian officials claimed that their video announcement was recorded in Venezuela.\n\nBefore the announcement, Maduro appeared to publicly embrace the breakaway group\u2019s commanders, saying in July that they were \u201cleaders of peace\u201d who were \u201cwelcome in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe Maduro government has countercharged that opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 is working with right-wing Colombian criminal gangs. Maduro\u2019s interior minister, Nestor Reverol, appeared on state television this month to show photos of Guaid\u00f3 in the company of two suspected members of the Colombian narco-paramilitary organization Los Rastrojos, also mentioned as operating in Venezuela in the intelligence report obtained by The Post.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 has not denied the authenticity of the photos. He has said they were taken during his brief trip to Colombia in February, and he did not know who the men were.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask for criminal records to take a picture,\u201d he told reporters in Caracas.\n\n[As Colombia peace accord unravels, ex-FARC leaders take up arms, announce return to conflict]\n\nAccording to the report obtained by The Post, at least 600 members of the FARC, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, and the ELN, or National Liberation Army, had gathered in secret bases in the Venezuelan state of Amazonas.\n\nThe report indicates a far larger presence involved in illegal mining and other illicit operations in a broad swath of Venezuela stretching from the Caribbean coast to the southern border with Brazil. It includes photos with names and aliases of alleged guerrillas as well as Colombian narco-traffickers and criminal gang members operating in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d said Francisco Santos, Colombia\u2019s ambassador to the United States. \u201cIf anything, [the report] underestimates the current extent of the ELN. They have grown in the past year, and have felt more comfortable, because the government of Venezuela has created the conditions where they both are working to help each other in the border region.\u201d\n\nThe mounting allegations against Maduro\u2019s government come as the United States leads an international effort to oust the Venezuela leader with some of the harshest economic sanctions ever imposed by Washington. Nearly a dozen Western Hemisphere nations agreed this month to invoke the Rio Treaty, the 1947 pact that allows such joint actions as economic sanctions, naval blockades and military force.\n\nTalks organized by the Norwegian government to secure a deal between Maduro\u2019s government and the Guaid\u00f3-led opposition have broken down. Maduro\u2019s officials now are negotiating with smaller opposition groups. In response, Guaid\u00f3\u2019s officials have been pressuring European governments in particular to take a harder line against Maduro, to isolate a leader who claimed victory last year in a vote widely seen as fraudulent.\n\n[Inside the secret plot to turn senior Venezuelan officials against Maduro]\n\nAllegations of Venezuelan support for Colombian guerrillas dates back two decades to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the founder of Venezuela\u2019s socialist state. But opposition leaders say support for such groups, and their operations on Venezuelan territory, has ramped up under Maduro.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now very clear that the Colombian guerrillas are involved in illegal activities in Venezuela, and that [the Maduro government] is complicit in this,\u201d opposition leader Leopoldo L\u00f3pez said by telephone from the Spanish Embassy in Caracas, where he has sought sanctuary since an April 30 uprising attempt failed. \u201cThis contributes to opening the eyes of the international community that action needs to be taken.\u201d\n\nFiguera said he commissioned the report obtained by The Post late last year after a deadly ELN attack on a Venezuelan military outpost. That attack came after Venezuelan military commanders had taken the rare action of arresting four Colombian guerrillas on Venezuelan territory. They included an ELN commander: Felipe Ortega Bernal, also known as \u201cLa Garganta\u201d \u2014 the Throat.\n\nAfter Figuera handed Maduro the document, Figuera said, Maduro directed him to pass the material on to other senior officials, including Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez.\n\nPadrino L\u00f3pez, Figuera said, appeared to share his concern that Colombian guerrillas were operating with impunity on Venezuelan territory.\n\n\u201cBut he told me he wasn\u2019t authorized to take action,\u201d Figuera said.\n\nA month later, Figuera said, a senior Colombian guerrilla leader asked him for a one-on-one meeting. He said he approached Maduro again.\n\n\u201cMaduro just told me, \u2018I will handle it,\u2019 \u201d Figuera said. \u201cThat was it. End of matter.\u201d\n\nBoth the Venezuelan government and the ELN have denied coordinated logistical or tactical support. In May, the ELN, now Colombia\u2019s largest active guerrilla group, denied it maintained troops in Venezuela and denied any allegiance to Maduro.\n\n\u201cThese accusations are false,\u201d Israel Ram\u00edrez, a senior ELN commander known by the nom de guerre Pablo Beltran, said in a recorded messaged distributed to the media. \u201cThere are records of the dozens of members of the ELN who have been arrested on the Venezuelan border and immediately deported to Colombia.\u201d\n\nJorge Rodr\u00edguez, Maduro\u2019s minister of communication, has denied the Semana magazine report. He said the documents on which it was based were forged and part of a right-wing conspiracy aimed at taking down Maduro.\n\n\u201cThey kill the truth in order to prepare the ground for an armed aggression against Venezuela,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\nCarol Morello and Mariana Zu\u00f1iga contributed to this report.\n\nRead more\n\nIn Venezuela\u2019s oil capital, life is a struggle.
