National Curry week.\n\nAnd to help you celebrate, we took on the mighty job of ranking supermarket's own-brand Indian ready meals in a blind taste test to find out which you can eat instead of the usual expensive takeaway, and which ones aren't even worth waiting three minutes at the microwave for.\n\nIn a recent study on Brit's top ten favourite curries, Uber Eats found that chicken tikka masala takes the top spot, followed by a classic korma and jerk chicken curry, so for our taste test, we decided to compare the good old chicken tikka.\n\nMicrowaveable chicken tikka ready meals were tested from eight supermarkets in total, including M&S, Waitrose, Aldi, Co-op, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Iceland and Asda - and there was one very surprising winner.\n\nIceland took top spot for their \u00a32.69 classic chicken tikka masala, which scored five out of five for its perfect levels of spice and a decent coating of sauce, despite being the second cheapest option in the mix - and the same price as Aldi.\n\nIn second place was none other than Marks and Spencer, with 4.5 out of 5 - perfect timing, considering they've just launched their brand new 'Best Ever Tikka Masala', which we can confirm is indeed, one of the best.\n\nBut whilst M&S' offering costs \u00a35 per dish (or you can get it alongside another curry, plus two sides for \u00a310 in the meal deal), Iceland's costs half that, at just \u00a32.69.\n\nWe've got the full list of ratings below, so you can see if your favourite matches up to our curry critics'.\n\nBeautifully flavoured creamy sauce with the perfect level of spice, paired with tender chicken.\n\nThe marinade makes this, with its succulent flame-grilled chicken taking centre stage with a restaurant-style sauce to go with.\n\nNicely balanced sauce thats strong but not punchy - which is good as you get a lot of it! However the packaging needs some work, as two out of three of the samples leaking in transit.\n\nCreamy but not too tomatoey, could do with a touch of extra spice though.\n\nBig fans of the box, as it looks just like a takeaway container so you can keep it for storing your future food in. No major spice notes but a lot of tomato.\n\nCo-op Chicken Tikka Masala and Pilau rice, \u00a32.75, 2.5/5\n\nYou get a lot of sauce with this, and there's not much spice in there. Best after a night out if you're already struggling with the acid reflux.\n\nAldi Speciality Selected Irresistibly Creamy Chicken Tikka Masala, \u00a32.69: 2/5\n\nBig chicken pieces but pretty tasteless sadly.\n\nOverly sweet sauce and does not fit with the dish. The three different flavours of chicken together doesn't work very well either. Very good level of spice though.", "description": "It's National Curry week, so to celebrate, we've rated all the supermarket's chicken tikka ready meals, from Aldi to M&S", "authors": ["Molly Holt"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20540000.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-08-at-183148.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
