It Can Arrest Giuliani.", "language": "en", "text": "In his letter to House leadership, the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, drew a line in the sand: The administration will not \u201cparticipate in\u201d the impeachment proceedings in any way. The odd language of \u201cparticipate in\u201d \u2014 presidential impeachment is not meant to be a collaboration between Congress and the president \u2014 obscures the central thrust of the letter: The White House is refusing to respond to any subpoenas or other demands for information from the House.\n\nOf course, other administrations have fought with Congress over access to information, but those fights have centered around clearly articulated objections, supported by legal reasoning, to turning over specific documents or allowing specific officials to testify. The Trump administration\u2019s wholesale refusal to treat congressional information demands as legitimate is so different in degree as to become different in kind.\n\nIt might seem like the White House has the House of Representatives over a barrel. If the president simply refuses to engage, what can the House do? How does a chamber of Congress go about wringing information from an unwilling executive branch?\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing out of the way at the outset: The answer is unlikely to be found in a courtroom. That\u2019s not to say that the House probably wouldn\u2019t win on the merits. Most of the administration\u2019s arguments are risible, and even many Republican judges will have trouble swallowing them. Indeed, when the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations raised significantly more plausible objections to congressional subpoenas, the courts sided with the House, ordering the executive to turn over the vast majority of the subpoenaed material.", "description": "Two ways that Democrats in the House can match the White House\u2019s aggressive tactics.", "authors": ["Josh Chafetz"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/opinion/10chafetz/merlin_161561043_a59f56f3-8cdf-4544-8706-0b2aff6abe24-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
