That way she can ensure that what she hopes she thinks no doubt will take place. But the reality is that I don\u2019t agree, the Supreme Court found no impropriety on behalf of the government, the prime minister or anybody else.\"\n\nThat seems to imply that Johnson will have another go at getting an early election -- but even if he just needs a simple majority, it's not clear he can achieve that.\n\nWhat's more, such a bill would be amendable -- meaning the opposition could add any number of additions seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit, or change the date of the vote that the government puts forward.\n\nAnd if Johnson wants to avoid a poll after having to extend Brexit, he's already too late -- there must be at least 25 working days between an election being called and being held, which means that if one were approved tomorrow it would be held on October 30 at the earliest.\n\nThat's a day before the Brexit deadline, but more than a week after the EU summit at which Johnson would have to ask for an extension.", "description": "British lawmakers return to the House of Commons, after the Supreme Court ruled Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of Parliament was unlawful.", "authors": ["Analysis Luke Mcgee"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190925113831-boris-johnson-un-speech-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
