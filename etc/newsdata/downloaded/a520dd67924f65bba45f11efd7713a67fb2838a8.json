Through Bluetooth, I can use my hearing aids to talk on the phone. In addition to these, I own Hearphones, manufactured by Bose. When I ride the subway in New York, I use the noise-canceling feature in the Hearphones to silence the world around me. At the same moment, I can stream music from my iPhone into my head.\n\nThere I am, sitting on the 1 train downtown, hearing no sound except the soft music of one of Chopin\u2019s nocturnes for piano.\n\nThe Hearphones are also very helpful at a party or a restaurant, where an app on my phone enables me to silence the conversations of people behind me, and amplify just the voice of the person I\u2019m with.\n\nThere are more than a few reservations about the new over-the-counter hearing aids, though. Some of these come from audiologists, whose business will surely be affected by the act. Taking audiologists out of the process raises the possibility that people won\u2019t get the device appropriate to their needs. In the long run, a hearing aid that doesn\u2019t work or fit can be worse than nothing. And medical conditions that require intervention might well be missed without a professional exam.\n\nBut in general, over-the-counter devices will make good hearing available to millions of people. The average cost of hearing aids in this country is $4,600 a pair. The nonprescription devices won\u2019t be free, but they\u2019ll be cheaper \u2014 some for sale right now cost $300 to $350. My Hearphones cost $500.\n\nThe real problem is that in many cases, hearing devices are not covered by insurance. And even at $300, they will be expensive enough to keep many people from getting help. I\u2019ll allow someone to my right to explain why the ability to hear shouldn\u2019t be covered by all Americans\u2019 insurance.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Medicare cover hearing aids? Why do so many private insurers fail to do so? I understand the need to keep overall costs down, but something\u2019s wrong when something as basic as hearing the world is considered one of those luxuries conservatives mock as \u201cfree stuff.\u201d", "description": "First, let people buy some types of devices over the counter.", "authors": ["Jennifer Finney Boylan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/opinion/01Boylan/01Boylan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
