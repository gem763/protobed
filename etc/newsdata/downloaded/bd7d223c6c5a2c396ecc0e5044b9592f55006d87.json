REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nThe US is not only re-evaluating its approach to missile defense, as the Pentagon's Missile Defense Review explains, but the US military is also striving to develop hypersonic systems of its own.\n\nThe US appears to be trying to catch up rather than lead the way on this new technology.\n\n\"In the last year, China has tested more hypersonics weapons than we have in a decade,\" Michael Griffin, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering, said at the end of 2018. \"We've got to fix that.\"\n\nArmy Lt. Gen. Neil Thurgood, the director of the Army's new Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) charged with the development of a hypersonic glide vehicle for ground-launched hypersonic weapons, said in May that his office is in a \"full-out sprint\" to develop this technology.\n\nThurgood's announcement followed a decision in March by the secretary and chief of staff of the Army to accelerate the delivery of a prototype ground-launched hypersonic weapon.\n\n\"With near-peer competitors developing their own hypersonic capabilities, the Army plans to counter them with about $1.2 billion on experimental prototyping through fiscal 2024,\" the Army said two months later.\n\nTwo related contracts were awarded to Dynetics and Lockheed Martin for $351.6 million and $347 million, respectively, in August.\n\nBut while the US is working hard to develop hypersonic weapons, the earliest expected delivery date is fiscal year 2023, likely well behind some of America's near-peer adversaries.", "description": "A hypersonic missile releases an aerodynamic warhead that can maneuver along unusual and unpredictable flight paths at high speeds to skirt defenses.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d93b22f2e22af45101cc1fe?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
