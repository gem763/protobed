(So have Twitter and YouTube.)\n\nElizabeth Warren posted an advertisement saying falsely that Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Donald Trump. In the post, she quickly acknowledges that's not actually true, but says that by allowing falsehoods, Zuckerberg has \"given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform \u2014 and then to pay Facebook gobs of money.\"\n\nFacebook responded on Twitter Saturday that broadcast stations across the country aired this ad nearly 1,000 times, as required by law. \"FCC doesn't want broadcast companies censoring candidates' speech,\" Facebook said. \"We agree it's better to let voters \u2014 not companies \u2014 decide.\"\n\nYes, but: The broadcast networks operate under unique rules because they are using public airwaves. Businesses operating in nearly every other type of media can (and often do) set their own rules, including cable, internet and outdoor media.\n\nHistory lesson: Every company or person who has ever been in charge of a platform, a message board, or a comments area knows that trolls are going to take any rule about acceptable content and stress-test it from a zillion directions.\n\nThe problem here is what to do when those pushing the boundaries aren't everyday trolls, but rather the president of the United States and one of his leading challengers.\n\nFacebook, for its part, has invested a lot in creating a more systematic approach to evaluating content, clarifying its community standards, bringing in third-party fact checkers, and setting up an independent \"Supreme Court\" appeals board to provide a final say. (Facebook says it's focusing the fact checkers' limited time on memes and hoaxes, not politicians' words.)\n\nFacebook argues it should take a nearly completely hands-off approach to what politicians say in their paid advertisements, and it's not alone \u2014 many critics, as well, don't want to see the social network set the boundaries of political speech. (See below for just what the social network is and isn't allowing.)\n\nMy thought bubble: As political ads inevitably keep testing Facebook's boundaries, the company's best solution may be to stop taking them altogether (as some transit agencies have, for example) \u2014 trading a modest revenue loss for the opportunity not to be blamed for swinging a second election in a row.\n\nGo deeper: Zuckerberg talks Warren's \"existential\" breakup threat in leaked audio", "description": "As political ads inevitably keep testing Facebook's boundaries, the company's best solution may be to stop taking them altogether.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/kcuCM8Xo4pe_567lk8WD9A1-bgg=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/14/1571060528391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
