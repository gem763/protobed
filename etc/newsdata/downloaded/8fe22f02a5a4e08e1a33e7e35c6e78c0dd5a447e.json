But plant-based meals?\n\nThat could be set to change with the pub brand\u2019s newest addition to the menu.\n\nJD Wetherspoon has teamed up with startup The Meatless Farm \u2013 the UK rival to those Impossible and Beyond Meat burgers you\u2019ve heard about \u2013 to create a vegan burger with the taste and texture of meat.\n\nThe burgers first landed on the menu early this year. Now, after a successful six-month trial in 40 Wetherspoon\u2019s pubs, it\u2019ll be available at all 880 Wetherspoon\u2019s branches.\n\nYou may have sampled The Meatless Farm\u2019s offering before \u2013 they sell their plant-based mince, burgers, and sausages in loads of major supermarkets.\n\nMade of pea, soy and rice protein, chicory root, and carrot fibre, the burger is designed to have that meaty feel that will convert even the staunchest carnivores to give it a go.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Wetherspoons already does a vegetarian burger, this will be the first ever vegan patty the pub has sold.\n\nIt\u2019s served with a side of chips and onion rings for around \u00a36 (prices vary depending on which Wetherspoon you head to).\n\nWetherspoon\u2019s head of catering, Jameson Robinson, said: \u2018We are keen to offer vegetarian and vegan pub-goers an excellent choice of meals to enjoy at Wetherspoon.\n\n\u2018The plant-based burger is a great addition to the menu and we are confident that it will prove popular with vegetarians and vegans as well as those who eat meat.\u2019\n\nMORE: Zizzi launches jackfruit pepperoni pizza and it\u2019s completely vegan\n\nMORE: BrewDog launches a 50% beef, 50% vegan burger and it\u2019s got people talking\n\nMORE: 2020 wedding trends: Fairytale wedding dresses and vegan menus are set to be big next year\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Wetherspoon has teamed up with The Meatless Farm to create a convincing fake meat burger that's entirely plant-based.", "authors": ["Ellen Scott"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88953894_1570599749.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
