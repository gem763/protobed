(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen she arrived in Washington at the start of the Mystics\u2019 new era, Emma Meesseman had only two weeks\u2019 worth of clothes.\n\nIt was the spring of 2013, and the 19-year-old from Belgium showed up at Mystics training camp with no expectations of making the team. Success in the WNBA wasn\u2019t a lifelong dream; the American league was more on the periphery for a player who hoped to make it big in Europe. Meesseman was looking forward to training camp in large part because it was an excuse to skip her final exams at university.\n\nThe team\u2019s newly hired coach and general manager, Mike Thibault, had slightly higher expectations. Although it wasn\u2019t the norm to look to Europe for players at the time, Thibault had been tracking Meesseman since she was named FIBA Europe young player of the year in 2011. He liked her skills and received good enough reports about her work ethic and personality that he drafted her 19th overall.\n\nMeesseman, now a staple in Washington, ended the 2019 regular season as the Mystics\u2019 second-leading scorer, averaging 13.1 points while shooting 55.2 percent from the field and 42.2 percent from three-point range.\n\n\u201cWe might have screwed up,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cWe had two second-round picks, and we took her with the second one \u2014 we probably should\u2019ve taken her with the first. We knew she would be good, but we had no idea how good. That was a little luck. But this all started with that draft.\u201d\n\nMany observers mark the beginning of this WNBA era in Washington with the 2017 acquisitions of Elena Delle Donne and Kristi Toliver. But peek under the Mystics\u2019 hood, and it\u2019s far more complex than that \u2014 this team, which is seeded No. 1 in the playoffs and begins a best-of-five semifinal series against No. 4 Las Vegas on Tuesday, is the culmination of a process that began in 2013. It\u2019s the product of Thibault\u2019s long-term vision, an organizational emphasis on character as much as talent and, as was the case with Meesseman, a little luck.\n\nThe Mystics begin the playoffs as the most dominant team: They enter Tuesday\u2019s game at Entertainment and Sports Arena riding a 10-game home winning streak after posting a league-record 13 wins by 20 or more points this season and averaging a league-leading 89.3 points.\n\nThey did so with a roster that\u2019s something of an anomaly compared with other teams that have been dominant in the WNBA \u2014 not just this year, but this decade.\n\nOnly three of this year\u2019s major contributors were drafted by Washington, and all three were either a surprise or a lower-round pick that turned out as well as it possibly could have: Meesseman was taken at No. 19 in 2013, starting point guard Natasha Cloud went No. 15 in 2015 and starting shooting guard Ariel Atkins unexpectedly went No. 7 in 2018. Every other core player arrived in other ways.\n\nIn contrast, every title-winning team this decade aside from the 2010 Seattle Storm and the 2012 Indiana Fever has featured at least two players who were drafted No. 1 overall by the team with which they won the championship. Those teams\u2019 cores have largely been homegrown.\n\nThibault, 68, who got his start in basketball as a scout and learned how to evaluate personalities, not just players, has employed a different method.\n\n\n\nMike Thibault has been executing a long-term vision for years. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201c[Thibault] is able to seek out talent and fit pieces together in the right ways,\u201d ESPN analyst LaChina Robinson said. \u201cI usually call Mike before the draft, because there\u2019s not going to be a player that\u2019s on the board, or not on the board, that he hasn\u2019t seen or scouted. \u2026 Mike Thibault was the first one to say to me, \u2018Emma Meesseman is going to be a star.\u2019 Or LaToya Sanders, she\u2019s not someone who was going to jump out at you, necessarily, as any team\u2019s starting center. And there\u2019s a long-term plan for players like Ariel Atkins, who went seventh and wasn\u2019t even at the draft and is arguably \u2014 to me, they don\u2019t make the Finals last year without her.\n\n\u201cAgain, it\u2019s Mike Thibault doing his work in the offseason, seeing what players can do but also forecasting what they can be.\u201d\n\nSince 2013, Thibault\u2019s vision for the team has been to play up-tempo with players who are multidimensional. He has taken players such as Cloud, a ballhandling guard who was also the Atlantic 10 defensive player of the year as a junior, and Maryland product Tianna Hawkins, who can play with her back to the basket but is also a shooter. She arrived via trade in 2014.\n\nThose he drafted for their fundamental skills, he developed. He coaxed Meesseman into shooting threes; after she attempted only four in her first two years in the league, she went 19 for 45 from deep this season.\n\nJust as paramount to skill set is character. When Thibault was with the Connecticut Sun and keen on drafting Tina Charles out of the University of Connecticut, he made a point to attend a Huskies game against Holy Cross. He knew the game would be a 40-point blowout but wanted to watch Charles on the bench in the second half.\n\n\u201cDid she cheer for her teammates? Did she coach her backup, stay involved mentally?\u201d Thibault recalled seeking.\n\nWhen he finds a player with the right skills who\u2019s also a good teammate, Thibault has shown he is willing to wait. Sanders, the starting center, didn\u2019t play in the league for three seasons from 2012 to 2014 while she dealt with the death of her father and tended to overseas obligations.\n\nThibault liked her defense and knew from former Mystics player Ivory Latta, who played with Sanders at North Carolina, that her personality was the right fit. Thibault convinced Sanders to come back in 2015.\n\nSeeking out such players has made a difference: All season, the Mystics have attributed their league-crushing offense to chemistry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a person who \u2014 Belgium is my only home, forever,\u201d Meesseman said. \u201cBut this year is like the first year where I\u2019m really comfortable. We all genuinely care for each other, and that matters.\u201d\n\nSaid Robinson: \u201cThat\u2019s been the key to their success \u2014 they are so unbothered as a team. They\u2019re so together, it\u2019s very hard to shake them mentally in terms of their focus.\u201d\n\nWith players including Sanders, Meesseman and Hawkins in place laying a foundation, Thibault achieved the crowning moment in his long-term plan when he sent Chicago the Mystics\u2019 No. 2 pick in the 2017 draft along with Stefanie Dolson and Kahleah Copper for Delle Donne, who was demanding a trade from the Sky at the time and wished to be closer to home, then signed Toliver a few weeks later.\n\nAll that was left was to mold the team further around Delle Donne\u2019s and Toliver\u2019s vast talents. Thibault added a lethal young shooter in Atkins and picked up a dynamic shooter and defender in Aerial Powers. Cloud transformed her game and became a more reliable shooter and confident point guard. And Thibault did away with a traditional center: At 6-foot-2, shorter than Delle Donne and Meesseman, Sanders is the smallest center in the league.\n\n\u201cUp-tempo, pick and pop, we\u2019re a team that doesn\u2019t really have a true center that posts up, 6-6 and above,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that. I even asked him because after last year I was like, \u2018Coach T, you\u2019re going to get me a center, right?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThibault knew he didn\u2019t need one. This Mystics roster went 26-8 in the regular season and glided toward the No. 1 seed with little trouble. Now, they\u2019re on the verge of fulfilling the vision Thibault had when he plucked an underestimated player from Belgium in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interesting,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cWith the timing of everything and everyone, we all just balance each other out \u2026 and the things that we all have in common are unselfishness, willing to sacrifice and just being good teammates. But we also have really, really good basketball players. Mike was able to put together a good little misfit group, I guess.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFor Mystics\u2019 Kristi Toliver, being injured for the first time means learning to let go\n\nMystics\u2019 Elena Delle Donne and Mike Thibault take stock as honors start to roll in\n\nThe Wizards could learn a thing or two from the Mystics, the best team in the WNBA\n\nSpain teaches USA Basketball a lesson about the value of commitment\n\nAfter 15 years, 10 teams, three titles and one devastating knee injury, Shaun Livingston retires", "description": "Every title-winning team this decade aside from the 2010 Seattle Storm and the 2012 Indiana Fever has featured at least two players who were drafted No. 1 overall by the team with which they won the championship.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges", "Ava Wallace Covers College Sports With A Focus On Georgetown", "Navy", "Maryland", "As Well As Tennis", "The Wnba For The Washington Post.
