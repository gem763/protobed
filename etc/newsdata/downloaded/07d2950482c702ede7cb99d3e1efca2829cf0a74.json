The previous house had eight bedrooms and 10 bathrooms according to Mail Online, with construction set to finish next month.\n\nNot like the family is scraping their pennies together to make sure every part of the house is as luxe and perfect as possible, with Chris being the second-highest paid actor in Hollywood last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter starring in Avengers: Endgame, as well as Men In Black: International, the Thor actor landed in the runners up place in Forbes magazine\u2019s latest list of highest paid actors in Hollywood with a reported salary of $76.4million (\u00a363million) from movies alone.\n\nWhen it comes to his overall earnings in the celebrity 100, he shifts down the list a little to #24, but in Hollywood his paycheque is heftier than Endgame Thor\u2019s BMI.\n\nNot behd, eh?\n\nGot a showbiz story?
