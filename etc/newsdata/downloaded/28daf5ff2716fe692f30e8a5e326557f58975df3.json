A Mach 2 aircraft capable of air superiority and ground-strike missions, it is Russia\u2019s first stealth plane, and probably the most sophisticated aircraft in the Russian arsenal. It also has a long and troubled history stretching back more than a decade, due to technical issues and even more because of financial considerations. Estimates have ranged from $40 million to $156 million per plane\u2014a figure that earlier made the Russian Air Force cancel mass production and buy just a handful of aircraft. Russia now has about a dozen Su-57s, which have flown a few missions over Syria.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The Navy has its hands full.", "authors": ["Michael Peck"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jGMOOnLwCoFzKPvH4NRcOw--~B/aD05NjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/080fe22069c3860030f684ac02bb34f4", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
