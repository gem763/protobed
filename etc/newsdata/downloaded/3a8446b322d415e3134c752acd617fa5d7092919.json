and the Thai king's assertive reign", "language": "en", "text": "Known as Koi, Sineenat is a qualified pilot and was the first woman to receive the consort title in nearly a century (AFP Photo/Handout)\n\nThe very public downfall of the Thai king's 34-year-old consort -- stripped of all royal titles and military ranks by a late-night command -- left the country open-mouthed Tuesday at the latest abrupt act from its mercurial monarch.\n\nFormer royal bodyguard and army nurse Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi was dismissed from the rank of Chao Khun Phra, or noble consort, and accused of \"disloyalty to the king\".\n\nHer whereabouts are unknown but the announcement has set social media alight with speculation and intrigue sparked by the rare glimpse behind cloistered palace walls.\n\nBut it wasn't the first time King Maha Vajiralongkorn has made his powerful presence felt since ascending the throne in 2016.\n\nHere are five ways royal power has been displayed under Thailand's new king so far, from beefing up his security to taking direct control of a fortune.\n\n- 'Disloyalty' in palace -\n\nThe palace said Sineenat had not obeyed the king, had created conflict in the palace by going above her authority, and had acted \"against the appointment of the Queen (Suthida)... for her own ambitions\".\n\nHer actions had also undermined the monarchy, it said.\n\nKnown as Koi, Sineenat is a qualified pilot and was the first woman to receive the consort title in nearly a century.\n\nAfter she obtained it, the palace released images of a short-haired Sineenat in combat fatigues shooting weapons, flying a jet and preparing to parachute from a plane, as well as holding the king's hand.\n\nIt was a vivid contrast to the swift dismissal, which has gripped Thai Twitter users.\n\n#SaveKoi was one of the trending hashtags, while one user said they felt \"sorry\" for Sineenat.\n\nThailand has a harsh royal defamation law that means media must self-censor when reporting on the palace.\n\nSineenat's rapid fall from favour is not the only time the Thai public has been given a glimpse into the king's dramatic personal life.\n\nSeveral relatives of his third wife Srirasmi were arrested as part of a police corruption probe and charged with lese majeste.\n\nVajiralongkorn divorced her and she lost her royal titles, and pictures later circulated of her with a shaven head.\n\n- Army units -\n\nThe palace has also stepped up royal security under Vajiralongkorn, adding 1,600 police officers.\n\nTwo new army units were later put under the monarch's direct control in October by royal decree, only a few months after the May coronation.\n\nIt is unclear how many soldiers are in each regiment, but experts say a single division holds up to 5,000 troops.\n\nThe troop transfer saw pushback from the youth-propelled Future Forward Party in parliament who questioned the \"urgency\" of such a move -- an unprecedented political objection to a royal command.\n\nBut the decree still passed with an overwhelming majority.\n\n- Banking billions -\n\nKing Vajiralongkorn inherited one of the world's richest monarchies from his beloved father Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in October 2016.\n\nAmong his successor's earliest moves was to assert full, personal control over the Crown Property Bureau (CPB), which has billions in assets in banks, companies and prime real estate.\n\nThe CPB committee was previously headed by the finance minister in an arrangement that gave a sheen of public oversight of a trust some experts estimate to be worth $30-$60 billion.\n\nThe CPB's full assets are privately held and remain a closely guarded secret.\n\n- Haircuts and salutes -\n\nDiscipline, protocol and loyalty are virtues state officials say the king insists upon, especially among royal guards.\n\nVajiralongkorn reminded members of his beefed-up detail in April that their duty was to \"preserve the nation, country, and monarchy\".\n\nThe army introduced a new salute under Vajiralongkorn in which soldiers must puff out their chests and jerk their heads to the side.\n\nAnd the country's police force has adopted a uniform crew-cut said to be at the king's request.\n\n- Charter changes -\n\nAny major legal changes in Thailand require the king's signature.\n\nBut King Vajiralongkorn ordered rewrites to part of the country's new constitution, including a vaguely worded clause that says any unforeseen issues should be handled based on \"tradition\".\n\nThey also scrap the need for the king, who spends much of his time in Germany, to appoint a regent when abroad.\n\nWhile Thailand's constitutional monarchy is nominally above politics, Vajiralongkorn has taken actions that many see as smudging the line.\n\nBefore the March 24 election he torpedoed a bid by his older sister to become prime minister at the head of an anti-junta party, calling it \"highly inappropriate\".", "description": "The very public downfall of
