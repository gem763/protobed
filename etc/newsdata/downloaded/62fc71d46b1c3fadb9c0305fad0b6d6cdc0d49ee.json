Why aren\u2019t the presidential candidates talking about it?", "language": "en", "text": "An extra $24 a month. That\u2019s how much the average Social Security recipient will get in 2020. That\u2019s according to the Social Security Administration, which said Thursday that the cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) is being bumped up 1.6%.\n\nRead: Social Security Administration announces lower COLA than in past two years\n\nThat pushes the monthly take for the average retiree past the $1,500 mark for the first time, to $1,503, or $18,036 a year. Some 63 million Americans get Social Security and 8 million get Supplementary Security Income (SSI benefits). Some get both. It is also the nation\u2019s largest children\u2019s program, too.\n\nThat so many Americans are touched by this gargantuan program makes me wonder this: With the presidential campaign in full swing, how come entitlement spending\u2014about 60% of the entire federal budget\u2014isn\u2019t getting much discussion? It should. Such spending is exploding, fueled by 10,000 baby boomer retirements a day and by seniors who are living longer, often far longer.\n\nIn this column, I\u2019ll focus on Social Security and what the leading candidates are saying (I\u2019ll discuss Medicare in a future column).\n\nFirst this essential info: The two trust funds that pay Social Security\u2019s benefits\u2014the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) and the Disability Insurance (DI) trust funds\u2014are running out of money. Come 2035, payouts, which are tied to tax revenues, will have to be cut. The Social Security Administration\u2019s trustees warn future beneficiaries could get about 75% of scheduled benefits.\n\nNow, the top candidates:\n\nPresident Trump says publicly that he is committed to protecting Social Security. But privately, Trump has talked about reforming it in a second term, claims Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyoming).\n\nWhat does \u201creforming\u201d mean? What do you think it means? Cuts. Here, the president finds some powerful company in Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, who has made no secret of wanting to cut entitlements, which be blames\u2014not tax cuts\u2014for running up the deficit.\n\nWe\u2019ve already gotten a preview of this with Trump\u2019s own budget proposals, which have urged cuts to both Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. He has left other breadcrumbs. Years before running for president, he wrote that Social Security eligibility ages should be raised, and that the program itself could be privatized.\n\nAmong Democrats, former Vice President Joe Biden has spoken little of Social Security. But his long career in public service offers hints of what he would do in the White House. He has previously suggested means testing for benefits, raising the full retirement age (currently 66 years and 2 months for people born in 1955, rising to 67 for those born in 1960 or later) and/or increasing the cap on payroll tax earnings (which rises next year to $137,700). That each of these ideas involve inflicting pain on voters helps explain why Biden\u2019s not saying much about it.\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who, along with Biden, leads the still-crowded Democratic field, has also spoken of these ideas. But she also has a new and ambitious idea: to give every current and future Social Security recipient a huge boost: An extra $2,400 a year, which would cost, she estimates, $150 billion a year. How on earth would this be said for? Her answer: a new 14.8% tax on ultra high-income earners.\n\nThe problem with proposing a specific idea is that it opens you up to specific criticism, and in this case, it comes from John Cogan, a senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. Writing in The Wall Street Journal, he says such an idea should be limited only to those recipients who live below the federal poverty line\u2014in other words, means testing. There\u2019s no need, he says, to shower anyone else with cash.\n\nThere\u2019s little daylight between ideas floated by other leading Democrats, including senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Kamala Harris of California and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. All also generally favor shoring up Social Security in ways described above. Meantime, outsider Andrew Yang has proposed something entirely new: a \u201cUniversal Basic Income\u201d of $1,000 a month, to be paid for by taxing corporations. It\u2019s rather murky, because recipients might have to trade a portion of existing entitlement benefits to get it. Here\u2019s a mire detailed look I wrote about this a few weeks ago.\n\nNancy Altman of Social Security Works, an advocacy group, says if you\u2019re looking for stark differences on this vital program, don\u2019t look for them between Democrats, but between Democrats and President Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is a stark difference between the parties,\u201d she tells me, \u201cand even if you believe Trump\u2019s \u2018no cuts\u2019 claim, that\u2019s quite different than what Democrats want to do, which is expand Social Security.\u201d", "description": "What the candidates are saying \u2014 or not saying \u2014 about Social Security", "authors": ["Paul Brandus"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HM500_arends_ZG_20190630212226.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
