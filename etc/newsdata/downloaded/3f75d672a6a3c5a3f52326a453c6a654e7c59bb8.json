That continues a downward trend since the peak in 1980 of 29.3.\n\nElizabeth Nash, senior state issues manager at Guttmacher, said the overall drop is not attributable to a growing number of abortion restrictions.\n\n\"I don't think there's a clear pattern around why rates are falling,\" Nash said. \"They're going down across the country in nearly every state.\"\n\nNash said there are exceptions, notably Texas, where laws and regulations have led to clinic closures and abortion rates have declined as a result. In other states, such as Ohio, Nash said the data suggest restrictions and clinic closures have prompted women to go to neighboring states such as Michigan for the procedure.\n\nNash notes that the U.S. birthrate is also down, suggesting a decline in the number of women becoming pregnant. Also, the data come from 2017 \u2014 before a series of restrictive abortion bans were passed in state legislatures around the country. Those bans have yet to take effect, and many are tied up in legal challenges.\n\nNash also points to increased use of highly effective contraceptive methods such as IUDs in recent years as one possible cause.\n\nIn the past, groups opposed to abortion rights have suggested that the decline is due to changing attitudes about abortion. But public opinion polling suggests that U.S. opinions on abortion rights tend to be largely stable over time.\n\nThe report noted a 25% increase in the use of medication abortion, with nearly 4 in 10 abortions in 2017 being performed using abortion pills instead of surgery.\n\nThe analysis also includes data suggesting an increase in women using pills or other methods to self-induce abortions without a medical provider's assistance; 18% of non-hospital facilities surveyed said they'd treated at least one patient for an attempted self-induced abortion \u2014 up from 12% in the last survey, according to Guttmacher.", "description": "The rate fell again in the most recent Guttmacher Institute survey, continuing a decline since 1980.", "authors": ["Sarah Mccammon"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default-wide.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
