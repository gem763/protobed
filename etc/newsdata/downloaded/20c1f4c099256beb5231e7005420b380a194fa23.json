REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nWales\u2019 build-up to the World Cup has been far from plain sailing, with three defeats in their last four tests and the off-field furor that saw attack coach Rob Howley return home from Japan for an alleged breach of rugby\u2019s betting rules.\n\nBut Edwards says that despite this, and the predictions of wind and rain for the match, they are confident of an opening victory.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this for two years, we are totally focused on the game against a formidable opponent and one we have a lot of respect for. It will be physical, but we are here to compete,\u201d Edwards told reporters in Toyota on Sunday.\n\n\u201cPhysically they (Georgia) look in good shape and they are big men, but so are we and we have not come here to make up the numbers.\n\n\u201cThey have got a very inspirational captain (Mikheil Nariashvili) and he will be ready to lead his troops into battle.\u201d\n\nEdwards says much of the hard work is likely to be done by the pack and believes the early matches at the World Cup have illustrated the importance of set-piece dominance.\n\n\u201cSaturday\u2019s rugby proved how important the line-outs and scrums were. The Southern Hemisphere teams have been driving at the line-outs, which is not the way they have traditionally played.\n\n\u201cAustralia had a dominant scrum, Argentina did very well there as well, so it just shows that the basics of rugby are still there and a massive part of the game.\u201d\n\nIt could become especially important if the expected rain arrives, along with gusting winds, but Edwards points to the 25-7 win over Ireland in March at a wet Cardiff as proof of his team\u2019s proficiency to play in all weather.\n\n\u201cIf a storm comes, there is nothing we can about that. We handled the conditions very well against Ireland when they left the roof (of the Millennium Stadium) open in the last Grand Slam game.\n\n\u201cWe are confident of the way we can play in the wet and if it is slippery, which it potentially could be, we might have to adjust our tactics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously harder to play an expansive style, but you have to be a good athlete in all conditions, that\u2019s what is fantastic about the game of rugby.\u201d", "description": "Wales will weather the physical and meteorological storms predicted in their opening Rugby World Cup Pool D clash against Georgia at the City of Toyota Stadium on Monday, according to assistant coach Shaun Edwards.", "authors": ["Nick Said", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432574115&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L073-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
