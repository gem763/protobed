Tear later emailed all the parties involved to say the deal had not been finalized by email.\n\nBoth sides went to court, with the buyers arguing the inclusion of a name in the email counts as a legal signature.\n\n\"The purported signature of the solicitor on behalf of the defendant was by 'automatic' generation of his name, occupation, role and contact details at the foot of an email,\" wrote Judge Pearce, at Manchester Civil Justice Center.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nHe also noted that not all email from Tear included his automated signature. He said the use of \"many thanks\" in the email showed \"an intention to connect the name with the contents of the email.\"\n\nThe land was ordered to be sold for roughly $215,000 instead of the original $245,000 asking price.", "description": "A judge in the United Kingdom recently ruled an\u00a0automated email signature sent by a lawyer in a dispute over a land deal is legally binding, costing his client nearly $30,000.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/iStock-gavel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
