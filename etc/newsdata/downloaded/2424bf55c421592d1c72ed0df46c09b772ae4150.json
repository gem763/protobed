All negative words. It is embarrassing. It is a very bad result.\"\n\nThings started off well as Son Heung-min opened the scoring and even after Kimmich's quickfire leveller Spurs were the better side, but could not find that crucial second goal.\n\nLewandowski's effort on the stroke of half-time to put Bayern in front proved pivotal as they ran riot in the second half, scoring five times with a Harry Kane penalty wedged in between.\n\nThe defeat does nothing to alter the perception that all is not well at Spurs this season, but Vertonghen's central defensive partner Toby Alderweireld has called on his side to be \"men\" in their response to the hammering.\n\n\"It is up to us to try to change it as quickly as possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This is part of football, sometimes you are on the good side, sometimes you are on the bad side. We have to be men and take responsibility to try to change this as quickly as possible.\n\n\"We work hard and the only way up is to work hard and try to improve. Of course the fans are disappointed, we are as well.\n\n\"We have to try and get ourselves up as quickly as possible. Of course we did not say a lot, everyone was quiet.\n\n\"We have to manage it as a team, be together and work hard to pick ourselves up and try to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.\"\n\nIt was a dream return to north London for Gnabry, who failed to make the grade at Arsenal.\n\nHe broke his Champions League duck in style and enjoyed \"one of the best nights of his career\".\n\n\"I am very happy about tonight, myself getting four goals, my first Champions League goals,\" he said.\n\n\"It was a good night for me, but the most important thing was the win.\n\n\"Getting four goals is one of the best nights of my career. Getting such a big win is a good sign for us.\n\n\"We need to keep it down, we won 7-2 today, but we need to get through the group, there are still four games left but tonight is a confidence boost.\"", "description": "Tottenham Hotspur defender Jan Vertonghen says he and his team-mates let the club down after their 7-2 Champions League humiliation against Bayern Munich.
