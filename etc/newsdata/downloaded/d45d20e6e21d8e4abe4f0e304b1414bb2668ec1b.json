Ferrand, who had denied any wrongdoing, resigned as minister when that probe was ongoing.\n\nA lawmaker, he now heads up Macron\u2019s party in the lower house of parliament. The latest probe relates, like the last one, to Ferrand\u2019s management of a medical insurance company in Brittany.\n\nFerrand\u2019s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Government spokesman Sibeth Ndiaye declined to comment at a weekly news conference on Wednesday when asked about the latest investigation.", "description": "French National Assembly president Richard Ferrand, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron's, was questioned on Wednesday by investigating judges over allegations of improper acquisition of interest, a source close to the probe said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428689995&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A10Z", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
