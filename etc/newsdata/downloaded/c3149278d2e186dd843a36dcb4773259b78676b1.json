The Nasdaq Composite index advanced 9 points, or 0.1%, at 8,034. The S&P 500 index looks headed for a second week of small declines.\n\nThe Dow on Thursday gave up 79.59 points, or 0.3%, to end at 26,891.12, while the S&P 500 ost 7.25 points or 0.2%, to finish at 2,977.62. The Nasdaq closed at 8,030.66, down 46.72 points, or 0.6%.\n\nWhat's driving the market?\n\nCautious trade optimism returned to markets Friday after a report that a date for U.S.-China trade talks has been set. CNBC reported that top negotiators are set to meet Oct. 10-11 in Washington (link), with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He to lead the delegation from Beijing. Also, news reports said Chinese officials have talked about increased purchases of U.S. goods.\n\n\"With President Trump heavily focused on the impeachment proceedings and the unidentified whistleblower, markets are expecting this long process to possibly provide added incentive to see a trade deal get done before Thanksgiving,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note.\n\nThe weaker tone on Thursday, however, was tied in part to a news report that the Trump administration was unlikely to extend a waiver that allows U.S. companies to make sales to China telecom firm Huawei, potentially stoking trade tensions. Skeptics said they remained unconvinced after numerous swings between conciliation and escalation over the course of the U.S.-China trade battle stretching back to spring of last year.\n\n\"We have been here before,\" said Bas van Geffen, quantitative analyst at Rabobank.\n\nFundamental issues, including China's approach to intellectual property rights, remain unaddressed so far, van Geffen said in a note, adding that Trump may be reluctant to create the appearance he's growing soft on China ahead of the 2020 elections, a risk he runs if an intermediate deal doesn't sufficiently address fundamental U.S. concerns.\n\n\"We are not convinced that renewed trade talks will lead to the results the market may once again be hoping for, and any optimism ahead of the October meeting may be fleeting,\" he said.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday alleged that President Donald Trump attempted to coerce Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and that White House officials acted to conceal evidence of his actions. The controversy around the report prompted House Democrats this week to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe whistleblower report and impeachment concerns have had only a fleeting at most effect on markets so far, analysts said, but could become a factor (link) if the outlook for Trump's presidency darkens.\n\nInvestors were also parsing a bevy on new economic data Friday morning, after the Commerce Department estimated (link) that consumer spending rose 0.1% in August, versus expectations of a 0.3% rise, according to a MarketWatch poll of economists. Incomes, however, rose 0.4%, also below forecasts of 0.5%, indicating Americans saved much of their gains last month.\n\nCore personal-consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of price growth, advanced 0.1% month-over-month, while the annual rate rose from 1.7% to 1.8%, still below the Fed's 2% goal.\n\nOrders for durable goods rose by 0.2% in August (link), above the 0.7% decline expected by economists polled by MarketWatch, but excluding defense orders, they fell 0.6%. Core capital orders, an important measures of corporate capital investment, fell 0.2% in August, continuing a trend of weakness seen for much of the year.\n\nThe University of Michigan September consumer-sentiment index reading is due at 10 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAlso, Randal Quarles, the Federal Reserve vice chairman for banking supervision, spoke abut macroprudential regulation at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time in Washington, while Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker is slated to deliver a speech in New York at noon.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nOn the corporate front, Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC) announced Friday that it hired Charles Scharf as chief executive (link), ending a six-month search for a new chief. Scharf was most recently chairman and CEO of Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK).\n\nShares of Micron Technology Inc.(MU) were under pressure after the memory-chip maker reported another large earnings decline (link) and predicted a disappointing holiday season.\n\nPfizer Inc. (PFE) stock rose after the pharmaceutical giant reported favorable results in a second late-stage trial of a treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a chronic skin disease.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 1.5 basis points to 1.699%.\n\nIn commodities markets, oil futures fell Friday, extending a decline after Saudi Arabia declared a partial cease-fire in its conflict with Yemen (link), potentially easing geopolitical worries in the region. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November delivery fell about 96 cents to $55.46 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while gold prices lost 0.9% to about $1502 an ounce.\n\nIn Asia overnight, stocks traded mixed, with the China CSI 300 rising 0.3%, Japan's Nikkei 225 retreating 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index falling 0.3%. European stocks were mostly higher, as measured by the Stoxx Europe 600 .\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 09:37 ET (13:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
