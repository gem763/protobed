[Photo/Agencies]\n\nA State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office spokesperson on Wednesday expressed support for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region decision to disqualify Joshua Wong, leader of a political group advocating \"Hong Kong independence\", from the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election of the HKSAR.\n\nA returning officer in Hong Kong on Tuesday ruled Wong's nomination for the South Horizons West constituency of the Southern District Council was invalid. The District Council elections will be on Nov 24.\n\nPrevious court judgments provide for the returning officer to decide whether a candidate abides by the Basic Law based on public information, according to Ronny Tong Ka-wah, a barrister and member of the Executive Council, the chief executive's top political advisory body.\n\nSuch a decision is based on sufficient facts and sound legal ground, and it adheres to the \"one country, two systems\" principle and the Basic Law of the HKSAR, said Yang Guang, a spokesman for the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.\n\n\"The decision upholds the rule of law and ensures the seriousness and fairness of the District Council election. We agree with, and support, this decision,\" he said.\n\nYang said Wong is one of the chief culprits challenging the bottom-line of the \"one country, two systems\" principle and threatening the stability and development of Hong Kong. He has been advocating for \"Hong Kong independence\", openly claimed Hong Kong is not part of China and begged for foreign interference in recent unrest in Hong Kong.\n\n\"Fundamentally, Wong...does not meet the requirement that (District Council election) candidates must advocate the Basic Law and be loyal to the HKSAR,\" he said.\n\nXinhua contributed to this story.", "description": "A State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office spokesperson on Wednesday expressed support for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region decision to disqualify Joshua Wong, leader of a political group advocating \"Hong Kong independence\", from the 2019 District Council Ordinary Election of the HKSAR.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db92072a310cf3e97a38d21.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
