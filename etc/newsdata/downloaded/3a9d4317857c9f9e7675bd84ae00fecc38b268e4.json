Musk said operating costs were the lowest since Model 3 production started.\n\nMargin expectations are higher for Model Y than Model 3, while production costs are roughly the same as Model 3, said Tesla's chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn,\n\nModel 3 vehicles made in the Shanghai factory will have roughly the same margins as those made in Fremont, California, he said.\n\nTesla also expects to generally be cash flow positive as it has grown to the point of being self-funding. That will allow the company to invest in divisions focusing on sustainable energy, including launching the third version of its solar roof tile this week.\n\n\"For about a year and a half we stripped Tesla energy of resources,\" Musk said. \"Now that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we have restored resources to Tesla storage and solar. That's going to be really crazy growth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMusk also said Tesla was open to supplying batteries and other components to other automakers.\n\nWith Wednesday's after-hours surge, Tesla's stock has reduced its losses so far this year to 8 per cent and added about $US9 billion to its market capitalisation.\n\nBut Tesla rallies have been short-lived before. A year ago, Tesla gave a quarterly report that similarly smashed investors' expectations, igniting a rally that sent its shares 31 per cent higher over the next two months, only to see the stock decline through much of 2019 over worries about corporate governance, profitability and demand for the Model 3.\n\nInvestors in the past have shown impatience with the company's serial failures to meet financial and production targets. Earlier this month, Tesla shares slumped after the company reported delivering 97,000 vehicles for the third quarter, only 2 per cent ahead of the previous quarter.\n\nBut Tesla this time exceeded promises by Musk, who in July said the company would break even in the third quarter and turn a profit by the end of 2019.\n\nThe company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and on Wednesday said it was \"highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year\".\n\nAnalysts have questioned how rapidly Tesla's vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets.\n\nKirkhorn said Tesla saw growing order rates in all markets, with current orders exceeding those of the past three months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTesla has said it aims to produce at least 1000 Model 3 cars a week at the new Chinese factory by the end of this year, but it is unclear when it will meet year-end production targets due to uncertainties around orders, labour and suppliers.\n\nRevenue fell nearly 8 per cent to $US6.30 billion in the quarter ended September 30. Analysts had expected revenue of $US6.33 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTesla said it would gradually release nearly $US500 million of accumulated revenue tied to its \"full self-driving capabilities\", which customers can buy for $6000 even though fully automated driving is not available.\n\nKirkhorn said deferred revenue would also be released as Tesla expands its \"Smart Summon\" feature, which allows customers to operate a Tesla from 60 metres away using a smartphone app.\n\nFederal safety regulators are looking into the feature after videos began appearing online showing driverless Teslas hitting obstacles or nearly hitting other vehicles.\n\nMusk said software updates over the coming weeks would improve Summon.\n\nReuters", "description": "Elon Musk has promised a 2020 rollout of a cheaper SUV and more self-driving technology to stay ahead of larger rivals rushing into the premium electric vehicle market he created.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2648%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_17/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d51be4f6d2024c5fb760a5c3669ee4e557649a3a", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
