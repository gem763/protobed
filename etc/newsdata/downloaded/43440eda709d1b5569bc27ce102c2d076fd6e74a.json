It analyses the most common causes of male infertility \u2013 low sperm count and low motility, when sperm are poor quality and can\u2019t swim well.\n\nExSeed co-founder Morten Ulsted says that while there are home apps to help women conceive \u2013 such as trackers to tell them when they\u2019re ovulating \u2013 there are few options for men, who are often too embarrassed to seek medical advice.\n\nUsing a special linked device, the innovative programme also shows a live video of a sperm sample and offers a lifestyle programme, devised by fertility experts, which \u2013 its makers claim \u2013 will improve conception chances within 90 days (stock image)\n\nThe company surveyed 1,000 men aged 25 to 54 in the UK and found that while 43 per cent of men were concerned about their fertility, only 18 per cent wanted to get tested and just five per cent had actually been tested \u2013 a big discrepancy.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s still a stigma around male fertility problems,\u2019 said Mr Ulsted. \u2018Men don\u2019t want to go into a clinic.\n\n\u2018We thought that by creating ExSeed we could make a high-quality medical device that would create awareness of male infertility, help to tackle the stigma and remove the onus on women to get tested first.\u2019\n\nExSeed has already been used by more than 100 men in Denmark, with seven reported pregnancies to date.\n\nThe company is now planning a British trial in the hope that ExSeed \u2013 which currently costs \u00a3150 for a device and five tests \u2013 might be available on the NHS in the future.\n\nTo test sperm with ExSeed, a man places a sample on a glass slide provided, then inserts it into a special device and places this underneath his smartphone camera, allowing him to see his sample in real-time.\n\nUsing pre-programmed algorithms, the ExSeed app processes the video feed and can determine sperm quality and motility \u2013 mimicking the process undertaken in fertility labs.\n\nIt gives an instant result and then provides personalised recommendations on how to improve sperm quality and overall health. A follow-up test 90 days later will show how effective changes have been.\n\nExSeed has already been used by more than 100 men in Denmark, with seven reported pregnancies to date (stock image)\n\nThe app also facilitates access to fertility clinics and doctors.\n\nResearch shows men can do a lot to improve their fertility, such as giving up smoking and cutting down on alcohol and junk food.\n\nOne 2018 study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology demonstrated that 24 weeks of resistance training, three times a week, can help to improve sperm concentration by 25 per cent and sperm motility by 40 per cent.\n\nErik Maigaard Filtenborg, 33, a bank branch manager and his wife Philippa, 34, a TV reporter, from Copenhagen, have successfully used ExSeed to help them conceive.\n\nThey met in 2011 and, in 2015, started trying for a baby. \u2018I\u2019d never questioned my own fertility,\u2019 says Erik. \u2018But after ten months of trying, nothing was happening. The doctor shook his head and told us to go home and try some more.\u2019\n\nEarlier this year, a friend told the couple about ExSeed. The app flagged up problems with his sperm count and motility \u2013 and he was given a lifestyle plan to follow. \u2018I ate too much takeaway food and probably had too much stress,\u2019 he admits. \u2018Now I have a minimum of three balanced meals per day. I cut down on alcohol, started doing 30 minutes exercise per day and even turned off the seat heating in the car. I also take vitamin supplements and eat more fish and vegetables, and I\u2019ve cut down on sweets.\u2019\n\nWithin six months of using ExSeed, Philippa had conceived.\n\nTheir baby daughter is due in three weeks. \u2018We\u2019re convinced it has helped us achieve pregnancy, which didn\u2019t happen in the two years before,\u2019 adds Erik.\n\nFertility experts have welcomed the device.\n\nPeter Humaidan, Professor in Reproductive Endocrinology at the Fertility Clinic, Skive Regional Hospital, Denmark said: \u2018It can help detect potential problems and helps men to take action to help themselves.\u2019\n\nBut Vinod Nargund, Consultant Urologist at Create Fertility in London, urges caution, claiming ExSeed\u2019s test \u2018isn\u2019t detailed enough\u2019 and that some diseases causing sperm problems might be missed. He says: \u2018Not all patients need lifestyle advice. Some might need surgical intervention and other advice.\u2019", "description": "Danish-developed ExSeed uses the same software found in fertility clinics.
