However, White confirmed the date is indeed what the promotion is working toward.\n\n\u201cYes, we will have a fight card in (Las Vegas), but we\u2019ve got to get it done,\u201d White said, when asked about the January card. \u201cThe fight is not done yet, you know?\n\n\u201c(McGregor) had a press conference and announced he was coming back, but no deals were done. No fights are done. No contracts have been signed. But yes, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to do.\u201d\n\nMcGregor\u2019s last in-cage appearance was against Khabib Nurmagomedov in the main event of UFC 229, a title fight he lost by fourth-round submission.\n\nMcGregor\u2019s inactivity could be in part due to his recent troubles with the law. In March, McGregor was arrested after he swiped and smashed a fan\u2019s cellphone in Miami.\n\nLess than one month after the arrest, McGregor punched a patron at a pub in Ireland. Both the cell phone and pub incidents were captured on video. Eventually, McGregor spoke on the issues and said he \u201cwas in the wrong.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, McGregor was named in a New York Times report as the subject of a sexual assault investigation in Ireland, the second time that has happened this year.", "description": "It appears UFC president Dana White and Conor McGregor are on the same page for his early 2020 return.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Farah Hannoun", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Dan Tom", "Simon Samano"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/conor-mcgregor-moscow-press-conference-getty-4-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
