It is fed by sharing, not by profits.\n\n\u201cThe fire that destroys, on the other hand, blazes up when people want to promote only their own ideas, form their own group, wipe out differences in the attempt to make everyone and everything uniform.\u201d\n\nThe global spotlight has recently been on the world\u2019s largest rainforest, which is vital for the planet but is suffering from its worst outbreak of fires in years, due in part to an acceleration in deforestation.\n\nThe working document for the synod denounced in scathing terms social injustices and crimes, including murders, and suggested a Church action plan.\n\n\u201cListen to the cry of \u2018Mother Earth\u2019, assaulted and seriously wounded by the economic model of predatory and ecocidal development\u2026 which kills and plunders, destroys and devastates, expels and discards,\u201d the 80-page document said.\n\nThe run-up to the three-week synod, or assembly, saw some 260 events held in the Amazon region involving 80,000 people, in a bid to give the local populations a voice in the document.\n\nAmong those attending the synod as an observer was Sister Laura Vincuna, a missionary trying to protect the territories of the Caripuna indigenous people in the Brazilian Amazon.\n\n\u201cHelp us defend our motherland, we have no other home!\u201d she said on Saturday.\n\n\u201cEarth, water, forest: without these three elements nobody can do anything,\u201d she said on the eve of the synod.\n\n\u2013 \u2018New forms of colonialism\u2019 \u2013\n\nSunday\u2019s gathering comes as Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a climate-change sceptic, told the United Nations that the world\u2019s media were lying about the Amazon, and attacked indigenous leaders as tools of foreign governments.\n\nIn his 2015 encyclical on ecology and climate change \u201cLaudato Si\u201d, Francis denounced the destruction of the Amazonian rainforest in the name of \u201cenormous international economic interests\u201d.\n\nLast year, the world\u2019s first Latin American pope visited Puerto Maldonado, a village in southeastern Peru surrounded by the Amazon jungle, to meet thousands of indigenous Peruvians, Brazilians and Bolivians.\n\nThat trip was the first step towards the synod which opened Sunday.\n\n\u201cSo many of our brothers and sisters in Amazonia are bearing heavy crosses and awaiting the liberating consolation of the Gospel, the Church\u2019s caress of love,\u201d the pope said in his homily. \u201cFor them, and with them, let us journey together.\u201d\n\nHe also warned against \u201cthe greed of new forms of colonialism\u201d.\n\nFrancis\u2019 hopes of bringing the Catholic faith to far-flung populations will also see the bishops gathered in Rome debate a highly controversial proposal \u2014 allowing married men to become priests.\n\nThe issue deeply upsets some traditionalists, who argue that making an exception for the Amazon would open the door to the end of celibacy for priests, which is not a Church law and only dates back to the 11th century.\n\nThe German Catholic Church in particular, which has an influential progressive wing, has been hotly debating the subject.\n\nThe synod, which runs until October 27, will also reflect on making official roles for women, who already play a central part in the Amazonian Church.\n\nOf the 184 prelates at the synod, 113 hail from the Amazonian region, including 57 from Brazil.\n\nOthers taking part include 17 representatives of Amazonian indigenous peoples and ethnic groups, and 35 women \u2014 who will not have the right to vote on the final document.", "description": "Vatican City (AFP) \u2013 Pope Francis opened a synod Sunday to champion the Amazon\u2019s poverty-stricken and isolated indigenous communities by", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/b95870_representatives-amazon-rainforest-ethnic-groups-attended-synod-pope-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
