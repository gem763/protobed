The Republican governor of Indiana who will soon stand by Trump\u2019s side at the convention podium is a familiar name for many religious conservatives.\n\nA Catholic from childhood who became evangelical, Pence has repeatedly described himself as \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order.\u201d He has often put faith first in his political decision-making. Christian conservatives cheered when he signed one of the strictest abortion laws in the United States, and rooted for him as he defended a religious freedom law that companies across the country decried as a gateway to discrimination against LGBT people.\n\n[\u2018Everything is flowing nicely\u2019: The protesting women who called Mike Pence to tell him about their periods]\n\nTrump, a twice-divorced mogul more accustomed to talking about his sex life than about books of the Bible, has focused recently on shoring up the strong support he already enjoys among evangelicals. Picking Pence could easily be seen as an overture to conservative Christians.\n\n[At meeting for hundreds of conservative Christians, Trump vows to lift ban on politicking, appoint anti-abortion judges]\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got to solidify it. I guess that\u2019s why he went for Pence instead of Gingrich,\u201d said Michael Cromartie, who directs the program on Evangelicals in Civil Life at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, talking about former House speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia. \u201cFor religious conservatives in general who have some doubt about Mr. Trump\u2019s character, better to surround himself with somebody who\u2019s a rock-solid social conservative.\u201d\n\nCromartie said that while Pence wasn\u2019t widely known on the national stage until his battle over the religious freedom law last year, he was already well-known among politically concerned conservative evangelicals, starting in his years in Congress before becoming governor. In 2011, Pence led the congressional fight to defund Planned Parenthood. Conservative evangelicals have long seen Pence as a politician who shares their values, Cromartie said.\n\n[10 things you should know about Mike Pence]\n\nAfter defending the Indiana religious freedom bill for a week, while everyone from the NCAA to Angie\u2019s List threatened to refuse to do business in Indiana if it passed, Pence eventually added an amendment to the bill that said the law would not shield discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Cromartie said Pence\u2019s supporters understood his concession: \u201cHe tried his hardest and they know that.\u201d\n\nBut others say that Pence lost evangelicals\u2019 trust by signing the amendment defending gay rights.\n\nMollie Hemingway, senior editor of the conservative publication The Federalist, tweeted Thursday:\n\nMight be more accurate to say he *was* liked before recent capitulations on religious liberty, Common Core, Ocare. https://t.co/6ZQN3Z005Q \u2014 Mollie (@MZHemingway) July 14, 2016\n\nOthers agreed: They blamed Pence for altering his religious freedom bill. (RFRA, the abbreviation many used, stands for Religious Freedom Restoration Act.)\n\nall of these religious figures trying to talk up Trump look ridiculous after he picks Mr. RFRA Cave-In for VP \u2014 Chris Palko (@CTPalko) July 14, 2016\n\n.@realDonaldTrump It bothers me that Gov Pence backed away from RFRA under threat of economic boycott. https://t.co/Cco49gxAIb \u2014 Emmitt Effer \ud83d\udd39 (@emmeffer) July 4, 2016\n\n@MZHemingway Ironic: Trump chose Pence to appeal to Conservatives. He'd prob lose fewer with almost anyone else, due to RFRA \u2014 Valar Addemmis (@ValarAddemmis) July 14, 2016\n\nStill, Cromartie said, Pence enjoys the affection of much of the evangelical community, which might carry over to Trump. \u201cHe was not an unknown quantity at all. He\u2019s been respected and revered,\u201d Cromartie said of Pence. \u201cI think there are some people who say, \u2018Mr. Trump is not my candidate, but I\u2019m sure glad he\u2019s surrounded himself with Mr. Pence.'\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nWant more stories about faith?
