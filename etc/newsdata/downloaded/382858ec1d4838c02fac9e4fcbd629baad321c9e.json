Former Republican Sen. Jeff Flake recently estimated that 35 Republican senators would vote to remove Trump from office in an impeachment trial \u2014 if they could vote in private.\n\nThe cloak of privacy was dramatically pulled off one GOP senator, Mitt Romney, on Sunday when he admitted being behind the anonymous \u201cPierre Delecto\u201d Twitter account and its \u201clikes\u201d of tweets critical of Trump. Though Romney has been one of the few senators willing to criticize the president openly on his behavior toward Ukraine, which triggered the impeachment inquiry, the broader antipathy expressed via his secret account is telling.\n\nAs is the more widespread public agreement among the Utah senator\u2019s fellow Republicans with his lambasting of Trump\u2019s hasty, disorganized and chaotic decision to withdraw U.S. troops in Syria \u2014 while giving Turkey the green light to move into the area and ethnically cleanse the Kurds who have been fighting the Islamic State militant group for us. The day before Romney took to the Senate floor to denounce the move, 129 of 197 House Republicans voted for a measure disapproving of Trump\u2019s Syria retreat.\n\nFor those at home keeping track of the number of times a significant majority of congressional Republicans have bucked the president before the Syria vote, it\u2019s a resounding \u2026 once. (That time, it was over the 2017 sanctions measure retaliating against the Russian government for interfering in the 2016 election, which passed in July 2017 with a veto-proof majority despite the administration\u2019s opposition.) The Syria measure is a toothless nonbinding resolution, but it\u2019s a good start.\n\nFormer Republican Sen. Jeff Flake recently estimated that 35 Republican senators would vote to remove Trump from office in an impeachment trial \u2014 if they could vote in private. Sarah Longwell Executive director of Defending Democracy Together and Republicans for the Rule of Law\n\nIt just so happens that this unprecedented schism between elected Republicans and the president is occurring as the Democrat-controlled House conducts an impeachment inquiry. This indicates there are cracks in Trump\u2019s firewall that the impeachment process is exacerbating \u2014 creating an opportunity for Democrats to get the crucial GOP support they need for the inquiry, and any trial for removing the president that follows, if they act reasonably and responsibly.\n\nThere\u2019s no guarantee that the Syria breach will translate into more Republican backing for the impeachment inquiry, which is still focusing predominantly on Ukraine. But there\u2019s a chance. According to a poll earlier this month, almost 30 percent of Republicans favor the impeachment inquiry\u2014 a 21-point spike since July \u2014 and almost 20 percent favor a vote to remove the president.\n\nThat could create a squeeze for Republicans. From one side, the benefits of standing by Trump diminish with every shameful policy step like the surrender in Syria. From the other side, the costs of supporting him rise as a larger share of Republicans sour on him.\n\nThis pattern may be emerging already. According to some reports, it was criticism from Republicans such as Reps. Peter King and Tom Cole that convinced Trump to abandon his self-dealing plans to host the G-7 meeting at his struggling Miami resort. This skirmish with down-ballot Republicans could be an exception to the rule of blind, one-way obedience \u2014 or it could be the beginning of something much larger.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, for starters, have mustered up the courage to go even further than approving the Syria resolution. Rep. Francis Rooney refused to rule outvoting to impeach Trump, saying he was \u201cstill thinking about it.\u201d (He later walked back his comments and announced the next day that he wouldn\u2019t seek another term in Congress because he wants to be \u201ca model for term limits.\u201d)\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger hasn\u2019t held his fire on Twitter, calling the president\u2019s decision \u201cimpulsive\u201d and asking his constituents: \u201cIs this the America you grew up believing in?\u201d He has also repeatedly described Trump statements as \u201c#thingsreaganwouldntsay but @realDonaldTrump did.\u201d\n\nRep. John Shimkus, a retiring Republican, went so far as to withdraw his support for Trump entirely. He described himself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d and \u201cangry and embarrassed\u201d over the abandonment of America\u2019s allies.\n\nBut perhaps most notable is erstwhile-Trump-opponent-turned-reliable-lackey Sen. Lindsey Graham, who sharply criticized the Syria withdrawal on the Christian Broadcasting Network: \u201cI am looking for President Trump to change this. I will do anything I can to help him, but I will also become President Trump\u2019s worst nightmare\u201d if he doesn\u2019t. He added, \u201cDon\u2019t be like Obama, be like Reagan.\u201d To an evangelical audience like CBN\u2019s, comparing anyone to former President Barack Obama is the pinnacle of insults.\n\nEvangelical activists have themselves been outspoken on Trump\u2019s actions on Syria, in contrast to most of his previous policy choices. Their public frustration shows the decision has created additional fractures in the president\u2019s base of support at a time he needs all the bolstering he can get.\n\nThe last thing Democrats should do is make themselves and their agenda seem dangerous and radical to independents and Republican fence-sitters. They should pursue their impeachment inquiry with as much seriousness, dignity, bipartisanship and fairness as possible. Sarah Longwell Executive director of Defending Democracy Together and Republicans for the Rule of Law\n\nIf brave Republican politicians are willing to announce their opposition to the president in such dramatic and public fashion, it stands to reason that their meeker colleagues feel the same way but won\u2019t say it. What Democrats do next will be key in whether Trump\u2019s GOP critics gain more courage and break with him.\n\nFinding ways to peel off more congressional Republicans should be congressional Democrats\u2019 chief concern. If they are savvy, they have an opportunity to pass articles of impeachment that have bipartisan approval, forcing a trial in the Senate in which every Republican senator will have to take an up-or-down vote.\n\nThat\u2019s why this is also a test. As Napoleon is quoted (probably inaccurately) as saying, \u201cNever interfere with an enemy while he\u2019s in the process of destroying himself.\u201d The last thing Democrats should do is make themselves and their agenda seem dangerous and radical to independents and Republican fence-sitters. They should pursue their impeachment inquiry with as much seriousness, dignity, bipartisanship and fairness as possible.\n\nOtherwise, they\u2019ll waste their shot.\n\nSarah Longwell is the executive director of Defending Democracy Together and Republicans for the Rule of Law.
