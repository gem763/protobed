This is not a pessimistic holiday brochure, but the \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d no-deal Brexit document that the government was obliged to publish this week.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHowever you voted and whatever your view on the UK leaving the European Union, it could be to your travelling advantage to compare and contrast this sensitive document with the official and upbeat travel advice about a no-deal Brexit. The government is seeking assure travellers that ferries from Dover, Eurotunnel shuttles and Eurostar trains from London St Pancras \u201cwill be able to run as before\u201d.\n\nYet we learnt this week from the worst-case assumptions that they very much may not be able to run as before: \u201cUK citizens travelling to and from the EU may be subject to increased immigration checks at EU border posts. This may lead to passenger delays at St Pancras, Cheriton (Channel Tunnel) and Dover.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, airline passengers to Europe (of whom there are tens of millions) and lorry drivers (numbered in the thousands) find themselves bundled into the same statement of reassurance from the Department for Transport this month: \u201cFlights and road haulage will continue to run smoothly after the UK leaves the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances.\u201d\n\nWell, the publication of Operation Yellowhammer suggests this is an unusual use of the word \u201csmooth\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn a reasonable worst case scenario,\u201d we are told, truck drivers could face delays of two-and-a-half days.\n\nWhile airline passengers are unlikely to be held up for so long, the government believes: \u201cIt is likely that delays will occur for UK arrivals and departures at EU airports.\u201d\n\nAt least travellers will be able to fill the time with some light shopping. HM Treasury promises a silver lining to the Brexit clouds.\n\n\u201cDuty-free shopping with the EU is coming back, if we leave without a deal.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Whitehall, the Department of Health warns: \u201cThe risk of developing a range of health problems (including cancers of the mouth, throat and breast) increases the more you drink on a regular basis.\u201d And as for tobacco: \u201cSmoking is the leading cause of premature death.\u201d\n\nNevertheless the Treasury, which collects taxpayers\u2019 money, has spent some of it producing a catchy little ad promoting the Brexit price cut for alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nAs a jaunty series of drinks, including a foaming beer and a glass of red wine, parades across the screen, we are told: \u201cPeople travelling to EU countries will be able to buy beer, spirits, wine and tobacco without duty being applied in the UK.\u201d\n\nNever mind a possible shortage of food and medical supplies: the days of the Dover-Calais \u201cbooze cruise\u201d are back.
