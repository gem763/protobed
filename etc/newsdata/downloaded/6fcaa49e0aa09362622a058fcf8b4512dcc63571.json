This is not a pessimistic holiday brochure, but the Operation Yellowhammer no-deal Brexit document that the government was obliged to publish this week.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The government is seeking assure travellers that ferries from Dover, Eurotunnel shuttles and Eurostar trains from London St Pancras \u201cwill be able to run as before\u201d.\n\nYet we learnt this week from the worst-case assumptions that they very much may not be able to run as before: \u201cUK citizens travelling to and from the EU may be subject to increased immigration checks at EU border posts.

How Brexit will affect your travel to Europe 1/14 Passports British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport \u2013 notably the right of free movement within the EU27. UK passports issued from 30 March 2019 will have the words \u201cEuropean Union\u201d removed from the cover and the first page (along with the translations into Welsh and Gaelic). But they will still be burgundy. By October 2019, new British passports will have dark blue covers Getty 2/14 Pets You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply. If the UK is given \u201cPart 2 listed status\u201d, there would be some extra requirements for travelling pets and owners post-Brexit. \u201cThese would require an additional visit to the vet and some additional papers to be carried but would not prevent you from enjoying your trip,\u201d says Eurotunnel. But it adds that if the UK is given unlisted, third-country status, \u201cowners who wish to travel with their pets from the UK to EU nations will need to discuss their specific preparations and requirements with an Official Veterinarian at least four months prior to their desired travel date AFP/Getty 3/14 Eurotunnel/Eurostar The Treaty of Canterbury between the UK and France governs the Channel Tunnel link and operations will continue \u2013 subject to any local disruption at Folkestone and/or Calais AFP/Getty 4/14 Driving Motorists, whether taking their own cars or hiring abroad, are likely to need to obtain an International Driving Permit or two; different EU countries are signed up to different treaties, so for a trip embracing Spain and France you would need both types. These are currently sold from a limited number of Post Offices, but the government intends to make them widely available. The cost is \u00a35.50 for each. Motor insurance will no longer automatically extend to the EU. Insurers will provide on request a \u201cGreen Card\u201d, for which an extra charge will be made PA 5/14 Flights Even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, flights will continue to operate between the UK and European Union. However, in the event of the UK leaving with no deal, many flights are likely to be cancelled because departures would be capped at 2018 levels. As UK airlines have already announced thousands of new flights to Europe from the end of March 2019, some would have to be cancelled Getty 6/14 Air routes The network of flight links between Britain and eastern Europe could be affected by any reduction in the number of workers from those countries. Not only do they use the flights \u2013 so do their families and friends PA 7/14 Flight disruption rights Current European passengers\u2019 rights rules, known as EC261/2004, stipulate high payouts for delays and cancellations that cannot be attributed to \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d.

That means there must be at least 90 days (roughly three months) left on your passport beyond your intended date of departure. Because third-country nationals can remain in the Schengen area for 90 days, the actual check carried out could be that the passport has at least six months\u2019 validity remaining on the date of arrival Getty 9/14 Online registration prior to travel \u2013 ETIAS From 2021, non-EU nationals who do not require a visa to enter the Schengen area \u2013 including British travellers \u2013 will need to request prior authorisation to visit Schengen countries. The Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) is aimed at reducing the \u201cmigration, security or public-health risk\u201d from nationals of visa-exempt third countries, which is what the UK will become after Brexit. It costs \u20ac7 for three years AFP/Getty 10/14 \u2018Brexit clauses\u2019 A large number of travel providers \u2013 even including National Express coaches \u2013 have added \u201cBrexit clauses\u201d to their terms and conditions. These generally specify that they will not be liable for \u201cconsequential losses\u201d as a result of Brexit-related issues PA 11/14 \u2018Fast track\u2019 lanes for passport control entering EU countries British passport holders will not be able to use them, and must join the queue for third-country nationals. People holding an EU passport or ID card as well as a British passport will be able to exit the UK on the British passport but enter Europe on the EU document Getty 12/14 Ferries The ferry industry insists vessels will continue to sail. The UK Chamber of Shipping says: \u201cUnlike the carriage of cargo, trade deals do not have a significant effect on the cruise and passenger ferry industry. The explicit standardisation of commodity codes and tariffs associated with trade deals have little relevance to holidaymakers.\u201d Having said that, the government and Kent County Council are planning for possible chaos at Channel ports because of a backlog of trucks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This would impinge on holidaymakers\u2019 plans PA 13/14 European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) The EU says: \u201cIf you fall ill or have an accident during a visit to another EU country, as an EU citizen you have the right to receive the necessary public healthcare in any EU country under the same conditions as people in the host country.\u201d The EHIC also works in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Treatment, says the NHS, is \u201cat a reduced cost or, in many cases, free of charge\u201d. From 11pm GMT on 29 March 2019, when the UK ceases to belong to the European Union, British travellers will have no automatic right to use the EHIC. There is no certainty about what may replace it PA 14/14 Mobile phones From 30 March 2019, the law banning mobile phone firms from charging extra for calls and data in Europe will cease, though operators have yet to set out exactly what will replace it. In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear. But Dave Dyson, chef executive of Three, says his firm is \u201ccommitted to maintain the availability of roaming in the EU at no additional cost following Brexit\u201d AFP/Getty 1/14 Passports British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport \u2013 notably the right of free movement within the EU27.
