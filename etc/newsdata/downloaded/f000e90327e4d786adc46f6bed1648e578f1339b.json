Oh's co-star Jodie Comer and past winner Viola Davis of \"How to Get Away with Murder\" are also nominated. A victory for Clarke or any of the four \"Game of Thrones\" actresses competing for a supporting trophy (Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner, Lena Headey and Gwendoline Christie) would be the first for a woman on the show.\n\nJULIA ROBERTS ON EMMY SNUB: 'I'M IN EXCEPTIONAL COMPANY'\n\n\"Veep,\" which, like \"Game of Thrones,\" marked its final season in 2019, may also prove a recordbreaker: If star Julia Louis-Dreyfus wins, she'll be the most-honored actress in Emmy history.\n\n\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" is defending the top comedy award it captured last year, when three-time winner \"Veep\" was on hiatus.\n\nSACHA BARON COHEN THANKS SARAH PALIN, DICK CHENEY FOR 'WHO IS AMERICA' EMMY NOMINATIONS\n\nThe best drama actor nominations include Billy Porter of \"Pose,\" who would be the first openly gay man to win the award, and past winner Sterling K. Brown for \"This Is Us.\"\n\nAngela Bassett, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Hugh Laurie, Maya Rudolph, Jon Hamm, Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Randall Park are some of the scheduled presenters. Actor-comedian Thomas Lennon has the off-camera job of regaling viewers with factoids and jokes as winners head to the stage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSinger Halsey is set to perform during the in memoriam tribute.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The 2019 Emmy Awards\u00a0are going without a host, but the show and its presenters and honorees pack plenty of\u00a0star power.", "authors": ["Jessica Sager"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/ContentBroker_contentid-c1506215fb4e4b05af1686a90911f7ed.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
