Tulsi Gabbard offered a more detailed response to Hillary Clinton on Wednesday, saying she\u2019s running for president to undo the \u201cfailed legacy\u201d of Mrs. Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee and former secretary of state.\n\n\u201cFrom Iraq to Libya to Syria, her record is replete with foreign-policy catastrophes,\u201d Ms. Gabbard, Hawaii Democrat, wrote in a piece in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s a primary reason why I resigned as vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse Bernie Sanders. Mrs. Clinton and the powerful media and political network she built up over decades have never forgiven this slight. The smears have been nonstop ever since.\u201d\n\nOn a recent podcast, Mrs. Clinton suggested that Ms. Gabbard was being \u201cgroomed\u201d to mount a third-party presidential bid to boost President Trump\u2019s reelection chances.\n\nMs. Gabbard has previously said she won\u2019t run third party if she doesn\u2019t win the Democratic presidential nomination. She recently announced she won\u2019t seek reelection to Congress in 2020.\n\nMs. Gabbard said in the piece that she swore an oath to \u201conly one authority: the U.S. Constitution.\u201d\n\nShe said the back-and-forth isn\u2019t a petty \u201cspat,\u201d but rather a serious contrast in views.\n\n\u201cMrs. Clinton already lost to Mr. Trump once. Why would Democrats think a Hillary 2.0 candidate would result in anything different?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name is on the ballot or not, her foreign policy will be, as many of the Democratic candidates adhere to her doctrine of acting as the world\u2019s police, using the tools of war to overthrow governments we don\u2019t like, wasting taxpayer dollars, costing American lives, causing suffering and destruction abroad, and undermining America\u2019s security,\u201d she continued.\n\nMs. Gabbard said people who follow the \u201cBush-Clinton doctrine\u201d believe \u201cthe only way to interact with other nations is by bombing them or starving them with draconian sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly when we recognize the failings of the past \u2014 embodied by Mrs. Clinton and her minions in the media \u2014 can we move forward to a future of peace, dignity, transparency and aloha,\u201d she concluded.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
