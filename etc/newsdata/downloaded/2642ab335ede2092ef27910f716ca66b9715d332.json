I am in Taipei to speak on whether U.S.-China strains endanger Taiwan. I think not. Certainly, President Donald Trump, Shinzo Abe in Japan and Scott Morrison in Australia \u2014 three key countries for Taiwan \u2014 show no sign of reduced support. A slew of lesser Asian countries may hesitate to help Taiwan in a crisis, but all prefer a separate Taiwan to the island being swallowed into the People\u2019s Republic. Such a disaster would bring the greatest change in East Asia\u2019s balance of power since the second world war.\n\nConsider that during seven decades of Washington-Beijing ups and downs, Taiwan was unscathed. Today, the island is more prosperous and confident of its identity than ever. Its existence is a textbook case of deterrence working. Thanks, Uncle Sam and Japan.\n\nEconomic stagnation on the mainland, which is quite possible, would not destabilize Taiwan. Political crisis in the mainland, much less likely, would harm Taiwan because of the flight of urban Chinese from Shanghai and other cities. Yet, leaving aside gyrations in U.S.-China relations and non-stop military calculations of both the PLA and Pentagon, demographic trends and tricks, and the stealth and reach of social media, could together destroy Taiwan as a democracy without a shot being fired.\n\nPopulation totals favor China. Russian people are a drop in the bucket alongside Chinese. Siberia faces a Chinese population surge, as Russia\u2019s birth rate and economy lag China\u2019s; Russia\u2019s economy is one-eighth the size of China\u2019s. Australia, with only 23 million people, may become a Chinese-flavored nation, as it once was British-flavored.\n\nTaiwan is more vulnerable than Russia, Australia or many others to demographic games. Sichuan Province (90 million) has four times the people in Taiwan (23 million). It would take only a tiny slice of the young males there, or equivalent numbers from Taiwan\u2019s close neighbor Fujian Province (40 million), if \u201cencouraged\u201d by Beijing to go to Taiwan as \u201ctourists,\u201d then marry Taiwan girls \u2014 to produce a demographic reset of Taiwan\u2019s democracy. No submarines or soldiers required.\n\nSubjectively, one feels Taiwan\u2019s vulnerability when flying from Shanghai to Taipei; from communism to capitalism \u2014 yet fewer minutes than a hop from Chicago to Boston.\n\nChina cleverly uses the web to further a world future for socialist authoritarianism. Professor Hsu Chien-jung of National Dong Hwa University in Taipei began his research on Beijing\u2019s electronic assault by asking a question: Why do huge numbers of Chinese individuals subscribe to Facebook when Beijing blocks Facebook for PRC Chinese? How many Americans know that millions of Chinese adherents to Facebook are physically in Taiwan? These selected \u201cTaiwan folk\u201d are a fifth column devised by Beijing. They spout Beijing\u2019s policies to Facebook \u201cfriends.\u201d\n\nPolitical influence is the tip of a seismic social iceberg. Culture and technology give youth new enjoyments, as they offer China new weapons. Reality looks different to teen-agers than to their parents; youth make their own reality and others will try to make it for them. \u201cYou may think you\u2019re talking to a pretty lady or a handsome man,\u201d says Mr. Hsu, \u201cbut it\u2019s a robot somewhere, spitting out opinions.\u201d\n\nWith a new Chinese app called Zao, a kid may fix her head on the body of a sports hero or pop star and say whatever she likes. A \u201cJimmy Lai face\u201d can opine day and night that Taiwan belongs to China (not the Hong Kong media magnate\u2019s real view). Who speaks; Who listens? We don\u2019t know, even in a world where anything goes and almost everything is presumed known.\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote of Big Brother controlling a society. China could be a Global Big Brother electronically shaping international public opinion. Easy for selected Communist whiz-kids in Shanghai to reset minds, say in Vietnam, via the Internet. Much simpler than Beijing sending tanks and an army across the China-Vietnam border.\n\nA rising power is always tempted to push the envelope. The United States, like China, is an \u201cunconscious empire,\u201d often unwitting about its huge reach. Since 1945, Washington has trespassed on other countries in its own way. Today, timing offers China the Internet as a perfect tool to do the same and more.\n\nIn recent years, PRC money has bought its way into Taiwan media. The Taiwanese newspaper the China Times, says scholar Hsu, \u201cseems to be a representative of Xinhua [the CCP news agency] in Taiwan.\u201d It is a giant step beyond print, to target individuals in Taiwan by invisible, deniable, anonymous electronic tricks. Reading a book or newspaper is an act initiated by an individual from below. The Internet, from above \u2014 from somewhere \u2014 makes the individual a target.\n\nTaiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who hankers for Taiwan independence, fears a huge, if under the table, effort to vote her out of power in January. True, the CCP has overreached before in its 70 years in power, regretting it later (and to be fair, fake voices are less horrible than real bombs). Beijing has shown with its Confucius Institutes that Chinese soft power can backfire. It may overreach on Taiwan, as it already did in Hong Kong. However, it is a fact that tidy millions of pro-CCP Chinese youth are in the world vanguard of IT.\n\nIf this spooky stuff ultimately becomes a free speech issue, the West will prevail. If it is won on high-tech skill, not so clear. Internet attacks peacefully entering Taiwan living rooms 24 hours a day may consign submarines and soldiers to the museum. If this becomes the war of the future, asks Daniel Hahn in the Spectator, \u201ccan we ever have peace again?\u201d Numbers and technology, linked, are a formidable weapon.\n\n\u2022 Ross Terrill\u2019s books include \u201cMao\u201d and \u201cThe New Chinese Empire.\u201d His next book is \u201cFrom the Bush to Tiananmen\u201d (Rowman and Littlefield).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
