Kia plans to take the excitement several notches higher by crafting a fun contest \u2013 one that\u2019ll make music buffs go gaga.

Seriously guys, missing an opportunity like this is just not an option.\n\nBut Hey, What Exactly Is K-Pop?\n\nFor most of us, Psy\u2019s Gangnam style opened the doors to a quirky music genre K-Pop, short for Korean pop. However, it so much more than that one song. Vivid storytelling, dynamic self expression, better than runway fashion, topped with a splash of colour is what K-pop stands for.\n\nWhat Makes Blackpink Stand Out?\n\nBlackpink has a string of number-one hits to its name, and is certainly the next big thing in K-Pop. The band made a promising debut in 2016 with Boombayah. Further, they created history by becoming the first K-Pop girl band to perform at Coachella. Commendable, right?\n\nAnd while most of us would've scratched our heads, wondering what to do this winter, Kia made the decision a whole lot simpler. So, participate in this contest, buzz your friends who might be interested, and try your talent at this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!", "description": "With a massive wave of fan-following across the globe, South Korean girl band \u2018Blackpink\u2019 is on the highroad to smashing success.
