As dusk fell, his team began the process to close down a firm that has been providing holidays for 178 years.\n\nThe hardest-hit people are the 21,000 staff, 9,000 of whom were employed by the UK operation \u2013 mainly in travel agencies in hundreds of towns and cities, but also at the company\u2019s headquarters in Peterborough and in resorts abroad.\n\nMore than 150,000 British holidaymakers who are currently abroad with Thomas Cook are relatively fortunate, because the government has assured them that they will be brought back with a massive repatriation exercise called \u201cOperation Matterhorn\u201d.\n\nA fleet of 40 aircraft chartered by the Civil Aviation Authority is on standby to operate hundreds of flights to bring the holidaymakers home.

In the meantime air fares and holiday prices will soar as other travel firms take advantage of the surge in demand.\n\nThomas Cook was the pioneer of organised travel, beginning with a Temperance outing from Leicester to Loughborough in 1841.\n\nThe travel firm that he founded prospered through the second half of the 19th century and, with allowances for world wars, thrived through much of the 20th century.\n\nIn 2007 Thomas Cook merged with Mytravel to become one of the biggest holiday companies in Europe \u2013 with operations in Germany, Scandinavia, Russia and elsewhere.\n\nBut scale and a strong brand proved no guarantee of enduring success in travel.\n\nThe low-cost aviation revolution and a series of corporate misadventures left Thomas Cook badly wounded in 2011. Although it made a recovery, the firm has been struggling compared with its huge rival Tui and the relative youngster Jet2.\n\nThomas Cook proved slow in adapting to the changing market. While its rivals were creating premium products, Thomas Cook continued selling low-margin commoditised holidays \u2013 such as a week in Greece for under \u00a3200.", "description": "At 11.30pm on Sunday night, Thomas Cook sold a package holiday to Greece: a bargain \u00a3187 for a week in Corfu in October.
