(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump is not the first American president staring down impeachment to nurse a deep sense of persecution and self-pity. But he is the first to broadcast that mentality to the world.\n\nIn the five days since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) opened an impeachment inquiry following revelations about Trump\u2019s conduct with his Ukrainian counterpart, Trump has been determined to cast himself as a singular victim in a warped reality \u2014 a portrayal that seems part political survival strategy, part virtual therapy session.\n\nAs Trump tells it, he is a hard-working and honorable president whose conduct has been \u201cperfect\u201d but who is being harassed and tormented by \u201cDo Nothing Democrat Savages\u201d and a corrupt intelligence community resolved to perpetuate a hoax, defraud the public and, ultimately, undo the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThere has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have,\u201d Trump tweeted early Wednesday, some 13 hours after Pelosi\u2019s announcement.\n\nVictimization always has been core to Trump\u2019s identity, both as a politician and as a real estate promoter and reality-television star. It is the emotional glue that yokes Trump to the grievance politics of the right. Many of Trump\u2019s grass roots followers have said they feel protective of the president in part because they, too, feel oppressed and ostracized by elites.\n\n[Trump writes the GOP impeachment playbook: Scorched earth. But will it work?]\n\nAs Congress considers impeaching him over his request that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his family as well as an unsubstantiated theory that Ukrainians worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election, Trump is claiming a broad conspiracy to erase history. He has sought to stitch together his existing narrative about the Russia investigation with the emerging probe of his Ukraine episode into a seamless \u201cdeep state\u201d story line \u2014 in part by trying to discredit an urgent complaint about his conduct with Zelensky from an intelligence community whistleblower.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been forecasting that the \u2018deep state\u2019 is out to get him and there\u2019s a way in which the narrative of the whistleblower can come to confirm all of that for his followers,\u201d said historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat, an expert on authoritarianism at New York University.\n\n\n\nVice President Pence and President Trump deliver remarks to Hispanic community, business and faith leaders at the White House on Sept. 27, 2019. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThis shared sense of persecution is one reason so many Republican officeholders and conservative media personalities are defending the president \u2014 at least for now \u2014 against allegations that he abused the power of his office for personal political gain.\n\n\u201cAt a Trump rally, central to the show is the idea of shared victimization,\u201d said Republican strategist Steve Schmidt, a Trump critic. \u201cDonald Trump revels in it, has consistently portrayed himself as a victim of the media and of his political opponents, and this will all be framed as an unfair effort to overturn a legitimate election. That argument will have enormous currency across right-wing media. It will be believed.\u201d\n\n[Republicans might oppose impeachment, but do they condone what Trump did?]\n\nAt the heart of Trump\u2019s case is his obsession with the 2016 election, the results of which he boasts about in historic terms despite the asterisk over Russia\u2019s interference campaign to boost his candidacy, as well as the fact that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn the nearly three years since, Trump has tried to re-litigate his election by discounting \u2014 and, in some instances, rejecting outright \u2014 the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russia interfered, and by proving that he defeated Clinton soundly in the electoral college entirely on his own superior abilities as a candidate.\n\n\u201cWe won [the] election, convincingly. Convincingly,\u201d Trump told reporters last week. Invoking communications between former FBI officials, he continued, \u201cThen you had the text message on, well, if she doesn\u2019t win, we\u2019ve got an insurance policy. How bad was that? You know the insurance policy? That\u2019s sort of what has been taking place over the last number of years \u2014 the insurance policy. No, there are a lot of very dishonest people. We\u2019re the ones that played it straight.\u201d\n\nAt the same news conference Tuesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Trump reminisced about his winning strategy in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf you go by the college, electoral college, that\u2019s a much different race than running popular vote,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s like the 100-yard dash or the mile. You train differently. And I can\u2019t help it that my opponent didn\u2019t go to Wisconsin and should have gone much more to Michigan and Pennsylvania and other places. But that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) walks to a lectern at the Capitol to formally announce an impeachment inquiry into President Trump on Sept. 24, 2019. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRick Wilson, another GOP strategist and Trump critic, likened the president to \u201cthe guy circling the high school parking lot in his Camaro five years after he graduated. He always wants to go back to 2016 and his victory. That\u2019s the triumphal arc of his history. And he\u2019s always trying to go back to having a fight about Hillary Clinton and her emails and the servers, straight from the greatest hits album.\u201d\n\nFor instance, when Trump met with Zelensky last Wednesday, he called Clinton\u2019s deletion of emails \u201cone of the great crimes committed\u201d and speculated without evidence that they \u201ccould very well\u201d reside on a server in Ukraine.\n\nBen-Ghiat drew parallels between Trump\u2019s strategy and the tactics of leaders with authoritarian tendencies past and present around the world. She said Trump\u2019s branding of investigations against him as \u201cwitch hunts\u201d mirrors the language used by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi to condemn probes into their conduct.\n\n\u201cTheir cult of victimization is part of their persona,\u201d Ben-Ghiat said. \u201cIt\u2019s how they get support for people. It\u2019s how they justify lashing out. A lot of their repressive agenda is against the press, the intelligence communities, anybody with investigatory capabilities.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s aides, however, argue that the president\u2019s sense of being under siege is justified because Democrats decided long ago they wanted to remove him from office and have now settled on his call with the Ukrainian president as their best case after months of failing to rally around other rationales.\n\n\u201cPeople were talking about impeaching this president before he even got inaugurated. Now they are getting their wish,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, told reporters Friday. \u201cNancy Pelosi finally capitulated to her angry mob.\u201d\n\n[Effort to shield Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian leader was part of broader secrecy effort]\n\nTrump\u2019s victim mentality has historical precedent \u2014 including with the 17th president, Andrew Johnson, who ascended after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1865 assassination. He was impeached by the House, acquitted in the Senate and did not stand for election at the end of his term, having failed to win his party\u2019s nomination in 1868.\n\nAs president, Johnson delivered diatribes laced with self-pity and indignation that he was being unfairly persecuted and not appreciated by the American people as the simple man devoted to the Constitution that he thought himself to be, according to Brenda Wineapple, a historian and author of \u201cThe Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople were shocked at the first tirade they heard and thought [Johnson] must be drunk, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Wineapple said. \u201cIt was so similar to today as to be scary. Both men felt a victimization and a sense of being martyred by a radical group of fanatics not out to save the country but out to get them.\n\nThe media being what it was in the 19th century, Johnson\u2019s remarks were not nearly as widely disseminated as Trump\u2019s are today.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump steps off Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Sept. 26, 2019. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the modern era, both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton tended to feelings of victimhood in the confidences of their families and staffs during their respective impeachment battles. Nixon resigned before facing a verdict, while Clinton was acquitted in the Senate. But neither president aired his emotions quite like Trump, who announces his grievances every few hours on Twitter and in regular media appearances.\n\nLanny Davis, one of Clinton\u2019s lawyers and crisis strategists, said his client tried to be keep his public comments focused on the facts of his case, although he acknowledged that the first lady implanted the notion of a \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d\n\n[Seven days: Inside Trump\u2019s frenetic response to the whistleblower complaint and the battle over impeachment]\n\nDavis now represents Trump lawyer-turned-critic Michael Cohen. In Trump\u2019s situation, he said, \u201ca strategy based on the Democrats ganging up on me or being persecuted won\u2019t work among the people who are voting on impeachment because of the transcript of his telephone conversation. It\u2019s his own words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do when you have facts that are terrible and you can\u2019t change, can\u2019t delete, can\u2019t sweep them under the rug?\u201d Davis added. \u201cThe competitive narrative that the Democrats are persecuting me just ignores the elephant in the room.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attitude is shared by his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose own work in Ukraine looks to figure prominently in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nGiuliani revealed this mind-set in a phone call last week with Elaina Plott, a reporter from The Atlantic.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible that the whistleblower is a hero and I\u2019m not. And I will be the hero! These morons \u2014 when this is over, I will be the hero,\u201d Giuliani told her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not acting as a lawyer. I\u2019m acting as someone who has devoted most of his life to straightening out government,\u201d Giuliani continued. \u201cAnything I did should be praised.\u201d", "description": "Part strategy, part therapy, Trump puts his feelings of persecution and self-pity on hourly display, claiming a vast conspiracy to undo his 2016 election.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/dITbeoOxnlkzZ00xubSTc64b2nE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V2SDI5HBQ4I6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
