But it was in the northeastern regional capital, Barcelona, where police charged at protesters after some hurled firecrackers and other objects at the officers and kicked temporary fences put in place to protect the building.\n\nThe protesters sang the Catalan anthem and shouted, \u201cThe streets will always be ours,\u201d \u201dIndependence,\u201d as well as slogans calling Spanish police \u201coccupying forces\u201d and urging them to leave Catalonia. They erected improvised barricades with trash bins, fences, and piles of cardboard that they set on fire.\n\nThe evening vigils, also in Girona, Lleida and Tarragona, as well as smaller towns across Catalonia, had been called by ANC and Omnium, two grassroots pro-secession groups whose leaders Jordi S\u00e1nchez and Jordi Cuixart were sentenced on Monday to nine years in prison for sedition.\n\nSeven politicians were also given prison terms of around a decade in Monday\u2019s landmark Supreme Court ruling and three more were fined for disobeying the laws as they pushed ahead with a banned referendum on Oct. 1, 2017, and briefly declaring independence based on its results before Spain crushed the defiance.\n\nActivists also blocked highways, smaller roads and railway tracks for brief periods on Tuesday, following an attempt to besiege Barcelona\u2019s international airport the night before that left thousands of passengers stranded. Many, desperate to catch their flights, were forced to walk with their luggage on highways and across fields.\n\nAuthorities said that three people were arrested and more than 170 others injured in Monday\u2019s protests, including about 40 police officers and a protester who lost an eye. The airport authority said that 110 flights were canceled on Monday and 45 on Tuesday. Nearly 1,000 were operating normally, AENA said.\n\nMost impromptu protests are responding to an online campaign by Tsunami Democratic, a loose, leaderless grassroots group that uses encrypted messaging apps to call for peaceful disobedience.\n\nSpain\u2019s caretaker interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, said that authorities were investigating the group.\n\nThe court also barred the 12 convicted Catalan separatists from holding public office. That has an immediate impact in the upcoming Nov. 10 Spanish election because six of them were planning to run as candidates to the national parliament.\n\nThe verdict is likely to be a central issue in the run up to the vote but \u201cit is unlikely to substantially alter the electoral outlook unless the situation worsens significantly in the region,\u201d said Antonio Barroso, a political risk analyst with the London-based Teneo consulting firm.\n\nHe said Catalan separatist politicians wanted to use the backlash against the ruling to woo pro-independence voters to the polls.\n\nOthers have feared that swelling support for Catalan separatism because of the sentences could make the next political term even more key to either breaking the deadlock with separatists or making it a chronicle problem. Spain\u2019s caretaker prime minister and Socialist leader, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who won the April election but failed to get support for a minority government, is hoping to remain in office.\n\nBut even from the early hours after the 493-page Supreme Court ruling was issued, very different views emerged from Madrid and Catalonia. While S\u00e1nchez called for beginning a \u201cnew phase\u201d and urged Catalan separatists to abide by the law, the ruling invigorated the wealthy region\u2019s independence movement, with many of its leaders making new calls to work toward effective secession or repeating the slogan \u201cwe will do it again.\u201d\n\nCuixart told the Associated Press by email via his lawyer that he and the others sentenced by the Supreme Court will take their case to the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n\u201cWe have the moral obligation to denounce (Spain\u2019s) authoritarian drift and appeal to European citizens to defend human rights,\u201d Cuixart Tuesday.\n\nThe Catalan regional president, Quim Torra, said secessionists won\u2019t give up their fight.\n\n\u201cA referendum is the most positive solution for solving this situation,\u201d he told foreign reporters in Barcelona on Tuesday.\n\nThe caretaker Spanish foreign minister, Josep Borrell, soon due to become the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, said the sentence wasn\u2019t resolving the underlying political problems that only dialogue \u201cin the framework of the Constitution\u201d could.\n\nSpain\u2019s constitutional law says that the country is indivisible.\n\n\u201cYesterday, today and tomorrow it is and remains a political problem that has to be solved,\u201d Borrell told foreign reporters, adding that Catalan separatists shouldn\u2019t ignore Catalans like him who are against independence.\n\n\u201cWhen one excludes part of the population because they don\u2019t think like one, and only considers as the people those who think like one, this is a totalitarian attitude,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, a former member of the Catalan regional government who was among the sentenced told the AP that he regretted that the situation ended so badly.\n\nSanti Vila, who evaded a prison sentence but was fined for disobedience, said \u201cwe should have been more capable of creating a framework of trust between the government of Catalonia and the government of Spain\u201d so as \u201cto put the conflict on the right track.\u201d\n\nConsidered a traitor by the pro-independence camp, Vila resigned as Catalonia\u2019s business minister a day before the Catalan Parliament unilaterally declared secession on October 27, 2017.\n\nProtests are likely to extend throughout the week. A three-day student strike begins Wednesday in the region, and a worker\u2019s union has called a separate strike for Friday.\n\n___\n\nAritz Parra reported from Madrid.
