So when she happened across a story online about Belize being the next hot retirement destination about seven years ago, she almost immediately booked a flight.\n\n\u201cI got to Belize and fell in love. It\u2019s raw \u2014 not like Hawaii or Mexico \u2014 people are very nice, it\u2019s English speaking, I just found it so fascinating and thought this might be an interesting place to do a coffee shop,\u201d Houghton tells MarketWatch, adding that she\u2019d wanted to open a coffee shop abroad for years because it\u2019s often hard to find a decent cup of coffee when you travel.\n\n\u201cI was 56, I was on my own, my worst-case scenario was I go back home and pick up where I left off,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen I die I want to go down kicking, say I tried it. I hate winter. For me, this was an adventure. Who does that \u2014 who goes to a Caribbean country in their 50s and says to hell with it? That was part of the appeal \u2014 why the hell not do it?\u201d\n\nThen something unexpected happened: After a couple visits to Belize, the singleton booked her plane ticket to move to Ambergris Caye -\u2014 a gorgeous, laid-back tropical island popular with tourists and expats \u2014 in May 2013 for a November flight; by June she\u2019d met a man. \u201cSometimes the universe puts interesting things in your way,\u201d she says with a laugh.\n\nMarlene Houghton Marlene Houghton and her partner Rob at their home in Belize.\n\nAt first, she thought the relationship might just stay casual \u2014 \u201cI said to him, you know I\u2019m heading out in November, if you want to have fun this summer then I\u2019m in, but I am leaving\u201d \u2014 but they fell in love, and moved to Belize together that year. (Her partner, Rob, who was retired when they met.) They bought a home, and on the property next to it built a bed & breakfast and a coffee shop (altogether now worth an estimated $1.3 million). (She rented out her home in Canada and sold property to get funds to buy the coffee shop; he was a real estate investor.)\n\n\u201cI have been so blessed to realize this dream,\u201d she says, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019ve met interesting people \u2014 and annoying people \u2014 I\u2019ve done things that I would not have done under other circumstances.\u201d Here\u2019s what life is like in Ambergris Caye, Belize \u2014 including costs, health care, entertainment, crime and more \u2014 and why Houghton now plans to leave the island she loves for the United States.\n\nThe area: Madonna has been all over the world, but it\u2019s Ambergris Caye she sings about in \u201cLa Isla Bonita\u201d that it \u201cis where I long to be \u2026 the beautiful island.\u201d She\u2019s right about that: \u201cEncircled by the second largest coral reef in the world, lined with mangrove and palm trees, and dotted with waterfalls and lagoons, Ambergris Caye looks like a real-life postcard,\u201d MarketWatch wrote it its recent story about where to retire in the Caribbean.\n\nThere\u2019s also plenty to do here: \u201cThe coral reef offers diving, snorkeling and fishing options (the island is the self-proclaimed dive capital of Central America); there are more than 500 species of birds on the island (you\u2019ll frequently see people with binoculars glued to their eyes); and there is a championship golf course. And it\u2019s easy to get around town, with golf carts the most common mode of transportation,\u201d MarketWatch writes. Houghton adds that she loves the food on the island \u2014 you can get everything from a simple meal of tacos for under $5 to a five-star dining experience for upwards of $50.\n\nAlaia Belize A view of the Alaia Belize resort\n\nFor Texas native Shannon Martin, 50, who recently bought two condos at the Alaia Belize resort \u2014 a beachfront 155-unit resort, where prices start at $199,000 \u2014 the people are what stand out. \u201cThe people are the friendliest people you will ever meet. Everybody greets you, tells you a story, stops to say \u2018hi.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe cost: Though Mar and Rob\u2019s situation is unique \u2014 they don\u2019t pay rent since they own their home \u2014 she says that: \u201cRob estimated when we first moved here that it would cost two of us to live very comfortably about $49,000 USD a year. That is everything you could imagine to live with.\u201d\n\nRents aren\u2019t super cheap: For example, Mar rents out the two apartments on her property for about $750 and $1,100 per month each, and she says that you can get a one-bedroom oceanfront condo for about $1,500 a month. She estimates expenses for groceries are about $350-$400 a month, though she notes that you may spend more if you opt for imported foods. (She\u2019s seen a bag of Lay\u2019s potato chips, for example, sell for about $6.)\n\nMarlene Houghton Mar and Rob\u2019s B&B\n\nMar\u2019s electricity for the past month with two air-conditioning units was about $300, she says, while TV, cable and internet total about $100 a month. Gas is pricey at about $6 a gallon, but many people get around town in golf carts (which can you buy, though it takes \u201ca pile of paperwork\u201d to do it, Mar says.).\n\nInternational Living magazine estimates that, if you\u2019re frugal, you can get by on $2,000 a month. Sample monthly expenses might include:\n\nRent: $850\n\nElectricity: $250\n\nWater: $35\n\nCellphone: $50\n\nInternet and landline: $35\n\nCable TV: $24\n\nTransportation: $50\n\nGym membership: $100\n\nFood: $600\n\nTOTAL: $1,994\n\nSource: International Living\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that living on Ambergris Caye is often more expensive than other parts of Belize, in part because many things have to be shipped onto the island. For example, Houghton points out that brand-name items can be pricey, as can electricity. Real estate too, depending on what you buy, can be expensive \u2014 with some spots going for upwards of $1 million.\n\niStock The main street in San Pedro where the main source of powered transportation is golf carts.\n\nHealth care: For small health issues, there\u2019s a clinic on the island, and for more serious things, people tend to go to Belize City on the mainland or to Merida, a large city in Mexico, Mar says. Health care is inexpensive in general; Houghton says she pays about $25 for a routine doctor\u2019s visit on the mainland. But she says she\u2019ll go back to Canada if she needs a major procedure done.\n\nResidency/visa: Belize\u2019s Qualified Retired Person (QRP) visa is \u201cone of the most accessible retirement programs available,\u201d sister publication Barron\u2019s wrote earlier this year \u2014 and is available to retired people over 45 who can prove income of at last $2,000 per month. Its perks include tax exemptions on income, but it does cost $1,000 to apply.\n\nCons: The fact that you may need to leave the island for quality, major medical care may be a big drawback for many retirees, and there are less expensive options if you want to retire by the beach. And Ambergris Caye does not have a large airport (you must go to the mainland for that). Plus, the U.S. government has put the country of Belize at a Level 2 on its travel advisory, asking travelers to \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d due to crime.\n\nMarlene Houghton The MarBucks coffee shop\n\nBottom line: Though Houghton says she loves Belize, she\u2019s put her home, coffee shop and B&B on the market and plans to set up a new home base in the United States. The reason? Her business has done so well she\u2019s working more hours than she wants to at 63. \u201cWe\u2019re reaping what we sowed,\u201d she says. \u201cBut now we want to do more traveling.\u201d\n\nStill, she says, they plan to get a condo in Belize so they can maintain the close friendships they\u2019ve built there. \u201cFor me, it was an adventure \u2014 it is an adventure,\u201d she says.", "description": "She moved to this beautiful, laid-back island in 2013.
