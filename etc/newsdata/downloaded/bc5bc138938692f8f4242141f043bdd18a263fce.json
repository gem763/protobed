He told me he wasn\u2019t going anywhere without his dog.\n\n\u2018I persuaded him to come and stay with us while we got things sorted, but I could see how much he loved Harry.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s had this dog for 11 years, he\u2019s all he\u2019s got, and I just thought \u201cthis is what care is about \u2013 we have to find a way to keep them together\u201d.\n\n\u2018I believe good care needs to be person centred and planned around the person\u2019s needs and wishes. As care home providers, we plan holistically, looking at an individual\u2019s mental and social factors, as well as medical.\u2019\n\nDavid said he will not let anything come in between him and Harry again and thanked Marie and staff at the care home for reuniting them.\n\nDavid has vowed never to be separated from Harry again (Picture: ncjMedia)\n\n\u2018I\u2019m grateful for the help and support he has received since coming into Allan Court,\u2019 said the pensioner.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve vowed that Harry and I are not going to be separated again.\u2019\n\nHarry had to stay in kennels while Marie organised vet checks, risk assessments and ensured the home would be safe for both Harry, David, and the other residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow the dog has his very own care plan, just like the human residents, with staff organising a schedule to ensure he is fed and walked.\n\nAnd Marie said it\u2019s made the world of difference to David.\n\nShe added: \u2018Since we brought the dog in he\u2019s a new man, he\u2019s been going outside more, he seems really different. He was properly down and depressed without him\u2026\n\n\u2018There was a lot of organising to bring Harry in, but it was worth it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Fiercely independent\u2019 David said he enjoyed his stay at the home since Harry joined but is looking forward to them both going back home.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
