Nobody cares about no Lineal championship- when has anyone gone 12-rounds for a make believe belt.\n\n\"Did you see the belt there? But do what you gotta do, promote how you think will help. I'm just expressing my opinion, I don't care what they do.\n\n\"But when the rematch comes, make sure you be there. That's all that matters to me.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWilder will take on Luis Ortiz on November 23, with a win for the Bronze Bomber most likely confirming the rematch with Fury.\n\nThere was panic among Fury's camp when the 31-year-old appeared to be injured after Strowman attacked him while he was training for his debut fight, but Fury later insisted: \"I hurt my ankle but it wasn't too damaging.\n\n\"It was more annoying because he came out of nowhere and I didn't see him coming. I didn't know he was going to turn up.\n\n\"I am an athletic person and a very quick learner. I have been in the gym for the last two weeks. Everything has been practiced.\"", "description": "A world title rematch between the heavyweight fighters has been pencilled in for February but Wilder appears to have little interest in Fury's WWE career", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20722207.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Deontay-Wilder-v-Dominic-Breazeale-Deontay-Wilder-Workout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
