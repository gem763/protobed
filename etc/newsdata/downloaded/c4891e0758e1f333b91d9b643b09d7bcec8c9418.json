Now, he's sharing the fun way he occasionally approaches attendance with his 198,000 Instagram followers.\n\n\"What's really been the most exciting is not so much the attention,\" Boffone told \"Good Morning America.\" \"I've had teachers connect across the country who want to know how to implement these things in their classroom. They see me connect with the students in a way that the education department doesn't necessarily do.\"\n\nGet our full coverage to head back to school like a boss and own the school year.\n\nBoffone and two of his students appeared on \"GMA's\" broadcast during the last school year, in May 2019, and showed off their moves.\n\nBoffone said when the school year began, his father died, and once he began building relationships with his students, it helped him heal and fall in love with teaching again.\n\nBoffone said he started Dubsmashing when he saw his students took an interest in it.
