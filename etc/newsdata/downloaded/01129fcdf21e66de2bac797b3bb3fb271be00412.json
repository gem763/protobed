General Assembly. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) More\n\nObama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize more than a year and a half into his first term of office. In its announcement, the committee said it was giving it to Obama \u201cfor his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\u201d and singled out his \u201cvision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Obama noted that it was unusual that he was receiving the prize at the beginning of his presidential term.\n\n\u201cCompared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize \u2014Schweitzer and King, Marshall and Mandela \u2014 my accomplishments are slight,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBut Obama also noted that \u201cthroughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement. It\u2019s also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes, and that\u2019s why I will accept this award as a call to action \u2014 a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The president lashes out at the Nobel Peace Prize committee for giving the award to his predecessor.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GmhZ8d_97QwimGuy8h5n4Q--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/72ff0470-de31-11e9-83fe-cb18f2859f63", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
