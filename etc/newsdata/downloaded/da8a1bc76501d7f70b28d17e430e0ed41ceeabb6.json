Ho\u2019s insult would be considered crude and sexist in any language, but it was particularly ugly when uttered in Cantonese because it recalled an insulting term long used against women who have sex with foreign men.\n\nAs recounted by Coconuts Hong Kong, the ensuing fracas in the LegCo chamber resulted in the towering irony of the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s man Ho invoking his free speech rights to defend his insult at Mo:\n\nHo\u2019s comments prompted outraged responses from pro-democracy lawmakers across the committee room, including People Power lawmaker Ray Chan, who yelled that the comments were \u201charmful to women,\u201d and Civic Party lawmaker Jeremy Tam, who urged female lawmakers from the pro-Beijing side to ask themselves if Ho\u2019s comments were offensive. After being asked by [meeting president Dennis] Kwok repeatedly if he would apologize for his comments and retract them, Ho refused, saying he was exercising \u201cfreedom of expression.\u201d He also said that \u201cduring the meeting, Cheng Chung-tai has just told me eat s**t, and Lam Cheuk-ting called me scum.\u201d \u2026 Kwok then asked the LegCo security guards to escort Ho out of the room as pro-democracy lawmakers banged their desks and yelled for Ho to get out.\n\nLam refused to apologize or recant for calling Ho \u201cscum\u201d and departed the chamber on his own, telling Kwok he did not want to make his job any more difficult. Cheng retracted his comments and remained for the rest of the meeting.\n\nFor her part, Claudia Mo denounced Junius Ho\u2019s verbal assault as \u201cblatantly sexist and racist,\u201d and said it \u201camounts to sexual harassment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe that in this legislature that we could have somebody who could go that low, and I want to put it on the record that this person is just unfit to stay on as a legislator, and he\u2019s a shame to the legal profession in Hong Kong,\u201d she said.\n\nMo was even more forceful in denouncing Ho on Twitter, where everyone is more forceful at denouncing everything. She called him a \u201cpiece of rubbish\u201d that should be \u201ctrashed.\u201d She indicated she would press her complaint against Ho with both LegCo officials and Hong Kong professional organizations.\n\nMo, 62, is married to veteran Asia-based British journalist Philip Bowring. Mo herself was a journalist before she became a politician. The couple has two sons.\n\nMo and Ho have clashed many times before, including a memorable joust two years ago when she introduced a motion to censure him for saying that advocates for Hong Kong independence should be \u201ckilled mercilessly.\u201d\n\nHo is suspected of doing a lot more than talking about violence against democracy activists these days, as he was caught on camera in July shaking hands with people who appeared to be leaders of the white-shirted mob that infamously attacked protesters and bystanders at the Yuen Long railroad station.", "description": "Pro-China lawmaker Junius Ho is kicked out of a Hong Kong legislative meeting for hurling a sexist insult at female colleague Claudia Mo.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1157177157-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
