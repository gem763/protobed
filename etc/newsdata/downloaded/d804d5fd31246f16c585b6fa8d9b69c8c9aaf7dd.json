Specialist police teams armed with syringes filled with acetone to unstick them were sent to the building before they were arrested. A lorry was also parked in the middle of the road outside the Home Office with activists lying under it.\n\nAnd a new plot to shut down London City Airport for up to three days from 9am on Thursday by occupying the terminal have emerged this morning.\n\nMet Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said his officers will impose 'new conditions' using the public order act to clear the streets of Westminster.\n\nHe said: 'People can now only lawfully protest in the pedestrianised area of Trafalgar Square - off the road. Anyone else protesting in that Westminster area, linked to Extinction Rebellion, are committing an offence and will be arrested today'.\n\nThere is also growing anger after members pitched tents against the memorial for all the women who served our country in the Second World War on Whitehall.\n\nLast night a team of vegans took over London's Smithfield market, shutting out meat traders replacing their wares with fruit and vegetables - but around a mile away some protesters were pictured enjoying meals in McDonald's and Pret.\n\nHis comrade appeared to have glued her hand to the floor as activists plan to disrupt every Government department's building\n\nA protester who has glued his hand to a door as part of an Extinction Rebellion (XR) protest outside the Department for Transport in Horseferry Road, Westminster\n\nA lorry blocks Marsham Street, outside the entrance to the Home Office, another Government department targeted today\n\nProtesters lean their banners, tents and event a lilo against the memorial for all the women who served our country in the Second World War\n\nFormer Tory party treasurer Lord Andrew Fraser confronts protesters in Westminster and shakes his fist at them while wearing his dressing gown this morning\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters demonstrate at Whitehall as dawn breaks on day 2 of their two weeks of protests in London\n\nRow after row of tents line Whitehall with as XR supporters blockade all Government departments in London today\n\nA XR activist pokes her head out of her tent to speak to police in a huge camp that has been set up close to Parliament Square by the pressure group\n\nPolice attempt to remove two Extinction Rebellion environmental activists locked to the framework of a structure they had built at a site they are calling Global Food Justice' on Lambeth Bridge on Monday evening\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists queue for McDonald's in Westminster - shunning the anti-capitalist ideals of many who joined the protests\n\nExtinction Rebellion posted this graphic online showing where their intended targets would be and where their various groups would gather\n\nThe climate change activists, many of whom camped close to Big Ben, are blockading government buildings and demanding what the plans are for the climate emergency\n\nProtesters brought chaos for commuters on Monday, closing down a large area of central London as part of coordinated actions taking place around the world.\n\nMore road closures are expected today as tens of thousands descend on the capital. Parliament Street, Great Smith Street, and Westminster and Lambeth bridges are expected to be heavily affected.\n\nThe Met Police said it had arrested 319 demonstrators by midnight last night, almost three times the 122 arrests made on the first day of similar protests last April.\n\nEco-activists who left London in chaos were branded 'crusties' and 'importunate nose-ringed climate change protesters' by Boris Johnson last night.\n\nThe Prime Minister told Extinction Rebellion demonstrators to 'stop blocking the traffic' as the city centre ground to a halt despite a massive police presence.\n\nOfficers arrested 280 protesters who closed bridges and major roads on the first day of a fortnight of action in London.\n\nAmong activists in Trafalgar Square were celebrities including model Daisy Lowe, comedian Ruby Wax and actors Juliet Stevenson and Mark Rylance.\n\nBut residents, commuters, hospital patients and paramedics reacted with fury at the protests, which brought the capital to a standstill for the second time this year.\n\nDemonstrators set up roadblocks on Westminster and Lambeth Bridges, Victoria Street, Whitehall, Horse Guards Road and The Mall. Scotland Yard vowed to take a tougher line after being accused of surrendering the streets to them for more than a week during demonstrations in April.\n\nBut despite the arrests, police failed to move them all and restore order. Those affected up by the protest included the Prime Minister, who spoke at Banqueting House on Whitehall during the launch of the third volume of an official biography of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nClimate change protest group Extinction Rebellion project an image onto the facade of UK's Houses of Parliament\n\nExtinction Rebellion environmental activists camp overnight at a site they are calling Beyond Politics outside Downing Street along Whitehall\n\nUnhappy meat traders have been locked out of Smithfield Market where vegans held a candle-lit vigil for all dead animals and put out fruit and veg on the stalls\n\nTwo women appear to enjoy a glass of wine and a meal of tomatoes and peppers this morning after occupying Smithfield Market, which is a sea of tents and fruit and veg today\n\nThe Red Brigade of The Invisible Circus surround police in Westminster yesterday on the first day of XR chaos in London\n\nExtinction Rebellion protesters remove a structure from Lambeth Bridge on Monday evening ahead of further protests this week\n\nProtesters hold hands and sing while blocking the road at Millbank in Westminster on Monday evening ahead of further protests this week\n\nAttacking 'the denizens of the heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs that now litter Trafalgar Square and Hyde Park Corner', he said the former prime minister was a 'true feminist green revolutionary' who took greenhouse gases 'seriously long before Greta Thunberg'.\n\nPatients and staff at St Thomas' Hospital were stranded, with ambulances struggling to get in or out. One paramedic at the hospital on the south side of Westminster Bridge said the protests caused 'a lot of disruption' and delayed ambulance journeys by up to 15 minutes. The gridlock left one cancer patient stuck outside the hospital for more than an hour because a taxi couldn't get to her.\n\nVeronica Smith, 55, who has lung cancer, attended an appointment at midday to drain her lungs. The care worker from Lewisham, south London, was discharged at 1.45pm but was still stranded at 3pm.\n\nAnother patient, who gave his name as Tony, 66, criticised the activists as he hobbled on a broken foot through the protest to attend an appointment.\n\nHe said: 'My bus should have been stopping outside the hospital. They should be all arrested and water-cannoned. It is absolutely disgraceful. Why do they have to disrupt people's lives?' Meanwhile, delivery driver Shah Kamal, 22, from south London, said he had to abandon his vehicle for more than two hours after being caught up in blockades.\n\nHe fears he may not get paid after failing to complete his deliveries.\n\nHaving started work at 5am, he was still unable to drive over Lambeth Bridge almost 12 hours later. He said: 'I don't think I'm getting home tonight. It is just ridiculous.'\n\nPolice taking control on Lambeth Bridge on Monday evening and confiscating camping gear and cooking equipment\n\nPolice officers in Trafalgar Square use angle grinders and de-bonder to release to Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists who locked and glued themselves together\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists continue to block the road at Trafalgar Square holding a banner saying 'You're burning out future'\n\nSome London activists glued themselves to scaffolding, and one parked a hearse in Trafalgar Square and locked himself to the steering wheel. They also shut down Smithfield meat market in east London. Mark Rylance gave a speech in which he revealed that his decision to resign from the Royal Shakespeare Company over its sponsorship contract with BP was inspired by teenage activist Greta Thunberg. Addressing a crowd off The Mall, he said: 'The collapse of society is certain.'\n\nActress Juliet Stevenson said: 'All over the world, millions and millions of people's lives are already feeling the impact and livelihoods are being destroyed.' The protesters staged a wedding, did yoga and set up camps with tents during the demonstration to curb global warming.\n\nThey also played cricket outside the Supreme Court, while 'lady vicars' occupying the south side of Lambeth Bridge sang hymns.\n\nExtinction Rebellion claims the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which brought major disruption to London and saw more than 1,100 arrests.\n\nIt cost Scotland Yard \u00a316million to police the earlier demonstrations \u2013 enough to pay the salaries of 600 bobbies.\n\nYesterday, Downing Street said protesters who 'significantly disrupt the lives of others' should feel the 'full force of the law'. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'It is essential that people can continue to go about their business. The right to peaceful protest does not extend to unlawful activity.\n\n'The Government expects police to take a firm stance against protesters who significantly disrupt the lives of others and to use the full force of the law.'\n\nThe driver of a hearse, who has attached himself to the steering wheel using a bicycle lock, is pictured as his vehicle is used to block the road at the junction of Whitehall and Trafalgar Square during the Extinction Rebellion protest in London\n\nHowever, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell backed the activists, tweeting: 'Solidarity #ExtinctionRebellion.'\n\nResponding to a video of a protester resisting arrest, National Crime Agency chief Lynne Owens tweeted that Met Police officers 'should not have to endure this sort of behaviour'. She added: 'No cause can justify the assaulting of another human being.'\n\nThe protest is part of an 'international rebellion' taking place in cities including Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said in a statement: 'As dawn broke , many thousands of people from around the world entered a new phase of rebellion against planetary inaction. Groups across 60 cities began blocking roads, bridges and transport links with the intention of remaining until our voices are heard.'\n\nAs evening descended on the capital, activists could still be seen on Westminster Bridge holding a large banner saying 'This is Change.'\n\nAnd close to Westminster Abbey more tents were pitched up as protesters could be seen playing music and dancing after the first day of protests drew to a close.\n\nIn response to claims the police have been outnumbered by protesters, a spokesman for the Met said: 'The Met has taken a robust stance in policing this protest with over 270 arrests made so far and the seizure of equipment that prevents sustained and unlawful protest and will continue to arrest.\n\n'We have a proportionate policing plan in place and relevant resources to deal with any incidents that may arise, however, whilst we have a significant number of officers policing the protests, we also have to ensure that enough officers remain on their boroughs to continue to carry out day-to-day policing and protect the wider community.'\n\nYesterday was the first day of a planned fortnight of disruption by Extinction Rebellion, bringing chaos to London as they shut down key routes in the city.\n\nProtesters were joined by eco-luvvies Daisy Lowe, Mark Rylance, Ruby Wax and Juliet Stevenson in Trafalgar Square as they shut down the landmark.\n\nFor the next two weeks XR - which has posted details and maps of its planned disruptions in advance - intends to cripple the capital with 276 protesters arrested already since the protests began.\n\nOne senior member warned ahead of the protests that if police shut them down: 'We have other plans that are more disruptive'.\n\nCommuters vented their fury about long delays and miles of queues as they criticised the XR 'hypocrites' causing more pollution by forcing cars to sit idling, while others blasted the 'nuisances' who had ruined their journeys.\n\nStreets around Westminster were packed with police threatening to arrest anyone blocking roads - but witnesses said they were being swamped because of the number of eco-zealots gathering on streets and bridges.\n\nAsked why officers did not block protesters from getting onto the bridge, the Met said: 'We do not have the power to stop every person crossing a bridge. Those who have been found to be breaking the law have been dealt with robustly.'\n\nOne group locked themselves inside a car parked in the middle of Whitehall close to Downing Street and the Cenotaph - others chained themselves by the arms and head to a hearse parked in Trafalgar Square and glued themselves to scaffolding poles.\n\nIt has become common for the detained protesters to be carried by police, because they try to cause maximum disruption by refusing to walk to the van - meaning it can take up to six officers for each arrest.\n\nActor Mark Rylance joined Extinction Rebellion protesters in The Mall where supporters of the environmental group invaded during the Changing of the Guard\n\nExtinction Rebellion activists marking the 'opening ceremony' of their protest in Trafalgar Square were joined by Ruby Wax, Juliet Stevenson and Daisy Lowe (left to right)\n\nAn Extinction Rebellion couple getting married at an action site that is being called 'The Beacon' on Westminster Bridge\n\nMailOnline has asked the Metropolitan Police for comment about their handling of the protests.\n\nOn one end of Lambeth Bridge protesters started to build a house before climbing on top when police tried to dismantle it while Smithfield Market, London's largest meat market, was 'occupied' by 500 people starting with a minute's silence for the dead animals there and around the world.\n\nDescribing the scene close to Westminster Abbey, one onlooker told MailOnline: 'Half of them are smoking weed, have cheap fold up tents that will just get binned and there is a bunch sitting in Pret'. Others wearing XR badges and carrying XR flags were seen getting lunch in McDonald's on Whitehall.\n\nDaisy Lowe (second left) posed next to Big Ben with friends including actress Jaime Winstone (far right), popstar Eliza Caird, best known as Eliza Doolittle (centre right), and TV producer Emily Ann Sonnet (far left)\n\nTV stars were at the environmental group's 'opening ceremony' under Nelson's Column as thousands closed major bridges, blocked numerous roads and even invaded The Mall during the Changing of the Guard where Rylance helped carry a giant banner saying: 'extinction or rebellion'.\n\nLowe posed next to Big Ben with friends including actress Jaime Winstone, popstar Eliza Caird, best known as Eliza Doolittle, and TV producer Emily Ann Sonnet who said: 'Life is already extinct. It's just a matter of saving what life we have left'.\n\nMinisters are understood to be looking at whether protesters who damage parts of London can be held financially responsible. In an Extinction Rebellion stunt last week, fake blood was sprayed over the Treasury \u2013 although much of it ended up going back over the demonstrators themselves.\n\nOne government source suggested a mechanism could be bringing a civil action to hurt demonstrators 'in their wallets'. 'There is discussion about whether we can ensure they are bearing the cost,' the source said. 'Democratic protests is one thing, but you cannot wreck listed buildings.'\n\nHowever, actress Juliet Stevenson called the protests 'wonderful', adding: 'We can't any longer allow governments to do this so we have to make it clear that there is no more time.\n\n'There's a long tradition in this country of people saying governments are not acting, we have to make them realise how urgent this is.'\n\nShe told MailOnline that said she had been swayed to join the protests as she wanted a future for the planet and her four children. She said she felt a duty to do what she could to help stop environmental damage and climate change.\n\nStevenson said: 'My children are saying they are not sure they want to have children when the planet is in such danger. I have a one-year-old grandchild too and I want to help ensure all of their futures.' We have 12 years before the planet is irreversibly damaged. The scientists have warned about it.'\n\nA climate change activist looks unperturbed and relaxed as six police officers carry him away from Trafalgar Square\n\nMs Stevenson, 62, star of the film 'Truly, Madly, Deeply' praised the young activists who had decided to act and blamed herself and much of her own generation for not acting before.\n\n'I was in Parliament and saw a plaque in honour of the suffragettes. In 100 years time these young people will be heroes too for what they are doing today.'\n\nTory MP Mark Pritchard said: 'Climate change needs to be tackled, the government is committed to net zero emissions by 2050, a huge step forward.\n\n'But what are ambulances carrying critical patients supposed to do with roads blocked, bridges occupied & displaced gridlock all over central London?'\n\nAnd Former Labour MP Ian Austin said: 'Not content with preventing ordinary Londoners from getting to work on buses - including people on zero hours contracts who will lose pay - the Extinction Rebelion protesters are blocking the bike lane on Lambeth Bridge and standing in the one on Westminster Bridge.'\n\nActivists say the protests could be five times bigger than those in April, which saw more than 1,100 arrests. They are part of an 'international rebellion', with action also taking place in Berlin, Madrid, Amsterdam and New York.\n\nParliament Square was empty of traffic except for police vans and bicycles as helicopters circled overhead, while on Lambeth Bridge protesters started to build a house before climbing on top when police tried to dismantle it.\n\nExtinction Rebellion vegans shouting 'beef equals grief' force out Smithfield Market meat traders (as fellow activists queue for refreshments at McDonald's and Pret)\n\nExtinction Rebellion vegans have sparked fury by forcing out meat traders from London's famous Smithfield Market and covering their stalls with fruit and veg.\n\nActivists from 'Animal Rebellion', an extreme vegan offshoot of the main environmental movement, occupied the iconic east London meat market yesterday evening.\n\nStaging a 'people's assembly' with speakers including TV presenter and animal lover Chris Packham, they demanded the Government oust all meat traders from the market and make it exclusively for fruit and veg sellers.\n\nDozens camped out overnight waiting for traders to arrive for work in the early hours - only to stop them setting up their stalls and covering them with plant-based food instead.\n\nThe protest sparked fury among workers and meat-lovers alike, as many claimed it is 'interfering with people's livelihoods'.\n\nCampaigners were also queued of hypocrisy when Extinction Rebellion 'rebels' were pictured queuing up for snacks at McDonald's and Pret A Manger.\n\nAs the sun rose in London this morning Animal Rebellion activists awoke from their tents to occupy fruit and veg stalls at Smithfield Meat Market\n\nWhile Animal Rebellion activists demanded the meat market is turned into a 'plant-based emporium' their fellow protestors queued up for snacks at McDonald's (pictured)\n\nExtinction Rebellion vegans have sparked fury by forcing out meat traders (pictured in white) from London's famous Smithfield Market, setting up tents overnight and covering their stalls with fruit and veg\n\nSome activists were seen dining on fruit and vegetables and drinking glasses of wine as regular Smithfield workers turned up\n\nDozens of protestors from 'Animal Rebellion', an extreme vegan branch of Extinction Rebellion, camped out overnight waiting for traders to arrive for work in the early hours - only to stop them setting up their stalls and covering them with fruit and veg\n\nMartin Daubney MEP branded the plan to transform Smithfield into a 'plant-based emporium' as 'abject nonsense'\n\nStaging a 'people's assembly' with speakers including TV presenter and animal lover Chris Packham (pictured), they demanded the Government oust all meat traders from the market and make it exclusively for fruit and veg sellers\n\nSmithfield is the biggest meat market in the UK and is usually open from 2am until 8am to supply London's restaurants, cafes and hotels with the best cuts on offer.\n\nMartin Daubney MEP branded the plan to transform Smithfield into a 'plant-based emporium' as 'abject nonsense'.\n\nHe tweeted: 'Just been diverted around Smithfield Market which is about to be blockaded by #animalrebellion.\n\n'A numpty on the radio says they want to make it a ''plant-based emporium'' this week. Sending solidarity to all workers in this iconic market.'\n\nDr Chris Newton asked what the police were doing to stop the sit-in, describing demonstrators as 'rich, spoilt brats'.\n\nOthers joked it was a bad idea to anger meat traders equipped with meat cleavers in the early hours of the morning.\n\nOne person tweeted: 'Winding up people with knives and meat cleavers at four in the morning is never a good idea.'\n\nMorning breaks over Smithfield Market, one of London's busiest Meat suppliers, as an Extinction Rebellion offshoot Animal Rebellion wake up after a night occupying the space which is usually open from 2am to supply London's wholesale food industries\n\nCity of London police officers are pictured surveying the fruit and veg stalls set up by Animal Rebellion as meat traders look on\n\nA sign that reads 'Super tasty multi-award winning veggies' advertising a plant-based catering service is pictured at Smithfield this morning\n\nAnother said: 'Good luck with that! The market boys and girls won't put up with your nonsense I doubt!'\n\nMany others pointed out there is already a wholesale fruit, veg and flower market down the road at New Covent Garden Market.\n\nBut the fury continued elsewhere, with one person posting: 'What bloody right has @ExtinctionR telling me or any of the hard working people at Smithfield Market what we can and cannot eat.\n\n'You're interfering where I can travel, interfering with people's day to day lives. You've no right whatsoever, so crawl back under your rocks.'\n\nDespite the criticism, Animal Rebellion stood firm, staging a candlelit vigil overnight 'in memory of all the animals who lost their lives'.\n\nThey tweeted: 'As the Smithfield workers arrive, we want them to know that no-one should have to dismember animal bodies as part of an environment-ravaging system. We want to bring them with us on a journey of change.'\n\nSome were seen dining on fruit and vegetables and drinking glasses of wine as regular Smithfield workers turned up.\n\nUnable to access their stall plots they were pictured standing on the edges of the market staring at the mayhem.\n\nEarly morning traders at Smithfield Market in east London were met with messages such as: 'Is it okay to eat animals' daubed on the floor in chalk by Animal Rebellion activists\n\nThe protest sparked fury among workers and meat-lovers alike, as many claimed it is 'interfering with people's livelihoods'\n\nThe future is fruitilicious: Meat traders at Smithfield arrived at work this morning unable to set up their stalls as they were covered in fruit and vegetables\n\nSigns are pictured on the entrance gates to Smithfield Market in east London demanding an end to animal farming and fishing.
