Weston Newsanger, of Pennsylvania, was treated at Penn State Children\u2019s Hospital for rhabdomyosarcoma after his diagnosis in 2016.\n\nThe cancer is a tumor that arises in the soft tissue, such as the muscles, and can occur throughout childhood or even be present at birth, according to St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. It accounts for about 7 to 8 percent of all childhood cancers, with about two-thirds of pediatric patients receiving their diagnosis before age 10.\n\nCHEERLEADER SAVES CHOKING TODDLER DURING HOMECOMING PARADE\n\nTreatment usually requires surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. More than 70 percent of children diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma that has not spread have long-term survival, according to St. Jude.\n\nNow marking two-years cancer-free, the boy decided to do something special for his Sept. 26 birthday.\n\n\u201cI want to get Play-Doh and dinosaurs for the children of the hospital,\u201d he told his mom, according to WHP.\n\nAnd so, Weston\u2019s wish was born and over several weeks his family collected over 1,200 containers of Play-Doh, over 1,000 dinosaurs and hundreds of other toys for the children.\n\nWeston\u2019s mother, Amy, had been keeping supporters updated on Facebook. On Aug. 22, she wrote about how Weston got excited when he saw gifts for kids waiting in the mail.\n\nCHEMICAL BURNS FROM VAPING? LUNG DAMAGE RESEMBLES MUSTARD GAS EXPOSURE, MAYO CLINIC DOCTORS SAY\n\n\u201cWeston is so excited when he gets a package to add to his pile,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSo far we have 134 packs of Play-Doh, 2 monster trucks, over 60 dinosaurs and 1 Spiderman. We have also been given monetary donations for him to go pick things out for the hospital. Plys my cousin is collecting items in Hershey and has a pile of things in addition to what we have here.\n\n\u201cIf you missed what is going on here\u2019s an update\u2026Weston decided on his own that he didn\u2019t want anything for his birthday (Sept. 26th) instead he wanted people to donate Play-Doh and dinosaurs to him to take to Hershey hospital to give to the children.
