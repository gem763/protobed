While officials from allied nations welcomed Kramp-Karrenbauer's apparent desire for Berlin to play a more prominent role in the Syrian crisis and international security affairs, they also noted the plan appeared to be far from fully formed.\n\nAmong the questions left unanswered by Kramp-Karrenbauer's plan was whether the United Nations would grant a mandate for a force to patrol such a safety zone, whether Germany itself would participate and which other countries might contribute troops. The prospects of a U.N. mandate appear slim, the chances of the coalition government in Berlin agreeing to deploy soldiers look equally remote, and allies have not stepped up to suggest they would be willing to pitch in.\n\nEven German officials admit Russia would likely veto any U.N. resolution to establish such a security zone as it has little interest in having other troops in Syria, where it now holds considerable sway, having allied with the Syrian regime.\n\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told reporters Thursday she wanted to find \"a joint solution\" at NATO and spoke of \"an open process that has to continue step-by-step.\"\n\nGermany's allies tried to be polite in public about the proposal from Kramp-Karrenbauer, who took over from Angela Merkel last year as leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Union and is a leading candidate to take over as chancellor. But their remarks left little room for doubt that the plan was a non-starter.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Friday that the German plan \"deserves consideration\" but \"it's not something the United States intends to participate in with regard to ground troops.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, ever the diplomat, tried to put a positive spin on things. \"I welcome that NATO allies have ideas, proposals on how we can try to address a very difficult situation in northern Syria,\" he told a news conference on Thursday.\n\nBut he also spoke of an \"a frank and open discussion\" on Syria and \"different views among allies.\" As NATO operates on consensus, those different views mean the alliance is unlikely to be able to do much about the Syrian crisis.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer told reporters Thursday she wanted to find \"a joint solution\" at NATO and spoke of \"an open process that has to continue step-by-step.\" Yet she also admitted that \"this won\u2019t be a process that advances swiftly, that\u2019s becoming clear.\"\n\nRecent events in Syria have presented NATO with major challenges. Its leading member, the United States, suddenly ordered the withdrawal of troops from parts of northeastern Syria \u2014 allowing another NATO member, Turkey, to mount a military incursion against Syrian Kurdish fighters who had been Washington's allies in the fight against the Islamic State group. Turkey's offensive sparked condemnation from many other NATO allies and the European Union.\n\nEuropean officials fear the chaos in the region will allow the Islamic State to regroup and pose a greater terrorist threat across the Continent.\n\nAllies have also expressed discontent over the recent Sochi agreement between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which Turkey agreed to halt its offensive in return for the withdrawal of Kurdish forces to 30 km south of the Turkish border. Turkey and Russia also decided conduct joint patrols in the border area.\n\nA French diplomatic official said German assertions that Paris supported Kramp-Karrenbauer's proposal were \"wrong,\" but added that France \"finds the idea interesting because France and Germany are coming to the same conclusion: The Turkish offensive is endangering European security interests by creating the conditions for the resurgence of ISIS.\"\n\nThe proposal risked drawing attention to the parlous state of Germany's own armed forces.\n\nThe official said that \"the idea is not developed enough yet, including internally in Berlin, but [it is] the kind of German stepping-up that everyone is waiting for, instead of increasing their contribution to the budget of the NATO bureaucracy to try to please Donald Trump, which will have no impact on burden sharing in the real world.\"\n\nAnalysts and Kramp-Karrenbauer's political rivals at home have been more blunt in expressing criticism about the holes in the minister's plan.\n\n\"Apparently the proposal is her private initiative. No details concerning the size of the protection zone, number of troops etc.,\" German Green MP Tobias Lindner said this week after a briefing from the minister. \"Responsible foreign policy is done differently!\"\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer also faced attacks from her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners, who were not consulted on her plan. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD learned about it via a text message shortly before it was presented to the public.\n\nTobias Schneider, an analyst at the Global Public Policy Institute, a Berlin think tank, branded the initiative \"uninformed, ill-thought-out, untimely, practically and politically unworkable, and even if implemented, strategically dead-ended.\"\n\nMoreover, the proposal risked drawing attention to the parlous state of Germany's own armed forces, thus underlining that even if Kramp-Karrenbauer's plan proved workable, Berlin would be hard-pressed to contribute much in military terms.\n\nHowever, Wolfgang Ischinger, the chair of the Munich Security Conference \u2014 a leading annual gathering of politicians, policymakers, military officers and diplomats \u2014 said Kramp-Karrenbauer deserved some credit.\n\n\"She deserves recognition for having the courage to come up with a proposal that... would attract a lot of criticism by a rather pacifist-leaning German public,\" he said. \"[It's] something which the German government should have done a long time ago, namely make sure that the world understands that Germany has not fallen asleep when it comes to international security affairs.\"\n\nNevertheless, Ischinger criticized the way the proposal was developed.\n\n\"She should have developed this plan carefully, including some thoughts about a possible exit strategy, composition of the force, how to work with the United States, [the question of] do we need to need to engage with Russia, Turkey etc.,\" he said.\n\nRym Momtaz, Zia Weise, David M.
