After locating the pair, Squamish Search and Rescue tried to save Martin, but were unsuccessful.\n\nMikayla Martin and her father James Martin photographed in 2018 for the CBC/Petro-Canada Bond series on aspiring athletes.

Sascha Banks.\n\n\"It can't be stressed more that adventuring in Squamish comes with inherent risks,\" Banks said.\n\n\"We can only ask that you take that one more risk assessment, one more second to check the geographics, one more look at your equipment, and one more conversation about what the plan is. We all want people to live doing what they love.\"\n\nA longtime skier, Martin grew up racing alpine with the Whistler Mountain Ski Club before moving on to competitive ski-cross in 2017. She quickly made a name for herself, joining the national team the same year.\n\n\"Miki will always be remembered for her incredible smile, infectious enthusiasm, determination, work ethic and of course her role as a mentor to so many young [Whistler Mountain Ski Club] athletes,\" said club executive director Mark Tilston in a statement.\n\nMartin, right, practises for the women's ski-cross event at the freestyle ski and snowboard world championships against Sami Kennedy-Sim of Australia in Solitude, Utah, last February. (The Associated Press)\n\nSki-cross became a medal sport for the first time in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. It features four to six competitors racing downhill against each other on a course that includes jumps and banks.\n\nIn 2018, Martin became the FIS Junior World Champion in Cardrona, New Zealand. She placed sixth, a personal best, at the 2018 FIS World Cup in Innichen, Italy.\n\nMarielle Thompson, a fellow national ski-cross team member and training mate who also came out of the Whistler Mountain Ski Club, wrote in an email, \"I was shocked and completely taken off guard when I heard the news and still don't really know what to say.... I'm absolutely heartbroken for her family.\"\n\n\"We were just training at the gym [Tuesday] in Whistler,\" said Thompson, who won a gold medal in ski-cross at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. \"Mikayla was so full of energy and eager to learn. It was cool to see her make such progress last year in her first season of World Cup.\"\n\nMartin during a training jump in 2018.
