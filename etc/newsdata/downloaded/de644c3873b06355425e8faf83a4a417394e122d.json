And we have to give him the fact he has moved country, leagues and is as young as all the young \u00adplayers we are talking about.\n\n\u201cHe has just turned 21. So if anyone is getting too \u00adexcited about this, they should calm down, frankly, \u00adbecause he has \u00adalready started five games for us.\n\n\u201cWhat he needs to do is work daily, and work to show within the group that he \u00addeserves to play \u2013 as all the players do.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really pleased with Callum\u2019s response to criticism and that has to \u00adcontinue.\n\n\u201cWe can all focus on Pulisic, but Callum\u2019s the same. I have to speak in the real world when I speak to them.\u201d", "description": "Christian Pulisic joined Chelsea for \u00a358m this summer but Frank Lampard has warned him, Mason Mount and Ross Barkley that there aren't enough spots to go around", "authors": ["Tom Hopkinson", "Image", "Chelsea Fc Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Will Oliver Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20469597.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Chelsea-Pre-Season-Tour-to-Japan-Day-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
