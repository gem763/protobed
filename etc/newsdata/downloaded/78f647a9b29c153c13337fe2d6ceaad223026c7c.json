REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament chief on Thursday ruled out any Brexit deal without an Irish backstop but said the EU was willing to revive a proposal that would keep only Northern Ireland in the bloc\u2019s orbit to maintain a seamless border on the island of Ireland.\n\nThe European Parliament must endorse any Brexit deal agreed between the EU and Britain for it to take effect. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says his country will leave the EU on Oct.31, deal or no deal.\n\nThe backstop, the key obstacle to a deal, aims to ensure no customs or regulatory controls are imposed on the border between the British-ruled Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland after Brexit. Johnson opposes the backstop, fearing it will trap Britain in a permanent customs union with the EU or else split Northern Ireland from the rest of Britain.\n\n\u201cWe want an agreement but we are aware that an agreement without a backstop wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d the new head of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, told a news conference. \u201cThere can\u2019t be an agreement without a backstop. There won\u2019t be one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to stress this point: the United Kingdom hasn\u2019t provided any alternatives ... anything that has been workable,\u201d said Sassoli, who hails from Italy\u2019s centre-left Democratic Party.\n\nSassoli said any departure without a deal would only ever be Britain\u2019s choice and that the bloc was ready to analyse any concrete proposals from London on replacing the backstop.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to go back to the original EU proposal which is that a backstop will only be added for Northern Ireland.\u201d\n\nHe spoke a day after Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiator visited Brussels for a third round of talks with the executive European Commission in two weeks.\n\nMore than three years since Britons voted out and with just seven weeks to go, the British government and parliament are locked in conflict over Brexit, with possible outcomes ranging from leaving without a deal to holding another referendum.", "description": "The European Parliament chief on Thursday ruled out any Brexit deal without an Irish backstop but said the EU was willing to revive a proposal that would keep only Northern Ireland in the bloc's orbit to maintain a seamless border on the island of Ireland.", "authors": ["Philip Blenkinsop", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429036774&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B0S8", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
