But it has passed a law saying that UK tourists can still get healthcare as before, for now, if they show their passport.\n\nThere is a similar agreement with Ireland, too.\n\nBut that leaves 28 countries.\n\nIf British people need medical help in any of them, after a no-deal Brexit, they will either need to pay or rely on travel insurance.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe government says it is still trying to sort more healthcare deals.\n\nBut a spokesperson points out it \"always advises UK citizens to take out comprehensive travel insurance when going overseas, both to EU and non-EU destinations. This remains our advice\".\n\nThe Association of British Insurers says that if EHICs largely disappear in a no-deal Brexit \"insurers will inevitably see an increase in claims costs - this could have a direct impact on the prices charged to consumers\".\n\nAxa Insurance's travel director, Nel Mooy, agrees: \"If nothing changes between now and 31 October and there was no deal, then I'm expecting prices to go up.\"\n\nShe says there are \"too many unknowns\" to predict how much prices could go up by but points out that travel insurance generally is not all that expensive.\n\nShe adds: \"People who are not well at all already have a higher premium and therefore anything extra, I can totally appreciate that anything more, might be more difficult for them to afford.\"\n\nThis tallies with the government's own analysis of a reasonable worst case scenario for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe Operation Yellowhammer document says that people could need to pay for treatment in the EU and a minority of patients \"could face substantial costs.\"\n\nHealth experts warn that even if there is a Brexit deal, EHIC may not continue after a transition period.\n\nMark Dayan, from the Nuffield Trust, says he is not \"optimistic\".\n\nHe explains: \"EHIC is connected to the part of EU law that deals with free movement of people.\n\n\"The European Union doesn't like the idea of us cherry picking only the bits we like.\"\n\nAdvice for travel insurance after a no-deal Brexit\n\n\u2022If you have a long-term health problem, try to find travel insurance before you book\n\n\u2022See if your bank account gives you travel insurance for free\n\n\u2022You might need to shop around with specialist providers\n\n\u2022Give insurers as much information as possible about where you are going to\n\n\u2022Annual policies could work out more expensive than shorter cover\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "The scheme works in 31 countries but only three have agreed to cover UK tourists if there is no deal.", "authors": ["Catherine Burns", "Newsbeat Reporter"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A16F/production/_109172314_michaela.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
