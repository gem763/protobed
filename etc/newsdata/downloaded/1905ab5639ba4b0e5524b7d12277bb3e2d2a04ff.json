In 6 states, they might owe you money", "language": "en", "text": "After a North Carolina man was awarded a $750,000 judgment against his ex-wife\u2019s lover, the \u201calienation of affections\u201d law is back under the spotlight.\n\nKevin Howard, of Greenville, brought an \u201calienation of affections\u201d claim against a man who was having an affair with his then-wife. In August, a judge ruled in Howard\u2019s favor.\n\nThe law allows individuals to sue others for ruining their marriages. While most states got rid of it years ago, it's still on the books in Hawaii, Mississippi, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Dakota and Utah.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, quite frankly, think it is antiquated and should be abolished,\u201d Cynthia Mills, a lawyer who represented Howard, as well as dozens of other plaintiffs under the claim, told ABC News on Thursday.\n\nThe concept of \"alienation of affections\" comes from old English law when women were considered property and \u201ca man could sue another man for stealing his wife, like when he could sue a man for stealing his horse.\u201d\n\nThe law has since evolved, such that women can now sue.\n\n\u201c \u201d A man could sue another man for stealing his wife, like when he could sue a man for stealing his horse\n\nThe basic element, Mills said, is that two people had a happy marriage until \u201ca third party came in and basically seduced the other spouse to leave the marriage and the family.\u201d Sex is not a legal requirement to make the claim.\n\nShe noted that the North Carolina law recognizes that all marriages have their ups and downs, but that the marriages could have sustained such tumult \"until this third party comes.\u201d\n\nTetra Images/Getty Image, FILE\n\nHoward might have been awarded a hefty sum of money, but it\u2019s far from the highest price paid out.\n\nA woman in North Carolina won $9 million in a 2010 lawsuit against a woman she said was involved with her husband of 33 years.\n\nA big payday, however, is not always the driving force, according to Mills.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re concerned about making a statement about the morality of the issue,\u201d she said.\n\nShe is currently working with five separate aggrieved spouses, and she guesses that in her 31 years as a lawyer, she has handled 30 such cases. The largest sum a plaintiff she represented received was $5.9 million.\n\nShe said that while there have been attempts to repeal the law, including constitutional challenges, it remains \u201cvery prevalent\" in North Carolina.", "description": "A North Carolina man was awarded $750,000 under the", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/gavel-gty-jt-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
