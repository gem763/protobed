The government is currently only on track to meet one of them.\u201d\n\nJET is the world\u2019s largest fusion reactor and earlier this year secured \u00a392.1m in EU finding that will secure its future until 2020.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

For it to be commercially viable, the process would need to produce more energy than it consumes, which is yet to happen.\n\nIf the technology is ready before 2050 it is already too late for the 1.5C target. The net-zero 2050 target assumes emissions decrease from now until 2050.\n\nGreenpeace and Friends of the Earth have previously criticised the PM for wasting money on the \u201cpipe dream\u201d of nuclear fusion.\n\n\u201cEven if we could snap our fingers on December 31, 2049 and replace all fossil fuel plants, the world would have already emitted twice as much carbon as the budget allows,\u201d said Mr Nicholas.\n\n\u201cSound climate policy involves cutting emissions as soon as possible, and any further delay makes the task even harder.\u201d\n\nCraig Bennett, Friends of the Earth chief executive, said: \u201cWhy throw money away on tech-fix pipe dreams, at precisely the moment that onshore and offshore wind and solar are delivering better returns than ever before?\n\n\u201cIf the government is serious about slashing climate pollution it needs to stop fracking, stop filling the skies with more planes and stop funding oil and gas projects abroad, and instead invest in public transport and renewable energy.\u201d", "description": "Scientists have attacked\u00a0Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that an Oxfordshire facility is \u201con the verge\u201d\u00a0of creating commercially viable fusion reactors, saying the technology\u00a0is decades away, and poses a distraction from the government\u2019s failure to cut emissions.\u00a0 In the prime minister\u2019s Conservative party conference speech he referred to a fusion reactor called the\u00a0Joint European Torus", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/12/boris-speech-6.jpg"}
