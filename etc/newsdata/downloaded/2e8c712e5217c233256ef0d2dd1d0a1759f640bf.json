Divers had to hold off their search in the water on Wednesday night, due to unfavourable weather conditions.\n\nA broken windscreen of a Volkswagen vehicle, a shoe and other clothing were seen floating just below Vo\u00eblklip in the sea.\n\nTimesLive reported that the couple owns the Herolds Bay Caf\u00e9 and runs the Garden Route Property Management group, which manages several holiday homes in the area.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A massive search is on for Southern Cape mum Heidi Scheepers and her two children who vanished after they were last seen in Herolds Bay, near George.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9514/a7bd2cb3b3a14164a17dd84d13e3a2d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
