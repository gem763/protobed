The whole thing was caught on TV when the game aired, and according to TMZ, the game was briefly held up while security apprehended the women and escorted them out of the stadium. The duo were also reportedly taken to police headquarters before being released.\n\nThe two women have been identified as Julia Rose and Lauren Summer, and it's been reported that the stunt was to raise awareness for breast cancer\u2014although some believe that they meant to promote SHAGMAG, the publication that they both work for.\n\n\"Julia Rose, founder and CEO of SHAGMAG, pushed for the stunt to create awareness on breast cancer,\" SHAGMAG co-founder Stephen McHugh said in an email. \"Julia\u2019s company, SHAGMAG, is the millennial version of PLAYBOY.\"\n\nWhatever their intentions were, the flashing has now resulted in a lifetime ban from MLB events.
