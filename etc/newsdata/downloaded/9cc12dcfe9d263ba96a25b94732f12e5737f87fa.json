In addition to banning for-profit charter schools (which make up about 15 percent of the sector), she would subject existing charters to more scrutiny and red tape and make it harder for new charters to open by ending federal start-up funding and allowing only local school districts to authorize charter schools. Other parts of the union-pleasing plan: an end to rigorous testing for all children to measure whether they are in fact learning.\n\nThe attack on charter schools is particularly disappointing given Ms. Warren\u2019s past support for charters in her home state, which has some of the nation\u2019s best charters. She once touted the \u201cextraordinary results\u201d of many Massachusetts charters and spoke of the need to \u201ccelebrate the hard work of those teachers and spread what\u2019s working to other schools.\u201d The federal program she wants to end helped to start some charters in Boston that have shown good results in educating low-income and minority students.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s change of heart (which started in 2016, when she opposed a referendum that would have lifted caps on charter schools in Massachusetts), along with the silence of other Democrats who once championed charter schools (New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former vice president Joe Biden come to mind), is no mystery. The teachers unions wield outsize influence in the Democratic Party, and they revile the mostly non-unionized charter sector. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), another presidential candidate, unveiled a proposal similar to Ms. Warren\u2019s in May.\n\nThe losers in these political calculations are the children whom charters help. Charters at their best offer options to parents whose children would have been consigned to failing traditional schools. They spur reform in public school systems in such places as the District and Chicago. And high-quality charters lift the achievement of students of color, children from low-income families and English language learners. Research from Stanford University\u2019s Center for Research on Education Outcomes found, for example, that African American students in charter schools gained an additional 59 days of learning in math and 44 days in reading per year compared with their traditional school counterparts.\n\nMore than 3.2 million children already attend charter schools, and 5 million more would choose a charter school if one could open near them. No question there are bad charters; unlike bad traditional schools, they are shut down if they don\u2019t improve in jurisdictions that set rigorous standards in authorizing and overseeing charters. That Ms. Warren would go after charters while letting traditional schools off the hook even more by lessening accountability is a plan for serving adult interests and not student needs.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The presidential candidate\u2019s education policy puts adults before children.", "authors": ["Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D0IMBBYwx8OK_IVvwkFJcPAnLmg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/25HW6KHZZII6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
