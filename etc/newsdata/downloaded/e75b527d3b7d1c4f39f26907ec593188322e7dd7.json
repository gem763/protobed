Pierre Delecto is Mitt Romney. The ultra-wealthy Mormon senator, recently rumored to be testing the waters for yet another presidential run, admitted he was behind the nom de tweet on Sunday after telling an Atlantic reporter he had a secret account \u2013 \u201cWhat do they call me, a lurker?\u201d \u2013 created to monitor political conversation.\n\nMitt Romney and New Gingrich don't like each other. That is not news. Romney once called him a \"failed leader\" who \"resigned in disgrace.\" #PierreDelecto also does not care for Newt Gingrich, as demonstrated by his like of this tweet. 3/ pic.twitter.com/B8oCtzjA9j \u2014 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) October 20, 2019\n\n\u201cPierre\u201d mostly expressed himself through \u201clikes\u201d of other posts \u2013 he was a big fan of anything critical of Trump, especially the president\u2019s Syria policy. He regularly \u201cliked\u201d Mitt Romney\u2019s posts. When confronted with his alter ego \u2013 he had given enough clues for another reporter to track him down, apparently wanting to be caught \u2013 he responded \u201cC\u2019est moi,\u201d and set @qaws9876 to private.\n\nThe account dates back to 2011. It followed a slew of never-Trump Republicans and Romney family members, but rarely tweeted\u2026 except occasionally in support of Romney.\n\nTwitter had a field day with the revelation, likening the odd pseudonym to \u201cCarlos Danger,\u201d the name disgraced Congressman Anthony Weiner used to send lewd photos to underage girls.\n\nWho would win in a fight: Pierre Delecto or Carlos Danger? pic.twitter.com/pbQJrlNwtJ \u2014 \u201cspooky\u201d roderick strong fan account (@meeeeeeeeeels) October 21, 2019\n\nFan accounts were made.\n\nSo many fake Pierre Delecto accounts to choose from but this one is the best: #PierreDelectopic.twitter.com/TL3DW8DLQS \u2014 Doug Bluecher (@DougBluecher) October 21, 2019\n\nSeveral people suggested they would dress as Romney\u2019s alter ego for Halloween. But what would that look like?\n\n\ud83d\udc40WOWSERS!!\ud83d\udc40\n\n\n\nJust when you think you've seen everything...you find out #NeverTrumper Mittens has been a #Twitter#lurker since 2011!\n\n\n\nAn unassuming handle @qaws9876 but excellent stripper name ~ I never would have guessed!\n\n\n\nWell done, #PierreDelecto! \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Bti8xZtRGS \u2014 \ud83c\udf34\u0bf9_Actually\ud83c\udf34 (@G_Actually) October 21, 2019\n\nRomney claimed to be \u201copen to the idea that the president may need to be removed from the Oval Office,\u201d but has shied away from directly cheering on impeachment, at least under his real name.\n\nAlso on rt.com With Clinton & Romney both rumored to be JOINING 2020 race, has politics gone the way of Hollywood?\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
