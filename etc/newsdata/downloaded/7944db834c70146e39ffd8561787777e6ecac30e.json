Or at least that\u2019s the case with Chipotle Mexican Grill and Kentucky Fried Chicken, who both announced very different menu plans Tuesday.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nIn a press release, Chipotle introduced its brand new steak option, Carne Asada. The grilled slice beef item will roll out nationally on Sept. 19 and will treat customers to seasoned protein drizzled in squeezed lime, hand-chopped cilantro and a blend of signature spices. Chipotle\u2019s Carne Asada has been approved by the Whole30 diet program and is even compliant with paleo diets.\n\nChipotle's limited-edition Carne Asada.

In the month of Sept. alone, Taco Bell has expanded its vegetarian menu and Just Salad ditched steak for a Beyond Meat replacement; even Kellogg\u2019s has felt the push for meat-free protein staples to stay competitive.\n\nOther quick-service restaurants have joined the faux meat craze, including Del Taco\u2019s \u201cBeyond Burritos,\u201d Burger King\u2019s \u201cImpossible Whopper,\u201d White Castle\u2019s \u201cImpossible Slider\u201d and Red Robin\u2019s \u201cImpossible Burger.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg BYND BEYOND MEAT INC. 160.31 +1.34 +0.84%\n\nDespite having a successful one-day trial of Beyond Fried Chicken trial of nuggets and wings in Atlanta last month, KFC doesn\u2019t tout itself as the pinnacle of health. This fact was driven home with Tuesday's announced test run of a \u201cChicken & Donuts\u201d menu item.\n\nThe over the top offering will sandwich a slab of fried chicken between two vanilla glazed doughnuts. Customers also get to choose between a chicken bucket or tenders, and can pair their choice with one or two doughnuts, according to the report.\n\nExact figures were not released but if you are wondering what the calorie count may be. Well, two glazed donuts tally about 400 calories (depending on bakery) and a KFC fried chicken breast is posted at 320 calories, so the Colonel's latest comes in around 720 calories. By comparison Burker King's Whopper with cheese totals 740 calories.\n\nKFC\u2019s \u201cChicken & Donuts\u201d is available at more than 40 locations in Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia, as well as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a limited time.\n\nImage 1 of 2 \u25bc KFC's limited-edition \"Chicken & Donuts\" sandwich.

BRANDS 112.80 +2.26 +2.04%\n\nThe arrival of this savory and sweet menu item reaches the public after a chicken sandwich war instigated by Popeyes last month. Since then, Wall Street analysts have observed an increase in the Louisiana-inspired fried chicken joint\u2019s stock due to the sandwich\u2019s high demand and scarcity. In as little as two weeks, Popeyes sold out of its inventory completely but promised the sandwich would make a return at a later date.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg QSR RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL INC. 73.95 +2.47 +3.46%\n\nTwitter users also noticed the timeliness of KFC\u2019s doughnut chicken sandwich and how it coincides with Popeyes\u2019 recent success.\n\nUser @ASDem tweeted Popeyes directly to ask the chain about what it has done.\n\nAnother user by the name of @thesheetztweetz told Popeyes and Chick-fil-A that the next move was on them in a tweet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nOutside of the competition, one user wanted to find out what stance KFC is on in terms of health. \u201cKFC hit us with the Vegan Fried Chicken a few weeks ago now they got a Donut Chicken Sammich. Which side of the fence y\u2019all on KFC? Health or hurt,\u201d user @KINGSmitty tweeted.\n\nOther reactions on Twitter were a mix of positive and negative, and some were even in the middle with both intrigue and disgust.\n\nPrevious to the entry of the doughnut, KFC brought back \"Kentucky Fried Chicken & Waffles\" for a limited run earlier this year.", "description": "Healthy or unhealthy\u2014the fast food industry can\u2019t seem to decide.
