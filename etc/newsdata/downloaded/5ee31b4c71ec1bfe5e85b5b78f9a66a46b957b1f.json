Tigar who had initially blocked the new rule from taking effect in late July, saying \"it is inconsistent with the existing asylum laws.\" But a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed that order, ruling it only applied in California and Arizona, where the appellate court has jurisdiction.\n\nJudge Tigar sought to reimpose his nationwide ban on the asylum rule on Monday, but the 9th Circuit again intervened on Tuesday and narrowed Tigar's order.\n\nImmigrant advocates were disheartened by the high court decision. They said all of the court rulings thus far have been in preliminary proceedings and the merits of the case have not been argued in court.\n\n\"We are looking at a potentially devastating situation at the southern border,\" Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union told NPR. \"People are fleeing serious danger and now they will not be allowed to apply for asylum. This is an unfortunate setback but we have to keep fighting because the practical is enormous.\"", "description": "The administration scores a victory in its efforts to reduce the number of asylum applicants presenting themselves at the U.S. southern border.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/11/ap_19236607035722_wide-545ff84d1978e24e4884ea36d8f12b7f5b012174.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
