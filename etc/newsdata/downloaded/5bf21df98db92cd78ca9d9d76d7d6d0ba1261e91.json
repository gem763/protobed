A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman said the \u201caction is unrelated to the trade negotiations,\u201d and China confirmed Vice Premier Liu He would lead the delegation as planned.\n\nU.S. equity-index futures fell, reversing an earlier gain, while European stocks slipped to snap a two-day advance, ahead of high-level trade talks between America and China this week. U.S. futures fell after China said it strongly opposed the American decision to blacklist some of its technology firms. Equity benchmarks across Asia rose earlier as trading showed little concern about ongoing unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nThe blacklist, first reported by Reuters, still takes President Donald Trump\u2019s economic war against China in a new direction, marking the first time his administration has cited human rights as a reason for action. Past moves to blacklist companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. have been taken on national security grounds.\n\nThe companies on the blacklist include two video surveillance companies \u2014 Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co. \u2014 that by some accounts control as much as a third of the global market for video surveillance and have cameras all over the world.\n\nAlso targeted were SenseTime Group Ltd. \u2014 the world\u2019s most valuable artificial intelligence startup \u2014 and fellow AI giant Megvii Technology Ltd., which is said to be aiming to raise up to US$1 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering. Backed by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the pair are at the forefront of China\u2019s ambition to dominate AI in coming years.\n\nEntities on the list are prohibited from doing business with American companies without being granted a U.S. government licence, although some have maintained relationships with banned companies through international subsidiaries. Hikvision and Dahua were suspended from trading Tuesday, but iFlytek Co. \u2014 one of the eight singled out \u2014 slid 2.7 per cent in Shenzhen.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, these entities have been implicated in human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China\u2019s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups\u201d in Xinjiang, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a federal register notice published Monday.\n\nThe foreign ministry\u2019s Geng accused the U.S. of having \u201csinister intentions.\u201d \u201cThe measures taken by China to eliminate extremism from the roots are fully in line with Chinese law and international practice,\u201d he said.\n\nSenseTime and Dahua weren\u2019t immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours.\n\n\u201cHikvision strongly opposes today\u2019s decision by the U.S. government and it will hamper efforts by global companies to improve human rights around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cPunishing Hikvision, despite these engagements, will deter global companies from communicating with the U.S. government, hurt Hikvision\u2019s U.S. businesses partners and negatively impact the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nMegvii said the U.S. had \u201cno grounds\u201d to put it on the list, and noted that Human Rights Watch had corrected a report that implicated the company. It added that it hadn\u2019t earned revenue from Xinjiang in the first part of the year, and the impact on its business from the designation was minimal.\n\nThe blacklist comes as Trump faces growing pressure at home to support pro-democracy protests in the Chinese-controlled territory of Hong Kong. On Monday, Trump said he was hoping for a \u201chumane solution\u201d in a city where protests have grown increasingly violent.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say:\n\nWith growth fading, the U.S. and China could both use at least a reprieve from trade tensions. A mini-deal was mooted. It now looks less likely Bloomberg Economics Chief Economist Tom Orlik\n\nThe move targets Chinese surveillance companies involved in the crackdown in Xinjiang, where as many as a million Uighur Muslims have been placed in mass detention camps, prompting criticism from around the world. The White House in May had readied the sanctions package for surveillance technology companies accused of human rights violations, but decided to hold back because of the trade negotiations.\n\nIn June, the Trump administration again considered the sanctions and had planned to roll them out with a human rights speech by Vice President Mike Pence on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, Bloomberg has reported. The speech was postponed indefinitely, so that Trump could secure a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Osaka, Japan.\n\nAlso to be placed on the Commerce Department\u2019s \u201centity list\u201d are the Xinjiang region\u2019s public security bureau and 18 other municipal and county public security bureaus as well as the province\u2019s police college.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government and Department of Commerce cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in a statement on Monday. \u201cThis action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenceless minority populations.\u201d\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "News comes just days before high-level trade talks, sending stocks lower", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/hikvision.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
