The whistleblower claimed that the official transcript of Trump\u2019s 25 July call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky was placed into a highly secured system reserved for the most sensitive intelligence information.\n\nIt is unclear if records of the May 2017 meeting were filed in the same system. But only a few officials with the highest security clearances had access to a memorandum summarizing the meeting, in an attempt to keep the comments from going public, sources told the Post.\n\nTrump-Ukraine scandal: US special envoy steps down as crisis widens Read more\n\nThe 2017 White House meeting between Donald Trump and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, has long been controversial. It took place shortly after Trump fired James Comey, and Trump reportedly used the meeting to disparage the FBI director as a \u201cnut job\u201d, saying his dismissal relived \u201cgreat pressure\u201d on him. Trump was also reported to have shared Israeli intelligence related to Isis with the Russian officials.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s remarks about being unconcerned about Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 election especially troubled White House officials because they made it seem like the president forgave Russia for an attack intended to help elect him, according to the Post.\n\nWith an impeachment inquiry now under way, other reports have emerged of the White House\u2019s apparent efforts to limit access to transcripts of conversations with foreign leaders. The White House made an effort to restrict access to transcripts for phone calls with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, as well, CNN reported Friday.", "description": "White House restricted access to comments in 2017 meeting, allowing only a few officials to see transcript", "authors": ["Vivian Ho"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/754cc6f8a18e34ac8f06d466644116a4897b7d95/0_34_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3e61986f6676fbe08e4768d5fdea6878", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
