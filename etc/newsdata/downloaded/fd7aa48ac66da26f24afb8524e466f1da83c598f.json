The part helps manage the forces between the wings and the jet's body.\n\nA retired Boeing engineer told KOMO that \"it's unusual to have a crack in the pickle fork.\"\n\n\"It's not designed to crack that way at all,\" the engineer added. \"Period.\"\n\nThe FAA said Friday it will \"instruct operators to conduct specific inspections, make any necessary repairs and to report their findings to the agency immediately.\"\n\nThe cracking issue does not affect any P-8 Poseidon airplanes, Boeing said, or 737 MAX model, which is currently grounded while engineers work to correct issues with the plane's automated flight control system, the airline manufacturer added.", "description": "The FAA is instructing airlines to inspect Boeing 737 NG jetliners after Boeing told the agency it had discovered evidence of cracks in a fuselage part.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/boeing-737ng-20190928_hpMain_20190928-073624_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
