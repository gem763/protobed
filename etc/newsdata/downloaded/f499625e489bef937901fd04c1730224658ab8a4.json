She could have been two miles away; it\u2019s just she was in the room next door.\"\n\nHarry's family have stood firm on their position that they would be willing to meet Sacoolas, but only on the condition that such a meeting would be held in the UK.\n\nCharles said: \"We made it very clear that, as we\u2019ve said all along, we will meet with her and we would still love to meet with her, but it has to be on our terms and on UK soil.\"\n\nHarry Dunn, 19, was killed in a road collision in August\n\nIn a statement to journalists on Monday, a spokesperson for the family said they \"don't really see the point\" of any meeting outside of this condition.\n\nBut Sacoolas, the wife of a US diplomat who was posted to the UK, has so far shown no intention of returning of her own accord, having only released an apology \u2014 via her lawyer \u2014 seven weeks after the August incident.\n\nThe 43-year-old claimed diplomatic immunity and flew back to the US after reportedly telling British police she would cooperate with their investigation.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry's parents say they have seen CCTV footage of the moments leading up to their son's fatal collision near RAF Croughton base in Northamptonshire, and maintain that Sacoolas was driving her car on the wrong side of the road.\n\nREAD MORE: Mother of Harry Dunn says written apology from US diplomat's wife after seven weeks is 'just wrong'\n\nSpeaking about their brief meeting with Trump on Tuesday, Charles and Dunn said the US president was \"very gracious and respectful\", and said they believed he \"genuinely will look to try and resolve this\".\n\nThey added that Trump initially rejected the idea of Sacoolas returning to the UK, but later softened his stance and said he may try to \"push this from a different angle\".", "description": "The parents of Harry Dunn refused US President Donald Trump's offer to meet the woman involved in their son's fatal road crash after they found out she was sitting in an adjacent room.", "authors": ["Rachael Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/79/20/1000x563_cmsv2_aeae6413-0e13-5642-b315-fff0a271a383-4237920.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
