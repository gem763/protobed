But Thursday\u2019s debate included a quick moment that highlighted how they diverge in one key area: how political power in the United States is structured, and how those structures should change.\n\nIt came during a debate about gun control and why lawmakers have thus far failed to advance a bill on the issue. \u201cWe have a Congress that is beholden to the gun industry,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd unless we\u2019re willing to address that head-on and roll back the filibuster, we\u2019re not going to get anything done on guns. I was in the United States Senate when 54 senators said let\u2019s do background checks, let\u2019s get rid of assault weapons, and with 54 senators, it failed because of the filibuster.\u201d\n\nIn April, Warren became the first major Democratic candidate to call for the arcane procedural mechanism to be scrapped. It\u2019s a logical stance for the Massachusetts senator on two levels. Her campaign is structured around the idea that the U.S. political system needs systemic democratic reforms, and the filibuster is an archetypal example of its flaws. More to the point, the GOP\u2019s structural advantage in the Senate means that the filibuster would effectively doom any major legislation that Warren and her rivals hope to pass.\n\nSanders isn\u2019t afraid to call for major changes to American society and politics. But when it comes to filibuster reform, he\u2019s less enthusiastic for it than even some of his party\u2019s moderates. \u201cNo,\u201d Sanders replied when asked by a moderator if he supported its abolition. \u201cBut what I would support, absolutely, is passing major legislation, the gun legislation the people here are talking about\u2014Medicare for All, climate change legislation that saves the planet. I will not wait for 60 votes to make that happen, and you can do it in a variety of ways. You can do that through budget reconciliation law. You have a vice president who will, in fact, tell the Senate what is appropriate and what is not, what is in order and what is not.\u201d", "description": "Their radically different approaches to the filibuster prove that the two candidates are different sorts of radicals.", "authors": ["Matt Ford"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f43a0c2d49290db80e06f814e28b6732363dbe60.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
