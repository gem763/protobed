He had been missing since the single-engine Piper Malibu aircraft carrying him and pilot David Ibbotson crashed near the Channel Island of Guernsey on Jan. 21.\n\nThe 28-year-old Sala, who had played for French club Nantes, was traveling to join his new team, Cardiff, in Wales.\n\nBray allegedly sent a message to Ashford before his night shift, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a nice one on the table for you to watch when you\u2019re next in.\u201d\n\nBoth Bray and Ashford replayed the clip of Sala\u2019s autopsy during separate shifts before Bray took a picture of it on her mobile phone and sent it to her daughter on Facebook Messenger, leading to it being widely shared on social media, prosecutors said.\n\nBray was also accused of taking a picture of another body in the mortuary, of a man who had died in non-suspicious circumstances.\n\nForensic pathologist Doctor Basil Purdue said it had been a \u201cflagrant breach of medical confidentiality.\u201d\n\nSala\u2019s sister, Romina Sala, said in a statement that she had found out about the leak when she saw pictures of her brother\u2019s body on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI cannot believe there are people so wicked and evil who could do that,\u201d Romina Sala\u2019s statement said. \u201cI\u2019ll never erase those images from my head. My brother and mother can never forget about this.\u201d\n\nThe defendants each admitted three counts of computer misuse at the court in August. Bray also admitted to obstructing justice by deleting the photos from her phone and instructing Ashford to do the same.\n\nJudge Peter Crabtree told Bray and Ashford: \u201cYou have both abused your positions in quite an appalling way.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two people who worked for a security company have been jailed for illegally accessing footage of the autopsy of Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala, leading to it being circulated online.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
