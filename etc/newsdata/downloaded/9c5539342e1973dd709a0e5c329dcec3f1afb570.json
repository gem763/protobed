Richard Blumenthal was among the lawmakers who argued for more aggressive actions.\n\n\u201cThe fact that you\u2019re coming here without any specifics, I think, reinforces the impression that federal antitrust enforcement is an empty suit. Call it a culture of capitulation. What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech, and no immediate prospect of urgency,\u201d said Blumenthal, speaking at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust subcommittee.\n\nIn a similar vein, analysts at Height Capital Markets predicted in a note Tuesday that there will be \u201c3-5 years before any antitrust action is taken against Big Tech companies given the nascent stages of the DOJ\u2019s and FTC\u2019s investigations.\u201d\n\nIn response to Blumenthal\u2019s criticism, the FTC\u2019s Simons said: \u201cWe have the same concerns you have, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve formed the technology task force to focus on exactly these issues.\u201d Blumenthal then said: \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to you is we need more than a task force. We need action.\u201d\n\nThe lawmakers on the Senate panel asked about reports of tension between the Justice Department and FTC over antitrust turf that might end up hampering the investigations into the tech companies. Both Delrahim and Simons acknowledged there has been a recent breakdown in the two agencies\u2019 relationship.\n\nRelated: News cycle is daily reminder of Big Tech\u2019s antitrust vulnerabilities\n\nAnd see: DOJ antitrust chief warns Big Tech, noting Standard Oil parallel\n\nAs Big Tech deals with antitrust probes and other Washington scrutiny, Amazon and Facebook are on pace for record-setting levels of disclosed lobbying spending this year, as Apple and Google also report significant outlays. In this year\u2019s first half, Amazon shelled out $7.9 million, Facebook spent $7.5 million, Apple shelled out $3.7 million, and Google, $6.3 million.\n\nBeyond Washington\u2019s moves, 50 state attorneys general, led by Texas, have opened an investigation into Google\u2019s potentially monopolistic behavior.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock AMZN, +0.81% is up 21% this year, Apple AAPL, +0.36% has tacked on 40%, Facebook FB, +1.00% is higher by 43%, and Alphabet GOOG, -0.17% GOOGL, -0.14% has gained 18%.
