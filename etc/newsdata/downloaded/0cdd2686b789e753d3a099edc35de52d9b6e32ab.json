That House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) is deposing witnesses in a secure hearing room, they argue, locks out Republican input and deprives Trump of due process.\n\nThere are a variety of ways in which this complaint is obviously disingenuous, including that the impeachment process will offer an opportunity for Trump to defend himself as it moves forward, including a possible trial in the Senate. But perhaps the most disingenuous aspect of the complaint is that Republicans are actively participating in the ongoing hearings.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane reported last Wednesday that Republicans who sit on the committees leading the inquiry are as engaged as Democrats, asking as many questions as they desire. Democrats control who is called in for a deposition, and only members of those three committees can participate, but any implication that Republicans broadly are excluded from the process is inaccurate.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), perhaps Trump\u2019s most energetic defender in the House, nonetheless tried to draw attention to complaints that there was insufficient \u201ctransparency and inclusion\u201d in the process. Earlier this month, Gaetz tried to attend one of the inquiry hearings \u2014 only to be turned away because he was not a member of the relevant committees. No doubt aware of the resulting media attention, Gaetz assembled an entire cadre of Republicans to join him in storming the secure hearing room Wednesday. They marched in, plunked down and proceeded to delay the hearing by hours. (Trump was reportedly informed of the plan in advance.)\n\nAgain, though, this is a weird complaint \u2014 especially coming from the crew that joined Gaetz.\n\nThere are, as of writing, 432 voting members in the House, 197 of whom are Republicans.\n\nOf the total, there are 103 members on the Intelligence, Oversight or Foreign Affairs committees, all of whom are allowed to participate in the inquiry hearings. Forty-eight of them are Republicans.\n\nIn other words, 1 out of every 4 Republicans in the House can participate in the inquiry hearings anyway. That doesn\u2019t include Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who is also allowed to participate. It does include Rep. Greg Pence (R-Ind.), the brother of the vice president. He sits on the Foreign Affairs committee.\n\nAccording to a news release sent from Gaetz\u2019s office that was spotted by journalist Marcy Wheeler, 41 Republicans joined Gaetz\u2019s sit-in protest Wednesday. Of that group, more than a quarter \u2014 13 \u2014 were members of the three relevant committees and, therefore, allowed to attend the hearings! Those 13, in fact, make up more than a quarter of all of the Republicans allowed to attend the hearings. They also included Rep. Lee Zeldin (N.Y.), who bragged during an interview on Fox News this week that he\u2019d attended more of the hearings than Schiff.\n\nAs the graphic also makes clear, far more Democrats are unable to attend the inquiry hearings compared with Republicans. Despite that, Gaetz\u2019s event didn\u2019t include any Democrats.\n\nAgain, the goal here was only superficially a commitment to an open process. It was more immediately about trying to raise questions about process and, as a side benefit, delaying a witness\u2019s testimony.\n\nAnd probably a little bit about getting on TV.\n\nAD", "description": "More than a quarter of those who stormed the secure hearing room were allowed in anyway.", "authors": ["Philip Bump", "National Correspondent Focused Largely On The Numbers Behind Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/thw_0CTOwniSUo6yyr7s704ZbCg=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-23-2019/t_a7224a5d1cf34fd28a88c1ea144a7a3f_name_20191023_GOPbarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
