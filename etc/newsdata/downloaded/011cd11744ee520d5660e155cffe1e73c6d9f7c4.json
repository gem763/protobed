Kavanaugh in response to a New York Times piece that said Kavanaugh was seen sexually harassing a female student while at Yale.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Democratic presidential candidates, pushed for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment.\n\nHarris and Warren had voted against Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, a process during which Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while they were high school students in the 1980s.\n\nKavanaugh vehemently denied the claim during what became a bitter confirmation process, which catapulted the debate over the sexual assault allegations into daily conversation amid the #MeToo movement. It also prompted a backlash among those who felt the Supreme Court nominee was being unfairly judged for something that may or may not have happened over three decades ago.\n\n[Kavanaugh\u2019s accuser thought her life would be upended. She was right.]\n\nThose debates were reignited this weekend with the Saturday evening publication of the Times piece.\n\n\u201cHe was put on the Court through a sham process and his place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice,\u201d Harris said in a tweet. \u201cHe must be impeached.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump, meanwhile, accused the \u201cLameStream Media\u201d and Democrats of working together to scare Kavanaugh \u201cinto turning Liberal.\u201d\n\nTrump also said Sunday on Twitter that Kavanaugh should \u201cstart suing people\u201d or the Justice Department \u201cshould come to his rescue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nIn a statement, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also defended the Justice. \u201cThe far left\u2019s willingness to seize on completely uncorroborated and unsubstantiated allegations during last year\u2019s confirmation process was a dark and embarrassing chapter for the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cFortunately a majority of Senators and the American people rallied behind timeless principles such as due process and the presumption of innocence.\u201d\n\nKavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-to-48 Senate vote.\n\nThe Times piece was adapted from the upcoming book \u201cThe Education of Brett M. Kavanaugh: An Investigation.\u201d In it, the reporters said they had corroborated a prior claim of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, and that they found the FBI interviewed none of the potential witnesses they spoke to.\n\nDeborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh\u2019s, had alleged during his confirmation process that he had exposed himself to her in college. Her account had received less attention than Ford\u2019s at the time of his confirmation. Ford had testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\n\u201cDuring his Senate testimony, Mr. Kavanaugh said that if the incident Ms. Ramirez described had occurred, it would have been \u2018the talk of campus.\u2019 Our reporting suggests that it was,\u201d Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly wrote in the Times essay.\n\nThe reporters said that at least seven people they interviewed had heard about the incident, including the alleged victim\u2019s mother.\n\n[Review | In this account of the Kavanaugh hearings, no heroes or villains \u2014 just humans]\n\nFormer senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) said Sunday on NBC News\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that she is not sure how Democrats should proceed on the new revelations about the FBI background checks.\n\n\u201cThat was such a mess. And what it did for those of us who were running, it crystallized how bad Washington is. So if you were of Washington at that moment, frankly, the party didn\u2019t matter as much as the fact that you were part of that mess. And the mess really occurred because the information that needed to be investigated came out so late. And then it looked like a kneecap even though there were reasons it was late. I\u2019m not sure good ones,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut if the information had come out early, I think you could\u2019ve seen a full-thrown FBI investigation. But this isn\u2019t going away if the FBI never even bothered to talk to people surrounding this woman\u2019s allegation.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning that she still opposes Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation and that \u201cthere was a lack of a thorough FBI investigation\u201d into the allegations against him.\n\n\u201cMy concern here is that the process was a sham. I don\u2019t think you can look at impeachment hearings without getting the documents. The House would have to get the documents. And the attorney general is shielding documents,\u201d Klobuchar said.\n\nCat Zakrzewski contributed to this report.", "description": "The essay suggests the FBI\u2019s investigation into prior sexual assault claims was not thorough.", "authors": ["Emily Wax-Thibodeaux", "National Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Social Movements.", "September At Pm", "Emily Wax-Thibodeaux Is A National Staff Writer Who Covers National News", "With A Focus On Gender Issues", "Social Movements For The America Desk.
