And everybody was like, \u2018Yeah,\u2019\u201d Durant said, drawing laughter from reporters.\n\nSo it was really that simple?\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as crazy as me getting locked in my house,\u201d Jordan said jokingly, referring to that wild night four years ago when the Clippers persuaded him to change his mind and stay in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the end, as Irving put it, \u201cWe wanted to end our careers together, do it as a team, and what better place to do it than Brooklyn?\u201d\n\nThe truth is, the wheels were in motion long before the eve of free agency.\n\nThey all talked about the possibility two years ago, according to Jordan.\n\nRegardless, as late as early April, Nets higher-ups were expressing confidence behind the scenes that they were about to do something special during the summer.\n\nAnd once the stars aligned, the various parties involved worked hard to make the money work in a complicated salary-cap situation made easier once the Golden State Warriors realized they were going to lose K.D. and agreed to a sign-and-trade deal with Brooklyn that included D\u2019Angelo Russell.\n\nDurant got four years and $164 million. Irving got four years and $141 million. And Jordan received four years and $40 million.\n\nKevin Durant won't play this season, but has the focus on the Nets. (Nicole Sweet-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe largest outside free-agent deal the Nets had ever struck with a player before that? Jeremy Lin at three years and $36 million in 2016.\n\nStory continues\n\nEverything the \u201cMarkinson\u201d Nets had done to this point \u2014 preaching culture, family, continuity and player development ad nauseam \u2014 ended up paying off in the biggest way possible.\n\nThey turned late first-round picks Caris LeVert and Jarrett Allen into core pieces. They got to the playoffs with a team that many thought had no chance of getting there heading into last season. And they got their books in order.\n\nAs a result, coach Kenny Atkinson and general manager Sean Marks landed a pair of superstars who also happen to be best friends \u2014 without ever meeting them before they decided to join Brooklyn.\n\n\u201cI thought about it for a couple seconds,\u201d K.D. said of his free-agency decision that was thought to be between the Nets, Knicks, Clippers and Warriors. \u201cBut ultimately I wanted to be here.\u201d\n\nWatching YouTube videos of Atkinson coaching, KD said, helped influence his decision.\n\nIrving, the Jersey kid who grew up a Nets fan watching Jason Kidd, Richard Jefferson and Kenyon Martin transform the franchise in the early-2000s, wanted to be here, too. And early in the offseason, it seemed like a fait accompli.\n\n\u201cI wanted to reach out to Brooklyn at the start of free agency and let them know that my interest was very high,\u201d Irving said. \u201cAnd I had some pieces I wanted to bring with me as well.\u201d\n\nWith K.D. expected to be out for the season after having Achilles surgery, Irving will have the keys to the franchise in 2019-20.\n\nHe\u2019ll have a chance to put up monster numbers and change his perception around the league.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to prove everyone right \u2014 that I\u2019m the next one to take over the league for the next few years,\u201d said Irving, who opened up about how the death of his grandfather led him to want to return home and back out of his commitment to the Boston Celtics.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t give [my teammates in Boston] everything I had,\u201d Irving said. \u201cBringing everyone together, I failed.\u201d\n\nBut everyone will get a fresh slate in Brooklyn, with a franchise best known for its on-court failures, empty championship promises and flashy buildings. Deron Williams, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce all came up short \u2014 leaving the Nets with just one playoff series victory since they moved here in 2012.\n\nYet that could change quickly. Expectations are about to be ratcheted up. The organization is suddenly very interesting and relevant again, as evidenced by the more than 200 media members (including crews) in attendance for media day.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t any title talk, however, just Irving saying he wants to protect Durant from coming back too soon \u2014 \u201cWe all know K was not ready to play in that environment\u201d \u2014 and making sure his teammate is \u201c101 percent healthy\u201d before he returns.\n\nEither way, they don\u2019t want to waste this season either.\n\nAtkinson, in particular, pointed out various low win projections for his team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen, \u2018Nets win 38 games, 37 games, low 40s,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look at those as a negative thing. We understand the challenge.\u201d\n\nAdded Jordan: \u201cThe NBA is wide-open. It\u2019s anybody\u2019s game. But this isn\u2019t a practice season or a trial season. We want to go.\u201d\n\nIf you know where this franchise has been, seeing Durant (No. 7) and Irving (No. 11) both wearing Nets jerseys seems incomprehensible.\n\nWho knows if it\u2019s going to work?\n\nWho knows whether Durant can return to MVP form?\n\nWho knows whether Irving can learn from his past mistakes to become the leader he was supposed to be with Boston?\n\nYet here they both are in Brooklyn, at one of the most pristine practice facilities in the NBA, ushering in a new era of Brooklyn basketball. One built on superstardom. One built on friendship. And one \u2014 more importantly they hope \u2014 built on winning.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Brooklyn has star power, expectations and the NBA\u2019s attention now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/v13sh.HMVTlrqFJUB7jIJw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05MDcuNzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7ObpKsfg.5hU5I6CVKr2qQ--~B/aD00MDYzO3c9NTczMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/76263600-e15b-11e9-bf55-85fc9f7a03bd", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
