'And I am definitely going to open it up again.\n\n'I will make sure I open that one up and I'll make sure I open a new one up too.\n\n'It's going to be a bloody night for him and all I can say to him is \"buddy rest up, you're gonna need it, it's going to be a long and painful night.\"\n\n'Otto Wallin definitely gave Fury the fight of his damn life, to the point where he cut his eye open like three inches across. It was a hell of a bad cut and in fact, that fight should have been stopped.\n\nFury (left) and Wilder drew in their initial classic fight in 2018 and are expected to meet again\n\nFury is still unbeaten, and recently turned his hand to WWE in his break between fights\n\n'That was one of the worst cuts I've ever seen. You can compare it to the Lennox Lewis vs Vitali Klitschko fight which was stopped by the doctor because the cut was so bad. But this one went on.'\n\nFury sustained two thick cuts above his eye during the September 14 bout with Wallin in Las Vegas, making the night far harder than was initially expected.\n\nHis corner managed to keep him in the bout for the entire 12 rounds, but the 31-year-old was taken straight to hospital afterwards - where he received 47 stitches.", "description": "Speaking ahead of another potential match-up with the Gypsy King, the American admitted he will target the horror cut that Fury sustained in his unanimous decision victory over Otta Wallin.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/09/19579128-0-image-a-30_1570784072071.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
