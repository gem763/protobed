But can the company really absorb the impact of automation?\n\nA common refrain among companies that add scores of bots alongside human workers is that they will free up humans from menial tasks to do more interesting work.\n\nExperts worry that only a portion of humans will actually be \"freed up,\" and the rest face layoffs.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening at Walmart:\n\nIn many cases, such as with the truck-unloading bot, the machines are doing jobs that Walmart has long had difficulty filling anyway, says spokesperson Ragan Dickens.\n\nWalmart says it also has added 40,000 new online grocery picker jobs \u2014 people who assemble shopping bags for online customers \u2014 in the last two years.\n\nBut, but, but: As robots' capabilities expand, they could come for those and other jobs Walmart says it is setting aside for humans, says Brookings' West. \"Automation could threaten jobs because robots likely will perform many routine tasks.
