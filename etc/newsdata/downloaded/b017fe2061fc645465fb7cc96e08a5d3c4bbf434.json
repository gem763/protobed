He thinks you should take his pronouncement as an unassailable truth. He is, after all, a veteran.\n\nThe Naval Reserve Officer, who served a tour in Afghanistan, made the observation of firearms ownership to journalists traveling on an Iowa bus tour. Buzzfeed reporter Henry Gomez quoted the South Bend, Ind., mayor as saying, \u201cOver time, I realized having a gun made me feel smaller, not bigger.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting observation, for sure. It\u2019s also one that I\u2019m sure sits well with the gun control crowd that\u2019s looking for the reluctant hero to bravely stand and apologize for actually performing one\u2019s duty in a combat zone. That\u2019s not my experience at all. Nor that of many other veterans with whom I served in Iraq and Afghanistan or in the many other far-flung places I\u2019ve carried a rifle in my 25 years as a Marine.\n\nMy experience is much different. Carrying a firearm never made me feel big. It never made me feel superior or anything that elevated me to a status above others. Even today, carrying a gun as a law-abiding citizen doesn\u2019t make me feel anything but responsible.\n\nMayor Pete, gun ownership isn\u2019t an ego-serving privilege. It\u2019s a right and one that is borne with a sense of duty, obligation and accountability.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest about firearms ownership. It\u2019s fun. Going to a range and shooting sporting clays, punching paper and ringing steel at distance can be \u2013 forgive the pun \u2013 a blast. At its core, though, I own guns because I love my family. I value their safety. I am duty-bound as a husband and father to provide for their safety and well-being. That means I\u2019m law-abiding to lawfully possess firearms and be permitted to carry them concealed. It also means I responsibly store my firearms when not in use, so they remain inaccessible to those who shouldn\u2019t have access to them, whether that is a child or a prohibited individual.\n\nEven today, the organization I work for now, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, works for real solutions to make our communities safer through several efforts to ensure firearms are in the hands of only those who can be trusted to possess them in a responsible manner.\n\nI\u2019m obligated to ensure for my family\u2019s safety and my community that I\u2019m safe and familiar when I handle that firearm. I\u2019m obligated to comply with the law as to where I can carry a gun and know how to use it properly and accurately. That obligation follows through to my everyday actions. I don\u2019t seek out trouble but avoid it. I\u2019m obligated to every other law-abiding firearms owner to follow foundational safety rules, local and federal laws. I\u2019m not just being watched by those who despise firearms. I\u2019m being watched more closely by the more than 100 million firearms owners in America who daily exercise their Second Amendment rights.\n\nHolding a gun, wearing it in a holster on my body, carrying a shotgun or rifle into the marshes or woods to hunt doesn\u2019t make me feel bigger. It makes me understand the great sense of responsibility I have as an American who chooses to exercise my rights. Carrying a rifle into combat didn\u2019t make me feel bigger than the enemy I faced. It didn\u2019t make me feel above those whom I was there to set free from murderous terrorists and tyrannical regimes. It made me responsible for the safety of the Marines, sailors, soldier and airmen who walked the battlefield alongside me.\n\nOwning a gun isn\u2019t a small matter. Or an ego-inflating matter. Over time, I realized having a gun made me know \u2013 not feel - unapologetically responsible.", "description": "Mayor Pete Buttigieg believes simply holding a firearm is somehow .10/04/2019 12:53:52PM EST.", "authors": ["Mark Oliva", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/178/15e36722-d96b-4381-bd4d-722ecdcb3531.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
