They said Sato looked at other images she shared, such as her apartment, to figure out where she lived.\n\nPolice say he hurt her and committed indecent acts, such as groping her after accosting her from behind and knocking her down.\n\nJapan has many young female performance groups.\n\nTokyo Shimbun, a metropolitan daily, which reported on the stalking case, warned readers even casual selfies may show surrounding buildings that will allow people to identify the location of the photos.\n\nIt also said people shouldn\u2019t make the V-sign with their hand, which Japanese often do in photos, because fingerprints could be stolen.\n\nCyberstalking has been a problem for years, with criminals and perpetrators of domestic violence using hacking, clandestine activation of microphones and cameras and other methods to track their victims.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how prevalent the use of high-resolution photos to locate potential victims might be.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/11/japan-man-arrested-stalking-pop-star-using-photos-eyes-pupils/3942667002/", "description": "Hibiki Sato, 26 was arrested Sept. 17 on suspicion of indecent behavior in connection with stalking and causing injuries to the 20-year-old woman.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published A.M.
