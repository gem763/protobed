REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/Illustration /File Photo\n\nTransport for London (TfL) rejected the Silicon Valley company\u2019s license renewal request in 2017 due to failings it said it found in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks, prompting legal action.\n\nA judge in 2018 then granted Uber (UBER.N) a probationary 15-month license, which expires on Sep. 25, after the firm had made several changes to its business model in London, its most important European market.\n\nTfL said the new two-month license comes with \u201cnew conditions to ensure passenger safety\u201d and it wanted more details from the company.\n\n\u201cUber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator license to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application,\u201d said a spokesman.\n\nUber said it will work closely with TfL and provide any additional information.\n\n\u201cWe will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London,\u201d said Jamie Heywood, Uber\u2019s Regional General Manager for Northern & Eastern Europe.\n\nThe 2017 license loss came just weeks after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi took over and became a test of his ability to assuage regulator concerns as the app faced disputes with rival firms and the authorities in different markets.\n\nDrivers of the city\u2019s traditional black taxis have lobbied hard against a license renewal, having long cited safety issues, working standards and the undercutting of their business model.\n\nUber (UBER.N) says its roughly 45,000 drivers in the city enjoy the flexibility of their work and that it has taken several steps to improve safety for its passengers.\n\nThe new conditions set by TfL cover ride-sharing, appropriate insurance and driver document checks by Uber.\n\nUber received a five-year license in 2012 but fellow ride-hailing service Ola gained just a 15-month right to operate earlier this year, in a possible sign that the regulator wants to have more power over new entrants.\n\nMayor Sadiq Khan, who is also the chairman of TfL, has long been critical of Uber, telling LBC radio last month that they need to play by the rules.\n\n\u201cYou will know my track record which is standing up to the big boys, and they are boys, and make sure everyone plays by the rules,\u201d he told listeners to a phone-in. \u201cI don\u2019t care how many lawyers you employ or how big your PR budget.\u201d", "description": "Uber on Tuesday received only a two-month London operating license, failing to secure a maximum five-year term in a battle with the regulator which has previously stripped the app of its right to take rides.", "authors": ["Costas Pitas", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433267267&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0KD-OCATC", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
