As she fell to the dock below, bystanders says she let out a blood curdling scream.\n\nLawyers representing the family in a civil case against the cruise liner say it was clearly a tragic accident and that the family\u2019s goal remains for something such as this to never happen again.\n\n\u201cHad the cruise line simply followed proper safety guidelines for windows, this accident likely would never have happened.\u201d\n\nDays after the accident Chloe\u2019s father, Alan, and her mother, Kimberly, from Indiana in the US, told the Today Show that they don\u2019t blame Sam for their daughter\u2019s death.\n\nThey blame the cruise liner for leaving the window open inexplicably and their explanation \u2013 that it was open for \u201cventilation\u201d\u2013 isn\u2019t good enough.\n\n\u201cThere are a million things that could\u2019ve been done to make that safer. Why on earth is a window open on the 11th floor without a screen or anything? Their answer was \u2018We need ventilation\u2019. Well, to that I say, \u2018Get a fan\u2019,\u201d says Kimberly.\n\nSam is being held on $80 000 (R1,1 million) bail and is scheduled to appear in court on 20 November.\n\n\u201cHe is very, very distraught,\u201d Alan says.\n\n\u201cHe was extremely hysterical. The thing he repeatedly told us was, I believed there was glass. He would cry, over and over.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt no point ever, ever, has Sam put our kids in any danger,\u201d Kimberly says. \u201cYou can barely look at him without him crying. She [Chloe] was his best friend.\u201d\n\nSources: Daily Mail, Facebook", "description": "The grandfather who allegedly dropped his 18-month-old granddaughter from the 11th deck of a cruise ship has been charged with negligent homicide.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9537/68751f53c80046ec93d33fd2187f69d9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
