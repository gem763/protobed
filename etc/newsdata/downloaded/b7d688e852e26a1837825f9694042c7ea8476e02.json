I\u2019d be very surprised if half of the lawmakers on the committee even hear half of what\u2019s being said. A lot clearly aren\u2019t paying attention (as you\u2019ll see in a moment). However, as noted earlier today, many witnesses are there to try and elicit emotions, not to talk facts.\n\nThat\u2019s because they want people to throw off rationality. It works, unfortunately. It works because people are emotional creatures. That\u2019s why anti-gunners like to bring speakers who can talk from emotion; because it does sometimes sway people.\n\nHowever, Amy Swearer of the Heritage Foundation was one who came in armed with facts. However, that wasn\u2019t all she brought to the table during her prepared remarks. No, not at all.\n\nNo, she was able to bring a bit of emotion herself.\n\n.@AmySwearer delivering basic facts about how Americans use firearms to @HouseJudiciary in their hearing on \u201cassault weapons\u201d is the dopamine hit I didn\u2019t know I needed\u2014but I wasn\u2019t expecting the story about her mom. If #2A twitter doesn\u2019t know who Amy is yet they should today. pic.twitter.com/Aw3Fl1mFOa \u2014 Lyndsey Fifield (@lyndseyfifield) September 25, 2019\n\nWow.\n\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with Swearer\u2019s work before now, but I\u2019m definitely going to be following her going forward. She just laid down a powerful defense of the Second Amendment and assault weapons with both fact and emotion.\n\nThe anecdote about her mother not being very good with a handgun but being able to use an AR-15 accurately shouldn\u2019t really surprise us. There are a lot of reasons why that would be the case. The longer distance between the front and back sights, for example, helps with accuracy. The stance one takes with a rifle is a bit more stable as well. Plus, there\u2019s less chance of flinching with a rifle than a handgun.\n\nAnd there\u2019s tons of stuff I\u2019m probably not even thinking about.\n\nRegardless, that right there is the argument. That is why people have AR-15s.\n\nRight now, a lot of lawmakers like Rep. Lucy McBath\u2013who, we will note, seemed to not be paying particular attention to Swearer\u2019s remarks\u2013don\u2019t think you or I should have AR-15s. They think they should be reserved for military and law enforcement use, even though the military doesn\u2019t actually use AR-15s.\n\nYet Swearer illustrates why they\u2019re needed. She gives them the answer to the question, \u201cWhy does anyone need an AR-15?\u201d They need them because for some, it\u2019s the best way for them to be able to defend their life. It\u2019s just that simple, and that part of Swearer\u2019s testimony is what folks like us need to counter with when someone asks that question.\n\nIt\u2019s all fine and good to argue that an assault weapon ban is unconstitutional. I agree it is. However, that argument isn\u2019t going to change the minds of the very people who are pushing to infringe on those constitutionally protected rights. They aren\u2019t going to be swayed by that in the least. \u201cOh, it\u2019s unconstitutional? Well, I guess I\u2019m opposed to gun control now,\u201d said no one ever.\n\nYou need a better argument, and I think Swearer has presented a solid one. It won\u2019t sway the die-hard partisans one way or another, obviously, but you\u2019re not arguing to change their minds. You\u2019re arguing to change the minds of those who may be observing, those who may have moms who they worry about and want to keep a bit safer yet who can\u2019t hit the broadside of a barn with their handguns.\n\nAmy Swearer is a name you all need to learn and follow.
