REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nAKCAKALE, Turkey (Reuters) - Armed Turkish military vehicles crossed into Syria on Sunday and headed southwest with U.S. counterparts to begin planned joint patrols to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d along a border region mainly controlled by Kurdish forces.\n\nVehicles with Turkish flags joined those in Syria with U.S. flags some 15 kilometres (nine miles) east of the Turkish border town of Akcakale, near Syria\u2019s Tel Abyad.
