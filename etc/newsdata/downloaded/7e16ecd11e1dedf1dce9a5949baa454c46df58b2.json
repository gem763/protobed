It's deserved.\n\n\"We hide in the warehouse when the store is dead\"\n\nWorking the graveyard shift comes with certain perks.\n\nOne of them being hiding in the warehouse with your other colleagues.\n\n\"Sometimes, we eat the food\"\n\nA box of Celebrations has broken and exploded all over the shop floor?\n\nOh no... guess that's going somewhere discreet in the warehouse for snacktime later...\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Customers are messy - and it's annoying\"\n\nNo, please, don't worry as I clear up this smashed bottle of red wine from the shop floor.\n\nOh and you dropped a dog food tin in the next aisle? Cool, don't worry about helping.\n\n\"But the worst are the ones who graze as they shop\"\n\nThe ones that pick at French sticks and eating half a bag of cookies before they get to the till are absolutely shameless.\n\nThen you have to touch the grubby packaging when you put it through the till. Great.\n\n\"Everyone hates being on the tills\"\n\nYou have to interact with people more and there is nowhere to hide.\n\n\"Facing up and stock rotation is the worst job known to man\"\n\nIt's so much easier just to stuff all of the new stuff at the front.\n\nWho cares if it goes out of date before you buy it...\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"No, we cannot give you things for free\"\n\nEven if it doesn't scan.\n\nWe can't give you our discount either so stop asking.\n\n\"We see you trying to get to the store at 3.59pm on a Sunday\"\n\nAnd yes, it did make me lock the door that little bit faster.\n\n\"Need any help packing?\"\n\nPlease say no, we really just want you to say no.\n\n\"If you huff at me, I'll go slower\"\n\nHuffing never got anyone anywhere and it certainly won't make me scan your shopping faster.\n\n\"And if you're rude to me, I'll make you explode in my head\"\n\nIt's just one therapeutic technique us cashiers like to employ when we really can't say what we want to to your face.\n\nInstead we'll just smile overtly and make you disappear with our minds...\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I don't care how old you are\"\n\nWe have to ID you if you look under 25 - because if we don't and you actually are underage, we get fined.\n\nI don't care when your birthday is or how many years you've been on the planet, this is purely self preservation and admin.\n\n\"Stay away from the salad bar\"\n\nIt's not as fresh as you think.\n\n\"Yes, I do have to pay for my lunch - stop asking\"\n\nIt's a toss up between a greasy sausage sandwich from the staff canteen upstairs or the very same meal deal you came in to buy yourself.\n\n\"If you hover near me while I'm reducing food, I will go slower\"\n\nHopefully that 11p off will be worth the extra five minutes of waiting, Sharon.\n\n\"We see you people that come in everyday - and we judge you\"\n\nDon't you have anything better to do?
