Having won a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - aimed at bringing into effect the Brexit deal he's reached with the EU - Boris Johnson lost a second vote on its timetable, as MPs rejected the idea of getting it through Parliament in three days. So the government \"paused\" the bill.\n\nEU leaders are now considering whether to delay the Brexit deadline beyond 31 October, which the prime minister was forced under law to request in a letter at the weekend. But Mr Johnson and his colleagues don't want the date postponed as far ahead as the end of January. And if EU leaders offer this, the PM will call for a general election.\n\nThe problem is that he doesn't have enough MPs to trigger one and needs the support of other parties to make this happen. We explain the rules.\n\nHouse of Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg called the situation \"purgatory\". So what could happen next? Here's BBC Europe editor Katya Adler's take on the EU's position.\n\nAnd BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg writes that the Halloween deadline for Brexit is now unlikely to be met.\n\nPlus, the BBC's Brexitcast reacts to the extraordinary events in Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nBlood pressure pills 'work better at bedtime'\n\nExperts believe the body's biological \"clock\" - or 24-hour rhythms - mean its response to medication varies by the time of day. With this in mind, a Spanish study suggests taking blood pressure pills shortly before bedtime to increase protection against heart attacks and strokes. Here are the findings.\n\nGet news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning\n\nParalympian ends her life through euthanasia\n\nA Belgian Paralympian who won medals in wheelchair races at the 2012 and 2016 Games has ended her life through euthanasia at the age of 40.

People think we shamelessly massage statistics, overconfidently make terrible predictions, and are no fun at drinks parties.\n\nPerhaps some of the blame for this lies with the man who, a century ago, was probably the most famous economist in the world - Irving Fisher. A fitness fanatic, he avoided meat, tea, coffee and chocolate.\n\nHe didn't drink alcohol either, and was an enthusiastic supporter of prohibition, America's ill-fated attempt to outlaw its manufacture and sale, which began in 1920.\n\nIt was a remarkable change - the country's fifth-largest industry was suddenly made illegal.\n\nRead the full article\n\nWhat the papers say\n\n\"Brexit is in purgatory\" is the Daily Telegraph's headline, echoing Jacob Rees-Mogg's description, as the press comes to terms with the government's defeat on the timetabling of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. But, the Financial Times notes, it followed a vote in favour of the bill itself. Invoking the spirit of the Little Britain teenager Vicky Pollard, the Sun's headline is \"Yeah but no but...\" And the Daily Mail reports that MPs have turned \"triumph into disaster\". Elsewhere, the Times leads on a possible \"turning point\" in the treatment of Alzheimer's and the Daily Star says it has found a man claiming to have \"kidnapped\" a cardboard cut-out of singer Sir Cliff Richard from an airport.\n\nDaily digest\n\nTurkey Syria offensive Erdogan and Putin strike deal over Kurdish forces\n\nBritons killed abroad UK support \"patchy\" for grieving families\n\nPremature births Babies born at 22 weeks \"can now survive\"\n\nSex work The students turning to it to pay bills\n\nIf you see one thing today\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nWhy smart people do stupid things\n\nIf you listen to one thing today\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nEsther Duflo and women in economics\n\nIf you read one thing today\n\nShould children with type 2 diabetes get a gastric band?\n\nSign up for a morning briefing direct to your phone\n\nLookahead\n\n12:00 Prime Minister's Questions takes place in the House of Commons.\n\n15:00 Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the US House Financial Services Committee.\n\nOn this day\n\n1956 Tens of thousands of people take to the streets in Hungary to demand an end to Soviet rule.\n\nFrom elsewhere\n\nThe lessons of a shootout in Sinaloa (Economist)\n\nI've been pregnant nine times.
