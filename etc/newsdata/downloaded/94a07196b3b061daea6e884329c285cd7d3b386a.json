Chief executive David Johnston made kick-off with two minutes to spare; it was all a bit too uncomfortable for everyone in black and white.\n\n'I can't even start talking about the first round,' Chris admits. 'I know we are ball number 56 but that's it, I don't want to tempt fate.'\n\nDarlington ended their nine-year wait to return to the first round proper of the FA Cup\n\nTamworth supporters watched Darlington produce a clinical display to progress to round one\n\nPessimism remains, for now, but a lot has changed since Darlington last found themselves at this stage. They are now fan-owned, a young and hungry group of players has been assembled and the disappointments of yesteryear are trying to be forgotten.\n\nBut there were too many similarities to that day at Hinckley that had supporters like Chris and Lee desperately avoiding any air of arrogance.\n\nLike 2011, they were on the road again against a side ranked below them in the football pyramid. They still had plenty to do.\n\nThe old fashioned Lamb Ground saw more than 1,300 fans arrive on Saturday afternoon\n\nDarlington showed plenty of early promise and took just nine minutes to make it all count\n\nComprehensively beaten 3-0 that day, chairman Raj Singh had had enough, within a week he had vowed he was pulling his funding, the money was stopping and the club would soon drop back into administration.\n\nROAD TO WEMBLEY Sportsmail is on a journey through the FA Cup, following a side from the extra preliminary round until they are beaten, then continuing with their conquerors. The journey so far: Tividale 2-1 Wednesfield Tividale 0-5 Chasetown Chasetown 1-0 Staveley MW Leamington 2-2 Chasetown Chasetown 1-2 Leamington (aet) Leamington 0-2 Darlington Tamworth 0-3 Darlington Journey to Wembley, a chronicle of the 1976-77 FA Cup by Sportsmail\u2019s Brian James, also began at Tividale.\n\nLosing to Hinckley changed the history of the club as it is today, that much is certain. Winning at Tamworth could complete full circle, one fan told Sportsmail.\n\nAlun Armstrong's side wasted little time in easing any nerves harboured by the travelling fans with 20-year-old on-loan striker Tyrone O'Neill firing in smartly from Adam Campbell's right-wing cross after nine minutes.\n\nLet me entertain you by Robbie Williams played in the moments before kick-off and Tamworth tried to put on a show, committing plenty of men forward and while 1-0 down, were handed a lifeline before the interval when Ryan Beswick stepped up to take a penalty.\n\nDarlington's on-loan goalkeeper Liam Connell, blinded by the sun, asked a supporter for a cap and he was quickly provided. Up stepped Beswick and diving low to his left was Connell to make a strong save before parrying the follow-up.\n\nChants of 'sign him up, sign him up' rang out behind the goal he was protecting. Lady Luck was with them, it seemed.\n\nHome fans tried to rally Tamworth and they did get a response as the game opened up\n\nBut Darlington continued to establish their dominance and it proved a frustrating afternoon\n\nMoments later, with Tamworth licking their wounds, Darlington were ruthless as Omar Holness made it 2-0. The gloss was added midway through the second half when the gangly O'Neill added his second, and the Quakers' third. The job was done as the tin-foil FA Cup was thrown aloft by a teenage supporter who had made the 153-mile trip.\n\n'I am so pleased for the fans,' Armstrong said. 'You can feel the atmosphere is changing now at Darlington. I can feel it, the players can feel it and the fans are realising it. This has been a long time coming.'\n\nNot since 1989-90 when Brian Little was in charge of the club have fans seen three FA Cup wins in a single season. For some stood in the packed out away end on Saturday, this group was re-writing history in front of their eyes.\n\nWins away at Trafford, Leamington and now Tamworth got them there, now all the talk was about a potential hop, skip and a jump to face Sunderland at the Stadium of Light.\n\nFinancially, Armstrong adds, that game would transform the club having already secured \u00a318,000 in prize money with their latest win, their fifth in a row in all competitions.\n\nTamworth fans arrived dreaming of a repeat of 2011-12 when they enjoyed a magical run to the third round, losing 2-0 at Everton. But this was to be Darlington's day, Darlington's moment and after a frantic 90 minutes, it was silence for the Lambs.", "description": "NATHAN SALT AT THE LAMB GROUND: Traffic caused havoc for the team bus and many fans and there was a sense that, like it was eight years ago, maybe the footballing gods were intervening.", "authors": ["Nathan Salt For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/15/19957530-0-image-a-22_1571582465461.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
