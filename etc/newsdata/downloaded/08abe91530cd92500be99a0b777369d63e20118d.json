Much of the messaging centered on the suggestion that people have fewer children of higher quality, which Oliver notes is not how children work.\n\nUnder the one-child policy, Chinese citizens who had a second child could not register the birth of the child without paying a massive fine. The result is 6.5 million Chinese with no official status, rendering many of them unable to marry or work.
