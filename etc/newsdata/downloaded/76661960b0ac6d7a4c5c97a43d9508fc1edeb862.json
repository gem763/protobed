Bernie Sanders is trying to allay speculation that he would be cutting back on his campaign appearances after suffering a heart attack last week.\n\nThe 78-year-old independent senator from Vermont emphasized at the beginning of a video he sent to supporters and posted on Twitter on Thursday that \u201cI am feeling great. I am getting my endurance back and I look forward to getting out on the campaign trail as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nAnd to hammer home the point, the populist lawmaker, who\u2019s making his second straight White House bid, concluded the video by highlighting that \u201cI am feeling really good. I\u2019m getting stronger every day. We\u2019re going to be out there on the campaign trail. We\u2019re going to be in the debate in Columbus, Ohio next week.\u201d\n\nSANDERS SAID HE MISSPOKE ON SLOWING PACE OF HIS CAMPAIGN\n\nSanders has been off the campaign trail since being hospitalized early last week after he experienced chest pains at an event in Nevada. He\u2019s been resting at his Vermont home since being released from the hospital on Friday.\n\nSanders, who's the oldest candidate in either party running in the 2020 presidential campaign, told reporters outside his home earlier this week that he would be slowing the pace of his normally frenetic campaigning.\n\n\u201cWe were doing in some cases five or six meetings a day, three or four rallies and town meetings and meeting with groups of people,\u201d he explained. \u201cI don't think I'm going to do that. But I certainly intend to be actively campaigning. I think we can change the nature of the campaign a bit. Make sure that I have the strength to do what I have to do.\"\n\nThose comments made headlines, sparking speculation about Sanders\u2019 endurance.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nIn an interview Wednesday with NBC News, Sanders said: \"I misspoke the other day. I said a word I should not have said and media drives me a little bit nuts to make a big deal about it.\u201d\n\n\"We're going to get back into the groove of a very vigorous campaign, I love doing rallies and I love doing town meetings,\u201d he explained before adding that \"I want to start off slower and build up and build up and build up.\"\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s interview, Sanders also pushed back against criticism that his campaign was not transparent about the heart attack. When he was hospitalized, his campaign initially said it was because of a blockage in the senator\u2019s artery.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" Sanders said. \"I don't know what people think campaigns are, you know we're dealing with all kinds of doctors and we wanted to have a sense of what the hell was going on\u2026I think we acted absolutely appropriately.\"", "description": "For a second straight day, Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
