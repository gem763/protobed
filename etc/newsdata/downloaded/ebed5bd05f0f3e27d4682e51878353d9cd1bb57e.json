(Absent from the field are last year\u2019s World Series champs, the Boston Red Sox.)\n\nThough it has been a while since a couple of those teams (Rays, Cardinals) made the postseason, many of them made the playoffs last season and have rosters boasted proven October performers.\n\nAccording to MLB.com, the Dodgers have the best playoff performer out of the bunch in outfielder Cody Bellinger.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the rare player who is truly great at everything,\u201d MLB says of Bellinger. \u201cHe hits for power and average, he gets on base, he\u2019s a fantastic fielder, he cut down his strikeouts this year and he even stole 15 bases. He\u2019s the ideal baseball player, and he\u2019s riveting to watch. This could be his superhero postseason.\u201d\n\nFollowing Bellinger on MLB\u2019s list of top playoff performers are Justin Verlander (Astros), Gerrit Cole (Astros), Alex Bregman (Astros), Anthony Rendon (Nationals), Max Scherzer (Nationals), Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. (Braves), Matt Chapman (Athletics), Jack Flaherty (Cardinals) and Aaron Judge (Yankees).\n\nWe\u2019ll have a chance to see how it plays out starting tomorrow when the Rays visit the Athletics in the AL Wild Card Game tomorrow. That\u2019ll be followed by the Brewers taking on the Nationals in the NL Wild Card Game on Wednesday.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at MLB.com", "description": "This year's 10-team postseason field is made up of the Astros, Dodgers, Yankees, Twins, Braves, Cardinals, Athletics, Rays, Nationals and Brewers.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176011489-e1569854204396.jpg?fit=742%2C494", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
