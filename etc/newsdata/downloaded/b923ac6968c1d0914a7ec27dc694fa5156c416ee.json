She loves princesses and singing. Oh, and racing dragsters.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Race car driver Kolette Dicero, of Pittsboro, Ind., is an energetic 7 year old. She loves school, princesses and driving fast in her two race cars. Mykal McEldowney, IndyStar\n\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Kolette Dicero woke up, placed her favorite stuffed animal, Papa Bear, on her pillow and climbed down from her loft bed.\n\nShe hurried to her closet to pick out a dress, wedge-heeled shoes and a purse.\n\nHer father, Anthony, reminded her: \u201cHey, you know we\u2019re going racing, right?\u201d\n\nAnthony Dicero has made a career out of the racing business. But he was not the one drag racing today. His 7-year-old daughter was.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her to stop being a girlie-girl,\u201d Dicero said, \u201cbut I still like that she races.\u201d\n\nNow, you might wonder whether 7 years old is a little young for drag racing. Well, she started at 5.\n\nA family affair\n\nAfter some small tweaks, Kolette loads into her quarter midget during practice at Indy Mini Speedway at the Indiana State Fairgrounds on Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2019. (Photo: Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar)\n\nThe interest emerged at age 1. It was in her father's Brownsburg, Indiana garage, the one he used to share with professional NHRA drag racer Antron Brown.\n\nBrown stored his sons' junior dragsters next to Dicero'sprofessional dragster.\n\n\"She'd be running around in the shop and see his kids' junior dragsters, and she'd always be sitting in them,\" Dicerosaid. \"We knew early on that she liked princesses, race cars and singing.\"\n\nDicero and his wife, Jess, decided to buy a junior dragster when Kolette was 3. Dicero's father brought him up around drag racing, and he has since made a career out of working on, tuning or owning a dragster or sprint car team.\n\n\"By the time she was 4 she was saying, 'When's my turn?'\" Dicero said. \"By the time she was 5, it was, 'OK. Let's go.'\"\n\nA junior dragster is about 15 feet long and nearly 300 pounds with a 5 horsepower Briggs & Stratton motor. Yes, your lawnmower might have a 5 horsepower engine, but can it reach speeds up to 85 mph? Kolette's speed is restricted to 50 mph. After all, she is a second-grader.\n\n\u201cYou know kids at school. They all have their own hobbies,\u201d her father said. \u201cKolette\u2019s hobby is completely different from everybody else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe thrill of drag racing\n\nIn early August, after her first day of second grade at Pittsboro (Indiana) Primary School, Kolette grabbed a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and headed to Lucas Oil Raceway.\n\nRevving engines and screeching tires rattled ears. Smoke from tire burnouts filled the air. The event was Wild Wednesday, when men and women drag race their everyday road vehicles such as Honda Civics or Buick Roadmasters.\n\nKolette waited in line for her turn. On this night, she wasn't facing an opponent in the NHRA Junior Drag Racing League she competes in. She was just practicing.\n\nKolette Dicero speeds down the strip at Lucas Oil Raceway at 50 mph on Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2019. (Photo: Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar)\n\nHer mother bent down to give Kolette a kiss through the opening in her helmet. Her father told her he loved her. Then he pull-started the dragster's engine.\n\nKolette edged up to the start line. She watched the light tree. Yellow-yellow-yellow-green!\n\nPressing hard on the gas in her pink shoes, Kolette took off. She finished the eighth-mile strip in 13.9 seconds, running just under 52 mph.\n\n\u201cDriving the dragster feels like you\u2019re going 1,000 mph,\u201d Kolette said after her run. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019re going so fast you cannot breathe.\u201d\n\nSponsored by 'Nanner Puddin'\n\nA month later Kolette was sitting at a table with her parents at Rusted Silo Southern BBQ & Brew House in Lizton, Indiana. This was a business meeting with the restaurant's owner, a potential sponsor.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s all girl, but her passion is very apparent,\u201d said Rob Ecker, who already sponsors two drivers: Brinton Marvel, who drives winged sprint cars in the same class as Tony Stewart, and Michael Meyers, who drives in the Lucas Oil Formula Car series. \u201cWe want to help make dreams come true for her.\u201d\n\nKolette, mid-meeting and not wanting anything for free, headed to the kitchen, determined to earn her sponsorship money.\n\nShe grabbed a pair of rubber gloves, pulled them over her fingers with their checkered-flag fingernail polish, and walked behind the counter to help prepare meals.\n\n\"I love this so much,\" said Kolette, as she dished out her banana pudding, on Wednesday, Sept. 18, 2019. The dessert is her dish of choice and now the sponsorship wording on her both of her race cars. (Photo: Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar)\n\nEcker\u2019s daughter, Karisa, who works at the restaurant, covered her mouth and laughed as Kolette dished herself a double serving of \"Nanner Puddin.\" It's Kolette's dish of choice and now the sponsorship wording on both of her race cars.\n\nYes, both.\n\nKolette also zips around an oval track in a quarter midget. She has been racing those cars since she was 6.\n\n\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m dreaming,\u201d she said about driving her quarter midget. \u201cIt\u2019s just like butterflies flying into my face.\u201d\n\n'Girls rule'\n\nKolette, who recently took third place in her quarter midget during a Midwest Thunder Series race at Indy Mini Speedway at the Indiana State Fairgrounds, is typically the only girl on the track when she races. When asked whether she thinks she is a role model for other girls, she said she thinks she is.\n\n\u201cBoys drool, and girls rule,\u201d she said. \u201cI show courage, and you get to teach girls and gals that you can win the race, you\u2019re going to be in first place, you\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\n\n\"I really want to be a role model and take her under my wing,\" said Krista Baldwin, a third generation NHRA drag racer on Tuesday, Oct. 1, while fixing Kolette Dicero's hair after quarter midget practice. \"Both of our names start with K and we call each other sisters. We both lean on each other.\" Baldwin met Dicero in Charlotte when Dicero was three years old. (Photo: Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar)\n\nProfessional drag racer Krista Baldwin, a third-generation NHRA drag racer who met Kolette when she was 3 and is now her mentor, said you have to be strong to be a woman in the racing industry.\n\nBaldwin didn't have a female role model growing up. She wants to be that for Kolette. She wants to take her under her wing.\n\n\u201cYou have to be tough,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the race car doesn\u2019t know if you\u2019re a male or a female.\u201d\n\nContact IndyStar photojournalist Mykal McEldowney at 317-790-6991 or mykal.mceldowney@indystarr.com.
