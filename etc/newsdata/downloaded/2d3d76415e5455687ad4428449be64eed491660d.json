We already had a good idea of many of the things Samsung has done to reinforce the Fold, but iFixit\u2019s analysis gives us a much better look at its internal changes.\n\nOne of the bigger changes shown is the extra layer of metal that reinforces the phone\u2019s display. iFixit says it\u2019s \u201clike chainmail armor\u201d that sits between the screen and its backing plates. This is apparently enough to make the display rigid, even when it\u2019s separated from the chassis. However, there are also smaller changes, like the fact that the phone\u2019s hinges are now covered in tape as an extra protection against debris, and there\u2019s an \u201cextra sticky strip of black tar goop\u201d applied to the back of the display to stop it from coming loose.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Samsung quietly made all the durability quick-fixes we suggested in our original Fold teardown!\u201d\n\nThere are also the changes we already knew about from looking at the exterior of the device. The gaps at the top and bottom of the screen\u2019s fold, for example, are now covered by small T-shaped plastic protectors combined with a flexible gasket. The infamous \u201cAdvanced Polymer Protective Layer\u201d \u2014 which looked like a screen protector but was actually much more integral \u2014 now extends almost to the edges of the screen to make it much less tempting to pull off.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Samsung quietly made all the durability quick-fixes we suggested in our original Fold teardown!\u201d iFixit proudly proclaims, but that doesn\u2019t mean the device is perfect. iFixit still calls the phone \u201calarmingly fragile,\u201d and it\u2019s unclear how well the new devices will hold up in the real world. Overall, the repair specialist site awards the new phone a 2 out of 10 score for repairability, which is the same score as the original device.", "description": "iFixit has posted a detailed teardown of Samsung\u2019s revised Galaxy Fold.
