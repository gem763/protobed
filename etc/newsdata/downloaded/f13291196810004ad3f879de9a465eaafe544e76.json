Fitzmas Day has arrived. And those George W. Bush critics who have so eagerly anticipated it have to be a little disappointed.\n\nThere has been much high-minded talk about how the Valerie Plame controversy is really about the case for the Iraq war. No. For liberals, it has always been about inflicting as much damage as possible to the Bush White House, especially by taking out through indictment its most central player in the person of Karl Rove. That has not happened. Nor has special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald alleged a conspiracy at the top levels of the Bush administration to out a CIA agent. What he instead charges in his five-count indictment is that Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, Lewis \u201cScooter\u201d Libby, lied to investigators about conversations with three reporters. This long-hyped, two-year investigation appears to come down, in other words, to one man\u2019s alleged dishonesty when investigators came knocking. This is not Watergate or Iran-Contra, but neither is it a trifle.\n\n#ad#Please spare us the excuses warmed over from Democratic talking points in the 1990s: the prosecutor is out-of-control, there was no underlying crime, etc., etc. It is the responsibility of anyone, especially a public official, to tell the truth to FBI agents and grand juries. If Libby didn\u2019t, he should face the consequences. Fitzgerald\u2019s indictment is not a Ronnie Earle-style partisan production, held together with scotch tape and malicious intentions. But this is the prosecutor\u2019s day, when he gets to make the argument against his target unrebutted. Libby will get his chance to respond, and it might be that Fitzgerald\u2019s case looks weaker soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut conservatives would be well-advised not to start slamming Fitzgerald. We don\u2019t know all the facts and until we do, his acts are open to dueling interpretations. It seemed unfair for him to talk at his press conference of Libby damaging national security by revealing classified information, when Libby wasn\u2019t charged with that. But this was a departure for the otherwise restrained and responsible Fitzgerald. The Bush administration, for its part, has conducted itself with notable forbearance in this case, avoiding the sort of smears that the Clinton administration routinely resorted to whenever a prosecutor proved inconvenient.\n\n\u201cTwo years later,\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nwe still don\u2019t know\n\nimportant facts.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s merits aside, the limits of special-prosecutor investigations were once again evident in this case. Two years later, we still don\u2019t know important facts. Was Plame covert? Fitzgerald can\u2019t or won\u2019t say. Who is \u201cOfficial A\u201d (although we can all guess)? Who were the other unnamed officials? It is a prosecutor\u2019s job to build a criminal case, period, full stop. But in high-stakes political controversies, that\u2019s not really the public interest\u2013disclosure is. Then, everyone knows the facts and the public can make its judgments on what is appropriate. Offending officials can be punished with resignations and public obloquy. Except in dire cases\u2013say, bribery\u2013that process should take precedence over prosecutions rather than the other way around.\n\nUnfortunately, Republicans and Democrats engage in alternating opportunism over \u201cthe criminalization of politics,\u201d and it is the Democrats\u2019 turn to pin their political hopes on the work of a prosecutor.", "description": "The breathless waiting is over.
