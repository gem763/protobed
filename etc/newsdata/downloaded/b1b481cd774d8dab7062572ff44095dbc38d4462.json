Pelosi appears to be inching closer to the votes for an impeachment in the House, but it looks highly unlikely at this point that two-thirds of the GOP-controlled Senate would go along with it.\n\n\u201cMarkets have seen this Impeachment movie before,\u201d said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Richmond. \u201cSo what if the House impeaches, if the Senate will never remove the president from office? Markets are way more interested in a trade deal with China.\u201d\n\n7 takeaways from the rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine\u2019s president\n\nA quick look at history shows why markets are shrugging this off. President Bill Clinton faced an impeachment process starting in October 1998. He was impeached by the House two months later but ultimately acquitted by the Senate in February 1999. The stock market rose during that period \u2014 and so did the all-important consumer confidence barometer. (Consumer spending drives 70 percent of the economy.) The University of Michigan consumer confidence Index dipped to 97.4 that October but climbed to 108.1 by February.\n\nThe market situation was grimmer during President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s impeachment process. Stocks briefly rose after the February 1974 proceedings began and then declined all the way through August 1974, when Nixon resigned.\n\nAs JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients, it\u2019s hard to attribute much \u2014 if any \u2014 market movement in those prior eras to impeachment proceedings. Markets were a lot more focused in 1973 and 1974 on skyrocketing oil prices that tipped the U.S. economy into a recession. And in 1998, markets were a lot more fixated on the fact that the Asian financial crisis and the collapse of a hedge fund called Long-Term Capital Management were not spilling to the rest of the world.\n\nThe same effect is playing out now: What Wall Street really cares about is the trade war.\n\nHouse passes short-term spending bill, punting shutdown fight to November\n\nTrump told reporters Wednesday, \u201cIf you notice, the stock market went up\u201d after the release of a rough transcript of the Ukraine call that has drawn so much scrutiny. But even Fox Business pointed out that what really drove the market up Wednesday was Trump\u2019s comments that a China deal \u201ccould happen sooner than you think,\u201d not the transcript.\n\nThe bigger debate among traders and economists is whether impeachment proceedings move the dial at all on U.S.-China trade negotiations. A week ago \u2014 before news broke of a whistleblower\u2019s concerns about Trump\u2019s call \u2014 there were a lot of prominent voices in finance, such as JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and DoubleLine Capital head Jeffrey Gundlach, telling people that they did not think a deal will get done before the 2020 election. Why would China want to hammer out a deal when it\u2019s not clear who will be in the Oval Office after the vote?\n\nHas that changed a lot because of impeachment proceedings? Some say it tips the scales slightly in favor of a deal. The thinking goes like this: The Chinese could perceive Trump as weak, making this a moment to try to push for something quick and puny. Trump\u2019s words Tuesday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly were aimed at fueling that thesis and pushing the market higher.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still political upside to Trump and China to de-escalate the conflict, even if it\u2019s not a full deal,\u201d said Steve Pavlick, head of policy at Renaissance Macro Research and a former official in Trump\u2019s Treasury Department.\n\nWhat you need to know about the impeachment inquiry into Trump\n\nBut it\u2019s also easy to argue that the impeachment show changes little and that the scale is still tipped in favor of China holding out, meaning trade uncertainty remains through the election (and potentially beyond it, since a number of Democratic candidates also want to go after China and have even said they would initially keep tariffs in place). Trump has flip-flopped many times on China, tweeting or saying lines that sound optimistic one day and then slamming the Chinese the next.\n\nIt remains to be seen how impeachment affects other issues Wall Street is watching, such as the push for Congress to approve the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and a budget deal that needs to get done by Nov. 21 to prevent a government shutdown. The early read is that impeachment creates more gridlock, but Democrats appear aware that it\u2019s not good politics to head into the 2020 election as the party that shut down the government because they were fixated on impeachment.\n\nBeyond China, the focus is Election 2020, especially as the possibility of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) as the Democratic candidate rises. As Tory Newmyer outlined Tuesday in The Post\u2019s Finance 202 newsletter, there is a lot of concern among investors about a President Warren and the regulation she wants to bring for banks, traders and more.\n\n\u201cThe market will get more worried if over the next handful of months Bernie [Sanders] or Warren rises significantly in the polls,\u201d said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to tell how this will play out for the 2020 election. Public opinion has been against impeachment, but Pelosi made this decision after hearing from Democrats who represent swing districts, which seems to indicate some sense among Democrats that public opinion is shifting.\n\nThe main takeaway for the economy and markets is that there will be more uncertainty at a time when the uncertainty fire is already burning brightly. There\u2019s Brexit, Hong Kong protests, a slowing China, a Middle East flare-up and no end in sight to Trump\u2019s unpredictable trade war. But countering that, the Federal Reserve has promised to do whatever it takes to keep this expansion going.\n\nThe global economy is in trouble, and the U.S. economy is slowing. Impeachment probably won\u2019t alter that unless there is a dramatic turn of events. The key is the U.S. consumer. If American consumers shrug this off and continue spending, as they did in 1999, then the economy can keep growing and avoid a recession.\n\nRelated:\n\nthe Fed has \u2018put the economy into a more dangerous position,\u2019 central bank\u2019s Kashkari says\n\nThe Trump vs. Obama economy \u2014 in 15 charts\n\nFor the first time, most new working-age hires in the U.S. are people of color", "description": "A quick look at history shows why markets are shrugging impeachment off.", "authors": ["Heather Long", "Economics Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KOlJsng74dMMAbQsPZSXAO4Sq-k=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-24-2019/t_ba642180e0934006bf5f5f7a9cf1c846_name_07234e0e_df13_11e9_be7f_4cc85017c36f_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
