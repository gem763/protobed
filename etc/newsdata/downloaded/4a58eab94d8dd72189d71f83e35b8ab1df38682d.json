What does he do now?", "language": "en", "text": "He lampooned Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn to great effect, even volunteering the hard-left socialist for a forthcoming British space mission: \"Conference, can you think which communist cosmonaut to coax into the cockpit?\"\n\nHe made his anti-parliament populism palatable by sugar-coating it with humour. \"If Parliament were a laptop, then the screen would be showing the pizza wheel of doom ... If Parliament were a reality TV show, the whole lot of us would have been voted out of the jungle by now - but at least we could have watched the Speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle.\"\n\nThe speech was policy-free, content-free bluster. It was Oxford University debating society stuff. But still it offered something vital: a shot of morale.\n\nAnd it worked: suddenly it seemed as though Johnson might actually know what he is doing. He may have been winging it, but now there's a plausible semblance of things going to plan.\n\nWhat is the plan, exactly? Nobody, except perhaps Johnson and his inner circle, really knows for sure.\n\nThe big advance is that after a long period of prevarication, Johnson now has a solid Brexit proposal to negotiate with the European Union.\n\nThey may not like it, but he has lured them into the wrestling ring and they are going to have to get their hands dirty. And possibly even cop some blame if things break down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBacking out of the backstop\n\nTheresa May failed at Brexit because the Brexiteers in her own party abhorred the deal she negotiated with the EU. The opposition parties sensed her weakness and tried to bring her down regardless of their views on her deal. She had nowhere to go for supportive votes.\n\nJohnson didn't belong to the Brexiteer rebel squad known as the European Research Group, whose core members now revel in the name \"the Spartans\". But he blew his Telegraph trumpet for them, railing against the same bete-noire: the Northern Irish backstop.\n\nNobody wants to reimpose infrastructure and controls along the 500-kilometre border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Since the Troubles ended, the two sides have become deeply integrated. A hard border would stifle commerce, upset daily lives, and stoke resentment that could revive old hatreds and rekindle violence. It's little wonder Northern Ireland was the region that voted most strongly against Brexit.\n\nBut when May lost a swag of seats in the 2017 election, she fell into an arithmetic dependency on the Democratic Unionist Party, which feels an umbilical link to the British motherland. The DUP would not countenance the easy option of just keeping Northern Ireland aligned with the EU: that would draw a dotted-line border in the Irish Sea, separating the province from the British mainland.\n\nNot on land, not on sea - where to put the EU-British border? May's withdrawal agreement tried to solve this intractable problem by essentially shelving it for another day. Until a solution turned up, a \"backstop\" would keep Northern Ireland in regulatory alignment with the EU, and the whole of Britain in a customs union. No border, for now.\n\nThe Brexiteers hated it for two reasons. First, both sides had to agree on a new border solution before the backstop could be removed. The Spartans said this gave the EU the whip hand \u2013 the bloc had no incentive ever to let Britain go. \"Vassalage\", they called it. Second, if Britain was in the EU customs union it couldn't negotiate free-trade agreements with the likes of the US and Australia \u2013 it was in frustrating limbo.\n\nThe backstop allowed there to be no border. Johnson's plan, on the other hand, creates two borders. There's a customs border on the island of Ireland, so that Britain gets out of the EU's customs union and can strike free-trade deals. Johnson hopes innovative systems of decentralised checks \u2013 in companies' premises, with digital tagging \u2013 would obviate the need for any physical inspections on or near the border.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there's a regulatory border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland adheres to EU agricultural and industrial standards, allowing goods and livestock to move freely within the island. But as British rules start to diverge from the EU standards, the Northern Irish Assembly can periodically review whether to keep this arrangement or defect to the British regime.\n\nThe Irish don't like either of these ideas. They don't think the customs plan is workable or that it adheres to the peace accord known as the Good Friday Agreement, although perhaps they might be flexible on this.\n\nNobody wants a return to the bad old days on the Ireland-Northern Ireland border. AP\n\nBut they really don't like the idea of Northern Ireland having to go through an argument every few years about whether to stick with the EU or join the British regulatory regime, which they think will reheat potentially violent sectarian strife.\n\nThe EU won't like it if Ireland doesn't like it. And they'd prefer something legally watertight over Britain's slightly woolly, work-it-out-as-we-go-along proposal. Brussels has given London a week to fill out the pencil sketch with lots of ink.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThere's very little hope that Britain's alright-on-the-night Brexit proposal will pass muster in Dublin and Brussels. Johnson's plan, in that case, is to prepare for a no-deal Brexit on October 31, when time is formally up.\n\nBut the British Parliament has passed a law requiring Johnson to ask for a three-month extension if he hasn't got a deal \u2013 effectively prohibiting a Halloween no-deal Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson has been hinting that he might just break the law. And there's still a chance he might take the pretty reckless option of lunging unlawfully for the no-deal cliff-edge. But after this week, it looks more like his calculus has now changed.\n\nBecause of the anti-Brexit law, the EU has little incentive to rush to a deal. They'd be up for another Brexit delay, in case it leads to a second referendum that reverses the first, or an election that brings about a change in the political weather.\n\nJohnson's best option is now pretty clear. He needs to look as though he tried really, really hard for a deal. And then he goes ahead and requests the Brexit extension from the EU, as legally required.\n\nHe can squarely blame his broken promise on the dithering British Parliament, and on the intransigent EU for failing to compromise. And he can accuse them both of having a covert, anti-democratic agenda of trying to reverse the referendum result.\n\nThen all he has to do is engineer an election. And then all he has to do is win it.\n\nHis plan is to poach from Labour all those blue-collar voters who supported \"Leave\" in the referendum \u2013 hence the big-spending promises this past week on health, police, infrastructure and schools, the bread-and-butter stuff they care about.\n\nIt's worth a try: party loyalties have been frayed and politics reshaped by Brexit. But it's still a gamble. He'll likely lose seats in Scotland and the Remainer parts of England; and some of the Labour vote he's targeting is pretty rusted-on.\n\nStill, if Johnson's speech this week showed us one thing, it's that his confidence is growing, both in his message \u2013 the \"left-behind\" people versus the self-obsessed London \"Remainer\" elite \u2013 and also in his ability to sell it.\n\nHe's not really much chop at governing, but electioneering is his genuine superpower. He can almost taste the coming campaign, and that's what has him energised. The blustering bus-lover can't wait to get on the trail; he just has to be careful the wheel don't come off.", "description": "The British PM's most obvious way forward now is simple: try for a deal, fail, delay Brexit, blame everyone else \u2013 then win an election.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2897%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_100%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/24975f687d1775bdce261b2709a08d6375aa81a0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
