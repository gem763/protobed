Has either of the dynamics changed or do either of those orientations of Donald Trump suggest any of the investigations into him were misguided?\n\nJAMES COMEY: I\u2019ve seen no indication that he\u2019s been able to let go of this notion that he sees the intelligence community\u2019s findings as some sort of attack on his legitimacy as president. And because he sees it that way, he must attack it and all of those behind it.\n\nWALLACE: Are you surprised that he\u2019s now gotten an ally in the effort to attack the origins of the investigation? [Attorney general] William Barr seems very comfortable meddling in an investigation being run from the U.S. Attorney from Connecticut?\n\nCOMEY: I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on with the attorney general and that investigation. I was deeply concerned with some things he said early on about using the word \u201cspying\u201d and saying \u201ctheir things just don\u2019t make sense.\u201d At the time I said, \u201cthat\u2019s not how the pros operate.\u201d If there\u2019s a reason to investigate something, you shut up and try to gather the facts and then share them. I still feel that way. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re looking at. I\u2019m not really in a position to say you shouldn\u2019t investigate. Okay, if you\u2019re going to investigate, investigate. John Durhan is someone who has a strong reputation, someone for years I thought was an excellent prosecutor. I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on with the attorney general.\n\nI would hope that Mr. Durham would do everything possible to protect his reputation from being damaged by those in leadership and the most important way he can do that is, is give us transparency. I am not worried about a single thing in connection with any of the matters under investigation. Gather the facts, write a report, and share it with the American people. Please do that, because all the stuff in the media with attorney general same stuff doesn\u2019t just jive, it is an attack on the integrity of the institution, which he is supposed to be leading. The way to protect that is show the folks the facts. Lay it out. Don\u2019t drip it out, don\u2019t leak it out, give it out. I\u2019m confident that when the American people see the picture of why we did what we did, their confidence in the institution will be maintained, restored, and protected.", "description": "James Comey said he isn't concerned whatsoever about the DOJ's criminal investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Comey-Laughing-at-Politicon--640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
