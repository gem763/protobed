We have done this because we would like to maintain the number of bed spaces we have at the moment,\" the statement read.\n\nCity of Cape Town traffic spokesperson Richard Coleman acknowledged the heavy congestion around the area, adding that \"gates [at UWC] have been closed by security on campus\".\n\nUWC's statement continued: \"It is also important to state that the university has, since April 2019, been engaging bulk private accommodation providers in preparation for the 2020 academic year. These discussions are still ongoing and the plan is to ensure that there are additional bed spaces that are available to funded students, as landlords insist that they only accept fully-funded students.\n\n\n\n\"South Point, after consultations with UWC representatives, confirmed that the discussions are ongoing and feedback will be provided to UWC next week.\"\n\n\"The UWC executive management will be discussing this matter in detail next week and take a resolution on the way forward. The resolution will consider both short- and mid-term solutions, including plans supported by the Department of Higher Education and Training to build a new student residence with a capacity of 2 700 beds.\"\n\nDeans and heads of departments are looking into the few assignments and tests still to be done, and lecturers will communicate alternative arrangements to students as soon as possible, the university said.\n\nNext Tuesday is the last day of lectures.", "description": "Student accommodation protests at the University of the Western Cape's main campus in Bellville has caused traffic congestion around Robert Sobukwe Road and Symphony Way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9515/82ebbb6ba3b44e7c9249a92734626587.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
