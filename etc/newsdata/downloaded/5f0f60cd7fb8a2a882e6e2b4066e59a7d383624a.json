He averaged just 2.9 yards per carry with the Birmingham Iron.\n\nRB Jonas Gray \u2014 The Notre Dame product had a brief star turn for the Patriots in 2014, when he ran for 201 yards and a franchise-record four touchdowns in a win over the Colts. But five days later, he overslept and was late to practice, landing him in Bill Belichick's doghouse. He played sparingly the rest of the year and was released the following September.\n\nRB Noel Devine \u2014 Despite his four years at West Virginia in which he totaled more than 5,000 yards from scrimmage and 31 touchdowns, Devine is probably best known for becoming a viral sensation as a high school freshman thanks to his highlight reel.\n\nRB Christine Michael \u2014 The 2013 second-round pick out of Texas A&M struggled to find his footing in the NFL during stints with the Seahawks (twice), Cowboys, Packers and Colts.\n\nS Rahim Moore \u2014 Most widely known for giving up a game-tying deep touchdown strike from Joe Flacco to Jacoby Jones in the Broncos' eventual divisional playoff loss to the Ravens in 2012, the former second-round pick is still trying to revive his career.\n\nQB Matt McGloin \u2014 The former Penn State standout went 1-5 as a starter for the Raiders in 2015.\n\nRB Donnel Pumphrey \u2014 The all-time leading rusher in NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision history lasted just one season with the Eagles before being released.\n\nS Matt Elam \u2014 After starting 26 games in his first two years with Ravens, the former first-round pick missed the entire 2015 season with a torn bicep and then played sparingly as a backup before his contract expired.\n\nDE Kony Ealy \u2014 The 2014 second-round pick out of Missouri had 14 sacks in his first three years, but he was traded to the Patriots in 2017 and waived later that same year.\n\nRB Andre Williams \u2014 Bursting out as a rookie, Williams had 721 rushing yards and seven touchdowns in 2014 but never replicated his initial success.\n\nRB Matt Jones \u2014 The 2015 third-round pick briefly had a hold on the Redskins' starting running back position, running for 460 yards and three touchdowns in 2016.\n\nWR Sammie Coates \u2014 A third-round pick out of Auburn in 2015, Coates couldn't hang on in the NFL after stints with the Steelers, Browns and Texans.\n\nQB Tyree Jackson \u2014 After turning heads at this April's NFL scouting combine by running a 4.59-second 40-yard dash at 6-7 and 249 pounds, the Buffalo product went undrafted and failed to latch on with the Bills in training camp.\n\nQB Zach Mettenberger \u2014 The LSU product took over for Jake Locker with the Titans in 2014 and started 10 games in two years with the franchise.\n\nK Roberto Aguayo \u2014 A second-round pick of the Buccaneers in 2016, the former Lou Groza Award winner had a disastrous rookie campaign, converting just 22 of 31 field goal attempts. He was released the following August and has yet to make an active NFL roster since.\n\nWR Ryan Broyles \u2014 After being a two-time consensus All-American at Oklahoma, Broyles was a second-round pick of the Lions in 2012.\n\nWR Jacoby Ford \u2014 With a 4.28-second 40-yard dash, the former track and field standout turned heads with his blazing speed. He returned four kickoffs for touchdowns in four years with the Raiders.\n\nLB Arthur Brown \u2014 The former five-star recruit and second-round pick of the Ravens in 2013 played four years in the NFL.\n\nRB Cameron Artis-Payne \u2014 A first-team All-SEC pick at Auburn, he went on to serve as a backup on the Panthers from 2015-18.\n\nDT Will Sutton \u2014 After earning All-American honors at Arizona State, he went on to become a third-round pick of the Bears in 2014.\n\nLS Nate Boyer \u2014 Emerging as a walk-on at Texas after trainging himself to be a long-snapper by watching YouTube videos, the former Green Beret signed with the Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 2015.\n\nWR Jalen Rowell (Robinette) \u2014\u200b The former Air Force receiver's draft dreams were dashed in 2017 when the Department of Defense reversed course by ruling he would have to fulfill his two-year active duty commitment. Rowell, who formerly went by Robinette, had been projected as a mid-round pick and was the first Air Force player ever invited to the East-West Shrine Game, the Senior Bowl and the NFL scouting combine.\n\nQB Trevor Knight \u2014 After playing for three years at Oklahoma under current XFL head coach Bob Stoops, Knight transferred to Texas A&M.\n\nQB Vincent Testaverde \u2014 The son of longtime NFL quarterback Vinny Testaverde had a brief moment in the spotlight this preseason playing for the Buccaneers.\n\nQB Jake Heaps \u2014\u200b Rated the No. 1 pocket passer by Rivals.com out of high school, Heaps signed with BYU in 2010.

He also piloted the Ducks to a Rose Bowl win over Wisconsin the following year, finishing his career with 5,910 passing yards and 66 touchdown throws.", "description": "The XFL kicks off its draft on Tuesday, and the two-day event will feature 71 rounds and picks being made by teams every 90 seconds.", "authors": ["Usa Today Sports", "Published A.M.
