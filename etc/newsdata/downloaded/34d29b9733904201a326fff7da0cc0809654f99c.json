And she had no idea of the nightmare she was about to face in his bungalow.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\u201cI felt sorry for him,\u201d she said of the man who called himself Fred.\n\nHe turned nasty as he massaged her shoulders after a consensual sex act.\n\nBowes produced handcuffs, cuffed her right wrist and tried to strangle her with a ball gag, said the woman.\n\nWhile fighting to escape, terrible thoughts rushed through her mind - the thought of being buried on the Moors and the murder of Middlesbrough girl Vicky Glass.\n\nShe even feared she was being attacked by the then hunted killer of the Ipswich vice girls.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking he was the b*****d who killed the Ipswich girls who went missing and were found, but they had not found the bloke,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to die in that house. I was deliberately leaving DNA all over the place.\"\n\nBowes claimed the woman was lying. But after less than two hours of deliberation, the jury found him guilty of rape and false imprisonment.\n\nIt then came to light that Bowes had been a dangerous sexual predator from a young age.\n\nIn 1968, when he was just 16, he followed a girl of the same age, stabbed her in the back, indecently assaulted her and ran off with her bag.\n\nThen in 1970, he followed and attempted to choke, suffocate or strangle a 21-year-old woman.\n\nAnd in 1981, he was convicted of raping a mum-of-two he lured to the boiler room of an Essex swimming baths, tying her hands and gagging her.\n\nFollowing that conviction he was detained in Rampton - home to some of the country's most dangerous prisoners - before eventually being released from St Luke's Hospital in Middlesbrough.\n\nHe enrolled on a Teesside University course in IT but his twisted nature eventually reared its ugly head again.\n\nThere was no clear evidence of a psychotic disorder, the court had heard, but his crimes might have come from Bowes\u2019 life \u201cunravelling\u201d, along with sexual failings and frustration.\n\nProsecutor David Brooke had told the jury: \"Somewhere deep in this man\u2019s mind, from a young age, is clearly some sort of perverse desire to control, to hurt.\u201d\n\nBowes had been employed as an electrician around the time of the attack, working in the homes of vulnerable single mums.\n\nIn his police interview, Bowes said: \"It\u2019s to do with control. I had the control. I put the handcuffs on, I\u2019m the one who takes them off.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after Bowes was sentenced, his brave victim spoke out and said almost all of the girls she knew working on the streets had been attacked - but next to none reported the crimes.\n\nShe sent a message to other sex workers, urging them to stand up against men like Bowes.\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a prostitute or not. I\u2019m living proof that you can be believed,\" she said.", "description": "David Bowes, 55, had recently fathered a child when he raped his final victim after luring his victim to his bungalow in Middlesborough", "authors": ["Naomi Corrigan", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Gazette Live Ws", "Pa Archive Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20734882.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_David-Bowes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
