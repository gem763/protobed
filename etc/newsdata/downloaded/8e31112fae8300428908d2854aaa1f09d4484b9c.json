I was getting ready for bed and got a message, so I called him straight away, the manager. I couldn\u2019t go to sleep until later.\n\n\u201cI called my mum straight away. I just said \u2018I\u2019m going to Japan today\u2019 and she was just screaming.\u201d\n\nHe replaces highly rated 22-year-old Jacobson, who battled concussion in 2018 and only returned to rugby in March after eight months out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gutted for him, (but) he\u2019ll come back fitter and stronger. At the same time, I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity,\u201d said Frizell, who missed the All Blacks\u2019 final World Cup warmup against Tonga and the previous two tests against Australia.\n\nOverlooked Squire opted out of the southern hemisphere\u2019s Rugby Championship after an injury-blighted Super Rugby season but wrote on social media last month that he was \u201c100% available\u201d if injuries struck the All Blacks.\n\nHansen told reporters at the team\u2019s base in Kashiwa, Japan, that it was still too early for Squire to be considered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happened right at the beginning of the tournament,\u201d he said of Jacobson\u2019s injury.\n\n\u201cSo nothing has changed from that point of view for him.\u201d", "description": "Loose forward Shannon Frizell was surprised and delighted to be summoned to the All Blacks' World Cup squad on Friday, having been wearing a cow-suit at a gym session only hours before the call from the team's staff.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
