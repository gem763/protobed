The company said it initially led a secret investigation to make sure evidence would be preserved \"without interference.\"\n\n\"Moreover, the investigation was significantly drawn out due to the implicated senior executives' lack of cooperation and categorical denial of the allegations, which continues to this day,\" the letter says.\n\nA representative for Brian Kaspar said that Kaspar had cooperated with the company investigation and denied any wrongdoing.

Now, more allegations about the Kaspars are emerging in a 59-page letter from Novartis's AveXis to the FDA, showing a clearer picture of how events unfolded earlier this year.\n\nThe letter was part of a response to the FDA after an FDA inspection found potential violations at AveXis's San Diego laboratory. It includes the allegation that the two execs led the data manipulation in question, and that their non-cooperation and denials delayed AveXis's investigation into the matter.\n\n\"Such conduct is unacceptable, and the two AveXis senior exeuctives have been terminated,\" the letter said.\n\nThe manipulated data was used to secure approval for Zolgensma, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. FDA has said Zolgensma should remain on the market.\n\nRead more: 'Like we were being forced to gamble with our son's life': Health insurers won't pay for a $2.1 million drug for kids, and parents say they're running out of time\n\nA representative for Brian Kaspar said that he had cooperated with the company investigation and denied any wrongdoing, while Allan Kaspar did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment. The FDA has said it could impose civil or criminal penalties.\n\nThe manipulated data was part of a large packet submitted to the FDA and reviewed as part of the drug's approval. The particular issue pertained to data from product testing done in mice, according to the letter and a press release from the FDA last month.\n\nIn addition to the conduct itself, the timeline has also come under scrutiny, since Novartis had knowledge of potential data manipulation issues before Zolgensma was approved in May \u2014 and only disclosed the problem the next month, in June.\n\nRead more: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders just slammed the Swiss drug giant Novartis over a new controversy swirling around the world's most expensive drug\n\nHere's what else we just learned from the letter:", "description": "Novartis blames two brothers who were execs at its AveXis unit.
