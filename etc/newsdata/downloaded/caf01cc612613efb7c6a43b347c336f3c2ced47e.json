It is part of a determination on the left that Trump must be expelled from the White House.\n\nThis coup attempt \u2013 which is exactly what it is \u2013 has nothing to do with evidence or any single accusation. As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said when asked what she would do if the whistleblower accusation involving Ukraine collapsed, \u201cWe have many other, shall we say, candidates for impeachable offense in terms of the Constitution of the United States, but this one is the most understandable by the public.\u201d\n\nIn other words, no matter the evidence and no matter how many times President Trump and his team knock down the attack, there will always be another effort designed to drive him from office.\n\nGREG JARRETT: DID MUELLER LIE TO CONGRESS ABOUT MEETING WITH TRUMP BEFORE HE TOOK THE SPECIAL COUNSEL JOB?\n\nThis \"destroy President Trump\" coup effort developed in the first 24 hours after the 2016 election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016, a left-wing group announced emergency protests against Donald Trump in six cities that day. Within 24 hours of Trump being declared president, left-wing activists were gathering in Chicago, Los Angeles, Sacramento, New York City, San Francisco, and Albuquerque. As the organizers at Act Now to Stop and End Racism (ANSWER) announced:\n\nIn a shock result, Donald Trump has been elected president - but the people can rise up and defeat his bigoted, extreme right-wing agenda! The ANSWER Coalition is mobilizing across the country to organize and take part in emergency actions.\n\nAs one of my colleagues discovered, these gatherings were just the beginning. Below, we\u2019ve compiled a partial list of the first week\u2019s intense reaction from the left.\n\nThe left\u2019s first reaction was simply to protest Trump's election. It was essentially a protest against democracy and our electoral system.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter weeks of sometimes violent protests, the anti-Trump movement realized that simply shouting and causing public nuisance wasn\u2019t going to get them what they wanted. It didn\u2019t take long for the members of the left to find impeachment was the best vehicle for their coup to drive the president from office.\n\nBy Dec. 15, about five weeks after the presidential election and roughly five weeks before the presidential inauguration, Vanity Fair published an article by Emily Jane Fox headlined \u201cDemocrats are Paving the Way to Impeach Donald Trump.\u201d The focus at that phase of the effort was the family business, the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. and possible personal financial improprieties (all of which disappeared within a few weeks and were replaced by \"Russian collusion\" as the focus of Democratic coup efforts).\n\nBy the day of the inauguration, January 20, 2017, the impeachment hunger was great enough that the Washington Post headlined Matea Gold\u2019s article \"The Campaign to Impeach President Trump Has Begun.\"\n\nAs I wrote in my bestselling book, \"Understanding Trump and Trump\u2019s America,\" this effort to drive President Trump from the White House has never been about finding truth. It has always been about subverting the will of the people.\n\nYou are not watching an impeachment process. You are in year three of an attempted coup d\u2019etat, which started the day the president was elected. The evidence is there for anyone who wants to look.\n\nPost-Election Protest Timeline\n\nNovember 9, 2016\n\n\u201cNot Our President\u2019: Protests Erupt Across the Bay Area After Trump\u2019s Stunning Presidential Victory\u201d - NBC Bay Area\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Alaskans Talk Unity, Look Ahead at Candlelit Gathering\u201d - Anchorage Daily News\n\n\u201cThousands Join Anti-Trump Protests Around Country\u201d - ABC 13\n\n\u201cTrump Victory Sets Off Protests On Both Coasts\u201d - CBS Miami\n\n\u201cHundreds Gather in Portland Following Trump\u2019s Victory\u201d - WGME 13\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Demonstrators Take to DC\u2019s Streets\u201d - NBC Washington\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protests in Multiple American Cities Including Winston-Salem\u201d - Fox 8\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump protest takes Tempe streets\u201d - NBC 12\n\n\u201cFires Erupt, Vandalism Reported at Anti-Trump Protest in Oakland\u201d - ABC 7\n\n\u201cThousands Protest Trump Election in LA, Block 101 Freeway Downtown\u201d - ABC7\n\n\u201c\u2018Love Trumps Hate\u2019: Protestors March Through Atlanta After Election\u201d - WXIA\n\n\u201cDonald Trump Victory Sparks Protests in Downtown Detroit\u201d - WXYZ Detroit\n\n\u201cProtests in Major Cities for Second Day After Trump\u2019s Victory\u201d - CBS News\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protests Break At The University Of Michigan\u201d - NBC 6\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters March Through Richmond For 2nd Night\u201d - NBC 12\n\n\u201cNationwide Protests Continue as Obama and Trump Strike Conciliatory Tone\u201d - NBC\n\n\u201cOxnard Students Took To The Streets Protesting Trump\u201d - VC Star\n\n\u201c#NotMyPresident Protests in Downtown Greensboro\u201d - WFMY News\n\n\u201cLouisville\u2019s \u201cNot My President\u201d Protest Wraps Up\u201d - WLKY\n\n\u201cHundreds of Anti-Trump Protesters Close Down I-94 in Minneapolis\u201d - CBS Minnesota\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Demonstrations Continue in Philadelphia for Second Night\u201d - CBS Philly\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters March to Iowa Capital\u201d - The Des Moines Register\n\n\u201cStudents Hold Anti-Trump Protests at Texas State University\u201d - KSAT 12\n\n\u201c\u2018Ignite Your Right: Humanity Against Trump\u2019 Protest Friday at UMass\u201d - Amherst Wire\n\nNovember 11, 2016\n\n\u201cSecond Anti-Trump Protest of The Day Takes to Nashville Streets\u201d \u2013 The Tennessean\n\n\u201cMore North Texas Anti-Trump Protests Planned Tonight\u201d - CBS DFW 11\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters Gather in Downtown Miami, Block Traffic\u201d - CBS Miami\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters Take To The Streets In Grand Rapids\u201d - The Collegiate\n\n\u201cDenver High School Students Walk Out of Class in Anti-Trump Protest\u201d \u2013 The Denver Channel\n\n\u201cVanderbilt Students Protest Trump, Shout \u2018Not My President\u2019\u201d \u2013 The Tennessean\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters Block I-80 in Iowa City\u201d - KCRG\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters Gathered in Southwest Bakersfield Friday\u201d - 23 ABC Bakersfield\n\n\u201c200 Gather In Burlington For Afternoon Anti-Trump Rally\u201d \u2013 The Burlington Free Press\n\n\u201cRound Three of Anti-Trump Protests in Dallas\u201d - WFAA\n\n\u201cDallas And Fort Worth Streets Filled With Anti-Trump Protesters For Third Day\u201d - WFAA\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protests Flare in Large US Cities for 3rd Day\u201d - VOA News\n\n\u201cProtesters in Royal Oak March Against Trump and Bigotry\u201d \u2013 The Detroit Free Press\n\n\u201cDozens Protest in Olympia: \u2018No KKK, No Fascist USA, No Trump\u2019\u201d - My Northwest\n\n\u201cSUNY New Paltz Students Protest Trump Presidency\u201d \u2013 The Times Herald-Record\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protests in Michigan and Around the Nation\u201d - The Detroit News\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protests Held in CT\u201d - Eyewitness News 3\n\nNovember 12, 2016\n\n\u201cNot Their President: UI Students Protest Trump\u2019s Election\u201d - The News Gazette\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump protests at UNCG, UNCW\u201d \u2013 WCNC Greensboro, SC\n\n\u201cStudents Hold Anti-Trump Protest on Campus\u201d - WECT 6 News Wilmington, NC\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protest: Marchers Burn American Flag, Fail to Block Interstate\u201d \u2013 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\n\u201cTrump Protesters Take Over Downtown San Antonio\u201d - My San Antonio\n\n\u201cAnti-Trump Protesters March at VCU: \u2018We Do Not Respect Blatant Sexism\u2019\u201d - CBS 6\n\n\u201cU.S. Protesters March Against Trump Presidency for Fifth Day\u201d - Reuters\n\n\u201c8,000 Anti-Trump Marchers Flood Downtown Los Angeles;
