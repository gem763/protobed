The party did say, however, that Vallance is a long-time Tory supporter and was approached to craft the music.\n\nConservative leader Andrew Scheer stops for a photo while visiting an agricultural fair in St-Hyacinthe, Que., on July 23, 2019. (Paul Chiasson/Canadian Press)\n\nHarrison said the vibe of the song captures the essence of the Conservative message during the election campaign.\n\n\"It's really a reflection of what we've heard from Canadians over the last four years,\" Harrison said. \"Canadians just don't feel like they're getting ahead. They're doing everything right. They're saving. They're paying their bills on time, but they don't have that money at the end of the month to do what they want. They're not able to get ahead.\"\n\nThe Conservatives' economic message\n\nThe Conservative campaign is focused on promoting affordability. It's planning to unveil a number of policies over the next few weeks to show how a Scheer government would more money in people's pockets.\n\nScheer already has announced a government led by him would make Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for new parents tax-free to ease the cost of raising children, remove the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from home heating and energy bills, and establish a single tax return for Quebec that would be administered by the province.\n\nCBC News reached out to the other federal parties to find out what they're using as campaign songs.\n\nThe Liberals say they will unveil their 2019 music during in the coming days and look forward to highlighting the work of Canadian musicians.\n\nThe NDP, Greens, People's Party of Canada and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois did not respond before deadline.\n\nThen-Conservative leader Stephen Harper used 'Better Now' by the American rock band Collective Soul as his campaign song in 2008 and 2015.\n\nThe other leaders in the last campaign kept their music Canadian. Former NDP Leader Tom Mulcair pumped up crowds with 'We're All In This Together' by Montreal's Sam Roberts Band, and Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau rallied to 'The Veldt' by DJ Deadmau5.\n\nHarrison said the Conservatives have 'Get Ahead' blaring in their war room at all hours of the day.\n\n\"We all seem to just enjoy it more and more with every play,\" Harrison said. \"We certainly hope Canadians will feel the same.\"\n\nGot a story? olivia.stefanovich@cbc.ca", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer will unveil his party's first commissioned election song \u2014 called 'Get Ahead' \u2014 when the campaign officially kicks off on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter", "Olivia Stefanovich Is A Senior Reporter For Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau Based In Ottawa.
