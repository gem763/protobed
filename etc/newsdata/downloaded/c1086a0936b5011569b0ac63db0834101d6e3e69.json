(Peter Parks/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s springtime Down Under, and along with overexuberant local football fans, that means another annual menace on Australian streets: angry birds.\n\nSeptember is peak magpie breeding season. And like much of Australia\u2019s native wildlife \u2014 think deadly snakes, spiders and jellyfish \u2014 the country\u2019s magpies are meaner than those found elsewhere. Male birds defending their nests are notorious for attacking people by swooping low at their targets, sometimes striking the heads of perceived intruders with their beaks or claws. They have been known to inflict eye injuries.\n\nCyclists are at particular risk. A 76-year-old man died of serious head injuries on Sunday, police said, after he veered off a path and crashed into a fence post while trying to avoid a swooping magpie south of Sydney.\n\nAustralia\u2019s magpies \u2014 which are not related to the smaller magpies of the Northern Hemisphere \u2014 have become well adapted to urban living, usually nesting high in trees in the country\u2019s suburbs and parks. Although they are a protected species, their actions have brought them into conflict with authorities.\n\nSigns in some areas warn passersby of swooping magpies. Some cyclists fit spikes to their helmets as an extra layer of defense. Local officials in one area of Sydney opted to shoot a particularly troublesome bird recently following dozens of complaints.\n\n\u201cThis bird was very aggressive and uncharacteristically territorial,\u201d the Hills Shire Council said in a statement, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp.\n\nA website, Magpie Alert, allows users to report and share details of magpie attacks. Users have recorded almost 1,700 attacks this year, resulting in roughly 200 injuries. Most incidents take place between August and October, the mating season in most of the country.\n\nOfficials offer advice on how to prevent attacks. The New South Wales state government urges people to \u201cwear a large, wide brim hat and sunglasses or carry an open umbrella\u201d to avoid falling victim to a rogue magpie, and warns that harassing the birds can make them more aggressive.\n\nMagpies are less likely to swoop when a person is looking at them, according to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.\n\n\u201cIf they start acting hostile, try to stay calm. Arm-waving or other erratic behavior will come off as an attack, and the magpie might get more aggressive,\u201d the organization said in a blog post.\n\nThe birds have their defenders, too. They are known for their characteristic song \u2014 a complex, warbling repertoire. And despite their sometimes-aggressive tendencies, the magpie was voted Australia\u2019s \u201cBird of the Year\u201d in a 2017 poll \u2014 ahead of the Australian white ibis and the laughing kookaburra.\n\nThe bird\u2019s name is attached to several Australian rules football clubs in the country, including the Collingwood Magpies , whose fans are often stereotyped as particularly belligerent.\n\nRead more\n\nA man kept one of the \u2018world\u2019s most dangerous\u2019 birds on his farm.
