The lawsuit was originally brought by a coalition of conservative state attorneys general and is backed by the administration. The administration has argued the entire law, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, should be struck down.\n\nIf the court agrees that the law is unconstitutional, an appeal to the Supreme Court in the heart of election season would be likely. To date, administration officials have said the law would remain in place, no matter what the court rules, as the legal process plays out.\n\nRead more on Verma's comments here.\n\nDem presses Verma on Medicaid work requirements\n\nIn another tense exchange at the hearing, Rep.

Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyDemocrats offer cybersecurity bill for 'internet of things' Democrats introduce SWAMP Act to ban meetings with foreign leaders at Trump properties Flight attendant union endorses Markey in Senate primary battle MORE (D-Mass.), said. \"You are imposing policies on millions of people across this country. Can you show me one study that says that is a good policy?\"\n\nKennedy asked Verma if she considers it a \"success\" that so many people have lost their health care.\n\n\"I think it's premature to draw conclusions about Arkansas's program. The program was in effect for 10 months,\" Verma said.\n\nBigger picture: Medicaid work requirements can fall somewhat under the radar given all the news going on, but they are one of the most concrete ways that the Trump administration has changed the health care system.\n\nIn Arkansas, 18,000 people lost Medicaid coverage as a result of the state's work requirements before they were struck down by a federal judge.\n\nRead more here.\n\nRepublican lawmaker tells Zuckerberg Facebook should allow anti-vaccine content\n\nIt was a long day for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he faced a grilling from lawmakers in both parties.

What we do is we try to focus on misinformation that has the potential to lead to physical harm or imminent harm, and that can include especially misleading health advice.\"\n\nPosey also raised debunked concerns about the \"risks of vaccinations,\" and Zuckerberg replied that Facebook allows people to participate in groups and conversations about such topics but does not direct users to those discussions.\n\nRead more about the exchange here.\n\nFLOTUS visits Capitol Hill\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump Melania TrumpMelania Trump breaks ground on new White House tennis pavilion Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Buttigieg unveils aggressive plan to lower drug prices | Supreme Court abortion case poses major test for Trump picks | Trump takes heat from right over vaping crackdown Kroger to stop sales of e-cigarettes at stores MORE visited the Capitol on Wednesday to commemorate the one-year anniversary of her husband signing the Support Act, a law passed by Congress that aimed to make addiction treatment more accessible while cracking down on illicit drugs.\n\n\"I have traveled to some of the areas hardest hit by drug abuse and I have seen the devastating effects that this crisis has on families and children,\" she said, according to pool reports.\n\n\"This is why the Support Act is so important.

The proposed rule would require that appropriate quota reductions be made after estimating the potential for pills to be sold illegally.\n\nThe proposal comes after an internal watchdog report showed the agency allowed drugmakers to increase production of opioids even as overdose deaths were skyrocketing.\n\nRead more on the new policy here.\n\nSponsored Content - Partnership for America's Health Care Future\n\nA new study shows that \"Medicare for America,\" a proposed new government-run health insurance system, could force one-third of American workers off of their current employer provided coverage.
