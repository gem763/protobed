The exhibition opened on Thursday.\n\nThames Valley Police received a report of the burglary at the palace at 4:57 a.m. on Saturday saying that the offenders broke in overnight and left the scene of the crime at 4:50 a.m.\n\n\u201cThe piece of art that has been stolen is a high value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace,\u201d said Detective Inspector Jess Milne of Thames Valley Police.\n\n\u201cDue to the toilet being plumbed in to the building, this has caused significant damage and flooding Milne said in a police statement. \u201cWe believe a group offenders used at least two vehicles during the offense.\u201d\n\nBlenheim Palace issued an official statement on Twitter saying that they are \u201care saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no-one was hurt.\u201d\n\n**OFFICIAL STATEMENT**\n\n\n\nFollowing the Thames Valley Police statement we can confirm \u2018America\u2019, the art piece by Maurizio Cattelan has been stolen in the early hours of this morning.\n\n\n\nWe are saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no-one was hurt. \u2014 Blenheim Palace (@BlenheimPalace) September 14, 2019\n\n\u201cWe knew there was huge interest in the Maurizio Cattelan contemporary art exhibition, with many set to come and enjoy the installations,\u201d the statement said. It\u2019s therefore a great shame an item so precious has been taken.\u201d\n\nVisitors could book a three-minute appointment to use the toilet which had been a popular feature of the exhibition when it was displayed at the Guggenheim in New York City.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that the Guggenheim received a request from the White House to borrow a painting by Vincent Van Gogh but responded by offering up the toilet-- that has been used by more than 100,000 people -- instead.\n\nThames Valley Police say that a 66-year-old man has been arrested in connection with this incident and remains in police custody. The man remains unnamed and any charges he may face have not been disclosed.\n\nEdward Spencer-Churchill, the brother of the Duke of Marlborough who resides at Blenheim Palace, spoke to The Times last month before the theft saying \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the easiest thing to [steal].\u201d\n\n\u201cFirstly it\u2019s plumbed in and secondly a potential thief will have no idea who last used the toilet or what they ate. So no, I don\u2019t plan on guarding it,\u201d said Spencer-Churchill.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
