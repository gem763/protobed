Do you know what the difference between the Bidens and us are? We were international business people before politics, and we gave up doing all new deals going forward. We didn\u2019t become magically international business people because of our political position. We put that all aside.\u201d\n\nThe younger Trump criticized the double standard further, noting the timeline of Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201copportunities\u201d coincided with his father\u2019s political rise.\n\n\u201cNow they do the \u2018family is off-limits,\u2019 \u2018kids are off-limits,'\u201d he added. \u201cHunter Biden is 50. I wasn\u2019t off-limits when it started at 38. Hunter Biden shouldn\u2019t be off-limits now. Baron is 10. They have no problem going after him. They\u2019ve had no problem going after my children as young as four at the time when they started making those comments on my little Chloe. The double standard is despicable.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "During an appearance on Wednesday's broadcast of \"Hannity\" on Fox News Channel, first son Donald Trump, Jr., author of the forthcoming book \"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,\" criticized those comparing him and his siblings' successes to the benefits Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden, had received that have recently come under scrutiny. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/TrumpJr1017-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
