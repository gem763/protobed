With the cameras away after a whirlwind romance, the couple opened up to \u201cGood Morning America\u201d about life post-paradise.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to be able to like just own it, rock the ring and walk around the street and not have to worry about spoiling the show,\u201d said Burnett.\n\nABC/John Fleenor\n\nABC/John Fleenor\n\nThroughout the past season of \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d 24-year-old Burnett struggled openly with her sexuality.\n\nShe told \u201cGMA,\u201d \u201cI think there was just a lot of, like, walls within myself and like a lot of parts of myself that I wasn\u2019t fully in tune with and didn\u2019t really understand.\u201d\n\nIn the season\u2019s first episode, Burnett told her close friend, Hannah Brown, that she was seeing a woman and said that gender did not factor in who she loved.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later on in the season that Burnett revealed Haggerty\u2019s name and that she still had feelings for her. Haggerty felt the same and surprised Burnett in \u201cParadise\u201d -- the two ultimately getting engaged not once on the beach, but twice in another proposal by Haggerty during the show\u2019s reunion episode.\n\nABC/John Fleenor\n\n\u201cI never really watched much of Bachelor Nation or even thought in a million years I\u2019d be on a reality show,\u201d said Haggerty. \u201cI know I\u2019ve said that before in past interviews but I can hands on tell you it was all very real.\u201d\n\nSince the proposal, Burnett and Haggerty have received a lot of praise and support on social media.\n\nWE \ud83d\udc4f HAVE \ud83d\udc4f NO \ud83d\udc4f CHOICE \ud83d\udc4f BUT \ud83d\udc4f TO \ud83d\udc4f STAN \ud83d\udc4f #BachelorInParadise pic.twitter.com/mxttysSn00 \u2014 Brett S. Vergara (@BrettSVergara) September 18, 2019\n\nGLAAD's CEO and president, Sarah Kate Ellis even praised the couple in a statement and said, \"Seeing two women get engaged on Bachelor in Paradise is a groundbreaking step forward toward including LGBTQ couples across reality television. Reality TV is finally moving towards storylines that LGBTQ audiences and allies have been craving for quite some time.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of pressure to be a role model,\u201d said Burnett. \u201cBut I do understand like we are in a sense and if we can make people feel more comfortable with their sexuality like I\u2019m super grateful for that and I\u2019m really proud to be that person.\u201d\n\nNow Haggerty and Burnett are owning their relationship and while they are focusing on building their life together, they are encouraging others who may have been questioning their sexuality to find their truth.\n\nBurnett said, \u201cBe vocal about it. Talk to people you trust about it don\u2019t keep it in your head. Talk about it to people who care about you and love you because that\u2019ll help you.\u201d", "description": "Bachelor Nation's Demi and Kristian open up about being the first LGBTQ couple in", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/152631_6265_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
