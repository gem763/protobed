They're shutting it off, they are not taking it as seriously as they should and I ask you, do you think you're part of that problem?\"\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP CALLS ON UKRAINE AND CHINA TO INVESTIGATE THE BIDENS\n\nCo-host Joy Behar, with a surprised look on her face, asked \"Rachel?!\" while putting her hand on the MSNBC host's shoulder.
