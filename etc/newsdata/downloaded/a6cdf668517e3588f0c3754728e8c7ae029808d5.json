My advice is to be inconspicuous, and if you want to see rutting deer in action then take binoculars.'\n\nMr Curtis said dog owners should avoid the parks during the rutting season and advise photographers to use long lens cameras to stay out of danger.\n\nMr Curtis added: 'Approaching wild deer at any time of year is unwise but during rutting season it\u2019s downright dangerous. Putting yourself, child or dog near a 25 stone stag with sharp antlers, is extremely risky. Being hit by a stag running at full speed of 30 miles an hour is the equivalent of being mown down by a motorbike.'", "description": "The large rutting stag gored the side of a white Fiat Panda as it drove slowly through Richmond Park, south-west London last weekend.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/13/19441722-0-image-a-38_1570538551799.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
