And hundreds of billions of dollars of such transactions are conducted globally each year, including transactions involving U.S. companies and their subsidiaries. General Electric and Goldman Sachs issued sukuk bonds. Do you want a mortgage that is Sharia-compliant?

The result is extreme uncertainty, which likely costs the U.S. government critical tax revenue and leaves both taxpayers and regulators confused. Uncertainty also limits the role of U.S. financial institutions in the growing field of Sharia-compliant finance.\n\nMost Americans cannot explain Sharia law. But many know they don\u2019t like it. Concerns arise primarily because of perceptions and misperceptions of what Sharia law says about women and the structure of families. But in the field of finance, the principles of Sharia that have emerged over eight centuries are not controversial.\n\nFour principles take center stage: No payments of interest or unacceptably high profits; risks should be shared and not shifted entirely to another party; no excessive uncertainty or speculation; and no investments in unethical goods or activities, such as alcohol or gambling.\n\nA challenge arises when businesses want to borrow money or finance sales and still stay true to Sharia principles. Not many lenders provide funds interest-free. So the Islamic finance industry developed techniques to provide financing while staying sufficiently true to Sharia principles.\n\nTransactions typically involve extra parties and extra steps, compared to conventional financing. In a typical ijarah financing, the buyer and seller interpose a financial institution into the transaction. The seller sells equipment or a building to the bank, which then leases the item to the purchaser. The purchaser pays \u201crent\u201d with an option to purchase the item later for a nominal fee.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHow should the transaction be characterized for U.S. tax purposes? The rent is economically equivalent to interest, or to interest plus principal. But the payment is denominated as rent. Federal tax law limits the deductibility of interest but generally does not limit deductions for rent. Will the buyer treat the payment as rent or as interest? Does the form or the substance of the transaction control the consequences?\n\nThere is no IRS guidance. And in the absence of guidance, taxpayers may whipsaw the government, reporting based on the substance of the transaction when that is beneficial, and reporting based on the form when that gives a better result. Like the taxation of cryptocurrencies and digital services, the absence of clear rules invites taxpayers to choose whichever approach serves them best.\n\nMany countries, both large (the United Kingdom) and small (Morocco), provide guidance on Sharia-compliant transactions. The lack of guidance here is not a minor irritant; it is a major gap. In the U.K., the leading dispute on Islamic finance transactions took 10 years to resolve before guidance was issued. The United States should avoid that same path.\n\nA decade ago, a taxpayer sought an IRS ruling on the tax treatment of a mortgage program that followed Sharia principles. The IRS refused to rule. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved Sharia-compliant mortgage programs in 1997 and 1999, but the IRS lags behind.\n\nDespite the toxic view many Americans hold toward Sharia law, the principles of Sharia are followed in financial transactions every day. U.S. multinational companies engage in these matters, both directly and through foreign affiliates. Banks have Islamic finance departments. And ordinary Americans buy homes with mortgages that are Sharia-compliant.\n\nThe United States and the IRS will be better served by acknowledging these transactions and providing guidance on how to treat them under our law, rather than pretending Sharia-compliant finance lies wholly outside our shores.\n\nPeter Barnes is an of counsel tax attorney at the law firm Caplin & Drysdale.
