His written response, which was released by his office, made no mention of the violence.\n\nSpanish media reported that Torra tried to talk to Sanchez by telephone on both Saturday and Sunday, but was rebuffed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"DISRESPECT\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the pro-independence party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), which is allied with Torra's group, condemned the prime minister on Monday for not talking directly to the Catalan government.\n\n\"Sanchez is refusing dialogue for the umpteenth time. (This shows) disrespect to the people of Catalonia,\" Marta Vilalta Torres said.\n\nSanchez will visit injured police officers and meet security forces, the government said. The interior ministry said on Sunday that 288 police had been hurt in the clashes and 194 people arrested.\n\nThe unrest in Catalonia comes as political parties in Spain gear up for a snap national election on Nov. 10, the second vote this year.\n\nThe issue of Catalan separation has dominated the country's fractured political debate in recent years and is likely to continue to do so in the run-up to next month's ballot.\n\nSpain's main parties have consistently refused to hold an independence referendum in Catalonia, although the ruling Socialists say they are open to dialogue on other issues.\n\nAdding to political tensions, the government announced on Monday that the body of former dictator General Francisco Franco would be exhumed on Thursday from a state mausoleum that the Socialists and others have criticized as a monument to fascism.\n\nAlthough four decades have passed since the end of Franco's rule, he remains a highly contentious figure in Spain.\n\nThe Catalan separatists have evoked Franco's name in their criticism of the Madrid government's handling of the independence crisis.\n\n(Reporting by Bel\u00e9n Carre\u00f1o and Jessica Jones; Writing by Ashifa Kassam; Editing by Edmund Blair and Crispian Balmer)", "description": "Spain's acting prime minister accused Catalonia's pro-seccession president of failing in his duty to ensure public order and peace between pro and anti-indepedence supporters as he visited regional capital Barcelona on Monday following a week of riots.
