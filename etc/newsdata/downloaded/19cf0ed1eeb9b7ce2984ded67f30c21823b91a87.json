Under the policy, working parents who earn up to \u00a3100,000 each are entitled to 30 hours of free childcare for three to four-year-olds, which is double the 15 hours they were previously entitled to.\n\nThe multi-billion pound taxpayer funded scheme, which came into force in September 2017, was aimed at encouraging parents to get back into work rather than getting put off by prohibitive childcare costs.\n\nBut Mr Leitch said that the policy is bankrupting nurseries because the hourly rate they are paid by the Government is far below their true cost, while other costs have increased.\n\n\u201cBusiness rates and the national minimum wage have increased,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have a hike in the minimum wage, it does impact us because a huge amount of our workforce is on minimum wage, it has a disproportionate effect on a sector that is really low paid. If the Government doesn\u2019t change what it pays you someone has to pick up the tab.\u201d", "description": "Over 500 nurseries and childminders are closing every month, figures show as business rates and childcare policies are blamed.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Allister Heath", "David Goodhart", "Judith Woods"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/education/2017/04/19/TELEMMGLPICT000123246373-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
