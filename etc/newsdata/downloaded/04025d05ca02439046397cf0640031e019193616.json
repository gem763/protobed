This could potentially bring a new scale and scope to the space, which the financial regulatory community must carefully consider. Quarles stated:\n\n\u201cAlthough there is a small risk to financial stability today, there is no doubt the potential scale of stablecoins and other crypto-assets yet to emerge may pose regulatory challenges.\u201d\n\nThe G7 is currently finishing a preliminary investigation into stablecoins, and the G20 has asked the FSB to lead this initiative going forward.\n\nFSB pivots from reactive to proactive efforts\n\nThe FSB, like Bitcoin, was created in the wake of the 2008 global financial crash, aiming to implement standards that could ensure that such an event could never happen again.\n\nNow 10 years old, the board believes that the reforms it has introduced have led to a stronger, more resilient global financial system, which will reduce the likelihood and severity of potential future crises.\n\nThe United States House Financial Services Committee has reportedly also requested that Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, gives his testimony on Libra before January 2020.", "description": "Stablecoins could pose \u201cregulatory challenges,\u201d says Randall Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board", "authors": ["Jack Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMmU5MzEyNDc2YWNkNGE1Nzg0MDAwNGRkZmFjMTNmY2EuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
