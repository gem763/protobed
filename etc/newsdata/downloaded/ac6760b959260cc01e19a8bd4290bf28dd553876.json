REUTERS/Hannah McKay\n\nWhile almost all British politicians agree that an election is needed, they want to inflict maximum political damage on Johnson - who leads in opinion polls - by preventing his last-minute deal from being ratified before the poll.\n\nJohnson, in turn, is trying to shift the blame for failing to deliver Brexit by Oct. 31 onto parliament.\n\n\u201cWe have a great new deal, and it\u2019s time for the voters to have a chance to pronounce on that deal, and to replace this dysfunctional parliament with a new parliament that can get Brexit done so the country can move on,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nBritain\u2019s departure has already been delayed twice - from March 29 and April 12 - after Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get her deal ratified by parliament.\n\nIn a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk, Johnson reluctantly accepted the delay agreed in Brussels, saying he had no choice under British law.\n\n\u201cThis unwanted prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU is damaging to our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would also urge EU member states to make clear that a further extension after 31st January is not possible. This is plenty of time to ratify our deal.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (9 Images)\n\nIf no EU country objects within 24 hours - by Tuesday afternoon - the delay will have been formally adopted.\n\nThe EU, forged from the ruins of World War Two as a way to prevent another ruinous conflict in Europe, is fatigued by Britain\u2019s protracted crisis but keen not to be held responsible for an economically tumultuous \u201cno-deal\u201d rupture.", "description": "The European Union agreed to a Brexit delay of up to three months on Monday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would push on with his bid to end Britain's political paralysis with an election on Dec. 12.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445937559&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1HD", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
