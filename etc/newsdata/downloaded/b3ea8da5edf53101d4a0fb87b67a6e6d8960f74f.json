It also asks the court to order a \"permanent injunction staying the subpoena while the president is in office.\" Trump's lawyers also claimed that Vance was running a \"harassment\" campaign against the president.\n\nTrump attorney Marc Mukasey told Fox News that \"We are in court to protect the President's rights and the Constitution.\"\n\nVance has until the close of business Monday to file a response to Trump's motion for a temporary restraining order, and Trump's legal team must reply by the end of the day Tuesday. Both sides are scheduled to appear for oral arguments Wednesday morning. In the meantime, Vance has agreed \"to stay enforcement of and compliance with the subpoena\" issued to Mazars LLP.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the constitutional issues at stake in this case will receive the appropriate review from the District Court,\" Trump's legal team told Fox News.\n\nThursday's developments came after Mazars chief marketing officer Jennifer Farrington told Fox News Monday that they had \u201creceived a subpoena\u201d as part of Vance\u2019s investigation, but would not provide further details.\n\nIn a statement, Mazars said the firm will \u201crespect the legal process and fully comply with its legal obligations.\u201d\n\nThe firm added: \u201cWe believe strongly in the ethical and professional rules and regulations that govern our industry, our work and our client interactions. As a matter of firm policy and professional rules, we do not comment on the work we conduct for our clients.\u201d\n\nThe subpoenas to Mazars were reportedly issued late last month after the district attorney\u2019s office opened a criminal investigation into the role that the president and The Trump Organization played in hush-money payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFormer Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen orchestrated a payment of $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who said she had a sexual encounter with the president in 2006, in the weeks prior to the election. The president had reimbursed Cohen for the money paid, but denied the alleged affair, saying that the payments were personal matters, not campaign expenses.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations, tax evasion, and other crimes and is currently serving a three-year sentence in federal prison.\n\nIn a separate case, the president sued the House Ways and Means Committee and New York state officials in July for employing an \"unconstitutional\" law to obtain his state tax returns, after the Treasury Department's move to block his federal records from release.\n\nTRUMP SUES HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, NEW YORK STATE OFFICIALS TO PROTECT HIS TAX RETURNS\n\nThe suit was filed by the president, \"in his capacity as a private citizen,\" in Washington D.C. federal court against the committee, New York State Attorney General Letitia James and commissioner of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance Michael Schmidt.\n\nThat lawsuit came after the committee chairman, Richard Neal, D-Mass., earlier this month sued the Trump administration, accusing officials of violating federal law by refusing to comply with the panel's requests and subpoenas for the documents.\n\nDays later, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law, titled the TRUST Act, which would allow lawmakers on Capitol Hill to obtain Trump\u2019s state tax returns. Under previous law, however, state tax returns were required to remain private with an exception for law enforcement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe president\u2019s lawsuit in July also claimed that the new law was \"unconstitutional\" and \u201cviolates the First Amendment,\u201d saying it was enacted \u201cto discriminate and retaliate against President Trump for his speech and politics.\u201d\n\nThe filing also claimed that the new law was part of \u201ca larger campaign in New York to uncover and expose the President\u2019s private financial information in the hopes of damaging him politically.\u201d\n\nFox News' John Roberts and Marta Dhanis contributed to this report.", "description": "President Trump filed a lawsuit against his own accounting firm, Mazars USA, and Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance in federal court on Thursday in an effort to protect his tax returns from release.", "authors": ["Brooke Singman", "Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News.
