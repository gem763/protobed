It was the day that I arrived at the Iraqi-Syrian border crossing of Fishkhabour.\n\nWith shocked, sunburnt faces, men, women and children in dirt-caked clothes were struggling in temperatures of over 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit), waiting patiently for local Kurdish aid.\n\nAt first, I focused my camera on a group of women sitting on the ground, but when I turned away I saw this little girl.\n\nI took one shot of her there and as she saw me, she gave me a smile. I captured another frame of her with her mother.\n\nI was drawn to her wild beauty in this terrible situation. There is a kind of intensity, distress and sadness in her eyes.\n\nI know that she is 6 years old because I asked her mother, but unfortunately I didn\u2019t ask for her name. The family was coming from the Iraqi town of Sinjar, fleeing Islamic State militants.\n\nIt was really sad not only to see this girl, but also to see the hundred others who were dirty, exhausted, and sitting amongst garbage in the heat.\n\nI have been in Iraq for over a week now. It\u2019s my first time in the country, and though I have been to many conflict zones, nothing compares to seeing these displaced people.\n\nI wonder what their state of mind can be as they walk for miles and hours through the mountains with a few of their belongings.\n\nI would be very curious to see the blonde girl who I photographed again. I wonder what will become of her. I wonder what will become of all the others.", "description": "With piercing eyes gazing out from under a shock of blonde hair, a young Yazidi girl rests at a border crossing between Iraq and Syria.", "authors": ["Youssef Boudlal"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ8JJap0vgx12WObCOo0PqpAPI3LSlPYYXFSvNiQnxO7T8DbYfByR34GyjJc-ZrrJN5iohbWe1hGoK0Ji81ajvpJjXKndutBC-oIzKZUPlXEy"}
