RATP meanwhile was offering free 30-minute rides on the Cityscoot network of electric mopeds.\n\nParis has about 20,000 electric scooters available for hire.\n\nWhy is the pension reform controversial?\n\nRATP's three main unions have called the strike a \"shot across the bow\" for Mr Macron's reform plans.\n\nMetro workers say the new universal pension would force them to work longer by taking away their right to retire early, negotiated decades ago to compensate for having to work long hours underground.\n\nOn average, Metro workers retire at 55 while most French workers retire at 63.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The busy R\u00e9publique metro station was closed\n\nThe move to a universal points-based pension system would also remove the most advantageous pensions for a range of jobs ranging from sailors to notaries and including Paris opera workers.\n\nMeanwhile those retiring before 64 would receive a lower pension. For example someone retiring at 63 would receive five percent less.\n\nOn Thursday French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe insisted the reforms would be fair for everyone.\n\n\"We're going to construct a truly universal system where every euro paid in will provide the same rights for everyone, whether a labourer, a shop owner, a researcher, a farmer, a civil servant, a doctor or an entrepreneur,\" he said.\n\nThe French government wants parliament to vote on the plans early next year.\n\nLast year lawmakers overwhelmingly voted in favour of overhauling rail operator SNCF, which saw employees lose generous job and pension guarantees. That followed months of rolling strikes by SNCF workers.", "description": "Most metro lines are not running amid union resistance to President Macon's reform plans.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4947/production/_108795781_mediaitem108795780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
