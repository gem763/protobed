I\u2019m grateful for all the ears and all the hearts. Thank you!!\u2019\n\nPerhaps someone from her team sent that out? Wouldn\u2019t be that weird if this was the case and Pink still was none the wiser.\n\nOther fans were just loving her nonchalant view of the whole chart success thing.\n\n\u2018Because you\u2019re so fierce you don\u2019t need chart validation. You\u2019re Midas with your music and performances,\u2019 one responded, as another fan chimed in: \u2018And I thought I can\u2019t love you more.\u2019\n\nNo one even told me that album was #1. https://t.co/Kk3F2JFnRj \u2014 P!nk (@Pink) October 6, 2019\n\nThis album was Pink\u2019s first number one album, and she went on to grab another two in the years since with 2017\u2019s Beautiful Trauma and this year\u2019s Hurts 2B Human also topped the competition.\n\nIf you were wondering, Funhouse got to number two, so, you know, close.\n\nThe superstar has been reliving some epic moments from her career this week, after she shared an epic shot from one of her recent tour dates.\n\nShe\u2019s still flying about the place (Picture: AFP)\n\nThe Just Give Me A Reason singer graced the stage at the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Saturday to headline this year\u2019s installment of Rock In Rio. And it\u2019s safe to say that Pink got the party started and delivered a standout performance thanks to her dizzying acrobatics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter being suspended in the air, Pink was seen dangling from a particularly large chandelier with seemingly no fear whatsoever. She then looped her legs into a hoop and hung upside down all the while still managing to sing.\n\nFollowing the incredible performance, Pink posted on Instagram: \u2018That\u2019s me up top, 100,000 strong tonight. My heart is so full Rio. Thank you for having this lady as your headliner this year.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been waiting to meet you all for a long long time. I love y\u2019all.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
