James Vick at UFC on ESPN+ 19: Best photos view 12 images\n\nKnown for his creative violence, Niko Price did not disappoint Saturday night.\n\nAt UFC on ESPN+ 19, Price (13-3 MMA, 5-3 UFC) crumpled opponent James Vick (13-4 MMA, 9-4 UFC) with a brutal upkick knockout in the first round of their welterweight contest.\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 took place Saturday at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla. The card streamed on ESPN+.\n\nAfter absorbing some hard shots from \u201cThe Texecutioner \u201d on the canvas, the home crowd favorite Price improvised and sent his foot toward the chin of Vick. A bone-chilling thud sounded as his foot hit Vick flush on the face.\n\nVick\u2019s bloody, unconscious body crumpled onto Price, who landed a few short shots to his already out opponent. Referee Herb Dean stepped in and waived off the contest 1:44 into the opening frame.\n\nCheck out Niko Price\u2019s brutal knockout of James Vick in the video below:\n\nThe victory was a rebound for Price, who was defeated in his previous fight in July against Geoff Neal.\n\nBetween his four UFC performance bonuses, his crazy hammerfist-from-guard knockout of Randy Brown, to his ridiculous come-from-behind knockout of Tim Means, \u201cThe Hybrid\u201d has become appointment viewing.\n\nThe Blue Corner is MMA Junkie\u2019s blog space.
