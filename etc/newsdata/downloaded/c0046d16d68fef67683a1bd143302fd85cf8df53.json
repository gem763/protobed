My maiden name is Smith \u2013 and as mundane as it is, it\u2019s my identity and the name I use for my work as a journalist.\n\nIn the run-up to our wedding, though, my now-husband and I decided we wanted to share a last name. We agreed that the fairest way to do that was to double-barrel, but something was holding me back from sticking with Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was born in the UK but half of my family is Polish and I grew up surrounded by the culture. Birthdays, Christmases and Easter were loud and busy and until she passed away in 2016, my Polish grandmother lived with us \u2013 and was a huge influence on my life.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying I\u2019m British \u2013 I was born in Bradford, I have a UK passport, I love tea and I hate hugs. But I also identify strongly with the Polish side of my family and over the past few years \u2013 particularly since the EU referendum \u2013 I\u2019ve grown protective of it.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing sense that you\u2019re being told to hide your background for fear of offending someone, which only encourages me to make my heritage more visible with my name.\n\nSo I decided to use my mother\u2019s Polish maiden name in my half of the barrel, to keep my family\u2019s Polish surname going.\n\nXenophobia is on the rise. In August, a study by the University of Strathclyde found that 77 per cent of Eastern European pupils in England and Scotland said they had suffered racism, xenophobia or bullying.\n\nOf the pupils surveyed, 49 per cent said the attacks had become more frequent since the EU referendum in 2016.\n\nAlthough there are many reasons behind the decision, it also feels a little cathartic to visibly display this part of my heritage despite the rising intolerance Eastern Europeans and many others are experiencing. It feels right to recognise this side of my family and keep their history alive, albeit in a small way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m proud of my heritage \u2013 all of it. I grew up in Yorkshire, partly in an industrial town, but mostly in a village surrounded by beautiful countryside and rolling hills.\n\nBut I was also brought up surrounded by my Polish family and I\u2019m proud of that, too. And so for my husband and I, reflecting this in our surname is the right decision for us, even if it\u2019s a little unusual.\n\nYour name or what language you speak shouldn\u2019t be political but they are. My mum and I often speak English with a smattering of Polish \u2013 useful if you want to have a moan about someone on the sly \u2013 but in recent months, I\u2019ve noticed people glancing over with a look and I can sense judgement.\n\nThere\u2019s a growing sense that you\u2019re being told to hide your background for fear of offending someone, which only encourages me to make my heritage more visible with my name.\n\nOf course, this pales in comparison with the abuse, harassment and violence many people are subjected to, but it\u2019s a small indicator of a very big problem.\n\nUltimately, what you choose to do with your name is a hugely personal decision. For some women, changing their surname at all is a complete no-no \u2013 after all, it once symbolised the traditional transfer of \u2018ownership\u2019 from father to husband.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor others, sharing a last name is about family, legacy and uniting identities.\n\nWhatever women decide to do, they should be able to without fear of judgement from others. After all, it\u2019s your name \u2013 any decision is the right decision.\n\nMORE: I\u2019m Polish and despite Brexit I\u2019m not leaving the UK\n\nMORE: Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Shirley Ballas was convinced breast implants would \u2018save\u2019 her marriage to ex-husband\n\nMORE: Wheel of Fortune contestant jokes he\u2019s trapped in a loveless marriage and becomes viral sensation\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "There\u2019s no denying I\u2019m British - I was born in Bradford, I have a UK passport...but I also identify strongly with my Polish side.", "authors": ["Lydia Antonik-Yates"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/LydiaLuke-f8a7-e1571566076122_1572270671.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
