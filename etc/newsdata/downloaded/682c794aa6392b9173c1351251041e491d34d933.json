A lunch of perfectly moist roast beef, paired with towering piles of crispy roast potatoes and doused in home-made gravy. For many, these are key ingredients to a perfect Sunday.\n\nBut in recent years, mounting evidence has suggested these simple pleasures, enjoyed too often, could wreak havoc on our health.\n\nA series of studies have raised the alarm over red meat, particularly processed meat, linking it to bowel and colon cancers.\n\nIn 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified processed red meat \u2013 including sausages, bacon, ham and p\u00e2t\u00e9 \u2013 as a \u2018definite\u2019 cause of cancer, alongside cigarettes.\n\nThe World Cancer Research Fund advises eating \u2018little, if any\u2019 processed meat such as bacon and sausages, and only \u2018moderate\u2019 amounts of beef, pork and lamb.\n\nA series of studies have raised the alarm over red meat, particularly processed meat, linking it to bowel and colon cancers\n\nThe NHS, too, recommends no more than 70g of cooked or processed meat every day \u2013 equivalent to one-and-a-half pork sausages, two rashers of bacon or one third of an average-sized sirloin steak. But will busting that limit put us on a fast-track to cancer?\n\nThe answer is probably not.\n\nThe current advice stems from a 2010 report by the Government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.\n\nScientists analysed evidence provided by hundreds of studies that had looked at the relationship between meat and cancer since the 1970s, involving millions of participants around the world.\n\nTheir conclusion, based on the analysed research, was that we should err on the side of caution and stick to 70g daily.\n\nBut many of the research included was flawed, leading even the committee itself to state: \u2018Although a number of plausible biological mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association between red meat and colorectal cancer risk, none is supported by convincing evidence.\u2019\n\nSome studies did not distinguish between the effects of eating red meat \u2013 a steak, mince or a leg of lamb \u2013 and processed meat.\n\nOthers drew on dietary habits from outside of the UK where meat production \u2013 and ingredients in products \u2013 can be vastly different.\n\nWorld Health Organisation data shows the colorectal cancer risk is 1.18 times higher if you eat 50 grams of processed red meat every day \u2013 roughly two slices of bacon. But the risk of any cancer is 40 times higher if you smoke, and 70 times higher for those who smoke and drink. (File photo)\n\nAnd then there is the problem in the way the evidence is gathered.\n\nDiet studies rely on participants remembering and then reporting what they\u2019ve eaten over the course of a month or year \u2013 which is, for obvious reasons, unreliable.\n\nAnd, most diets contain a huge variety of foods. So even after making complicated statistical adjustments, it is difficult to determine how any one thing has an effect.\n\nOther studies have shown that, for instance, men who eat a lot of meat are also less likely to eat vegetables and fruit, and more likely to engage in other, unhealthy behaviours such as smoking and drinking alcohol.\n\nRED MEAT CAN POSE A RISK \u2013 BUT IT'S SMALL\n\nSo are all the concerns simply misguided, nannying rubbish? Well, not entirely. There is some legitimate concern over the link between processed red meat \u2013 bacon, ham and such like \u2013 and the risk of bowel cancer.\n\nThe issue is thought to lie with chemicals called nitrates that are added to meat products in order to lengthen their shelf life. Once inside the stomach, these react with bacteria to form nitrosamines, which are known to be involved in the development of bowel cancers.\n\nA Cancer Research UK study of half a million adults, published in the European Journal Of Epidemiology in April, found that those who ate the most processed meat were 20 per cent more likely to get bowel cancer than those who ate the least.\n\nMediterranean diets high in fresh fish, nuts, fruit, vegetables and olive oil can cut the risk of breast cancer. Coffee contains cancer-causing acrylamide \u2013 but only 1-2 micrograms per cup. Below 208 micrograms daily is safe.\n\nBut it is worth putting this into context. Last year, Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King\u2019s College London, told us: \u2018Only one in a hundred cases of colorectal cancer is said to be related to processed red meat compared to 64,500 cancers a year caused by smoking.\u2019\n\nWorld Health Organisation data shows the colorectal cancer risk is 1.18 times higher if you eat 50 grams of processed red meat every day \u2013 roughly two slices of bacon. But the risk of any cancer is 40 times higher if you smoke, and 70 times higher for those who smoke and drink.\n\nIt all means that on a population level, if every person eats lots of processed meat, it would result in a significant number of extra cancer cases. But for an individual, the risk is small.\n\nAnd this is precisely the point of the highly controversial study on meat published last week.\n\nAlthough the research, published in Annals Of Internal Medicine, concluded that eating just under two bacon rashers every day for most of your life is likely to increase the risk of colorectal cancer, the evidence isn\u2019t strong enough to warrant cutting back significantly. The benefits of cutting back \u2013 the scientists suggest \u2013 are \u2018trivial\u2019.\n\nDiet studies rely on participants remembering and then reporting what they've eaten over the course of a month or year \u2013 which is, for obvious reasons, unreliable. And, most diets contain a huge variety of foods. So even after making complicated statistical adjustments, it is difficult to determine how any one thing has an effect\n\nThe report recommends that eating up to four portions of red or processed meat every week poses no risk \u2013 contrary to almost every other guideline from official health bodies around the world.\n\nPharmacologist David Colquhoun, a professor at University College London, adds: \u2018We have no absolute proof that meat causes cancer.\n\n\u2018To get that, we\u2019d need to lock people away on a closed ward and feed them a high meat diet for their entire lives to see what happened to them.\u2019\n\nProf Colquhoun says the risk posed by red meat specifically has decreased as the evidence has mounted over the years. \u2018The EPIC study in 2013, which followed nearly half a million people over more than 12 years, found red meat posed no detectable risk of death. The increased risk was about two per cent.\u2019\n\nThere are now important questions over whether the evidence from studies \u2013 however weak \u2013 might point to there solely being a risk from processed meat.\n\nWriting in 2017 in the British Medical Bulletin, Dr Ian Johnson, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience, said: \u2018The evidence for an association with colorectal is stronger for processed meat than for red meat, and indeed some still argue that the evidence in relation to red meat remains too weak and inconsistent to justify a conclusion.\u2019\n\nSo, risk-averse types might simply choose to neglect the odd sausage or slice of bacon. But forgoing your Sunday roast or the odd bacon sandwich? That\u2019s just silly.\n\nFruit and veg are good - but you don't need to overdo it Guidelines recommend eating five portions of fruit and veg every day. And most surveys suggest we are actually doing pretty well already, with the average Briton consuming four portions a day. But might that be too little? Recent research suggested we may need to double our efforts to protect against cancer and early death. A major study from experts at Imperial College London suggested that ten portions a day reduced the risk of cancer overall by 13 per cent. If we all did it, millions of lives could be saved, it was claimed. So what is it about munching through vast quantities of veg that has this magical effect? Hilary Powers, emeritus professor of nutritional biochemistry at Sheffield University, says the main message is that 'eating some fruit and veg is better than none' According to the World Cancer Research Fund, fruit and non-starchy vegetables contain compounds such as fibre, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, that have the potential to fight tumours. But it is hard to actually know if this is the reason lower cancer rates are seen in people who eat lots of them. A recent Cambridge study of more than 50,000 British households found that people with more money spent more on \u2018healthier\u2019 foods \u2013 rather than those which are high in calories, fats, refined starches and sugars \u2013 and bought more fruit and vegetables. By contrast, those with less to spend bought less fresh fruit and veg and more high-fat, high-sugar, high-calorie foods. And it\u2019s been shown in many studies that those who are better off are more likely to do other things that are healthy, such as exercise, and not smoke or drink too much. Interestingly, findings from an ongoing European study that is tracking nearly half a million people to investigate the relationships between diet, lifestyle and cancer found that those who followed a pescatarian diet \u2013 eating fish but not meat \u2013 had a lower colorectal cancer risk compared to people who were completely veggie and those who ate meat, but not much fish. In veggies and omnivores, the risk of colorectal cancer did not differ. So it could be fish that\u2019s protective. Hilary Powers, emeritus professor of nutritional biochemistry at Sheffield University, says the main message to take away is that \u2018eating some fruit and veg is better than none\u2019. She adds: \u2018It\u2019s important to understand that eating some fruit and vegetables each day, rather than none at all, can significantly reduce the risk of some cancers.\u2019\n\nDON'T STOP ENJOYING YOUR CRISPY ROASTIES\n\nThe gnarly, crisp ridges of a roast potato are, according to many, the best part of a Sunday roast.\n\nFor many, it\u2019s a case of the browner, the better.\n\nBut a preference for overdone roasties could leave you privy to \u2018toxic cancer agents\u2019, some reports would have you believe. In 2017, following a series of studies, the Food Standards Agency warned of the possible risks involved with over-cooking foods, particularly those high in starch.\n\nThe concerns related, specifically, to roasted potatoes, burnt toast and frozen chips.\n\nThe watchdog encouraged us to \u2018go for golden\u2019 after research found high levels of the chemical acrylamide \u2013 a known carcinogen \u2013 in foods that are burned or over-cooked. The chemical is formed when compounds in these foods \u2013 water, sugar and amino acids \u2013 combine together when heated at high temperatures.\n\nScientists have shown that mice which had been fed large doses of acrylamide develop multiple tumours.\n\nAnd this led to the World Health Organisation labelling acrylamide as a \u2018probable carcinogen\u2019.\n\nThe gnarly, crisp ridges of a roast potato are, according to many, the best part of a Sunday roast. For many, it's a case of the browner, the better. But a preference for overdone roasties could leave you privy to 'toxic cancer agents', some reports would have you believe. File image\n\nBut according to the European Food Safety Authority, its ruling may be over-cautious.\n\nFirst of all, there are many everyday substances that are considered a \u2018probable carcinogen\u2019, including hot drinks. The only confirmed link between acrylamide and tumours is in animals alone.\n\nAnd the amount of acrylamide seen to be harmful was the equivalent of eating at least 40 slices of burned toast per day, for a number of weeks.\n\nToxicology studies have shown that humans and rodents absorb acrylamide at different rates, and process it differently.\n\nOne such study, from 2009, published in the journal Food And Chemical Toxicology, suggested that humans quickly process and excrete any acrylamide we eat, which protects against negative effects.\n\nA 2015 Italian review of research, which examined links between acrylamide and 14 different types of cancer, found \u2018no meaningful association\u2019 with most cancer types, apart from a \u2018modest association\u2019 \u2013 and remember, this doesn\u2019t equate to cause and effect \u2013 with kidney, endometrial and ovarian cancers.\n\n\u2018The evidence linking acrylamide to cancer is weak and inconsistent,\u2019 says Katie Parker, from Cancer Research UK.\n\n\u2018The likelihood of eating so much burnt toast that it significantly impacts on your cancer risk is very, very small.\u2019", "description": "WHO data shows the risk of colorectal cancer is 1.18 times higher if you eat 50g of processed red meat per day.
