We sell very much directly to the English public and quite locally,\u201d she told AFP.\n\nBut even with no customs duties to pay or headaches at the border, Brexit can deliver an unexpected bite.\n\n\u201cI think for the farming community, Brexit will have quite a negative impact,\u201d said Woodcock, who co-manages Brambletye Farm, near East Grinstead, in Sussex.\n\n\u201cThe farming community around here really rely on foreign workers, so changes to the legislation and people movement could really affect them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one positive thing that I can spring out of it, even if I was to twist my mind,\u201d added co-owner Stein Leenders, as he harvested the final fruits of the season.\n\n\u2013 Rising overheads \u2013\n\nBrambletye grows apples, pears, raspberries and blackberries, and sells eggs laid by dozens of free-range chickens over its nearly 45 acres (18 hectares) of land.\n\nWoodcock, Leenders and their 20-odd employees make or grow virtually everything on site, including fruit purees and bottled juice from a shed housing three busy workers.\n\n\u201cSome of the supplies I might buy from other European countries directly or indirectly through a third party,\u201d said Woodcock.\n\n\u201cOne of them would be corks. I also buy mushroom substrate, which comes directly from Holland.\u201d\n\nSuch products risk becoming more expensive because of Brexit, which has both made the pound weaker since the 2016 referendum and upped expectations of disruption at the border.\n\nWhere Brambletye has opted to focus on a few products, other smallholders bring in fruit from Spain, Portugal and other sunnier European countries to sell during the long rainy winter months.\n\nFans of organic produce wander among the stalls at The Spread farmers\u2019 market in the trendy Primrose Hill area of London. But the high spirits of the weekend hide a downbeat mood.\n\n\u201cEverything we plant is imported,\u201d said Dave Newton, from Brockmans Farm, at his stall opposite Brambletye\u2019s. \u201cBrexit is going to affect us a lot because prices are going to go up.\n\n\u201cSmall farms are going to suffer the most.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018They won\u2019t come back\u2019 \u2013\n\nLarge farms which export most of their produce, and particularly livestock rearers, are facing the threat of financial ruin.\n\nThey could see the possible loss of European subsidies and huge customs duties while importers could be given tax free incentives.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen yet in terms of subsidies,\u201d said Mike Norledge, who helps run The Spread.\n\n\u201cA lot of workers have to go back to where they\u2019re from, so that\u2019s a worry,\u201d he added.\n\nWoodcock meanwhile said economic conditions since the landmark Brexit vote have not helped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a particularly glamorous job to pick fruit for eight to 10 hours a day,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere was an incentive for workers from poorer countries when the pound was high as they made a lot of money quite quickly.\n\n\u201cWith this sometimes xenophobic atmosphere, the big thing with Brexit is do (workers) feel welcome? If they don\u2019t feel welcome and if there\u2019s not a big incentive for the money, then they\u2019re not going to come.\u201d\n\nWoodcock herself only employs locally because she has no facilities to house seasonal workers but has faced great difficulties finding anyone.\n\n\u201cThat makes me really worried for other farms. How are they going to manage?\u201d she said.\n\n\u2013 Less variety and quality? \u2013\n\nBrexit supporters have said the country\u2019s exit from the European Union could spur demand for home-grown produce, but some fear it will simply open the door to less stringent checks on food.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a large part of the population that is interested in GM (genetically modified) food and (Brexit) leaves it more open to relaxing regulations,\u201d said Woodcock.\n\n\u201cThere is an impulse for \u2018let\u2019s find a quicker and easier food option\u2019 without thinking about the consequences,\u201d she added.\n\nCustomers at farmers\u2019 markets, for their part, also fear a loss of variety.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a good argument being made for consuming local whenever possible and complementing it with imported goods,\u201d said Christian del Valle, as he shopped in Primrose Hill.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no more responsible place for that than the EU, where the standards are high and the food miles are relatively short.\u201d", "description": "East Grinstead (United Kingdom) (AFP) \u2013 On the face of it, Ellie Woodcock\u2019s organic farm two hours south of London shouldn\u2019t be affected", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/5af0dd_organic-farm-co-manager-ellie-woodcock-brambletye-fruit-in-east-sussex-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
