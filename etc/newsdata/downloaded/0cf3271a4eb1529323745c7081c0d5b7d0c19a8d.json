We want to catalyze more research and development in this area and ensure that there are better open source tools to detect deepfakes.\u201d\n\nVideos will be filmed using professional actors to serve as a data set for developers to create deepfake detection tools, with $10 million from Facebook going toward research collaborations and prizes meant to encourage participation, Mr. Schroepfer wrote about the \u201cDeepfake Detection Challenge.\u201d\n\nNo Facebook user data will be used in the data set, the blog post said.\n\nPartners involved in addition to Microsoft include researchers from the Partnership on AI consortium, Cornell Tech, MIT, the University of Oxford in the U.K., the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Maryland at College Park and the State University of New York at Albany, Facebook said.\n\nMicrosoft referred to the Facebook post when reached for comment.\n\nCalls for internet companies to take action against deepfakes have intensified leading up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election amid concerns that seemingly real but doctored videos could play a part in any online disinformation campaign launched during the race.\n\nRussian internet users weaponized social media platforms including Facebook to spread disinformation and propaganda during the 2016 U.S. presidential race, according to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and senior members of the Trump administration have warned that the 2020 elections risk being attacked online as well.\n\n\u201cSocial media platforms have a unique responsibility to identify and remove disinformation before it goes viral, and with voting in the first 2020 primaries less than six months away, the platforms must urgently prepare for increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in response to the Deepfake Detection Challenge.\n\n\u201cThese efforts by Facebook, Microsoft, the Partnership on AI, and their academic partners will be very important to the process, and I hope these companies will continue to pursue comprehensive measures to prevent harmful deepfakes from poisoning our national dialogue online,\u201d Mr. Warner said.\n\nFacebook came under fire in May after the company refused to follow YouTube in blocking users from sharing a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat, that had been slowed to make her speech seem slurred.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive and co-founder, was subsequently targeted in a deepfake video that spread virally the following month on Instagram, a Facebook-owned photo- and video-sharing app.\n\n\u201cImagine this for a second: One man, with total control of billions of people\u2019s stolen data, all their secrets, their lives, their futures,\u201d Mr. Zuckerberg seemed to say in the doctored clip.\n\nFacebook and Instagram have about 2.38 billion and 1 billion users, according to a report published Wednesday by the New York University\u2019s Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.\n\nThe report, \u201cDisinformation and the 2020 Election: How the Social Media Industry Should Prepare,\u201d listed detecting and removing deepfake videos as a top priority for companies ahead of next year\u2019s race.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
