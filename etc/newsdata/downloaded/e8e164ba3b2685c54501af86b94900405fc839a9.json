Today, Andrew Scheer is doubling down on that hostility and seeking a mandate to cut,\u201d said Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) President Hassan Yussuff. \u201cWith a platform loaded with job-killing service cuts, it\u2019s clear that Andrew Scheer represents an equal threat to Canadians as Stephen Harper.\u201d\n\nOver the last four years, measurable progress has been made to protect the rights of workers, create a stronger Canada Pension Plan, move towards pay equity across the federal sector, and protect victims of domestic violence. These are advancements that working Canadians hold dear, yet so much more remains to be done.\n\n\u201cThe next government must put the well-being of all Canadians at the top of its agenda. We cannot go backwards on jobs, social programs, equity or fairness. We now know exactly what a Conservative government means\u2014cuts to public services, attacks on workers and giveaways to connected, wealthy insiders,\u201d added Yussuff. \u201cAfter years of progress, we need a government committed to building a fair Canada for everyone, not one seeking a mandate to cut. We simply cannot risk going backwards.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Canadian Labour Congress"], "top_image": "http://www.globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/561572?filename=561572.png&size=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
