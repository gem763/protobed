But it has to be embedded that climate change and environmental risk are mission critical,\" she added.", "description": "Lagarde argued a prolonged period of ultra-easy policy is necessary given global challenges, weak growth and uncomfortably low inflation.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106110868-1567597166704gettyimages-1165932419.jpeg?v=1567597208"}
