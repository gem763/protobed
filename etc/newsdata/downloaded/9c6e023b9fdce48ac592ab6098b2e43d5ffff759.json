REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan\n\nThe co-founder of ride sharing and payments firm Gojek as well as a former chairman of Inter Milan soccer club were also named to the cabinet, confirming earlier reports.\n\nThe make-up of the cabinet was being closely watched to see how many technocrats - who are more likely to fall in with Widodo\u2019s plans for boosting growth and investment - were included. In the end, around half of his cabinet of 34 ministers were technocrats, or people with technical knowledge in their field, with the others better known for ties to political parties.\n\n\u201cFirst don\u2019t be corrupt, create a clean system. Second, no separate ministerial vision and mission, only the presidential vision and mission,\u201d Widodo said while seated on the steps of the palace flanked by his ministers.\n\nIndonesia last month saw the biggest student demonstrations in decades opposing new bills that critics say undermine the fight against corruption and threaten basic rights.\n\nIn a cabinet pick that has been criticised by activists, Widodo named his chief rival, Prabowo Subianto, as defence minister.\n\nThe former general who used to head the country\u2019s special forces has been accused by human rights activists of abuses against civilians. His cabinet inclusion is controversial for many supporters of Widodo as well.\n\nBut bringing in Prabowo, Widodo\u2019s sole challenger in April\u2019s bitterly fought poll, could make it easier for the government to push through legislation. With the inclusion of Prabowo\u2019s Gerindra party, government support in parliament increases to 74%.\n\nAfter his swearing in, a relaxed-looking Prabowo said he would immediately head to his ministry.\n\n\u201cI will learn the latest situation and then we will begin work,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nWidodo picked former industry minister and Golkar party chairman Airlangga Hartarto to head his economic team, while confirming the reappointment of Indrawati, an economist, as finance minister, who has now served in various administrations.\n\nThe administration would work to revise 74 existing laws hampering investment using \u201comnibus laws\u201d, Widodo said, referring to laws that group diverse and unrelated issues.\n\nREVIVE INVESTMENT\n\nLuhut Pandjaitan, who was retained as coordinating minister for maritime affairs which also oversees natural resources sector and investment, said Widodo had ordered drafts of \u201comnibus laws\u201d to be completed this year.\n\nThe aim was \u201cto provide as much simplification to investment access as possible so foreign direct investment (FDI) can come in,\u201d said Pandjaitan.\n\nFDI has been sluggish in recent years, due to factors such as regulatory uncertainty and weak commodity prices, and Widodo has complained Indonesia has not attracted as much manufacturing investment seeking relocation out of China compared to rivals.\n\nYose Rizal Damuri at Jakarta\u2019s Center for Strategic and International Studies said the presence of political party representatives in the cabinet remained significant, and could hinder Widodo\u2019s reform campaign.\n\n\u201cParty representatives may have mandates from their own parties,\u201d he said noting that in Widodo\u2019s first term \u201ceveryone had their own agenda\u201d in the cabinet.\n\nWidodo defended his political appointments, saying what was important is that \u201cchairmen or members of parties are able to divide their time well\u201d.\n\nAmong the technocrats, Gojek CEO Nadiem Makarim was named education and culture minister. He told reporters that he had been given the mandate to \u201cbreak\u201d the system down to \u201cinnovate\u201d and would focus on developing \u201ccompetency-based and character-based\u201d education.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\n\u201cWith 300,000 schools and 50 million students... the role of technology is going to be very big in impacting everything,\u201d Makarim said.\n\nAmong other important economic posts, Arifin Tasrif, a former head of the state fertilizer maker, was named minister of energy and mineral resources. Erick Thohir, a billionaire businessman who was chairman of Inter Milan and ran Widodo\u2019s re-election campaign, was allotted the minister of state-owned enterprises post.", "description": "Indonesian President Joko Widodo unveiled his cabinet for a second term on Wednesday, retaining former World Bank executive Sri Mulyani Indrawati as finance minister and tapping the leader of the opposition as he seeks to push through reforms.", "authors": ["Maikel Jefriando", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191023&t=2&i=1443970289&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M06M", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
