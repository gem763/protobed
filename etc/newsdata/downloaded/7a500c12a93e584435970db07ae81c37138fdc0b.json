Here's how it compares to the original.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nApple just revealed the first major update to its wildly popular wireless headphones: The $250 AirPods Pro are a smaller, louder, more expensive, and slightly better version of the AirPods you already know and love.\n\nAmong the upgrades in the AirPods Pro are active noise cancellation, more touch-based controls on the headphones themselves, and water resistance. Also, crucially, they have little rubber tips \u2014 a major design change over the standard Apple AirPods.\n\nHere's a closer look:\n\nBut there's one other major change with the new AirPods Pro you might not have realized: The charging case is larger, and laid out slightly differently than the original charging case.\n\nHere are the two open and side-by-side:\n\nAs you can see above, the old case (left) resembles a case of dental floss. The new case (right) is squatter, wider, and a little thicker than the previous case. Prepare your pockets accordingly!\n\nNotably, the two cases are much more similar in size when the new case is turned on its side, like so:\n\nAs you can see, the AirPods Pro case on the right is a bit taller than the original. Though it's indiscernible in photos, the AirPods Pro case is also slightly thicker than the original.\n\nThe change is likely due to the dimensions of the new earbuds. The portion of the AirPods Pro that fits into your ear is slightly larger than regular AirPods, but the stem is slightly shorter \u2014 hence the need for a shorter but wider case.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the new AirPods Pro charging case is identical to the original: you plunk in your AirPods, and they charge wirelessly. You can charge the case through a Lightning cable or by putting the whole case on a Qi-certified charging mat, and it'll hold 24 hours worth of power for your AirPods Pro.\n\nThe new Apple AirPods Pro arrive in stores on October 30.
