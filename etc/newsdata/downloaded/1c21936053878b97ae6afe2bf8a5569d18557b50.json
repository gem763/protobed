Industry forward cash flow may fall 13 per cent compared to this year to US$10.6 billion because of lower commodity price assumptions, it said.\n\nPeters & Co. echoes the sentiment.\n\n\u201cWe expect slightly higher spending year on year in 2020 for the Canadian large caps (due to project timing, minimal spending in 2019, and narrow 2020 Western Canada Sedimentary Basin oil and gas differentials), and the U.S. large caps to have lower spending and moderated growth outlooks in 2020 if the current strip prevails,\u201d Peters analysts wrote in a note.\n\n\u201cWith investors questioning the rationale for growth capex and focusing on direct returns, commentary on the rationale for higher capital spending will be important,\u201d the Calgary-based investment broker added.\n\nThe federal election could also delay some Canadian oil companies from declaring their 2020 budget forecasts that might usually come with third-quarter results over the next few weeks. Husky Energy Inc., Teck Resources Inc. and Precision Drilling Corp. kick off the Canadian energy earnings season on Thursday.\n\nThat\u2019s the sentiment from National Bank analysts in an industry note as political pundits forecast a minority government of some kind after Monday\u2019s election. It\u2019s just not clear yet which party will be in the driver\u2019s seat as both the Liberals and the Conservatives appear deadlocked in most polls at about 31 per cent support.\n\n\u201cAlthough we typically expect several companies to provide 2020 budget commentary with third quarter results, the October 21 federal election in Canada may cause some to hit pause,\u201d the National Bank analysts wrote.\n\nConventional wisdom sees a Conservative election win as supportive to oil producer spending as the party embraces cuts to regulation and gets its strongest support from oilpatch Alberta. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer has promised to cut the Liberals\u2019 carbon tax, which would benefit extractive industries.\n\nTurning to expectations for third-quarter results, National Bank expects cash flow per share to be 4 per cent lower than a consensus of other analysts on \u201cthe Street,\u201d drawn down by forecasts of 11 per cent less cash flow per share for gas producers.\n\n\u201cWe see volumes being reported lower than expected owing to execution missteps, facility maintenance, curtailment restrictions and third party issues,\u201d National Bank wrote.\n\n\u201cCompounding this for the natural gas names is the potential for weaker than expected commodity pricing, including another challenging quarter for liquid national gas prices.\u201d\n\nWith third-quarter results likely to be a good predictor of whether companies will reach their year-end targets, Bonavista Energy Corp., Husky Energy Inc. and Nuvista Energy Ltd. share a relatively higher risk \u201cof missing expectations or requiring a high degree of execution through year-end,\u201d National Bank wrote.\n\nAs for those who could beat annual guidance, the bank highlighted Baytex Energy Corp., MEG Energy Co. and Whitecap Resources Inc.\n\nA decision expected as early as this month by the Alberta government to offload its contracts for shipping oil by rail could add 120,000 to 220,000 barrels per day to transportation capacity.\n\nRail, although more expensive than pipelines in shipping costs, offers one of the few ways to increase exports. Most pipelines in Canada operate at capacity, which has required many producers to curtail production.\n\nHowever, Peters and Co. notes that several improvements are due to increase egress over the next three to six months. The Enbridge Mainline could add 85,000 bpd, the Line 3 Canada portion may add up to 80,000 bpd, while the Express and Keystone pipelines may increase by 50,000 bpd each, the analyst said.\n\nSentiment in gas equities remains low, National Bank said. \u201cWhile the fundamental picture for the winter gas trade is setting up nicely, we have less conviction that gas equities will respond positively,\u201d the bank said.\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Federal election could delay some Canadian oil companies from declaring their 2020 budget forecasts that usually come with third-quarter results", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/prescision-drilling.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
