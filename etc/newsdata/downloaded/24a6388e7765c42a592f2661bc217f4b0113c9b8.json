We make choices and we make decisions in our lives that set things in motion that we can\u2019t blame other people for.\u201d\n\nIn the movie, Henry (Smith) is a 51-year-old assassin who announces his retirement from the fictional Defense Intelligence Agency. When he is pursued by another assassin, he is shocked to see his own face staring back at him. Junior (Smith) is Henry\u2019s clone, now age 23. Henry\u2019s past literally has come to destroy him.\n\n\u201cI just thought it was a really clever and creative way to say that we are the architects of our ultimate rise or fall,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of why I love science-fiction because you can put those things under really wild visual landscapes.\u201d\n\nAng Lee, who directed Gemini Man, saw the technical challenge as the next step after he directed Life of Pi, in which visual effects artists created a realistic tiger for his film. A realistic human would be even more difficult.\n\n\u201cI experienced the tiger in Life of Pi,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI know with a human face. You\u2019re playing with fire. It\u2019s pretty scary but at the same time it\u2019s pretty exciting. So I signed on.\u201d\n\nLee and Smith agreed that the philosophical element was just as exciting as the technology. Lee related to Smith\u2019s philosophical idea about planting the seeds of one\u2019s own destruction.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I hear a clone, a younger version, I just knew I\u2019m old enough to deal with this stuff,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf we put all this philosophical stuff in there, what kind of fun are we going to have?\u201d\n\nComputers could make Will Smith look like he was 23 again, but the actor still had to find a way to act as his 23-year-old self.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fake innocence,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAs a young actor, it\u2019s easier to play older, but [when you\u2019re] older, it\u2019s difficult to impossible to play younger. Once you know some stuff, it\u2019s in your eyes. It\u2019s in your cells.\u201d\n\nClay Varris (Clive Owen) created Junior and raised him to be the perfect specimen. That means Junior missed out on some of the normal teenage life experiences. Just playing a virgin was challenging to Smith.\n\n\u201cTo try to have eyes that unknow sex, once you\u2019ve had sex, you walk different,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s in your back. So their job in creating a digital human was to be able to sell that innocence and that youth.\u201d\n\nWhen Smith was 23, he starred on the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. He had his first dramatic role in Six Degrees of Separation in 1993 when he was 25. Junior not only looks like Smith did in the early \u201990s, but he acts like Smith did then too.\n\nSmith said Lee picked out scenes from Smith\u2019s work in Fresh Prince, Six Degrees, Bad Boys, Independence Day and Men in Black. Based on scenes from those films and that show, Smith crafted his Junior performance.\n\n\u201cWe found these really honest moments in some of my early work,\u201d Smith said\n\nCloning makes a young version of Henry possible. Visual effects make a young version of Will Smith possible. Gemini Man then asks the audience what makes Henry and Junior such different people.\n\n\u201cOne of the major discussions that we were having [was] in terms of nature versus nurture,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you\u2019re genetically identical, how much does your life experience affect the things that you say and do and feel?\u201d\n\nJunior grew up under Clay\u2019s guidance, and backstory reveals Henry escaped a difficult childhood.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to draw as big a difference as possible as we could between the characters,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHenry, who grew up in a brutal household, he had a tougher upbringing, while Junior had the perfect upbringing with Clive\u2019s character.\u201d\n\nSmith said he saw Gemini Man as a way to explore the nature vs. nurture debate. Junior has Henry\u2019s DNA but a different father figure. Yet both went into the business of killing.\n\n\u201cIn drawing those distinctions, it was interesting that it still came down to two men who had taken these gifts that they had and still turned them into [similar] things,\u201d Smith said. \u201c[Their killings] were still going to create nightmares and were going to create a horrible end to this experience.\u201d\n\nGemini Man prompted Smith to look back at his 23-year-old self, and he realized his younger self had some admirable qualities that gradually faded away.\n\n\u201cMy younger self was wildly and insanely aggressive,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAt 23 years old, I was naive and ambitious and aggressive. There\u2019s a power to naivety. There\u2019s a power that I\u2019m actually trying to get back in my life right now.\u201d\n\nSmith prefers to keep the Henry/Junior debates hypothetical. He sees human cloning on the horizon and worries about its consequences.\n\n\u201cWe reach for poisoned honey a lot in order to overcome our pain and suffering,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy opinion is that cloning will ultimately pan out to be poisoned honey. It will be a reach that will potentially come back and bite humanity in a way that we\u2019re probably not considering fully.\u201d\n\nAs for the groundbreaking technology, Lee hopes viewers don\u2019t ask how the studio made Will Smith young. He hopes viewers just believe Junior is a unique character.\n\n\u201cThe biggest praise we have is nobody thinks about that,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey just watch the movie and watch the story.\u201d\n\nGemini Man opens in theaters Friday.", "description": "LOS ANGELES, Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 In Gemini Man, 51-year-old Will Smith portrays his 23-year-old self, exploring his own battle within. \u201cI loved", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
