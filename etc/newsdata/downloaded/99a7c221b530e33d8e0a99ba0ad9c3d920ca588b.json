The company has drawn the ire of government watchdogs, state attorneys general and congressional Democrats. And a trove of documents obtained by POLITICO show that Education Department officials, too, have raised serious questions about its performance over the years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNonetheless, as its $1.3 billion, 10-year contract expires in December, the loan servicing behemoth will be able to draw on unusually close ties to the administration as it seeks more government business \u2014 a fact that has its critics crying foul and citing it as a symbol of revolving-door abuses in the federal government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very clear from day one that Secretary DeVos is only interested in stacking the Department with industry lobbyists and offering a free pass to companies that are ripping off students and families all over this country,\u201d said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who has sued the company for allegedly mistreating student loan borrowers in the public-service forgiveness program and others.\n\nFedLoan and its parent firm\u2019s ties to Trump\u2019s political organization and DeVos\u2019 Education Department are significant.\n\nA company now led by one of Trump\u2019s most trusted supporters, David Urban, who oversaw his victorious campaign in Pennsylvania, has been its Washington lobbying firm since at least 1999, and Urban was personally listed as its lobbyist until last year, according to federal lobbying disclosure records.\n\nThen, in April, amid growing public scrutiny of the loan-servicing company, PHEAA hired Kathleen Smith, a former top DeVos aide, as senior vice president and director of federal relations.\n\nMorning Education A daily dose of education policy news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

A 2017 report criticized loan servicers, including PHEAA, for bungling payments of borrowers who were supposed to be on track for loan forgiveness.\n\nCameron fills the vacancy left last year by the departure of Seth Frotman, who resigned in protest of what he said was the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the bureau's oversight of student loan companies.\n\n\u201cPHEAA spent a decade cheating students, borrowers and taxpayers and is now cozying up to the Trump administration to escape the consequences of its mismanagement and illegal practices,\u201d Frotman told POLITICO. \u201cThis is corruption, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, where Democrats have criticized the failure of the loan-forgiveness program, the company\u2019s close ties to the Trump administration have provoked scorn.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) blasted the company\u2019s \u201cutterly abysmal\u201d track record of \u201cfailing student loan borrowers and mishandling\u201d the loan forgiveness program. Warren said in a letter addressed to the Trump administration that it was \u201coutrageous\u201d to select a former company executive as a government watchdog for the industry.\n\n\u201cA former PHEAA executive\u2019s appointment to the role represents the worst form of revolving door corruption and conflict of interest, and it epitomizes industry capture of our government,\u201d Warren wrote, urging the administration to rescind the appointment.\n\nPHEAA insists that, as a contractor, it takes its cues from the Education Department and federal rules.\n\n\u201cAs a federal servicer, we are contractually required to service programs in compliance with federal rules and legislation,\u201d said Keith New, a PHEAA spokesperson, in an email. \u201cWe lack the authority to change program rules without falling out of compliance with our contracts and jeopardizing earnings that are used to fund student aid programs\u201d in Pennsylvania.\n\nNonetheless, PHEAA\u2019s performance has come under sharp criticism by regulators and government watchdogs.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s inspector general earlier this year faulted the agency for not taking action against PHEAA, as well as other loan servicers, when they make errors. And a trove of internal Education Department reviews of PHEAA obtained by POLITICO also shows that the department, dating back to the Obama administration, has long had concerns with the performance of the company.\n\nEducation Department reviewers identified a range of deficiencies in how PHEAA calculated and counted borrowers\u2019 progress in making 10 years of payments, which could mean borrowers end up paying more than needed before having their loans forgiven. In one memo, dated October 2017, department officials wrote that their review of PHEAA found it was \u201cnot currently counting payments correctly\u201d for all borrowers in some circumstances.\n\nThe documents cited loan servicing problems in which borrowers who overpaid their monthly bill lost out on progress toward loan forgiveness. The department also found discrepancies that led to mathematically impossible payment counts for thousands of borrowers with consolidation loans.\n\nThe Education Department\u2019s financial aid unit, which hires loan servicers like PHEAA to manage the payments of the roughly 45 million Americans who owe federal student loans, has long been a place where officials move between private industry and government. For instance, Mark LaVia, the career department official who oversees PHEAA and other student loan servicing companies, was a longtime PHEAA employee before he was hired during the Obama administration.\n\nBut the company\u2019s ties to the Trump administration have grown stronger over the past several years, as has scrutiny over how it manages student loan payments. And the Trump administration has also actively taken steps to help the company.\n\nThe Justice Department last year urged a Massachusetts judge to block the state\u2019s attorney general from pursuing a lawsuit against PHEAA \u2014 an effort that was unsuccessful. The suit by the Massachusetts attorney general alleges that PHEAA overcharged some borrowers and improperly counted monthly payments in a way that caused public servants to miss out on the loan forgiveness to which they were entitled.\n\nEmails released by the department in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit showed that attorneys for the company and the administration were in close contact about the case.\n\nMassachusetts Playbook newsletter Our must-read rundown of what\u2019s up on Beacon Hill and beyond.

You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nIn addition to Massachusetts, two other states \u2014 Washington and Kentucky \u2014 have opened investigations into the company relating to its servicing of private student loans. Both state attorneys general are fighting with PHEAA in court over whether it must turn over records as part of the inquiries into allegedly unfair and deceptive business practices.\n\nPHEAA\u2019s current contract with the Education Department expires in December, though it could be extended. The company has separately bid on aspects of a new loan servicing platform, called NextGen, the Trump administration is in the process of developing.\n\nSmith, the former top aide to DeVos, joined PHEAA in April. During her time at the Education Department, Smith was involved in developing the legal guidance that DeVos signed last year to declare companies like PHEAA off-limits to state regulators when they are collecting federal student loans \u2014 which was a top priority for the company. She also helped lead the office that manages PHEAA\u2019s federal contract.\n\nNew, the PHEAA spokesperson, said Smith \u201cwas hired to provide strategic and policy input while also representing our agency in many different and complex facets of our business.\u201d\n\nJeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, called Smith\u2019s hiring a particularly \u201cbrazen\u201d move. While many executive branch officials have left government for jobs in which they seek to influence their former colleagues or trade on their connections, he said, fewer have registered to lobby the agency they left just months earlier.\n\n\u201cIt just blows my mind,\u201d Hauser said. \u201cIt shows her confidence that there will be no repercussions. There\u2019s obviously a breakdown in the ethics enforcement at the Education Department.\u201d\n\nSmith signed a lobbying disclosure form in July that outlines a wide range of lobbing activity involving the Trump administration. The disclosure lists lobbying of Education Department and CFPB on the \u201coversight issues surrounding\u201d PHEAA \u2014 as well as the \u201cimplementation and administration\u201d of its federal contract.\n\nYet Smith and the Education Department said in statements to POLITICO that she has not lobbied the agency since joining PHEAA earlier this year. The lobbying disclosure names both Smith and her predecessor at the company.\n\nUnder Trump\u2019s 2017 ethics executive order, political appointees are, with some exceptions, not allowed to lobby their former agencies for five years after leaving the administration. \u201cLike all appointees, Kathleen Smith signed the ethics pledge,\u201d an Education Department official said in an email to POLITICO. \u201cBecause she is lobbying Congress and not lobbying us, she\u2019s not in violation of the pledge.\u201d\n\nSmith said she had conversations with other entities besides the Education Department about federal student loan servicing contracts, but said she had \u201cnot lobbied the Department of Education since taking on my role at PHEAA on that or any other issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am proud of the work I have done and more importantly how I have done that work \u2014 treating people with respect and dignity, working honestly and openly and in the best interest of students and families,\u201d Smith said in the statement. \u201cI have worked with and for people of all different ideological positions and policy priorities.\u201d\n\nAmerican Continental Group, whose president, Urban, was Trump\u2019s former Pennsylvania co-chairman, is PHEAA's longtime lobbying firm. Until last September, Urban was personally listed on federal disclosures last year as having lobbied Congress, the White House and Justice Department on behalf of PHEAA. During that time, the Justice Department sought to block the Massachusetts lawsuit brought against the company.\n\nNew, the PHEAA spokesperson, said that the organization has \u201ca long relationship\u201d with American Continental Group \u201cthat spans several administrations and relates to the complex and always changing parameters of student aid programs that are rooted in federal legislation.\u201d Urban did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which PHEAA exclusively manages, was the brainchild of congressional Democrats, who wanted to create incentives for young people to pursue public-service jobs \u2014 like teachers, nurses and other public-sector and private charity workers \u2014 without being held back by student loan debt.\n\n\u201cThis legislation will open up or help us take advantage of that idealism that is out there,\u201d then-Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) explained as the program was debated on the Senate floor in 2007. \u201cWe are giving them a pathway to making a difference in terms of the future of our country.\u201d\n\nMany conservatives objected to the program, citing its budgetary costs and the notion that the government would promote some types of careers over others. President George W. Bush also opposed the program, but he signed it into law as part of a broader bill negotiated between his administration and a Democratic-controlled Congress that also expanded student aid and Pell Grants.\n\nThe legislation promised loan forgiveness to public servants who made payments on their debt for 10 years. But it would take the first group of borrowers nearing eligibility for that loan forgiveness at the beginning of 2017 for the problems with the program to become widely known.\n\nThe law outlined a complicated set of criteria for when borrowers could obtain loan forgiveness: Borrowers must be in the correct repayment plan, must have a certain type of federal loan and must work for an eligible public-service employer, for instance.\n\nThe most recent set of federal data, from April, revealed that 75,138 out of 76,002 applicants had been rejected for public-service loan forgiveness.\n\nTrump administration officials, including DeVos, have said they are faithfully carrying out the Public Service Loan Forgiveness law as it was passed by Congress even as they seek to eliminate it. The administration blames the high denial rate for the program on the complex requirements in the law.\n\n\u201cCongress set up a program that's hard to qualify for,\u201d DeVos told the House education committee in April. \u201cWe are continuing to address every application \u2014 and for those who do qualify, we are proceeding with their loan forgiveness.\u201d\n\nDeVos testified that the administration wants to phase out the program \u201cbecause we don\u2019t think that one type of a job, one type of role, should be incentivized over another.\u201d She cited the example of a nurse working at a nonprofit hospital, who would be eligible for loan forgiveness, as opposed to a nurse employed by a for-profit hospital, who would not.\n\nBut the program also has significant bipartisan support on Capitol Hill. Even a Republican-controlled Congress in the first two years of the Trump administration rejected efforts by some conservatives and the White House to eliminate the program.\n\nIn response to questions for this story, the Education Department provided a statement from Mark Brown, whom DeVos appointed earlier this year to lead the office that oversees loan servicing companies.\n\nThe companies should \u201cefficiently and promptly serve\u201d student loan borrowers, Brown said in the statement. He said he sent letters to all of the companies earlier this year and \u201cfollowed up these letters and traveled to meet in-person with the servicers including PHEAA.\u201d\n\nPHEAA was \u201cnot meeting\u201d the Trump administration\u2019s expectations for performance, Brown wrote in his April letter to the company, which was obtained by POLITICO. He cited increasing call wait times, among other problems, that \"resulted in borrowers being unable to have their concerns or questions resolved in a timely manner.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis level of performance is wholly unacceptable,\u201d Brown wrote to PHEAA. His letter did not note any specific problems with the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.\n\nDemocrats have been strong proponents of the loan forgiveness program, which benefits key constituenicies for the party: public-sector workers and teachers, among others. One of the nation\u2019s largest teachers unions, the American Federation of Teachers, earlier this year filed a class-action lawsuit against DeVos over what it says were improperly rejected applications of teachers seeking public-service loan forgiveness.\n\nMore recently, the problems with the program have also made it onto the 2020 campaign trail.\n\nEven as progressive candidates like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Warren propose sweeping debt cancellation plans for all borrowers, nearly every Democrat running for president has called for keeping Public Service Loan Forgiveness or even expanding it.\n\nDuring a Democratic presidential primary debate in July, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg pitched the program as a fairer and more realistic alternative to the one-time massive debt cancellations sought by more progressive candidates.\n\n\u201cFor those of us who do have a lot of debt, we can make it more affordable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we can expand a Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is an excellent program that is almost impossible to actually get access to right now.\u201d\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) similarly called for bolstering the existing program rather than adopting more sweeping free college plans. \u201cI would make sure that we improve those student loan repayment programs for our teachers and expand them,\u201d she said, calling for loan forgiveness \u201cover five, 10 years\u201d for borrowers who \u201cgo into occupations where we don't have enough workers.\u201d\n\nAnd former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas has also pitched expanding the program during campaign appearances, framing the program as a way to solve shortages in public-service jobs like nurses.\n\nA handful of 2020 contenders have also signed onto legislation led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to make the benefits of the program more generous to borrowers: Warren, Sanders, Klobuchar, Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). Former Vice President Joe Biden has called on fixing the bureaucratic problems with the program.\n\nCongressional Democrats negotiated hundreds of millions of dollars in the past two government funding bills that were meant to provide a \u201cfix\u201d to the high rate of denials for borrowers. That new program, however, has similarly been plagued by widespread rejections \u2014 and has led to loan forgiveness for few borrowers.\n\nThe new, temporary program was designed for borrowers who thought they were on track to receive loan forgiveness but were enrolled in the wrong repayment plan. But that program itself is also a complicated maze of requirements that most borrowers who apply for it are not meeting.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report last week criticized the Education Department for failing to create a \u201cborrower-friendly\u201d process to accept applications. The GAO analysis found that only 661 of the 54,184 applications reviewed by the department have been approved \u2014 which, like the original program, means it has a 1 percent acceptance rate.", "description": "The company that rejected 99 percent of applicants for public-service loan forgiveness is leaning on political contacts as it comes under fire.", "authors": ["Michael Stratford"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ea/3d/d884de7348f79e602e5b78772399/198150betsy-devos-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
