Although the new models feature relatively marginal improvements to their predecessors, the launch was staged with much fanfare by Google, as if it represented a major breakthrough for the company and the smartphone market \u2013 despite most of the product specs being leaked before the event. The launch was just the latest in a series of product launches by leading digital tech companies that sharply overstated recent innovations.\n\nOn September 10, for instance, Apple introduced three new iPhones, revamped Apple Watches and two new subscriptions services, TV+ and Apple Arcade. Two weeks later, Amazon presented a long list of new gadgets at its Alexa event. All these launches have something in common: the \u201cnovelties\u201d they introduce are merely iterations of their existing product offering, yet they are presented as revolutionary.\n\nExaggeration does not come as a surprise in marketing and advertisement. Yet digital corporations pursue a precise strategy with their product launches. The main goal of these events is not so much introducing specific gadgets. It is to position these companies at the centre of the aura that the so-called digital revolution has acquired for billions of users \u2013 and customers \u2013 around the world.\n\nLong history\n\nLaunching new technology devices through public events predates Silicon Valley. Alexander Graham Bell and Guglielmo Marconi, two of the most popular inventors and entrepreneurs in the late 19th and early 20th century, organised events to present the telephone and wireless telegraphy.\n\nThe audience at these events were mainly scientists or technical experts, but they were also attended by politicians, entrepreneurs, and even kings and queens. The celebrated American inventor Thomas Edison went one step further, presenting his new products in public events such as international exhibitions and tech fairs.\n\nLike today, launches of new products helped shape public opinion and to make a name for companies such as AT&T, Marconi and Edison. They were even used to fight commercial wars. At the end of the 19th century Edison launched a campaign of public events to promote his direct current standard against the rival alternating current. He even electrocuted animals (like the elephant Topsy) in front of journalists to demonstrate that the other standard was dangerous.\n\nMore recently, Steve Jobs followed the footsteps of these inventor-entrepreneurs and codified a \u201cgenre\u201d \u2013 the so-called keynote. Alone on stage and wearing roll neck and jeans (an informal \u201cuniform\u201d for geeks), Jobs launched several Apple products in front of audiences of tech-enthusiasts. These events helped build the myth of Steve Jobs and Apple.\n\nWhat product launches are really about\n\nJobs\u2019 talent was more in the marketing and promoting of new devices than in developing technology. Since the 1980s, Apple\u2019s founder recognised the power of a new vision surrounding digital technologies. This vision saw the personal computer and later the internet as harbingers of a new era.\n\nIt was a powerful cultural myth centred around the idea that we are experiencing a digital \u201crevolution\u201d, a concept traditionally associated with political change that now came to describe the impact of new technology. In this context, Jobs carefully staged his launches in order to present Apple as the embodiment of this myth.", "description": "Tech companies use product launches to position themselves as the heroes of the digital revolution.", "authors": ["Simone Natale", "Senior Lecturer In Communication", "Media Studies", "Loughborough University", "Gabriele Balbi", "Associate Professor In Media Studies", "Universit\u00e0 Della Svizzera Italiana", "Paolo Bory", "Lecturer In Media Studies"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GmgLnXiXIHoFRRQ7Uop53w--~B/aD0zMDk7dz0yMzc7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_464/fc35092800b679484a6d5fa37fac3e81", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
