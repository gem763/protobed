The guests laugh \u2013 his friendly remark is clearly meant in jest \u2013 but minutes later they are gone.\n\nDes Gunewardena is plotting a big expansion for his D&D London restaurant group\n\nIf Gunewardena, a smooth Sri Lankan-born entrepreneur, is not a celebrity outside the fine dining scene, many of the 44 restaurants he runs through his firm D&D London are household names.\n\nQuaglino's \u2013 or 'Quags' to many of its patrons \u2013 has Royal connections, hosting the Queen and Prince Philip's first public date and allowing Princess Diana to slip out via the kitchen to avoid the paparazzi.\n\nThe cast of TV show Made In Chelsea are regulars at D&D's Bluebird in Chelsea while its Paternoster Chop House is the set for the Channel 4 show First Dates. 'We don't have a strategy for getting celebrities,' Gunewardena insists. 'It just happened to us.'\n\nAll around him, other restaurants \u2013 both high-end and mid-market \u2013 are closing their doors. Last week, it emerged that one of Britain's best-loved chains, Pizza Express, could be sunk by its \u00a31.1billion debts.\n\nD&D London, which was formed by a management buyout of Sir Terence Conran's eponymous restaurant group, has around \u00a335million of bank debt, and posted a \u00a35.7million pre-tax loss in its latest accounts, up to March 2018.\n\nBut Gunewardena says both revenues and profits are up this year, with sales from his restaurants set to rise by \u00a313million to \u00a3145million in his firm's next trading update. So instead of keeping his head down, he is plotting a big expansion.\n\nBon Viveur: Quaglino\u2019s is one of 44 restaurants run by Des Gunewardena, of D&D London\n\nNext month, D&D will open a \u00a35million restaurant called 14 Hills, located 'bang in the middle of the insurance market' near Liverpool Street station.\n\nThe lease on another East London site is being negotiated, and D&D will open a restaurant next to Harvey Nichols in Bristol next Easter as the group continues expanding outside the capital. When 14 Hills opens in November, naturally there will be a party.\n\n'We'll have some interesting people there,' Gunewardena grins.\n\nSo why is he so confident when rivals such as Jamie Oliver are in his words 'going down the tubes'? According to Gunewardena, it's because many of those eating out are avoiding soulless chains, instead seeking out 'excellent service and atmosphere'.\n\nHe says: 'Customers are looking for quality and authenticity, and in increasing numbers they prefer to go to restaurants with individuality, like ours, rather than branded chains.\n\n'We have always understood this and many of our venues are talked about as much for their buzz and atmosphere as for the food and wine they serve. We allow our chefs and managers to run their restaurants as if they are independent businesses. Therefore they haven't suffered the lowering of quality that a number of rival restaurant groups have been affected by as they have grown.'\n\nNext month, D&D will open a \u00a35million restaurant called 14 Hills, located 'bang in the middle of the insurance market' near Liverpool Street station\n\nOf course, he can't shrug off the economic chill completely. When pressed, he admits sales growth is not as strong as in previous years due to a slowdown in corporate spending. 'We are seeing flat trading,' he says. 'That always happens when you have potential financial or political crises \u2013 the corporates become more cautious. But I'm hoping we'll see a bounceback after November.'\n\nGunewardena, 62, started his career as a strategist for property tycoon Gerald Ronson after qualifying as an accountant at Ernst & Young. It was the buccaneering late 1980s and Ronson \u2013 later jailed as one of the 'Guinness Four' in a share-dealing fraud \u2013 was empire-building with bravado, buying banks in Arizona and building skyscrapers in Manhattan. 'He had plenty of money,' chuckles Gunewardena.\n\nHe then left to work for Conran, eventually running his restaurants business during the Cool Britannia era of the 1990s. When Gunewardena and his business partner David Loewi \u2013 the other 'D' in D&D \u2013 bought out Conran Restaurants in 2006, the process was initially friendly but soured in a legal dispute.\n\nPointedly, Gunewardena says of Conran, his former mentor: 'People always say [of D&D] 'you're the Conran guys'. But actually we've opened more restaurants as D&D than we did as Conran.'\n\nStruggling: Pizza Express could be sunk by its \u00a31.1billion debts\n\nOver the past three years, openings in Manchester, Leeds and New York have diluted the group's emphasis on London, with a quarter of its restaurants now in the UK regions or overseas. This trend will continue, Gunewardena reveals.\n\nD&D is in talks with US property firms to open further sites in New York and other major US cities.\n\nGunewardena says America is a 'tough market' and his two latest New York restaurants \u2013 Queens-yard and an outpost of Bluebird \u2013 are still 'trying to get a return'. He adds: 'When you open a restaurant, everyone comes. Then the challenge is how to maintain your revenue and continue to grow. Our plan, if things go well, is to expand more in the US. But if we do it, we are keen on making sure expansion is properly grounded.'\n\nGunewardena is happy for D&D to remain a private company, after scrapping plans to float in 2015. He jokes that his role as a non-exec on listed firm Fulham Shore, which owns pizza chain Franco Manca, has given him enough of a taste of public markets. 'I want to stay under the radar,' he says.\n\nAs he leaves \u2013 to meet entrepreneur Dominika Sadowska about letting customers use D&D restaurants as offices in the day \u2013 he says: 'It's no use opening a ton of restaurants and they all lose money.'\n\nWith his trademark smile, he adds: 'We don't close restaurants.'", "description": "Des Gunewardena bursts through the door of Sartoria, his Italian restaurant on London's Savile Row, greeting the manageress with an effusive 'Buongiorno!'", "authors": ["Harriet Dennys For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
