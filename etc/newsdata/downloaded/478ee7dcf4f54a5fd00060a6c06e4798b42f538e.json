The best medicine is to be all together.\n\n\u201cWe need to move on. We\u2019ve lost three points and we need to move on and face Brighton (in the Premier League) and then at this stadium again in the Champions League next.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nLucas Moura, whose hat-trick at Ajax in the semi-final sent Tottenham into the final, believes they can recover.\n\n\u201cThe season is so big and we have a lot of games,\u201d the Brazilian said. \u201cThe beginning of the last Champions League season was worse than this.\n\n\u201cWe can come back and we will come back.\u201d", "description": "With some justification Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino praised his side's first-half display against Bayern Munich on Tuesday but looked as shell-shocked as his players trying to come to terms with a 7-2 home defeat.", "authors": ["Martyn Herman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436058131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF903OY", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
