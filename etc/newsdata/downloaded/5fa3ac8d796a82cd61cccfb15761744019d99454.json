I love doing the show, I love working with Nicole.\n\n\"I love working with Simon, and it's like a whole new X Factor , it's not like it was.\n\n\"The show is great fun, and it pays!\"\n\nOne of the contestants has been saying a lot about the show too after a tweet from 2011 was unearthed.\n\nBen Foden said that the \"terrible\" X-Factor was on its last legs.\n\nHe tweeted: \"Did Nicole Scherzinger just Meow????? Very weird??? X factor seems to be on the way out... terrible TV.\"\n\nNow he is getting ready to take to the stage and will hope his comments don't get dragged up by the judges.\n\nSimon knows it's an important time, saying: \"You can't just keep making the same show that it was 14 years ago and expect it to be the same show today.\n\n\"You've got to take a step back for a little while.\"\n\n\"It just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version. The only condition was I couldn't know who was going to be on it.", "description": "The host is back this weekend - and so are judges Nicole Scherzinger and Louis Walsh", "authors": ["Sam Elliott", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13892811.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_national_tv_awards_2019_02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
