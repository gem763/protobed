REUTERS/Murad Sezer\n\nTurkey pounded Kurdish militia in northeast Syria for a second day on Thursday, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee, killing dozens and drawing international condemnation.\n\nThose militia have been holding thousands of Islamic State militants in prisons and tens of thousands of their relatives in camps in the region. One senior Kurdish official warned the fighters could break out as the violence intensifies.\n\n\u201cIf Daesh (Islamic State) camps or prisons are in the safe zone, we are responsible,\u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a rare briefing with international media.\n\nTurkey would ask the home countries of foreign Islamic State prisoners in its zone to take them back. If the foreign countries refuse - as many have - \u201cit is our responsibility that they (the Islamic State prisoners) are held accountable and not released,\u201d he said.\n\nTurkey would not be responsible for Islamic State prisoners held in other parts of Syria, he added.\n\nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan defended Turkey\u2019s operation in a fiery speech on Thursday, dismissing global criticism and threatening to send more than 3 million Syrian refugees into Europe.\n\nHe also reiterated a plan to settle millions of Syrian refugees in the \u201csafe zone\u201d in northeastern Syria, saying Turkey aimed to realise this with international funding.\n\nThe EU has said it will not provide any financial aid to Turkey for the plans.
