But there are instances when your romantic partner is also your best friend, and this is certainly the case for me. We met in a joint school band rehearsal, so I knew we had a mutual interest in music. The way she kicked off the conversation was so shocking that I still remember it clearly. \u201cYou seem to hate my friend, don\u2019t you?\u201d We talked about our interests, our schools and everything else under the sun. Eventually we became the most important person in each other\u2019s life. A best friend is not only someone you laugh with, but someone you can cry with, too.\n\nNester Chik Yiu-kai, 17, Sing Yin Secondary School\n\nI met my best friend when I was in Year 3. Although we went to the same school, we weren\u2019t that close back then. We only started talking because we were both just so happened to be going through a rough time with our other friends. Since then, we became inseparable. Sadly, she and her family moved to Canada when she was in Form 1. But we have kept in touch through Skype and text messaging. Every time we talk (even if we have not spoken for 9 months), it feels like no time has passed. I\u2019m really thankful to have a friend who supports me even though she is halfway across the world.\n\nBelinda Ng, 19, University of Cambridge\n\nBest Friends Forever #5: Who to talk to\n\nMy best friend\u2019s name is Joanna, but she prefers to be called Jo or CBTJJ. We\u2019ve been best friends since we were in Grade Five. Now we\u2019re in secondary school. We\u2019re not in the same class anymore, but she is still there whenever I need someone to talk to. She\u2019s the greatest friend I could ever ask for.\n\nIsis Mary Gosamkee, 12, St Francis Canossian College\n\nEveryone has a group of friends, and a best friend that supports us and helps us become a better person. My best friend is Cecilia. We met each other in kindergarten but we lost contact, and met each other again in secondary school. We\u2019ve shared many tears and laughter. She knows when I\u2019m feeling happy or sad. She helps me make good decisions and is the bravest girl I\u2019ve ever met. She is like a big sister who always cares for me, and is very special to me.\n\nMiyuki Wong, 14, Pooi To Middle School\n\nI have a few BFFs and one of them is a doll. It\u2019s very helpful. It holds my textbook open while I do my maths homework, and reminds me what to do by just standing next to my to-do list. I play with it often and imagine it\u2019s alive and has feelings. My friends think it\u2019s just a normal doll, but I know mine is special.\n\nChong Ki-chun, 13, PLK Ma Kam Ming College\n\nEdited by Nicole Moraleda", "description": "A best friend is someone you not only share good times with, but also someone who is there for you during the bad times.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/de19453e-f157-11e9-9f3d-785f2d889e39imagehires125423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
