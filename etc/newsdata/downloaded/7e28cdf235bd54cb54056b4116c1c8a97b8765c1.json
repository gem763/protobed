(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden said on Tuesday he would support opening impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump if the Republican president fails to comply with congressional requests for information on Ukraine and other matters.\n\nBiden, the former vice president, has become swept up in a political furor over reports that Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate Biden and his son, an issue that has intensified Democratic calls for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\nCongressional Democrats have sought information related to Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Biden said it was time for Trump to \u201cstop stonewalling\u201d and cooperate.\n\n\u201cIf he continues to obstruct Congress and flout the law, Donald Trump will leave Congress in my view with no choice but to initiate impeachment proceedings,\u201d Biden told reporters in Wilmington, in his home state of Delaware.\n\n\u201cThat would be a tragedy, but a tragedy of his own making,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has acknowledged he discussed Biden in the July 25 call, but denies he withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Zelenskiy to launch a probe that would damage Biden.\n\nTrump promised on Tuesday to release \u201cthe complete, fully declassified and unredacted\u201d transcript of his call.\n\nDemocrats are also seeking the original complaint about Trump\u2019s call, filed by a whistleblower within the U.S. intelligence community, as well as information on deliberations over the Ukrainian aid.\n\nBiden, who leads polls in the Democratic race to pick a challenger to Trump in the November 2020 election, has said before that impeachment might be necessary if Trump refused to cooperate with ongoing investigations.\n\nBut the statement on Tuesday was the first time he has made the call since the controversy over Ukraine surfaced last week.\n\nMost Democratic presidential contenders support an impeachment inquiry, including U.S. senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Amy Klobuchar; former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and former U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro.\n\n\u201cThe House must impeach,\u201d Warren, the first major contender to call for impeachment in the wake of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report into Russian interference in the 2016 election, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.\n\nPELOSI STATEMENT\n\nThe Washington Post reported that House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi would announce a formal impeachment inquiry later in the day. Pelosi is scheduled to make a public statement at 5 p.m. ET (2100 GMT).\n\nDuring an appearance at an event sponsored by The Atlantic magazine, Pelosi declined to say what action she planned, but told the audience, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely, absolutely essential that the president be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday said he did not try to coerce Zelenskiy to launch a corruption investigation into Biden and his son in return for the U.S. military aid. Trump has produced no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.\n\nIn remarks to reporters over the intensifying controversy, Trump indicated there was nothing sinister about withholding the aid but that he wanted Europe and not just the United States to step up and provide Ukraine assistance.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the One Iowa and GLAAD LGBTQ Presidential Forum in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Scott Morgan\n\nBut Trump also has called Biden and his son, Hunter, \u201ccorrupt\u201d without providing any evidence.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani has suggested Biden improperly used his influence to get Ukraine to dismiss its top prosecutor, who was investigating Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings. The prosecutor had also been criticized by the U.S. government and the European Union for larger issues.\n\nBiden and his son have denied the charge.", "description": "Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden said on Tuesday he would support opening impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump if the Republican president fails to comply with congressional requests for information on Ukraine and other matters.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190925&t=2&i=1433578288&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1P7", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
