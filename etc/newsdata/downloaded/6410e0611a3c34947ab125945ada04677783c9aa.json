That included a record $321 million in 2018-19, which the CEFC said underscored its ability to earn a positive return on investments on behalf of taxpayers.\n\nMr Learmonth said last financial year also saw a jump in the ratio between CEFC's investments and the private finance it has helped secure. Each dollar of CEFC finance committed was matched by more than $3 from the private sector, up from $1.80 in 2017-18.\n\n\"Part of what we are trying to do is draw in the private sector: it's a very large task that the clean energy transition requires and we can't do it by ourselves.\"\n\nLast financial year saw the CEFC's first commitment to a waste-to-energy plant. It has supported what will be the country's largest municipal waste-to-energy project, a 36MW plant at Kwinana south of Perth.\n\nMr Learmonth said the CEFC was hopeful that waste-to-energy would become a growing area for the corporation, utilising waste that would otherwise have gone to landfill and generated methane \u2013 a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.\n\n\"We have plenty of interesting transactions in the pipeline\" in waste-to-energy, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCarbon capture off limits\n\nBut carbon capture and storage projects still remain strictly off limits for the CEFC, despite the growing consensus worldwide among industry, governments and environmental groups that the controversial technology will be required if the world is to meet a target of net zero emissions.\n\nMr Learmonth noted that an amendment to the act governing the CEFC had been moved and introduced to Parliament under the Turnbull government, \"but as we stand today we can't invest in CCS\". He declined to comment on whether it should be on the table.\n\nGas peaking plants are also off limits for the CEFC. But the corporation is advising the federal government on gas peaking and pumped storage projects on the shortlist of the Underwriting New Generation Investments program, he noted.\n\nMr Learmonth said he expected the next 12 months would see the CEFC make financial commitments to pumped hydro and battery storage projects, and make \"good progress\" on investment in other technologies and projects that would supply the security and reliability of the grid through the transition process.", "description": "Transmission, pumped hydro and batteries are set to capture a bigger share of the CEFC's funding commitments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.0347%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_10/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/866b4338564449fa56ecd0f523cbcc3d5b8467ff", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
