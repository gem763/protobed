What did Davis wear?\n\nA headband that said \u201cMan of God.\u201d\n\nWhy did he wear it?\n\nHe wore it during his team\u2019s third game of the season against Seattle to help raise money for the emergency room section of St. Dominic\u2019s Hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, the state which he calls home.\n\nYes, he broke NFL rules.\n\nBut this is the same NFL that let Colin Kaepernick wear his famous pig police socks on the practice field \u2014 the same NFL that allowed players to take a bended knee during the singing of the national anthem \u2014 the same NFL that allowed politics and Black Lives Matter messaging to poison entire seasons and alienate entire fan bases.\n\nThis is the same NFL that actually broke its own uniform policy by allowing players to promote charitable causes on their cleats for a set week in December of the 2016 season.\n\nThis is the same NFL that sparked this headline in 2015, from Forbes: \u201cWhy Isn\u2019t The NFL Enforcing Its Uniform Code?\u201d The piece went on to recount how \u201cPittsburgh Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward wrote IRON HEAD on his eyeblack strips, honoring his father and former NFLer Craig \u2018Ironhead\u2019 Heyward, who passed away from brain cancer in 2006 \u2026 [and how] teammate DeAngelo Williams took up the approach [too] when he wore eyeblack strips that featured the words \u2018Find The Cure\u2019 and an image of the pink breast cancer ribbon.\u201d\n\nGranted, both Heyward and Williams were docked several thousands of dollars.\n\nBut the point is: The NFL\u2019s uniform code has been broken on past occasions, for various reasons, with various results.\n\nAt least Davis wasn\u2019t wearing pig police socks.\n\nHis story has an update: \u201cSo my agent just told me that I won my appeal and won\u2019t have to pay the headband fine!!\u201d he wrote on Instagram.\n\nAnd his message appeared alongside a photograph of children at the school all sporting headbands with the same \u201cMan of God\u201d message. Davis finished with this: \u201cLook at all these beautiful children of God. Always glory above so I\u2019m taking every penny of that original $7,017 fine and donating it to [St. Dominic\u2019s] anyways,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn the meanwhile, sales of \u201cMan of God\u201d headbands \u2014 along with \u201cWoman of God\u201d headbands \u2014 have spiked. All due to coverage about the NFL fine.\n\n\u201cSo far, we\u2019ve raised over $30,000 for [the hospital] from the headbands,\u201d Davis said.\n\nAnd wait for it, wait for it. Here come the \u201cChild of God\u201d headbands, with proceeds helping the hospital, as well.\n\nGreat story. In a celebrity sports atmosphere that gives rise to the likes of a Colin Kaepernick, it\u2019s oh-so-inspiring to know that \u2014 through God \u2014 the same atmosphere can also bring forth a Davis. It almost makes the NFL look good.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
