We must also take this opportunity to urge members of the community to guard jealously against these ills happening at these clinics. This is not acceptable,\u201d said Manana.\n\n\u201cThe DA appreciates the efforts by the Department of Health to improve security at the New Brighton clinic, but Health MEC Phumza Dyantyi must ensure that all clinics are no-go places for criminals,\u201d said Barker.", "description": "DA Member of Parliament Legislature (MP) Celeste Barker has called on the government to take action to combat the continual incidents of break-ins and burglaries at local clinics in Nelson Mandela Bay townships as a result of lack of security.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4598/fa0fc21556f54409a65bea0baaf09976.jpg", "published_at": "2016-10-19"}
