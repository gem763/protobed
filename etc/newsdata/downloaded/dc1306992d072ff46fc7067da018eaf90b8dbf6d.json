Juul, the current powerhouse in the e-cigarette community, is a small device with a lithium-polymer rechargeable battery and refill pods made of non-recyclable plastic\n\nJuul has sold over 162 million devices and has even hit 20 million in a single month.\n\nThe San Francisco company accounts for at least 54 percent of the e-cigarette market, which places it at the front of what experts are calling an environmental disaster.\n\nPatrick Diamond, vice chair of Surfrider NYC, told Tim Donnelly with Earther in an email that while he hasn't kept specific statistics, vape paraphernalia is 'now joining cigarette butts and other items as beach trash and plastic pollution which means they will make their way into the ocean as more plastic pollution.'\n\nEach Juul pod contains about 200 puffs and are not intended to be reused, according to the firm's website - they cannot be recycled either because they contain the toxin nicotine.\n\nEach Juul pod contain about 200 puffs each and are not intended to be reused, according to the firm's website, and cannot be recycled as they contain the toxin nicotine\n\nWHAT IS JUUL? JUUL is an alternative to cigarettes designed with smokers, that are looking to switch, in mind. The JUUL vaporizer uses nicotine salts, JUULsalts, that are found in the tobacco leaf, rather than free-base nicotine, that standard cigarettes burn. This is what gives 'vapers' the satisfaction that nicotine provides as well as an authentic smoking experience. Its compact and portable design with algorithmic puff consistency and temperature-regulated vapor made it stand out among other smoking alternatives and is now the number one independent vapor brand. The brand had 27 percent of dollar market share of the total e-cigarette category, according to Nielsen data provided by JUUL Labs and since 2015, JUUL have sold more than one million devices in the US.\n\nThe firm has a small section dedicated to the disposal of the refills, stating they 'should be recycled along with other e-waste' \u2013 lending no other details nor encouragement for users to properly toss them.\n\nHowever, most electronic waste facilities only accept computer recycling \u2013 primarily anything with a circuit board.\n\nJuul does offer a little more insight into how to dispose of the vape pen.\n\nThe website reads: 'The Juul device is designed to be reliable and strives to exceed our One Year Limited Warranty.\n\n'Unlike other e-cigarettes, Juul isn't disposable and should be treated as a consumer electronic device.'\n\n'Follow your city's local recommendations for disposing of a lithium-polymer rechargeable battery.'\n\nYogi Hale Hendlin, an environmental philosopher at University of California, told Earther that e-cigarettes are similar to smartphones in that they have complex computer circuitry, hard plastics, heavy metals and lithium ion batteries.\n\nAll of these factors deem the device worth of being accepted by an electronic waste facility, however, many owners do not think to take the USB-size pen to a location nor can they be bothered to.\n\nA Juul spokesman told Earther the company is testing out a takeback and recycling program 'to ensure we develop effective, innovative and sustainable solutions.'\n\nHe also shared with Eather that the firm is working with 'a number of organizations and potential partners to advance our environmental sustainability efforts'.\n\nJudith Enck, a regional director of the Environmental Protection Agency told Earther 'Most communities do not have easy to access electronic waste return programs. I'm extremely concerned about the millions of tiny lithium ion batteries that are littered or sent to incinerators or landfills.'\n\nThe latest news seems to be the icing on the cake for the vaping community, as this past August, someone lost their life to a mysterious lung disease that has been linked to e-cigarettes. Since then, 11 people have died from similar ailments in the US\n\n'The rules on electronic waste are very confusing in a lot of communities. I seriously doubt most consumers are holding onto these devices and collecting them and bringing them [to a facility].'\n\nThe latest news seems to be the icing on the cake for the vaping community, as this past August, someone lost their life to a mysterious lung disease that has been linked to e-cigarettes.\n\nSince then, 11 people have died from similar ailments in the US.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control is currently investigating 530 reported cases of severe lung illness related to vaping.\n\nOut of the 530 cases, the CDC has analyzed 373 and determined that that two-thirds of people with severe lung illnesses, or 67 percent are 18 to 34 years old, and 16 percent are under 18. The majority, 72 percent, are male.\n\nThe CDC said symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.
