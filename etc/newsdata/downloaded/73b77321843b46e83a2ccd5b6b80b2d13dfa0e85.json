Gen. H.R. McMaster, had called on her repeatedly. She shot up, wide-eyed, sure she\u2019d be fired. Trump at that point confused her for the executive secretary rather than his top Russia adviser.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cFiona got off to a rocky start,\u201d said one of her longtime friends, to whom she confided in those early days.\n\nThis account of her two-and-a-half year tenure was pieced together through interviews with more than a dozen people who either worked with Hill or are close to her. Her time as special assistant to the president and senior director for European and Russian Affairs, a role that put her at the center of domestic and geopolitical intrigue, follows the arc of the Russiagate scandal that dogged Trump\u2019s presidency almost from its inception.\n\nSince her departure, that scandal has been replaced by a new one: Hill resigned her post just seven days before Trump made a fateful call to Ukrainian President Vlodymyr Zelensky, a conversation that has embroiled him in a deepening impeachment inquiry. Her story as an unlikely Trump adviser, examined in depth for the first time here, is emblematic of the tension facing so many national security experts between their personal ambitions and their sense of duty.\n\nHill\u2019s sense that she might be fired at any moment never quite subsided \u2014 in part because she was such a surprising pick in the first place. A sober critic of Vladimir Putin \u2014 she described the Russian strongman just months before her appointment to the National Security Council as motivated to meddle in the U.S. presidential election and fond of \u201cblackmail and intimidation\u201d \u2014 Hill also hailed from the Brookings Institution, the epitome of the D.C. establishment Trump had pointedly rejected.\n\nAnd she was recruited by K.T. McFarland and Michael Flynn, who were out as Trump\u2019s top two national security officials before Hill even formally started. She had even worked with Christopher Steele, the British ex-spymaster behind the salacious dossier that rocked the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nNational security insiders were shocked when she took the job\u2014she was anything but a Trump loyalist (her colleagues weren\u2019t even sure whether she was a conservative) and the Trump-Russia probe was gaining steam and in the headlines daily. But Hill earlier this month officially departed the administration on good terms, having helped craft responses to Russia\u2019s malign behavior that, to many experts, are arguably even tougher than those imposed by the Obama administration\u2014including the expulsion of 60 undercover Russian intelligence officers from the U.S. following a Russian chemical weapons attack on British soil, the provision of lethal weapons to Ukraine, and a U.S. troop buildup in Poland.\n\nAnd she did it by following a playbook that has become familiar to non-loyalist administration officials hoping to survive in their jobs: pick your battles; stay out of the news; and understand that sometimes the wins are as prosaic as stabilizing an erratic, adversarial relationship and reassuring allies.\n\n\u201cShe understands as well as anyone what drives and constrains Russian policy under Vladimir Putin,\u201d said McMaster, Trump\u2019s second national security adviser. And during her time in the White House, McMaster added, Hill \u201cset conditions for better relations should Putin and those around him realize that their sustained campaign to undermine the United States and the West is backfiring and harming the Russian people.\"\n\n\n\n***\n\nBefore joining the White House, Hill seemed to underestimate how well Trump and Putin would get along: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an awful lot of friction [with Russia] and Trump isn\u2019t exactly the most diplomatic of people,\u201d she told The Atlantic after Trump was elected. \u201cSo I imagine he\u2019ll fall out with his new friend Vladimir pretty quickly.\u201d\n\nSuch a falling out hasn\u2019t happened \u2014 and despite her skepticism of Putin and belief that a \u201creset\u201d with Russia is unattainable, Hill came to view Trump\u2019s desire to forge a working relationship with the Kremlin and anchor the relationship in a long-term arms control treaty as a fundamentally good instinct.\n\nStill, current and former officials acknowledge privately that even with the expertise and experience Hill brought to the White House, the administration has no coherent foreign policy, let alone a unified strategy for dealing with Putin \u2014 forging a new arms control treaty with Moscow while deterring Russia\u2019s influence operations in the U.S., for example, remain steep uphill battles. And the recently fired John Bolton, McMaster\u2019s replacement, wasn\u2019t exactly an empowering boss.\n\n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t sitting around with Bolton debating what policies to implement,\u201d said a former NSC official who\u2019s worked with Hill. \u201cAnd she hints at the fact that she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on sometimes. Damage control is really her purview.\u201d\n\nIn the Trump era, that\u2019s hardly a minor role.\n\n\u201cThings certainly could\u2019ve been a lot worse if Fiona weren\u2019t there,\u201d said another longtime Russia expert and friend of Hill\u2019s. \u201cBut even if she could make a positive change and get away with it because the president maybe isn\u2019t fully focused on it at that moment, ultimately it\u2019s going to be undone by what he says and does privately.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tendency to rely more on his instincts than his advisers was initially anxiety-inducing. His off-the-cuff chats with foreign leaders and public comments \u2014 whether chastising U.S. spies, dismissing NATO as \u201cobsolete,\u201d or questioning the value of the European Union\u2014often undermined his own national security advisers\u2019 positions. One notorious phone call to Kiev aside, perhaps, Hill and the broader team began to view Trump\u2019s private musings with world leaders with less alarm once they realized they rarely resulted in actual policy shifts.\n\nTwo particularly fanciful Trump ideas \u2014 a joint cyber initiative with Moscow the president proposed on Twitter in 2017, for example, and the Russians\u2019 offer to \u201chelp\u201d interrogate Americans on U.S. soil last year \u2014 were never seriously considered by the White House, sources said.\n\n\u201cOne of Trump\u2019s favorite things to say to Putin is, \u2018I\u2019ll have my guys look into it,\u201d said a former Trump national security official who attended their bilateral meetings. \u201cBut, much to the Russians\u2019 frustration, he rarely if ever actually does. They think they\u2019re getting concessions, but they\u2019re really just getting hot air.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nHill, meanwhile, is an intense academic whose deliberateness can best be characterized as the complete opposite of Trump\u2019s stream-of-consciousness style \u2014 a product, perhaps, of her working-class upbringing and desire to distinguish herself in a field dominated by men.\n\nBorn into a family of coal miners in northern England in 1965, Hill was deeply affected by the Donbass miners strike in 1989\u2014the first major strike in Soviet history in what is now eastern Ukraine. She went on to become a scholar of Russian history, earning her master\u2019s degree in Soviet studies from Harvard in 1991, where she also met her future husband. (She became a dual U.K.-U.S. citizen after they married.) After completing her Ph.D. in history and working in the research department at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, she joined the National Intelligence Council as national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia in 2006.\n\nFluent in Russian, Hill has been studying Vladimir Putin since he came to power nearly two decades ago. Like many Eurasia hands at the time, Hill was initially receptive to Putin\u2019s self-branding as a no-nonsense leader who sought to rebuild the Russian state after its post-Soviet collapse. She seemed particularly impressed with the ex-KGB agent\u2019s diplomatic chops: \u201cStop Blaming Putin and Start Helping Him,\u201d she wrote in a 2004 op-ed, on the heels of a meeting Putin held with a Western delegation to discuss countering Chechen terrorists.\n\nBut she soon became what her friends and colleagues describe as a Russia \u201crealist.\u201d In 2013, nearly a decade after urging the West to try to work with Putin and roughly a year before Russia forcibly annexed Crimea from Ukraine, Hill wrote that Putin \u201chas never seen the West as a model for Russia. Now, he is not even interested in joining it as a partner.\u201d\n\nFrom her perch at Brookings, Hill urged the Obama administration to go into its so-called \u201cRussian reset\u201d with eyes wide open, and criticized the policy as somewhat unrealistic.\n\n\u201cThe reality is this: There are no big deals to be had with Putin,\u201d she wrote along with co-author Cliff Gaddy. \u201cOutside the traditional U.S.-Russian bilateral realm of arms control, there is no great opportunity for the Obama administration in Russia. The only quid pro quo Putin would likely strike with the United States is one no administration could (or would) contemplate\u2014where Moscow agrees not to make life too difficult for Washington, as long as the U.S. ignores Russian domestic developments and human rights abuses.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Hill found herself working in an administration that withdrew from its chief arms control deal with Moscow and regularly ignores Russia\u2019s crackdown on free speech and dissent\u2014joining some others who entered the administration with backgrounds and worldviews that seemed deeply at odds with those of the president, who repeatedly extolled Putin as a \u201cstrong\u201d leader and seemed eager to work with him.\n\nThose include Mary Kissel, a Mike Pompeo adviser who, as a Wall Street Journal opinion writer, tweeted about Trump\u2019s \u201cfrightening ignorance\u201d and criticized his approach on Syria and China, and Elliott Abrams, a special envoy overseeing policy toward Venezuela who wrote during the 2016 election that Trump \u201cshould not be president of the United States.\u201d James Jeffrey, a special envoy dealing with Syria policy, considered himself a \u201cNever Trumper\u201d before joining the administration last year.\n\nHill never criticized Trump so overtly, and John Bolton, who succeeded H.R. McMaster as national security adviser in March 2018 and was ousted earlier this month, resisted pressure from the more hardline, loyalist factions of the White House to fire her when he was appointed.\n\nBut she entered the White House with a particularly heavy piece of baggage that either didn\u2019t bother Trump or never crossed his radar: a former working relationship with Steele.\n\nAccording to people familiar with their relationship, the two British Russia hands are not exactly friends. But they have known each other for years, beginning when Hill was working on Russia at the National Intelligence Council and Steele was on MI6\u2019s Russia desk.\n\n\u201cShe had a high opinion of Steele, and thought he was very smart,\u201d a foreign policy veteran, and one of Hill\u2019s close friends, told POLITICO. Hill spoke to Steele in 2016 and discussed him with friends in 2017, after BuzzFeed published his memos outlining a potential conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia to win the election.\n\nHill told McMaster \u201cas soon as she was hired\u201d that she knew Steele and had worked with him in the past, according to a former NSC official. But she confided in some that she wasn\u2019t in a position to judge whether the former spy\u2019s assessments were accurate, and even thought Steele might have been played by the Russians into spreading disinformation.\n\nTrump\u2019s display in Helsinki in 2018, meanwhile, led many to conclude that Steele\u2019s report was more accurate than not. In the press conference that followed his private meeting with Putin, Trump sided with the Russians over the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Moscow had waged an all-out attack on the 2016 election, and seemed to entertain Putin\u2019s offer to \u201chelp\u201d interrogate Americans on U.S. soil \u2014 including Obama\u2019s former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul \u2014 about the Russia probe.\n\nThe joint press conference, which Hill had been dreading and urged Trump\u2019s advisers to cancel, cemented fears among some that Trump was in Putin\u2019s pocket and prompted bipartisan backlash. And Hill was flooded with calls and emails urging her to resign in protest.\n\nShe never seriously considered stepping down, though, according to a person familiar with her thinking, because the press conference didn\u2019t reflect the substantive issues like arms control and terrorism that were discussed in the leaders\u2019 bilateral meeting (the one where U.S. officials were present, anyway). Still, she was rebuked internally when she later met with McFaul, a fierce and frequent Trump critic, to hear his concerns about the administration\u2019s handling of the episode.\n\n\u201cThat was the one time\u201d Hill got a bit too close to politics, the person said.\n\nStill, she bounced back\u2014and her views were always nuanced enough that she was never seen as impeding the kind of improved relationship with Russia that Trump wanted. A former NSC official recalled an episode where Russia\u2019s national security adviser, Nikolai Patrushev, wanted to meet with McMaster but faced enormous pushback by the State Department and Pentagon.\n\n\u201cFiona, on the other hand, was very supportive of McMaster maintaining that channel,\u201d the former official said. \u201cShe understands the role that Patrushev plays, and that he\u2019s more important in the Russian hierarchy than, say, Foreign Minister Lavrov. So that\u2019s also why she encouraged that dialogue.\u201d\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always the Russians Hill had to worry about. When she tried, unsuccessfully, earlier this spring to prevent Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban from meeting with Trump \u2014 Hill thought the far-right nationalist shouldn\u2019t be welcomed at the White House \u2014 Orban sympathizers waged \u201can all-out war of intimidation on her,\u201d threatening her and calling her home multiple times a day, a former official said. The attacks only subsided after she asked the Hungarian embassy to intervene.\n\nNow, current and former intelligence officials, national security experts, and foreign policy veterans fear Hill\u2019s departure has left a gaping hole in expertise at the White House, at a moment when Russia\u2019s ongoing efforts to interfere in the 2020 election require a whole-of-government response. Hill has been replaced by Tim Morrison, an arms control expert and Bolton loyalist who has been described as a \u201cnuclear superhawk\u201d \u2014 a logical choice given Trump\u2019s fixation with nuclear weapons, but not Hill\u2019s first choice.\n\nMorrison has big shoes to fill among European officials, who had been able to count on Hill for reassurance that they wouldn\u2019t be abandoned by the U.S. despite Trump\u2019s threatening rhetoric. \u201cFiona\u2019s door has always been open to the Europeans,\u201d said Karen Donfried, the president of the German Marshall Fund and a longtime friend of Hill. \u201cShe was seen as approachable by our European interlocutors.\u201d\n\nShe \u201ccomforts\u201d them, too, said another former NSC official who worked with Hill. From maintaining U.S. support for the Three Seas Initiative \u2014 a dialogue of 12 Central and Eastern European states in the E.U. \u2014 to pushing for the U.S. to play an important role in penalizing Russia for a chemical weapons attack on British soil in 2018, Hill \u201chas always stood firm in terms of her policy recommendations,\u201d the former official said. That consistency has reassured European partners that there is some coherence to the White House\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nOne veteran U.S. diplomat who has known Hill for years said that Hill and her team \u201cregarded themselves as people with the responsibility to do the right thing \u2014 not to undermine the president, but try to take his better instincts and turn them into something constructive. And they succeeded to the point where I\u2019ve told European diplomats critical of this administration\u2019s Russia policies that they\u2019re gonna look back on Fiona\u2019s time at the White House as the good old days.\u201d", "description": "Nobody ever expected Fiona Hill to become a Trump adviser.
