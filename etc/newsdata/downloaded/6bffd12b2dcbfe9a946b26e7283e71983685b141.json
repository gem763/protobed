Mo demonstrated through his knowledge and experience that he has the attributes to take us forward in this area,\u2019 said Ashley Giles, England\u2019s managing director of cricket.\n\n\u2018He will be responsible for identifying our highest potential players and leading programmes that will bridge the gap between county and international cricket helping us to deliver successful, respected and inspiring England players and teams.\n\n\u2018The performance director will work closely with our network of counties to enhance the size and quality of our talent pool and ensuring that we\u2019re jointly making decisions in each player\u2019s best long-term interests.\n\nBobat will work closely with Chris Silverwood, who was appointed head coach on Monday\n\nOne of Bobat's main focuses will be to help the Test team ascend back up the world rankings\n\n\u2018We have to develop a long-term strategy that identifies the best players in the country that can step up and excel in the international cricket arena. We will expose them to learn and perform in all conditions around the world.\u2019\n\nBobat - who incorporated ideas from American sports plus Premier League football clubs Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal due to the lack of history in talent identification across the cricket world - first began working with the ECB in 2011.\n\n\u2018I am looking forward to working closely with both Chris Silverwood and Ed Smith, and in doing so, supporting the performance needs of our England teams and moving us closer to achieving our aim of being the most respected team in the world,\u2019 he said.", "description": "Bobat steps up from the position of player identification lead, having been promoted by Andrew Strauss to apply his selection principles to the Test and limited-overs teams in 2016.", "authors": ["Richard Gibson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/09/19481884-0-image-a-12_1570610843687.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
