Trump has failed to treat the issue seriously despite findings from the U.S. intelligence community indicating Russia played a role in the 2016 presidential election. Poland is preparing for parliamentary elections in October.\n\nTrump told reporters at the White House last month that he would support Russia rejoining the G-7, a stance other countries don\u2019t share.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s much more appropriate to have Russia in,\u201d he said, echoing remarks he made last year. \u201cIt should be the G-8, because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia.\u201d\n\nTrump then added that \u201cif somebody would make that motion\u201d to welcome back Russia, \u201cI would certainly be disposed to think about it very favorably.\u201d\n\nAP Photo/Petr David Josek Vice President Mike Pence during joint press statements with Polish President Andrzej Duda after their meeting in Warsaw, Poland, on Monday.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Duda expressed reluctance at the prospect during his briefing with Pence, raising concerns over whether relations with Russia could be reestablished at this point.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, over the last several years, Russia has taken actions which cannot be ignored by anyone who respects international law,\u201d Duda said. \u201cIn this context we need to ask ourselves whether this means we can approach Russia in a business as usual way.\u201d\n\nDuring a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last year, Trump infamously questioned whether the country had actually meddled in the 2016 presidential election. He later attempted to walk back his comments and offer support for U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nIn June, at the G-20 summit in Japan, Trump indicated that he was still taking the matter lightly, jokingly telling Putin to keep out of the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election,\u201d he said, smiling at Putin and wagging his finger. Putin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was also present and seated nearby, both chuckled.", "description": "The vice president urged vigilance ahead of elections in the U.S. and Poland, in an attempt to assure the European ally that Washington takes the matter ...", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6d40a3250000ad00012da2.jpeg?cache=8ushrmjuqm&ops=1778_1000"}
