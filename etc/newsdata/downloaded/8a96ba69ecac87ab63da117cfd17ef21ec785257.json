Yes, there are genuine constitutional disputes, questions about individual rights and the scope of federal power. At the same time, there are broad readings of the Constitution \u2014 ones that give our elected officials the necessary power to act and to solve problems \u2014 and narrow readings, which handcuff and restrict the range of our government.\n\nIn the past, courts have walled entire areas of American life off from federal action. They\u2019ve put limits on American democracy and blocked the people, through their representatives, from tackling fundamental issues of public concern. During Reconstruction, courts handcuffed the government as it tried to address violence and state-sanctioned racism; during the Progressive Era, they kept Congress from putting the economy under some measure of democratic control.\n\nWe\u2019re living through a version of this right now. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the Court has denied Medicaid coverage to millions of poor people, neutered the Voting Rights Act, authorized new waves of voter suppression, unleashed the power of money for entrenched interests and would-be oligarchs, and opened the door to extreme partisan gerrymandering. And while this Court hasn\u2019t brought the absurd Lochner-era doctrines that effectively made it impossible to legislate working conditions back from the dead, it has, in Justice Elena Kagan\u2019s phrase, \u201cweaponized\u201d the First Amendment to strike down economic regulation and undermine organized labor.\n\nJust to even win power, Democrats will have to overcome major structural obstacles, from the Electoral College in the race for the White House to a Senate that gives disproportionate representation to the most conservative areas of the country. To pass anything more than incremental legislation, they\u2019ll have to overcome (or eliminate) the filibuster. And then they\u2019ll still have to do the hard work of legislating.\n\nIn other words, if everything goes right for their party in this best case scenario, Democrats will still face a hostile Supreme Court majority, with like-minded judges throughout the federal judiciary. They can beat Donald Trump at the ballot box, but unless something is done about the judiciary, they will lose to him in the courtroom.\n\nThat something is to pack the courts. Yes, there\u2019s the risk of escalation, the chance that Republicans respond in turn when they have the opportunity. There\u2019s also the risk to legitimacy, to the idea of the courts as a neutral arbiter. But President Trump and Mitch McConnell have already done that damage. Democrats might mitigate it, if they play hardball in return.\n\nAt the start of his administration, President Franklin D. Roosevelt implemented restrictions on the ownership of gold, to prevent hoarding and speculation. Congress followed suit, canceling all clauses in public and private contracts that allowed payment in gold. As the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of these actions, Roosevelt drafted a speech defending his actions as necessary for the \u201ceconomic and political security of the nation.\u201d He was prepared to challenge an adverse ruling.", "description": "The lifetime appointments of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh cry out for Democratic hardball in response.", "authors": ["Jamelle Bouie"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/opinion/16bouieWeb/16bouieWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
