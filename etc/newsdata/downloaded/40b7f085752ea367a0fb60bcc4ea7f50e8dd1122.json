(Photo: Chris Delmas / AFP)\n\nThough Chastity Patterson lost her surrogate father four years ago, the 23-year-old Arkansas woman still texted his cell phone number every day to share updates about her life. But what Patterson didn\u2019t expect was the response she received on Thursday, the night before the fourth anniversary of his death.\n\n\u201cI text my dad every day to let him know how my day goes, for the past four years!\u201d Patterson posted on Facebook. \u201cToday was my sign that everything is OK and I can let him rest!\u201d\n\nIn the screenshots of her text messages, Patterson shares how she managed to finish college, beat cancer and recover from heartbreak. In the unexpected response from her dad\u2019s number, Patterson received a heartfelt message from a man named Brad who tragically lost his own daughter in a car accident several years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Brad and I lost my daughter in a car wreck August 2014 and your messages have kept me alive. When you text me, I know it\u2019s a message from God. I\u2019m sorry you lost someone so close to you, but I have listened to you for years and I have watched you grow more than anyone,\u201d Brad said. \u201cI have wanted to text you back for years, but I didn\u2019t want to break your heart.\u201d\n\nBrad went on to call Patterson \u201can extraordinary woman,\u201d sharing that he wishes his daughter could have grown up to become the woman she is.\n\n\u201cThank you for your everyday updates, you remind me that there is a God and it wasn\u2019t his fault that my little girl is gone. He gave me you, my little angel and I knew this day was coming,\u201d he writes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you have to go through this, but if it makes it any better, I am very proud of you!\u201d\n\nThe post has since amassed 141,000 likes and 19,000 commenters.\n\nOn Saturday, Patterson posted an update on Facebook, explaining that while Jason Ligons, who passed away at age 36 in a car accident in 2015, was not her biological father, \u201cblood could not make him any closer.\u201d\n\nSharing that she has \u201cknown him my whole life,\u201d Patterson says Jason put her to work at his skating rink, US 67 Skating Rink, to keep her out of trouble. By the time she was in 6th grade, he was introducing her as his daughter.\n\n\u201cAnd from that moment on he was a dad to me,\u201d she writes. \u201cI didn't share my messages to gain anything and I didn't share them because I was looking for a father, I had one and I still have my real dad. I shared my messages for my friends and family to see that there is a God and it might take four years, but he shows up right on time!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterson has not yet responded to Yahoo Lifestyle\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The woman says she heard back from the person who now has the phone number \u2014 and it's someone with a tragic story of his own.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zI.njQTaixXI_cREOlq7qw--~B/aD0zMTEzO3c9NTA4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/fe1deac0-f8ea-11e9-abf3-c683cc76668b", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
