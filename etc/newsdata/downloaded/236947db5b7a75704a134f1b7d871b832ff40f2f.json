He\u2019s still doing \u2018incredibly complex\u2019 research funded by the NIH.", "language": "en", "text": "Jeremiah Stamler\u2019s scientific work is so cutting-edge, it recently earned him roughly half a million dollars in funding from a competitive grant program at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nStamler turns 100 next month.\n\nFor his birthday, the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine is throwing its longtime professor a party it knows he will appreciate: one filled with science. Researchers from across the country will convene to discuss the future of heart health and Stamler\u2019s trailblazing work on the topic.\n\nAt 99, Stamler still teaches, advises colleagues and leads research at Northwestern, where he joined the faculty in the early 1960s. His decades-long career has focused on how diet and environment affect heart health and blood pressure \u2014 even when such ideas were roundly dismissed by the scientific community.\n\n\u201cHe is a legend,\u201d said Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, the chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine. \u201cI mean, he is just revered by everybody. \u2026 His research is incredibly complex, but he still understands it all at the age of 99.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview, Stamler said he has kept working all these years because the work \u201cjust continued to be interesting.\u201d He dismissed as foolish the suggestion that spearheading vital scientific research as a nonagenarian could be difficult.\n\n\u201cWhy should it be hard?\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cSome people think you gotta be crazy, at my age. But if it\u2019s fun, and you\u2019re productive, and it\u2019s useful for mankind \u2014 why not?\u201d\n\n\n\nStamler and his wife, Gloria Beckerman, left, at an event held in Stamler\u2032s honor a few years ago. (Nathan Mandell)\n\nStamler is a founding father of preventive cardiology, the field of study exploring how to reduce risk factors for heart disease. Stamler and colleagues discovered that measures such as eating healthier and not smoking will significantly reduce a person\u2019s chances of a heart attack.\n\nWhile that is common knowledge today, it was radical and controversial decades ago when he and his colleagues found the connection between lifestyle and heart health.\n\n\u201cDr. Stamler was already preaching these things in the \u201950s, \u201960s and \u201970s,\u201d said Philip Greenland, a professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern. \u201cHe wrote the first textbook on preventive cardiology.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Stamler invented the term, Greenland said.\n\n[At age 101, this woman released her first collection of poems]\n\nIn part due to Stamler\u2019s findings, death rates from heart disease in the United States declined by roughly 70 percent between the 1960s and 2010, Lloyd-Jones said. He added that Stamler is \u201cone of the country\u2019s unsung heroes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get the headlines \u2014 people don\u2019t know about the heart attack they didn\u2019t have,\u201d Lloyd-Jones said. \u201cBut there are so many people walking around today who didn\u2019t have that heart attack and die because of the really groundbreaking work Dr. Stamler led.\u201d\n\n\n\nStamler as a young researcher in Chicago. He would go on to become a founding father of the field of preventive cardiology. (Northwestern University)\n\nTo honor that legacy, Lloyd-Jones\u2019s department \u2014 which Stamler founded almost 50 years ago \u2014 will convene a science symposium in the professor\u2019s honor on the Friday before his birthday, Oct. 27. Scientists from across the nation will gather to speak on Stamler\u2019s work, its impact and the future of cardiovascular prevention research.\n\nIn the evening, the department plans to host a dinner featuring \u201cmore personal tributes\u201d to Stamler, Lloyd-Jones said. Stamler said he\u2019s excited for the day, and he has insisted on a \u201cheart-healthy menu\u201d \u2014 one packed with lean protein, low-sodium foods and fruits and vegetables, according to Lloyd-Jones.\n\n[A restaurant gave a birthday discount to 109-year-old woman \u2014 and ended up owing her money]\n\nIn the meantime, Stamler is busy working in the field that first caught his eye when he was a boy in western New Jersey. Around age 8, Stamler decided he would attend medical school and become a researcher.\n\nHe did exactly that. After attending Columbia University, Stamler graduated from Long Island College Hospital Medical Center, then served as a U.S. Army radiologist in World War II. After several months stationed at a hospital in Bermuda, Stamler was honorably discharged around 1946. He promptly returned to research, taking a job in a Chicago lab working on cardiovascular issues.\n\n\u201cI decided I would try my hand in research for a year and see whether my interest continued, and whether I could be minimally productive,\u201d Stamler said.\n\n\n\nStamler is still pursuing cutting-edge scientific studies at the age of 99. (Northwestern University)\n\nThe answer to both questions was yes. In 1958, Stamler joined the Chicago Board of Health to launch its first Heart Disease Control Program. In 1972, he became the founding chair of Northwestern\u2019s Department of Preventive Medicine \u2014 where he\u2019s been ever since.\n\nBy the time Stamler turned 40, his innovative work studying the connections between lifestyle, diet and heart health had earned him worldwide fame in the field of cardiovascular medicine, according to Greenland. Among Stamler\u2019s lasting findings were that the Mediterranean diet \u2014 which emphasizes fish, olive oil and vegetables \u2014 significantly reduced heart disease-related deaths.\n\nStamler stuck by his research even when it proved less popular.\n\nHis resolve was tested in 1997, when he published a seminal paper, the Intersalt study, that found a connection between increased sodium intake and high blood pressure. The research generated swift backlash and controversy, including among members of the salt trade industry, who had long argued that sodium and blood pressure were unrelated.\n\n\u201cMany other people would have dropped it or given up, because the fight was a pretty vigorous fight,\u201d Greenland said. \u201cBut not Dr. Stamler.\u201d\n\nThe Intersalt study \u201cbecame the most important paper ever published on blood pressure and sodium,\u201d Greenland said, with its conclusions eventually informing instructions published by the American Heart Association.\n\nStamler also broke ground in an arena far from research: politics. He was an avid supporter of the civil rights movement and refused in the 1960s to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which investigated people suspected of having Communist ties. Stamler later filed a lawsuit in protest of the committee, which helped spur Congress to disband the panel.\n\n\u201cHe was jeopardizing his career,\u201d Lloyd-Jones said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a measure of the man; he is unshakable and courageous.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Stamler turns 100 next month, Northwestern University plans to hold a science-filled birthday bash in his honor. (Northwestern University)\n\nStamler works part time now and is technically emeritus, but he is still a vital faculty member at Northwestern, Lloyd-Jones said. First, there\u2019s his research. Stamler\u2019s team of about 20 people is working on a project aimed at advancing the understanding of how diet, environment and DNA help determine a person\u2019s blood pressure, according to Lloyd-Jones.\n\nOne measure of his work\u2019s significance is its federal support: Stamler beat out stiff competition to win NIH funding for the project about three years ago. The program that provides the grant accepts just 16 percent of applicants, Lloyd-Jones said.\n\nIn addition to his own work, Stamler is also a prolific reviewer of his peers\u2019 writing \u2014 as long as they are willing to send him papers by fax and decipher his \u201cvery extensive and very insightful\u201d handwritten comments, Lloyd-Jones said.\n\nLinda Van Horn, a Northwestern professor who has worked with Stamler since 1976, said Stamler is a demanding perfectionist and generous mentor who has shaped the careers of thousands of young scientists, including her own.\n\n\u201cI regard him as the one and only genius I\u2019ve ever worked with,\u201d she said.\n\nStamler said he is now beginning to think about retirement. It would be nice to spend more time with his wife, childhood sweetheart Gloria Beckerman, and to catch up on his reading. (He loves to devour biographies.)\n\nBut not yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m only 99 years old,\u201d Stamler said. \u201cI\u2019ve got time.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nA kid was teased for his homemade University of Tennessee logo.
