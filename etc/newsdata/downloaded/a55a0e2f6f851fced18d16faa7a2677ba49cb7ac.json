Mr Johnson's administration has also 'paused' its \u00a3100million advertising campaign in preparing the public for Brexit on October 31.\n\nIt has also halted Operation Brock, the preparations in Kent for No Deal Brexit disruption to the Channel Ports.\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: 'We will still produce a coin to mark our departure from the European Union, and this will enter circulation after we have left.'\n\nThe cost of designing and producing the commemorative coins will be met by the Royal Mint out of its own revenues at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\nLiberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: 'This meltdown is symbolic of the waste that is Brexit.\n\nIn an embarrassing move for Boris Johnson and Chancellor Sajid Javid the coins will be destroyed after Brussels delayed the UK's departure until January 31 at the latest\n\nFollowing the delay of the UK's exit in March Mr Javid (pictured last night) asked officials if the coins could be made en masse in time for October\n\n'These coins were commissioned simply to prop up Boris Johnson's ego.\n\n'The Royal Mint should not have to foot the bill for the Tory Government's failure to meet it's self-imposed Brexit deadline.\n\n'This comes on top of the millions of pounds that Boris Johnson has thrown away on his pointless 'Get Ready for Brexit' propaganda campaign.\n\n'This is cash that could have been spent on our NHS, our schools and tackling the climate emergency.'\n\nLiberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: 'This meltdown is symbolic of the waste that is Brexit'\n\nIt is not clear how many of the three million ordered coins had already been minted ahead of the halt ordered last week.\n\nThe coin will feature the date the UK is set to leave the EU as well as the inscription: 'Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations'.\n\nThe coins were originally supposed to have the 29 March 2019 date inscribed on them.\n\nFormer chancellor Philip Hammond had planned a limited edition of around 10,000 commemorative coins to be sold to collectors for \u00a310 each.\n\nBut following the delay of the UK's exit his successor Mr Javid asked officials if the coins could be made en masse in time for October.\n\nAccording to the Royal Mint website, precious metals, such as 50p coins, are sorted and shredded before being melted down. Metals are then purified and solidified before being turned into new products.\n\nJeremy Corbyn (pictured today) told MPs last night the advertising campaign was '\u00a3100 million of misspent public money'\n\nWith Brexit not set to happen until the end of January unless MPs approve a deal, the 'Get ready for Brexit' campaign - reported to have cost \u00a3100 million - was put on hold.\n\nNo Deal planning under Operation Yellowhammer was also understood to have been stood down.\n\nJeremy Corbyn told MPs the advertising campaign was '\u00a3100 million of misspent public money'.\n\nThe PM's official spokesman said the campaign was being 'paused' after the latest Brexit extension was granted by Brussels.\n\nThe Labour leader accused Mr Johnson of wasting the sum trying to deliver his hard-line pledge.\n\n'How many nurses could have been hired, how many parcels could have been funded at food banks, how many social care packages could have been funded for our elderly?' he asked the Commons.\n\n'He (the PM) has failed because he has chosen to fail and he now seeks to blame Parliament. \u00a3100 million of misspent public money.'\n\nMore than a quarter of a million pounds was spent on Facebook adverts between September 8 and September 14, according to figures from the social network last month.\n\nThe campaign also included billboards telling people 'get ready, October 31, here we come' and messaging on bus stops.\n\nMr Johnson is attempting to get backing for a pre-Christmas election to allow the UK to leave the EU in January\n\nThe Cabinet Office did not provide a figure for the cost of the advertising campaign when asked.\n\nOperation Brock came into force in Kent at 6am on Monday, three days before the UK was due to withdraw from the EU.\n\nBut the scheme will be ended 'as soon as possible' after a further delay to Brexit was confirmed, a Department for Transport spokeswoman said.\n\nLorries heading for Europe face a 30mph speed limit on a 13-mile stretch of the coastbound carriage of the M20 as part of Operation Brock.\n\nAll other traffic on the motorway, including lorries carrying out UK deliveries, must use a 50mph contraflow of two lanes in each direction on the London-bound side of the road.\n\nMotorists are being warned to allow for extra travel time and to make sure they have food and water in their vehicles in case of delays.\n\nSeveral holding areas to park lorries have been made available if required, including at Manston Airfield.\n\nThe measures are aimed at minimising disruption and keeping local traffic moving.", "description": "In an embarrassing move for Boris Johnson and Chancellor Sajid Javid the coins will be destroyed after Brussels delayed the UK's departure until January 31 at the latest.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20320208-0-image-a-9_1572345719166.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
