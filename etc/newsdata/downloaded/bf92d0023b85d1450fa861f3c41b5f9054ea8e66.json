It\u2019s subjective,\u201d he said in response to that very question at the post-fight news conference at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cYou might not like me to think I am. But yeah, if you want to say that, go ahead.\u201d\n\nAdesanya\u2019s performance saw him assess Whittaker\u2019s timing during the opening round before he eventually connected big right at the end of the first five minutes. While Whittaker (20-5 MMA, 11-3 UFC) was saved by the buzzer, Adesanya (18-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) had gauged the champion\u2019s cadence and used that timing to finish his man mid-way through the second round.\n\nThe finish may have been a decisive one, but Adesanya admitted that he fully expects to face Whittaker in a world title rematch not too far down the line.\n\n\u201cI told him in the octagon I\u2019d see him again,\u201d he said before explaining he shared a motivational slogan he had used throughout fight camp to help pick up his fallen opponent at the end of the contest.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I\u2019m greater than I think I am, and so are you,'\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I said I\u2019ll see him again, definitely. He\u2019ll definitely work his way up, and he said, \u2018Probably in two fights, I\u2019ll see you again.'\u201d\n\nBased on that assessment, plus the seemingly imminent clash with Brazilian powerhouse Paulo Costa, it seems any rematch between the Kiwi and the Australian may have to wait until the middle of next year, at the earliest. But Adesanya also took time to put some shine on another middleweight contender who has yet to receive the plaudits some of his other rivals have enjoyed over recent months and years.\n\n\u201cJared Cannonier, I like that guy,\u201d Adesanya said. \u201cHe\u2019s a cool dude. I like his style. I like the fact that he came down from heavyweight to light heavyweight, now middleweight. I\u2019m impressed with what he\u2019s doing. He still has another fight probably (before he\u2019s in line for a title shot). It all depends on who he fights next. One or two fights. I like challenges like that.\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, Adesanya said he wants to be an active champion, and one who could eventually look to challenge the likes of Anderson Silva and the great Demetrious Johnson for successful title defenses in the UFC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about taking names, about taking out the greats of this game,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when it\u2019s all said and done, it\u2019s not about, \u2018He won that belt.\u2019 No. (It\u2019s about), \u2018He beat the (expletive) out of everyone that they put in front of him\u2019.\u201d", "description": "UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya says he fully expects to face former champ Robert Whittaker in a rematch in the not-too-distant future.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "Ken Hathaway", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "Farah Hannoun", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/israel-adesanya-ufc-243-post-fight.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
