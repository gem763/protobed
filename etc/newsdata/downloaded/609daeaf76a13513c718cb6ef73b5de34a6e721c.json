It takes you an awful long time to take care of that mess.\n\nHe continued: 'I got social anxiety so extreme I didn't leave the house for three years. Then when I came to trying to leave the house, I didn't know how to be amongst people. I didn't know how to have a conversation, I just really struggled.'\n\nIn the honest and open interview, Robbie told how his social anxiety got so bad, he didn't leave his bed for three years.

People are very open and talking about what's going on for them and their minds, and their mental health.'\n\n'It's basically the start of the process of talking about this stuff, and I'm very proud and happy to be in a society that is now getting to grips with what this is.'\n\nNow, the renowned star is in one of the most positive stages of his life and believes he owes that to his wife and children.\n\n'I have to say my \"Golden' era\" is right now and I have had several golden eras with my wife. I just started filling my shoes with me - I'm 45, and it's taken that long. The second 20 years of your life are spent sorting out the first 20 years.\n\nHe added: 'Thanks to the WW programme I've got myself in a better shape than I was in January and it's made me be able to indulge in a bit of eccentric dress wear.'\n\nYou can listen to the episode in full and subscribe to WW's new podcast, Wellness That Works on iTunes, Spotify & YouTube.", "description": "Robbie Williams, 45, has opened up about his mental health in a podcast with WW, the new Weight Watchers,.
