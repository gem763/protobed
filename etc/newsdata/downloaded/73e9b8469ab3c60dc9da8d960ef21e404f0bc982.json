(angela n./Flickr)\n\n* Frost advisory for Loudoun, northwest Montgomery, northwest Howard, and Prince William counties tonight *\n\nIt was pretty close to \u201cnormal\u201d today for the time of year \u2014 one reason it\u2019s hard to dislike October around here! The main downside was a gusty breeze, but the bright sunshine counteracted it for the most part. Winds will die down this evening, leading to a seasonably chilly overnight. More autumnal splendor is on the way tomorrow.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Winds will become increasingly calm through the evening and into the night. Clear skies will help temperatures fall quickly outside the cities. Temperatures in the 50s in most spots by evening will head to lows ranging from about mid-30s in the coldest spots to the upper 40s downtown. Frost is a decent bet in some outer suburbs, especially west and northwest of the city. Some patchy fog near water and in valleys is also possible.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Thursday): If you liked today, it arguably will be even better Thursday. Lighter winds and mostly clear skies equal fall delight. Highs will be in the upper 60s to about 70. Winds will be out of the south around 5 to 10 mph.\n\nSee Dan Stillman\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

More is in the forecast from the Canadian border in Montana almost all the way south to the Mexico border.\n\nTravel will be hazardous tonight between Denver and Colorado Springs due to the combination of heavy snow and construction. We advise that anyone traveling across this area completes their travel before 6pm this evening. #COwx pic.twitter.com/aOyK6c11bF \u2014 NWS Boulder (@NWSBoulder) October 23, 2019\n\nOne of the harder-hit areas is expected to be around Denver and to the south, where winter weather advisories and winter storm warnings are in effect. A swath of potentially plowable snow is also expected in the Texas Panhandle. All this as a new round of cold air dives into the central United States. Winter is coming \u2026\n\nA quite challenging forecast for tonight into tomorrow as snowfall is possible. As of this current forecast, the potential is there for some locations to get a light accumulation of snowfall.
