At that point, we thought she was having a reaction.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe little girl\u2019s condition quickly deteriorated and Davita rushed her to Paget University hospital, in Gorleston.\n\nThere, a doctor told the worried mother her daughter\u2019s reaction \u2018could be really serious\u2019.\n\n\u2018When we went to A and E, she started to pass out. She was scratching her body, her ears and lips were swelling,\u2019 she told the news site.\n\nLuckily, the little girl\u2019s condition began to improve overnight after being given Penicillin and steroids.\n\nDavita complained to the restaurant about their ordeal but claimed she was told that cheese had been cross contaminated with the pizza.\n\nBut the mother pointed out it was the pasta that had been the issue, adding that her daughter has never suffered such a severe reaction to cross-contamination.\n\nA Frankie and Benny\u2019s spokesperson said: \u2018We are aware of an incident that took place at our site in Great Yarmouth on September 17 and are in direct contact with the customers involved.\n\n\u2018We are conducting an urgent investigation to determine what has taken place.\n\n\u2018We have very strict policies and guidelines with regards to allergens and all our staff are trained in this area and follow clear protocols.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
