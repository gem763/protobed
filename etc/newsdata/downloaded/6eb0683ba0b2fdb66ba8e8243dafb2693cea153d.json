Their ruins are among the most visible evidence of the island\u2019s vicious circle of poor governance, neglect by Washington and environmental catastrophe.\n\nDuring the blazing summer of 2019, Puerto Rico was in tumult. Thousands of the islands\u2019 residents marched shoulder to shoulder through cities. They sang, danced and demanded the ouster of the commonwealth\u2019s negligent governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 \u2014 and, with him, the federal control board that holds economic power over the United States\u2019 oldest remaining colony in the Americas.\n\nThe crowd\u2019s ire was fueled in part by a sense of absence. Away from the echoing drums, down forgotten streets and across green mountains, the islands are emptying. Decades of abuse, austerity, corruption and now the ravages of climate change have triggered an exodus of people and money. As the summer wet season gives way to the wary hurricane watch of an ever-warmer fall, no evidence of this decline is more powerful than the islands\u2019 hundreds of abandoned schools.\n\nThe photographer Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi and I spent weeks touring these monuments to neglect. Books and blackboards rotted in the humidity. Stray dogs made their beds beneath teachers\u2019 desks. Some of the buildings had been left to addicts and thieves. In others, neighbors had refashioned empty classrooms into stables for horses, rabbits and pigs. Even in schools that remain in use, mold creeps, roofs are torn and gymnasiums sag like wet shoe boxes. Landslide-prone slopes loom, unrestrained, behind buildings filled with students.\n\nMost of the damage is the result of the catastrophic 2017 hurricane season, when Hurricanes Irma and Maria blasted through, wrecking homes and destroying the islands\u2019 archaic electrical grid. The Trump administration\u2019s dismissive federal response to the storm \u2014 punctuated by the hiring of Whitefish Energy, a small and inexperienced Montana-based contractor with ties to the administration, to oversee reconstruction of the electrical grid \u2014 helped leave Puerto Rico in the dark for months. The lag compounded the economic damage and contributed to the deaths of anywhere from 2,650 to 3,290 people.\n\nI asked a teacher at one partially destroyed school in the central mountains if she felt abandoned by the government. \u201cWell, look at this roof,\u201d she replied. Another elementary school we saw, in the western city Mayag\u00fcez, had reopened a formerly vacant wing to take in students from nearby shuttered schools. On the second day we visited, the school was closed. It was a clear, sunny day, a year and a half after the hurricanes, but the neighborhood was in yet another post-storm blackout.\n\nCarlos Conde Mar\u00edn School Location: Carolina Carlos Conde Mar\u00edn was closed at the end of the 2016-17 school year despite protests from the community. As with many schools closed during the tenure of the former education secretary of Puerto Rico, Julia Keleher, the shuttering was sudden and swift. School materials were left to the elements, stray animals or anyone passing by. The school is seen here in May 2019, after the building was vandalized and also heavily damaged in Hurricane Maria. Gym buildings (directly above) were hit particularly hard because of their lightweight walls and roofs. Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times\n\nThe hurricanes weren\u2019t the beginning of the story, though. The disasters compounded a social and economic calamity that has been brewing for over a century. It arguably began in 1898, when United States forces invaded Puerto Rico, then a colony of Spain, during the Spanish-American War. Before the war, Spain had grudgingly granted Puerto Rico limited home rule, an attempt to forestall an independence movement. But with the advent of American rule, Puerto Rico fell deeper into colonial status. The islands\u2019 people could not elect their own governor until 1947. They still cannot vote for president and have no voting representation in Congress.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s economy grew for decades, thanks to a series of tax breaks for companies from the mainland. Washington allowed the territorial government to borrow money by issuing tax-exempt municipal bonds and repay them with the rising revenues. When the last of those tax breaks ended in 2006, the economy stalled, leaving its government overleveraged and with few options. The commonwealth\u2019s leaders began issuing riskier bonds that may have circumvented constitutional protections. Major lenders including UBS, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Santander have since been sued multiple times \u2014 some have settled \u2014 for underwriting them. In 2015, with $120 billion in bond obligations and unfunded pensions, the governor was forced to declare that Puerto Rico would stop making many debt payments.\n\nUnder an agreement signed by President Obama, Puerto Rico gained protection from lawsuits. In exchange, its economy fell under the control of a seven-member Financial Oversight and Management Board with offices in New York and San Juan. Instead of forgiving Puerto Rico\u2019s debt, the board implemented a strict austerity regime, which has grown steadily more draconian.\n\nRam\u00f3n Valle Seda Elementary School Location: Mayag\u00fcez After Ram\u00f3n Valle Seda Elementary School, near downtown Mayag\u00fcez, was closed in 2016, neighbors began using it as a stable and an animal sanctuary. Police and education-department officials have tried repeatedly to kick out the animals. But the parents and children using the building want official permission, saying that will keep it from turning into a drug haven like the closed school across the street. This horse was taking a break from the sun in May 2019. Its name means \u2018\u2018hurricane\u2019\u2019 in Spanish. Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times Theodore Roosevelt School Location: Mayag\u00fcez The Theodore Roosevelt School opened in 1900, two years after Puerto Rico was occupied by the United States, as the first U.S.-style high school in the western city Mayag\u00fcez. The school was renamed on the occasion of a visit by Roosevelt, who played a leading role in annexing the islands during the 1898 war with Spain. It later became an elementary school. It was ordered closed in 2018 and converted into a depot for books and equipment from other shuttered schools in the area. Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times Don Ignacio Dicupe Gonz\u00e1lez Elementary School Location: Lares Nature is reclaiming the classrooms at Ignacio Dicupe Gonz\u00e1lez Elementary School in Lares, in the mountains of western Puerto Rico, seen here in April 2019. Lares is known as the cradle of Puerto Rican independence for its role in an 1868 uprising against Spain and still proudly flies the revolutionary flag. But it has lost nearly a quarter of its population in the last decade, one of the highest percentages of any municipality. The school, which closed right before the hurricanes, sits in an almost monastic silence; the only sounds the songs of birds in a red flamboyant tree in the courtyard and the occasional blast of reggaeton from a passing car. Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times\n\nAs conditions worsened, the trickle of people leaving for the mainland turned into a flood. Between 2009 and 2017, the population declined 12 percent, from 3.9 million to 3.4 million, according to the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College. The \u201cGreat Depression of Puerto Rico\u201d had begun, Jos\u00e9 Caraballo-Cueto, an economist and associate professor at the University of Puerto Rico-Cayey, told me. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that the stock of human capital is decreasing,\u201d he said.\n\nPuerto Rico\u2019s public-school closures since September 2017. Student enrollment and teacher employment, 2006-2018.\n\nThe exodus of money and people, including children, placed immediate pressure on Puerto Rico\u2019s schools. Soon after taking office in 2017, Rossell\u00f3 brought Julia Keleher, the founder of a small Washington education consultancy, to take over the fragile school system. Keleher, who is from the Philadelphia area, had a reputation as an expert at winning government grants. Indeed, her firm had recently obtained a $231,000 contract with the department she was about to head.\n\nKeleher quickly embarked on a two-pronged mission to overhaul the school system. She pushed for the creation of semi-privatized charter schools and private-school vouchers. At the same time, she shut down hundreds of still-functioning public schools. Defending her actions, she later said: \u201cSomebody had to be the responsible adult in the room.\u201d Keleher, who is white, also likened the fury she received from Puerto Rican parents and the islands\u2019 well-organized teachers\u2019 union to the experience of being a racial minority.\n\nRam\u00f3n Torres Rivera Elementary and Middle School Location: Morovis As in many schools across the country, the teachers at Ram\u00f3n Torres Rivera Elementary and Middle School often have to buy their own classroom materials. Several classrooms remain in ruins after Hurricane Maria hit two years ago; one building (above, left) is missing its roof. Department of Education officials say storm damage like this will be repaired when funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency become available. If this school is shut down, teachers say, children will have to go even farther on a bus across dangerous mountain roads, crossing rivers prone to flooding. Some already get up at 5 a.m. to make the journey to school. Below, inside the building with the missing roof. Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times\n\nAt the end of the 2016-17 school year, Keleher ordered 183 schools shuttered, according to the Asociaci\u00f3n de Maestros de Puerto Rico, the territory\u2019s teachers\u2019 union and Keleher\u2019s most implacable foe. The hurricanes hit soon after. As homes flooded, food spoiled and the islands plunged into darkness, millions more faced a decision: stay or go.\n\nA few weeks after the storm in 2017, I sat in a powerless, partially flooded living room two miles in from the coast in Toa Baja with a woman named Idania Torres. She had decided to leave the house where she was born, and the community she loved, to move to North Carolina. \u201cI have two school-age children, and right now there is no set date for classes to begin,\u201d she told me through tears. \u201cMy priority is that my children do not miss a year of school. My priority is to give my children a better quality of life. So right now, though I love my homeland, this quality of life that I want for my kids, I can\u2019t give them that here.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 160,000 more Puerto Ricans \u2014 another 5 percent of the population \u2014 have left since the storm. Keleher took the opportunity to further shrink the school system: Of the roughly 1,100 public schools left in Puerto Rico at the time of the storms, more than 250 simply didn\u2019t open again. Most of those abandoned were elementary or middle schools. Some children who remained have since been forced to travel longer distances to attend classes, sometimes on dangerous mountain roads.\n\nManuel A. Barreto School Location: Mayag\u00fcez School is in session but the lights are out at the Manuel A. Barreto School in March 2019. Blackouts were still common a year and a half after the storms. Children from other shuttered schools in the area, including Theodore Roosevelt, have been funneled into this school. This little girl (above) was waiting for her parents to pick her up after her teacher did not show up. Other students and teachers went ahead and conducted class in the heat and dark (below). Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times\n\nThe territorial education department was promised $589 million in federal aid to reopen damaged schools, but as of March had received only 4 percent of the money; the rest expires at the end of April 2020. A United States Department of Education inspector general found that Keleher\u2019s department lacked effective controls to prevent \u201cfraud, waste and abuse.\u201d Backlash from parents and the teachers\u2019 union finally forced Keleher to resign in April. Three months later, she was arrested by the F.B.I. in Washington and charged with conspiring to steer contracts to associates at another consulting firm. She pleaded not guilty; the case is proceeding.\n\nFury over Keleher\u2019s alleged corruption, and the gutted system she left behind, helped fuel the protest movement that brought down Rossell\u00f3 in August. It could remake the islands\u2019 relationship with the rest of the country.\n\nThough it sits on the nation\u2019s periphery, with a unique history and culture, Puerto Rico is in many ways a representative case of America in the 21st century. Look past the tropical climate and language, and you will see a landscape of fast-food restaurants, Interstate-style highways and emptying strip malls that resembles nothing so much as the Upper Midwest. There, too, jobs have vanished because of predatory policies that favored the flow of money over people\u2019s lives, with no accountability to show for it. In Fajardo, as in Flint, for many the only way up is out.\n\nBut for all those leaving, far more are being left behind; for every empty classroom, there are children left disadvantaged, families stranded and teachers and staff pushed aside. These images represent what has been lost and what more could be lost with them, but also what \u2014 as the protest movement in the streets represents \u2014 could still be gained. They are a prelude to a story that has not been written yet. Schools are always about the future.\n\nLuis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn High School Location: Barranquitas When a landslide partially engulfed Luis Mun\u0303oz Mari\u0301n High School during the hurricanes in 2017, teachers initially had to dig out their classrooms themselves. The government finally assisted with a cleanup, and teachers said officials promised to build a concrete wall to protect the school from future landslides. Nearly two years later, there was still no wall \u2014 and the danger of a landslide still looms (above, left). Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi for The New York Times Padre Rufo Fern\u00e1ndez Middle School Location: Bayam\u00f3n This classroom at Padre Rufo Fern\u00e1ndez Middle School in Bayam\u00f3n was used as a set for a music video by Xander El Imaginario, a local reggaeton artist. The song\u2019s name, \u201cEnferma\u201d (\u201cSick\u201d), is written on the blackboard.
