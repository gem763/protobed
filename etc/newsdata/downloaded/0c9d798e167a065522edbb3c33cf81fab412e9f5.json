Whilst the U.S. has denied that the move is related to trade talks, it\u2019s hard to imagine the move is not designed to provide the U.S. with leverage, given trade talks are just 2 days away. But for what it\u2019s worth, the official reason is for Beijing\u2019s mistreatment of ethnic minorities and breach of human rights. Asked on whether a trade deal will be reached this week, a sceptical Trump said \u201cCan something happen? I guess, maybe. Who knows. But I think it's probably unlikely\u2026\u201d\n\nAmbarella Inc Daily Chart\n\nHangzhou HikVision and Zhejiang Dahua Technology are notable additions to the blacklist; the former is the world\u2019s largest supplier of video surveillance products; the latter (also in video surveillance) was alleged to have released a deceptive firmware update to \u2018fix\u2019 vulnerabilities of its hardware devices, following the largest DDoS attack in history. With trading in HikVision shares now on halt, their U.S. supplier Ambarella (NASDAQ: ) slid over -12% in after hours trading as HikVision is rumoured to account for revenue to Ambarella in the \u2018high teens\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait to see where it opens in the U.S. session, but whilst prices trade below the 54.04-55.50 resistance zone, further downside remains the bias.\n\nA break below 50 could suggest that bears have retained control.\n\nThe 47.46 his is the neat bearish target near the 200-day eMA.\n\nFedex Corp Daily Chart\n\nFedEx (NYSE: ) warrants another look following the recent developments. Back in July, Huawei accused FedEx of unauthorised re-routing of its packages which led to China investigating the US firm, just one day after announcing they will draft up an \u201cunreliable entity list\u201d of foreign companies. Whilst no company has been officially added to the list, one has to wonder if it is now just a matter of timing. And, technically speaking, now appears ideal with a potential swing trade setting up.\n\nSince breaking beneath the 2016 low and out of a small bearish pennant, prices have retraced towards the resistance zone and printed a small, bearish pinbar. Whilst this may not mark the actual top, it shows a reluctance to push higher so perhaps bears can now carve out a swing high.\n\nThe bias remains bearish below 174.82 and we\u2019re waiting for bearish momentum to return to suggest the high is in place\n\nWhilst this could head towards 120 over the coming weeks if sentiment allows, we can use the monthly S1 around 133 as an interim target.\n\nA clear break above 147.82 invalidates the bearish bias and warns of a false break at the lows.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by City Index (Matt Simpson) covering: FedEx Corporation, Ambarella Inc.
