They issued a subpoena compelling him to appear on Oct. 16 to submit to questions.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to requests for comment on why Sondland had been blocked from speaking to lawmakers just hours before his scheduled appearance.\n\nThe Ukraine investigation has cast a pall over Trump\u2019s campaign to win back the White House in 2020. A whistleblower complaint about a July 25 phone call in which Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, prompted the inquiry.\n\nBiden is a leading candidate among the crowded field of contenders seeking the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nTrump has denied he did anything wrong in the phone call.\n\nThe investigation could lead to the approval of articles of impeachment - or formal charges - against Trump in the House. A trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the U.S. Senate. Republicans who control the Senate have shown little appetite for ousting Trump.\n\n\u2018NAKED POLITICAL STRATEGY\u2019\n\nThe White House letter spelled out Trump\u2019s evolving strategy of stonewalling lawmakers\u2019 demands for witnesses and documents, while questioning the legality of the inquiry.\n\nWhite House lawyer Cipollone described the probe as \u201ca naked political strategy\u201d that violated Trump\u2019s due process rights and was designed to reverse the 2016 presidential election and influence the November 2020 election.\n\n\u201cYour transparent rush to judgment, lack of democratically accountable authorization, and violation of basic rights in the current proceedings make clear the illegitimate, partisan purpose\u201d of the inquiry, he said.\n\nLegal experts said the U.S. Constitution gives the House broad discretion to decide how to conduct an impeachment investigation and that the Supreme Court would not second-guess the procedures Congress adopts.\n\n\u201cThey can do the investigation in more or less any order they want,\u201d said Frank Bowman, a law professor at the University of Missouri and the author of a book on impeachment.\n\nBut Bowman added: \u201cPolitically, it would certainly seem helpful to allow some participation by presidential representatives at some points.\u201d\n\nDuring the impeachment investigation of President Bill Clinton, the House adopted procedures that allowed his lawyers to respond to evidence and make requests for witness testimony.\n\nOn a conference call with reporters, a senior administration official said Trump had not been given procedural protections granted in earlier impeachment proceedings, including \u201cthe ability to see evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, the ability to object to testimony and the ability to call witnesses.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland poses ahead of a meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and White House senior adviser Jared Kushner (unseen) at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, June 4, 2019.

But rank-and-file members called the White House letter an act of desperation that would not stop their impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cTrump and his enablers continue to argue that the Constitution is unconstitutional,\u201d tweeted Democratic Representative Bill Pascrell.\n\nRepublican strategist Rick Tyler, a frequent Trump critic, said the White House letter \u201creads like a political press release.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be based on any sound legal theory,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018OBSTRUCTING CONGRESS\u2019\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday found support for impeachment unchanged among all Americans -holding at 45% since last week - but rising among Democrats. Opposition to impeachment also dropped by 2 percentage points from last week to 39%.\n\nAmong those who identify as Democrats, 79% said Trump should be impeached, up 5 percentage points from a similar poll that ran Sept. 26 to 30. Only 12% of Republicans and about one in three independents supported impeachment, which is mostly unchanged.\n\nTrump defended the decision not to allow Sondland to testify, writing on Twitter that he would \u201cbe testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republicans\u2019 rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public ... to see.\u201d\n\nDemocrats view Sondland as a key witness who can help shed light on whether Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden. Trump has denied any linkage.\n\n\u201cThe president is obstructing Congress from getting the facts. That is an abuse of power to act in this way,\u201d Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters in Seattle.\n\nAccording to text messages between Sondland and Trump\u2019s former envoy to Ukraine, released by House committee leaders last week, the two U.S. diplomats sought to set strict conditions for Zelenskiy meeting Trump at the White House, including Ukraine drafting a statement committing it to carrying out the investigations sought by Trump.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nSondland placed a call to Trump after a top American diplomat in Ukraine expressed concern that Washington was linking the U.S. military aid to a request for an investigation that would help Trump\u2019s political campaign, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nA career diplomat, Marie Yovanovitch, is scheduled to meet with the committees behind closed doors on Friday. Yovanovitch was the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine until Trump recalled her in May before her term was up, after the president\u2019s supporters questioned her loyalty.\n\nA second whistleblower has come forward with direct knowledge of the allegations about Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine to probe Biden.\n\nCongressional staff and lawyers for the first whistleblower are close to making final arrangements for the witness to speak to congressional investigators away from Capitol Hill as early as this week, a source close to the parties said on Tuesday.", "description": "The White House said on Tuesday it would refuse to cooperate with an \"illegitimate, unconstitutional\" congressional impeachment inquiry, setting Republican President Donald Trump on a collision course with the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives.", "authors": ["Richard Cowan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438467686&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9710C", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
