The consumer is doing fine,\u201d Dimon said.\n\nHe said that although job growth has slowed slightly, \u201cit is still positive and it may very well not go negative.\u201d\n\nThe only business to report a fall in revenue was commercial banking, where lower interest rates hampered results.\n\nOverall, revenue rose 8% to $30.06 billion, well above the average analyst estimate of $28.49 billion, on the back of better-than-expected results in the bank\u2019s bond trading business, where revenue surged 25%. Goldman Sachs Group Inc also reported a rise in revenue from the business.\n\nOppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski described JPMorgan\u2019s results as \u201csolid,\u201d noting that trading and investment banking results were strong, credit metrics held up well and that the bank managed to produce higher interest income even as rates declined. \u201cNothing not to like,\u201d Kotowski wrote in a note.\n\nStrength in bond trading helped offset weakness in equity trading, which it blamed on lower derivatives trading and M&A advisory fees.\n\nThe bank\u2019s net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $9.08 billion, or $2.68 per share, compared with $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share, a year ago.\n\nAnalysts, on average, had expected the bank to earn $2.45 per share, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nShares were up 2.9% at $119.84 in morning trading.", "description": "JPMorgan Chase & Co kicked off bank earnings on Tuesday by beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit by a wide margin, a signal that the U.S. consumer remains strong, executives at the largest U.S. bank said.", "authors": ["Sweta Singh", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441150791&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1CE", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
