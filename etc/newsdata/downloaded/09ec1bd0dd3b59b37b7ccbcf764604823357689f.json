He started the year in the bullpen but eventually transitioned to a No. 5 starter option, though Washington will not need a No. 5 starter in the World Series.\n\nVoth, who missed the cut for the series, similarly was a spot starter for Washington relegated to the bullpen for the NLDS and NLCS, but he was never called on to pitch.
