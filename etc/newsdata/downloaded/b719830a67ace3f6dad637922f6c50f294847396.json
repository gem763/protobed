Jews, for example, have held strong at a steady two percent of the population, while Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus have also managed to maintain a constant one percent of the population in the same period.\n\nThe number of religious \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 those who self-identify as atheist, agnostic, or \u201cnothing in particular\u201d \u2014 has shot up by a remarkable 17 percent during the same period, and this group now makes up more than a quarter of the population (26 percent).\n\nMeanwhile, the number of atheists in the country has doubled since 2009, from just two percent of the population to the current four percent, and agnostics now make up five percent of the adult population, up from just three percent in 2009.\n\nThe number of those who describe their religion as \u201cnothing in particular\u201d has jumped from 12 percent to 17 percent in this ten-year period.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "U.S. Catholics and Protestant Christians have declined significantly over the last 10 years, while Mormons have held strong over the same period.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
