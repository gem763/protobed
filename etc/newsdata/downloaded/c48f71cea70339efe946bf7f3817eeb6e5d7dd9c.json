In addition, a fine in the amount of 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,000) has been imposed.\"\n\nAghazada was also a FIFA standing committee member.\n\nFIFA said Aghazada was notified of the decision on Friday, with the ban from all football activities nationally and internationally coming into force immediately.\n\nThe AFC acknowledged the decision in a brief statement while refraining from comment.\n\nThe FIFA ethics committee said it was still looking into allegations against other officials as part of the investigation.\n\nAfghan women's coach Kelly Lindsey and program director Khalida Popal wrote to FIFA boss Gianni Infantino in August to say that the soccer body needed urgently to widen the investigation.\n\nThey said action had yet to be taken against several other individuals named by players as being directly or indirectly linked to the case.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper reported last November that some members of the national women's team had said they were molested by AFF officials at the federation's headquarters and at a training camp in Jordan.\n\nAghazada told a news conference in Kabul in December that the allegations were \"baseless.\"\n\nThe AFF also warned then that the report could lead to threats against members of the women's team.\n\nAfghanistan is ranked as one of the most dangerous countries for women, and allegations of sexual contact outside marriage can have deadly consequences.\n\nVictims of sexual harassment are often extremely reluctant to come forward for fear that they will be accused of adultery.\n\nThe national women's team was formed in 2010. Some conservative-minded Afghans oppose women playing sports.
