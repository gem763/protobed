Sports Direct has struggled to attract major auditors who reportedly see the company as too much of a reputational risk.\n\nSports Direct now finds itself in the extraordinary situation of being without an auditor despite having presented its last set of accounts. If the company is unable to find an auditor, then the government will be forced to step in and appoint one on Sports Direct\u2019s behalf.\n\nHowever, the exact process is unclear given the extraordinary nature of the events. A major listed business has never before been unable to appoint an auditor.\n\nREAD MORE: Sports Direct hunts new auditor as Grant Thornton quits\n\nPIRC, the shareholder advisory group, said last week that Sports Direct would be forced to contact business secretary Andrea Leadsom if it was unable to appoint an auditor within seven days of presenting its accounts at the AGM. That deadline was based on PIRC\u2019s interpretation of the 2006 Companies Act and falls today.\n\nHowever, Yahoo Finance UK understands that Sports Direct is not planning to contact the business secretary. The company is still running a tender process to appoint a new auditor and therefore does not believe the seven-day deadline has been triggered.\n\nSports Direct did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\n\nThe Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy declined to comment.\n\nIt is unclear which companies are involved in Sports Direct\u2019s tender process. \u201cBig four\u201d auditors PwC, Deloitte, KPMG and EY have all ruled themselves out.\n\nREAD MORE: Government poised to step in as Sports Direct struggles to find auditor\n\nFirms are reluctant to work with the company due to the reputational risk it could pose as a client. In July, Sports Direct\u2019s results were delayed for hours with no explanation and the final publication revealed a surprise tax bill of \u00a3605m ($748m) from Belgian authorities.\n\nFounder and majority owner Mike Ashley has also been criticised for making high-risk bets on the high street despite falling sales and footfall. Ashley has used Sports Direct to buy stakes in Game, Debenhams, and Evans Cycles. The company has also taken over bust department store House of Fraser and struggling preppy retailer Jack Wills.\n\nJohn Gray, vice-chair of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, told the press at Sports Direct AGM last week: \u201cWithout being personal about it, there is insufficient challenge to Mike Ashley on a board level.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that everybody wakes up, smells the coffee, realises there\u2019s a problem and fix it.\u201d", "description": "Sports Direct is understood to be not planning to contact the business secretary for help, despite being without an auditor for a week.", "authors": ["Oscar Williams-Grut", "Senior City Correspondent", "Yahoo Finance Uk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CBxwJUz8bsv6L.wWGdAgIw--~B/aD0zMjAwO3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d7036d30-d95e-11e9-b5ef-4216b678cff7", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
