Last year, the 5 Star-League government clashed with the EU over its spending plans, which broke earlier promises to reduce Italy\u2019s deficit and national debt.\n\nThe new finance minister Roberto Gualtieri, a Democrat who previously chaired the economic and monetary affairs committee of European Parliament, is expected to be more cooperative with the EU. But he faces a difficult balancing act, economists say. Spending cuts or tax increases will be needed to meet EU rules on fiscal discipline. However, such austerity measures could hurt Italy\u2019s already anemic growth.\n\nMr. Gualtieri is \u201cclearly a well-known name in Brussels, whose appointment signals the government wants to be pro-Europe and ask for or obtain flexibility on its fiscal plans,\u201d said Nicola Nobile, an economist at research firm Oxford Economics.\n\nThe new government has to submit a draft budget for 2020 to the EU by mid-October. EU rules require Italy to show that it is reducing its high national debt. That could once again be difficult: The EU forecasts that Italian gross domestic product will grow by only 0.1% this year and 0.7% next year.\n\nThe new government will also likely soften Italy\u2019s policy on immigration. During the previous government, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini repeatedly refused permission to dock in Italian ports to ships carrying asylum seekers rescued in the Mediterranean. His tough policy was popular with many Italian voters and helped boost support for the League to 34% in May\u2019s European Parliament elections. Critics including the Democrats and the Catholic Church branded Mr. Salvini\u2019s policy as inhumane.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear how new Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese, a nonparty civil servant, will handle the migration issue. Members of the new government know that reopening Italy\u2019s ports to rescued migrants could further boost Mr. Salvini.\n\nThe incoming government says it wants more cooperation on managing migration at EU level. \u201cWe need a new law on immigration,\u201d senior Democratic official Graziano Delrio told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe need to regularize and control the flows.\u201d\n\nThe new government is due to be formally sworn in on Thursday morning, ending a month-long political crisis in Italy that was triggered when Mr. Salvini declared an end to the alliance between his anti-immigration League party and the 5 Star.\n\nMr. Salvini, one of the rising stars of Europe\u2019s nativist right, pushed for snap elections, which opinion polls suggested he would win. His gambit failed: The 5 Star Movement unexpectedly formed a new coalition with the Democrats, despite years of animosity between the two.", "description": "Italy\u2019s new governing coalition named its key officials, including ministers whose appointments signal a less combative stance toward the European Union over fiscal discipline and immigration.", "authors": ["Giovanni Legorano", "Giovanni.Legorano Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103923/social"}
