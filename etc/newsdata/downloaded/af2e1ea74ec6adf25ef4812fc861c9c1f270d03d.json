(These studies looked at separations over a variety of time periods, from less than three months to more than three years.) However, there has yet to be a conclusive study of the long-term well-being of satellite babies. Kwong argued that generalizing about such outcomes is unfair: \u201cWhile I have seen adjustment problems due to this practice, it may not occur in all these families. And where they occur, there are other factors that play a part,\u201d such as how parents maintain communication with their children while apart, how old the kids are at the time, and the children\u2019s personalities.\n\nSome parents\u2019 goal in sending their children overseas is to acquaint them with the culture of their home country. Most, however, see it as a difficult but necessary logistical choice. Ouyang Dachun, Misty Ouyang\u2019s dad, lamented to me in Mandarin: \u201cIf I had the means to take care of my kids, I wouldn\u2019t have sent them back. Who in their right mind would delight to be separated from their flesh and blood?\u201d\n\nTina Yeung\u2019s father, Yang Zhu Yao, provided a similar rationale when explaining his decision to send her to Hong Kong as an infant. \u201cThe neighborhood we lived in wasn\u2019t very safe. We were new to the country, couldn\u2019t speak English, and didn\u2019t know the ropes to applying for child care,\u201d he told me in Mandarin.\n\nYang and his wife were also keen on having Yeung spend her earliest years in their homeland so that she could be immersed in Chinese culture and values. During the three years they were apart, they kept in touch via weekly calls, and Yang and his wife each made a visit to Hong Kong.\n\nMany kids, though, don\u2019t understand the reasons they\u2019re being separated from their parents. \u201cI don\u2019t remember them explaining it to me at that time, and I never thought of it as any different [from how my classmates were raised],\u201d Misty Ouyang said. \u201cI only figured out as I grew older.\u201d The same was true for most of the former satellite babies Wang, the sociologist, interviewed; even in adulthood, few spoke openly with their parents about the experience.\n\nRead: American immigrants and the dilemma of \u2018white-sounding\u2019 names\n\nParents across the U.S. struggle to find affordable child care, but the search is especially challenging for immigrant parents who are new to the country, have little in the way of support from friends or family, and might want their child-care provider to be familiar with Chinese language and culture, narrowing the pool of possible candidates.\n\nYoyo Yau, the programs director at the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, says that the long wait lists for subsidized child care in certain cities have prompted many immigrant parents to opt for the transnational option instead. A 2008 report from the Coalition for Asian American Children and Families, an advocacy group, noted that many immigrant parents were afraid that applying for subsidized child care would label them as \u201cburdens on the government\u201d and jeopardize their immigration status. The report added, \u201cIn all cases, the forms to fill out are not translated at all or into enough languages, often stopping the eligibility process before it has a chance to begin.\u201d", "description": "With child care hard to come by, some immigrant parents send their newborns to East Asia to live with relatives.", "authors": ["Kelly Ng"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/SatelliteBbs/facebook.jpg?1570544221", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
