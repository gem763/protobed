Government officials in Mexico City said at least seven of the dead are Mexican nationals.\n\nPolice took 21-year-old Patrick Crusius of Allen, Texas, into custody at the scene and prosecutors charged him Monday with capital murder. Authorities say he wrote a manifesto posted online shortly before the attack that used white-supremacist rhetoric to justify violence against Hispanic people.\n\n\u201cA day that would\u2019ve been a normal day for someone to leisurely go shopping turned into one of the most deadly days in the history of Texas,\u201d Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday.\n\nMore than a thousand people were inside the Walmart near the Cielo Vista Mall when the shooting started around 11 a.m. A woman named Karina, who declined to give her last name, said she was driving in the parking lot with her 7-year-old daughter when she saw a white man in his twenties in front of the store\u2019s main entrance, dressed in all black and carrying a long rifle. Karina said she heard what sounded like \u201cballoons popping\u201d and saw the gunman shoot another man at \u201cpoint-blank\u201d range.\n\nThen the gunman entered the store, as captured by surveillance footage.\n\nMiguel Rodriguez said he was shopping for a toy for his 7-year-old son when he heard gunshots and ducked to the ground. He said a person \u201cstarted shooting everyone, aisle by aisle, with rage.\u201d\n\nBritney, a 19-year-old who declined to give her last name, said she was with her 16-year-old brother and her mother in the store\u2019s underwear aisle when she heard shooting. The family dropped to the ground. Then Britney said she grabbed her mother and brother\u2019s hands and they ran out of the store.\n\nDozens of people who were evacuated from inside the mall lined up on a nearby street. A man carrying a Bible went from group to group, asking people to pray with him.\n\nLaw-enforcement officials promised justice for the victims.\n\n\u201cWe will seek the death penalty,\u201d El Paso Country District Attorney Jaime Esparza said at a press conference Sunday. The top federal prosecutor in El Paso said his office was \u201cseriously considering\u201d hate-crime and federal firearms charges.\n\n\u201cWe are treating it as a domestic terrorism case, and we\u2019re gonna do what we do to terrorists in this country, which is deliver swift and certain justice,\u201d said John Bash, the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas.\n\nCrusius had no criminal record prior to the attack, authorities said.\n\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d said El Paso Police Chief Greg Allen, Crusius \u201cwas in the realm of the law\u201d until the moment he opened fire, because Texas is an open-carry state when it comes to guns.\n\nHours after the shooting on Saturday night, as authorities continued the grim task of sifting through the scene of the carnage, many El Paso residents chose to come together at a vigil just a few miles from the attack.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to lose someone to hurt,\u201d Ashley, one of the attendants at the vigil at St Pius X Church, told The Daily Beast. She said El Paso, which ordinary feels so safe, felt like chaos today.\n\nAnother attendee, Victor Lopez, said he\u2019d been at Walmart with his family on Saturday morning but left before the gunfire erupted. He decided to attend the vigil, he said, to honor the people who weren\u2019t so lucky.\n\nOther residents said some people affected by the attack in the predominantly Hispanic city were afraid to go to hospitals or the reunification center designated by authorities for fear that their immigration status would come under scrutiny.\n\nThe El Paso shooting is the latest in a series of deadly attacks on public places. On Monday, a disgruntled employee killed two people in a Walmart store in Mississippi. Last Sunday, a gunman killed three people and injured 15 at the Gilroy Garlic Festival near San Jose, California. In May, a gunman killed 12 people at a municipal building in Virginia Beach. The month before, on the last day of Passover in April, a vocal anti-Semite allegedly attacked a synagogue in Poway, California, killing one person.\n\nThen on Sunday, a gunman in Dayton, Ohio, killed nine people.", "description": "Feds consider terrorism charges for man who wrote racist manifesto against Hispanic people before a rampage near the U.S.-Mexico border.", "authors": ["Jordyn Rozensky", "Justin Hamel", "Anna Kaplan", "Breaking News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1564858363/190803-el-paso-shooting-hero_krihaq"}
