Sean Hall and Nathan Butler, the songwriters for the 2001 3LW song \u201cPlayers Gon\u2019 Play,\u201d sued Swift in September 2018 for her use of the phrase \u201cplayers gon\u2019 play\u201d and \u201chaters gon\u2019 hate\u201d in the breakdown of \u201cShake It Off.\u201d (You know it. Don\u2019t make us sing it or it will get stuck in all of our heads.) The original federal judge decided that, since players playing and haters hating are ubiquitous, the phrases are not intellectual property. At the time, the judge wrote, \u201cCombining two truisms about playas and haters, both well-worn notions as of 2001, is simply not enough,\u201d according to The Hollywood Reporter. But on Monday, three appellate-court judges ruled that the original decision had been made too quickly, and they questioned the propriety of a judge\u2019s presiding over a case involving questions of artistic nuance. So while it seemed like the copyright lawsuit couldn\u2019t come to the phone because it\u2019s dead, \u00e0 la \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d it\u2019s very much alive and kicking, \u00e0 la \u201cThis Love!\u201d\n\nThe case will be back in court soon enough, adding one more item to Swift\u2019s massive 2020 to-do list. The singer also plans on rerecording all of her albums, including 1989, after music manager Scooter Braun bought the rights to her masters (kickstarting a feud that split celebrities faster than Ellen hanging with George W. Bush did). Which means she\u2019s gonna need the \u201chaters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate\u201d mantra now more than ever.", "description": "The Ninth Circuit has revived a copyright lawsuit against Taylor Swift for a certain phrase used in her song, \u201cShake It Off.\u201d", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/29/29-taylor-swift.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
