The long wait for their year \u2013 the Chicago Bears\u2019 year \u2013 was almost over. Thursday, in the minds of some 60,000 fans tipsy on optimism, was supposed to be their night.\n\nSupposed to be a Super Bowl contender\u2019s showcase.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nSupposed to be a sign of progress. A validation of inflated expectations. And so much more.\n\nInstead, over 60 minutes, the Bears deflated those expectations. More specifically, the offense did. Most specifically, Mitchell Trubisky did.\n\nHis numbers were underwhelming. His performance was much worse. It was grotesque. Exasperating. He missed throws high. He missed throws wide. He rifled them perilously late, or didn\u2019t rifle them at all. He took costly delay-of-games. He checked down on third and long. And on the most consequential play of a 10-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers, he sent fans streaming toward Soldier Field exits with an end-zone interception. A fitting end to a dreadful night.\n\n\u201cUnacceptable,\u201d Bears coach Matt Nagy said with the first word of his postgame news conference. And he wasn\u2019t just talking about Trubisky. No, he meant the entire opening-night display.\n\n\u201cThree points is ridiculous,\u201d he later added. Fans trudging back to parking lots used harsher synonyms.\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nBut it was the QB who provoked most of their ire. Whose failings were most blatant and most disheartening. Trubisky is one of this NFL season\u2019s most influential variables. The Bears won 12 games in 2018. Vegas expected regression. Diehards expected just the opposite.\n\nStory continues\n\nTheir case rested on improvement from their third-year signal caller. The possibility, or rather the assumption, was embedded in the minds of two local sports talk radio hosts who picked the Bears to win the Super Bowl Thursday afternoon. It was the reason a third host called this \u201cthe most anticipated season of our lifetime.\u201d The reason secondary-market tickets were more expensive for Thursday\u2019s opener than they had been for last January\u2019s playoff game. The reason fans buzzed throughout Grant Park hours before kickoff, milling about with excitement and confidence.\n\nAnd then, en masse, they made their way down to the stadium to realize that Mitchell Trubisky, at least for now, is still Mitchell Trubisky. Still an average quarterback holding back an otherwise elite team.\n\nMitch Trubisky and the Chicago Bears' offense were impotent in an opening-night loss to the Green Bay Packers. (Getty)\n\nSo they sat on their hands.\n\nThey rustled with displeasure.\n\nThey booed.\n\nThey howled.\n\nWith last January\u2019s double-doink in mind, they unleashed a half-sarcastic, half-genuine roar when kicker Eddy Pineiro drilled a 38-yard field goal to give their team a 3-0 lead. But Cody Parkey\u2019s infamous miss almost distracted from a more troubling issue: The Bears averaged just 18.4 points over their final five games of 2018. They finished 20th in offensive DVOA.\n\nThey won with innovative playcalling and a ferocious, opportunistic defense. The latter was back and better than ever to begin 2019, holding Aaron Rodgers to his lowest point total in the rivalry since 2010. They sacked the future Hall of Famer and swarmed him. Ten out of 12 times, they got off the field on third down.\n\nThey got stops. And the offense stalled.\n\nThen they got more stops. And the offense stalled again, and again, and again.\n\n\"We wanted to make Mitch play quarterback,\u201d Packers cornerback Tramon Williams said. \u201cWe knew they had a lot of weapons. We knew they were dangerous. We knew all of those things. We knew if we could make Mitch play quarterback, we would have a chance.\"\n\nWhen the Bears found any semblance of rhythm, they committed pricey penalties. \u201cWe had a third and 40 at one point,\u201d Nagy said, a tad exasperated. \u201cI don\u2019t have a play call for 3rd and 40.\u201d\n\nHe and Trubisky both spoke of \u201cfrustration.\u201d And the head coach empathized with fans as well. \u201cEvery fan that showed up from Chicago today should be upset,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have every right to boo. Every right to boo. \u2026 They deserve better.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019ll surely get better. But will they ever get good enough?\n\nThe modern NFL\u2019s most valuable asset is a quarterback on a rookie contract. It gives a franchise flexibility. Freedom. Freedom to build a terrifying defense. To stockpile talent. And that\u2019s exactly what the Bears have done. It theoretically enables contention.\n\nBut only if that quarterback on a rookie contract develops. Not when he\u2019s shaky and shoddy and, frankly, mediocre. The contract becomes a window. And the most frightening, maddening part of Bears fandom after Thursday\u2019s drudgery is the intensifying thought: What if Trubisky still isn\u2019t good enough by the time that window shuts?\n\nOn Sunday, those fans who packed Soldier Field will retreat to their sofas and watch a quarterback drafted eight spots after Trubisky begin his MVP defense. The following evening, they\u2019ll watch a second QB taken two spots after that, from the same draft class, begin a legitimate run at silverware of his own.\n\nTrubisky doesn\u2019t have to be Patrick Mahomes. Doesn\u2019t have to be Deshaun Watson. But after Thursday night, he has Bears fans wondering, just hours after all that optimism: Will he ever even come close?\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nHenry Bushnell is a features writer for Yahoo Sports.
