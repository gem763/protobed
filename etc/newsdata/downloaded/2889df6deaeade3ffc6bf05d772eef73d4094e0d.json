We urge the Prime Minister to move immediately to request - and the EU to grant - an extension to avoid the risk of a disastrous no deal exit,\u201d Chorlins added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe U.K. House of Commons voted Saturday to pass an amendment that \u201cwithholds its approval\u201d of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal \u201cunless and until implementing legislation is passed.\u201d\n\nThe legislative body said in a tweet that Johnson is now required to ask for an extension of the current Oct. 31 Brexit deadline. Johnson, however, remained defiant on Saturday.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the prime minister implied that he would request a required three-month delay while arguing against a postponement.\n\n\"I'm not dismayed by this particular result,\" Johnson said. \"The best thing for the UK and for the whole of Europe is for us to leave with this new deal on October 31.\"\n\n\"I will not negotiate a delay with the EU, and neither does the law compel me to do so,\" he added. \"Further delay will be bad for this country.\"\n\nBritish lawmakers and companies have warned about the economic consequences of leaving the E.U. without arrangements to protect trade.\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, has indicated support for a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.K.", "description": "The U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/mreportjohnson_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
