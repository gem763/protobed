He now faces charges of allegedly violating his parole, and using prohibited tear gas weapon and assaulting the crowd with a caustic chemical, according to KTLA.\n\n\u201cIt was these f***ing libtards over here, man,\u201d Mr Dempsey can be heard telling police in a video captured at the protest.\n\nWearing a short-sleeve button-down shirt decorated with marijuana leaves, he continued his thought: \u201cThese commies \u2014 I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nThe incident is the latest example of political violence in the United States, which has been inflamed in recent years by inflammatory language that has been used by those on the left and the right during Mr Trump\u2019s presidency. That inflammatory language includes, of course, frequent comments from the president himself.\n\nThe demonstration Mr Dempsey allegedly attacked was organised by an anti-Trump group called Refuse Fascism, which had partnered with the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups since 2016 to conduct nonviolent protests.\n\nRefuse Fascism pushes for the removal of Mr Trump from office, alongside the rest of Mr Trump\u2019s highest government figures.\n\nPolice told the Los Angeles Times that the Trump supports had followed the Refuse Fascism demonstrators on Sunday as they advocated for the removal of Mr Trump.\n\nThey then exchanged insults for about 10 minutes, before they began shoving and screaming.\n\n\u201cEverything went to crap,\u201d D Hicks, a Santa Monica Police sergeant who did not disclose his full name to the newspaper, said.\n\nA post by the Revolutionary Communist Party indicated that \u201cat least 10 other people got directly pepper sprayed in the face.\u201d One individual can be seen on camera being sprayed in the face by Mr Dempsey, as he is held on the ground by two other pro-Trump demonstrators.\n\nMr Dempsey has contended that he and the others were attacked first.\n\nRead more\n\nMan laughs hysterically at anti-immigration protesters with MAGA hats\n\nTrump's July Fourth speech hit by rain and historical gaffes\n\nArtist banned from Facebook for posting swastika made out of MAGA hats\n\nTeacher accused of censoring MAGA t-shirt says she supports Trump\n\nHollywood stars offer support to Jussie Smollet after hate crime", "description": "A man wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat has been charged with a felony after misting protesters in Southern California with bear repellant.The man, David Nicholas Dempsey, was a part of about a dozen right-wing demonstrators who pushed against anti-Trump protesters on Sunday, near Santa Monica", "authors": ["Clark Mindock"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GykfCmg7GtyxLPep9Lj1uQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://ssc.independent.co.uk/b/ss/indepdev/1/H.27.5--NS/0?c25=0", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
