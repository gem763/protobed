It\u2019s the worst drug crisis in American history.\u201d\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, synthetic opioid overdose deaths (including fentanyl) spiked 45%. Fentanyl can be 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. And according to the National Institute of Health (NIH), \u201csynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, are now the most common drugs involved in drug overdose deaths in the United States.\u201d\n\nFentanyl overdoses have surged since 1999.

But the fentanyl we hear about is the illicit fentanyl. And really, not a lot of people want it. It\u2019s cut into heroin, it\u2019s cut into cocaine and other drugs because it\u2019s much cheaper to make. And therefore, the drug dealers make a lot higher profits.\u201d\n\nThis is a common phenomenon for drug users \u2014 many of them don\u2019t actually seek out fentanyl but find it in other drugs they want to obtain.\n\n\u201cBy and large, when this problem started, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that drug users themselves did not want fentanyl,\u201d Bryce Pardo, associate policy researcher at the RAND Corporation, previously told Yahoo Finance. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know they were coming into contact with fentanyl. They thought they were buying heroin or they thought they were buying a prescription tablet.\u201d\n\nFentanyl is 50-100 times more potent than morphine.

And so now, the lawsuits are kind of playing catch up. They\u2019re trying to take down and penalize Purdue Pharma.\u201d\n\nPurdue Pharma, the creator of OxyContin, reached a tentative settlement with plaintiffs suing the company for its role in the opioid crisis. According to the New York Times, the terms include the Sackler family paying $3 billion in cash over seven years and no admission of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s Johnson & Johnson,\u201d he continued. \u201cJohnson & Johnson actually sells a fentanyl patch. And most people don\u2019t know this, but the man who invented fentanyl, his company was bought by Johnson & Johnson, and they still make it \u2014 it\u2019s called Janssen Pharmaceuticals. So it seems to me they\u2019re going to be increasingly held liable as well.\u201d", "description": "Ben Westhoff explored this issue in his new book, \u201cFentanyl Inc,\u201d and explains how there have been \u201cthree waves\u201d of the nation\u2019s opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7Li.2J5PiwpXmNqrwtSjsA--~B/aD05NTc7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d540cd20-dd65-11e9-bfed-b92a880d336b", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
