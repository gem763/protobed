Send a tweet to @SCMPRacingPost.\n\nThis new season full of surprises at the moment \u2026 a Happy Valley double for Frankie Lor \u2013 @HKWinningFactor\n\nFrankie Lor Fu-chuen has been a revelation since joining the training ranks for the start of the 2017-18 season, finishing second in his first term and third last year, but he has one glaring weakness on his record \u2013 he doesn\u2019t get many winners at the city track.\n\nAstonishingly, of the 135 winners in his career, just 26 have come at Happy Valley. He had just three in the calendar year of 2018.\n\nLor took just three horses to the famous venue on Wednesday night, winning with Flame Lily and Flash Famous while Turin Redstar came third in the night\u2019s feature.\n\nHis strike rate at Happy Valley is 10 per cent, which is down on his overall number of 14.3 per cent.\n\nSo why the huge discrepancy between the two tracks?\n\nFlash Famous has it for @SchofieldChad! That was the jockey's 3rd ride for the Frankie Lor stable this term... the same number as in the whole of last season. #HKracing #HappyWednesday pic.twitter.com/ccpVfoQx04 \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201cSometimes the owners don\u2019t want to go to Happy Valley,\u201d Lor said. \u201cI would like to come here more because the races are usually a bit weaker. I am going to try and bring more horses here.\u201d\n\nChad Schofield produced arguably the ride of the night to salute with Flash Famous in the Class Four Hanshin Handicap (1,650m).\n\nWhile some others seemed to lose their head early in the race, Schofield took advantage of the inside draw, settling three back on the rails before making a decisive move on the turn to push out, holding off Shining On in the run to the line.\n\nIn one of those unique racing stories, Vincent Ho Chak-yiu was meant to ride Flash Famous but had to stick to his commitment with Shining On.\n\n\u201cI tried to put Vincent Ho on but there were two sections of the race and he had one for Francis Lui and unfortunately they were in the same race,\u201d Lor said. \u201cChad texted me and asked to ride this one and I said \u2018OK\u2019. It was a great ride.\u201d\n\nThat was just Schofield\u2019s fifth win for Lor, but given the way he performed, you would expect there are plenty more to come.\n\nIt looked in doubt at one point, but Snap Fit remains unbeaten in the Happy Valley finale. Another treble for that man \u2013 @HongKong_Racing\n\nIt is very hard for any horse to win three on the trot in Hong Kong, so Snap Fit\u2019s effort on Wednesday night is worth acknowledging.\n\nAll three have been over the 1,000m circuit at Happy Valley but trainer Caspar Fownes expects him to be \u201ceven better\u201d when he steps up to 1,200m.\n\n\u201cIt was a very good effort. He\u2019s a nice horse and he\u2019s got a lot of heart,\u201d Fownes said.\n\n\u201cHe came here and then he started to make a nice roaring noise and we\u2019re like \u2018ahh, you\u2019re kidding\u2019 so we scoped him and his throat was completely gone.\n\nHe had to work for it but @zpurton seals a treble as the unbeaten Snap Fit nails a hat-trick in the finale... 3\u20e3 #HKracing #HappyWednesday pic.twitter.com/oQxblZEV7N \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 9, 2019\n\n\u201c[Jockey Club vet] Paul Robinson did the operation, did a great job, and obviously we nursed him back into form and he\u2019s had three for three now, which is incredible.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it for a while, I think he\u2019ll be even better when he gets to 1,200m. Right now I would like to go straight to six furlongs with him. I\u2019d like to bring him back to this track at 1,200m, I think he\u2019ll be quite effective with a decent draw.\n\n\u201cWe have taken our time with him, we\u2019ve treated him like he\u2019s a good horse and he\u2019s repaid us really well so hopefully we can just continue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to get a big penalty because he\u2019s just fallen in. Hopefully we can snag another race with him.\u201d", "description": "Addressing your thoughts, questions and statements about Hong Kong racing. Have something to say?
