U.S. gold futures GCv1 fell 0.4% to $1,493.\n\n\"Considering the present uncertainties around the U.S.-China\n\ntrade war and other geopolitical risks, gold still has potential\n\nupside,\" said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit\n\nFinancial Services, attributing the slight price dip to\n\nprofit-taking.\n\nThe European Union backed a new Brexit deal with Britain on\n\nThursday, prompting an uptick in Asian shares in early trade.\n\nHowever, gains were capped by disappointing economic growth data\n\nfrom China. MKTS/GLOB While markets cheered progress on Brexit, doubts will\n\nresurface if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unable to\n\nsecure UK parliament backing for the agreement to take Britain\n\nout of Europe on Oct. 31.\n\n\"Gold will be range-bound until and unless we have some\n\nclarity on Brexit and other geopolitical risks,\" said Brian Lan,\n\nof Singapore dealer GoldSilver Central, adding that he expects\n\ngold to trade around $1,475 to $1,503 per ounce over the short\n\nterm.\n\nWorries surrounding a trade war between the United States\n\nand China continue to linger, with China's third-quarter\n\neconomic growth slowing more than expected to its weakest pace\n\nin almost three decades. The dollar index at a near eight-week low has also\n\nsupported gold.
