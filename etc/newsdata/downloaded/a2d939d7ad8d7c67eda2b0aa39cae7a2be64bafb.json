It followed an equally punishing 203-run win in the first Test in Visakhapatnam.\n\n\u201cIt was always going to be a difficult challenge taking on the top team in the world \u2013- certainly under their own conditions \u2013- at a time when we have introduced a new team structure,\u201d said Cricket South Africa chief executive Thabang Moroe.\n\nCSA fired previous coach Ottis Gibson and the selection panel following a poor World Cup campaign earlier this year and introduced a new structure, to be headed by a team director who would be responsible for all team matters who would report to a director of cricket.\n\nEnoch Nkwe, a former player with a modest first-class career and a single, successful season as a franchise coach, was appointed to the team director role in an interim capacity, while former international player Corrie van Zyl was appointed acting director of cricket and interim convener of selectors.\n\nMoroe also pointed to the number of top players who played a big role in making South Africa one of the top sides in the world.\n\n\u201cIn the past two years we have had to bid farewell to some of the great names of international cricket such as AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn who between them played nearly 450 Test matches for the Proteas,\u201d said Moroe.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t replace that kind of experience overnight and we need to give a new generation time to settle.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Exciting times\u2019 \u2013\n\nMoroe said he was confident that a young South African team would reward their supporters with improved performances during a home series against England in December and January.\n\n\u201cThese are exciting times for South African cricket with new names and faces coming to the fore.\n\n\u201cOur talent pipeline has produced the likes of Aiden Markram, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Zubayr Hamza over the last few years and our development systems are clearly in good shape,\u201d he said.\n\nVan Zyl said supporters needed to appreciate the quality of an Indian team which has won 11 consecutive home series.\n\n\u201cThis is an Indian team that has been together for some time now and is well accustomed to playing in their home conditions,\u201d said Van Zyl.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe we have the players to win games and the youngsters will come right.\u201d\n\nFormer Test batsman and current Cape Cobras franchise coach Ashwell Prince responded to widespread criticism of the team on Twitter by pointing out the difficulties of coping with conditions away from home.\n\n\u201cI know we didn\u2019t play well and it seems all doom and gloom,\u201d Prince said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHowever, I do feel that people don\u2019t really appreciate how tough it is to win away series especially in conditions that\u2019s foreign to your own.\n\n\u201cIndia for example, despite touring SA with batting line-ups that included the likes of (Virender)Sehwag, (Rahul) Dravid, (Sachin)Tendulkar, (VVS) Laxman, (Sourav) Ganguly, (MS) Dhoni, have never won a series in SA.\u201d\n\nBut Prince added cryptically that there were \u201cserious issues\u201d in South African cricket that needed to be resolved.\n\n\u201cGet the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right people in the right seats on da bus,\u201d tweeted Prince.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "South African cricket officials on Monday urged the country's supporters to be patient with their struggling Test side after two heavy defeats in India.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/295509.4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
