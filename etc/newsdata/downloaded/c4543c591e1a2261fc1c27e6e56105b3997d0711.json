The BBC One soap is set to celebrate its 35th anniversary next February, but it\u2019s about to reach an equally noteworthy milestone this evening, as it airs its 6000th episode.\n\nFor a soap to reach such a milestone is a staggering achievement \u2014 especially when you consider the way in which we consume telly has dramatically evolved over the last couple of years. However, in spite of the ever-changing world of entertainment, EastEnders continues to thrive, producing unmissable content on a daily basis \u2014 much like its been doing since it began all the way back in 1985.\n\nThe London-based serial drama has certainly been home to some of the most memorable TV moments not only in soap, but in British drama as a whole, so \u2014 with the 6000th instalment set to air tonight \u2014 we thought it only fair to honour the national institution\u2019s special achievement by taking a look back at some of the episodes that will be etched into our minds for all of eternity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Appy Christmas Ange!\u2019\n\nChristmas is a time for peace, love and good will. That is, unless you live in Albert Square! The festive season in Walford has resulted many an iconic moment, but there\u2019s none more iconic than the very first, which saw Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) serve wife Angie (Anita Dobson) with divorce papers back in 1986.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s so iconic that it remains one of the most-watched moments in British telly history, with more than 30 million viewers tuning in to watch Den and Angie\u2019s troublesome marriage culminate in such an epic fashion.\n\nMarriages haven\u2019t faired well in Walford ever since!\n\nSharon learns the truth about Michelle and Den\n\nA friendship like Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Michelle Fowler\u2019s (Susan Tully) is hard to come by, but the downside of having such a close pal is that the pain of betrayal stings all the more \u2014 something Sharon discovered the hard way back in 1989 when she learned that Den had fathered Michelle\u2019s baby, Vicki.\n\nIn a special two-hander episode \u2014 the third of its kind \u2014 the truth finally came to light, as \u2014 worried about Sharon\u2019s state of mind following Den\u2019s \u2018death\u2019 \u2014 Michelle took it upon herself to reveal that Vicki was actually Sharon\u2019s sister.\n\nIn typical Walford fashion, chaos and conflict ensued, and \u2014 although \u201989 was a problematic year for the beloved soap \u2014 this particular instalment proved to be an absolute classic.\n\nSharongate\n\nHashtags didn\u2019t exist back in the \u201990s but, if they did, #Sharongate would\u2019ve no doubt been a top trend considering it was all anyone could talk about in 1994.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn what is undoubtedly one of the most quintessential EastEnders moments of all time, Sharon\u2019s dalliance with Phil (Steve McFadden) came to light via a recording which was played aloud in the Queen Vic for all those enjoying a pint to hear \u2014 including husband Grant (Ross Kemp)!\n\nSo much for faaaaaamily loyalty, eh lads?\n\nThe identity of Phil\u2019s shooter revealed\n\nThe turn of the century brought with it a new era for \u2018Enders \u2014 much of which was down to then executive producer John Yorke \u2014 and many of the soap\u2019s most renowned episodes took place during this period, one of which included the resolution to the brilliant \u2018Who Shot Phil?\u2019 arc from 2001.\n\nPhil (Steve McFadden) has made no shortage of enemies during his time on the Square, so trying to work out who put a bullet in him was no doubt a tall task for viewers. However \u2014 much like every secret in Walford \u2014 the truth eventually came out, and it do so in tremendous fashion, as Lisa Fowler (Lucy Benjamin) was revealed to have been the one who pulled the trigger.\n\nThe episode received acclaim, and the National Grid reported that the third highest power surge on record took place immediately following the \u2018Doof Doof\u2019, as a whopping 19.8 million viewers tuned in to find out which Walford resident had tried to put Phil down.\n\n\u2018You ain\u2019t my muvvah!\u2019\n\nThe spectacular face-off between Kat (Jessie Wallace) and Zoe (Michelle Ryan) \u2014 and the iconic dialogue exchange penned by Tony Jordan \u2014 went down in telly history, as Kat revealed that Zoe was actually her daughter in an episode broadcast in 2001.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut am I trying to tell you that this is the most iconic moment in EastEnders history, though? Yes I aaaaaaam!\n\nDirty Den\u2019s demise\n\nDen Watts doesn\u2019t do things by halves \u2014 and that includes dying! After a pretty iconic death scene back in \u201989, the character made a return to the Square in 2003, and wasted little time in getting up to his old cheating ways once more \u2014 something which resulted in him meeting his maker for a second time, in a death scene that was even more spectacular than the first!\n\nWith Chrissie (Tracy Ann Oberman) having ensured Sharon was nearby to hear all of her dad\u2019s misgivings, Den made a beeline for his wife but, before he could do any damage, Zoe whacked him with Pauline Fowler\u2019s (Wendy Richard) doorstop \u2014 an ironic choice of weapon considering Pauline made her dislike for Den known on a daily basis back in the \u201980s!\n\nChrissie struck the final blow, thus ensuring that Den was well and truly dead this time.\n\nMax and Stacey\u2019s affair comes to light\n\nAffairs are commonplace in soaps, and Max\u2019s (Jake Wood) dalliance with Stacey (Lacey Turner) might just be the most renowned to have ever taken place in Albert Square \u2014 and much of this reputation is down to the unforgettable scenes in which the pair\u2019s infidelity came to light.\n\nYes, in iconic scenes, Tanya (Jo Joyner) and Bradley (Charlie Clements) learned of their spouses\u2019 unfaithful ways via a DVD made by Lauren Branning (Madeleine Duggan) \u2014 a home video which featured Max and Stacey getting cosy on the latter\u2019s wedding day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother Christmas classic!\n\nDanielle dies after reuniting with mum Ronnie\n\nMere moments after Ronnie (Samantha Womack) learned that Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) was, in fact, the biological daughter she\u2019d been searching an eternity for, disaster struck, as Danielle collided with Janine\u2019s (Charlie Brooks) car during a rather sublime episode back in 2009.\n\nAn incredibly powerful \u2014 and somewhat Shakespearean \u2014 end to one of EastEnders\u2019 greatest ever storylines, and Danielle\u2019s death became instrumental in cementing Ronnie as one of soap\u2019s most tragic characters \u2014 a reputation she held until her untimely demise in 2017.\n\nPat and Peggy get drunk in the ice-cream van\n\nPat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) and Peggy Mitchell\u2019s (Barbara Windsor) feud was certainly one for the ages but, when they weren\u2019t busy slapping each other daaahn and calling each other every name under the sun, they were actually the best of friends \u2014 as proven during a hilarious episode in 2009 when the pair of legends got tipsy inside an ice-cream van \u2014 much to Phil\u2019s dismay!\n\nThe first live episode\n\nMurder mysteries are a huge part of EastEnders\u2019 bread and butter, and \u2018Who Killed Archie?\u2019 is certainly one of the best the BBC soap has had to offer. With Archie (Larry Lamb) having riled plenty of Walford residents up the wrong way, any of the mainstays could\u2019ve been responsible for his demise, which is what made the shocking reveal during a special live episode to celebrate the soap\u2019s 25th anniversary all the more delicious. Stacey confessing to having murdered the Mitchell patriarch was truly a game-changing moment for the soap.\n\nWe\u2019re still in shock tbh.\n\nJohnny comes out\n\nWhile the car crashes and rooftop tumbles never fail to entertain, EastEnders is undoubtedly at its best when it deals with character-driven conflict and drama, and that was very much the case back in 2014, when \u2014 days after their arrival on the Square \u2014 an emotional Johnny Carter (Sam Strike) came out to dad Mick (Danny Dyer) in the living room of the Queen Vic.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t part of a big reveal, nor was it sensationalised for dramatic purposes, but rather it was nothing more than a beautifully written conversation between father and son \u2014 and it\u2019s this simplicity that aided in making it such a revolutionary moment not only for the Carters, but also for the soap.\n\nLucy\u2019s killer revealed\n\nDominic Treadwell-Collins did wonders with EastEnders during 2014 \u2014 a year that remains one of the soap\u2019s greatest to date \u2014 and the whodunnit following Lucy Beale\u2019s (Hetti Bywater) murder was without a doubt his crowning achievement.\n\n\u2018Who Killed Lucy?\u2019 was superbly storylined and executed and, as a result, viewers were at their wits end trying to work out who exactly was responsible for the young girl\u2019s death.\n\nThe moment of truth came during a sublime flashback episode broadcast on the soap\u2019s 30th anniversary in 2015, as \u2014 during a live segment \u2014 Jane (Laurie Brett) discovered Bobby (Eliot Carrington) looming over his sister\u2019s corpse with a jewellery box in hand.\n\nThe nation was shook.\n\nShakil\u2019s Funeral\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a dry eye left in the country as Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) buried her son Shakil (Shaheen Jafargholi) back in 2018. During a special episode, EastEnders broke from the norm in an attempt to highlight the dangers of knife-crime.\n\nThe Walford regulars gathered to bid farewell to their fallen friend, and \u2014 whilst in the graveyard \u2014 they were joined by the relatives of real-life knife-crime victims. A tear-jerking \u2014 but highly effective \u2014 scene.\n\nJohn Yorke\u2019s return to the soap helped in restoring it to its former glory, and the knife-crime storyline \u2014 and this episode in particular \u2014was a highlight of the titan producer\u2019s latest stint, for sure.\n\nLinda takes down Stuart\n\nMuch like \u2018Who Shot Phil?\u2019 and \u2018Who Killed Lucy?\u2019, the \u2018Who Shot Stuart?\u2019 narrative culminated in an epic fashion, as \u2014 determined to free her beloved Mick from prison and get her family back together for Christmas \u2014 Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) went to extreme lengths in order to extract the truth from the villainous Stuart Highway (Ricky Champ) in a tense two-hander episode that featured award-worthy performances from the two leading actors.\n\nThe two-hander formula isn\u2019t employed all that often, but it\u2019s episodes such as this one that prove just how effective it can be.\n\nWalford Pride\n\nWalford\u2019s first ever Pride march took place earlier this year in a magnificent episode which demonstrated that \u2014 in 2019 \u2014 EastEnders still has what it takes to make history. During the instalment, many Walford regulars congregated to celebrate the special event and, with the help of Tina (Luisa Bradshaw-White), Bernie (Clair Norris) was able to fully embrace her sexuality \u2014 a narrative which juxtaposed nicely with Callum\u2019s (Tony Clay) ongoing struggle.\n\nThe Queen Vic siege\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like a siege to ruin your already ruined wedding day, but that\u2019s exactly what happened when \u2014 following Whitney (Shona McGarty) and Callum\u2019s ceremony-that-never-was \u2014 Hunter Owen (Charlie Winter) took those in the Vic hostage during an extraordinary episode broadcast earlier this year.\n\nWith a stellar script, sublime direction and a superb slow-motion sequence, the siege instalment became an instant classic.\n\nIt\u2019s been quite some time since EastEnders was considered main event telly, and \u2014 considering we\u2019re living in an era dominated by streaming services and on-demand entertainment \u2014 many figured we\u2019d never live to see the day were it would be again. This episode proved otherwise and, to use that old EastEnders slogan, everyone is talking about it again as a result.\n\nAll hail Kate Oates and Jon Sen.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "There have been some iconic episodes.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson", "Soaps Writer"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-78-4306_1569944889.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
