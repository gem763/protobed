Number two, we did not start off by dropping $10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from, into a race,\u201d Biden said. \u201cNumber three, we've been in the process of having about a third of the time that many people have had. And we're doing fine. Our fundraising is building. We've raised a lot of money online and we've raised money offline as well. So we feel confident we're going to be ready.\u201d\n\nBiden donor Denise Bauer, a former ambassador to Belgium, echoed the sentiment, citing an uptick in donations at the end of September and the beginning of October.\n\n\u201cThe digital side of things are growing; we raised $1 million just online in the first week of Q4,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to continue to grow as the campaign grows.\u201d\n\nOthers aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nJames Carville, former advisor to President Bill Clinton, said a candidate of Biden\u2019s stature should not be in this position. For instance, Biden\u2019s $9 million cash on hand is even weaker than the $12.4 million John Edwards had in the bank at this point in 2007, when he was running third in polls behind Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cIt is problematical and not typical,\u201d said Carville, who second-guessed Biden\u2019s strategy for not being more aggressive in attacking President Trump on a daily basis ever since news broke Sept. 20 that the president may have improperly held U.S. aid to Ukraine hostage in order to pressure the foreign country into investigating Biden and his son over a contract involving a Ukrainian natural gas company.\n\n\u201cHe had a golden opportunity,\u201d Carville said. \u201cIf I was him, on Day One that the Ukraine story broke, the message every day would have been, \u2018they know I can beat him and that\u2019s why Trump is doing this.\u2019 Yeah, he did an op-ed about his family being attacked and all that. But if you do this, you do this all the time.\u201d\n\nKaren Finney, a former spokeswoman for President Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaigns, said Biden\u2019s poll numbers \u201caren\u2019t a problem but they need a fundraising strategy for online small donors.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s circumstances may have gotten a post-Ukraine bounce, especially after he directly called for impeaching the president \u2014 which other candidates had done long before.\n\nIn the 81 days of the financial quarter before the Ukraine news broke Sept. 20, Biden\u2019s campaign had a daily average reported donation of $130,000. In the 11 days after Sept. 20, Biden\u2019s campaign pulled in an average daily donation of more than $296,000.\n\nStill, Biden was blown away overall in fundraising, pulling in only $15.7 million, while Warren hauled $24.7 million and Sanders $28 million. Biden spent more than $17.6 million.\n\nPayroll, taxes and insurance cost the Biden campaign more than $7 million, by far its biggest expense. Various digital services were $1.4 million. Travel expenses were $1.3 million and event-related expenses totaled more than $1 million, about the same Biden spent on media buys and production.\n\nWith a campaign struggling for cash, Biden\u2019s decision to drop more than $923,000 on private jets to attend fundraisers stood out, although Biden donor John Morgan said he had to spend the money to make the money.\n\nMorgan said he wasn\u2019t worried about Biden\u2019s standing because the field will winnow and Biden will benefit.\n\n\u201cThese things ebb and flow,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe know what Trump knows: [Biden] is the one that beats Trump for sure. If the Democrats risk nominating a socialist, it won\u2019t work in the general [election].\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But that\u2019s a time-consuming process. They say the former vice president didn\u2019t have the years to build the lists as did Sanders and Warren, a point that elides the success of Buttigieg or political newcomer Andrew Yang, who could outraise Biden next quarter if the current trends hold.\n\nBiden bundler Dick Harpootlian lashed out at the Democratic National Committee, saying its decision to ban joint fundraising committees this cycle has hamstrung the Biden campaign, which has been under assault by Trump.\n\nThe committees, which were controversial in the 2016 primary, are a mechanism that allow supporters to donate sums beyond the typical federal limits and the money can be used for discrete purposes, including travel and staff.\n\n\u201cYou can use it for administrative costs, from staff to travel, which would take a huge burden off of most campaigns,\u201d Harpootlian said. \u201cTom Perez is afraid after \u201816 when he was criticized for putting his thumb on the scales. He\u2019s put his thumb back on the scales again, by not doing what they normally do and allow folks to have these.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing catch up in the online fundraising,\u201d he continued, contrasting the campaign\u2019s efforts with Warren. \u201cShe put $10 million from her Senate campaign into her presidential campaign. Those are major, corporate, max out donors. She\u2019s $10 million ahead of Joe Biden and that\u2019s where the money is coming from. It seems to me she\u2019s again not leveling with the American people.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/bd/68/574f5a7745ae89bba908110e239b/191016-joe-biden-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
