Moreover, this figure, impressive though it is, is still a long way off Iraq\u2019s latest oil target production of 6.2 million bpd by the end of 2020 and 9 million bpd by the end of 2023. In order to monetise these flows for its hard-pressed budget and encourage further development of oil fields by international oil companies (IOCs), Iraq last week announced two key projects.\n\nThe first of these is an idea that has been mooted since the removal of Islamic State from Iraqi territory and gathered momentum after the indicative vote for independence by Iraq\u2019s semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan in 2017. This idea is the resuscitation - and further build-out - of the Baghdad-controlled pipeline that will transport around 1.1 million bpd of crude oil from the Baghdad-controlled Kirkuk fields (in the Kurdistan region) to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. This would allow for the onward export and monetisation of Iraqi oil (and later gas) into the rest of Europe.\n\nBefore Islamic State ran riot across Iraq, there had been plans to expand the capacity of the Kirkuk to Ceyhan Pipeline, also called the Iraq-Turkey Pipeline (ITP), which is a misleading nomenclature, as it actually consists of two pipes. One of these has a 46 inch diameter pipe, with a nameplate capacity of 1.1 million bpd, which has long been subject to attacks from various groups even before Islamic State, including local tribes and Kurdish militants.\n\nThe other was a 40 inch diameter pipe, with an initial 0.5 million bpd nameplate capacity. This was subsequently built-out by the government of the Kurdistan region (the KRG), initially to handle 0.7 million bpd and then, purportedly, to a nameplate capacity of 1 million bpd. The \u2018KRG pipeline\u2019 is nonetheless a fully-functioning single side track running from the Taq Taq field through Khurmala, and then running into the Kirkuk/Ceyhan pipeline in the border town of Fishkhabur. This has been subject to occasional politically-motivated stoppages, especially after the Kurdistan \u2018yes\u2019 vote on independence, but has broadly run according to KRG plans.\n\nRelated: Iran\u2019s Ultimate Middle East Power Play\n\nThe adjunct part of Baghdad\u2019s new plan, which has been agreed in principle with the government of Turkey, according to various sources spoken to by OilPrice.com, is that in addition to making good on the damaged sections of the pipe, a further smaller pipeline will be added that allows Baghdad to connect up oil output from the southern and central fields, not just from the fields in the Kirkuk region.\n\nThis idea had previously met with resistance from Russia, which did not want the influence of its corporate proxy, Rosneft, in the north undermined as swing player in determining Iraqi oil flows into Europe. Now, though, with the export route into Syria also in play, as exclusively reported by OilPrice.com, Russia believes that it has substantial control over the south as well, both directly and via Iran\u2019s enduring influence over its neighbour, and has withdrawn its opposition to the pipeline build-out.\n\nIn the same vein of dramatically increasing its oil export capabilities, Iraq has also just signed an agreement with Dutch marine construction firm, Royal Boskalis Westminster, to build an artificial island south of the Al-Basrah off\u00adshore terminal (ABOT) in the Persian Gulf. This follows the recent decision by Iraq\u2019s Oil Ministry to reactivate its pre-Islamic State plans to construct at least a further 12 full-time operational storage tanks and blending facilities in and around Al-Fao. The longer-term aim for the Al-Fao station is to have 24 stor\u00adage tanks each of 58 thousand cubic metres, for a total capacity of more than 8 million barrels.\n\nRelated: Oil Plunges After Saudi Arabia Announces Yemen Ceasefire\n\nThis occurred at shortly after the ministry announced that discussions were well advanced with BP and Eni to run a US$400 million project to replace two old seabed pipelines, including one feeding the other main offshore terminal at Khor al-Amaya (KAAOT). In terms of oil flow transportation to export, acting as conduits between Al-Fao and the offshore terminals of ABOT and KAOOT, there are now five single-point moorings (SPMs) that are capable of handling current volumes, OilPrice.com understands.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Iraq\u2019s oil export capacity is lagging behind its production potential, and the Middle East nation is now scrambling to ramp up its offtake capacity", "authors": ["Simon Watkins"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
