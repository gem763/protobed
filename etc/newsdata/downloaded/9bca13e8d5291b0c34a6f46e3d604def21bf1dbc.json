France in particular has been vocal on the subject, proposing a digital services tax which would levy a 3% tax on French sales for a select group of 30 companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon. US President Trump was incensed by the proposal, ordering a probe into whether it unfairly targeted US companies.\n\nThe UK proposed a similar 2% tax in October 2018, slated to come into force in 2020, and now-Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed support for the idea at the time. \"It's deeply unfair that high-street businesses are paying tax through the nose ... whereas the internet giants, the FAANGs \u2014 Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google \u2014 are paying virtually nothing,\" said Johnson.", "description": "Countries such as France have been pushing for stricter rules which would force the tech giants to pay more tax.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d7233c22e22af0f302aa363?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
