However now, with the advancement of technology and medical practices, parents can be assured that their premature baby has a lot more fighting chances than before.\n\nbreastfeeding premature baby More\n\nAccording to a recent framework guide from the British Association of Perinatal Medicine, in 2008 only two in ten babies born prematurely at 23 weeks in the UK would survive \u2013 but now, the number has increased to four in ten babies surviving.\n\nThe framework which presents evidence from the UK and internationally recommends doctors to take a more personalised approach when it comes to premature babies and assess factors like the likelihood of the baby surviving, its expected quality of life, and the best interests of baby and family.\n\nThe guide also adds that doctors should be looking into \u201cactive care\u201d which aims to sustain the baby\u2019s life by taking a comfort-focused approach rather than an invasive life-prolonging one.\n\nProfessor of Medical Ethics Dominic Wilkinson at the University of Oxford agrees with the framework\u2019s statement and observes that \u201cdecisions around the care of tiny infants are some of the most difficult that parents or doctors ever have to face\u201d.\n\nHowever, he also points out that decisions relating to premature babies cannot be clearly defined. \u201cIt is possible, in 2019, to save babies who could not previously have survived. That is fantastic news. But these complex decisions can\u2019t be reduced to simple rules. They need support from specialists in new-born care and obstetrics. Decisions need to reflect the evidence as well as a baby\u2019s individual circumstances and, crucially, the views of parents \u201d he adds.\n\nIn Singapore, according to the Ministry of Health, about 3,500, or 1 in 11 (out of 39,615) babies, were born prematurely in 2017. Senior Minister For State, Dr. Amy Khor, in her speech at World Prematurity Day last year explained that the survival of premature babies is just the beginning of a long road to recovery.\n\n\u201cThese babies, especially those who are born below 35 weeks, are at greater risk of chronic health issues such as hearing and sight problems, delayed development and cerebral palsy.\u201d\n\nHowever, having said that, Dr. Khor also mentioned that while premature babies and parents do face multiple challenges, the majority of the babies can go on to live relatively normal lives.\n\nThe post UK Framework For Doctors Says Number Of Premature Babies Surviving Doubles In A Decade appeared first on theAsianparent - Your Guide to Pregnancy, Baby & Raising Kids.", "description": "Now with the advancement of technology and medical practices, the number of premature babies surviving has doubled in the UK.
