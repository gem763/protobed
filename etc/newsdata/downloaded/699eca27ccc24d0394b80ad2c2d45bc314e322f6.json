He won't make Manchester United better, but having said that Man United bought Fred!'\n\nSolskjaer remains positive, however, and hopes Fred will continue to improve as United wait for Pogba's return, and also praised the club's other Brazil international Andreas Pereira for his performances in recent games.\n\nFormer Manchester United captain Roy Keane criticised Fred on Sky Sports at the weekend\n\nStar midfielder Pogba is expected to miss the whole of December due to an ankle injury\n\n'There is no use talking about who is not going to be here for a long, long time, because he is not going to come on the pitch and help us until he is fit,' said the United manager.\n\n'Paul's been brilliant and he is a creative midfielder that we need, but then it is up to the others to step up. Fred will probably take Paul's position for a while now and that's been brilliant for us.\n\n'The two Brazilians, Fred and Andreas, are going to be important for us. Scotty (McTominay) was excellent against Norwich, but Scotty is a different player.\n\n'Andreas has grown in the last few games. His energy, running and chasing, he is a different sort of No.10. He can play also in the central positions, so I am delighted with him. Great professional, great attitude. He does his job to the best of his abilities.'", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskajaer\u00a0 has challenged Fred to step up and fill the gap left by Paul Pogba at Manchester United while the Frenchman recovers from injury.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/10/20320534-0-image-a-9_1572345846158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
