Since then, two more candidates \u2014 Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and businessman Tom Steyer \u2014 have qualified, making for the most crowded debate stage yet.\n\nSteyer, a billionaire financier and first-time political candidate who has poured tens of millions of dollars into his own campaign, will appear on a presidential debate stage for the very first time in October.
