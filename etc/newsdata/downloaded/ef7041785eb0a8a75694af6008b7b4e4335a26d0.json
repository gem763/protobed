Boeing believes within a decade that one-in-five airline passengers will be Chinese.\n\nThe figure would equate to $1.3 trillion in current list prices. Boeing said associated services to maintain fleets would be even larger at $1.6 trillion, meaning almost $3 trillion worth of business could be up for grabs.\n\nBoeing has said passenger traffic within China is tipped to grow at more than 6% a year until 2038 and China's middle class is expected to double in size within a decade.\n\nWhile domestic flights are predicted to provide the lion's share of growth, outward bound international travel will also increase.\n\n\"An expanding middle class, significant investment in infrastructure, and advanced technologies that make airplanes more capable and efficient, continue to drive tremendous demand for air travel,\" said Randy Tinseth, vice president of commercial marketing for Boeing said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nChina's need for new and replacement planes between now and 2038 are broken down by Boeing's analysts into 5,960 single-aisle jets, 1,780 widebody planes, 230 freighters, and 120 regional jets.", "description": "China is widely tipped to soon become the world's largest aviation market.", "authors": ["David Reid"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106133573-1568718655493gettyimages-1148088706.jpeg?v=1568718723", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
