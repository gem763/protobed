I\u2019m not going to respond to that.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Joe Biden explodes when a reporter asks a very simple question: \"How was your role as Vice President in charge of policy in Ukraine and your son's job in Ukraine, how is that not a conflict of interest?\" Biden: \"I'm not going to respond to that!\" What is he hiding? pic.twitter.com/jbycKLARhE \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) October 4, 2019\n\nThe question regarding the potential conflict of interest came only hours after the newly appointed Ukrainian Prosecutor General announced he was reviewing allegations of criminal conduct against Burisma.\n\nHunter Biden joined the company\u2019s board of directors in April 2014, despitehaving no prior background in either the energy industry or Ukraine. As Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friend, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month, around the same time his father was tapped to lead the Obama administration\u2019s policy in Ukraine.\n\nThe timing of Hunter Biden\u2019s ascension to Burisma\u2019s board immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe concerning conflicts of interest. Adding to the ethical cloud over that appointment was that Mykola Zlochevsky, Burisma\u2019s founder, had his assets seized in the United Kingdom for suspicion of money laundering. Many have speculated Hunter Biden\u2019s position on Burisma\u2019s board was an attempt by Zlochevsky to curry favor with western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of his business dealings.\n\nSuch a brazen attempt would not be totally ill-suited for Zlochevsky. The Burisma founder is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s top oligarchs, a position obtained while serving in the Ukrainian government under former President Viktor Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was during his tenure in government as Ukraine\u2019s minister of natural resources that Burisma received its oil and gas licenses.\n\nIt is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016. Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption.\n\nUnofficially, though, it was well known Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster, he was warned to back off of the matter. Regardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky\n\nSince President Donald Trump suggested the matter be looked into by Ukraine, an action that launched an impeachment inquiry by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, Biden has worked to minimize his role in the entire proceeding. Part of that strategy has been to pivot the conversation away from Hunter Biden and Burisma by accusing Trump of abusing his power in suggesting Ukraine probe the issue.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem, focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done,\u201d Biden told the media on Friday.", "description": "Former Vice President Joe Biden exploded at the media on Friday when asked about his youngest son's shadowy business dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Biden-Not-Going-to-Respond-to-That-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
