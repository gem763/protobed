A source close to Wallace, however, claimed the Fox News anchor was not referring to his colleagues when he referenced the spin coming for the president\u2019s defenders.\n\nAfter Wallace spent several minutes laying out just how credible the whistleblower complaint has proven to be so far\u2014and praising him or her for going through proper channels, Smith attempted to point out \u201cmajor inconsistencies,\u201d echoing White House talking points directly as she claimed there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d in the phone call.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think that dirt on Joe Biden and Joe Biden\u2019s son is a thing of value?\u201d Wallace asked. As she tried to interrupt him, he continued, \u201cYou asked me a question, let me answer it, Sandra.\u201d Wallace said he doesn\u2019t necessarily believe there is a \u201chot solid case\u201d for the president to be impeached, \u201cbut what is clear from reading the complaint is that it is a serious allegation\u201d and that \u201ca lot of it has proven to be borne out already.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo dismiss this as a political hack,\u201d Wallace said, as Trump and his Fox News loyalists have done, \u201cseems to be to be an effort by the president\u2019s defenders to make nothing out of something, and there is something here.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor all of the efforts of a lot of people defending the president to pretend this is nothing, it\u2019s not nothing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s something.\u201d\n\nThen, after Smith casually quoted Trump calling those who helped the whistleblower \u201cclose to spies,\u201d Wallace stopped her in her tracks.\n\n\u201cCan I say something about that?\u201d he said. \u201cThat is very, deeply troubling. These are people inside an administration that are saying that something was going on that they were very, deeply troubled by.\u201d He said, \u201cTo call them spies and to suggest that perhaps we should deal with them the way we\u2019ve dealt with other people, with treason, which is in effect to execute them, really seems to be to strike at the very heart of what whistleblowers are all about.\u201d\n\nFinally, in teasing his Fox News Sunday show for this weekend, Wallace said he \u201chopes\u201d he\u2019ll have someone on from the White House who can address the scandal, but so far no one has agreed to appear.", "description": "The \u2018Fox News Sunday\u2019 host clashed with colleague Sandra Smith after she echoed White House talking points on the whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1437,w_2554,x_2,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569602551/CW_fsgiey", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
