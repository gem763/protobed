However, the majority of the cod sold in Britain is from other stocks.\n\nWith Brexit looming there are significant changes expected to the management of the UK\u2019s fisheries, with Britain assuming more responsibility for managing stocks within its seas. The guide notes \u201cit is more important than ever for consumers to pay close attention to how our UK fisheries and fish farms are doing, and to support sustainable UK seafood\u201d.\n\nCharlotte Coombes, the MCS Good Fish Guide manager, said: \u201cUK-caught or farmed seafood can be a great sustainable option when done right, but it is vital that people take note of what species they\u2019re buying, where it was caught or farmed, and how. MCS\u2019s Good Fish Guide looks at all of these key aspects, as well as wider environmental impacts and how well-regulated the farms and fisheries are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU, shopping for sustainable UK seafood will help to support sustainable UK fishers and fish farmers and reduce the pressure on at-risk species.\u201d\n\nConsumers determined to have a cod supper are advised to look for fish from the north-east Arctic or Iceland. Also to be shunned is European eel, a critically endangered species due to overfishing, habitat changes and pollution. Whether farmed or caught wild, the MCS warns there are currently no sustainable options for this species.\n\nConsumers are also urged not to buy or eat wild Atlantic salmon, given that there are no rivers in England or Wales where salmon stocks are meeting conservation targets and only 28% of rivers in Scotland doing so. Shoppers are advised to look for UK organic farmed salmon or fish from Scottish grade-one rivers.\n\nWhere did all the cod go? Fishing crisis in the North Sea Read more\n\nWhiting caught from the west of the UK should also be avoided, given that all its populations are below safe levels. Wild Atlantic halibut \u2013 an \u201camazing but endangered species\u201d \u2013 is highly vulnerable to the impact of fishing, so consumers are urged to avoid wild Atlantic halibut caught anywhere in UK waters.\n\nAmong the most sustainable seafood species caught or farmed in the UK are herring (from the Irish or North Sea) where the population is in a good state, while oysters, mussels and king prawns are singled out as the tasty UK-farmed shellfish hailed as \u201creal delicacies on our doorstep\u201d.\n\nPlaice is recommended as populations are booming, as is UK-farmed Atlantic halibut, but not the endangered wild species. Following low stock levels in 2006, UK-caught European hake populations have bounced back and been consistently high over the past 10 years.\n\n\u201cWhatever the future of the UK\u2019s relationship with the EU\u201d said Coombes, \u201cshopping for sustainable UK seafood will help to support sustainable UK fishers and fish farmers and reduce the pressure on at-risk species.\u201d", "description": "Exclusive: species added to at-risk list as numbers fall, but hake and plaice are booming", "authors": ["Rebecca Smithers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9574941ddf877959eab1186f708c3b43369e4b8f/0_0_3024_1814/master/3024.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=702124d7d90f15f79bdf2cc663b8d39b"}
