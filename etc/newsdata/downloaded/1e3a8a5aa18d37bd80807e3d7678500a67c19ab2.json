The Communist regime which then took power did little to uncover the killings of Jews.\n\nRomania was home to 750,000 Jews before the war, but only 8,000-10,000 remain today.", "description": "Romania gives green light for Holocaust museum", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/wires/05/28/20/16/1000x563_romania-gives-green-light-for-holocaust-museum.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
