They watch footage of riot police advancing towards protestors. After 16 weeks of protests, many in the audience know this type of scene well.\n\nThey are gathered \u2014 along with people at about a dozen street corners, parks and other public spaces across Hong Kong \u2014 for screenings of Winter on Fire: Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Freedom, an Oscar-nominated documentary about Ukraine\u2019s anti-government protests of 2013. The three-month-long protest, centered on a square in the capital Kyiv, successfully toppled the country\u2019s pro-Russia leadership.\n\nHongkongers are drawing parallels between the Euromaidan movement, as Ukraine\u2019s uprising was called, and their own struggle for democracy. Both were sparked by a single controversy \u2014 in Hong Kong, a detested (and now withdrawn) extradition bill, in Ukraine, the president\u2019s refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union. But each quickly snowballed to include much broader demands for greater political freedom.\n\nThe overall political situation in the movie resonates with Hongkongers, as Kenneth Chan, a political science professor at Hong Kong Baptist University points out.\n\n\u201cUkrainian protestors felt that their leaders were puppets of the Russian government, in the way that many in Hong Kong see theirs as puppets of Beijing,\u201d he tells TIME.\n\nThe pace of both movements also has similarities.\n\n\u201cThe way the protests developed in Ukraine is very similar to in Hong Kong, starting out peacefully and then becoming more and more radical and extreme,\u201d says Hansa, a 23-year-old protestor who organized a screening of Winter on Fire, and who, like many here, believes that Euromaidan is a case study to learn from.\n\nThere are other parallels. The white-shirted gangs and other pro-government groups beating up democracy protesters in Hong Kong have incited comparisons to Ukraine\u2019s titushki \u2014 hired thugs who, Winter on Fire, are shown joining forces with the police.\n\nThe phrase heard throughout the movie, \u201cGlory to Ukraine,\u201d may have even inspired \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\u201d an original song that was produced by singers, instrumentalists and sound engineers collaborating online. Some have branded it Hong Kong\u2019s new \u201cnational anthem.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder that the director of Winter on Fire, Evgeny Afineevsky, penned an open letter of encouragement to Hong Kong\u2019s protestors, declaring that \u201chope truly lies in the hands of today\u2019s younger generations.\u201d\n\nMany of the city\u2019s activists are certainly taking inspiration from Afineevsky\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWinter on Fire shows us that we may suffer difficulties now, but success will finally come if we insist on the fight. It inspires us to continue,\u201d says Isaac Cheng, vice-chair of Demosisto, the political party founded by Hong Kong\u2019s youthful democratic figurehead Joshua Wong.\n\nSome have blamed the film \u2014 with its graphic scenes of protestors burning tires and setting the city center ablaze \u2014 of radicalizing protestors. In a recently published op-ed pro-establishment lawmaker Regina Ip wrote: \u201cThe forces driving the widespread upheaval are complex. We have young protesters imagining themselves as agents of change, as in the documentary Winter on Fire: Ukraine\u2019s Fight for Freedom.\u201d\n\nThe accusation is rebuffed by the movie\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cThe focus of the film is not the violence or the rioting,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cIt is the struggle for democracy, the care and love among protestors, and their willingness to sacrifice for their land.\u201d\n\nOther are meanwhile quick to point out that the use of force by Hong Kong police has been relatively restrained. In Ukraine, after tear gas and rubber bullets failed to disperse protestors, police used stun grenades and live rounds, with over almost 130 deaths recorded. In Hong Kong, live rounds have only been fired in warning (although one police association is beginning to advocate the use of live ammunition if officers continue to be attacked by protesters with petrol bombs).\n\nThe Hong Kong movement also looks set for a longer fight. The demonstrations came to an end in Ukraine after 93 days, when the country\u2019s unpopular president, Viktor Yanukovych, fled to Russia and general elections were announced. Protests in Hong Kong have meanwhile surpassed their hundredth day and show no signs of abating. Perhaps Hong Kong\u2019s summer of unrest will turn into its own winter on fire.\n\n\u201cHongkongers need to be prepared,\u201d a 38-year-old protestor tells TIME. \u201cThis is going to be a long, uphill battle.\u201d\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.", "description": "Hong Kong's young activists have been gripped by 'Winter on Fire,' an Oscar-nominated documentary about Ukraine's 2013 protests.", "authors": ["Hillary Leung", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-512175284.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C3669px%2C1920px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
