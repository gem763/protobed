Still, breadth was not bad with 3,400 gainers to 3,900 decliners and stocks bounced back nicely in the afternoon following a midday dip.\n\nThe biggest problem Friday was that a trio of stocks in the DJIA struggled. Boeing (BA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were the primary problem and American Express (AXP) added to the pressure with a negative response to its earnings report.\n\nThe indices have run for most of the week after a \"sell the news\" reaction following the China trade deal that never materialized. Good bank earnings helped to provide some upside and individual stock-picking improved nicely with small-caps leading. The action Friday looked like some routine profit-taking and repositioning as we head into big earnings news next week. No technical damage was done and a good trading range is developing.\n\nIn the week ahead there are a number of major reports which will give us our first real feel for the market mood. Of particularly interest will be Intel (INTC) , Amazon (AMZN) , and Microsoft (MSFT) .\n\nI was encouraged this week by better action in individual stocks, which helps to provide some good setups heading into the various earnings reports. The potential for a test of the September highs looks good but the risk of headlines on China, the economy and the Fed will give the bears plenty of reason for pessimism.\n\nThere was a refreshing change in the character of the market this week and a pause Friday. It is a good foundation for more positive action next week.\n\nHave a good evening. I'll see you on Monday.", "description": "3 Earnings Reports Will Be Key for the Market Next Week...BA", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Earnings Reports Will Be Key For The Market Next Week", "There Is A Good Foundation For More Positive Action In The Week Ahead.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bruce Kamich", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Doug Kass"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/70d1b679-4d7e-11e8-a2db-d5283b1c687b.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
