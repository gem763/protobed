A U.S. Army official \"briefed on the results of the operation\" told Newsweek that Baghdadi had died.\n\nThe reports surfaced soon after President Trump posted a cryptic tweet at 9:23 p.m. saying something \"very big has just happened!\" and the White House said it would make a \"major statement\" on Sunday at 9 a.m.\n\nThe big picture: Just last month, an audio message from Baghdadi emerged in which he called on followers to redouble efforts to further the mission of ISIS in an effort to boost the extremist group after it lost control of territories in Iraq and Syria this year.\n\nEditor's note: This is a developing news story.
