The book also details the findings of 35 commissions looking into the atrocities and lists the locations of three dozen mass graves in Iran.\n\nThe Mujahedin-e Khalq, or MEK, has emerged as a leading expatriate dissident group battling the Iranian regime. The book released Wednesday claims that as many as 30,000 political prisoners and opposition figures were killed in Iran in 1988, though organizations including Amnesty International list lower totals.\n\nThe majority of those killed in 1988 were members of the MEK. MEK leader Maryam Rajavi was the event\u2019s keynote speaker, where she called for a \u201cfirm European policy which necessarily requires lending support to the Iranian people\u2019s resistance [in order] to establish democracy and popular sovereignty\u201d in Iran.\n\nMs. Rajavi said that recent events, which include confrontation with tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz and an attack on a major petroleum refinery in Saudi Arabia, are proof that her warning to the European Parliament two years ago was coming true: \u201cI warned then that \u2018if the ruling religious fascism in Iran is not dealt with decisively, they will impose a fatal war on the region and the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nIran has denied its role in the events Ms. Rajavi mentioned.\n\nSeveral dozen EU parliamentarians attended event for the release of the book, which was held in a committee meeting room at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.\n\nAnna Fotyga, a Polish member of the legislature and a former minister of foreign affairs who chaired Wednesday\u2019s proceedings, called on the European Union to \u201cfocus on human rights abuses when it comes to relations with Iran.\u201d\n\nPatrizia Toia, a member of parliament from Italy, told Ms. Rajavi, \u201cYou have our full support in your struggle to achieve freedom and democracy for your people.\u201d\n\nAndrea Dessi, a senior fellow with the Institute for International Affairs, a Rome-based think tank, said events like the one on Wednesday could help push the European Union into more of a hard-line stance toward Iran that is more in line with that of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to see a policy shift on Iran from one day to the next,\u201d Mr. Dessi said in an interview. \u201cThis was a relatively low-key event, but it\u2019s still significant that it took place and that it was well attended even as the European Union is focused on Brexit and what is taking place on the Turkey-Syria border.\u201d\n\nThe event also took place the same day police in Albania said they foiled the plans by an Iranian paramilitary network that reportedly had plans to attack the MEK\u2019s main base in that country.\n\nMEK constructed its \u201cAshraf-3\u201d base in what had been Albanian pastureland over the past three years, after previous bases in Iraq were abandoned for safety reasons. It was the second reported plot to attack the Ashraf-3 base thwarted by Albanian officials in less than eight months.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
