Online video usage among teens is going through the roof, survey says", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nIt\u2019s not going to shock any of you with teens and tweens that your kids are rather obsessed with technology. But do you have a good handle on just how they\u2019re engaged with different types of media and how much time they\u2019re actively spending on their devices?\n\nTo get at the heart of it, the nonprofit advocacy for kids and families Common Sense Media surveyed more than 1,600 kids in the U.S. between 8 and 18, a follow-up to a similar survey in 2015.\n\nAmong the top-level results \u2013 again, probably not a revelation to parents who practically need a crowbar to get their kids off YouTube \u2013 is that online video usage is going through the roof and has more than doubled in four years. The percentage of young people who say they watch online videos \u201cevery day\u201d has gone from 24% to 56% among 8- to 12-year-olds, and from 34% to 69% among 13- to 18-year-olds.\n\nAnd the amount of time each age group spends watching online videos has gone from about a half-hour a day to about an hour a day on average.\n\nAirPods Pro: Apple announces new $249 AirPods Pro with noise cancellation\n\nIt\u2019s also no secret to parents that screen usage more broadly is already out of control. On average, the survey found, 8- to 12-year-olds are on their screens just under five hours per day. It\u2019s even worse for the teen group, who are spending an average of just under seven and a half hours daily staring at a display.\n\nMoreover, lest you think that your kids on the devices for things you approve of like doing homework think again. These screen time stats exclude them being on devices for schoolwork.\n\nCLOSE USA TODAY consumer editor Michelle Maltais and Common Sense Media executive editor Sierra Filucci share ways to manage your household\u2019s attachment to media and electronic devices. USA TODAY\n\nLess TV as a family\n\nYou may recall watching a lot of television when you were younger. And, if you're a parent, you may recall even a few years ago watching TV with your kids.\n\nBut the renaissance these days among adults watching TV does not extend to kids; the survey found that TV is losing favor among teens and tweens.\n\nOver the past four years, the percentage who say they enjoy watching TV \u201ca lot\u201d has dropped from 61% to 50% among tweens and from 45% to 33% among their older peers. And both groups watch about a half-hour less of TV shows on an actual TV today than during the period.\n\n\u201cI think there is something lost in losing even that kind of shared family experience,\u201d laments Michael Robb, the senior director of research at Common Sense, who co-authored the study.\n\nYounger kids are getting phones\n\nOne notable finding that emerged from the survey is just how young kids are getting their first smartphone. By age 11, 53% of kids have one; by 12, more than two-thirds have theirs.\n\nMaybe more revealing \u2013 and potentially disturbing \u2013 is that about 1 in 5 kids gets their first handset at just 8 years old.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s eye-opening,\u201d Robb says. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of responsibility for a little kid.\u201d\n\nIt also might cause some parental remorse.\n\n\u201cWe always recommend to parents to always have that conversation about what is expected before you give that smartphone to your kid,\u201d Robb says. That conversation should spell out the ground rules around when a phone can be used and when it cannot, typically during homework or mealtime, or in the bedroom at night. Parents should also tell the kid what the consequences are if the kids break those rules.\n\nParents talk tech: How many likes would you give raising kids in the age of social media?\n\nRobb adds that it's up to parents to model that behavior. \u201cYou have to walk the walk and talk the talk.\u201d\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/29/youtube-screen-time-overload-among-teens-and-tweens/2490553001/", "description": "A Common Sense Media survey found tweens are on screens just under five hours per day, and teens about seven and a half hours.
