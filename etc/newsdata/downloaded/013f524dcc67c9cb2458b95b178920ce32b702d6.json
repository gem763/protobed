At least, that\u2019s the claim that researchers made in a press release last week. It's the same claim that multiple news outlets dutifully parroted in startling headlines and stories about the researchers\u2019 study.\n\nThe problem is that the researchers\u2019 study does not support that claim. In fact, the question of whether six dry months before fertilization could reduce the risk of congenital heart defects wasn\u2019t addressed in the study. The researchers didn\u2019t even have the data to know if any fathers abstained from alcohol for that long prior to helping form a babby.\n\nIt seems that the now-widespread recommendation was merely the researchers\u2019 personal opinions, which were oddly included in the press release and don\u2019t appear to be based on any evidence from their study or otherwise.\n\nWhat their study did examine was whether a father\u2019s alcohol consumption within three months before fertilization\u2014or, mind-bogglingly, three months after fertilization\u2014could influence the risk of a congenital heart defect. The researchers concluded that dad\u2019s drinking in that six-month time frame did have an effect; it raised the relative risk of a congenital heart defect by 44%. The authors speculate that alcohol could cause subtle changes to DNA in sperm that could then lead to that elevated risk.\n\nBut even the conclusions that are based on data are questionable. A closer look at the researchers\u2019 analysis reveals many troubling weaknesses and caveats. For one thing, it\u2019s unclear how a father\u2019s sperm\u2014alcohol-damaged or not\u2014could have any effect on a fetus after fertilization. The researchers also skim over the fact that men in their study who drank up to about 3.5 standard alcoholic drinks a day appeared to have less risk of fathering a child with a congenital heart defect than non-drinkers. And the researchers extended their risk assessment to fathers who might be drinking up to a whopping 500 grams of alcohol a day. Given that a standard alcoholic drink in the US contains 14 grams of alcohol, that\u2019s nearly 36 drinks a day\u2014a life-threatening amount of alcohol.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the first sip of what\u2019s in this mind-bending study. Let\u2019s dive into the rest.\n\nTipsy start\n\nThe researchers have a wobbly explanation as to why they even carried out the study, which was published October 2 in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology by a team at the Central South University in Hunan, China.\n\nIn the study\u2019s introduction, the researchers first note that some earlier studies had suggested that children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) have an elevated risk of congenital heart defects (CHDs).\n\nWorldwide, CHDs are the most common type of birth defects, with many different subtypes of varying severity. In the US, about 1% of babies born each year have some form of a CHD, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cause of any given defect is often unknown.\n\nAfter bringing up a link between FASDs and CHDs, the researchers go on to note that studies looking at the possible link between maternal drinking and CHD have yielded mixed findings. But, they add, there have been three, big meta-analysis studies in recent years looking into the issue. And all three found no statistically significant link between maternal drinking and CHDs.\n\nDespite this, the authors say the question is still an open one and that no research to date has looked for a link between CHDs and alcohol use in fathers. But this is an odd set-up for the study, given that FASDs are a group of conditions defined specifically as those caused by mothers drinking during pregnancy.\n\nNevertheless, the researchers call for another round of analysis.\n\nMessy methods\n\nFor their fresh pour, the researchers conducted a fourth meta-analysis, one that included new studies that weren\u2019t in the past analyses. Generally, meta-analyses are studies that harvest and repurpose data sets from many other studies\u2014sometimes data that\u2019s been published, sometimes not\u2014using them to try to answer new questions. In this case, the researchers could sift through any studies with data on birth defects that also included data on various lifestyle factors of the babies\u2019 parents. From there, they could pull out data specifically on CHDs as well as any survey questions about parental alcohol use that just happened to be included.\n\nThe strength of these types of analyses is that they can amass data from many smaller studies into one big one, potentially firming up conclusions with larger numbers and mightier statistics. But this can also create many problems. For one thing, smashing together data from different studies can obscure any poor-quality data that\u2019s included. There\u2019s also the larger issue of publication bias\u2014a tendency to publish the studies that find links over the ones that don\u2019t. And by nature, meta-analyses can combine studies that may have disparate study designs, methods, and statistics.\n\nIn this meta-analysis, some of the harvested data only related to certain subtypes of CHDs. The included studies asked parents slightly different questions about when, how much, and how often they drank around the time of a pregnancy. The studies also have differences in how they refined their data\u2014such as trying to account for known risks of having a child with a CHD, such as a family history or certain medical conditions.\n\nStill, even if the researchers had managed to stumble passed all these problems, at best, the study can only point out a correlation between parental drinking and CHDs. It can\u2019t determine if drinking causes CHDs. Moreover, the heart of the data\u2014parental alcohol use\u2014is also based on survey responses, which can be unreliable because people may not accurately report (or admit) how much they really drink.\n\nDrunk data\n\nGiven all these limitations, the researchers boldly conclude that \u201c[w]ith an increase in parental alcohol consumption, the risk of CHDs in offspring also gradually increased. Therefore, our findings highlight the necessity of improving health awareness to prevent alcohol exposure during the preconception and conception periods.\u201d But the data is far less steady.\n\nThe researchers, led by Dr. Jiabi Qin, included data from 55 studies in their meta-analysis, amassing data on nearly 42,000 babies with CHDs. But only 24 of those studies included any data on paternal alcohol consumption, and only nine included data on fathers who reported binge drinking (defined as having five or more alcoholic drinks in one sitting).\n\nOverall, they found that mothers who reported any drinking in the three months before or three months after conception had a 16% higher risk of having a baby with a CHD than non-drinking mothers. Fathers who drank had a 44% higher risk.\n\nBut when they broke down that link to specific types of CHDs, only maternal drinking was statistically significantly linked to a higher risk of just one of the types of CHD\u2014called tetralogy of Fallot, which is a rare CHD that leads to low oxygen levels in the blood.\n\nThe authors note: \u201cour study did not find a statistically significant association between parental alcohol exposure and the remaining phenotypes of CHDs because of the limited number of included studies for specific phenotypes.\u201d\n\nWhen the researchers spilled their data into dose-response charts, the link between drinking and CHDs was even more watered down. Dose-response charts aim to look at how the dose of alcohol affects the risk of CHD. You might expect them to be in step with each other\u2014that is, the more alcohol, the more risk.\n\nBut the relationship wasn\u2019t in step. In fact, fathers who reported drinking up to 50 grams of alcohol per day (around 3.5 standard US drinks) seemed to have a lower risk of fathering a child with a CHD than non-drinkers (although this dip wasn\u2019t statistically significant). At that 50 grams per day point, the risk of CHD starts to increase. When fathers drink over 100 grams per day (around seven standard US drinks a day), they start seeing elevated risks of CHD compared with non-drinkers.\n\nThe researchers extended their dose-response curve out to fathers who might drink a shocking 500g a day, an equivalent of nearly 36 standard US drinks a day. By one calculation, a 200-pound (91kg) man who drank 36 beers (12-ounces each, 5% alcohol) over a full 24-hour period would have an estimated blood alcohol content (BAC) of about 0.45%. The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism considers any BAC over 0.31% to be life-threatening, potentially causing loss of consciousness and \u201csuppression of vital life functions.\u201d In other words, that amount of alcohol is not compatible with your own life, let alone trying to create a new one.\n\nSobering up\n\nGiven all the data, the researchers may have found a real link between paternal alcohol use and CHDs, but the finding will need to be verified and refined in yet more studies. And whether paternal alcohol use directly causes those defects will have to be explored in even more studies. For now, it\u2019s still too early to draw any clear public health recommendations from this meta-analysis (except, obviously, don\u2019t drink 500 grams of alcohol in a day).\n\nStill, that didn\u2019t seem to stop lead author Qin from overstating the findings. A stupefying press release circulated by the European Society of Cardiology notes: \u201cDr Qin said the results suggest that when couples are trying for a baby, men should not consume alcohol for at least six months before fertilization while women should stop alcohol one year before and avoid it while pregnant.\u201d", "description": "They claimed men should stop drinking for 6 months.
