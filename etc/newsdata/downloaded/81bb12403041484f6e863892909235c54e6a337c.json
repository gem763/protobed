We need to do something quite big quite soon to get ahead of the problem.'\n\nThe analysis also found the numbers of trusts reporting achieving less than 95 per cent of their planned day nurse staffing level rose from 60 hospitals in June 2014 to 93 in June 2019.\n\nFifty-two trusts also missed their nurse staffing targets for each of the 61 months since 2014.\n\nData showed on average at least 47 specialty departments were understaffed during the day each month. In total, 25 specialties were short of nurses for each of the 61 months.\n\nHSJ found the worst affected specialities were clinical pharmacology, spinal injuries, paediatric surgery, neurosurgery and neurology.\n\nThese departments were staffed with less than 90 per cent of the nurses needed each month.\n\nDr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College Emergency Medicine, told MailOnline: 'This shortage is in part the reason why so many trusts are struggling to maintain patient flow in hospitals, discharge patients in a timely fashion and prevent long waits.\n\nThe total number of trained nurses on day shifts compared to the growing number of healthcare assistants. It suggests hospitals are compensating for a lack of nurses by hiring more care workers\n\n'The level of care provided by our nursing workforce is exemplary and the shortage of around 43,000 nurses is undoubtedly having an effect on patient experience.\n\n'The shortage means that nurses working in crowded Emergency Departments are being stretched to their limits.\n\n'The forthcoming NHS People Plan must provide a clear framework of how we fill the 100,000 vacancies there currently are, but also address why people are leaving \u2013 retaining the staff we do have is crucial, particularly going into what will be a difficult winter.'\n\nNorth Tees and Hartlepool Foundation Trust reported fewer than 90 per cent of nurses every month since 2014.\n\nThe Princess Alexandra Hospital had fewer than 80 per cent for 34 consecutive months.\n\nA spokesman for North Tees told HSJ: 'Over the past 18 months, the trust has been particularly successful in recruiting into vacant posts and maintaining a low vacancy rate.\n\n'Gaps in fill rates are due to a number of factors including staff sickness absence and not purely related to vacancies.'\n\nAn NHS England spokesperson admitted there needed to be a further large increase in the nursing workforce over the next five years.\n\nThey said this will be addressed in the forthcoming NHS People Plan, which sets out how the NHS will grow its workforce and improve staffing.", "description": "NHS trusts in England which had 10 per cent or fewer nurses on their day shifts than they needed each month increased from 20 in June 2014 to\u00a055 in June 2019.", "authors": ["Connor Boyd Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20133394-0-image-a-6_1571924357916.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
