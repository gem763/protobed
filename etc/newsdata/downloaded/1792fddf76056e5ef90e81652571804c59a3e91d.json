Day's management team has said the 27-year-old fighter suffered a traumatic brain injury during his USBA super welterweight title fight against Conwell.\n\n\"If I could take it all back I would. No one deserves for this to happen to them,\" Conwell wrote in the post. \"I prayed for you so many times and shedded so many tears because I couldn't even imagine how my family and friends would feel.\n\n\"I see you everywhere I go and all I hear is wonderful things about you. I thought about quitting boxing but I know that's not what you would want. I know that you were a fighter at heart so I decided not to but to fight and win a world title because that's what you wanted.\"\n\nCharles Conwell (black trunks) and Patrick Day (red trunks) box during a USBA Super-Welterweight boxing match at Wintrust Arena.

I'm trying to make him realize it's no fault of his,\" DiBella told the outlet. \"I read what he wrote and it put a tear in my eye. It was an incredibly human and honest and genuine response from a kid who is just 21.\"\n\nDay's status remains unclear. His management team said in a statement over the weekend that Day was in a coma as of Sunday evening, adding that \"updates will be provided as circumstances change.\"\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "description": "Boxer Charles Conway wrote an emotional open letter to Patrick Day, who is in extremely critical condition after Conway knocked him out in fight.", "authors": ["Tom Schad", "Published A.M.
