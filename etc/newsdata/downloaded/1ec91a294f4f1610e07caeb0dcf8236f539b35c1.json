It was horrendous. The vicar started conducting a marriage ceremony by accident, and one of the coffin bearers sang hymns half a line behind the rest of the congregation. It always bothered me. I wanted to help people, so I decided to train at a national funeral directors. While I was there, I came across an advert to hire a motorcycle hearse. I asked the owner for a job and ended up spending the next four years working as the world\u2019s first full-time female motorcycle hearse rider.\n\nWorking in the industry opened my eyes to how funeral directors worked \u2013 good and bad. In the end, I thought I couldn\u2019t complain about others if I wasn\u2019t prepared to put my money where my mouth was. So I set up my own company. We\u2019re not about selling things, it\u2019s not about turnover or profit \u2013 it\u2019s about people. We don\u2019t wear suits in the office and my two dogs come into work with me. We\u2019re focused on helping people relax. Recently a client mentioned that her brother would DJ in a pub in Oxford where he\u2019d have to take his equipment by boat. It was a little throwaway comment, but we ended up taking him to his funeral in the pub by the same boat down the Thames. I also had the absolute privilege to take my friend and mentor, the owner of Motorcycle Funerals, on a 126mph final ride around Donington Park circuit as part of his funeral. I know he would have loved that.\n\nI take a salary of between \u00a316,000 and \u00a326,000 from the business. I take out as little as possible so I can keep prices the same. I haven\u2019t increased my prices since the day we opened six years ago, and I don\u2019t envisage doing it.\n\n\u2018I swapped a job in Cumbria for blogging from the beach in Bali\u2019 Read more\n\nAs for my household finances, I don\u2019t have a clue \u2013 my wife Nonie takes care of all that. I put \u00a31,000 a month into our bank account and that covers everything for my part: household bills, food, rent and so on. She has a spreadsheet and works everything out. I just know what I need to put in. I\u2019m really lucky that my wife has a great job. Between us we spend at least \u00a3400 a month on our two dogs, which pays for their vet bills, insurance, organic dog food and treats.\n\nWhatever is left covers my Bupa and motorcycle insurance. If I want to buy something frivolous, I\u2019ll email my accountant and ask if I can take it out. Two years after opening, I took out \u00a3650 to buy a first edition of Patricia Cornwell\u2019s Postmortem. That had been a dream of mine since I was 13.\n\nI own three motorcycles: a Honda Fireblade, which is worth nothing but is of sentimental value, a Yamaha WR450 and a Triumph Speed Triple.\n\nI sometimes spend more than \u00a3100 a month on books. I read a lot of crime fiction, biographies and general fiction.\n\n\u2018I quit a career in teaching to work for an animal sanctuary\u2019 Read more\n\nI\u2019ve always loved the artform of tattooing. I\u2019m 70% covered in tattoos \u2013 I\u2019ve only got my two thighs, hands and neck left. I spend anywhere between \u00a31,000 to \u00a33,000 a year on tattoos. In the last few years I\u2019ve travelled to the Netherlands and Germany for appointments with tattooists because I love their style.\n\nI rarely take holidays. When we got married we visited Scotland and spent a stupid amount on a holiday as we hadn\u2019t been away for seven years. But generally I don\u2019t take holidays.\n\nWe have five-year and 10-year plans that involve buying a house and travelling. I have the big ideas and then Nonie makes it into a spreadsheet and works out how we\u2019ll get there.\n\nThe plan is to move to Devon. I\u2019ll work in Oxford four days a week and she\u2019ll work from home. I did consider opening further offices, but then I had a massive epiphany and realised that actually I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m happy with what we do. I can manage it now and if I try to expand and make it bigger, a lot will be lost and, to be honest, it\u2019s just unadulterated vanity. And I\u2019m not particularly vain. I love meeting incredibly random people and, for me, that\u2019s worth more than money.", "description": "Lucy Coulbert, 37, on her finances \u2013 and how boats and motorbikes have played a role in her services", "authors": ["Suzanne Bearne"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/970909fcf8e209035ac3ce75269a848a924a1492/0_4_3597_2158/master/3597.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6f15cb86d7352c402cfc5eb420e2b2e8", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
