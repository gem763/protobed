We have to face up to it.\u201d\n\nScotland have bounced back from a 27-3 drubbing by Ireland in their opening game to smash Samoa 34-0 and Russia 61-0.\n\nBut a Japanese side that left Ireland seeing stars brings a different set of challenges.\n\n\u201cWe know it wouldn\u2019t be an embarrassment to lose to Japan,\u201d said Townsend, striking a more conciliatory tone.\n\n\u201cWe know they are an excellent side and we will have to play very well to win.\u201d", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 An angry war of words between Japan and Scotland has injected an element of needle into Sunday\u2019s typhoon-threatened Rugby World", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/06c6a4_japan-coach-jamie-joseph-was-unimpressed-by-scotland-talk-legal-threats-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
