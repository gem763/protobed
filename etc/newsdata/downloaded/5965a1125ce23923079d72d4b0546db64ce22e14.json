You're absolutely huge'.\n\n(Image: Ric Mellis/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\n(Image: Ric Mellis/Hyde News & Pictures Ltd)\n\n\"I had already said we were not going to have sex. You end up getting to know someone over a cup of tea and I invited him in to be sociable.\n\n\"I thought he was going to have a cup of tea and chat.\"\n\nLater in the trial, Mr Schubert took to the witness box to profess his innocence.\n\nHe said the woman \"enjoyed\" the intimacy and showed no signs she was not consenting.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/Press Association Images)\n\nAfter the verdicts were given Mr Schubert, of Orchard Close in Hail Weston, Cambridgeshire, broke down in tears and sobbed loudly.\n\nJudge Nigel Daly told jurors: \"As you can see trials with allegations such as these are very emotional affairs.\n\n\"It is something which is very difficult to do, we greatly appreciate you have come to this court as members of the public to try other members of the public.\n\n\"If you didn't do that then the criminal justice system simply could not continue.\"", "description": "Christopher Schubert from Hail Weston, in Cambridgeshire, was cleared of the charges in Oxford Crown Court today", "authors": ["Neil Hyde", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Ric Mellis Hyde News", "Pictures Ltd", "Pa Archive Press Association Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20578643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Woman-said-dating-site-rape-accused-fatter-than-his-pictures.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
