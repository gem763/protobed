I should know': SUSANNA REID reveals the secret to her TV looks", "language": "en", "text": "At 7 o\u2019clock on a Saturday evening, I am trying to follow a complex YouTube tutorial on how to create a \u2018smokey eye\u2019. It\u2019s my ideal look for a night out, but I am completely clueless as to how to create it myself.\n\nFrom Monday to Thursday, I have the Good Morning Britain glam squad at work making me look my best (see the before and after pictures, below). Amy blow-dries the frizz from my hair, while Heather or Mel work on my face. They breeze into my dressing room, rolling suitcases of lotions and potions, ready to mask my blemishes and lines while I read the newspapers and briefing notes.\n\nAt home at the weekend, I am cast adrift, and my feeble attempts at a smokey eye quickly turn into a decidedly unglamourous \u2018black eye\u2019 before I get out the make-up remover. I turn to my trusty Bare Essentials tinted moisturiser and Lancome mascara, and head out the door.\n\nSusanna Reid, 48, writes in her second sparkling column for Femail that it is okay for women to look red carpet ready as long as they feel good inside\n\nThe working mother has also revealed the secret to her stunning looks on television - a really talented team! (Left) how she looks arriving for work at 4am, and (right) ready at 6am\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t want to go on air without my \u2018armour\u2019 on: make-up gives me a mask to help me do my job. I also have a weekly spray tan and dye my roots fortnightly.\n\nIt\u2019s a case of faking it to make it, and I\u2019m OK with that. I\u2019m all for making ourselves look good \u2014 as long as we feel good, too. Feeling under pressure to look the same means we\u2019ve gone too far.\n\nI have found my mood drop on occasion, scrolling through everyone\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m having my best life\u2019 Instagram looks. It\u2019s one of the reasons I post bareface selfies on social media because, sometimes, the \u2018amazing\u2019 pictures give the wrong impression.\n\nOr consider the scene at the National Reality TV Awards this week. I rarely go out late, given my 4am start for work, but GMB had a clutch of nominations. Forget the red carpet, it should have been called the orange carpet, with the plump-lipped, bronzed cast of Love Island jostling with the team from Geordie Shore. The goody bag was 95 per cent fake tan products.\n\nI\u2019d come straight from cooking my boys steak pie and veg for tea and couldn\u2019t have felt less glam. Luckily, a sequinned dress works wonders \u2014 in fact, there appeared to be an unofficial dress code. The amount of flesh on show! Acres and acres of it.\n\nSusanna Reid, 48, (pictured) who is a new Femail columnist, revealed last week why she's stopped trying to be perfect and advises her family to embrace just being good enough\n\nSusanna also said that she turned up for the National Reality TV awards after cooking her boys steak pie and vegetables for the evening. (Susanna on Good Morning Britain on October 2)\n\n\u2018Fake\u2019 used to be an insult, but now it\u2019s a badge of honour, with hair extensions, tans and nails all artificial, but looking fabulous. No, I couldn\u2019t pick half of these young stars out of a line-up, but they entertain millions every week \u2014 and I share their love of a fake eyelash.\n\nThis week's guilty click... When the alarm clock is set to a time you\u2019d usually only get up at to catch a plane, anything that encourages sleep is worth investing in. When I spray and sniff Ren\u2019s & Now To Sleep Pillow Spray (\u00a318, renskincare.com), I feel drowsy. It might be a trick of the mind, but the smell of frankincense and lavender is divinely dreamy. Sleep Pillow Spray, \u00a318, is this week's\n\nGMB had a good night, winning Best Talk Show, while I was thrilled to win Celebrity Personality of the Year and Best TV Presenter. I sipped sparkling water all evening and didn\u2019t stay late \u2014 those reality stars know how to party.\n\nAs I left, the cast of The Only Way Is Essex shouted after me: \u2018Give him hell tomorrow!\u2019, referring to our own Rottweiler, Piers Morgan. For a man who professes to love winners and hate losers, he seemed oddly grumpy the next morning about my clutch of three awards!\n\nI do think the glitz of reality stars and social media is changing our society. At 20, I barely wore make-up and rarely visited a hairdresser. My graduation photo shows bushy brows and a blotchy complexion that make me cringe when I see it in Mum\u2019s living room.\n\nBut, when I went back to Cardiff University recently, every graduate accepting their certificate had their \u2018face on\u2019 and a blow-dry.\n\nEven men are taking far more care of their looks. Just look at the photos of Simon Cowell, 59, on holiday in Mexico. He\u2019s ditched the \u2018dad bod\u2019, lost 20lb on his vegan diet and switched cola for green juice. His skin looks smooth and his teeth are gleaming.\n\nThere\u2019s speculation he\u2019s had some \u2018help\u2019 \u2014 and, if he has, it\u2019s made him look great.\n\nAs for older women, they blow me away. On the GMB sofa, gravel-voiced Bonnie Tyler revealed her smooth skin at 68 is down to \u2018Botox twice a year\u2019.\n\nThe TV presenter also revealed that that she thought \u2018fake\u2019 used to be an insult, but now it\u2019s a badge of honour, with hair extensions, tans and nails all artificial, but looking fabulous\n\nActress Hayley Mills, 73, has a natural, softly lined face and wildly stylish silver-blonde hair. How does she look so fabulous?\n\nOFF-AIR GOSSIP When I asked Darcey Bussell about the new series of Strictly, she insisted she\u2019s too busy to watch since quitting as a judge. I know the feeling. When you leave, it\u2019s like a fab party going on without you. But she\u2019ll find it hard to shimmy away from the Strictly questions for a long while yet.\n\n\u2018Not getting up at sparrow\u2019s-fart every morning,\u2019 she claimed, which doesn\u2019t bode well for my hopes of looking that good in 20 years!\n\nAnd Trisha Goddard looks so youthful I couldn\u2019t believe she turns 62 in December. \u2018What\u2019s your secret?\u2019 I gasped. \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she mused, before adding: \u2018Actually, my secret is chemotherapy. I\u2019m alive.\u2019\n\nShe beat breast cancer back in 2008. She looks incredible, has a renewed zest for life and is pushing out of her comfort zone by going on TV\u2019s Dancing On Ice.\n\nNow there\u2019s a healthy perspective for you. There\u2019s nothing fake about that.\n\nsusannareid@dailymail.co.uk\n\nWHAT I THINK OF THE BBC RACE ROW\n\nI\u2019m a proud ex-BBC employee, but its flip-flop over presenter Naga Munchetty \u2014 first censured for sharing her experience of racism, then absolved when the decision caused uproar \u2014 doesn\u2019t look good.\n\nAll its stars must be confused. What exactly can they say? At ITV, we\u2019re bound by the same broadcasting impartiality rules. I would never want anyone to be able to tell which way I vote, but we\u2019re encouraged to share our opinions and experiences \u2014 and viewers love it.\n\nThat\u2019s especially important when, like Naga (pictured), a presenter has a personal story that\u2019s truly relevant to the news. Otherwise, what are we there for?", "description": "Susanna Reid, 48, says in her second sparkling column for Femail that it's okay for women to look glamorous, as long as they feel good on the inside.
