The insurer, whose case was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, provided new details on the theft to The Washington Post on Wednesday, including an email from the employee tricked by what the insurer is referring to internally as \u201cthe false Johannes.\u201d\n\nNow being developed by a wide range of Silicon Valley titans and AI start-ups, such voice-synthesis software can copy the rhythms and intonations of a person\u2019s voice and be used to produce convincing speech. Tech giants such as Google and smaller firms such as the \u201cultrarealistic voice cloning\u201d start-up Lyrebird have helped refine the resulting fakes and made the tools more widely available for free and unlimited use.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Technology An-Artificial-Intelligence-First-Voice-Mimicking-Software-Reportedly-Used-Major-Theft"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
