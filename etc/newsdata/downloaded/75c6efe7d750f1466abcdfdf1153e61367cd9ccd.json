However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nWhen the weather is crisp and the clouds are overcast, it's the perfect time to huddle under the covers in bed, or as I like to call it, my hedonistic sloth nest. All you need is a candle burning on your nightstand, Netflix on in the background, oh, and of course a comfy duvet and plush mattress to help make it all the more cozy. If your current mattress leaves a lot to be desired, we have some good news for you. In honor of Columbus Day, Casper is offering shoppers a discount on their cult-favorite mattresses.\n\nFrom today until October 14, you can take 10% off any order on Casper that includes a mattress with the code DREAMY10. Casper is one of the biggest players in the mattress-in-a-box game, and has transformed how millions of customers shop for their sleep. Even my boss, Dave Kender, claims that his Casper mattress is an absolute game-changer to catch those elusive ZZZ's.\n\nWith this sale, you can get discounts on all three models of Casper's mattresses: the Essential, the Original, and the Wave (listed in order of price). The Essential is the most basic with three layers of foam, while the Original has four and the Wave an impressive five layers of cloud-like memory foam. These mattresses are made with an open-cell foam for ultimate breathability and are designed with what Casper calls \"Zoned Support\" that relieves pressure points, aligns your body, and minimizes tossing and turning by absorbing your weight.\n\nEach Casper mattress also comes with a 10-year limited warranty, a 100-night trial period, and free shipping and returns. But chances are you'll love how it strikes the perfect balance between firm and soft, and become even more addicted to your bed. Plus, with this discount, you can say goodbye to restless nights without shelling out the big bucks.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
