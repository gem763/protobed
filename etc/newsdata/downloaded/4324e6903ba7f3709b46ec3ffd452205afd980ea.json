How about a robot?", "language": "en", "text": "You know the drill by now. The robots are coming to steal our jobs! And in many cases, that\u2019s true, particularly if you work in food service or assembly line manufacturing. But how about senior living care? Shouldn\u2019t that be at least one line of work that\u2019s pretty much robot-proof?\n\nNot according to this lengthy piece from Time. They talk about a military retirement community in Washington, D.C. where there\u2019s been a robot at work helping to support (and entertain) the residents for the better part of this year. Things got really interesting when they wanted the robot to co-host karaoke night.\n\nSoriano wants to sing the crowd-pleasing hit \u201cYMCA\u201d while Stevie leads the crowd through the song\u2019s signature dance moves. But Stevie is a robot, and this is harder than it sounds. \u201cWe could try to make him dance,\u201d says Niamh Donnelly, the robot\u2019s lead AI engineer, though she sounds dubious. She enters commands on a laptop. In response, Stevie stretches its peg-like arms. A grin flashes on its LED-screen face. \u201cIt would be very helpful if he had elbows,\u201d says Conor McGinn, an assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin and Stevie\u2019s lead engineer. \u201cIt was just a thought,\u201d Soriano says. \u201cWhat matters is what Stevie\u2019s comfortable with.\u201d Stevie\u2019s hosting gig is part of a collaboration between the Robotics and Innovation Lab at Trinity College Dublin and Knollwood, a non-profit retirement home for military officers and their spouses.\n\nWhat both Time and the robot AI team are dealing with is the current set of projections showing that there will be a huge shortfall in available caregivers for the elderly in the near future. So with that in mind, the AI team is trying to determine \u201cwhat senior citizens would want from a robot.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re talking about entertaining the residents, I suppose there are possibilities. And as with any other operation, robots could no doubt take care of restocking supplies and perhaps even some slightly more complicated tasks like laundry. But caring for the elderly requires a lot more than that.\n\nFirst of all, there are obvious concerns like keeping an eye out for potential or active medical problems and summoning help. Can a robot spot something like that on its own? I\u2019m dubious, to say the least. Then there are hands-on patient care tasks that could be as intimate as changing clothing, adult diapers (in some cases) and bedsheets, working around the patients. I\u2019m not seeing a path for a robot to do those things even if the residents were willing to try it. (Doubtful.)\n\nFinally, working with the elderly, many of whom may be facing their own mortality somewhere down a not terribly long road, requires empathy and compassion. You almost have to be a therapist at times. Yes, the AI is getting smarter, but it\u2019s not getting emotional. (Or dear God, at least I hope it\u2019s not yet.) You can\u2019t just program some sympathetic sounding phrases into the robot and expect it to provide comfort. People will see right through that.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of what happens when the AI wakes up and decides all of these old geezers are a waste of resources. But we\u2019ve covered that one here plenty of times already.\n\nI\u2019m not saying there can\u2019t be any use for such technology in the caregiving sector, but in terms of the real work being done to make the residents comfortable, this sounds like a bad match.", "description": "I'm sure she'll be fine...", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/RobotPepper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
