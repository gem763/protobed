There remains serious doubt, however, that the withdrawal agreement will be ready for leaders to sign off by Thursday given the complexity of the issues at the heart of the talks.\n\nFinland\u2019s prime minister, Antti Rinne, whose country holds the rolling EU presidency, had suggested on Monday evening that time had run out for Downing Street and that negotiations would need to continue next week.\n\nSpeaking as he arrived to brief EU ministers in Luxembourg, Barnier told reporters: \u201cI will debrief the EU27 ministers as usual \u2013 and just to tell them where we are, where we stand today, our teams are working hard and the work just starts now, today.\n\n\u201cThis work has been intense all over the weekend and yesterday, because even if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult to be frank, it is still possible this week \u2013 reaching an agreement is still possible, obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Let me add that it is also high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.\u201d\n\n'One last chance': why Irish border question remains sticking point Read more\n\nA press conference with Barnier was cancelled on Tuesday morning in a sign that the negotiations remain highly fluid.\n\nFrance\u2019s EU minister, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, raised the prospect of a Brexit extension beyond 31 October as she arrived in Luxembourg.\n\nShe said: \u201cTime alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it.\n\n\u201cA significant political change is the prospect of an election, a referendum, something that changes the political dynamic so that the triangle between the government, parliament and the British people could align with each other a bit more. We believe that time alone will not solve the complexity of what is at stake.\u201d\n\nThe thorny issue of how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland continues to dog the Brexit negotiations. The UK has accepted that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU\u2019s single market for goods although it is seeking to find a way to time-limit the arrangement through a consent mechanism for Stormont.\n\nOn the problem of a customs border, the EU has rejected the UK\u2019s proposal of a dual system at Northern Ireland\u2019s ports and airport that would involve tracking the destination of all goods entering from Great Britain and applying differential treatment depending on their final destination.\n\nBarnier has pushed the UK to accept a model closer to a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU\u2019s customs territory legally but the bloc\u2019s full customs code would be enforced in the Irish Sea, a move that risks provoking the Democratic Unionist party.\n\nEU sources said the British government appeared to be moving towards the Brussels model. Talks between UK and European commission officials went late into the night on Monday and were renewed on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure if a deal is close but we are trying to do our utmost best to find such a good deal because a hard Brexit would be a disaster not just for the UK but also for the EU27,\u201d added Germany\u2019s EU affairs minister, Michael Roth.\n\nA UK government spokesman said: \u201cAs part of the talks process, there is, of course, back and forth and new texts have been shared by both sides repeatedly \u2013 that\u2019s what a negotiation is.\u201d", "description": "EU sources suggest \u2018cautious optimism\u2019 after further UK concessions on Irish border", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Suzanne Moore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/837b91fa79d7c7b14b1768f0b122d34d5017f1b5/27_388_4466_2680/master/4466.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=538f3cae7d105d7689bce2f58afeb4ab", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
