The demands include the following: fully withdraw from a proposed bill that would allow Hong Kong people to be extradited to mainland China\n\nretract any characterization of the movement as a \u201criot\u201d\n\ndrop all charges against anti-extradition protesters\n\nset up an independent committee to investigate the use of force by Hong Kong police\n\nuniversal suffrage in elections for the city\u2019s chief executive officer and legislature by 2020. (CNBC)\n\nDuring a brief television address, Lam said, \u201cthe government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom this month, I and my principal officials will reach out to the community to start a direct dialogue,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople from all walks of life, with different views and backgrounds are invited to share their views and air their grievances.\u201d\n\nBut Lam said in a pre-recorded television message on Wednesday that the government would not accept other demands, including an independent inquiry into alleged police misconduct against protesters. However, she named two new members to a police watchdog agency investigating the matter. Protesters have also called for the release of those detained without charges, but Lam said this was unacceptable. (WaPo)\n\nAccording to The New York Times, protesters continued calls on the online forum LIHKG to not compromise until all five demands were met.", "description": ".10/02/2019 12:24:39PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/283/b573948e-5fd4-494a-9d00-927b12ebeadd.jpg"}
