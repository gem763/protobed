Located in Beijing, the warehousing facility features a new monitoring system that can detect and assess problems that occur on-site, in real-time.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce giant said 5G provided the bandwidth to increase the efficiency of its IIoT capabilities \"on a large scale\" and facilitate \"instantaneous communication\" between its staff and machines. With its real-time monitoring system, it would be able to track the location and routes of forklifts and pallets as well as receive preemptive alerts if there was an anomaly.\n\nFor instance, to ensure efficiency and safety, the system could detect forklifts that had been parked in the wrong locations or taken abnormal driving route. Automated mass pallet monitoring also significantly improved efficiencies compared to manual monitoring, said JD.com's logistics arm.\n\nJD Logistics said: \"The 5G system will also greatly improve the efficiency of operations within the facility through smart parking that guides incoming vehicles to the most appropriate parking space or docking bay, and digital docking bay that can [facilitate] real-time monitoring the truck loading and uploading goods.\n\nThese, it added, were amongst the company's plans to tap 5G technologies, with 5G-powered IIoT fuelling further applications for JD.com's logistics operations and improving efficiency across its supply chain. It said these technologies would be used throughout its network of logistics parks to enable \"reliable and dependable\" robot-to-robot communications, hence, reducing the need for human intervention.\n\nJD Logistics' chief architect of logistics R&D and head of the logistics park, Zhe Wenming, said: \"The low latency, high speed, and ability to support a broad spectrum of simultaneous connections provided by 5G networks creates an unprecedented level of real-time connectivity, significantly improving the efficiency of JD's fulfilment operations, which is key to providing the best customer service in the business.\"\n\nJD.com last October launched a parcel delivery service in China, which it said enabled consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to send packages inter-city and across mainland China via its mobile app. It planned to expand service options to include various delivery timing, including same-day or two-day delivery, and high-value items such as luxury products and high-end consumer electronics.\n\nAccording to JD.com, the new parcel delivery service would operate on the company's existing logistics network and supply chain management technology, which pledged to deliver more than 90% of orders either within the day or the following day.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nJD.com expands logistics services to include parcel delivery\n\nChinese e-commerce giant taps its existing network to introduce parcel delivery service across China, enabling consumers to send packages using its mobile app.\n\nJD.com enters food production business with hydroponic plant\n\nChinese e-commerce giant has entered the food production business with a 11,040 square metre hydroponic plant in China, built in partnership with Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical.\n\nChina to lead APAC tech spend, 5G race ahead of global markets\n\nChina will remain Asia's largest in terms of tech spending, growing 4 percent this year and 6 percent in 2020, and lead global markets in the 5G race where its investments in telecommunications account for 57 percent of the country's overall spend.\n\nAlibaba wants to build logistics network that can handle 1 billion packages a day\n\nChinese e-commerce giant says its 100 billion yuan (US$15.58 billion) investment aims to drive down logistics costs and bolster capacity from its current 100 million packages a day.\n\n'Smart logistics' to feature in Singapore's upcoming ICT masterplan\n\nWith the country's next ICT blueprint to be announced later this year, the Singapore government reiterates its smart nation push at this year's imbX show and unveils efforts to make data intelligence more accessible to the logistics industry.", "description": "Located in Beijing, the Chinese e-commerce giant says its 5G-powered logistics park will enhance site operations such as real-time monitoring of routes for forklifts and sending out alerts when there is an anomaly.", "authors": ["Eileen Yu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/05/31/b1cdc5fe-fbc3-4f55-8380-6d9c9e5d8815/thumbnail/770x578/fc1e9cf58a75b334b8c7116a584e543d/smart-logistics.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
