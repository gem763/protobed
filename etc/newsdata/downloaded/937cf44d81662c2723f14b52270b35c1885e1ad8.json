It\u2019s plagued by spam notifications, tied down with aggressive battery management settings, and puts its face recognition software front and center despite that feature clearly not being ready for prime time. The first time you use it, its \u00a3199 (\u20ac229, around $253) price point feels appropriate.\n\nHowever, spend a little time Googling the issues you encounter, tweaking settings, and customizing the experience, and you\u2019ll be left with a device that feels like it\u2019s worth a lot more. It\u2019s a great showcase for the customizability of Android, but those are steps that you shouldn\u2019t have to take in the first place.\n\nOur review of Honor 10 Lite Verge Score 7.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Minimal notch\n\nBig colorful screen\n\nThat headphone jack Bad Stuff Shoddy Bluetooth performance\n\nAggressive battery-saving options\n\nMicro USB\n\nThe default settings almost feel as though Huawei has underestimated what its own hardware is capable of. Either that, or it\u2019s simply overestimated how important battery life is to people compared to having a screen that doesn\u2019t dim after just ten seconds or being able to rely on apps running in the background.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the hardware, because it\u2019s what every budget phone\u2019s compromises stem from. Fundamentally, the internals of the Honor 10 Lite are very similar to last year\u2019s \u00a3220 (about $280) Honor 8X, albeit with lower spec options available if you stick closer to the starting price. This means that while all the handsets have the same Kirin 710 chipset, you have the option of dropping down to 3GB of RAM or 32GB of storage. However, if you want the same specs as the 8X, then 4GB or 6GB of RAM is available along with a maximum of 64GB of storage. Compared to the 8X, the battery capacity has shrunk from 3750mAh down to 3400mAh.\n\nBefore you get to the internals of the phone, the first thing you\u2019re likely to notice is the 6.21-inch display. The Honor 10 Lite features the same tiny notch as the 8X Max which, unlike its little brother (the 8X), never saw a Western release. The resolution is still 2340 x 1080, but the smaller notch means you can make much more use of the 19.5:9 aspect ratio. It\u2019s a big, bright IPS LCD screen, and I never found myself wanting for the sharpness of a higher-resolution screen \u2014 although a smaller display chin would have been nice.\n\nI was less enamored with the overall build quality of the phone. The plastic construction isn\u2019t surprising at this price point, but the two-tone light blue color scheme of our device felt a little garish. Other color options include a darker blue model, red, and black.\n\nBut once you get beyond its screen, the Honor 10 Lite actually makes a pretty bad first impression. Notifications nagged me to clone an old Huawei device that I no longer have access to, the face unlock system worked so infrequently that eventually I disabled it, and the default screen timeout time was so short that I could barely read a screen\u2019s worth of text without it dimming on me.\n\nMost annoying of all was Huawei\u2019s aggressive battery-saving options, which are intended to stop apps from consuming too much power in the background. In theory, this means less waste and better battery life, but in practice it was just a little annoying. I\u2019d search for a route in Google Maps, only to find my route had been wiped after responding to a couple of WhatsApp messages. I\u2019d lose tweets mid-sentence when I exited the app to grab a URL. Most annoying of all, I once had an app reset in the middle of logging in because I switched apps to grab a 2FA code from my authenticator app.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s essential to note at this point is that you can fix all of these annoyances within the settings. You can extend the amount of time it takes for a screen to dim, and you can disable notifications from Huawei\u2019s apps. You can turn off face unlock and rely entirely on the proficient rear-mounted fingerprint sensor, and you can stop the phone\u2019s software from aggressively shutting down background processes. You\u2019ll sacrifice a little battery life, but I was still happily putting the phone on its charger with around 20 percent of capacity left each evening, even after I made these changes.\n\nWhile the Honor 10 Lite isn\u2019t running anything close to stock Android thanks to Huawei\u2019s EMUI 9.0 skin, you still have plenty of customizability options to play with to move it closer to the experience that you want. Underneath its skin is the latest version of Google\u2019s OS, Android Pie.\n\nUnfortunately, the Honor 10 Lite has other annoyances that are less easy to fix. Its wireless Bluetooth performance, for one, is shockingly bad. I experienced frequent dropouts when using my Bowers & Wilkins PX wireless headphones, even when walking through slightly busy areas, and it was so bad that I had to rewind a couple of podcasts to pick up on details that I missed. An included headphone jack positioned alongside the outdated Micro USB port means you aren\u2019t forced to go wireless, but it\u2019s pretty frustrating nonetheless.\n\nContinuing with the audio complaints, the Honor 10 Lite\u2019s built-in speakers are also pretty basic. Yes, they\u2019re able to get plenty loud enough if you want to push the volume, but doing so distorts the sound so much that I occasionally found myself lowering the volume to make things easier to hear.\n\nThe modest Kirin 710 processor can also mean that the phone occasionally lags when switching between apps. Sometimes I had to wait seconds for the keyboard to appear when I wanted to compose a WhatsApp message, and Facebook Messenger\u2019s augmented reality filters stuttered a lot while I tried to use them. It was nothing that made these services unusable, but moments like these reminded me I was using a \u00a3199 device.\n\nThe final feature that you\u2019re unlikely to be able to fix by changing the phone\u2019s settings is its camera. The Honor 10 Lite has a dual camera setup on its rear with a 13-megapixel, f/1.8 camera (flanked by a second 2-megapixel one) which really struggles to offer much in the way of detail or dynamic range. Photos can also occasionally suffer from excessive processing that makes their colors look overly saturated.\n\nGrid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Honor 10 Lite also has a couple of different photography modes that you can manually switch between depending on the situation. Unfortunately, these remain constrained by the same hardware limitations as the main camera. A night mode does an okay job at combining multiple exposures to restore detail, but the portrait modes are a single-use gimmick.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t buy a \u00a3199 phone and not expect there to be tradeoffs, but Honor\u2019s software settings make the Honor 10 Lite\u2019s issues seem far more severe at first glance. However, once you\u2019ve spent a little time digging around in the settings and getting it set up the way you want it, then there\u2019s really a lot to like here. The screen is big and bright, and the processor is fast enough to handle most of what you\u2019ll throw at it on a daily basis.\n\nFundamental hardware limitations mean there are some aspects of the device that you\u2019ll never truly be able to fix. There\u2019s no setting that magically fixes the camera, no toggle to make your wireless headphones work when you\u2019re walking through a crowd, and no third-party USB-C port you can install yourself.\n\nBut if these are tradeoffs that you\u2019re willing to make, then the Honor 10 Lite is a decent budget buy. The phone is available now across Europe, with prices starting at \u20ac229 or \u00a3199.99 for the 3GB model with 64GB of built-in storage.", "description": "Although it makes a bad first impression, there\u2019s a lot to like about Honor\u2019s latest budget smartphone.
