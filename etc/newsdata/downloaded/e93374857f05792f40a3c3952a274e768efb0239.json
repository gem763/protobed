I\u2019ve used the range for years, and it\u2019s still got pride of place in my home \u2014 but I also think it\u2019s one of Apple\u2019s disappointing products.\n\nAnd that makes me sad.\n\nThe recent tvOS 13 update has been a long-awaited push in the right direction for the hardware, yet for this current iteration of the device, I have a feeling it\u2019s too little, too late.\n\nOh no, you\u2019re going to get all David Copperfield aren\u2019t you?\n\nDamn straight.\n\nNow, the first Apple TV I used (which I believe was a second generation device) felt ahead of its time. I remember being in awe of how you could just send a video straight from your iPhone or iPad to the television. Honestly, my friends and I spent hours playing YouTube videos through the big screen. It was magical.\n\nYes, the actual Apple TV looks pretty much the same, but the remote has changed. Ahh, the memories of always losing that little silver controller.\n\nUnfortunately, things have been on a downward trend since then.\n\nAside from a few small additions (better hardware, new remote, Siri-integration, a 4k model), the Apple TV hasn\u2019t added any features as powerful or interesting as those early days of casting video.\n\nHell, I wouldn\u2019t even say the Apple TV is even the best at that any longer. These days, the substantially cheaper Chromecast ($35 compared to the Apple TV HD\u2019s $149) is far more efficient at sending phone video to your TV.\n\nIn terms of functionality, the purpose of the Apple TV became\u2026 muddy. Yes, it works well as media streamer, but you can get way cheaper Android media boxes for that price (like the $70 Roku stick for example). It didn\u2019t really have any features that truly separated it from the market.\n\nIn other words, it felt like Apple had a great, ahead-of-its-time thing going, but just kinda ignored the hardware until it lost its competitive advantage.\n\nI feel there\u2019s a tvOS 13-related \u2018but\u2019 coming here\u2026\n\nWell, tvOS 13 has included some of the first interesting updates of the Apple TV since\u2026 well, ever. Now, I assume this increased focus on the device is down to the launch of the confusingly named Apple TV+, also known as the company\u2019s streaming service.\n\nWith this set to be a big focus for the tech giant, it makes sense that\u2019d it turn some attention to one of the primary ways to view the upcoming shows and movies: its video-playing hardware.\n\nRight. So what are the tvOS 13 updates then?\n\nLet\u2019s use the ever-dependable bullet point list to help us get this done quickly:\n\nMulti-user support: you know how Netflix has users so you can watch your own shit? The Apple TV has that now too\n\nyou know how Netflix has users so you can watch your own shit? The Apple TV has that now too Apple Arcade: yep, you can now play a huge library of games on the hardware\n\nyep, you can now play a huge library of games on the hardware You can connect Xbox and Playstation controllers to the Apple TV now: not bad, right?\n\nnot bad, right? A control centre: kinda minor, but you can now hold down the TV button on the remote and access a menu similar to the iOS version\n\nThere are a few other minor updates (like wireless sound syncing and new screensavers), but these are just incremental features \u2014 even if they are useful.\n\nThis is one of the new screensavers, specifically one using Blue Planet footage.\n\nWhat Apple has done here \u2014 specifically with Apple Arcade and controllers \u2014 is give the Apple TV a point of differentiation: gaming.\n\nIn theory, you should be able to play a title on your mobile on the train, then arrive home and pick-up where you left off on the Apple TV. That\u2019s cool. It makes the hardware feel more relevant again, like it can do something none of its competitors can.\n\nBut what\u2019s the problem?\n\nWell, it\u2019s the hardware itself.\n\nThe Apple TV HD was launched in October 2015, while the 4K version was released in September 2017. That\u2019s old. This means the performance of some Apple Arcade games isn\u2019t really that great. If you\u2019re looking for a great gaming experience, you want something that can handle it.\n\nOr, if you view it another way, we\u2019re looking at hardware that\u2019s effectively coming to the end of its life before there\u2019s a clear reason to buy one. That\u2019s not a particularly appealing thing to say about a product, especially from Apple.\n\nHeres a picture of the Apple TV 4K so you don\u2019t get bored of all these stupid words everywhere.\n\nSo what would you do differently?\n\nIt always surprised me that something like Apple Arcade wasn\u2019t released ages ago, as gaming seemed like an ideal fit for the hardware. But at least we\u2019re there now.\n\nAnother thing I would\u2019ve loved to see would\u2019ve been Apple investing more in supporting tvOS developers. If you browse through the app store on the device it\u2019s\u2026 uninspiring. Deeply so. While the iPad, iPhone, and even the Apple Watch have apps that seem built for the system, there\u2019s really a lack of exciting software for the Apple TV. Any help the company could\u2019ve given to increase this community would\u2019ve paid dividends.\n\nIt\u2019d also be great if Apple could open up the Apple TV to more third-party video services from across the globe, even though I don\u2019t expect this to happen, as it\u2019s got this far with its walled-garden approach to software. You can always dream though.\n\nThen what\u2019s the future?\n\nBasically, I think the time of the current Apple TV devices is over. They\u2019re looking out-of-date and were never really developed to their full potential \u2014 which kinda sucks considering I\u2019ve owned mine for almost four years now.\n\nSo, yes, tvOS 13 is a step in the right direction, but it has come too late to save the current Apple TV crop \u2014 but it\u2019s good news for the next generation Apple TV.\n\nIf the company feels the pressure from Apple TV+, keeps updating tvOS, and maybe throws in a hardware surprise or two, the next generation of the Apple TV might end up being the first must-buy version of the hardware in an age. And for that, I\u2019m excited.\n\nThis post includes affiliate links to products that you can buy online.
