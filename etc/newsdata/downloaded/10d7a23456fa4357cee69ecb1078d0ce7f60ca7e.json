XRP price is currently under pressure and it could continue to move down towards $0.2750.\n\nRipple Price Analysis\n\nIn the past few hours, there was an increase in selling for bitcoin, ripple and Ethereum against the US Dollar. XRP price failed to hold a couple of important supports such as $0.2880 and $0.2850. As a result, there was a bearish break below the $0.2850 support area. Moreover, there was a close below the $0.2850 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.\n\nMore importantly, this week\u2019s followed key bullish trend line was breached with support near $0.2855 is intact on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even spiked below $0.2800 and traded as low as $0.2782. Recently, the price started an upside correction above the $0.2800 level. Additionally, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $0.2992 high to $0.2782 low.\n\nHowever, the previous support near the $0.2850 level is acting as a resistance. Moreover, the 100 hourly SMA is preventing recovery above $0.2860. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2860 on the same chart. Therefore, an upside break above the $0.2860 and $0.2880 is needed for a fresh increase in ripple in the near term.\n\nOn the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.2800 level. If the price fails to hold the $0.2800 support, there are chances of an extended decline below $0.2780. The next major support is near the $0.2750 level, below which the price could even trade towards the $0.2720 level.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price seems to be struggling to clear the $0.2850 resistance. If the bulls continue to face resistance near $0.2860 and $0.2850, the price could resume its decline. Conversely, a successful break above $0.2860 may perhaps push the price towards the $0.2920 level in the near term.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is struggling to stay in the bullish zone.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently just above the 40 level.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.2800, $0.2780 and $0.2750.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.2850, $0.2860 and $0.2920.", "description": "Ripple price is struggling to hold gains against the US Dollar and bitcoin.
