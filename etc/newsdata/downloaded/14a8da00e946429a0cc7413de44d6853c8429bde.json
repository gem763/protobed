Nothing much happened at the summit, and it\u2019s difficult to imagine how the radical carbon transformation they want will ever be implemented.\n\nThe next UN climate event is in Chile in December, but Chile is merely warm-up hype for the 26th Congress of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow 2020. That\u2019s when the world\u2019s climate bureaucrats, politicians and green CEOs will join 30,000 attendees in an attempt to renew the big target they set in Paris in 2015: Net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nThe two-week Glasgow event opens Nov. 9, 2020, six days after the U.S. election, providing more reason to doubt the net-zero carbon target will rise above the policy status it now enjoys as a meaningless talking point and policy mantra.\n\nCanada\u2019s high priest of climate policy, Environment Minister Catherine McKenna, performed the mantra perfectly this week when she announced that her Liberal government, if re-elected, would pursue the net-zero target. It was immediately obvious that the Trudeau government she represents has no idea how net-zero is even remotely feasible, economically or politically.\n\nWill the auto industry have moved to all electric within 30 years? Will steel be made without fossil fuels? Will natural gas be outlawed? One analyst calculated that to replace the electric power needed to offset the elimination of fossil fuels, Canada would have to build 2.5 hydro power dams the size of British Columbia\u2019s $13-billion Site C project somewhere in the country \u201cevery year for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nMcKenna pretty much admitted that there is nothing behind the net-zero carbon objective. \u201cDo we have all the details? No. But let\u2019s be clear: We are saying we need to be net-zero by 2050, we\u2019re saying we need experts to help show us the path to get there.\u201d\n\nBut there are no \u201cexperts\u201d to light the path to a zero-carbon future. It\u2019s a slogan, a buzzy catchphrase that has no scientific or economic foundation. When U.S. president John F. Kennedy announced in 1962 that the U.S. would send a man to the moon and bring him back, U.S. scientists knew it could be done.\n\nNobody has a clue about how to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, by 2050 or any other horizon. Christiana Figueres, former head of the UN\u2019s main climate agency, also says that \u201cIf we\u2019re not at one-half our emissions by 2030, there\u2019s no way they are going to be at net zero by 2050.\u201d\n\nThe nearby graph plotting the rise of global carbon emissions over the past 100 years \u2014 as the use of fossil fuels raised growth and global living standards \u2014 should be a convincing preliminary warning that slashing to net-zero over the next 30 years looks a tad unreasonable.\n\nIndependent academic and scientific literature supporting net-zero carbon \u2014 based on my attempts to track down real research \u2014 is essentially zero. There are massive volumes of policy pap from UN-related researchers, paid hacks of the World Economic Forum, wide-eyed theorists within the European Union, blue-sky reports from green financial promoters, and vague economic theories such a \u201ccarbon neutrality,\u201d \u201cthe circular economy\u201d and \u201cnatural capitalism.\u201d As the theorists stare at their blue skies, the world is building more coal plants, carbon emissions are rising, fossil-fuel use continues to increase, carbon emissions per capita are climbing and the push for more growth is as powerful as ever, especially from developing nations. Instead of moving to zero, their fossil-fuel use is rising and they want compensation and financial help.\n\nWhile the attempt to reshape the global economic order founders on the shore of economic reality, that has not stopped governments and various business/financial interests from declaring their support for net-zero carbon. So far, more than 60 nations have signed on to net-zero by 2050, along with scores of cities.\n\nAmong business groups, the latest to join the rush to zero is the United Nations-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance. Founded by the Quebec government\u2019s Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement and a couple of European financial institutions, and joined by pension managers and insurers in Europe and the United States \u2014 and supported by that well-known financial house, WWF \u2014 the Alliance members have committed to \u201ctransitioning their investment portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\u201d\n\nThe plan in the coming months leading up to Glasgow 2020 is to enlist other \u201cowners\u201d of pension and financial assets in the net-zero project. The Alliance\u2019s criteria and methods remain vague, but one of the drivers of this orchestrated investment attack on carbon has at least one clear objective: starve the fossil-fuel industry of capital.\n\nChristiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the UN climate framework convention, talked recently of how more than $6 trillion is shifting away from high carbon into low carbon. \u201cThe coal industry is now completely capital starved,\u201d she said, without mentioning China or India. \u201cThe oil and gas industry is already feeling the pain of our capital flight. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have a cent in their pocket, but it\u2019s much more difficult for them in a world in which the major financial institutions are saying: \u2018We\u2019re not going to find the finances anymore, and the insurance companies are not going to offer insurance.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSo that\u2019s at least one element of the net-zero carbon theory: starve industries, create capital flight. Can such a net-zero plan actually survive through to Glasgow 2020?\n\n\u2022 Email: tcorcoran@nationalpost.com | Twitter: terencecorcoran", "description": "At least one element of the net-zero carbon theory is to starve industries and create capital flight", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/oil-kills.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
