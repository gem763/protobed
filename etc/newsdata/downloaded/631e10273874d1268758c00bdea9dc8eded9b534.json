All our hard work and efforts in previous days and years were to get us to this moment,\u201d Roni al-Asaad, a 32-year-old activist in central Beirut, said.\n\n\u201cIf they could have implemented these reforms before, why haven\u2019t they? And why should we believe them today?\u201d\n\nWhat was initially dubbed the \u201cWhatsApp revolution\u201d morphed into a mass non-partisan push for a total overhaul of a sectarian power system still run mostly by civil war-era warlords, three decades after the end of the country\u2019s conflict.\n\nDemonstrators, old and young, spoke of their joy of experiencing a rare feeling of national unity as they converged towards protest sites at the weekend.\n\nGiven the size of the gatherings, the five-day-old mobilisation has been remarkably incident free, with armies of volunteers forming to clean up the streets, provide water to protesters and organise first aid tents.\n\nLebanon\u2019s debt-burdened economy has been sliding towards collapse in recent months, adding to the economic woes of a population exasperated by rampant corruption, the lack of job opportunities and poor services.\n\nForest fires also devastated parts of the country last week, with politicians accused of inaction as the country burned.\n\nAmong the protesters\u2019 main grievances is the poor supply of electricity from the state, which citizens have to complement with costly generators.\n\nUsually prone to blame anti-government mobilisation on another party or a foreign conspiracy, Lebanon\u2019s top political figures have appeared to acknowledge that none of them were spared by public anger.\n\nThe powerful Shiite movement Hezbollah, which has the country\u2019s most powerful militia and also dominates political life, agreed to Hariri\u2019s reform package, a senior cabinet official said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Volcano\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe embattled premier went live on television Friday, on the second of protests, to give his uneasy coalition partners 72 hours to back his rescue plan.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in the street is a volcano that can\u2019t be contained with timely solutions,\u201d Imad Salamey, a political science professor at the Lebanese American University, said.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for the demonstrators to regain trust in the state in 72 hours and with solutions only presented on paper,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deadline expires at 7:00 pm Monday (1600 GMT) and Hariri\u2019s wording suggested he could resign if his move failed.\n\nLebanon\u2019s embattled political leaders have warned that the government\u2019s resignation at this time would only deepen the country\u2019s crisis.\n\nAl-Akhbar newspaper, which is close to Hezbollah, published a picture of protesters carrying a giant flag on its front page with a commentary on \u201cTest Day: Power or People?\u201d.\n\nThe French-language newspaper L\u2019Orient Le Jour said \u201cThe hour of truth has arrived.\u201d\n\nSeveral hundred thousand people demonstrated in central Beirut alone on Sunday, with massive gatherings spreading across all regions of the small Mediterranean country.\n\nSchools, banks, universities and many private businesses closed their doors Monday, both for security reasons and in an apparent bid to encourage people to join the demonstrations.", "description": "Beirut (AFP) \u2013 Lebanon\u2019s teetering government was expected Monday to approve a belated economic rescue plan as the nation prepared for a fifth", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/21/8709b4_hundreds-thousands-people-joined-protests-demanding-sweeping-overhaul-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
