(AP) - When the Washington Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018, they did so after their championship window was supposed to be closed.\n\nUnlike when a roster shake-up and infusion of youth actually augmented the core of Alex Ovechkin, Nicklas Backstrom, Braden Holtby and John Carlson, the Capitals now face a more immediate challenge. With contracts for Backstrom and Holtby up after this season and Ovechkin after next year, it\u2019s unclear how long this era of success will last.\n\n\u201cWith the age of our team, every year is a sense of urgency in my mind,\u201d general manager Brian MacLellan said. \u201cIt took us a while to get to the point where we did win a championship, and I don\u2019t know how long our window is here. We\u2019re getting a little older, but we also have some good young guys coming up, so I think we can continue to compete at a high level.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals still have a potential 50-goal scorer in Ovechkin , a perennial 70-point playmaker in Backstrom, an elite defenseman in Carlson and a Vezina Trophy winning goaltender in Holtby. And with the talent around them, including forwards Evgeny Kuznetsov, Tom Wilson, Jakub Vrana and T.J. Oshie, defensemen Dmitry Orlov and Michal Kempny, Washington is a threat to win the Cup again.\n\n\u201cWe have a high expectation here,\u201d second-year head coach Todd Reirden said. \u201cWe expect to be extremely competitive. We expect to be amongst the league leaders in terms of wins and points. That\u2019s the culture that we\u2019ve established, and now we need to continue to build it.\u201d\n\nOvechkin is 34, Backstrom 31 and Holtby 30. The same salary cap and aging questions that faced the champion Chicago Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh Penguins will soon confront the Capitals. MacLellan seems to know when to make free agency moves (defensemen Brooks Orpik and Matt Niskanen in 2014), when to let key players go (Marcus Johansson, Karl Alzner and Justin Williams in 2017) and when to dole out big contract extensions (Kuznetsov and Oshie in 2017 and Carlson and Wilson in 2018).\n\nThe reigning Presidents\u2019 Trophy winning Tampa Bay Lightning and defending conference champion Boston Bruins remain formidable challengers in the East . Just in the Metropolitan Division, the Penguins and New York Islanders aren\u2019t going away and the New Jersey Devils, New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers all got better.\n\nBut the Capitals are still an established power to be reckoned with.\n\nWHO\u2019S HERE\n\nFree agent signings Richard Panik, Garnet Hathaway and Brendan Leipsic were brought in to revamp the bottom six forward spots. Rugged defenseman Radko Gudas, acquired in a trade from Philadelphia, is the Orpik replacement on defense because of the size and muscle he brings.\n\n\u201cSome of the players we added were not by accident,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what you can look to see: some guys that aren\u2019t necessarily all that fun to play against.\u201d\n\nWHO\u2019S NOT\n\nNiskanen was a salary-cap casualty sent to Philadelphia for Gudas, and forward Brett Connolly left in free agency to sign a $14 million, four-year deal with Florida. Reirden will coach a team without Orpik for the first time in his decade in the NHL after the 38-year-old retired and moved into Washington\u2019s player development department.\n\n\u201cHis strength as a person and as a leader will translate well into the role he\u2019s in,\u201d MacLellan said. \u201cMost of the young guys in our organization already know him. There\u2019s a comfort there with him. He\u2019s just fresh out of the gate, so he\u2019s up to date on all our coaches, all of the guys in our room, so it\u2019s a great fit for the organization.\u201d\n\nKuznetsov will miss the first three games of the season after being suspended by the league for inappropriate conduct stemming from a positive cocaine test at the world championships and a meeting with Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n\nKEY PLAYERS\n\nThis team is still led by Ovechkin and Backstrom, and also features Kuznetsov and backstopped by Holtby. The play6er to watch is Wilson, who is coming off a career year of 22 goals and 40 points in 63 games.\n\nWilson, 25, wants to be more consistent, and the sky\u2019s the limit if he stays out of suspension trouble and plays close to 80 games.\n\n\u201cThe offense obviously is everyone\u2019s big thing over the years,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to continue to be there. If you\u2019re playing (big) minutes and you\u2019re playing on the first line you have to be able to chip in, and that\u2019s what I plan to do.\u201d\n\nOUTLOOK\n\nFor the first time fans should get to see what Reirden hockey truly looks like. He took over for Barry Trotz after the Cup celebration and a short summer that didn\u2019t give him much time to overhaul systems. The Capitals could look like a different team.\n\n\u201cYou can expect us to be more aggressive in different areas of the ice,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cYou can expect us to play that type of style of game where our speed and skating is a really important factor for us.\u201d\n\nPREDICTION\n\nWashington should win the Metropolitan Division for a fifth consecutive season and with better injury fortune make it out of the first round. In what could be Holtby\u2019s final playoff run, his play in goal will go a long way to determining how far the Capitals go.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "When the Washington Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018, they did so after their championship window was supposed to be closed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Whyno"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/23/capitals_preview_hockey_86828_c0-366-2664-1919_s1770x1032.jpg?2c1b70371802c13e843ef436ef22cd31171fe10c", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
