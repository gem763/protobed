Plant a window box\n\nYou may not have any outside space of your own, but you\u2019ll likely have a window or two. So, rig up a window box and scatter some wild flower seeds. Bees are fond of colourful, tubular flowers like foxgloves and love lavender, borage, catmint and buttercups. (What could be nicer than the scent of lavender wafting into the room?) Our buzzing, stripy pals are also partial to the pink blooms of chives. Add this to your window box and you\u2019ll always have the herb on hand for cooking with too.\n\n2. Don't bother mowing\n\nIf you're lucky enough to have some lawn, you might feel a bit embarrassed to sit on your hands and watch it go to seed, sprouting dark patches and thick tussocks. But leave it a few months and soon the space will be a biodiverse patchwork of wild flowers and different grasses \u2013 attracting a plethora of butterflies and other six-legged friends. Meadow grass, buttercup and dandelion all provide favourite seeds for a whole range of birds too.", "description": "Abandon the lawn mower, let nature take control and transform your life with plants.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07phtbq.jpg"}
