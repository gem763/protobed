And if you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019re already able to take advantage of the new feature within Gmail on iOS and Android. We\u2019ve already written about the latter, and now we\u2019re here with a quick guide to enabling dark mode on the former\u2014if you can access it.\n\nI phrase that as I do, for Google is, as always, rolling out the dark mode feature to Gmail users. You might have it; you might not. Make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of Gmail from the App Store before you give this a try, and if you still can\u2019t enable dark mode, set a reminder for yourself to check back in a week or so and try again. (It\u2019s worth the wait.)\n\nTo get started with dark mode on Gmail for iOS, you\u2019ll want to turn on the system-wide dark theme within iOS itself:\n\nPull up Settings Tap Display & Brightness Tap \u201cDark\u201d under Appearance. (If you\u2019re using automatic mode, know that your theme will switch between light and dark depending on however you\u2019ve set that up.)\n\nThat should be all you need; once you get access to dark mode within the Gmail app, the app\u2019s theme should switch over automatically. However, if you\u2019re going with the Light Side for your system-wide look in iOS, but want to give your Gmail a spookier feel for whatever reason, you can also force dark mode within the app. As CNET describes:\n\nPull up your Gmail app Tap the hamburger icon in the upper-left corner Scroll allllll the way down and tap Settings Tap the new \u201cTheme\u201d option, if present, and select \u201cDark\u201d\n\nI confess, dark mode hasn\u2019t rolled out to my version of Gmail on iOS yet, so I can\u2019t give you a pretty screenshot of what this looks like. But I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2014and you\u2014will get a darker look soon. I can\u2019t wait.", "description": "Finally, my favourite email app is getting dark mode.
