I am committed to leading the Intelligence Community to address the diverse and complex threats facing our nation.\u201d\n\nThe Post report, which cited \"current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter,\" said that Maguire had threatened to turn in his resignation over concerns that the White House might try to make him stonewall Congress. He is set to testify Thursday about a whistleblower complaint that has spurred House Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\nREAD THE FULL TRANSCRIPT HERE\n\nThe White House has also denied that Maguire threatened to resign, with Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham complaining on Twitter that the Post had only given them six minutes to respond to their request for comment.\n\n\u201cThis is actually not true,\u201d Grisham said of the newspaper\u2019s story. \u201cAnd we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond.\u201d\n\nThe account of Maguire\u2019s resignation threat is another subplot in the furor enveloping Washington in the aftermath of revelations concerning the unnamed whistleblower\u2019s complaint.\n\nUKRAINE CALL TRANSCRIPT SHOWS TRUMP SOUGHT BIDEN PROBE, ASKED ABOUT DNC SERVER, BUT MADE NO MENTION OF US AID\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the White House released a transcript of Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showing Trump broached a review of dealings in the Eastern European country involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great,\u201d Trump said in the phone call. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJoe Biden has stated that while vice president, he urged Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Shokin had been investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board. Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention.\n\nThe transcript, though, did not show Trump explicitly linking the request to $400 million in American aid to Ukraine, which at the time was on hold.\n\nFox News\u2019 Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.", "description": "Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire denied a report by The Washington Post Wednesday that he had threatened to resign amid the clamor over\u00a0President Trump\u2019s July phone call\u00a0with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/AP19220853483440.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
