A newly formed Native American Coalition is made up of members who hail from tribal organizations in 15 states and include both grass-roots leaders and elected officials.\n\n\u201cThe daily flood of new federal regulations keep Indian Country from becoming self-sufficient. Local tribal decisions, not federal bureaucrats, are the best way to improve our communities. As both an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation and a member of Congress, I will stand with Donald Trump in supporting tribal sovereignty and reining in federal over-regulation,\u201d said Rep. Markwayne Mullin, Oklahoma Republican and chairman of the group.\n\n\u201cAs a local elected official, I am outraged that Indian Country is prevented from harnessing our own energy resources by ever-increasing regulations,\u201d said New Mexico State Rep. Sharon Clahchischilliage. \u201cThe Trump administration will ease restrictions on American energy reserves worth trillions of dollars. Together we will block the bureaucrats holding Native American businesses back and bring new jobs into our communities.\u201d\n\nSee Mr. Trump\u2019s complete announcement here\n\nThe organization also cites other troublesome policies.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s war on coal interferes with our sovereign right to develop energy on native lands. We need a new traffic cop so the federal government stops playing gatekeeper with tribal economies,\u201d said Ross Swimmer, former Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.\n\nFormer Poarch Band of Creek Indian chairman Eddie Tullis noted that Mrs. Clinton \u201cfavors union bosses over tribal authority,\u201d suggesting that native communities be treated like state governments in labor matters.\n\n\u201cNative Americans need a federal government that gets out of the way of small business. As an independent and a successful small businessman, I crossed the line this week and voted for Mr. Trump,\u201d said Fleming Begaye Sr., one of America\u2019s revered Navajo Code Talkers, and an honorary chairman of the new coalition.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
