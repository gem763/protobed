There were only us there and two teenage girls around 15 or 16 years old watching us,\" Mr Sand\u00e9, of east Hull, said.\n\n\"I was fuming. I wasn't going to let someone intimidate us and speak to us like that so I went to tell the manager.\n\n(Image: hulldailymail.co.uk)\n\n\"I was getting angry, my friends were scared and anxious. He called me a stupid white boy. If it was the other way around I would get done for racism.\n\n\"He was being abusive and racist to us. The manager said to him to calm down and told him we were ordering from our phones. He started putting his hands in the air and laughing.\n\n\"When I was telling the manager what had happened he was trying to scare me into not telling him. I told the manager about him punching the table and he denied it. He kept saying, ''shut up, shut up.'\"\n\nThe manager offered the group some free McFlurries to try and resolve the issue.\n\nBut the diner remains upset and intends to take the matter further.\n\n(Image: hulldailymail.co.uk)\n\n\"Security guards in nightclubs aren't like that but he was in McDonald's. I was getting angry and told him to 'f*** off' and called him a fake cop. I was really intimidated and angry and didn't want it to kick off,\" he added.\n\n\"I messaged McDonald's on Twitter this morning and was going to go to the police but I don't think they'll be able to do anything.\n\n\"I'm not going back to that McDonald's again.\"\n\n(Image: hulldailymail.co.uk)\n\nMcDonald's acknowledges an incident happened at around midnight.
