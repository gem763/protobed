It\u2019s more of a Freddy Krueger, actually. I didn\u2019t realise I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.\u2019\n\nBachman was booed by members of the audience, with one person shouting \u2018shut up\u2019.\n\nWeinstein was at the Actors Hour event (Picture: Zoe Stuckless)\n\nKelly Bachman addressed the Freddy Krueger in the room (Picture: Facebook)\n\nShe continued: \u2018Sorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors. I have been raped, surprisingly not by anyone here, and I\u2019ve never been able to confront those guys, so just a general \u201cF*** you\u201d.\u2019\n\nAccording to Stuckless, who spoke to Vulture, later in the event, a male comedian started his set by saying: \u2018We gotta talk about the elephant in the room. Yeah, who\u2019s the elephant that produced Good Will Hunting? Cause that s*** was amazing!\u2019\n\nStuckless later went up to Weinstein\u2019s table; in a video shared to their Facebook, they could be seen screaming at him and saying: \u2018Nobody\u2019s going to say anything? Nobody\u2019s really going to say anything?\u2019\n\nThey were asked to leave the venue.\n\nAmber Rollo tweeted about the event, writing: \u2018I was shocked to see him out, but not because I thought he would have shame, he is a sociopath and clearly has no shame. I\u2019m shocked because he was invited to an event put on by and for artists.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nZoe was asked to leave the venue Picture: Zoe Stuckless)\n\n\u2018Downtime Bar NYC, you might remember it as Mockingbird in LES, allowed this man to stay at this event put on by Actors Hour. Actors Hour and the woman who runs it Alexandra Laliberte apparently invited Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Not only was he invited he was supported. My friend and bad ass comedian @bellykachman was performing on the show and when she went after \u201cFreddy Krueger\u201d SHE was booed and told to shut up.\u2019\n\nShe alleged that she called Weinstein a \u2018f***ing monster and told him he should disappear\u2019, adding: \u2018His friend/body guard/goon/family member called me a c*** and I really really wanted to lunge over the table and strangle him.\n\n\u2018I restrained myself, now that I\u2019m sober I no longer throw drinks or fists. There was a woman at the table with him who gently guided me out. I don\u2019t know who she is but I hope she is ok.\u2019\n\nA rep for Weinstein said: \u2018Harvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down.\n\nWeinstein has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex (Picture: AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\n\u2018This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u2019\n\nWeinstein is currently out on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to charges of rape, a criminal sex act, sex abuse, and sexual misconduct charges for incidents involving two women in May 2018.\n\nHe categorically denies any allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\nPrior to the criminal charges being taken, Weinstein was accused of sexual misconduct by over 80 women following an expose in the New York Times in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a now deleted Instagram post from Actors Hour, they claimed that Weinstein was not invited to the showcase.\n\nIt read: \u2018In light of the events last night, we feel it is important to state that Harvey Weinstein was NOT invited by the organiser or anyone associated with this organisation.\n\n\u2018We believe the people who spoke out were brave and justified and we fully encourage freedom of speech. We apologise wholeheartedly for the way the situation was handled.\n\n\u2018Actor\u2019s Hour is a free space for Artists of all kinds and we regret that last night it did not feel that way for many. For that, we are deeply sorry.\n\n\u2018We sincerely hope that what we have built over the past year speaks louder than last night\u2019s event.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
