Is that a coincidence? Putin has already secured a deal between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian government. His next act, as we have written, is a renewed border security pact between Ankara and Damascus. Whether the cease-fire holds or not, the summit in Sochi will be the benchmark for what happens next. Russia is already coordinating with Syria and Iran, so Putin has all his cards in play. If he can move Erdogan toward a withdrawal, and an eventual end to hostilities with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, we may be at the beginning of Putin\u2019s plan for the endgame in Syria.\n\nIraqi street may not wait for reforms\n\nIraq Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s response to the protests, which kicked off Oct. 1, has been aggressive, including government support for more job opportunities, affordable housing and various subsidies. He has sacked 61 officials and initiated an investigation into police officers who reportedly fired on protesters.\n\nAlso read\n\nBut it is a race against time, with the prospect of renewed protests after the Arbaeen (\"fortieth day\") religious holiday ends Oct. 25.\n\nIraqi security forces have arrested and detained hundreds of people, and internet service has been heavily restricted, to clamp down on organizers and activists. The death toll exceeds 120, with 6,000 wounded. Mustafa Saadoun reports that although 500 of the 800 detainees were released, many activists are fleeing the country, fearing being killed or detained by Iranian-backed militias, or Popular Mobilization Units (PMU). The PMU are alleged to have been involved in some of the more violent responses to the protests, including snipers firing at demonstrators.\n\nMeanwhile, Iraqi President Barham Salih is also seizing the mantle of reform. In a prescient interview with Al-Monitor just days before the protests, he said that Iraq\u2019s leaders cannot be diverted from their \u201creal mission\u201d of providing jobs for Iraq\u2019s unemployed graduates and youth, and that corruption was the \"political economy of conflict.\" Salih is pressing for a constitutional amendment to change the country\u2019s electoral law in consultation with a wide segment of Iraqi leaders and UN experts.\n\nGovernment fears \u2018snowball effect\u2019 after religious holiday\n\nAbdul Mahdi announced Oct. 8 that he had reached an agreement with so-called coordination committees to postpone the protests, which had called for the downfall of the \"regime,\" until after Arbaeen, which begins Oct. 20.\n\nBut Saadoun reports \u201cit seems that statement was just designed to calm the public. The Iraqi protests do not have any coordination committees or known leaders, and Abdul Mahdi\u2019s office did not post any photos of its supposed meeting with such parties.\u201d\n\nThe Arbaeen holiday draws millions of Iraqis and others, including Iranians, to Karbala.\n\n\u201cArbaeen itself might not trigger protests,\u201d writes Saadoun, \u201cbut it will constitute a mobilization and awareness-raising occasion to stage a huge protest in the coming days.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Iraqi government is well aware that an Arbaeen protest would have a snowball effect if it expands beyond crowds visiting Hussein's shrine,\u201d adds Saadoun. \u201cIn such a case, it would carry different messages, one of them being that Shiite visitors protested against the Shiite government and that any action against protesters, no matter how much their protests escalate, would put the final nail in the coffin of the legitimacy of Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government.\u201d\n\nThe widespread demonstrations occurred only in predominantly Shiite provinces, not in Sunni or Kurdish regions, Adnan Abu Zeed reports, but that could change.\n\n\u201cThis is bound to happen if the government does not provide better services, infrastructure and employment,\u201d he writes. \u201cDisparity between the people and the political class and the spread of poverty are issues everyone is facing irrespective of their sectarian belonging.\u201d\n\nAbdul Mahdi has the backing of the key Kurdish parties, which have acknowledged the right to peaceful protests, but consider the prime minister and his government the best partner to resolve outstanding issues between Baghdad and Erbil, including over Kirkuk, oil revenues and the region\u2019s share of the federal budget, as Omar Sattar reports.\n\nSadr tells Iraqis to \u2018mobilize by the millions\u2019\n\nPopulist cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who has called for Abdul Mahdi\u2019s resignation, is telling his followers to \"mobilize by the millions\" during Arbaeen.\n\nSadr\u2019s Sairoon (\u201cForward\u201d) political coalition is the largest bloc in the Council of Representatives (parliament). Sadr was caught off guard by the demonstrations last time, and if there are protests next week, he plans to be in the mix and position himself as the broker of the eventual compromise, if it comes to that. Sadr keeps his ties to Iran, which backs Abdul Mahdi. He and other Iraqi leaders are wary of the precedent of the street taking down a prime minister, but they are monitoring the trends.\n\nSistani, under pressure from Soleimani, keeps distance from Baghdad\n\nGrand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the most influential Shiite cleric in Iraq, has blessed the protests and, Ali Mamouri reports, has rejected the prime minister\u2019s requests for support.\n\nSistani is in a tough spot. \u201cAlthough he has long criticized successive Iraqi governments for failing to build a functional state and provide sufficient services to the citizens, many Iraqis consider him the mastermind of the Iraqi political process since 2003,\u201d Mamouri writes. \u201cTherefore, he is trying to distance himself from the government as much as possible, pressuring behind the scenes for reforms.\u201d\n\nSistani\u2019s stance puts him at odds with Iran, which backs the government. Iran, for its part, is becoming increasingly unpopular among Iraqis because of the behavior of rogue PMU and its heavy hand in perceived Iraqi corruption. But Tehran\u2019s hold is still strong.\n\nMamouri adds that the \u201ccommander of Iran's Quds Force Qasem Soleimani is in Najaf since last week. He has warned Sistani that he should make it clear whether he is with the protesters or with the government. Sistani has already expressed his full support to the protesters' demands.\u201d\n\nSyria makes it all that much harder for now\n\nThe economic reforms required to stabilize Iraq are daunting \u2014 including a massive overhaul of the banking and electricity sectors \u2014 to name just two cited by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). And the impact of a reform package will take time, and certainly won\u2019t be solved by the end of Arbaeen next week. As we explained here, in reference to Egypt, even a successful IMF-based reform program may not be enough to quiet the streets, given the demographic realities. Iraq has 38 million people \u2014 roughly 40% under 14 years of age, and about 58% under 24 \u2014 and an unemployment rate of about 15%, which is much higher for the under 24 cohort.\n\nThe Turkish invasion of Syria made it that much harder for Iraq. More than 1,000 Syrian refugees have crossed into Iraq since Oct. 9. Iraq already hosts over 250,000 displaced Syrians, mostly in the Kurdistan Region, where an estimated 1 million Iraqis upended by the Islamic State (IS) have yet to be resettled. Iraqi leaders fear that IS prisoners escaping from Syria may find their way into Iraq. Iraq has also agreed to repatriate and put on trial 4,000 Iraqis who had been detained in Syria, a move that, while welcomed by the international community, will strain Iraq\u2019s judicial and prison systems.\n\nConcern about the potential spillover effects of the Syrian conflict was a focus of the meeting in Baghdad this week between Salih and US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker, as well as Iraqi national security adviser Falah al-Fayyad\u2019s meeting with Assad in Damascus.\n\nWith the US withdrawal from Syria, Iraq becomes even more pivotal in the battle against IS holdovers. The Pentagon may consider expanding its footprint and engagement with Iraq accordingly, but in a manner not to upend the fragile political and economic situation.", "description": "The crisis in Syria has only made Iraq\u2019s problems worse.", "authors": ["Week In Review"], "top_image": "https://9c998969b63acdb676d1-37595348221e1b716e1a6cfee3ed7891.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/almpics/2019/10/RTX76KU9.jpg/RTX76KU9-870.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
