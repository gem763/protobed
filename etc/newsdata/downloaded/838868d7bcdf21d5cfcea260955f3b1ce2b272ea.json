It was a highly controversial move that Mr. Stack said cost the company \u201cpretty close\u201d to $250 million.\n\n\u201cAbout a quarter of a billion,\u201d Mr. Stack said when asked how much the company lost during a CBS interview aired Sunday.\n\nHe said the company turned $5 million worth of weapons pulled from store shelves into scrap metal.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You know what? If we really think these things should be off the street, we need to destroy them,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nDespite the blow to business, Mr. Stack said he is weighing pulling all firearms from store shelves.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the whole category under strategic review to see what we\u2019re going to do with this category,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo many people say to me, you know, \u2018If we do what you want to do, it\u2019s not going to stop these mass shootings,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd my response is, \u2018You\u2019re probably right, it won\u2019t.
