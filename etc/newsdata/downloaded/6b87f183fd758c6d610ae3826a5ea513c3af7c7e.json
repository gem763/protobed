They don\u2019t call this murky, winding waterway the \u201chiding place\u201d for nothing. Before I can search the shockingly cold water for fish, I call out for a lifejacket to go with my ill-fitting wetsuit, foggy mask and wobbly snorkel.\n\nMy body remembers swimming with salmon once before in much warmer water on the other side of the country. The way you are supposed to wear a lifejacket and float like a starfish, letting the current carry you while you fight the urge to propel yourself with disruptive breast strokes and vigorous kicks. The way that being motionless frees you to stare deeply into the depths. How, if you are lucky enough to swim over or alongside a salmon, you should look but not touch.\n\nI know what I\u2019m doing, but I can\u2019t make the fish appear.\n\nNEWSLETTERS Beast Travel Digest Get the entire world in your inbox.

We hopped in the back of his Ford F-150 yesterday and drove around the Gitsegukla First Nation, learning about totem poles and how he cleans, smokes, and dries salmon behind his house.\n\n\u201cHave you ever swum with salmon?\u201d I asked, chewing on his dried fish and trying to come up with some unusual salmon small-talk to see what wisdom he might pass on.\n\n\u201cNoooo.\u201d Williams shut me down with one word, so I didn\u2019t tell him about snorkeling with salmon with researchers in New Brunswick a few years ago, writing a book about fishing experiences, or coming to northern British Columbia just to stay at Bear Claw Lodge and kayak to a spot where I can, hopefully, snorkel with salmon.\n\nI stay in the unseasonably frigid Kispiox River longer than everyone else, longing for the sensation of being enveloped in a school of fish making their way home to spawn in the gravelly river bottom and then die. The others clearly prefer being on\u2014not in\u2014the Kispiox, kayaking the drizzly day away while waiting to see if the fog will lift so we can go heli-horseback riding and heli-hiking on a nearby mountain. I\u2019ve never heli-anythinged, but salmon migrations trump helicopters in my world.\n\nWe are 800 miles north of Vancouver in the part of British Columbia that\u2019s closer to Alaska than Alberta and that\u2019s rich in five kinds of salmon\u2014chinook, sockeye, coho, chum and pink\u2014plus steelhead trout. The chinooks should have been here by now. Their absence could be blamed on climate change, overfishing, unpopular government regulations for commercial and recreational fishers, natural four-year life cycles, the weather, all of the above, or none of the above.\n\nSalmon is part of most conversations up here. It has always been a staple food for many of the 203 Indigenous communities in this province, and anglers pay big bucks to come to wilderness lodges every fall for its cousin, steelhead trout, \u201cthe silver ghosts.\u201d Canada\u2019s Department of Fisheries and Oceans keeps tabs on the numbers of returning salmon and restricts the fishery whenever those numbers are low. To help protect the salmon, Bear Claw Lodge lets people swim/snorkel with them but not fish for them, and it will take guests fly fishing for steelheads, strictly catch-and-release.\n\nMy summer salmon journey begins in Smithers, an alpine-themed mountain town of 5,400 \u201cSmithereens\u201d and one superlative lasagna at Telly\u2019s Grill plus the oddball \u201cAlpenman,\u201d an iconic wooden statue of a man dubbed Alpine Al blowing an alpenhorn. At Smithers Brewing Co., co-owner Blaine Estby did everything possible to not play up the clich\u00e9d fish angle, but after going in endless circles trying to design a logo, the brewery chose a stylized \u201cSmithers salmon with a wheat belly.\u201d\n\nDriving north from Smithers, we pit-stop along the Bulkley River at Witset (Moricetown) where members of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en Nation practice a traditional Indigenous way of fishing. One man, tethered to shore with a long rope, wearing street clothes and not a protective wetsuit, uses a long dip net to scoop fish from the treacherous Widzin Kwah Canyon. It\u2019s as beautiful and dangerous a dance with nature as I\u2019ve ever seen, and infinitely more graceful than my awkward slithering in shallow pools along the Kispiox in search of these same fish.\n\nKaleigh Allen, part of the family that runs Bear Claw Lodge, guides my kayaking/attempted snorkelling with salmon outing. From her elevated perch atop a paddle board with her Karelian bear dog Willy, she suddenly spots telltale flashes of red in two pools along the way and calls out \u201cchinooks.\u201d The first one instantly vanishes in the murky water, but I dive in after the second one, a big, blotchy red, pink and white creature that is \u201cnot dead yet but on his way out\u201d after spawning.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not a fish person and you get in a big pool with fish decaying all around you, you won\u2019t like it,\u201d Allen quietly confides. I am a fish person and so swimming with salmon, even at the end of their incredible river-to-ocean-and-back lifecycle, is weirdly appealing.\n\nBut it\u2019s not meant to be. I climb out of the Kispiox defeated, relieved to have survived this cold-water foolishness and concerned that the chinooks might be in trouble. (They do eventually arrive, just later and in smaller numbers than usual, while the sockeyes and pinks run on schedule.)\n\nSalmon appear almost everywhere else that I go while in the north, though.\n\nAt the \u2019Ksan Historical Village, a living museum of the Gitxsan people, interpreter Samantha Johnson shows homemade wooden traps traditionally used to catch salmon and shares how fish eggs (roe) are eaten with seaweed, while the flesh is hung in the smokehouse to be preserved for winter. One lovely saying about resilience and adaptation is popular with her community: \u201cWe are a new people. We are an old people. We are the same people, deeper than before.\u201d\n\nI also spent several carefree hours cruising down the Skeena River with Northern BC Jet Boat Tours, watching Indigenous fishers along the way and finding grizzly prints in the sand where we stop for a shore lunch with owner Rob Bryce and Fred Seiler. The river draws its name from the Gitxsan word \u201cksan\u201d for \u201criver of the mists.\u201d Bryce has forged ties with Indigenous communities and so we are welcomed ashore at Gitsegukla, part of the Gitxsan Nation, by Clyde Williams and two hereditary chiefs, Roddy Johnson and Vernon Milton.\n\nThe men recite a traditional greeting and then sing and drum. As we meander around the Gitxsan village of 400 people in Williams\u2019 truck, I comment on how nobody else is out and about. Williams, a tree faller who works in the logging industry, shrugs: \u201cIt\u2019s always quiet. People are home. Some are doing nothing. Some are eating and breathing and just living the rez life. A lot are working.\u201d Reserves are private property in Canada and not always welcoming to strangers, so I am grateful for the chance to pepper the amiable Williams with questions about modern Indigenous life.\n\nAs an Indigenous person, he has special fishing rights and can use nets to catch salmon in the Skeena River. He has left a couple of chinook and sockeyes in a pink plastic water tank overnight so their flesh will become extra tender and juicy. Williams pulls a \u201cjack spring\u201d (small chinook) from the tank and deftly cleans it, dumping the guts in a bucket that will soon be returned to the river.\n\n\u201cThis will be perfect for supper,\u201d he says of the fish. \u201cFilet. Wrap in foil. Barbecue.\u201d Johnson, who is quietly watching, is gifted with fish heads for soup. Williams likes to add fish eggs to his soup, something his twin sons \u2014 who are grown and now live off-reservation \u2014 have dubbed Fear Factor Soup after the American game show.\n\nThe smokehouse is a no-frills wooden shack where Williams burns cottonwood, no bark, very dry and light. Thin salmon strips hang from wooden poles over a shouldering fire and pile of ash. The salmon that I sample has been smoked for a couple of days and is chewy, plain and pure. \u201cToday\u2019s generation,\u201d explains Williams, \u201cthey\u2019ve got candied fish strips. They\u2019ve got all kinds of crazy ingredients. We\u2019re one of the few that only have it this way. We haven\u2019t done it any other way \u2014 yet. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to go any other way with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you get the bones out?\u201d he is asked. \u201cFilet it before or they\u2019re in there?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Chew it up. You\u2019re never going to choke on the bones. I haven\u2019t choked on bones yet.\u201d\n\nInside the smokehouse are thinner salmon strips that will hang for two or three weeks. \u201cLook at that,\u201d exclaims Williams, pointing to a gnawed strip. \u201cSomething\u2019s got a hold of it. A squirrel. He found it, the little scoundrel.\u201d I am not squeamish but wonder whether it is wise to chew where squirrels have chewed. The strips will go into the freezer so Williams can pull them out and pair them with a bag of plain potato chips for \u201cfish and chips.\u201d I long to taste this clever blending of old and new.\n\nSo I didn\u2019t successfully swim with a school of spawning salmon in northern British Columbia, but I swam in the vicinity of at least one dying fish and got to eat dried salmon with Williams. I didn\u2019t take a helicopter to the top of a mountain to ride a horse, but I rode through the Enchanted Forest where the Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s The Revenant was almost filmed among old-growth hemlocks and cedars, and I fell in love with what they call \u201choley rocks\u201d\u2014rocks with dramatic, weathered holes. I didn\u2019t see a Kermode Spirit Bear, although the rare subspecies of the American black bear with a recessive gene lives up here and we dipped into the edge of the Great Bear Rainforest, but I saw a taxidermied Kermode in the Terrace airport and admired some of the white bear statues around town.\n\nMy journey starts with salmon and ends, strangely, with lava.\n\nBefore driving through the Nisga\u2019a Nation, we stop to meet Bertram Mercer, economic development manager for the Nisga\u2019a Lisims Government. We talk of salmon, commercial smokehouses, elusive Kermodes and a little-known volcanic eruption from nearly 300 years ago. The mid-1700s natural disaster spewed out a river of molten rock that drowned two villages and killed 2,000 people.\n\nNow this area is called Nisga\u2019a Memorial Lava Bed Park and is jointly managed and protected by the first nation and the provincial government. Exploring some of its 15 surreal square miles, I take a quiet walk down Crater Creek Trail, a petrified sea of lava rocks blanketed in white and green lichen. The lava beds are an unfathomable 98-feet deep in spots.\n\n\u201cWil Ksi Baxhl Mihl (\u201cWhere the Fire Ran Out\u201d) is sacred ground,\u201d an interpretive sign explains in English and the Nisga\u2019a language. \u201cPlease respect this ground. Tread lightly and leave the lava rocks where they are, for they are the headstones of our forefathers.\u201d Like rivers that hold spawning salmon, this ecosystem is fragile and so I try not to disrupt it, torn between protecting it by staying silent and sharing its powerful, untold story.", "description": "So long as you can get them to show up!", "authors": ["Jennifer Bain"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569106304/190922-bain-salmon-snorkeling-hero_lebml2", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
