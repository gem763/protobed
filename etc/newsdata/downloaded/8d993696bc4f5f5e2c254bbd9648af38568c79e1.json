Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So we'll take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Canterbury Resources Limited (ASX:CBY).\n\nWhat Is Insider Buying?\n\nMost investors know that it is quite permissible for company leaders, such as directors of the board, to buy and sell stock in the company. However, most countries require that the company discloses such transactions to the market.\n\nWe would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But equally, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. As Peter Lynch said, 'insiders might sell their shares for any number of reasons, but they buy them for only one: they think the price will rise.'\n\nSee our latest analysis for Canterbury Resources\n\nCanterbury Resources Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nMD & Executive Director Grant Craighead made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for AU$120k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.30 each. That means that an insider was happy to buy shares at above the current price of AU$0.24. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is generally more encouraging if they paid above the current price, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels.\n\nHappily, we note that in the last year insiders bought 437k shares for a total of AU$130k. Canterbury Resources insiders may have bought shares in the last year, but they didn't sell any. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

Non-Executive Chairman John Ernest Anderson bought AU$10.0k worth of shares in that time. It's great to see that insiders are only buying, not selling. However, in this case the amount invested recently is quite small.\n\nInsider Ownership\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Canterbury Resources insiders own 46% of the company, worth about AU$9.0m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Canterbury Resources Tell Us?\n\nWe note a that there has been a bit of insider buying recently (but no selling).
