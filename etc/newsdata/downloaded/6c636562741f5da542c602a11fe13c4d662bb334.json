But Google also announced a feature that should enhance your security online by telling you which passwords may have been compromised during security breaches targeting various sites, and advising immediate action.\n\nMore from BGR\n\nThe feature is hardly new, and Google Chrome isn\u2019t the only browser that can help you with password security by offering information about past data breaches that may have affected a certain account. But Google will now include the feature in its password manager app. That means, of course, you\u2019d have to use Google\u2019s password manager to save your passwords in order to take advantage of the feature, rather than going for dedicated password managers like 1Password or LastPass.\n\nIn addition to informing you about breaches, the password manager will also prevent you from using bad passwords, like \u201cpassword,\u201d or \u201c123456,\u201d which is something that people are still doing:\n\nToday we\u2019re launching the Password Checkup\u2014a new feature built into our password manager that checks the strength and security of all of your saved passwords, tells you if we find they\u2019ve been compromised (for example, in a breach), and gives you personalized, actionable recommendations when needed.\n\nThe password manager is built-into your Google account, and the Password Checkup feature will tell you whether any of your passwords were compromised. If it determines they were, it will advise you to change the password.\n\nThe tool also tells you if your password is being used on multiple sites \u2014 although that\u2019s something you should already know, because if they are, you\u2019re the one that set them up that way. It\u2019s a good idea not to reuse passwords. You should create strong, unique passwords for each account you have, and then store those passwords inside password managers like Google\u2019s, which is available at this link.\n\nGoogle also says that later this year it will build the Password Checkup technology right into Chrome, so you get real-time protection as you type a password, without the need to install a separate extension.\n\nBGR Top Deals:\n\nTrending Right Now:\n\nSee the original version of this article on BGR.com", "description": "Google on Wednesday announced new tools meant to enhance user privacy across its products, such as Google Maps incognito mode, YouTube history deletion, and privacy management via Google Assistant.
