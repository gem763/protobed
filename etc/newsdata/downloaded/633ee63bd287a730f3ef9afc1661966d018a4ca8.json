Maybe they did do that. Maybe they didn\u2019t but will now. It seems possible that Tom could be the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d that the family patriarch Logan (Brian Cox) says he\u2019ll need to end this scandal. In any case, Tom\u2019s problems fundamentally are created by Tom. He\u2019s a horrible person but also a horrible con man: the kind of guy who, to take one example that made him vulnerable to prosecution, commits harassment by email. \u201cJust remember it is not a courthouse, it is a stage,\u201d Waystar\u2019s strategist Hugo counsels him before the hearing. \u201cAnything goes.\u201d Tom\u2019s useless nib of conscience, his wavering fealty to the big lie, and his undisciplined cowardice ruin the act.\n\nThe actual Roy kids have screwed up for similar reasons before. But in this episode, as Waystar-Royco faced its greatest existential threat, they make a surprising display of mettle\u2014sparring with lawmakers, securing a financial bailout, and neutralizing a whistle-blower. The realm of politics pushes Succession\u2019s kids to grok what Tom doesn\u2019t yet grasp: how great BS works.\n\nLogan, of course, is the master. In private he screams that the scandal over cruises was \u201cnonsense.\u201d At the hearing, he dons his reading glasses and soberly reports that learning of internal malfeasance made for \u201cthe worst day of [his] life,\u201d adding, \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever forgive myself.\u201d He vows a full investigation and thorough prosecution of wrongdoers\u2014and does this so convincingly that Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) whispers \u201cFuck yeah\u201d in the audience. When specific questions come from senators, Logan mumbles, speaks in vagaries, and redirects to his son: a fully committed filibuster.\n\nNext up is Kendall Roy, the troubled and oft-bumbling eldest. The actor Jeremy Strong affects a perfectly blank look throughout Logan\u2019s testimony\u2014which makes it all the more electrifying when Kendall livens up into a cable-news counterpuncher. Back at the Argestes conference earlier in the season, when the cruise scandal was just breaking, he\u2019d insisted that the company take responsibility for its abuses. Now, he aggressively reroutes the hearing\u2019s topic from Warstar-Royco\u2019s wrongdoing to the supposed witch-hunting of the liberal Eavis, who Kendall suggests wanted a state-run media. Kendall\u2019s bluster is as irrelevant to the hearing\u2019s goals as it is advantageous for his own: A hack on the Fox News\u2013like ATN hails it as \u201ca takedown for the ages.\u201d\n\nRoman Roy\u2019s (Kieran Culkin) task: to convince the Azerbaijani heir Edward (Babak Tafti) to sink royal money into Waystar. When Logan puts this assignment to him, Roman calls the ask \u201ca stretch\u201d and offers, \u201cIf it\u2019s really important, I can say I\u2019ll do it, like a fireman in a movie.\u201d Translation: I don\u2019t think I can do it. Yet when pitching Edward\u2019s team in Turkey, Roman puts on a striking display of seriousness and straight talk while outlining the upside of investing in Waystar. Unfortunately the presentation is interrupted by a team of polite kidnappers; fortunately, while being held hostage as part of some sort of sectarian power grab, Roman is still able to move the deal along. The would-be investors ask all the right questions: Might the government block the deal? Might the takeover bid against Waystar interfere? But Roman, so often indecisive and mealymouthed, calmly insists that there\u2019s no need to worry about those things.", "description": "Political scandal backed the Roy family against a wall in the ninth episode of the second season\u2014and they responded by showing their mettle.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/0105ff5871830a19ee4835d726c95622b47f9ab6c0a0f0fc1a7cd7c3549136b77bf81643782ba378a27c8a9e2e095a40/facebook.jpg?1570281445", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
