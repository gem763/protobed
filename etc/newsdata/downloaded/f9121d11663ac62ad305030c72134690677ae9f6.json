And look: I\u2019ve been hurt too many times. The Republicans are definitely the party of rednecks, but Democrats are the party of blue balls.\u201d\n\nThe HBO host dedicated the majority of his opening bit this week to the ongoing Trump-Ukraine whistleblower scandal, wherein the president was called out by a member of the CIA for trying to conduct a quid pro quo with the president of Ukraine in exchange for investigating the son of his political rival: Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cLook, there is a real chance we will know once and for all if Trump did the things he openly admits to doing,\u201d joked Maher. \u201cWell, he did admit it this week. You know, we saw a transcript of the call that\u2019s at the center of this big controversy with the Ukrainian president where he asked a favor of the Ukrainian president, and this raises some serious questions, like: Is there a foreign country that he hasn\u2019t asked to interfere in our elections?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one could be different. People around the president are scared, because they look like they\u2019re complicit,\u201d Maher continued. \u201cI mean, in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint, it says that maybe twelve or more White House staffers listened in on the call, and then some of them helped hide the transcripts of the call in a more private server. Remember that term? Trump\u2019s got treason on his computer like most men have porn.\u201d\n\nThe comic then proceeded to upbraid the most powerful man in the world over his middling (and highly unconvincing) explanations and excuses for the call/transcript in question.\n\n\u201cEvery day he says over and over that the phone call was a \u2018perfect\u2019 call,\u201d says Maher. \u201cMy question is: If it was such a perfect call, why are you behaving like a bed-wetter trying to hurry up and wash the sheets? These people, they are so comically inept at covering up the crimes they are committing. The White House\u2014this is true\u2014wrote two pages of talking points about this, as innocent people do, and sent it out to the Republicans in Congress, but also accidentally sent it to the Democrats. This is the political equivalent of sending a dick pic to your mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd of course, who do they pick as the centerpiece of this? Rudy Giuliani,\u201d added Maher, \u201cwho is not a federal employee\u2014he\u2019s an Uber driver, he\u2019s an independent contractor. He\u2019s at the center of all this, pushing the Biden conspiracy, meeting with the Ukrainians, which explains Rudy\u2019s new nickname: America\u2019s Traitor.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cReal Time\u201d host went off on the former New York mayor over his role in the ongoing drama.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569667238/episode-508-Monologue-1920_uhpxpa", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
