Tottenham\u2019s most effective attacking player has two goals and two assists in four games.\n\nMauricio Pochettino\u2019s side are not in great nick but won impressively on their last outing in north London and find themselves up against a Southampton defence which has shipped nine goals in six games.\n\nAndriy Yarmolenko\n\nYarmolenko is a player we have been watching closely for this column, aware that his modest \u00a35.9m price tag could be a steal if he plays regularly and finds form in an exciting West Ham attack.\n\nHis second goal of the season came against in the 2-0 home victory over Manchester United last weekend, having notched against Norwich at the London Stadium two weeks earlier. Can he now score his first on the road? Bournemouth\u2019s defence can be leaky.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Even better, he will still only set you back \u00a34.6m.\n\nFor all the hype about Leicester\u2019s attacking talents, Brendan Rodgers\u2019s side have looked dependable defensively. Their opponents Newcastle United, meanwhile, only have four goals in six games.\n\nCallum Wilson\n\nBack to the Vitality Stadium and to Wilson, who has ticked over nicely since the opening weekend, with an attacking return in each of his last six games. Three assists have been followed by four goals.\n\nBournemouth can score past any side at home and even though West Ham have recorded three straight clean sheets, we are yet to be fully convinced by Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s defence. This could well be a high-scoring game.\n\nHonourable mentions: Kasper Schmeichel, Serge Aurier, Mason Mount, Erik Lamela, Sebastian Haller.", "description": "Tammy Abraham One of the break-out stars of these first few weeks in a new fantasy season, Abraham has seven goals in six games and is a fine mid-price option up front to partner Norwich City\u2019s Teemu Pukki.
