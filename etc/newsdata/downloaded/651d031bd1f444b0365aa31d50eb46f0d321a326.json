Thanks Extinction Rebellion!'\n\nThe shocking case was brought to light by Adelina Adjei via Twitter, who was accompanying her friend for a cancer procedure on Monday, the first day of the protests that have brought parts of central London to a stand still\n\nMs Adjei filmed protestors on Lambeth Bridge on the first day of the protests on Monday\n\nMs Adjei, a freelance journalist, also posted a video of protestors gathered on Lambeth Bridge, which had been closed off by police, as traffic ground to a halt.

As someone who was very seriously ill last year I don't think my husband would've kept his cool with this utterly disgraceful behaviour. I am sending best wishes and hope your loved one has the good outcome that I did.'\n\nPrior to this week's protest, Extinction Rebellion activists admitted that their actions could disrupt emergency care at hospitals, particularly St Thomas's.\n\nWhen asked on Sky News whether they were worried about disruption at the hospital, activist Savannah Lovelock said that they were 'really sorry\u2026 but we are running out of time'.\n\nActivists have said that they will stand aside to allow ambulances responding to emergencies to pass.", "description": "It was brought to light by Adelina Adjei, who was accompanying her friend for a cancer procedure on Monday, the first day of the protests that have brought parts of central London to a stand still.", "authors": ["Vivek Chaudhary For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/22/19464238-0-image-a-2_1570571713700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
