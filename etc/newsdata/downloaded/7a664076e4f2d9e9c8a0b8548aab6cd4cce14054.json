REUTERS/Luis Cortes\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Mexico City, Slim said he is \u201c100% in agreement\u201d with the goals of leftist Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose economic policies have spooked ratings agencies and investors since his six-year term began in December.\n\nSlim and Lopez Obrador, who have collaborated since the politician\u2019s time as Mexico City mayor in the early 2000s, appeared to be at odds after Lopez Obrador pulled the plug on a $13 billion new airport project in which Slim was heavily involved.\n\nBut Slim, in remarks delivered in the offices of his Grupo Financiero Inbursa, gave no hint of animosity.\n\nAmid calls from Lopez Obrador to improve connectivity in rural Mexico, Slim said his telecom companies have already ratcheted up investment. Telecom investments in the country will total 40 billion pesos ($2.08 billion) per year, Slim said.\n\nSlim\u2019s telecoms giant, America Movil (AMXL.MX), has also been in touch with the governments of Guatemala and El Salvador about boosting investment there, the businessman said.\n\nSlim also offered a glimpse of investments in other parts of his business portfolio, saying he plans to spend 20 billion pesos per year on energy and 12 billion pesos per year on real estate. Infrastructure investments will total more than 100 billion pesos if the company is awarded contracts on the administration\u2019s major projects, he added.\n\nHe singled out the planned Mayan Train, which would connect tourist hotspots in southeastern Mexico, as one attractive target.\n\n\u201cWe will compete, but we don\u2019t know what we will win and what we will lose,\u201d Slim said.\n\nAlthough he predicted that the Mexican economy would not grow this year, Slim was bullish on the investment climate in his home country, predicting that gains in the minimum wage and social aid programs would boost consumption.\n\n\u201cThere is no slowdown, not just for us but for the market,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of projects and lots of money.\u201d\n\nDespite his supportive words for Lopez Obrador, the 79-year-old magnate demurred when asked what grade he would give the politician for the start of his administration.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a rater of presidents,\u201d he quipped.", "description": "Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim said on Wednesday that he expects to invest up to $5 billion in Mexican infrastructure during the current administration as he delivered a full-throated endorsement of the economy despite investor jitters.", "authors": ["Julia Love", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441648129&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F20T", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
