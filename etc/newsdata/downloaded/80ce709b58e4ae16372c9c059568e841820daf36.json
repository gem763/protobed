In the memoir Inside Out, Moore admits that she started drinking again after being sober for more than 20 years, in order to fulfill the role of the \"fun, normal girl\" that she believed Kutcher wanted her to be, and that he \"encouraged\" her to continue drinking.\n\nHowever, she recalls it being extremely \"confusing\" that Kutcher would also shame her for her drinking, recounting an occasion when he tried to embarrass her by taking a photo of her while she was passed out. While celebrating her 45th birthday in Mexico, Moore drank so much that she was \"passing out and slipping under the water,\" and a \"furious\" Kutcher carried her to bed. The next day, though, he showed her a photo he had taken.\n\n\"Ashton had encouraged me to go in this direction,\" she writes. \"When I went too far, though, he let me know how he felt by showing a picture he\u2019d taken of me resting my head on the toilet the night before...It seemed like a good-natured joke at the time. But it was really just shaming.\"\n\nElsewhere in the memoir, Moore writes that the pressure she change herself for Kutcher, to \"show him how great and fun I could be,\" led to her to agreeing to have a threesome. \"I put him first,\" she says. \"So when he expressed his fantasy of bringing a third person into our bed, I didn\u2019t say no. I wanted to show him how great and fun I could be.\" Kutcher would later use this threesome as a justification for cheating on Moore, claiming that it had \"blurred the lines\" of fidelity.\n\nFrom Men's Health\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "The actress opens up about her marriage to Kutcher and struggles with alcohol in her memoir, Inside Out.", "authors": ["Philip Ellis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k3CenPBqKqwYzQhA82SGNw--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_mens_health_171/a094569ebccfa9a5f5f483f1eb61aa91", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
