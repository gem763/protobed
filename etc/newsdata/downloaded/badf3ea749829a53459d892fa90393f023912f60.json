Look at me and look at other females from other ethnic groups, other demographics. I think it\u2019s important to redefine what GOP stands for. And I like to say this is a Grand Opportunity Party.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are desperate to shed the white image, particularly after Democrats fielded a stunningly diverse set of candidates last year that proved to be an antidote to the Trump-fueled GOP. Republicans had a number of female and minority candidates, but they, like Ms. Kim, were defeated.\n\nCombined with retirements, those election losses left House Republicans with a whiter, more male caucus, while Democrats seated more women and ethnic minorities.\n\nThis year hasn\u2019t been much better for Republicans.\n\nThe last remaining black House Republican, Rep. Will Hurd of Texas, announced his retirement, and even the House Republican recruitment chair, Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana, said she will leave Congress next year.\n\nDemocrats found Ms. Brooks\u2019 retirement particularly striking. Rep. Cheri Bustos, the House Democrats\u2019 campaign chair, said Ms. Brooks\u2019 departure was to be expected in a party that \u201ccontinually marginalizes women\u2019s voices.\u201d\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, says it won\u2019t be deterred as it tries to expand its candidate pool.\n\n\u201cChairman Tom Emmer has made it his priority to ensure that our new Republican majority in 2020 will better reflect the makeup of our country. We\u2019re off to a great start with 101 women, 78 veterans and 73 minority candidates already filed to run,\u201d said Chris Pack, communications director at the NRCC.\n\nHe said Republicans have at least 17 minority candidates in 55 districts they are particularly targeting.\n\nThat includes Ms. Kim and her second run in California. In Florida, Republicans are expecting another rematch with journalist Maria Elvira Salazar, who plans to face off again against Rep. Donna Shalala, a Cabinet official under President Clinton who won her House seat in November.\n\nIn Kansas, Sara Hart Weir, a former president of the National Down Syndrome Society, is looking to challenge Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, an American Indian.\n\nOther candidates Republicans are looking to boost include Tina Ramirez, a single mother in Virginia who is set to take on Rep. Abigail Spanberger; Wesley Hunt, who is running in Texas; Mike Garcia in California; and Charles Narravo, who is seeking the Republican nomination for a seat from Nevada. Another Republican in Nevada\u2019s 4th District race is Lisa Song Sutton, a former Miss Nevada USA, whose mother is a Korean immigrant.\n\nRepublican strategist Jim McLaughlin said women make particularly good candidates for Republicans because they are often outsiders who don\u2019t match the party\u2019s \u201cgood old boys in Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for people that don\u2019t have voting records. That don\u2019t have a lot of government experience. Folks that don\u2019t look and sound like the status quo,\u201d he told The Times.\n\nMr. McLaughlin said one of Republicans\u2019 best tools to ramp up recruitment is their fight against socialism, which they say Democrats will usher in if they succeed in the 2020 elections.\n\nRNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters that a fight against socialism is helping Republicans win over college-educated women, particularly in suburban districts. Weighing the risk of losing private health care and the potential effects on the economy, Ms. McDaniel argued, is helping \u201cmove them back\u201d to supporting Republican candidates.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer, NRCC chairman, explained in a Fox News op-ed in June that the Republican strategy would be to explain to voters why socialism is bad, not just framing it as a fight against a vague \u201cOther.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless we make it clear to voters why these policies are a bad deal for them, we are at risk of losing even more Republican seats in 2020,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMs. Salazar plans to do just that in her Florida race.\n\nShe told The Times that her family\u2019s story \u2014 fleeing from Cuba after the rise of communist dictator Fidel Castro \u2014 has given her a personal understanding about the impacts of socialist policies.\n\n\u201cI think that as Cuban Americans we can attest and explain to the rest of the country what socialism means and that there\u2019s nothing pretty about democratic socialism,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s just a pretty word in front of an ugly one.\u201d\n\nShe and Ms. Kim will likely face questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration rhetoric, which his critics say is anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic.\n\n\u201cTrump has not picked the right words in many occasions, but he has picked the right policies,\u201d Ms. Salazar said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just been a miscommunication at the GOP we need to do a better job in sending that message or communicating that we are just like the Latino community. That\u2019s why they came here as immigrants: to work hard, to pay taxes and to love the country,\u201d she added.\n\nThe Republican focus on identity politics is perhaps an odd fit for a party that has traditionally criticized the practice.\n\nKyle Kondik, an analyst at Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball, an elections forecasting operation, wasn\u2019t sure how much Republican voters will respond.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean Republican voters are sexist or racists; it just may mean that voting for someone based on their demographic attributes isn\u2019t something that they value. Or they don\u2019t value it as much as Democrats might,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said one way to gauge Republicans\u2019 optimism about their chances to win back the House is to look at former members considering another run. One of them is David Valadao, who held his California seat for three terms before losing last year but is eyeing a comeback.\n\n\u201cSometimes retirements can sometimes give us a sense as to how confident those members may be about retaking the majority,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, if you look at the retirements as a pessimistic sign, you also have to look at the former members running as a more optimistic argument.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
