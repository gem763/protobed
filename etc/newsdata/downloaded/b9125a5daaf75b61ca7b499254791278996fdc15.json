We just wanted to go on holiday.\n\n'Things first kicked off when the group at the back got into a fight. Punches were thrown, and the stewardess broke them up.\n\n'But then they kicked off again, and passengers actually intervened to calm them down.\n\n'One woman got in the way, but a guy spat in her eye. It was disgusting.\n\nHe described how after cabin crew diverted to Portugal 'things escalated' and the stag party 'howled with rage'.\n\n'One of the guys got into trouble when he started pinching drinks from the front of the plane. It was Bedlam,' Nathan said.\n\nHe continued: 'Once we landed, though, security got them off. It was impressive - one of the guys they had to carry off was at least six-foot-six.'\n\nJet2 confirmed a row between passengers had erupted, saying: 'As a family friendly airline we will not tolerate disruptive behaviour of any sort.\n\n'As such we will always take the appropriate action to ensure that our passengers and staff do not have to endure the unacceptable actions of a small minority.\n\n'We take this matter very seriously and we are liaising with the relevant authorities.'", "description": "Seven British passengers were escorted off a Jet2 flight travelling from Manchester to Tenerife.
