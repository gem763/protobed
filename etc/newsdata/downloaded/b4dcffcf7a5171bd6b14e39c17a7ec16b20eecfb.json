Here are some simple tricks on how to ask for a pay rise.\n\nAustralia Post boss Christine Holgate has been revealed as the country\u2019s highest paid civil servant, earning more than $2.5 million in 2018/19.\n\nHer wage was up from $1.646 million after being bolstered by $300,000 in extra bonuses and $224,500 in other long-term benefits, according to government documents reported by The Australian Financial Review.\n\nThe eye-watering figure does, however, pale in comparison to her predecessor Ahmed Fahour whose $6.8 million salary sparked widespread condemnation and led to former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull admitting \u201cthat remuneration is too high\u201d.\n\nRELATED: Telstra chair compares $5m salary to kids playing Fortnite\n\nRELATED: RBA boss blasts CEO salaries after Qantas boss\u2019s wage revealed\n\nABC managing director David Anderson earned $1.4 million in the financial year from a base salary of $799,136 and long-service leave benefits of $265,933, while SBS boss James Taylor received total remuneration of $809,113.\n\nThe treasure trove of information also revealed 94 executives at the National Disability Insurance Agency were paid a combined $23 million with its minister Stuart Robert defending the wages, saying the organisation needed \u201can extraordinary group of executives\u201d, according to The Courier Mail.\n\nThe NDIA\u2019s previous CEO Robert De Luca, who was replaced yesterday by Martin Hoffman, had a base salary of $566,000, higher than the Prime Minister\u2019s $538,000.\n\nThe revelations come after the Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe last month blasted the extraordinary salaries of the country\u2019s CEOs following Qantas boss Alan Joyce pocketing a staggering $24 million last year.\n\nDr Lowe compared the absurd bonuses among the business community\u2019s elite with the stagnant wage growth of regular Australians, which he said should be raised by more than 3 per cent.\n\n\u201cAs a regular Australian, it disturbs me,\u201d he said during a speech to the Armidale Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cSome people who are paid extraordinarily high amounts of money and working Australians have relatively low wages and getting small wage increases, I think it\u2019s an issue for society.\u201d\n\nThe RBA boss, who manages a national balance sheet of $182 billion, received a total wage of $1.059 million in the financial year and said he rejected the chance of a performance-based salary structure.\n\nHe said CEOs shouldn\u2019t be rewarded with an incentive for doing their job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a flat salary and I say to my board, \u2018Look, don\u2019t consider performance because you know I\u2019m going to work as hard for you and for the people who show up regardless\u2019. Actually, I think a lot of people are like that,\u201d the RBA boss said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the incentives. My incentive is to do a good job for the people.\u201d\n\nAlan Joyce\u2019s $23,876,351 wage was the most of any Australian CEO in the 2018 financial year, according to analysis from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI).\n\nMacquarie Group CEO Nicholas Moore came second with a $23.86 million pay packet, while Michael Clarke from Treasury Wine Estates made $19,024,334.\n\nThe median pay enjoyed by ASX 100 CEOs was $4.5 million \u2014 a far cry from the country\u2019s average full-time wage, which the Australian Bureau of Statistics places at $85,010.\n\nThe median bonus was $1.61 million, the second highest figure in the survey\u2019s 18-year history, while 10 CEOs took home more than $10m in FY18.\n\nOn Tuesday, Telstra chairman John Mullen launched an extraordinary defence of the millions of dollars paid to executives at the telco and other Australia companies, saying Instagram influencers and computer gamers pocket a similar amount.\n\nLast year Telstra was one of many publicly listed companies to come under the spotlight of excessive bonuses paid to executives, with shareholders rejecting its remuneration report.\n\nBut the major telco avoided a second strike this week on payments despite chief executive Andy Penn pocketing $5 million for the year.\n\nDuring the AGM, Mr Mullen vented his frustration at the backlash, saying he struggles to understand why the business community is singled out over the cash splash.\n\nThe chairman\u2019s comments come after a Melbourne teen won $4.6 million in August at a Dota 2 esports gaming event.\n\n\u201cYoung kids can earn $US5 million now by playing Fortnite. And even influencers \u2014 you can earn millions of dollars just by wearing a nice jacket and standing in front of a landmark,\u201d Mr Mullen said.\n\n\u201cAnd yet when a business executive devotes a huge portion of their life \u2014 they work long, long hours, weekends, they miss family events \u2014 when they get to the top of their profession, it is somehow morally wrong that they get rewarded for it in an international global market.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) secretary Sally McManus slammed the defence of the pay, tweeting business executives \u201clive in another world to us\u201d.\n\n\u201cExtreme wealth from obscene bonuses seems to make them totally blind to inequality and the lives of everyone else,\u201d she said.\n\nAre salaries of civil servants and business executives in Australia too high?
