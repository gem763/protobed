And apparently one of his former assistants helped give him one Sunday.\n\nKeen observers of the Patriots' 43-0 rout of the Miami Dolphins at Hard Rock Stadium may have noticed a handful of makeshift tents on New England's sideline under which players could find relief from the South Florida heat.\n\nSunny on the visitor sideline here.

In training camp we were out there and talked about it a little bit, so I felt like it would be something worth trying, and we did during the game.\"\n\nThe temperature at kickoff was 87 degrees, but the heat index rose into the 100s thanks to 67 percent humidity, prompting quarterback Tom Brady to declare Sunday's game one of the hottest he's ever played in.\n\n\"That was as hot a game as I can remember,\" Brady said Monday on WEEI's \"The Greg Hill Show.\" \" ... That was pretty intense.\"\n\nThat's a pretty bold claim considering Brady visited Miami once a year for the past two decades. But Belichick backed his quarterback's \"hot\" take.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I would agree with Tom's assessment,\" Belichick told reporters. \"I can't remember being in a hotter game than that. Sometimes what the temperature is and how it feels are two different things. It was a very challenging heat.\"\n\nBrady and the Patriots kept their cool, though: Brady completed 20 of 28 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns while New England's defense absolutely erased Miami's offense.\n\nHow much those tents played a role in the Patriots' domination is up for debate, but in any case, they were much better prepared for the Dolphins than the last time they visited Miami Gardens.\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!
