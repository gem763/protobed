Now you can finally hear the completed version.", "language": "en", "text": "Now he was 50, battling diabetes and heart disease, and it had been more than a decade since his last album. Mark Hudson, who had been working with Nilsson on these new songs, went to the meeting.\n\n\u201cAnd I begged Harry, \u2018When I get in there, let me be Fred Astaire and do the tap dancing,\u2019 \u201d Hudson says. \u201cAnd Harry, he spoke his mind. We went in there and played them like three of the demos, and I could see it in their faces, and Harry goes, \u2018You guys don\u2019t get it, do you?\u2019 I said, \u2018Harry, music has changed a little bit.\u2019 And he said, \u2018Change this,\u2019 and got up and walked out.\u201d\n\nNilsson would be gone for good two years later, suffering a fatal heart attack on Jan. 15, 1994. And the demos would languish for decades, existing as rumors chatted about on fan sites or occasionally shared as bootlegs. But on Nov. 22, Omnivore Recordings will release \u201cLosst and Founnd,\u201d which features Nilsson\u2019s final recordings with a production polish by Hudson and some of the late singer\u2019s friends, including Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and drummer Jim Keltner. Kiefo Nilsson, who was 8 when his father died, added bass to the album.\n\n\u201cLosst and Founnd\u201d is not Harry Nilsson\u2019s greatest work, but it\u2019s a fitting coda for one of music\u2019s most original characters. When he emerged in the late \u201960s, Nilsson had a gorgeous tenor that stretched across three and a half octaves, a wry sense of humor and a deep respect for the studio. He seemed capable of pulling off anything: a sublime tribute to his desk, an entire record of Randy Newman covers or standards performed with a full orchestra. His songs were often so cinematic in scope, it\u2019s no wonder his catalogue became a favorite of film and television directors, whether punctuating drug paranoia in \u201cGoodfellas\u201d (\u201cJump Into the Fire\u201d) or, earlier this year, the darkly comic reset in Natasha Lyonne\u2019s \u201cRussian Doll\u201d (\u201cGotta Get Up\u201d).\n\nThough he never played live, Nilsson was once famous. John Lennon, in a late \u201960s news conference, declared that \u201cNilsson\u2019s my favorite group.\u201d And it would be Lennon who produced Nilsson\u2019s 1974 album \u201cPussy Cats,\u201d during which the singer strained his voice to the point he was coughing up blood. \u201cPussy Cats\u201d would be his last album to crack the Top 100. He put out his final studio album, \u201cFlash Harry,\u201d in 1980, but it was not even released in the United States.\n\nNilsson spent the last decade of his life recording an occasional song for a soundtrack, dabbling in film production and fighting for gun control. He had been crushed by Lennon\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI think he abandoned songs and thought they were trivial,\u201d Parks says. \u201cThen, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, he called me asking me to work. It was about 10:30 at night. I told him, \u2018Harry, I won\u2019t work late at night anymore.\u2019 Then he worked surreptitiously with Mark on this album. He didn\u2019t make any big pronouncements on it.\u201d\n\nHudson, who would go on to co-write Aerosmith\u2019s \u201cLivin\u2019 on the Edge\u201d and produce Ringo Starr, started working with Nilsson in the 1980s.\n\nIn 1986, they recorded a demo of \u201cTry.\u201d They did \u201cLosst and Founnd\u2019s\u201d title track on a four-track Tascam in 1987. Nilsson sang the vocals of \u201cHi-Heel Sneakers/Rescue Boy Medley\u201d just two days before he died. Four other songs were recorded in Chicago in 1989, including what may be the emotional centerpiece of the new album, \u201cU.C.L.A.,\u201d a grooving ballad that manages to blend melancholy, hopefulness and, like the best of Nilsson\u2019s writing, wit and wordplay. Who else rhymes \u201coyster bar\u201d with \u201cRingo Starr\u201d?\n\n\u201cThe lyric is a tour de force in terms of pun,\u201d Parks says. \u201cThe power of deception. The ultimate joy of each ball lobbed over the net that\u2019s an incredible triumph of each thought because they\u2019re all understandable inventions. And I\u2019m absolutely delighted that it reveals his unerring falsetto.\u201d\n\nNilsson family attorney Lee Blackman said that he and Una, the singer\u2019s widow, had been trying to put out the Hudson tapes for years but could never work out the right deal. Then, he began talking to Omnivore, a boutique label that has released everything from the Beach Boys to Buck Owens and NRBQ in recent years. Brad Rosenberger, one of the company\u2019s owners, was a huge fan and, in his previous job at Warner/Chappell publishing, had engineered deals to place Nilsson songs in such films as \u201cMagnolia\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d Rosenberger and Blackman then tracked down Hudson, who had one demand.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to let you put it out in the shape it\u2019s in,\u2019 \u201d Hudson says. \u201cIt just was Harry and I in the room with him chain-smoking and me playing every instrument. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll do it for nothing. I\u2019ll do it in my studio. I\u2019ll call all my friends.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJimmy Webb came to play piano on the album closer, his \u201cWhat Does a Woman See In a Man.\u201d Nilsson sang it at a friend\u2019s house one night in 1993. Only the vocal was salvaged. Keltner, whose first session with Nilsson had taken place 48 years ago on \u201cWithout You,\u201d came in to add drums.\n\n\u201cAnd Mark said, \u2018Do you have a favorite bass player?\u2019 \u201d Keltner remembers.\n\nKeltner had just met Kiefo Nilsson at a wedding and learned that he played bass.\n\n\u201cAnd he looked kind of like Harry,\u201d Keltner says. \u201cTall and sandy-haired. I said, \u2018Mark, you\u2019ve got to call him.\u2019 Thank goodness Mark is one of those guys who isn\u2019t unbendable.\u201d\n\nKiefo, 34, says he didn\u2019t choke up during the recording. He played as he might at any session. He knows some fans may have grown attached to the bootlegged demos. But he was pleased when he and his mother, Una, sat and listened to the completed album in her living room this year.\n\n\u201cThis is a good representation of what my dad was doing and where his artistry was at this point,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to sound like a George Tipton record from the \u201960s, but you still want to convey the sense of humor and wit and elegance to the songwriting. That\u2019s what he leaves behind.\u201d\n\nWhat pushed Graham Nash, the quiet one, to record his solo masterpiece\n\nThe summer of 1969: When Elvis made his true comeback\n\nA jazz legend said he was in desperate need of money.
