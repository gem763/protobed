It\u2019s qualifying and you go for it. If they want to delete the lap, then delete the lap.\u201d\n\nHe was found to have ignored yellow flags during qualifying at the 2018 Russian Grand Prix where he was handed a three-place grid penalty.\n\nIf he is handed a similar penalty by the Mexican stewards, it could lift defending five-time champion Hamilton up the grid after qualifying fourth -\u2013 potentially boosting his hopes of clinching his sixth world title on Sunday.\n\nBottas\u2019s heavy accident left his car severely damaged and likely to require new parts that may also result in grid penalties, possibly forcing him to start from the back of the grid or from the pit lane.\n\nHamilton can seal his sixth title on Sunday if he finishes on the podium and outscores Bottas by at least 14 points.", "description": "Mexico City (AFP) \u2013 Max Verstappen was summoned to see the stewards at the Mexican Grand Prix on Saturday after telling a news conference that he", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/9bf64d_max-verstappen-celebrates-pole-in-mexico-but-was-summoned-stewards-pole-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
