It looks like the DOJ has finally decided to hold someone accountable for what went on during the Hillary-Trump investigative fiasco.\n\nFormer FBI Assistant Director and current CNN talking head, Andrew McCabe, failed to convince the DOJ not to move forward with prosecution against him after a last ditch effort to change their minds. This report is coming via Fox News. The Daily Caller\u2019s Chuck Ross, who\u2019s been killer on this beat, also confirms this story is accurate.\n\nSource close to McCabe tells me this Fox News report is accurate (not that I doubted it). https://t.co/U5xCpI8tFt \u2014 Chuck Ross (@ChuckRossDC) September 12, 2019\n\nU.S. Attorney Jessie Liu has recommended moving forward with charges against Andrew McCabe, Fox News has learned, as the Justice Department rejects a last-ditch appeal from the former top FBI official. McCabe \u2014 the former deputy and acting director of the FBI \u2014 appealed the decision of the U.S. attorney for Washington all the way up to Jeffrey Rosen, the deputy attorney general, but he rejected that request, according to a person familiar with the situation. The potential charges relate to DOJ inspector general findings against him regarding misleading statements concerning a Hillary Clinton-related investigation. A source close to McCabe\u2019s legal team said they received an email from the Department of Justice which said, \u201cThe Department rejected your appeal of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s decision in this matter. Any further inquiries should be directed to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d\n\nThis comes in response to the Inspector General finding that McCabe had lacked candor (i.e. lied) to the FBI multiple times involving leaks to the press.\n\nThere\u2019s also the factor of McCabe suing the FBI last month that plays into this. Perhaps McCabe\u2019s arrogance wrote a check his butt can\u2019t cash? Trying to sue when he was clearly fired for just cause likely only emboldened the U.S. Attorney to press forward with prosecution.\n\nWe can\u2019t mention McCabe without talking about CNN either. Despite the IG report and all the facts known about McCabe, CNN hired him on as an \u201canalyst\u201d last month in a widely mocked move. Is there any wonder that network is cratering in the ratings and has lost all credibly?\n\nCNN announced 20 days ago it was hiring McCabe as a contributor amid the ongoing criminal leak investigation into him. The network is now on air confirming reports that he will likely be indicted. https://t.co/eJGD8QjX5K pic.twitter.com/5pZ85utCVA \u2014 Alex Mallin (@alex_mallin) September 12, 2019\n\nDrink the schadenfreude in.\n\nSpecial Agent Andrew McCabe stood tall over the last 8 months, when small people were trying to tear down an institution we all depend on. He served with distinction for two decades. I wish Andy well. I also wish continued strength for the rest of the FBI. America needs you. \u2014 James Comey (@Comey) January 30, 2018\n\nThey are weepiing for their man-god https://t.co/zjXvKGilB4 \u2014 streiff (@streiffredstate) September 12, 2019\n\nThis is the beginnings of what justice looks like. After every single Trump lackey who looked at an FBI agent the wrong way was charged during the Mueller saga, it would have been untenable for the DOJ to then look the other way at their own committing the same crime.\n\nWhile this certainly won\u2019t gain back the trust these institutions have lost, it\u2019s a start in the process. Bill Barr is doing things the right way and if the indicators we are seeing tell the story, he\u2019s not done yet. More prosecutions are coming.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a lot of new flop sweat building among people who thought they were in the clear.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEnjoying the read?
