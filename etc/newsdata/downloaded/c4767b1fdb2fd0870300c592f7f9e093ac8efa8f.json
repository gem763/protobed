Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was posted on Friday and later deleted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to concentrate on playing in Japan, playing great games and enjoying the culture of Japan,\u201d he said as the club prepares for two exhibition games against the NBA champion Toronto Raptors in Saitama City.\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) reacted furiously to the comments, saying it would sever all ties with the Rockets, despite the club\u2019s owner stating in a tweet of his own that Morey did not speak for the club.\n\n\u201cGeneral manager of Houston Rockets club Daryl Morey made incorrect comments about Hong Kong,\u201d the CBA said on its official social media page on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese Basketball Association is strongly opposed to this and will suspend communication and cooperation with the club.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, club owner Tilman Fertitta wrote on Twitter: \u201cListen\u2026. @dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d\n\nIn a later interview with ESPN in Japan, Fertitta insisted that his relationship with Morey remained strong.\n\n\u201cI have the best general manager in the league,\u201d Fertitta told ESPN.\n\n\u201cEverything is fine with Daryl and me. We got a huge backlash, and I wanted to make clear that (the organization) has no (political) position. We\u2019re here (in Asia) to play basketball and not to offend anybody.\u201d\n\nSemi-autonomous Hong Kong has been battered by four months of increasingly violent pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe rallies were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to mainland China, fuelling fears of an erosion of liberties in Hong Kong under the 50-year \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model China agreed before the 1997 handover from Britain.\n\nThe Rockets have enjoyed a huge following in China since the club drafted Chinese star Yao Ming in 2002.\n\nThe towering centre averaged 19 points and 9.2 rebounds in eight seasons with the team and became president of the Chinese Basketball Association in 2017.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 The Houston Rockets tried Sunday to distance the NBA club, who have a huge Chinese fan base, from general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/06/56441c_houston-rockets-manager-daryl-morey-pictured-in-2015-in-deleted-tweet-stand-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
