Andrew Cuomo signed a law authorizing the creation of a license plate honoring the famed Jamaican bobsled team that qualified for the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary and inspired the Disney film, \"Cool Runnings.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut those plans have since been put on hold, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles. It's a symbolic blow both to New York\u2019s sizable Jamaican community and to the memory of a team determined to be thought of as more than an athletic non-sequitur.\n\nAnd it adds a minor chapter to New York\u2019s annals of license plate-based imbroglios.\n\nThe man who has piloted the run for the license plate, Devon Harris \u2014 a member of the team and the chairman of the Jamaican Bobsled Foundation \u2014 told POLITICO that the root of the problem is the $25 plate fee.\n\nHarris said the impetus for the plate was not simply to honor the sledders of 1988, but to serve as an additional revenue stream for the chronically underfunded team going forward. The law, however, directs the money to the state\u2019s general fund.\n\n\u201cWe demonstrated that we do have the athletic talent to do really well, but our Achilles heel is not that we're from Jamaica \u2014 a warm tropical paradise \u2014 but because we don\u2019t have enough funding,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris said a commemorative license plate \u201cwould be a great testament to what we did in 1988,\u201d but that the true goal is \u201cdeveloping a new generation of Jamaican bobsledders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still expect and hope that one day we have the license plates on cars, but that it will support the team in a meaningful way and not just a symbolic gesture.\u201d\n\nThe plate never went far in the design and development stage, and Harris did not procure the necessary financing for the $6,000 surety bond that would have been needed before it would have gone into production.\n\nIt was the first time that team supporters have attempted such a non-traditional fundraising vehicle, according to Harris, adding that he plans to reconnect with local political officials to take a second crack at it.\n\n\"I don\u2019t understand the rhythm of politics in Albany,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThere\u2019s been some radio silence; we need to make a move on our end.\u201d\n\nIt may be considerably more difficult to persuade state lawmakers that the license plate is more than just a lark, especially if the revenue would go toward supporting another country\u2019s athletic team.\n\nThe bobsled saga is playing out as the Cuomo administration moves forward with creating a new license plate design and requiring that car owners with plates older than 10 years pay to obtain the yet-to-be-finalized new plate.\n\nCritics have called it a money grab by Cuomo, and conspiracy theorists have wondered whether a competition to choose the plate's design was rigged to favor a design featuring the replacement to the Tappan Zee Bridge, which is named after the governor's father, the late Gov. Mario Cuomo.\n\nBut that\u2019s not even the first headline-grabbing license plate issue in recent years. In 2015 a federal appeals court ruled that New York was allowed to prevent the creation of a custom plate with the phrase \u201cChoose Life.\"\n\nThe case gained attention for its First Amendment implications, namely the ability of states to exclude potentially sensitive or politically charged messages from license plates. The lawsuit actually predated Cuomo's tenure.", "description": "Supporters hoped revenue would support the program.", "authors": ["Nick Niedzwiadek"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cc/30/ee1b49104a29ba72170fe4a2a9e4/jamaican-bobsled-team-900.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
