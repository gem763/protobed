The new pair comes in the \"true wireless\" form factor popularized by Apple's AirPods, with two small earbuds that connect to a source device without any cables running between them.\n\nThe new earbuds are a successor to the Pixel Buds Google released in 2017, which had a more traditional wireless headphone design and received generally middling feedback at launch . These new earbuds keep the same name and sport a similarly rounded shape, but have a slightly redesigned \"arc\" that keeps them in place and eartips that look to create a tighter seal. There's a vent on the bottom of each earbud designed to let in external noise and avoid blocking out the outside world completely, though.\n\nGoogle says the new Pixel Buds will get five hours of battery life on a charge, with up to 24 hours added through its charging case. That's about in line with the AirPods, but a good ways behind class leaders like Beats' Powerbeats Pro earphones, which get closer to 9-10 hours on their own. The company also touts \"long-range Bluetooth connectivity\" that grants it enough range to work \"three rooms away indoors or a football field-distance away outdoors,\" though it didn't go into any specifics regarding how it's achieved that. (We'd guess it's using Class 1 Bluetooth.) Google says the new Pixel Buds are sweat- and water-resistant as well, though it didn't provide a specific IPX rating.\n\nThe case itself is small and egg-shaped, and there are two microphones in each earbud to help with call clarity. Like the previous Pixel Buds, these are intended to be \"smart\" headphones, and as such you get hands-free Google Assistant support. There's no active noise cancellation, but there is an \"adaptive sound\" feature designed to adjust the volume of whatever you're playing dynamically, depending on the noise levels of your surrounding environment.\n\nThe new Pixel Buds will cost $179 and arrive sometime next Spring. Google says it'll detail the new earbuds more in the coming months. Either way, it's jumping back into an increasingly crowded wireless headphone market, joining fellow tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft in addition to usual headphone makers like Sony, Beats, Jaybird and the like.\n\nThis post is developing and Google's event is ongoing.
