I have been unsuccessful for 20 years.\u201d In today\u2019s therapy session, Annie and Mau are talking about Annie\u2019s repeated failures to satisfy Mau on his birthday, just one example of his disappointment with her inability to anticipate his needs.\n\nAs Annie describes her painstaking attempt to plan a special weekend full of \u201csexual events,\u201d including a dominatrix theme and a threesome, her husband of 23 years looks around impatiently, each fleeting facial expression seemingly conveying his disagreement with her statements. \u201cThe things she was doing,\u201d Mau explains when it is his turn to speak, \u201c[are] the things she could only imagine I would want if she never was paying attention.\u201d\n\nOpposite the sofa, charged with helping the partners work out their sexy birthday party woes is Dr. Orna Guralnik, a New York City-based clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst. Guralnik\u2019s brunette ponytail is in the foreground of these opening shots as she listens attentively to her clients. The framing, with the therapist\u2019s back to the camera and the audience seeing what she sees, invites us to step into Guralnik\u2019s shoes.\n\nThe soft-spoken Guralnik has her work cut out for her. In the same conversation, Mau frustratedly declares that he is the easiest person in the world to please. A few beats later, he says, \u201cWhat I want is to have zero responsibility, to have all the sex I want without any work on my part of any kind. Like zero work, zero thinking about it and it has to be both spectacular and enthusiastic, and genuine.\u201d\n\nThese are the kinds of unfiltered, sincere exchanges that make Couples Therapy so fascinating. Sometimes you are tempted to laugh at the show\u2019s participants, as in the above example, but then you realize that these are just normal people exposing their most intimate thoughts. Who hasn\u2019t, at some point, sought the release of venting one\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cterrible\u201d desires?\n\nCouples Therapy, which follows four couples\u2019 therapy sessions with Dr. Guralnik over the course of 20 weeks, allows viewers to experience this catharsis in close proximity, tracking every tear, sigh, and fidget. The series comes from Edgeline Films\u2014the same production company that produced the Sundance-prize-winning Anthony Weiner doc, Weiner\u2014and it\u2019s often as juicy as reality TV. Yet it somehow manages to feel completely real.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty astonishing both to myself and, I think, to everyone who participated,\u201d Guralnik tells The Daily Beast. \u201cBut it just felt like the work took over and the fact that it was filmed, it doesn\u2019t matter. The conversation is happening, and all the cameras and production immediately recede, and the real work happens.\u201d\n\nStill, the presence of a camera crew and the promise of broadcasting a couple\u2019s most private moments to millions of viewers is undeniably counterintuitive to the expectations of therapy. Though Guralnik insisted that the atypical circumstances surprisingly had little impact on her approach to her job, she says, \u201cOften in couples\u2019 therapy you talk a lot about sex, or you talk way more explicitly about certain things, like money. I think maybe I, as a therapist, held back a little bit and didn\u2019t go to the most exposing aspects. But it was very minor, that kind of restraint.\u201d\n\n\u201c What I want is to have zero responsibility, to have all the sex I want without any work on my part of any kind. \u201d\n\nGuralnik, a graduate of the NYU Postdoctoral Program in Psychoanalysis, had reservations about doing the show. In fact, she initially planned only to offer her expertise as a consultant, but she was compelled to audition for the analyst role at the urging of a colleague. One of the main draws, she says, was the opportunity to correct what she believed to be inaccurate portrayals of therapists in mainstream media. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of negative and paranoid projections onto analysts,\u201d she explains, \u201cand I was thinking, \u2018These guys seem like they actually want to portray the real work, which would be awesome.\u2019\u201d\n\nThough the fraught dynamics dissected in Couples Therapy are often specific to the couples involved, Guralnik is able to pinpoint a few common issues in relationships. She says that couples often have two or three issues they keep coming back to, defined in psychoanalytic terms as \u201crepetition compulsion.\u201d \u201cWe get stuck in certain patterns and we don\u2019t know how to do things any differently,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe see things a certain way, and then we keep doing the same thing, and we don\u2019t understand why it keeps feeling bad.\u201d\n\nAnother frequent problem? Something she calls \u201cthe blame game,\u201d or the idea that any bad feelings a person is experiencing must be a result of someone else\u2019s actions. With a laugh, she admits that even she is sometimes guilty of playing the blame game. \u201cI mean, we all do that,\u201d she concedes. \u201cI lose my keys and I\u2019m like, \u2018Who put [them] somewhere?\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nLikewise, she has some basic relationship advice to offer the show\u2019s viewers, free of charge: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of the truth.\u201d According to the relationship expert, maintaining a healthy love life really can be as simple as adhering to the \u201chonesty is the best policy\u201d mantra plastered on the walls of elementary school classrooms. \u201cPeople are afraid of the truth and they don\u2019t trust themselves, and they don\u2019t trust other people and their capacity to handle truth,\u201d Guralnik says. \u201cPeople actually do much better with the truth than with dancing around it.\u201d\n\nThe nine-episode first season of Couples Therapy premieres Friday, Sept. 6 at 10 p.m. on Showtime.", "description": "On the juicy new docuseries, Dr. Orna Guralnik goes deep into the domestic struggles and \u2018terrible\u2019 sexual desires of New York City couples.", "authors": ["Jordan Julian"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567734475/190904-couples-therapy-tease_mdzv8q", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
