Damien Cooley had been the auctioneer and there\u2019d been two registered parties, but neither bid.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHorizon penthouse passes in on $16m vendor bid\n\nInside the $20m Horizon penthouse\n\nIt\u2019s understood she\u2019s paid about $16 million for the five-bedroom, five-bathroom apartment with an eight-car garage,\n\nThe Knight Frank lead agent, Adam Ross, with colleague Oliver Stillman, confirmed to the Wentworth Courier this morning only that the property had sold.\n\nMORE: Macquarie exec lists Dover Heights dream home\n\nHeidi Onisforou\u2019s Potts Point buyer revealed\n\nBut bound by a confidentiality agreement, he certainly wasn\u2019t providing any information on the buyer or even the final price.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that the campaign drew domestic and international interest and the ultimate party was one of our original seven contract holders,\u201d Mr Ross said.\n\nHe also confirmed that the buyer was a local.\n\nHowever, five days is a long time in top-end eastern suburbs property circles \u2014 especially one involving a Packer, who is incredibly excited about her purchase.\n\nShe told Nine Media gossip columnist Andrew Hornery that she was \u201cback to see my mamma\u201d when he ran into her in Paddington last Monday. But she also had a significant property purchase on her mind.\n\nThe Wentworth Courier understands that Ms Packer-Barham had in fact tried to purchase the penthouse \u2014 the biggest single-level apartment in Sydney with 565 sqm of internal space and 710 sqm when the balconies and garage are included \u2014 last Friday ahead of the auction.\n\nShe\u2019d made an offer of $15.5 million, but the vendors, the Melbourne-based Graham family, had opted to proceed with the auction.\n\nThe guide had been $16.5 million.\n\nIf it had sold at auction, it would have easily been the most expensive apartment sold at auction.\n\nThis certainly isn\u2019t a first home for the 25-year-old. Ms Packer Barham sold her investment property in Melbourne\u2019s South Yarra for $7.6 million in 2017 before heading back to London to complete her final year of design school.\n\nThe daughter of billionaire Gretel \u00adPacker and English financier Nicholas Barham had bought it for $6,125,000 in 2015 when she was dating a Melbourne property developer.\n\nShe also owns a two-bedroom apartment in the Encore building in Elizabeth Bay that she bought for $2.1 million in 2016.\n\nEarlier this year, Gretel Packer had offered more than $22m to buy two neighbouring penthouses to create a super penthouse atop Potts Point\u2019s Omnia building, but missed out.\n\nRELATED:\n\nGretel Packer\u2019s $22m+ offer\n\nGretel Packer bought the Macleay Regis penthouse for $8.75 million at auction two years ago, though she resides in the Edwardian home \u2018Winston\u2019 in Bellevue Hill, next door to the Rona estate, that she bought in 2000 for $11.25m.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see why Ms Packer-Barham, who is keen to be an interior designer, would be impressed with the apartment fit-out.\n\nThe incredible property was redesigned by Melbourne-based Mim Design before it hit the market in February with a $20 million price guide in an expression of interest campaign.\n\nAt the time, the Wentworth Courier was given exclusive access to the property, with Mr Ross pointing out \u201cIt\u2019s the only brand new whole-floor apartment at this price point.\u201d\n\nAlthough there was considerable interest, it\u2019s taken an auction campaign to get the sale across the line.\n\nThe Grahams had bought the Horizon empty shell across two titles for $9.83 million a year ago.\n\nMim Design says their vision was to pay homage to Harry Seidler (he designed the famous tower) with \u201casymmetric curving\u201d.\n\nThey also wanted to establish clear lines of vision to the harbour and city views.\n\nThere\u2019s cote d\u2019azure marble, French oak herringbone parquetry, designer lighting and bespoke joinery with leather accents.\n\nDeveloper Bob Ell once owned it. It was always expected to sell to a jetsetting couple or even a wealthy eastern suburbs family. But it will certainly make an impressive Sydney base for Ms Packer-Barham and the Packer family.\n\nThe eldest grandchild of Kerry Packer has been spending considerable time at the Packer family\u2019s luxury property Ellerston in the Hunter Valley of late.\n\nRELATED:\n\nPoint Piper home with $60m price guide set for auction\n\nMr Cooley is also the auctioneer for a Point Piper house at 1 Wingadal Pl, which is set to go to auction on November 23 and could break the auction record.\n\nHe is the same auctioneer who set the current auction record of $23 million in 2009 when Bellevue Hill\u2019s grand Georgian house Le Manoir sold to Lachlan Murdoch.", "description": "Visiting 25-year-old media heiress Francesca Packer-Barham \u2014 reportedly \u201cback to see my mamma\u201d \u2014 has shelled out an eye-catching amount on a level-40 penthouse.", "authors": ["Stephen Nicholls"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/25125547/capi_ba08edb62f774e621519f6dd7ea11c84_e797dfe7aa20c07d9bc021cdf5c3facd.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
