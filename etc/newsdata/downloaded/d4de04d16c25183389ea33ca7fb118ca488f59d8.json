He was ahead in the count for most of his five innings.\"\n\nWATCH | Blue Jays blank Red Sox:\n\nTrent Thornton pitched five nearly perfect innings and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. drove in three runs in Toronto's 8-0 win. 1:26\n\nRowdy Tellez and Teoscar Hernandez homered and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. drove in three runs for the Blue Jays, who turned the game into a rout with a six-run fifth inning.\n\nToronto (57-89) has won two in a row after ending a seven-game skid. The Blue Jays will go for a sweep of the slumping Red Sox (76-70) \u2014 losers of five straight \u2014 on Thursday night.\n\n\"It's never fun when you're not winning,\" said Boston first baseman Mitch Moreland. \"We've got to start over tomorrow and get back on track.\"\n\nBoth teams used openers for the first two frames. Thornton (5-9), who relieved Wilmer Font, issued one walk and had seven strikeouts.\n\n\"I felt I was doing a pretty good job of executing my pitches when I needed to,\" Thornton said. \"I felt pretty good tonight.\"\n\nThornton puts good advice to use\n\nThornton said veteran teammate Clay Buchholz helped him with a couple different grips on his curveball and he first tried it out last Monday.\n\n\"I was throwing it in my last side [session] and it just kind of clicked,\" Thornton said. \"I brought it into the game and that was probably the most effective my curveball has been all year.\"\n\nBoston lefty Bobby Poyner made his first big-league start before he was replaced by Trevor Kelley (0-1). The Blue Jays took advantage of some weak defence in the fourth inning to open the scoring.\n\nRafael Devers couldn't squeeze a Cavan Biggio fly ball in shallow left field, allowing the rookie to reach on a play generously ruled a two-base hit. Biggio stole third without a throw and scored on a sacrifice fly by Guerrero.\n\nTellez followed with a solo shot for his 19th homer of the season and second blast in as many nights.\n\nToronto loaded the bases in the fifth after singles by Danny Jansen, Bo Bichette and Biggio. Guerrero lashed a Ryan Weber curveball into left field to bring two runs home.\n\nTravis Lakins came on and Randal Grichuk belted the reliever's first pitch off the wall for a two-run double. Hernandez then brought Grichuk home with his 22nd homer of the year.\n\n\"I always say hitting is contagious and it was tonight,\" Montoyo said. \"Everybody had good at-bats.\"", "description": "Rowdy Tellez and Teoscar Hernandez homered and four Toronto pitchers combined on a two-hit shutout as the Blue Jays dumped the Boston Red Sox 8-0 on Wednesday night at Rogers Centre.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280416.1568252919!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/bba-red-sox-blue-jays-20190911.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
