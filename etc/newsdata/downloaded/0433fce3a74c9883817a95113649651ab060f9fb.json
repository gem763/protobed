Probably. This is something that they\u2019ve de facto campaigned on for nearly three years. The impeachment of Donald Trump because he won the 2016 election was not a question of \u2018if\u2019 but \u2018when.\u2019 Yet, no everyone is onboard\u2014and there are other issues as well. In Pennsylvania, a must-win state for both sides, Democrats in the western part of the state are not happy with the Democrats\u2019 impeachment antics. They\u2019re also not thrilled their party is anti-fracking and pushing an agenda that will gut their health insurance. For Medicare for All to work, all private plans have to go, which includes those for union workers. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report noted this recently, adding there is a chasm where Democrats can fall if they come off as too insane.\n\nSpent yesterday w/ a group of mostly union, anti-Trump Ds in western PA. Massive concerns about how a Warren nomination (esp. pledge to ban fracking on day one) would play out in the region.\n\n\n\nDon't underestimate how many voters in SWPA, etc. there are still left for Ds to lose. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 10, 2019\n\n2016 Clinton votes in the city of Philadelphia: 584,025\n\n\n\n2016 Clinton votes in western PA *outside* the city of Pittsburgh: 631,120\n\n\n\nYes, there's still a lot of room for Dems to fall. \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) October 10, 2019\n\nThe problem is that they already have jumped off the cliff into the left-wing abyss. They\u2019re for gutting private health insurance, they want a wealth tax, forgive student loan debt, enact the Green New Deal, hate cops, want to make abortion permissible up until the moment of birth, and give illegal aliens health care benefits\u2014while promoting an open borders agenda. This isn\u2019t just conservatives saying the Democrats have gone off the deep-end, former Obama officials have as well. David Axelrod, a former top adviser to Obama, lamented about the appalling approval numbers at the core of the 2020 Democratic agenda, noting that it\u2019s important to listen to voters and what they want. That\u2019s funny\u2014Democrats hate voters and think their small, elite brain trust is what should be entrusted to make and enforce all of their authoritarian and ruinously expensive policy positions. On the flip side, Trump has to ensure that he can be competitive in the collar counties around Philadelphia, specifically Buck County, where he split with Hillary 48-48, but that result was enough for him to clinch the state, as he ran up the score in the \u2018T\u2019 counties between Philly and Pittsburgh.\n\nHe needs to do that again, and defecting Trump Democrats who are not thrilled with their party and see him as the lesser of two evils doesn\u2019t hurt either. Katie also noted that in Michigan, impeachment isn\u2019t a popular sticking point with blue-collar workers.", "description": ".10/11/2019 15:33:19PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/283/126a4ddf-7e02-49b1-aca8-bd84db02a2f4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
