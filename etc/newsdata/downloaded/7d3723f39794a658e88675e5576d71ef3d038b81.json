The movie is loosely based on the novel Caging Skies by Christine Leunens.\n\n\"It's a huge honour and this is a massive deal for me,\" Waititi said in a video posted by TIFF organizers Sunday.\n\n\"The outpouring of love and emotion and support for the film from the audiences was just the first time I'd experienced that and it's going to stay with me forever. And now this award, it's incredible.\"\n\n\"We need to remind ourselves there's no room in this world for hate and intolerance. Let's put an end to that, and replace it with love.\" \ud83d\udc95<br><br>\u2014 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaikaWaititi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TaikaWaititi</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JojoRabbit?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JojoRabbit</a>, your freshly-crowned <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Grolsch_Global?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Grolsch_Global</a> People's Choice Award Winner. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIFF19?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TIFF19</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/LtULwbSdT3\">pic.twitter.com/LtULwbSdT3</a> \u2014@TIFF_NET\n\nDuring the festival, Waititi defended his film against those critical of its whimsical feel and irreverent take on the waning days of the Nazi regime.\n\n\"I think, more than ever, it's vital that we [remind] people of what happened [during the Second World War],\" he told CBC News.\n\n\"If that involves having to bring in fantasy characters and using magic realism and using different techniques and sometimes comedy, so be it. We have to keep telling these stories.\"\n\nI want to meet these people. They seem nice.
