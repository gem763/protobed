We are aware that British nationals, including children, are living in displaced persons\u2019 camps in Syria, but, owing to the circumstances on the ground, we are not in a position to make an accurate estimate of the number.\n\n\"The safety and security of British nationals abroad is a priority for the Foreign Office, although UK travel advice has consistently advised against all travel to Syria since 2011.\n\n\"Although the UK has no consular presence in Syria from which to provide assistance, we will do all we can for unaccompanied minors and orphans.\n\n\"The Foreign Secretary made it clear to the House last week that the Government will try to help any British unaccompanied minors and orphans in Syria.\n\n\"We work with all concerned in Syria and at home to facilitate the return of unaccompanied or orphan children where feasible. Each case is considered on an individual basis.\"\n\nThe Home Office said it had nothing further to add when contacted by Mirror Online.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nIt is thought there are 60 children and 30 women with British roots in the region, most of whom are with their mums, Human Rights Watch has suggested.\n\nFormer cabinet minister David Davis criticised the \"woefully inadequate\" response of the Government to vulnerable British people living in war-torn Syria.\n\nOne such person is Daniel Islam, who is the baby son of Ashraf - a British ISIS fighter held by Kurdish forces in Syria.\n\nDaniel's aunt, who works in the pharmaceutical industry in East London, has said she will look after the young boy if given the chance.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Ashraf\u2019s baby, he\u2019s our flesh and blood. Of course we\u2019ll look after him,\" she told the paper.\n\n\u201cI know Ashraf going there was a mistake and it was wrong . . . Bring him to England and put him in prison, punish him, prosecute him, but he needs to be in his country.\"\n\nIt is believed that Daniel is in a detention camp with his mother, who was stripped of her British citizenship.\n\nReports say another woman who could return is Tooba Gondal, who recruited and made propaganda for ISIS.\n\nForeign Office officials have approached London based family members to establish the identities of her two children and find out about her alleged activities.\n\nIt has been claimed that detectives are trying to build a case against her so they can prosecute the 25-year-old on her return.\n\n(Image: Universal News And Sport (Europe))\n\nShamima Begum left Britain at the beginning of 2015 when she was just 15-years-old using her older sister\u2019s passport.\n\nIn Syria she married an Isis fighter and the couple had three children, all of whom died of disease or malnutrition.\n\nThe most recent child lost his life while they were in a prison camp in northern Syria.\n\nThe Bethnal Green born teenager was stripped of her citizenship on the grounds of national security in February, amid a political row over whether she was a dual British and Bangladeshi citizen.", "description": "Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab are said to be pushing for a change of policy so British women and children can be repatriated from Syria", "authors": ["Danya Bazaraa", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Itv", "Getty Images", "Universal News And Sport", "Europe"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743081.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Boris-Johnson-And-Jeremy-Hunt-Hold-Darlington-Hustings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
