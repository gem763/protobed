Biden.\n\nBut only 41% say the president has broken the law with what he did.\n\nGOP pollsters say those numbers are likely inflated against Mr. Trump. CBS polled residents rather than likely or even registered voters \u2014 the categories that matter when it comes to whether an issue has power at the ballot box.\n\nStill, there\u2019s little doubt the reluctance to contemplate impeachment, which long reigned in polling, has turned into a willingness to consider it.\n\nMorning Consult/Politico\u2019s tracking survey late last week, after the revelations, found 43% say it\u2019s time to begin \u2014 up from 36% just a week earlier.\n\nSupport among Democrats grew by 13 percentage points, to about four out of five. But so did support among independents, who just a week ago were decidedly opposed, by a 13-point margin. Now they are in favor, 39% to 36%.\n\nEven among Republicans, support for impeachment has grown, though at 10% it\u2019s still not much of a factor.\n\nMatt McDermott, a Democratic pollster, said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s reluctance to back impeachment had kept a lid on public support. Now her embrace has brought Democrats and some independents along.\n\n\u201cNot to be cliche, but voters are motivated by leaders who lead,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to feel that they\u2019re making the \u2018right choices\u2019 politically. These types of cues from political leaders are important, and explain why we\u2019re already seeing perception shifts around impeachment following the support of a formal inquiry by House leaders.\u201d\n\nHe said particularly worrying for the GOP was the rise in support among independents. He said Republicans had expected independents to balk at impeachment, but there\u2019s no sign yet of such a backlash.\n\nRepublican pollsters questioned the sampling decisions of some of the new polls, but also said they\u2019re not surprised \u2014 nor worried \u2014 by the new impeachment support.\n\nGOP pollster Michael McKenna said the impeachment question is essentially now the equivalent of asking whether Mr. Trump should be reelected.\n\nHe said there are still some voters who view impeachment seriously, but this near to the start of voting in Democratic primaries, for most the impeachment question is about whether to retain Mr. Trump in office rather than a look at whether he\u2019s guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n\u201cThey may as well, when you ask about impeachment, ask \u2018President Trump yes or no,\u2019\u201d Mr. McKenna said. \u201cThis is all about the campaign.\u201d\n\nJim McLaughlin, a Trump campaign pollster, points to a survey he did earlier in September, before the latest impeachment developments, that asked whether voters wanted to see congressional Democrats focus on impeachment or legislating. Two-thirds said legislating.\n\nHe said that\u2019s a good place for Mr. Trump to be \u2014 and it\u2019s showing up in those job approval numbers, which are higher than they\u2019ve been since the immediate days after he took office in 2017. In national polling, Mr. Trump is at about 45%, maintaining the level he\u2019s been at since a bump after his State of the Union speech.\n\nMr. McLaughlin says his surveys are even better: \u201cWe\u2019ve consistently had him about 47, 48% job approval.\u201d\n\nHe said that rising approval spurred Democrats to go for impeachment. He also said there could be an element of preemption in that Democrats are worried about what the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the 2016 election will show, and impeachment is a preemptive strike.\n\n\u201cOnce they saw the president\u2019s numbers going up, they said \u2018We gotta do something,\u2019 so they made this thing up,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicted the impeachment push will serve to unify Republicans heading into 2020, consolidating Mr. Trump\u2019s backers.\n\nThe millions of dollars the Trump campaign raised in the hours after Democrats announced their impeachment inquiry was the first tangible sign of that.\n\nIn CBS\u2019s poll, 59% of Republicans said Mrs. Pelosi\u2019s move makes them want to defend Mr. Trump. But a surprisingly strong 34% said they\u2019re looking to see what develops. Just 7% suspect Mr. Trump of wrongdoing.\n\n\u2981 Alex Swoyer contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
