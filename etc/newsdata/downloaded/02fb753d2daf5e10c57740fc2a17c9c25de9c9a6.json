Photo: Francois Duhamel/Twentieth Century Fox\n\nJames Gray\u2019s space opera Ad Astra is so eerily, transfixingly beautiful that I want to purge from my mind its resolution, which reduces what precedes it to a Shaggy Dad story \u2014 an especially earthbound one. In outline, the film is a Kubrick-like retelling of Apocalypse Now in which the Willard character, Roy McBride (Brad Pitt), is the son of the renegade Kurtz figure, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), whose ship disappeared many years ago (this is the \u201cnear future\u201d) in the vicinity of Neptune while searching for signs of distant life. In recent months, McBride Sr. might be responsible (no one can reach him to find out) for anti-matter pulses that threaten the entire solar system; so military brass has put together a top-secret mission to send Roy to Mars to, well, basically phone Dad, the reception being better that far from Earth. Getting to Mars is no cakewalk, mind you. Roy contends not just with the usual shuttle-docking screwups but pirates, mad apes, and other stuff you don\u2019t expect to see off terra firma. It\u2019s a jungle up there.\n\nRoy is a great role for Pitt, who narrates throughout in a measured, groggy voice reminiscent of Martin Sheen\u2019s Willard and whose lack of modulation can thereby pass for existential woe. Roy is required to take a daily \u201cpsych eval,\u201d through which we learn that he has pushed his emotions so deep that nothing ever gets to him. His pulse remains at 80, even when in free fall miles above the planet. \u201cI\u2019ve been trained to compartmentalize,\u201d he tells us, blandly, but it\u2019s more than that, of course. He\u2019s always running from others \u2014 including his wife (Liv Tyler), seen in flashbacks \u2014 along with his own feelings. It\u2019s open to speculation whether his distance from humanity (which he professes to hate) can be attributed to a dad whose eyes were on the stars even at home and left for good when Roy was 12. But you don\u2019t need to speculate too long.\n\nThe movie is filled with exciting cliffhangers (I\u2019ve never seen a zero-gravity knife fight before, with the fighters in space suits) and a few supporting actors register \u2014 chiefly Ruth Negga, Loren Dean, and (too briefly) a sepulchral Donald Sutherland. But it\u2019s mostly Pitt and nothing but. Gray, even more successfully than in Two Lovers and The Lost City of Z, steeps you in his protagonist\u2019s psyche. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re in some sort of hyperbaric chamber, with oxygen meted out gradually to keep us absorbed even when our fight-or-flight instincts tell us to panic \u2014 our pulses remain at 80. Apart from a few spasmodic jolts, the editing (by John Axelrad and Lee Haugen) is fluid, while the colors (the production designer is Kevin Thompson) hum on tranquil frequencies. The sound design is stunning. The composer Max Richter\u2019s usual ambient wash is cut with ethereal harps and plinks from the piano\u2019s highest keys, while sudden silences reverberate with dread. The cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema\u2019s frames are spare, evoking the vast distance between souls. The effect is to make you understand the pressure not to feel \u2014 and hence to experience, with Roy, a fierce longing for the material world.\n\nThat\u2019s the point of all this: Space is a drag, and going in search of extraterrestrial life requires denying or desensitizing oneself to terrestrial life, to the natural, the human. Only when out of his own world does Roy understand how selfishly he has lived and how much he needs to reconnect with his father to understand himself \u2014 at which point his pulse, doncha know, shoots up.\n\n(Light spoilers for Ad Astra below.)\n\nI could hardly agree more with the humanist message of Ad Astra, while at the same time my inner Trekkie is saying, \u201cWe came millions of miles for this?\u201d When we meet McBride Sr. it\u2019s an anticlimax, even with Jones so eloquently haggard, like an elderly, shrunken lion. He\u2019s primed to give a performance but McBride\u2019s madness \u2014 unlike Kurtz\u2019s \u2014 gives him no stature. In the end, Roy could probably have clicked his heels together at any time and gone back to Kansas. I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t, though, because we\u2019d have missed so many thrilling blastoffs and tumbles through space and a vibe that chills you out while making you grieve the absence of connection. I almost wish that resolutions were superfluous, that in our imaginations we could be forever suspended with Roy in the gorgeous void of space.", "description": "With \u201cAd Astra,\u201d James Gray, even more successfully than in \u201cTwo Lovers\u201d and \u201cThe Lost City of Z,\u201d steeps you in his protagonist\u2019s (Brad Pitt) psyche.", "authors": ["David Edelstein"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/19/19-ad-astra.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
