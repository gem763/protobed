Kamala Harris (D-CA) on Tuesday night called President Trump the \u201cmost corrupt and unpatriotic president\u201d in United States history, claiming he has \u201ccommitted crimes in plain sight.\u201d\n\nDuring CNN\u2019s Democrat debate, Harris blasted Trump as a criminal when asked about the House Democrats\u2019 effort to impeach him over a phone call he had with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\n\u201c[Trump] has committed crimes in plain sight,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI mean it\u2019s shocking, but he told us who he was. Look, Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time. During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and get away with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people, he\u2019s been selling out working people, he\u2019s been selling out our values, he\u2019s been selling out our national security,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd on this issue with Ukraine, he\u2019s been selling out our democracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president,\u201d Harris continued. \u201cAnd our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.\u201d\n\nHarris then said Trump is \u201cthe most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.\u201d\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.
