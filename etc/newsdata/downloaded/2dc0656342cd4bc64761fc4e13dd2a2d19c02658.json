Shares of the company under the ticker (SPCE) went as high as $12.91, according Yahoo Finance data.\n\nThe listing was made possible through the finalized merger between Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic, and Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings. The latter was a special purchase acquisition company founded by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya. Shares of Social Capital Hedosophia had previously been listed under the symbol (IPOA) and closed at $11.79 last Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is an exciting opportunity,\u201d former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\u201cI think the jury is out as to whether or not space tourism is a sustainable market, but it will be exciting to follow,\u201d the ex-space traveler said.\n\nVirgin Galactic says it already has customer reservations from more than 600 people in 60 countries. In early October, the company also announced an investment of $20 million from aircraft giant Boeing (BA) and, along with Under Armour (UAA), unveiled sleek space suits passengers will wear on flights.\n\nScott Parazynski, also a former NASA astronaut and author of The Sky Below, sees long term potential for the industry.\n\n\u201cI see ourselves in the barnstorming era of commercial human space travel, and I hold out hope that what's happening in suborbital and low earth orbit space will eventually lead to point-to-point global travel and even touristic space station and lunar outpost flights in the future,\u201d he told Yahoo Finance.\n\nVirgin Galactic's carrier plane makes its way across the apron in front of Spaceport America following a test flight over its new permanent home near Upham, New Mexico, on Thursday, Aug. 15, 2019.

A 90 minute journey will cost a whopping $250,000.\n\n\u201cI'm bullish on commercial human spaceflight as a whole, and it's incredibly exciting that several contenders are about to start launching their first paying customers,\u201d Parazynski said. \u201cWhat's yet to be seen is if there's a sustainable market at a price point where sufficient customers will pay.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a trip with NASA to the International Space Station as a \u201cprivate astronaut\u201d carries a staggering $52 million per person price tag that makes Virgin Galactic flights cheap by comparison. For that reason, leaving the earth for tourist purposes may be the first small step in a journey space enthusiasts can only dream of for now.\n\n\u201cI fear that [Virgin\u2019s] addressable market is rather small, and the ability to drop that price point significantly is going to be extremely challenging,\u201d Parazynski added. \u201cThat said, there are a number of companies trying to out-innovate one another, and that competition should lead to sustainable solutions in the future.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chiao, part of the attraction for would-be commercial travelers \u201cis to say that you have been there. Will that luster wear off after the first 700-1000? We will see.\u201d\n\nClarification: Virgin Galactic will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange as a direct listing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Virgin Galactic will become the first and only space travel company to go public on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, and lots of people are watching closely.", "authors": ["Ines Ferr\u00e9", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NM2zmi0IRB426QccC_jD3A--~B/aD0zMjA0O3c9NDU5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/e06bda60-f0f1-11e9-bb7f-54260ed2993d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
