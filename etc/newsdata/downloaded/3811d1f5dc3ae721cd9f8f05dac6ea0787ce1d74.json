It tied the record for the strongest Atlantic hurricane landfall ever.\n\nThe storm hit Marsh Harbour, the largest city on Great Abaco island, at 2 p.m. ET on Sunday and left it destroyed. The damage to the downtown area is pictured below. Swipe back and forth to see satellite images from before and after Dorian.\n\nThe Red Cross estimated that a total of 13,000 houses were destroyed across the Bahamas \u2014 that's 45% of all homes on the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco.\n\nBahamas officials expect Dorian's death toll to rise as search efforts continue, and the total \"could be staggering,\" Duane Sands, the Bahamas Minister of Health, told the New York Times on Thursday.\n\n\"We are embalming bodies so that we have more capacity as new bodies are brought in,\" Sands said. \"We need to get coolers into Abaco and Grand Bahama, because we believe that we may not have the capacity to store the bodies.\"\n\nBahamas officials are sending morticians and 200 body bags to the Abaco Islands, CNN reported on Friday.\n\nAccessing Marsh Harbour has been difficult because the Leonard Thompson International Airport, pictured below, remained under 6 feet of water. It is still closed to most planes.\n\nThe tiny island of Green Turtle Cay lies just east of the Abacos. When Dorian arrived there on Sunday, its winds blew down trees and ripped houses apart.\n\nThe island's small community of about 500 people is without power, water, or a food supply, according to the Washington Post.\n\n\"We didn't leave because we'd been through other storms,\" Craig Curry, a resident of Green Turtle Cay, told the Washington Post. \"But not this. This was nothing like we've ever seen.\"\n\nCurry said that when the winds blew out a window in his house, he nailed his dining room table over the hole. When another two windows and his door exploded, he retreated to the basement.\n\n\"We fought that storm for two days,\" Curry added. \"Now we're homeless. There's nothing left.\"", "description": "Hurricane Dorian destroyed an estimated 13,000 houses in the Bahamas and put an airport under 6 feet of water.
