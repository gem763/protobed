However, matters were complicated further in last night\u2019s episode when Liv (Isobel Steele) tracked her brother down, and it made it clear that she\u2019s going with him when he sets off with Robert. Will she follow through?\n\nRobert and Aaron\u2019s world came crashing down during Tuesday night\u2019s episode when Victoria (Isabel Hodgins) was forced to inform her brother that Lee had died. A devastated Robert proceeded to discuss his options with his family, but Liv wasted little time in providing him with an answer, when she suggested that he and Aaron should both go on the run together.\n\nAfter some deliberation, they agreed to do just that, and \u2014 after bidding farewell to their families \u2014 the pair set off, as they left the village seemingly forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, last night, viewers saw the police begin to investigate, and Liv struggled with the fact that she\u2019d never see her brother again. Upon reflection, she realised that she couldn\u2019t live with that, so \u2014 when she learned that Mandy (Lisa Riley) was acquiring fake passports for Robert and Aaron, she secretly hitched a ride in the iconic Dingle van and proceeded to surprise her brother and his husband by informing them that she\u2019s going with them.\n\nWhile it\u2019s currently unknown what will transpire next, it\u2019s likely that the realisation of such a statement will sink in for Liv. At the end of the day, she\u2019ll be forced to give up her family and friends forever, and \u2014 considering how fond she is of several of the village\u2019s regulars \u2014 this will undoubtedly be a tall task for her.\n\nEven if she does manage to come to term with these factors and carry on with her plan to abscond with Aaron and Robert, it\u2019s unlikely that Aaron \u2014 or Robert, for that matter \u2014 will want her to come along with them, as they know what she\u2019d be giving up in order to do it.\n\nIn other words: Liv will likely be faced with a difficult dilemma.\n\nThe question is: will she stay, or will she go?\n\nEmmerdale continues on Thursday 17th October at 7pm and 8pm on ITV\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Liv will no doubt find herself in a difficult situation during tonight's episode.", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Liv-wants-to-go-on-the-run-with-Aaron-and-Robert-in-Emmerdale-5847_1571306038.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
