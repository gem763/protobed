(AP) \u2014 Megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress has been selected by Talladega Superspeedway to give Sunday\u2019s pre-race invocation and wave the green flag.\n\nJeffress has warned of a \u201ccivil war-like fracture\u201d if President Donald Trump is impeached.\n\nNASCAR has a tricky relationship with Trump after former chairman Brian France recruited several drivers to attend a 2016 rally, where France endorsed Trump\u2019s candidacy. Trump seized it as an endorsement from all of NASCAR. France later tried to stress this was strictly his opinion.\n\nThe invocation is a staple before every NASCAR national series event, although some do avoid overt religion and politics.\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/apf-AutoRacing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress has been selected by Talladega Superspeedway to give Sunday's pre-race invocation and wave the green flag.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jenna Fryer"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/03/20/3_202018_beltway-jeffress-an8201_c109-0-950-491_s1200x700.jpg?e48ea9cd1ac2a0e950a3f29c9ccf82c81be900ad", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
