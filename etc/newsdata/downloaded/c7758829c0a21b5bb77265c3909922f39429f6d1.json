LOUIS (AP) - Washington reliever Daniel Hudson has been reinstated from the postseason paternity list, rejoining the Nationals before Game 2 of the NL Championship Series.\n\nHudson and his wife welcomed a baby girl Friday. Sean Doolittle then closed out Washington\u2019s 2-0 victory over St. Louis in the NLCS opener, retiring his only four batters.\n\nHudson\u2019s return means Wander Suero has been removed from the Nationals\u2019 active roster against the Cardinals. Game 2 is Saturday in St. Louis.\n\nHudson is 1-0 with two saves in the playoffs, throwing 3 2/3 scoreless innings with five strikeouts.\n\nWashington\u2019s bullpen had the worst ERA in the National League this year at 5.66, but Hudson provided a boost after he was acquired from Toronto at the July 31 trade deadline. The right-hander went 3-0 with a 1.44 ERA and six saves in 24 regular-season appearances with the Nationals.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Washington reliever Daniel Hudson has been reinstated from the postseason paternity list, rejoining the Nationals before Game 2 of the NL Championship Series.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/nlds_dodgers_nationals_baseball_26839_c0-204-4896-3060_s1200x700.jpg?4f73bfd5e643028254bdc4481a457737dfcd6b2f", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
