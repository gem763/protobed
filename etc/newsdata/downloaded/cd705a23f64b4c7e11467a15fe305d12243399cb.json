Hopefully, it's a preview of a regular service that will speed up how people travel from one side of the globe to the other,\" said Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce.\n\nCompetition in the ultra-long haul aviation market has intensified in recent years, with various airlines flying extended routes.\n\nSingapore Airlines launched a near-19 hour journey from Singapore to New York last year, which is currently the world's longest regular commercial flight.\n\nAlso last year, Qantas began a 17-hour non-stop service from Perth to London, while Qatar Airways operates a 17.5-hour service between Auckland and Doha.", "description": "The New York to Sydney flight is part of research on how ultra-long haul journeys affect our bodies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8278/production/_109300433_9ad8c85a-586a-4985-bc8f-45cccecbfbbb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
