Local authorities urged anyone who lived close to the seashore to evacuate as a precaution.\n\nDorian was reclassified to a very intense post-tropical storm as it lost a defined eye as it passed over Halifax though wind speeds of 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour) were equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said.\n\n\u201cThe safety of Canadians is our number one priority and we\u2019re ready to help Atlantic Canada through this storm,\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter.\n\nMore than 330,000 people in the province have lost power, Nova Scotia Power said, but there were no reports of injuries due to the storm.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of hunkered down, and we can see all of the trees that are waving around,\u201d said Danielle Horne, 32, who lives on the eighth floor of an apartment building in Halifax.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a little bit of nervousness for my car, which is parked outside,\u201d she said.\n\nDuring the afternoon, Dorian knocked trees onto houses in the city, blew off at least one roof, and toppled a large crane from the top of a building under construction.\n\nDorian ripped into the Bahamas earlier this week with Category 5 winds and some gusts topping 200 miles per hour (320 kph), leaving a trail of destruction and death, with 43 confirmed dead and the number expected to spike in coming days.\n\nThe storm pounded parts of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks Islands on Friday.\n\nOn Saturday, winds picked up to 100 miles per hour (160 kph) early in the day, making it a Category 2 hurricane, but it weakened as it neared Canada\u2019s coast.\n\nAfter Nova Scotia, Dorian is expected to move toward Prince Edward Island and on Sunday reach Newfoundland, the Canadian Hurricane Centre projected.", "description": "Dorian slammed into Canada's Atlantic coast on Saturday, knocking down trees, cutting power, and blowing over a large construction crane in downtown Halifax, the capital of the province of Nova Scotia.", "authors": ["John Morris", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427548280&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870CI-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
