And on top of that, he defeated both of them\n\nHenderson whitewashed Diaz on the scorecards in Seattle in December 2012 when he claimed a landslide unanimous decision win and retained his UFC lightweight title at UFC on FOX 5. Henderson mixed up his game beautifully throughout the contest to earn scores of 50-43, 50-45, 50-45 and won every round on all three scorecards.\n\nIt was a much closer matchup when Henderson faced Masvidal three years later in November 2015 in Seoul, South Korea, at UFC Fight Night 79. The pair engaged in a tight, tactical welterweight battle through five super-competitive rounds that left the judges split on the final outcome.\n\nHenderson edged it 47-48, 48-47, 49-46 in what turned out to be his final fight for the UFC.\n\nThe experience of sharing the cage with both UFC 244 main eventers makes Henderson the ideal man to break down their respective skillsets ahead of the weekend\u2019s big fight at Madison Square Garden.\n\nSo when Henderson was in Dublin to take on Myles Jury at Bellator 227 last month, we took time out from talking about Henderson\u2019s Bellator assignment to discuss this weekend\u2019s \u201cBMF\u201d title fight between Masvidal and Diaz, and Henderson said there was one key factor at play that would determine who ends up getting their hand raised.\n\n\u201cI gave the fight edge to Jorge, but that being said, now I\u2019ve had time to think about it and actually process it, I think that matchup-wise, I think it\u2019s a good matchup for Nate\u2019s style,\u201d he told MMA Junkie. \u201cI think Jorge is not going to move as much as he should \u2013 he\u2019s just gonna stand there. For Nate to do well, he needs his opponent to just stand there in front of him and let him throw lots of punches. He does well when his punch count is really high. But if you\u2019re not there and he can\u2019t punch at you, his punch count goes down.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the \u201cBMF\u201d fight suggests that the two combatants will look to stand in the center of the octagon and throw down, but Henderson \u2013 who faces Michael Chandler at Bellator Japan on Dec. 29 \u2013 says that if Masvidal fights a little smarter, he has the tools to get the job done.\n\n\u201cI think Jorge will actually kinda stand there more for him because they both like to bang, they\u2019re both gonna throw down \u2013 it\u2019s gonna be a crazy fight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a great fight to watch. And if they stand there, I think Nate could do a little bit of a better job. But if Jorge uses his fight IQ, I think he won\u2019t be there.\n\n\u201cHe has the skill set \u2013 he can do it. But the question is, will he do it? Or will he be like, \u2018I\u2019m the baddest mother(expletive). We\u2019re gonna stand here, and we\u2019re gonna throw down.\u2019 They could easily do that. If they do that, I\u2019ll go with Nate. If Jorge uses his fight IQ, he has the skill set to beat Nate if he chooses to do so.\u201d\n\nGallery Photos: Nate Diaz, Jorge Masvidal at UFC 244 news conference in New York view 19 images\n\nGallery Photos: Jorge Masvidal through the years view 44 images", "description": "Former UFC lightweight champ Benson Henderson has beaten Nate Diaz and Jorge Masvidal and explains who holds the key to victory at UFC 244.", "authors": ["Simon Head", "John Morgan", "Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Matt Erickson", "George Garcia", "Dan Tom", "Mike Bohn", "Abbey Subhan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/benson-henderson-jorge-masvidal-ufc-fight-night-79.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
