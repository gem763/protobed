(AP) \u2014 New York Jets guard Kelechi Osemele had surgery on his ailing right shoulder Friday despite the team not approving the procedure.\n\nThe operation to repair a torn labrum was performed by Dr. Glen Ross in Boston, according to Osemele\u2019s agent, Andrew Kessler.\n\nThe Jets were made aware of Osemele going forward with his plan to have surgery. But because he was not with the team and the surgery wasn\u2019t approved, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said the Jets consider it an \u201cunexcused absence.\u201d The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team has not publicly commented on the situation.\n\nOsemele is officially listed by the team as doubtful to play Sunday at Jacksonville. He hasn\u2019t taken the field since Week 3.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about Jacksonville,\u201d coach Adam Gase said, declining comment on Osemele\u2019s status.\n\nOsemele and the Jets are locked in a standoff in which the player says he needs the surgery now.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s at the point where I can\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d Osemele said of his shoulder Wednesday in the locker room.\n\nThe team believes the surgery could be delayed and he can play through it, and the Jets have been fining him for \u201cconduct detrimental to the team\u201d for not practicing.\n\nThe NFL Players Association released a statement Thursday saying it supports Osemele and is \u201cconsidering all options to protect\u201d him. The NFLPA also said it\u2019s \u201cnot appropriate or ethical\u201d for an employer to dictate any employee\u2019s medical needs or treatment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that it wasn\u2019t frustrating to be in this position considering what I\u2019ve been able to accomplish in this league and the type of player that I am, to be dealing with something like this is slightly disrespectful,\u201d Osemele said Wednesday. \u201cBut, it\u2019s outside of my control and I\u2019m trying to be positive about it.\u201d\n\nOsemele was acquired in a trade with Oakland in March and said he first felt pain in the shoulder on Aug. 5 during training camp with the Jets. The two-time Pro Bowl selection said he re-injured the shoulder at New England on Sept. 22. Osemele said he was receiving treatments on the shoulder during the first three weeks of the season and taking anti-inflammatory prescription drugs, but did not appear on the Jets\u2019 injury reports with a shoulder ailment during that time.\n\nThe 30-year-old offensive lineman was examined by the team doctors, and then received a second medical opinion from a doctor in California based on his scans and tests. Osemele then flew to see Ross on Tuesday for a third opinion, and posted the doctor\u2019s report on his Instagram page. Ross\u2019 note said Osemele \u201cshould undergo a right shoulder arthroscopy, labral repair and cyst debridement.\u201d He added that Osemele \u201chas a posterior/inferior labral tear and a large cyst.\u201d\n\nThe team is not debating that Osemele needs surgery. The conflict has been over when he needs to have it \u2014 immediately or after the season. The Jets believe, based on the medical reports, that it is a pre-existing injury Osemele has played through for a while, but the offensive lineman said he can no longer take pain killers and should have the surgery now so he has time to heal and prepare for next season.\n\nOsemele is making a fully guaranteed $9.85 million this season. He is due to make $11.35 million next season, but that money is not guaranteed and he \u201cabsolutely, 100%\u201d expects to be cut by the Jets in the offseason.\n\nNOTES: LB C.J. Mosley will not play against Jacksonville as the Jets continue to determine if more than just a groin injury is ailing him. \u201cWe\u2019ll know more information after we get through this game as far as what we\u2019re going to be doing, what he\u2019s going to be doing,\u201d Gase said. Mosley was injured during the season opener and returned Monday night against New England, but did not appear to have his usual burst. Gase wouldn\u2019t rule out Mosley going on season-ending injured reserve. \u201cI think everything is on the table right now,\u201d he said. \u2026 LT Kelvin Beachum (ankle), RB/KR Trenton Cannon (foot/ankle) and LB Albert McClellan (concussion) are also out against Jacksonville. \u2026 TE Chris Herndon (hamstring) and LB Neville Hewitt (neck/knee) are doubtful, while DE Henry Anderson (shoulder), WR/PR Braxton Berrios (hamstring) and CB Trumaine Johnson (toe) are questionable. Johnson was limited Friday after being injured during practice. \u2026 WR Jamison Crowder (knee) was a full participant after being limited Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "FLORHAM PARK, N.J.
