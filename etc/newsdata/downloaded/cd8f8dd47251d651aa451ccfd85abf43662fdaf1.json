Schmidt knew his defense was coached better than that, and defense coach Andy Farrell said on Wednesday, the day before Ireland\u2019s third pool match against Russia in Kobe, that they\u2019ve had extra instruction to make sure, above all, that they adapt to referee Jerome Garces.\n\n\u201cThe only point Joe was trying to make yesterday is that we\u2019re a disciplined side - we pride ourselves on our discipline massively,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back into ourselves. You\u2019ve got to adapt and have a no-excuse mentality.\u201d\n\nThe rugby league great added, \u201cWe\u2019ve been practicing rugby league this week by going back 10 meters so we\u2019re not offside. We can\u2019t let that affect ourselves. All we can do is make sure we\u2019re disciplined, and we want to show that on Thursday night.\u201d\n\nFarrell said Ireland\u2019s defense overall against Japan wasn\u2019t good enough, mainly due to Japan\u2019s strong play. He was proud, though, of winger Keith Earls chasing back to make a try-saving tackle on Kenki Fukuoka right near the end and preserve Ireland a bonus point.\n\nHe said Irish ambitions of winning the Rugby World Cup were far from extinguished. He pointed to England, a team he was previously involved with, reaching the 2007 final after a hammering from South Africa in the pool stage; of France reaching the 2011 final after a pasting from New Zealand in the pool stage; and South Africa reaching the 2015 semifinals after the historic loss to Japan.\n\n\u201cYou can use a setback in the right manner,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cAfter a couple of days of understanding the reasons why, we\u2019re in good spirits, back on track and ready to prove a point.\n\n\u201cThe feeling in the camp is one of wanting to put things right on the pitch on Thursday night. That can\u2019t come quick enough.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s said the need to adapt on Thursday will be crucial, because the previous games under the roof at Kobe demanded it. The ball and grass start off dry, but in the humidity, both become slippery. Farrell said their analysis of both previous games there showed the England-United States game produced 30 handling errors, and the Scotland-Samoa game 35 errors.\n\n\u201cHow do we adapt? We make sure there\u2019s a no-excuse mentality,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cThere are going to be errors, we need to make sure that our defense shapes up pretty quickly to anything that is turned over.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Three of the four offside calls against Ireland were apparently wrong.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
