Sucharita, said there were 61 people - 50 passengers and 11 crew members, all of them Indian nationals - on board the boat when it capsized on the Godavari river.\n\nA search operation was underway to try to find the missing people.\n\nTwenty-four people have been rescued so far while 25 others are missing, Sucharita said.\n\nThe accident occurred near Kachuluru village in East Godavari district, 380 kilometers (236 miles) east of the state\u2019s capital, Hyderabad. The boat was heading from Singanapalli to Papikondalu, a famous tourist spot.\n\nSucharita said tour boats had been barred from operating on the route following the recent flooding of the river and it was not clear how the boat that capsized had managed to take out the tourists.\n\n\u201cStern action will be taken against the culprits,\u201d Sucharita said.\n\nApart from tourists, residents in the area depend on boats and ferries to travel between villages on the banks of the Godavari.\n\nIn May 2018, 30 people were killed when a similar boat carrying local people capsized not far from the scene of Sunday\u2019s accident. A few months later, a boat carrying 80 tourists caught fire when a cooking gas cylinder exploded, but there were no casualties.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A sightseeing boat capsized on a swollen river in southern India on Sunday, killing 12 people and leaving 25 others missing, an official said.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Omer Farooq"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
