Earlier in the day, the Washington Post decided to run an obituary on the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The problem though? They painted al-Baghdadi as some kind of decent man who studied Islam. It's like the outlet completely missed the years of beheadings, rapes and torture that the Islamic State carried out.\n\nThe Post received quite a bit of flak for failing to call al-Baghdadi exactly what he is: a terrorist. But apparently others in the mainstream media didn't learn from WaPo's mistake. It wasn't long before Bloomberg shared an article about the terrorist's life. Again, he was made out to be a \"teacher\" no one knew about. Not a terrorist who orchestrated the kidnapping, raped and killing of young women or the beheading of journalists.\n\n3. What is going on?\n\n\n\nHe was a terrorist and rapist! @bpolitics pic.twitter.com/3AZERT7XkU \u2014 Yashar Ali ?? (@yashar) October 27, 2019\n\nAnd, again, Twitter was quick to point out the parallels between WaPo and Bloomberg.\n\nJust a good old-fashioned \u201crags to riches\u201d story. It\u2019s a shame the good ones have to die so young, eh @bpolitics? https://t.co/6aIF6V7Hnp \u2014 Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) October 27, 2019\n\nNo one:\n\n\n\nWashington Post: RIP to a legend\n\n\n\nAlso Washington Post: issuing correction on a previous post of mine, regarding the terror group ISIL. you do not, under any circumstances, \u201cgotta hand it to them\u201d\n\n\n\nBloomberg: LEEROYYYYYYYYYY JENKINNNNNNNNNNNNSSSSS pic.twitter.com/XWBexJXFpJ \u2014 Siraj Hashmi (@SirajAHashmi) October 27, 2019\n\nBloomberg News:\n\nHey that al-Baghdadi gentleman was truly an inspiration. pic.twitter.com/nYCDxvo4MK \u2014 Matt Wolking (Text TRUMP to 88022) (@MattWolking) October 27, 2019\n\nHe was a terrorist. https://t.co/b00Ivq449C \u2014 Jacob Airey (@realJacobAirey) October 27, 2019\n\nAnd guess what? The leftist news organization suddenly changed their tune.\n\nOh, look. Bloomberg is changing their tune. pic.twitter.com/nlhg9iQ1cB \u2014 Beth Baumann (@eb454) October 27, 2019\n\nWhen the leftist media wonders why average Americans hate them, this is a prime example. They hate President Donald Trump so much that they can't even label someone a terrorist when they literally carry out terrorist attacks. This shouldn't be something that's political. This is something that we should all agree on. An organization that kidnaps, tortures, rapes and murders people is disgusting and vile. And their actions should be condemned by all.", "description": "Figures..10/27/2019 20:23:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/298/92a61346-f7a0-44d0-9797-ba15710c4764.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
