The privilege, which allows a president to block information from being shared with other branches of government, typically covers private discussions a president has with White House advisers, or internal discussions among executive branch officials. Photos have surfaced of Parnas and Fruman with Trump, but the president has said he does not know the men and that he often poses for photos.\n\nDavid Sklansky, a former federal prosecutor, said the privilege is limited to communications inside the executive branch and would not apply to communications between Trump and Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani was acting as a private adviser for Trump and not part of the White House, said Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School.\n\nJohn Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, agreed.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think they have any plausible claim to protection under any kind of executive privilege or immunity,\" Yoo said.\n\nMacMahon and Joseph Bondy, another attorney for Parnas, declined to comment.\n\nLegal experts said Parnas might have better luck arguing that some documents are covered by attorney-client privilege, which protects communications between lawyers and clients. Parnas' lawyer raised that possibility in court as well.\n\nA prosecutor said on Wednesday that the government has arranged for a group of lawyers known as a \u201cfilter team\u201d to review potentially privileged communications.\n\nBut the complicated nature of Giuliani's relationship with Parnas would made it difficult to claim communications should be kept from prosecutors, the experts said.\n\nGiuliani has told Reuters he was paid $500,000 to consult on technology and provide legal advice on regulatory issues in connection with a company Parnas helped found.\n\nPeter Joy, a professor of criminal law at Washington University in St. Louis, said communications between Giuliani and Parnas could be protected by attorney-client privilege only if they were kept confidential and made for the purpose of seeking or giving legal advice.\n\nDiscussions between the two men in furtherance of Giuliani's Biden-related efforts in Ukraine were unlikely to be protected, he said.\n\n\"It is not legal work to try to get opposition information,\" Joy said.\n\nCommunications aimed at furthering an illegal act also are not covered by attorney-client privilege, said Daniel Medwed, a professor of criminal law at Northeastern University School of Law.\n\nProsecutors said Parnas and Fruman conspired to contribute foreign money including at least $1 million from an unidentified Russian businessman to candidates for federal and state offices to buy influence. U.S. law prohibits foreign donations in American elections.\n\n\"If it turns out these communications related to a crime or fraud, then the privilege claim is not going to fly,\" Medwed said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jan Wolfe and Karen Freifeld; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Dan Grebler and David Gregorio)", "description": "On Wednesday, Lev Parnas pleaded not guilty in Manhattan federal court to using a shell company to donate money to a pro-Trump election committee and illegally raising money for a former congressman as part of an effort to have the president remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.
