The fires and related power outages forced closures, halted research and upended plans.\n\nAD\n\nUniversity officials are grappling with shifting and disparate problems, as they weigh the effect on vulnerable students, critical research, hospitals and employees. The issues, ranging from annoyances to emergencies, include smoke and ash in the air, power outages, road closures, evacuations of nearby communities and, in some places, approaching flames and destruction. Some employees have lost their homes. Some students are traumatized.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very stressful time, very high anxiety,\u201d said Frank Chong, president of Santa Rosa Junior College in Northern California.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, the winds came in and then they were gone and the devastation was there,\u201d Chong said of the historic 2017 fires. \u201cThis time around, the winds keep coming back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt Mount St. Mary\u2019s, the danger was direct and very close.\n\nSeveral people complained on social media that even when flames were rising behind their dorms and ash was falling on campus, the university still had not sent out an alert to evacuate.\n\nUniversity spokeswoman Debbie Ream said that within three minutes of receiving an evacuation notice from the Los Angeles Fire Department, school officials made the decision to evacuate the Chalon Campus. The private liberal arts school for women has about 450 students living on its campus, not far from the spot where the Getty Fire flared.\n\nAD\n\nReam said the alert was sent at 2:53 a.m. and that by 3:30 or 3:35 a.m., the campus had been evacuated. She said some students drove away, and the university provided shuttles to help others. She said one group of students evacuated by foot, under the direction of the Los Angeles Fire Department. Some of those students were picked up and transported by college personnel or by emergency vehicles.\n\nAD\n\nReam said some students went to homes nearby, and some were housed on the school\u2019s Doheny Campus near downtown Los Angeles, moving into empty dorm rooms or sharing space with students there.\n\nAt one point, the fire had surrounded Mount St. Mary\u2019s, but the damage to the campus has been minimal, Ream said.\n\nClasses resumed Tuesday morning at the University of California at Los Angeles, after a day of cancellations, updates and alerts.\n\nAD\n\nIn Northern California, the Kincade Fire is raging, and power has been shut off in some areas to minimize risk.\n\nThe University of California at Berkeley resumed normal operations Tuesday, after Pacific Gas & Electric restored power to campus Monday afternoon. Classes had been canceled Monday.\n\nAD\n\nHumboldt State University shut down its campus and canceled classes through Tuesday.\n\nSanta Rosa Junior College canceled classes through Friday.\n\nThe wind keeps shifting, Chong said. Sometimes, he can feel the gusts even far from the mountaintops and canyons where the fierce winds swirl, and the burnt-smoke smell comes and goes.\n\nPeople are walking around with heavy face masks and flashlights, said Paul Gullixson, spokesman for Sonoma State University. \u201cThat\u2019s the symbol of Sonoma County right now.\u201d\n\nSonoma State is about 15 miles south of the fire, but concerns about air quality, power and evacuations were serious enough to close the campus all week. Classes were canceled, and residence halls were locked, leaving more than 3,000 students to find other places to stay.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey have some generators keeping temperatures stable in laboratories and providing minimal lighting, Gullixson said. But this power outage took out a pumping system that is relied on for water for bathrooms and, crucially, fire suppression.\n\nAbout 80 of the school\u2019s students, faculty and staff members lost their homes in the 2017 fire, Gullixson said, including the university\u2019s president. They are beginning a relief effort and ensuring counselors will be on hand when campus reopens.\n\nMany students had already been displaced. Austin Leonard, a junior studying neuroscience at Sonoma State, heard police sirens at 4 a.m. Sunday at his family\u2019s home in Santa Rosa.\n\nAD\n\nHe could see a tree shaking as they evacuated, and he could feel the wind that wasn\u2019t the usual cold, crisp breeze from the coast. \u201cIt was the same in 2017,\u201d he said. \u201cA kind of eerie, dry, hollow wind that came through.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey had already been warned, so he had packed some things. He didn\u2019t take a lot, but he made sure to bring his school backpack: He wants to go to medical school.\n\n\u201cI want to keep my 4.0,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked hard for that. I didn\u2019t want to have another fire throw a wrench in my academic work.\u201d\n\nStudents do not stop thinking about school even in an emergency, he said. When everyone is worrying about the present, students can\u2019t stop worrying about the future, too.\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KyclzkefOKwwy77xKwG972GiN-g=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SHDXP2HZ7QI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
