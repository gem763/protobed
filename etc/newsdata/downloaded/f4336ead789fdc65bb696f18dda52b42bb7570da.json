Police have not named the student nor said how he died.\n\nA special police team had been brought in to make a formal identification of the student, authorities added.\n\nDe la Rey said in a statement that it was an extremely distressing time for the campus and that school officials would also investigate \"how this situation could have occurred and what actions need to be taken.\"\n\n\"For us, it is inconceivable to imagine how these circumstances could have occurred,\" she said.\n\nHipkins told the Associated Press that he was concerned about the case and that his office would be looking into it, too.\n\n\"If you're going into a hall of residence or a hostel, you are paying top dollar for not just a roof over your head but also the pastoral care that goes with that,\" Hipkins told the news agency. \"And I think clearly that\u2019s not been present in this case.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that an Australian company, Campus Living Villages, operates the dorm. The company, which also operates dorms in the United States and United Kingdom, said it was saddened by the death but wouldn\u2019t comment further per the family's request for privacy, the AP reported.\n\nAccording to Stuff, the dorm costs nearly $16,400 for the 2019 academic year, which lasts 41 weeks. The university says the dorm houses first-year students and is fully catered.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press.
