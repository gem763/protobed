The new data shows that 110 million people already live in places that are below the high tide line, which Mr Strauss attributes to protective measures like sea walls and other barriers.\n\nThe Climate Central chief executive said cities must invest vastly greater sums in such defences and they must do it quickly.\n\nBut even if that investment happens, defensive measures can go only so far. Mr Strauss offered the example of New Orleans, a city below sea level that was devastated in 2005 when its extensive levees and other protections failed during Hurricane Katrina.\n\n\u201cHow deep a bowl do we want to live in?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe new projections suggest that much of Mumbai, India\u2019s financial capital and one of the largest cities in the world, is at risk of being wiped out. Built on what was once a series of islands, the city\u2019s historic downtown core is particularly vulnerable.\n\nOverall, the research shows that countries should start preparing now for more citizens to relocate internally, according to Dina Ionesco of the International Organisation for Migration, an intergovernmental group that coordinates action on migrants and development.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to ring the alarm bells,\u201d Ms Ionesco said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nShe said there is little modern precedent for this scale of population movement.\n\nThe disappearance of cultural heritage could bring its own kind of devastation. Alexandria, Egypt, founded by Alexander the Great around 330BC could be lost to rising waters.\n\nIn other places, the migration caused by rising seas could trigger or exacerbate regional conflicts.\n\nBasra, the second-largest city in Iraq, could be mostly underwater by 2050. If that happens, the effects could be felt well beyond Iraq\u2019s borders, according to John Castellaw, a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general who was chief of staff for US Central Command during the Iraq War.\n\nFurther loss of land to rising waters there \u201cthreatens to drive further social and political instability in the region, which could reignite armed conflict and increase the likelihood of terrorism,\u201d said Mr Castellaw, who is now on the advisory board of the Centre for Climate and Security, a research and advocacy group in Washington.\n\n\u201cSo this is far more than an environmental problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a humanitarian, security and possibly military problem too.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "Rising seas could affect three times more people by 2050 than previously thought, according to new research, threatening to all but erase some of the world\u2019s great coastal cities.", "authors": ["Denise Lu", "Christopher Flavelle"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/08/gettyimages-456973178.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
