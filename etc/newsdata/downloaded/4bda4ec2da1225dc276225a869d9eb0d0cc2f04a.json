But back in August De Niro was in the news for something else. His company filed a $6 million lawsuit against a former employee named Graham Chase Robinson. The lawsuit called Robinson a \u201cdisloyal employee\u201d and accused her of charging personal expenses on her company credit card, improperly reimbursing herself from the office\u2019s petty cash fund, and \u201cbinge-watching astounding hours of TV shows on Netflix\u201d during working hours. In sum, the suit portrayed Robinson as a loafer and a thief. Today, Robinson responded with her own $12 million lawsuit accusing De Niro of sexual harassment and discrimination:\n\n\u201cRobert De Niro is someone who has clung to old mores,\u201d states a complaint filed on Thursday in New York federal court. \u201cHe does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals. He does not care that gender discrimination in the workplace violates the law. Ms. Robinson is a casualty of this attitude.\u201d Robinson accuses the famous actor of gratuitous unwanted physical contact. \u201cAmong other things, De Niro would direct Ms. Robinson to scratch his back, button his shirts, fix his collars, tie his ties and prod him awake when he was in bed,\u201d it reads. \u201cDe Niro also stood idly by while his friend slapped Ms. Robinson on her buttocks.\u201d Robinson also claims De Niro made sexually charged comments, including calling her a \u201cbitch\u201d and a \u201cbrat\u201d while labeling another female business partner a \u201cc\u2014.\u201d \u201cDe Niro made vulgar, inappropriate and gendered comments to Ms. Robinson,\u201d continues the complaint. \u201cHe would joke with Ms. Robinson about his Viagra prescription. De Niro smirked to Ms. Robinson about his young paramour, who was around Ms. Robinson\u2019s age.\n\nIn addition to the harassment claims, Robinson says the big lawsuit the company filed against her was a pre-emptive attempt to sully her name. From her lawsuit:\n\nDe Niro was enraged at the prospect of Ms. Robinson bringing a lawsuit challenging his behavior. So, he retaliated and struck first. On the heels of Ms. Robinson\u2019s complaints of gender discrimination, De Niro had Canal Productions file an abusive, preemptive lawsuit against her. The lawsuit concocted false allegations designed to inhibit Ms. Robinson from pursuing her claims, destroy her reputation, and obliterate her job prospects.\n\nThe lawsuit also contradicts the claim made in the previous lawsuit that Robinson is a loafer who sat around watching Netflix on company time:\n\nAs a result of the demands De Niro placed on Ms. Robinson, she had to work longer hours than her male colleagues. De Niro described Ms. Robinson as \u201cchained\u201d to the office. On weekdays, it was typical for Ms. Robinson to start working by around 7 a.m. and stop working around 8 p.m. She typically worked through breakfast, lunch, and dinner. In addition, she also routinely worked additional hours during weekends. In sum, Ms. Robinson routinely worked approximately 20 to 30 hours of overtime per week (or more) without receiving any overtime pay.\n\nI obviously don\u2019t know who is telling the truth here, if anyone. De Niro\u2019s lawyer told the Hollywood Reporter the allegations were \u201cbeyond absurd.\u201d Maybe, but as part of their lawsuit Robinson\u2019s lawyers posted the audio of an angry phone message DeNiro left her in 2012 (h/t Buzzfeed). The language here is NSFW and, at a minimum, suggests De Niro wasn\u2019t always an easy person to work for.", "description": "\"He does not accept the idea that men should treat women as equals.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Robert-DeNiro.jpg"}
