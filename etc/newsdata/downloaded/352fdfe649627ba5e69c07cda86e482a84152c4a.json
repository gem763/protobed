The US Federal Trade Commission let the company off relatively easy in 2013. Antitrust advocates have predicted that the next threat would come from state attorneys general.\n\nMonday, that forecast came true, when Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley said he is investigating whether Google violated Missouri\u2019s consumer-protection and antitrust laws. Hawley\u2019s investigative subpoena demanded information about Google\u2019s alleged manipulation of search results to privilege its own products, scraping of content from its competitors, and its collection and use of user data. In a statement Hawley pledged to not \u201clet private consumer information be jeopardized by industry giants, especially to pad their profits.\u201d\n\nSkeptics see the move as a publicity stunt. Critics see it as an inevitable response to Google\u2019s stupefying market power. But nearly everyone agrees that Google\u2019s regulatory woes are unlikely to stop in Missouri and that Hawley\u2019s actions are a sign of more trouble for Silicon Valley behemoths.\n\n\u201cThere is a pit in the stomach in Mountain View because Josh Hawley is a harbinger of what\u2019s coming,\u201d says Scott Cleland, an internet competition analyst who worked in the George H.W. Bush administration. \u201cThe state AGs are very closely aligned, both Democrat and Republican, on Google issues,\u201d he says. Pursuing Google is \u201csmart enforcement, smart policy, and smart politics, whether you\u2019re a Democrat or a Republican,\u201d he adds.\n\nHawley issued the subpoena less than two weeks after executives from Google, as well as Facebook and Twitter, endured two days of harsh questioning on Capitol Hill about their roles in allowing Russia to meddle in the 2016 election.\n\nIn one respect, Hawley\u2019s investigation is \u201cone AG in one state,\u201d says Bradley Tusk, a political fixer for Silicon Valley companies. But, he says, the bigger concern for Google is that \u201cthe worm has turned\u201d in public perception of the search giant. The same officials who used to scramble to get Google to bring its Fiber high-speed internet service to their jurisdictions may now look good by going after Google.\n\nTusk, an investor in Uber, says the shift in public posture toward Google reminds him of the shift that Uber faced, when the tide turned from \u201cgreat to be associated with you to great to be seen as attacking you.\" He contrasted Google\u2019s treatment with how cities and states are competing for Amazon\u2019s planned second headquarters. Amazon is \u201ca physical tangible presence with lots of jobs to fill, even if the retail price to be paid is significant,\u201d he says. With Google, \u201cthere is not the sense that they are out there contributing to the economy.\u201d Algorithmic bidding \u201cis a lot less tangible to people.\u201d (Tusk has consulted for Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary.)\n\nGoogle needs to find a way to deal with increased political pressure on all sides, says Tusk. \u201cI don\u2019t think it comes from hiring more and more lobbyists,\u201d no matter what Google\u2019s legislative-affairs team suggests. \u201cIt can help you tamp down on it, but fundamentally the problem isn\u2019t your relationship [with Washington], it\u2019s your image.\u201d\n\nState prosecutors have a record of stirring up trouble for tech behemoths. The US government\u2019s high-profile Microsoft investigation began with state attorneys general. In 2015, when Google sought to stop a subpoena from Mississippi\u2019s attorney general, 40 of his colleagues, including 23 Republicans and 17 Democrats, fought back.\n\nIn a statement, a Google spokesperson said, \"We have not yet received the subpoena, however, we have strong privacy protections in place for our users and continue to operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment.\"\n\nHawley\u2019s concerns about Google\u2019s business practices mirror some of the claims from the European Union\u2019s antitrust ruling against Google, such as privileging Google products in its search results. But he also struck increasingly common populist tropes against Google and other Silicon Valley giants.", "description": "Missouri's attorney general issues a subpoena to Google over antitrust and consumer-protection issues, in what could be the first of many such moves.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Nitasha Tik", "Nitasha Tiku", "Alex Baker-Whitcomb", "Matt Simon", "Jason Parham", "Lily Hay Newman", "Daniel Oberhaus", "Boone Ashworth", "Michael Calore"], "top_image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/5a0a41707a15641bfb1d39d0/master/w_2560,c_limit/JoshHawley-FeatureArt-862524024.jpg", "published_at": "2017-11-14"}
