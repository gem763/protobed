(https://bit.ly/2l99PjS)\n\nMatch Group and its parent company InterActiveCorp <IAC.O> did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, Match said that in August 2019 the FTC referred claims against it to the U.S. Department of Justice and that it believed they were without merit.\n\nShares of Match Group fell as much as 6%, while those of InterActiveCorp <IAC.O> dropped nearly 4%.\n\nThe FTC also said consumers who considered purchasing a Match.com subscription generally were unaware that as many as 25% to 30% of Match.com members who register each day are using it to perpetrate phishing schemes and extortion scams.\n\nThe agency alleged that the company also made it difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Neha Malara in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "description": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday alleged that Match Group Inc , which owns Tinder and other dating sites, knowingly sent automated advertisements with expressions of interest from accounts which it knew were likely fake. \"We believe that Match.com conned people into paying for subscriptions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/u2XzMeqpgP2u8.TeuN8eVg--~B/aD0zMzI7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters-finance.com/cf39d6b3ebc98fb29e10c4776a7331b4", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
