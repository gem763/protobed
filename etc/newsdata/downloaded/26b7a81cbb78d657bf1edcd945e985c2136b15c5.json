The 2017 tax cut cost $1.5 trillion, blowing the deficit past the trillion dollar mark this year.\n\nIt\u2019s a big change from not that long ago, when politicians ran away from the T-word \u2014 one reason why Obama\u2019s stimulus package clocked in at $787 billion was because lawmakers didn\u2019t want to cross the trillion-dollar threshold.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t seem scared at all now \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cIt\u2019s a race to see who can one-up each other with the bigger plan.\u201d\n\nThe shift is a byproduct of the Democratic field\u2019s leftward drift. The catch in the ballooning proposals is that they can seem politically unrealistic, especially if Congress remains under divided control after next year\u2019s elections.\n\nStill, the skyrocketing price tags have alarmed budget watchdogs, who warn of another trillion-dollar figure: the deficit. They point to Congressional Budget Office figures released earlier this month showing the government is already running a $1.07 trillion shortfall through the first 11 months of the government\u2019s fiscal year. The nonpartisan agency predicts trillion-dollar deficits every year for the foreseeable future.\n\nThose big-ticket proposals are driving candidates to search for more exotic tax increases that can generate the cash needed to at least partially offset the costs. Warren and Sanders are turning to a new wealth tax, for example, while Booker wants to tax unrealized capital gains.\n\nSome of those proposed tax increases are so novel that budget scorekeepers aren\u2019t even sure how to estimate how much revenue they\u2019d raise. Two of the nation\u2019s most prominent economists, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and University of California economist Emmanuel Saez, have been jousting for months over Warren\u2019s wealth tax, with Summers accusing Saez of vastly overestimating how much it would produce.\n\nIn the meantime, the oft-cited quote attributed to the late Sen. Everett Dirksen \u2014 \u201cA billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you\u2019re talking real money\u201d \u2014 seems increasingly anachronistic.\n\nBack in the Obama administration, lawmakers bent over backwards to avoid hitting the $1 trillion mark. Democrats ducked it with their 2009 stimulus package, even though many economists warned at the time it was not big enough to contend with the Great Recession. (To keep things in perspective, that $787 billion translates to $951 billion in today\u2019s dollars).\n\nWhen Congress approved the Affordable Care Act in 2010, CBO said it would expand insurance coverage at a cost of $938 billion, though the legislation would actually reduce the deficit, thanks to offsetting changes lawmakers made to the budget. Congress has since repealed or delayed a half-dozen tax increases that were supposed to help defray the program\u2019s cost.\n\nBernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had several trillion-dollar proposals during his 2016 presidential campaign, but at the time even some liberals mocked their cost as unrealistically large.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Once elected, of course, Trump pushed through a $1.5 trillion tax cut.\n\nNow, there's little hesitation to push the line further out.\n\nSanders has at least four mega-proposals dealing with Medicare, climate change, college-tuition costs and, most recently, affordable housing. In addition to her college tuition proposal, Warren has a $3 trillion climate change plan and a plan to expand Social Security benefits that also looks to top $1 trillion.\n\nHarris is calling for $10 trillion \u201cin public and private funding\u201d to fight climate change. She also has a $3 trillion plan to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, a wage supplement for low-income Americans. Buttigieg this month introduced a health care plan he said would cost $1.5 trillion. His environmental plan would cost between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion, he figures.\n\nBooker has a $3 trillion environmental plan. Beto O\u2019Rourke would spend $5 trillion on the environment while Joe Biden has earmarked $1.7 trillion for climate change.\n\nEven Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) who has repeatedly criticized her opponents' proposals as unrealistically large, has a $1 trillion infrastructure plan.\n\nMany of the candidates say they would pay for their plans, which is forcing them to be more upfront about having to raise taxes.\n\nSome are looking beyond traditional income tax increases for additional cash. Aside from her wealth tax, Warren would also impose a new surcharge on large corporations, based on an alternative set of accounting rules. Booker wants to begin taxing capital gains annually, instead of only when assets are sold. Sanders, meanwhile, has endorsed a new levy on financial transactions, among other increases.\n\nSome of the proposals are so unusual that experts say they aren\u2019t sure how to estimate how much they\u2019d produce.\n\nThey say, for example, they don\u2019t have a fix on how much stuff wealthy people own that could be hit by a wealth tax and they don\u2019t fully understand what the rich might be able to do to avoid the levy.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is pretty unique,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, which produces estimates of presidential contenders\u2019 tax plans. \u201cNot only are these new, but they are on tax bases that we don\u2019t know a lot about.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/7f/c6/b371e28f4c298f6970df00fe11cc/190927-biden-warren-sanders-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
