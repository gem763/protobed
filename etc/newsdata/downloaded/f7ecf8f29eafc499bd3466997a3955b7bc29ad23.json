In an effort to try to fill the Rose Bowl for a key matchup against the No. 5 team in the country, UCLA gave away four extra tickets to season ticket holders.\n\nApparently, it\u2019s going to take more than that to entice fans to watch a program that has started the season 0-3 and is coming off a 3-9 campaign.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the Rose Bowl crowd as #Sooners take the field. Ton of OU fans here... not a ton of other fans pic.twitter.com/f3oRkrdvVp \u2014 Ryan Aber (@ryaber) September 15, 2019\n\nThis comes on the heels of just 36,951 showing up to watch UCLA lose to San Diego State last week. That was the program\u2019s worst home attendance figure in 25 years.\n\nYahoo Sports confirmed earlier in the week that the free tickets given away on Saturday were valued at $280, but as kickoff neared, prime seats at the 50-yard line could be bought for $25 on the secondary market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWho\u2019s to blame for UCLA\u2019s poor attendance?\n\nThe Rose Bowl is a beautiful stadium with a gorgeous view over Pasadena, but it doesn\u2019t seem like fans are interested in sightseeing.\n\nThe Bruins have no one to blame for poor attendance but themselves, although underperforming in a sports market as large as Los Angeles certainly does not help. USC, a program going through its own struggles, still outdraws its crosstown rivals. The NFL has further diluted the local football market with the Rams and Chargers moving into the city.\n\nUCLA has finished under .500 the last three seasons, and it will take a miracle to snap that streak this year. Chip Kelly has done little to live up to his five-year, $20 million contract as head coach. The program has to essentially beg fans to show up to arguably the biggest home game on its schedule \u2014 and look at what happened.\n\nThe only people at the UCLA game are Oklahoma fans pic.twitter.com/9WzebYrtgk \u2014 Jack McGuire (@JackMacCFB) September 15, 2019\n\nIt seems like a fun time to be a Bruins fan.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Rose Bowl is a beautiful stadium, but it doesn\u2019t seem like fans are interested in sightseeing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wultJIUzMXYllt6vA9LBpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5puw9NbNbTv7iqk3SJIqDg--~B/aD0zMzU3O3c9NTAzNTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ab741b00-d7bb-11e9-beff-e6cd4a8a8bc3", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
