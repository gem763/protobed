It is the most complete pterosaur specimen found in Australia; including parts of the skull and five vertebrae and wing elements.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a sight to see,\u201d said Adele Pentland from Swinburne University, the lead author of a study published in the journal Scientific Reports. \u201cIt has a wingspan of about four metres, which is pretty big compared to our modern-day birds.\n\n\u201cEven though we didn\u2019t find the entire skull, we found most of the skull and we also found 40 teeth and two fragments at the site. To see it walking around on the ground it would have walked on four legs and looked really different to any kind of animal we have today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary when you think their heads are disproportionately large, it would have had a skull maybe 60cm.\u201d\n\nPentland said elements of the find had surprised researchers. Based on unique crests on its upper and lower jaw, researchers identified it as genetically close to a previous find in England.\n\nBehind a lesbian furore over a famous palaeontologist lies a deeper truth | Tori Herridge and Becky Wragg Sykes Read more\n\n\u201cWe found out that this pterosaur is more closely related to material which has been found in England [and] that was a bit of a surprise. We are seeing that pattern because they could disperse across the ocean pretty easily.\u201d\n\nThe fossil\u2019s small front teeth and other \u201cunique dental characteristics\u201d distinguish it as a distinct species. It is one of the latest-surviving members of the Anhanguera group.\n\nThe decision to name the species after Lenton honours him as an advocate for outback Queensland and its tourism opportunities, including Winton\u2019s Age of Dinosaurs museum, renewable energy and cultural programs in the bush.", "description": "Pterosaur had four-metre wingspan, lived about 90m years ago and was capable of crossing continents", "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3bdda160ecbed2e014a8c388c8a78a660f61c10/0_58_992_595/master/992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92040357cb576c99ba3713b375370c23"}
