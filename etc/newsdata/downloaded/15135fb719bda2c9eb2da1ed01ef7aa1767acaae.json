The moody black-and-white pic shows the \u201cSay My Name\u201d singer posing on a beach in a straw hat, oversized glasses, and one-piece bathing suit, which shows off her booty in all its natural, unretouched glory.\n\n\u201cWanted to give you a little real nAss on your timeline today,\u201d 30-year-old Rexha wrote in the caption. In true inspirational style, she added the hashtags #BootyByGod and #everbodyisbeautiful.\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve grown to expect from Rexha\u2013\u2013besides candid lyrics and major songwriting abilities\u2013\u2013it\u2019s her style of always keeping it real. She\u2019s been refreshingly open about everything from her sexuality and mental health to body image and how she handles fame.\n\nShe\u2019s never been interested in \u201cplaying the game,\" as she told Health in May. \u201cI\u2019ve just been myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had people tell me, \u2018That\u2019s why you\u2019re not as big as you could be\u2019\u2014which is fine.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also not afraid to show off her body. She did splits in her birthday suit to celebrate turning 30, and shared it with the world via Instagram. But she\u2019s not as confident as she might seem, whatever all those booty shots might suggest. \u201cA lot of times I\u2019ll come off as intimidating,\u201d she told Health. \u201cIt\u2019s usually because I feel nervous and I\u2019m trying to get my anxiety down.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 6 Exercises to Get a Bigger Butt\n\nNot everyone appreciates Rexha\u2019s shape. She shared a super honest video on Instagram earlier this year, which provided an alarming insight into what really goes on behind the scenes during the buildup to high-profile red carpet events. Rexha, who says she typically wears a size 6-8, revealed that a number of designers were unwilling to dress her for the 2019 Grammys because of her size. (She was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.)\n\n\u201c[They\u2019re] saying all the women in the world that are a size 8 and up are not beautiful and that they cannot wear your dresses,\u201d she said in the video. \u201cSo to all the people who said I\u2019m thick and I can\u2019t wear your dress, f\u2014ck you, I don\u2019t want to wear your f\u2014g dresses.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Rexha\u2019s Grammys dress was the biggest \u201cf\u2014k you\u201d to every designer who turned her down. Her red gown by Monsoori, which had a plunging neckline and a long, tiered skirt, was a showstopper.\n\nWhether she\u2019s glamming it up on the red carpet or getting her chill on at the beach, Rexha (and, let\u2019s face it her, butt) always look great. But what really shines through is her down-to-earth body positive attitude. Don\u2019t ever change, Bebe.\n\nTo get our top stories delivered to your inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter", "description": "Once again\u00a0the internet is going bonkers over her backside.", "authors": ["Claire Gillespie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/..4udJ0kQVSqTSE7j7lUGQ--~B/aD0xOTE0O3c9MzQwNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/health_338/59d5dc967329451b3ab2911eee8f8397", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
