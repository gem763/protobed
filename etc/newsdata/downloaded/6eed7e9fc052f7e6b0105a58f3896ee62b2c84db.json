I feel like a piece of crap,\u201d she told the courtroom through sobs. \u201cI hate that I have to live with this every single day of my life. And I ask God for forgiveness, and I hate myself every single day. I feel like I don\u2019t deserve a chance to be with my family and friends. And I wish he was the one with the gun who killed me.\u201d\n\n\"I wish he was the one with the gun that killed me.\"\n\n\n\nAmber Guyger, ex-Dallas police officer accused of killing unarmed man in his apartment, breaks down in tears on the stand as she recounts the night's tragic events. https://t.co/EHJNIYULgM pic.twitter.com/ryoJkObpuF \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 28, 2019\n\nGuyger was arrested in September 2018 and charged with manslaughter after gunning down Botham Jean in his own apartment. However, she was later charged with murder.\n\nIn her testimony, Guyger said the tragedy occurred after she entered the wrong unit after the end of a work shift, believing Jean to be an intruder in her home. Moments before, she had been exchanging sexually explicit text messages with a co-worker on the force.\n\nGuyger said she demanded to see Jean\u2019s hands, then shot him in the chest as he approached her.\n\nProsecutors said he was eating ice cream and watching TV when she showed up that night.\n\nThe senseless killing of Jean, a Black man, by Guyger, a white woman, sparked national outrage over the American epidemic of excessive use of force by police.\n\nHowever, Guyger claimed that her actions were not influenced by race.\n\n\u201cI was scared this person inside my apartment was going to hurt me,\u201d she said, later adding, \u201cThis is not about hate, it\u2019s about being scared that night.\u201d\n\nThough Guyger\u2019s attorneys have argued she was simply caught up in a terrible accident, prosecutors are pointing to the case as an example of negligence, and a police officer who recklessly rushed for her weapon.\n\nThe trial is set to resume Monday, one day after what would have been Jean\u2019s 28th birthday.", "description": "Amber Guyger is charged with murdering Botham Jean in 2018 when she allegedly entered the wrong apartment and mistook him for an intruder.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8fbc3c2200003300deff88.jpeg?cache=oeb4rgg1ln&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
