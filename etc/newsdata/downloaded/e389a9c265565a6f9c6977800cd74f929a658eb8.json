The Duchess of Sussex, 38, also shared an important message to young people around the world.\n\n\u201cI remember being a young girl watching TV and seeing what was happening in the world, and frankly, often feeling despair. Because when you continue and constantly see and hear negativity, it can be overwhelming; you can feel powerless, and lost, you can feel different, confused, or like you don\u2019t belong,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure there is a young girl or boy watching this and thinking the maybe exact same thing. So, this is for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a world that can seem so aggressive, confrontational and dangerous, you should know that you have the power to change it,\u201d Meghan continued. \u201cBecause whether you\u2019re here in South Africa, at home in the U.K. or the U.S., or around the world, you actually have the power within you to change things, and that begins with how you connect to others.\u201d\n\nSamir Hussein/WireImage More\n\nMeghan Markle | Samir Hussein/WireImage More\n\nRELATED: See All the Best Photos from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s Tour of Africa\n\nThe royal mom added, \u201cI have learned from the people I\u2019ve met here, that whether it\u2019s about society\u2019s expectations of masculinity or femininity, or how we divide ourselves by race or faith or class or status \u2014 everyone has value, and everyone deserves to be heard and respected. And if you live your life in that way, your generation will start to value each other in ways the rest of us have not yet been able to do so.\u201d\n\nMeghan Markle | MICHELE SPATARI/AFP via Getty More", "description": "Meghan Markle Wraps Africa Tour with Prince Harry", "authors": ["Stephanie Petit"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/q7pwGLG6m41wg.Lmw5QOkA--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/76b2f6232a4cf73535dc02b8949d98d4"}
