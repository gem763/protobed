Each Friday, The Verge\u2019s Cut the Crap column simplifies the choice by sorting through the overwhelming multitude of movies and TV shows on subscription services, and recommending a single perfect thing to watch this weekend.\n\nWhat to watch\n\n\u201cMorris Day and The Time,\u201d an episode of Mike Judge Presents: Tales from the Tour Bus, an animated documentary series on Cinemax. For two seasons now, Tales from the Tour Bus has collected musicians\u2019 wildest anecdotes about life on the road, playing alongside showbiz legends. Season 1 covered country music stars; season 2 focused on funk. The Morris Day episode is unusual, in that its true subject is really Day\u2019s friend and rival, Prince. Each tale is introduced and narrated by Beavis and Butt-Head / King of the Hill creator Mike Judge, who adds his own personal opinions and analysis, explaining who these performers are and what their music means.\n\nWhy watch now?\n\nBecause Judge\u2019s series Silicon Valley returns Sunday night on HBO.\n\nThis will be the sixth and final season for Silicon Valley, which debuted in 2014 as the story of a socially awkward but innovative coder Richard Hendricks (Thomas Middleditch), who persistently struggles against the oppressive demands of tech giants and the personal weaknesses of his own friends. Over the course of the past five years, Judge and his creative team \u2014 aided by an all-star cast of comic actors, including Martin Starr, Kumail Nanjiani, and Zach Woods \u2014 have commented on the madness of modern business, where genuinely visionary ideas get choked to death by legal snafus and copycats. The show expresses a deep faith in the future of technology, but a skepticism about the people in charge.\n\nThat\u2019s very much in keeping with the worldview expressed in other Judge projects, like the movies Office Space and Idiocracy, and the TV shows Beavis and Butt-Head and King of the Hill. Judge tends to see anyone with power \u2014 however petty and inconsequential the power might be \u2014 as something of a buffoon, inclined to egomania, insensitivity, and a lazy incuriosity about the world outside their sphere of influence. Judge has more sympathy with ordinary schmoes who just want to do a job they believe in for eight to 10 hours a day, then go home and play video games. He doesn\u2019t see these regular folks as heroic. In his films and television shows, the powerless make just as many mistakes as the powerful.\n\nJudge explores an insider / outsider dynamic in a lot of the episodes of Tales from the Tour Bus, which look at stars like Waylon Jennings and James Brown through the eyes of the men and women who spent months and even years playing shows with them around the world, and thus saw them at their weirdest. In the case of the \u201cMorris Day and The Time\u201d episode, Judge and his interview subjects tell the story of a colorful Minneapolis R&B act who became famous thanks to their old pal Prince, who played alongside Day, Jellybean Johnson, Jimmy Jam, and Terry Lewis when they were all starting out on the Twin Cities scene.\n\nPrince produced the band, wrote most of their songs, and took them on the road as his opening act. In interviews with Johnson, Jam, Lewis, and Day, Tales from the Tour Bus reveals that Prince also controlled The Time\u2019s level of individual creativity, and even how popular the band could become. A big part of the story in this episode is about Day risking his career by rebelling against his mentor, and then reconciling with him shortly before Prince\u2019s death.\n\nWho it\u2019s for\n\nFans of King of the Hill and backstage drama.\n\nThe animation is much stiffer in Tales from the Tour Bus than it is in King of the Hill, but the design is similarly flat and cartoony, like something out of an underground comic book. And it\u2019s hard not to hear traces of Hank Hill when Judge narrates \u2014 he played Hill on primetime TV for more than a decade. Judge\u2019s deliberate pace and clipped Texas twang lends a kind of folksy authority to his pronouncements about the heyday of funk in 1984, when the acts who debuted in the late 1970s were suddenly hobnobbing at the Grammys.\n\nJudge also just knows a good story when he hears it. The \u201cMorris Day and The Time\u201d episode gets into the nutty origins of Day\u2019s \u201cmirror dance\u201d routine (as seen in the movie Purple Rain) and his arm movements in the song \u201cThe Bird\u201d (inspired by The Flintstones). The episode also features reminiscences about the days when The Time and Prince\u2019s band The Revolution toured together, and tried to outplay each other every night. This particular tale is about the rich rock star with the state-of-the-art motor coach and the high-end after-show parties, vs. his buddies from the old neighborhood, who hosted debauched orgies after gigs, then piled onto a broken-down bus that always smelled like gasoline. That right there is a Mike Judge kind of contrast.\n\nWhere to see it\n\nCinemax\u2019s Max Go service, or via the Cinemax subscription add-on to Hulu or Amazon Prime. For more Judge, King of the Hill is on Hulu, and Silicon Valley is available via HBO.", "description": "The second season of Mike Judge\u2019s animated Cinemax show Tales from the Tour Bus explored the wild backstory behind famous funk performers.
