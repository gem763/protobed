We don't make exceptions for any pupils.\"\n\nThe girl's father said his daughter had worn the same trousers last year and believed the new policy was too harsh.\n\n\"They were a plain, simple pair of black Marks & Spencer school trousers,\" he told the BBC. \"They weren't fashion. They weren't ankle grabbers.\n\n\"I think she had just slightly outgrown the trousers and they were just a little bit off the top of the shoe. That was enough for her to be singled out and put in isolation for the entirety of Tuesday.\"\n\nImage copyright Google Image caption The George Spencer Academy said trousers had to touch the top of the shoe\n\nHe added: \"I accept rules should be abided by, but the sanctions and punishment have to be appropriate.\n\n\"The blame shouldn't be on the child, it should be with the parents, so why punish the child?\"\n\nThe academy said its new uniform policy states trousers should be a plain style and cover ankles and socks.\n\nThe spokeswoman said the school would be happy to discuss the matter further with the girl's father.\n\nFollow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.
