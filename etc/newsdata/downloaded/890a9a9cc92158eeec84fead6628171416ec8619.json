The Taliban said that would follow a deal on the withdrawal of all foreign forces.\n\nThe Taliban were ready to stand by the tentative agreement struck before Trump cancelled the talks, according to Pakistani officials and sources militant group sources, who said the insurgents were eager to resume negotiations.\n\nTrump too, despite calling off the talks, is keen to end U.S. involvement in Afghanistan, which began weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\n\nThe United States has about 12,000 troops in Afghanistan.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's top negotiator for Afghanistan was in Kabul on Sunday to brief the Afghan president on peace efforts on his first trip back since Trump ended talks with the Taliban aimed at ending America's longest war.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445436259&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q07E", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
