Many are considering early retirement.\n\n'Patients already face overly long waits for operations. Persisting with a tax system that punishes clinicians for taking on extra work, will undoubtedly lead to a further deterioration in waiting times.'\n\nThe Royal College of Surgeons surveyed 1,890 of its members although the organisation represents a total of 25,000 surgeons in England and worldwide.\n\nOne 42-year old trauma and orthopaedic surgeon, who performs procedures such as hip and knee replacements said: 'This is not a story about pensions, it is a story about how long patients will have to wait for surgery.\n\n'My waiting list went from five months to nine months overnight. It is the biggest threat to the NHS at present.'\n\nAnother respondent said: 'It is very sad to see senior consultant colleagues retiring very early from the NHS and junior consultants, including myself, reducing their NHS work significantly.\n\n'Unfortunately, those who will suffer are the patients that rely on the NHS for their treatment.'\n\nThe rules were imposed by George Osborne in April 2016 and anyone earning more than \u00a3110,000 a year will be hit by a tax charge if they put more than \u00a310,000 into their pension pot annually.\n\nPreviously, they could pay up to \u00a340,000 into their pension pot a year tax-free.\n\nMiss Stella Vig, a clinical director at Croydon University Hospital in South London and council member of the Royal College of Surgeons said: 'The NHS pensions scheme has created a 'tax trap', where accepting an extra shift can lead to a large and entirely unpredictable tax bill landing in the post many months later.'\n\nProfessor Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians said: 'We simply cannot wait until the next tax year for a solution, every week the issue remains more hard-working doctors will reduce their hours, driving up waiting times for patients and driving down staff morale.'", "description": "The survey by the Royal College of Surgeons in England and Wales also found that 68 per cent of their members were considering early retirement due to the pensions taxes.", "authors": ["Sophie Borland Health Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/15/20284612-0-image-a-15_1572275693420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
