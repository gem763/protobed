There is the rough shape of the deal to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cAs some of you may have seen, I myself have been to talk to various other EU leaders particularly in Germany, in France and in Ireland, where we made a good deal of progress.\u201d\n\nHis remarks come a day after the U.K. presented a long-awaited plan to EU negotiators on how to replace the controversial Northern Ireland backstop, but diplomats briefed on the Brexit talks say the proposals fall short of the reassurance that Dublin and Brussels need.\n\nJohnson is set to travel to Luxembourg on Monday for Brexit talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the EU Brexit chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Afterwards, he will meet with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg Xavier Bettel.\n\n\u201cWe will talk about the ideas that we\u2019ve been working on and we will see where we get,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nMinutes earlier Johnson was heckled over his decision to prorogue parliament as he delivered a speech on giving extra powers to local leaders in the North of England.\n\nThe heckler, who was removed by security guards, shouted: \u201cLike our MPs? Maybe get back to Parliament. Yeah? Why are you not with them in Parliament sorting out the mess that you have created? Why don\u2019t you sort it out, Boris?\u201d\n\nJohnson replied he was \u201cvery happy to get back to parliament very soon,\u201d adding that \u201cwhat we want to see in this region is towns and communities able to represent that gentlemen and sort out his needs.\u201d\n\nHe insisted that there would be \u201cample time\u201d for parliament to consider the Brexit deal he hopes to strike with the EU in the coming weeks, and accused opposition parties of trying to frustrate Brexit. \u201cThe gentleman who left prematurely \u2014 not necessarily under his own steam \u2014 that is the answer to his question,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nWith his speech, the prime minister sought to focus voters\u2019 attention on his domestic agenda, pledging to spend more public money on education and improving rail connections in the North of England.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to be deterred by anybody from our goal of coming out of the EU on October 31, which I believe many people want us to do ... But also I won\u2019t be deterred from getting on with our domestic agenda,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Johnson visited Doncaster, where he was challenged by a woman who accused him of telling a \u201cfairy tale\u201d by promising more public spending after Brexit.\n\n\u201cPeople have died because of austerity,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got the cheek to come here and tell us austerity is over and it\u2019s all good now, we\u2019re going to leave the EU and everything is going to be great. It\u2019s just a fairy tale,\u201d she said.", "description": "\u2018Get back to parliament,\u2019 a heckler shouted during Johnson\u2019s speech.", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo", "Paul Dallison", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1167766577-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
