Instead, they overwhelmingly support the decisions and pay packages of executives at the companies in their portfolios, including the worst performers, according to a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records.\n\nThe three fund firms, for instance, supported doubling the pay of the chief executive at California utility PG&E Corp after its stock plummeted over potential liability from maintenance problems linked to California wildfires. The funds supported big pay packages for executives at beauty products company Coty Inc - including nearly $500,000 for their children\u2019s tuition - as the company struggled to digest its acquisition of Procter & Gamble\u2019s beauty business. And all three cast pivotal votes against the proposed reform of splitting the CEO and chairman roles at General Electric Co after a decade of poor performance.\n\nSuch votes reflect a larger trend of deference to management, according to an analysis of proxy voting at 300 of the worst-performing companies in the Russell 3000 index, as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018. The analysis was conducted for Reuters by shareholder-voting data firm Proxy Insight.\n\nThe study looked at the 300 worst performers who held proxy votes in 2018. It found that BlackRock voted with management 93% of the time, followed by Vanguard at 91% and State Street at 84% during the proxy year ended June 30, 2018. The analysis showed that the three index fund firms supported management at the worst-performing Russell 3000 firms only slightly less often than they did for all companies in the index, regardless of performance.\n\n\u201cIf we think that informed and engaged shareholders play an important role in disciplining company management, the rise of index investing is a problem,\u201d said Dorothy Lund, a law professor at USC\u2019s Gould School of Law and an author of several published corporate-governance studies.\n\nActively managed funds also routinely support management in proxy ballots. But their voting records are not directly comparable to those of index funds because active managers routinely signal their displeasure with company management by simply dumping a stock or never buying it. Index funds, by contrast, are prevented from active trading by their own rules because they aim to match, rather than beat, the market. They are required to own all the companies in the index they track, such as the Russell 3000 or the S&P 500 - high-flyers and dogs alike.\n\nThat leaves proxy voting as the primary leverage for index funds firms to hold companies accountable for practices that undermine shareholders\u2019 interests, such as exorbitant executive pay. But the index providers face powerful disincentives in confronting management at the companies in their portfolios, industry experts said.\n\nWith no mission to outperform market indices, the funds lack a financial incentive to ensure that portfolio companies are well-run, Lund said. Their business models also rely heavily on recruiting everyday investors away from actively managed mutual funds with the promise of lower fees. And large companies - like the ones in major stock indexes - are key to acquiring new customers for the big fund firms: BlackRock, Vanguard and rival firms count on corporations to offer their funds to employees in retirement plans, which often limit the options workers can select.\n\nThose vital business relationships mean index funds treat their portfolio companies more like clients, Lund said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe problem is going to be greater as these index funds get more money,\u201d she said.\n\nThe index fund firms say they take seriously the watchdog role that institutional investors have historically played in the stock market. Proxy voting, they say, is only a small part of their regular engagement with companies, and they prefer to address problems privately.", "description": "Index funds now control half https://tmsnrt.rs/2Mhmc6L the U.S. stock mutual fund market, giving the biggest funds enormous power to influence decisions and demand better returns at the companies in which they invest trillions of dollars.
