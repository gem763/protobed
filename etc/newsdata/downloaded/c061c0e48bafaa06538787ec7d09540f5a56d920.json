Gen. Darryl Williams, 60th superintendent, U.S. Military Academy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKurita has been missing since Friday around 5:30 p.m. when he failed to report for a scheduled military skills competition.\n\nA massive search ensued with the assistance of West Point Military Police, New York State police, Coast Guard, CSX railroad police, local police, and the 23rd Military Police Company from Fort Drum, N.Y.\n\nWest Point previously said that searchers had covered over 6,000 acres on West Point but efforts were hampered early Tuesday by poor weather conditions.\n\nCol. Cecil Marson, garrison commander of West Point, said in a Tuesday statement that officials believed Kurita was in the vicinity of the military academy because there had been no cell phone or financial activity for 72 hours.\n\nThe school had noted that a M4 rifle was unaccounted for but the cadet was not believed to have had any magazines or ammunition.\n\n\u201cAt this point, there is no indication Kurita poses a threat to the public, but he may be a danger to himself,\u201d the school said in a statement before his body was recovered.\n\nIt is unclear if the rifle has been recovered.", "description": "A 20-year-old West Point cadet who had been missing since Friday was found dead Tuesday night at military academy in New York, the school announced in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/kuritakade_usmilitary_102319.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
