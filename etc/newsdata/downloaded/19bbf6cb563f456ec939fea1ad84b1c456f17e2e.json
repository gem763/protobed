The baby was delivered prematurely at just 6.5 months of pregnancy via caesarean section.\n\nThe woman, who is described as both medically and physically weak as a result of having only one lung, had previously adopted a child but wanted to give birth herself and therefore sought IVF treatment.\n\nShe reportedly gave birth late on Saturday night to a baby girl who was immediately rushed to the ICU of a different hospital to where the mother is being treated.\n\nAlso on rt.com Unexpected news: Male basketball star banned for two years after drug test revealed he was PREGNANT\n\n\u201cThe elderly woman had no child and she had adopted a boy of their relatives but her daughter-in-law used to beat her, after which she decided to give birth to a child of her own,\u201d Dr Abhilasha Kinkar, who facilitated the birth, told the Hindustan Times.\n\nAs is frequently the case in India, the woman\u2019s exact age is not known because older generations do not have official birth certificates which prove their age.\n\nIn September, Erramatti Mangayamma, 73, gave birth to twins via IVF in the south eastern state of Andhra Pradesh, also through a combination of IVF and delivery via C-section.\n\nDoctors claimed at the time that she was the oldest person ever to give birth, though there were some disputes as to her actual age, with some outlets reporting that she was 73 while others said she was 74.\n\nAlso on rt.com Indian PM Modi\u2019s niece ROBBED by motorcycle-riding thieves in New Delhi\n\nWhile the quality and quantity of a woman\u2019s eggs deteriorate over time, their uterus is not subject to the same constraints, making IVF treatment using donor eggs medically possible but ethically questionable.\n\nThe Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine discouraged doctors from \u201cproviding donor oocytes or embryos to women over 55 years of age, even when they have no underlying medical problems,\u201d citing health concerns for mother and child in the short term and the need for \u201cadequate psychosocial supports\u201d to raise the child to adulthood.\n\nThe oldest confirmed mother is reportedly Maria del Carmen Bousada from Spain, who gave birth when she was 66, but sadly died of ovarian cancer just two years later.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
