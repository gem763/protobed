He had been undergoing chemotherapy since it was diagnosed in May.\n\nMan who says he killed 93 women is America's deadliest serial killer, FBI says Read more\n\nThe former road worker was sentenced in 1996 to seven consecutive life sentences for murdering seven backpackers whose bodies were found in makeshift graves in the Belanglo state forest of New South Wales in the 1990s.\n\nAll were killed in horrific circumstances after Milat picked them up hitchhiking: Melbourne couple Deborah Everist, 19, and James Gibson, 19; German traveller Simone Schmidl, 21; German couple Anja Habschied, 20, and Gabor Neugebauer, 21; and British friends Joanne Walters, 22, and Caroline Clarke, 21.\n\nTheir bodies were found covered with branches and leaf litter in the forest between September 1992 and November 1993.\n\nOne victim was decapitated, another shot 10 times in the head. Many were stabbed so savagely their bones were chipped, some had been gagged or bound, and some were suspected of having been sexually assaulted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Milat\u2019s victims, clockwise from top left: Deborah Everest, Anja Habschied, Simone Schmidl, James Gibson, Caroline Clarke, Gabor Neugebauer and Joanne Walters.

A decade ago, he ended a hunger strike days after cutting off his little finger and handing it to prison officers inside an envelope padded with newspaper.\n\nHe severed the finger with a serrated plastic knife and addressed the envelope to the chief justice of the high court.\n\nIn early 2001, Milat swallowed razor blades, paper staples and a tiny metal chain, and then later that year he swallowed part of the flushing mechanism from the toilet in his cell.\n\nHis terrible legacy continued in 2010 when his great-nephew, Matthew Milat, lured a 17-year-old friend into Belanglo and murdered him with an axe.\n\nThe next day, he boasted: \u201cYou know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I did what they do.\u201d", "description": "Road worker was convicted of murdering seven backpackers and burying their bodies in the Belanglo state forest in the early 1990s", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad30cd9a9ac468c51c219489a1111e07e818a37d/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fdb6a35b81d0c63888e0d771c1269251", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
