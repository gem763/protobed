She was placed on the sex offenders' register.\n\nJurors were told the girl eventually confided in a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons.\n\nThe youngster said the abuse happened at a house in East Kilbride, Scotland.\n\nThe witness said: \"She was very quiet, in fact both of the children were quiet and seemed withdrawn which I thought was quite unusual.\n\n\"One night she asked to speak to me and was quite nervous. She said she had a secret to tell me and she told me Samantha used to play with her flower.\n\n\"I was really upset and we both started crying and later she told her dad about what had happened and he got quite angry and upset about it.\"\n\nAnd the woman also told how the boy also told her he was a victim of abuse.\n\nShe continued: \"He told me in 2017 and again he was really quiet and withdrawn.\n\n\"He told me what had happened earlier had also been happening to him.\n\n(Image: East Kilbride News)\n\n\"He ran away after telling us about what had happened and the police got involved then.\"\n\nSmith, from Blantyre, Lanarkshire, told defence advocate Kelly Duling she was innocent and was 'elated' to be in court to clear her name.\n\nShe added: \"I have not done anything wrong.\n\n\"The first I heard about this was when the police came to the house.\n\n\"I'm horrified to be accused of these things.\n\n\"I'm actually elated at the thought of being in court to clear my name over this.\n\n\"I didn't abuse them, I am not some horrible monster that I'm being made out to be here.\"\n\nThe defendant denied any wrongdoing between November 2009 and June 2014.", "description": "Samantha Smith, of Blantyre,\u00a0Lanarkshire, repeatedly preyed on a boy aged five and a three-year-old girl for years", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "David Meikle", "Image", "East Kilbride News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586987.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Samantha_Smith_court_002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
