The book in question was Avengers: The Children\u2019s Crusade, which in one scene showed two fully-clothed men kissing. The gay kiss so upset Rio\u2019s mayor, Marcelo Crivella, who once called homosexuality \u201ca terrible evil\u201d, that he ordered the book to be removed by police in order \u201cto protect children\u201d.\n\nCrivella, a former bishop, belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, which is known for its statements that homosexuals and bisexuals are possessed by a female devil. Crivella has also argued that Hindus hold \u201cunclean spirits\u201d and Catholics are \u201cdemonic\u201d. The evangelical organisation has hundreds of branches and is one of the major forces behind the electoral success of the country\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro. The church\u2019s founder, the billionaire Edir Macedo, by far Brazil\u2019s richest pastor, according to Forbes magazine, claims that \u201cprostitutes, homosexuals and bisexuals are always possessed by pombagiras\u201d, Afro-Brazilian spirits associated with witchcraft.\n\nAs a novelist from Turkey, to me this kind of incendiary rhetoric is eerily familiar. In the name of protecting minors, art and literature are censored, controlled and denigrated by the rising populist right. In Turkey in May, an outbreak of hysteria targeted fiction writers who deal with difficult subjects, such as child abuse and sexual harassment.\n\nArt and literature are \u2013 and will be increasingly \u2013 at the centre of the new culture wars. What might seem like sporadic, disconnected incidents here and there are in truth manifestations of a similar mindset, a growing wave of bigotry.\n\nIn the past 10 years, Turkey has seen an alarming increase in gender-based violence and in the number of child brides. In 2017, the AKP government under President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan approved the contentious \u201cmufti law\u201d, which allows local imams to perform and register marriages. For months, women\u2019s and children\u2019s rights organisations had warned the government that the practice would aggravate unrecorded marriages, including forced marriages of underage girls.\n\nThe Istanbul convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence has been steadily attacked by pro-government circles. The Islamist newspaper Yeni Akit claimed the convention was \u201cdoing the groundwork for the justification of homosexual heresy and the disintegration of the family under the disguise of preventing violence against women..With no improvements for the victims, in August alone, 49 women have been killed in Turkey. Recently, a man who murdered his 19-year-old pregnant wife had his sentence reduced in the courtroom for \u201cgood behaviour\u201d.\n\nInstead of opening shelters for abused women and children and changing patriarchal laws and protecting the victims, the authorities have been investigating fiction writers.\n\nThe suppression of the rights and stories of sexual minorities is an inseparable component of the government\u2019s policy of \u201cpromoting traditional family values\u201d. In November 2017, a ban was introduced on all public events focusing on LGBT rights. In Ankara, a film festival was banned by the governor\u2019s office, which claimed that it went against the \u201ccommunity\u2019s public sensitivity\u201d.\n\nThe escalation of populist right rhetoric often goes hand in hand with a rise in misogyny and homophobia. Works of art and literature are singled out and censored in the name of protecting family values or public sensitivities. Books, graphic novels, art exhibitions, musicals, TV series and cartoons are targeted.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The scene from Avengers: The Children\u2019s Crusade that led Rio\u2019s mayor to ban the comic book.. Photograph: Jim Cheung/Marvel\n\nIn Alabama, \u201ca gay rat wedding\u201d became the source of an unexpected controversy when an animated TV show, Arthur, had to be taken off air because it included a same-sex marriage scene. Elsewhere in the US, a children\u2019s book, And Tango Makes Three, has been banned in schools and libraries. The book is based on a true story of two gay penguins in Central Park Zoo in New York.\n\nWhen it comes to LGBT and women\u2019s rights, extremists on seemingly different sides of the political spectrum can use strikingly similar codes and language. The rhetoric of evangelical rightwing pastors in the US echoes the language of Islamist preachers in the Middle East, who are basically spreading the same messages with different words. Turkey\u2019s head of Ministry of Religious Affairs, Ali Erbas, claims the Pride march \u201cgoes against creation\u201d. He calls same-sex relations \u201cheresy. It is the duty of all of us to educate, raise awareness, and protect our children and young people against deviant understandings.\u201d This year, once again, Pride parades in Istanbul and other cities have been stopped by police using rubber bullets and tear gas. Activists were arrested.\n\nIn Russia, a theatre production, Blues and Pinks, was banned with similar fervour. Human Rights Watch issued a detailed report showing that the \u201cgay propaganda law\u201d , which came into effect in 2013, had a profoundly damaging effect on Russia\u2019s LGBT youth, exacerbating social stigma, harassment and violence against vulnerable minorities. Mental health professionals were also in danger, the report underlined. They \u201cshould not have to look over their shoulders when providing counselling and other services to LGBT youth: they should be free to provide counselling based on evidence and international best practices, not societal fears backed by repressive legislation\u201d.\n\nPoland is experiencing a similar campaign of censorship and a narrowing of the public space. When Warsaw\u2019s mayor said gay rights could be taught in the city\u2019s schools, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, of the Law and Justice party, declared it an \u201cattack on our children\u201d.\n\nIn Hungary, the theatre show Billy Elliot was accused of spreading \u201cgay propaganda\u201d. Faced with abuse and threats, the show had to be closed early. A rightwing newspaper, Figyel\u0151, published a list of academics working in gender or LGBT studies. Another newspaper, Magyar Id\u0151k, wrote: \u201cThe propagation of homosexuality cannot be a national goal when the population is getting older and smaller and our country is threatened by invasion.\u201d Here, as often, anti-LGBT and anti-immigration narratives went together.\n\nIn Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has officially banned gender and women\u2019s studies. A spokesman said the government considered it unacceptable to \u201ctalk about socially constructed genders, rather than biological sexes\u201d. The same approach was voiced at the World Congress of Families, funded by US evangelicals and organised in Verona, and supported by Italy\u2019s former interior minister Matteo Salvini.\n\nIn country after country, we have seen enough examples to understand that a divisive and aggressive rhetoric against LGBT and women\u2019s rights is intrinsic to the rise of populist nationalism and populist authoritarianism.\n\nTop-down censorship and the control of art and literature are inseparable components of the hatred and discrimination against sexual minorities, as well as against immigrants and intellectuals. Artists and writers cannot afford not to know what is happening to colleagues in other parts of the world. We cannot afford to be silent.\n\n\u2022 Elif Shafak is a novelist and political scientist.
