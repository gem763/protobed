We have done them a great service, a great job for all of them,\u201d he said, declaring the US was done fighting others\u2019 wars. \u201cWe\u2019re getting out. Let\u2019s someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand.\u201d\n\nHe promised in future to only deploy American troops into battle when the US\u2019s national interests are at stake, and only when there was a plan to win. \u201cWe will only win,\u201d he said.\n\nHis claims of success bore little resemblance to the reality on the ground, however, and were likely intended for his base at home to whom he had promised an end to \"endless wars\".\n\nThe US president\u2019s announcement came a day after a deal was struck between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin to \"facilitate the removal\" from the border region of Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin receives Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Sochi Credit: Getty More\n\nThe agreement will also see Turkey preserve a so-called \"safe zone\" inside Syria about 75 miles long and 20 miles deep.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defense ministry said that the withdrawal from the buffer zone would mean that there was \u201cno further need to conduct a new operation,\u201d preventing a feared humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nThe deal effectively redraws the map of northern Syria and ends nearly six years of autonomy carved out by the local Kurdish administration.\n\nRussian and allied Syrian government forces began patrolling for the first time yesterday in towns US forces were once stationed.\n\nHumvees bearing Russian flags were filmed driving into Kobane, marking the first pro-regime presence in the area in more than seven years.\n\nThe talks, which took place in Mr Putin\u2019s dacha in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, confirmed Moscow\u2019s position as powerbroker in Syria.\n\n\"The United States has been the Kurds' closest ally in recent years. (But) in the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them,\" Dmitri Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said pointedly on Wednesday. \"Now they (the Americans) prefer to leave the Kurds at the border (with Turkey) and almost force them to fight the Turks.\"", "description": "Russian forces and Syrian troops began deploying along the Turkish border on Wednesday, after striking a deal with Turkey to stave off a large offensive on Kurdish-held Syria. Humvees bearing Russian flags were filmed driving into Kobane - a town considered by the Kurds to be the heart of their territory", "authors": ["Josie Ensor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5tSizN8bm4AgtZVy2IerLA--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_258/a0e705bbd30b062a6ff8ff32a0f9540d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
