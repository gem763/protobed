One drawing shows a veiled woman standing in front of a detention camp with a caption suggesting that Malays who support China's Muslim Uyghurs are radicals.\n\nThe comic was banned under the Printing Presses and Publication Act , meaning that anyone found guilty of printing, importing, producing, publishing, selling or distributing it faces up to three years in prison and a fine of up to 20,000 Malaysian ringgit ($4,775).\n\nMahathir, who has criticized the administration of disgraced former leader Najib Razak for being too close to China, said that \"as much as we do not want the influence of the West in our strategies, in our schools, we also do not want other countries to have undue influence over our young people.\"\n\nAfter coming to power in May, Mahathir cancelled several projects linked to China's Belt and Road initiative, Beijing's sprawling trade and infrastructure megaproject, citing excessive costs.\n\nNot approved\n\nThe comic was distributed in some of the country's high schools last week, quickly going viral and sparking a debate about its content.\n\nOn October 17, Malaysia's Education Ministry stressed in a statement that it had not given approval for the comic's distribution, according to the state-run Bernama news agency . All state education departments and district education offices have been instructed to ensure that schools no longer accept or distribute the comic, it added.\n\nFurther controversy was stirred after a picture emerged showing Chinese President Xi Jinping holding the comic -- with Mahathir looking on -- during the Belt and Road Summit and Forum in Beijing in April.\n\n\"The book was not an official gift during the meeting and it (the comic) was brought in without going through proper procedures and channels,\" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement last week\n\nFollowing the ban on Wednesday, the Home Ministry started seizing the remaining issues still in circulation. It confiscated 13 copies from the Asia Comic Cultural Museum in Georgetown, according to Bernama\n\nJUST WATCHED Malaysia PM: China won't kowtow to US trade demands Replay More Videos ...
