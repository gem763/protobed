Within this short time period, the cryptocurrency has traded at both $7,300 and $10,500 \u2014 a massive weekly range. Right now, BTC is at $9,450, consolidating as it prepares to make its next notable move.\n\nWhile there are many investors expecting the crypto market to continue to mount higher, Bloomberg writes that BTC may not be as bullish as the optimists think the cryptocurrency is.\n\nRelated Reading: Chinese Interest in Bitcoin Remains High Post Crypto Rally According to Data\n\n$10,000 Poses Key Resistance for Bitcoin\n\nIn a recent report, Bloomberg wrote that Bitcoin\u2019s inability to break past $10,000 \u2014 or at least close above that key price point \u2014 indicates \u201ctougher times could lie ahead.\u201d The outlet added that \u201cFor many investors, it will need to meaningfully breach that level for confirmation that the rally could continue, historical pricing patterns suggest.\u201d\n\nShawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade, echoed this line in an interview with Bloomberg. He stated that the fact that $10,000 poses a key psychological barrier for Bitcoin, and will thus need to be broken past to confirm more uptrend.\n\nCruz isn\u2019t the only claiming that Bitcoin isn\u2019t in the clear just yet.\n\nCredible Crypto recently took to Twitter to argue that \u201cbulls [are] jumping the game here a bit.\u201d He remarked that unless BTC clears the $10,300 region, which is an important historical level, there is no need to get too excited. In fact, he went as far as to say that the recent move is \u201cjust a bearish retest,\u201d and that \u201cnew local lows\u201d are still on the table.\n\nAnd an analyst going by \u201c888Velvet\u201d noted that Bitcoin may be trading in a textbook bearish pattern defined by prominent historical technician Richard Wyckoff. As Velvet pointed out, the recent rally, according to Wyckoff\u2019s studies, might just be a \u201cthrowback\u201d to a bull trend before an eventual breakdown, defined as a \u201cmarkdown\u201d by the analyst.\n\nNot So Fast\n\nWhile Bloomberg is writing that Bitcoin investors may have \u201ctougher times\u201d ahead, some have asserted that BTC remains bullish.\n\nAccording to the Independent U.K., CEO of financial advisory deVere Group, Nigel Green, says that he thinks Bitcoin will hit $12,000 by the end of the year, as long as the cryptocurrency remains above $8,500 this week. This would represent a move of 28% if it plays out. Speaking to the outlet, he said, \u201cThe $8,500 support has previously acted as a crucial support for bitcoin. I believe that if bitcoin traders can keep the price above this over the next week, the world\u2019s dominant cryptocurrency will experience a breakout.\u201d\n\nGreen\u2019s analysis is similar to that of Alex Kr\u00fcger. The popular macro and crypto analyst recently remarked that Bitcoin\u2019s chart remains bullish as long as the cryptocurrency remains above the $8,000 to $8,200 region \u2014 some 15% lower than the current price point of $9,300.\n\nHe remarked in an earlier tweet that a loss of the abovementioned region will render the recent Bitcoin bull move \u201cdead,\u201d and thus lead to a continuation \u201clower,\u201d presumably below the multi-month low of $7,300 established late last week.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a remarkable past week in terms of price action.
