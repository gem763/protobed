Tehran rejected the allegations in both cases.\n\nIf the Houthi rebels had deployed the drones from Yemen, they would have to have flown them hundreds of miles.\n\nHowever, one element of the Houthi statement on the attacks did thank \"co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom\".\n\nThe distance from the nearest point on the Yemen border to the closest target, the Khurais oilfield, is about 770km, well beyond the range of the normal Houthi attack drone, the Qatef-1.\n\nHowever, UN investigators have highlighted the existence of a new Houthi drone, the UAV-X, which could reach up to 1,500km.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal has said experts are also investigating whether the attacks could have been carried out from the north - either by Iran or its Shia allies in Iraq - using cruise missiles rather than drones. If so, it seems unlikely they would have escaped detection.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Frank Gardner looks at the evidence the US says proves Iran's involvement in attacks on two tankers in June\n\nOn Sunday, Iraq's Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi denied \"what is circulated on social media networks that its territory was used to attack Saudi oil facilities with drones\".\n\nThe Washington Post newspaper said the US government believed that 15 buildings at Abqaiq had been damaged on the west-northwest sides, not the southern sides facing Yemen.\n\nWhat is Saudi Arabia doing about supplies?\n\nThe Saudis have not gone into any detail about the attacks, barring saying there were no casualties, but have given a few more indications about oil production.\n\nEnergy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said some of the fall in production would be made up by tapping huge storage facilities.\n\nExperts say these could be used for several weeks, although that may well also be the time it takes to get production back to normal.\n\nThe Tadawul All-Shares Index lost 200 points - about 3% - when it opened on Sunday, but had checked the fall to about a 1% loss by mid-afternoon.\n\nWhy would the Houthis attack Saudi Arabia?\n\nYemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels.\n\nThe coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia.\n\nHouthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said on Saturday that operations against Saudi targets would \"only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues\".\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen\n\nHe said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia.", "description": "The US had said that Tehran was behind drone attacks on two Saudi oil sites, not Yemeni rebels.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nbzvx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
