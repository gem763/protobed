I did my best to try & master it, but it wasn\u2019t to be.\n\n'On day 5 we ended up back in hospital because of weight loss & I ended up pumping in between feeds to make sure he put it back on so we could be discharged, then I continued this at home until he reached his birthweight.\n\nHospital trip: Just five days after Rex was born he had to be taken back to hospital because he had lost weight due to issues with feeding, she said\n\n'I then tried to switch to exclusive breastfeeding but whenever I did he lost weight again & It would break my heart to think that my own want to breastfeed was not helping my baby grow so I mix fed.\n\n'As he got bigger his demand for milk got higher & my boobs couldn\u2019t keep up the supply.

I felt like I\u2019d failed & that I\u2019d lost the chance to have that special time & bond with Rex.\n\n'I felt like everyone else was going to feed him & I\u2019d loose my baby. I felt like I should have done more to master it in the first 24 hours & I should have done more research & asked for help.\n\nFamily: The former X Factor star also has children Zachary, 11, with her ex Dean Cox, and Leighton, seven, with her ex Aaron Barham)\n\n'But as time has gone on, I\u2019ve realised the truth.

But the most important thing is he was fed bottle/breast it doesn\u2019t matter. Mamas u really are incredible.
