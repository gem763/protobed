From now on, at least with respect to Chinese totalitarianism, he\u2019ll be dribbling and shutting up.\n\nWatch the two clips below (the first cuts off before he\u2019s done speaking) and you\u2019ll find him making a simple point: Your willingness to speak out about one injustice doesn\u2019t oblige you to speak out about all injustices. He hasn\u2019t always felt that way, but certainly we all have issues that animate us more than others do. That logic is both a sword and a shield for James in his criticism of Daryl Morey. It\u2019s a shield in that it lets LeBron off the hook for holding his tongue about China while criticizing police brutality in the United States. And it\u2019s a sword against Morey, who jeopardized an entire industry\u2019s presence in China for nothing more than a single glib tweet. We might (but probably wouldn\u2019t) be having a different conversation if Morey were an ardent human-rights activist, if he had personal ties to Hong Kong, or so on. One might understand in that case why he felt so strongly about Hong Kongers\u2019 rights that he\u2019d gamble the NBA\u2019s entire Chinese market on making his point. But to just toss off a lone tweet without a second thought? If Morey\u2019s moral investment is limited to nothing more than sporadic slacktivism, it\u2019s hardly worth the financial cost to the NBA to indulge him.\n\nThat is to say, self-interested silence about another\u2019s oppression is a moral weakness but one which we\u2019re all guilty of. We buy cheap Chinese goods knowing full well the cost in human terms. If Morey hadn\u2019t tweeted, how many Americans would have objected to \u2014 or even noticed \u2014 the NBA\u2019s preseason goodwill tour in China?\n\nThe problem with James\u2019s take, as critics left and right have noted, is that he hasn\u2019t observed silence himself this week. Instead of ducking questions, he\u2019s acted as a grubby enforcer of Chinese censorship by criticizing Morey. \u201c[T]here\u2019s an important difference between having nothing to say about Chinese authoritarianism and the nuances of Hong Kong\u2019s limited home-rule, versus reflexively condemning someone who does have something to say on the matter, because those comments f*** with your wallet,\u201d writes Chris Thompson at Deadspin. \u201cIf it\u2019s true that Morey didn\u2019t consider enough the likely consequences of banging out a dipsh*t slogan 10 days ago, then it\u2019s also true that LeBron didn\u2019t consider enough the bedfellow he was taking when he finally came down the mountain.\u201d At NRO, Michael Brendan Dougherty sighs that silence would have been preferable to the sorry spectacle that the NBA made of itself this week:\n\nThere is nothing \u201cmisinformed\u201d about supporting the Hong Kong protestors, and deploring the Chinese Communist Party. China is still a country of forced abortions. It\u2019s a country of open, systematic, state-led ethnic and religious persecution. It\u2019s a country of social censorship. It\u2019s a country of Kafkaesque social policy: millions of Chinese people who were born illegally as second or third children have no right to education or work, and some do not even have their births registered. I think Americans actually would show some understanding and patience with NBA players and personalities that remained discreetly silent. The league\u2019s lucrative involvement in China dates to a time when hopes for China\u2019s liberalization seemed more realistic. And the league\u2019s players may be correct in calculating that any protests against Chinese human-rights abuses from them would not have any salutary effect on China, and could possibly have an adverse one, making Hong Kongers look like subjects of American intrigue rather than genuine interest. But LeBron\u2019s political self-regard, his financial interests, and his silence simply paint a damning picture.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see below, James repeated his insinuation yesterday that Morey was ill-informed about what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong, saying at one point in the clips, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a lot of knowledge about it or quite understand it, I don\u2019t think you should talk about it.\u201d Morey\u2019s tweet may have been glib but there\u2019s no reason to believe he\u2019s misinformed about what\u2019s happening there. Between him and a bunch of self-consciously woke NBA superstars who seem to view China entirely in terms of shoe sales, whom do you suppose is better informed about what Hong Kongers are seeking politically and what they\u2019re up against? There\u2019s a reason Morey tweeted what he did, after all.\n\nWe\u2019re about to encounter this issue of uncomfortable silence versus outright apologetics in a more overtly political context soon, with Trump at the eye of the storm:\n\nChina threatened unspecified \u201cstrong countermeasures\u201d if the U.S. Congress enacts legislation supporting Hong Kong protesters, in a sign of the deepening strain between the world\u2019s two largest economies as they attempt to seal a trade deal. China\u2019s foreign ministry issued the warning Wednesday after the U.S. House passed a package of measures backing a pro-democracy movement that has rocked the former British colony for more than four months. Among them was the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which subjects the city\u2019s special U.S. trading status to annual reviews and provides for sanctions against officials deemed responsible for undermining its \u201cfundamental freedoms and autonomy.\u201d While the legislation must also pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law, it already has strong bipartisan support in the Republican-run upper chamber. The Hong Kong measures were passed by the Democrat-controlled House by unanimous voice votes Tuesday.\n\nCongress is about to pass the legislative equivalent of Morey\u2019s tweet, a toothless but morally righteous statement of support for Hong Kongers. What will Trump do? If he chooses to veto it because it might upset trade negotiations with China, will he defend that a la LeBron by accusing Congress of being \u201cmisinformed\u201d about Hong Kong? A few days ago, after he and China agreed on a \u201cstage one\u201d trade deal, he insisted that \u201cgreat progress has been made by China in Hong Kong\u201d and that \u201cit really has toned down a lot from the initial days of a number of months ago,\u201d even claiming that the standoff with protesters was \u201cgoing to take care of itself.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be hard for him to justify a veto on grounds that, supposedly, there\u2019s no crisis at this point and, even if there is, we need to \u201csee both sides\u201d or whatever. Stay tuned.\n\nI asked LeBron James on his response to the criticism on not speaking out on a freedom of speech/human rights issue.
