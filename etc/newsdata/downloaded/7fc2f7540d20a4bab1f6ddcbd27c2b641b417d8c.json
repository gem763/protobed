(AP) - The Seahawks have re-signed veteran cornerback Jamar Taylor, who was one of Seattle\u2019s final cuts at the end of training camp.\n\nSeattle also released cornerback Parry Nickerson on Tuesday to clear a roster spot for Taylor. Nickerson would seem to be a prime candidate for the practice squad should he clear waivers.\n\nTaylor is likely being brought in as insurance for the secondary because of the uncertainty created by the shoulder injury rookie Ugo Amadi suffered in the season opener. Taylor was signed by Seattle in May and played well throughout the preseason but was one of the final cuts.\n\nCoach Pete Carroll is uncertain about the severity of Amadi\u2019s injury. Amadi started as Seattle\u2019s nickel cornerback in the opening win over Cincinnati.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Seahawks have re-signed veteran cornerback Jamar Taylor, who was one of Seattle's final cuts at the end of training camp.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
