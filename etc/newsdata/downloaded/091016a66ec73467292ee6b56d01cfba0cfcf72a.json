She said, look at it. She handed it to me, and you could see the meat was raw as it could be, pink as it could be.\u201d\n\nA woman in Goodyear, Arizona, says she was a sold a raw chicken sandwich at her local Burger King. (Photo: KPHO via Inside Edition)\n\nParker said when she contacted the restaurant, employees apologized and offered a refund. However, their reaction left a bad a taste in her mouth.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they understood my concern,\u201d she said, according to Inside Edition. \u201cTo me, they seemed very nonchalant. Like, \u2018Oh well, we didn\u2019t cook it long enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nParker\u2019s concerns were amplified because she has another granddaughter with a weakened immune system.\n\n\u201cIf it had been Layla, it could\u2019ve possibly been death,\u201d she said.\n\nBurger King\u2019s corporate offices have since released a statement apologizing for serving the sandwich.\n\n\u201cWe have very strict protocols guiding the cooking process at restaurants, and we take any issue regarding food safety very seriously. The restaurant owner has retrained the restaurant staff on our cooking protocols following this incident,\u201d the statement read. \u201cSeparately, the owner has reached out to the guest to offer a refund and explain the actions the restaurant has taken to ensure this does not happen again.\u201d\n\nHowever, it may not be an isolated incident. At least in Arizona.\n\nPhoenix New Times reports that another woman had a similar experience at a different Burger King last week.\n\nHey @Wendys I know it\u2019s hot in AZ but wanted to tell you this is how @BurgerKing likes to serve sandwiches at one of their locations. My friend\u2019s four-year-old took a bite into raw chicken. You\u2019re just clever and I wanted to share. #wendysforlife pic.twitter.com/MdCg8TO9gI \u2014 Mitzie Lynn (@mitzie_warner) September 20, 2019\n\nAlso on HuffPost\n\nBand-Aid In Chinese Delivery\n\nIn June 2012, a used band-aid was found in ginger chicken.\n\nFinger In Arby's Sandwich\n\nIn May 2012, a Michigan teenager found an unexpected item on his Arby's sandwich: a human finger.\n\nCockroach In McD Hash Brown\n\nIn May 2012, Reddit user LinkBoyJT posted an image Wednesday that might make your skin crawl.
