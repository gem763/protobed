He noted that other countries have been able to take military-style semiautomatic weapons \u201coff the streets\u201d and that the U.S. can\u2019t let the National Rifle Association \u201ctell us what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nAt the New Hampshire Democratic convention on Saturday, former Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke, who\u2019s made buybacks a signature issue in recent weeks, pressed the idea to a cheering crowd that reflected the growing enthusiasm in the party for controlling firearm ownership. He said measures like universal background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws, which his 2020 competitors unanimously support, aren\u2019t enough.\n\n\u2018Politically Difficult\u2019\n\n\u201cWe must go the necessary steps further, as politically difficult as they may be -- a gun registry in this country, licensing for every firearm, and every single one of those AR-15 and AK-47s will be bought back so they\u2019re not on our streets,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 embrace of a forced assault-weapons buyback program shows that segments of the party are throwing caution to the wind on gun control, backing aggressive measures that seemed unthinkable in mainstream circles even a year ago. It comes as the mounting bloodshed from firearms-induced massacres has nudged Americans to favor stricter laws, propelled by a shift among suburban and college-educated voters.\n\nEl Paso\n\nDemocrats\u2019 shift toward gun control comes after its candidates have been largely wiped out in rural areas with a rich gun culture. The party retook the House majority in 2018 midterm elections, driven by gains in affluent and suburban districts. Its previous reliance on rural parts of the country is one reason Democrats didn\u2019t pursue firearm restrictions when they last controlled the White House and Congress in 2009 and 2010.\n\nO\u2019Rourke took up the cause vigorously after a recent mass shooting that killed more than 20 people in his hometown of El Paso, Texas. Before him, U.S. Representative Eric Swalwell of California pushed the idea of mandatory assault weapon buybacks during his short-lived presidential campaign.\n\nImplementing such a program would be a challenge. Swalwell floated jail time for Americans who refuse to sell their weapons, but O\u2019Rourke wouldn\u2019t go that far.\n\n\u201cI would expect Americans to comply with the law,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told reporters on Saturday, saying he has met with owners of AR-15-style weapons who say they would \u201cgladly comply\u201d with a requirement that they give up those guns if it\u2019ll make Americans safer.\n\nO\u2019Rourke said it\u2019s \u201ca great sign\u201d that some of his rivals are coming out for a mandatory buyback of certain guns.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll released Aug. 29 found that 46% of Americans favored a \u201cmandatory buyback of assault weapons, which would mean that people who own assault weapons would be required to turn them in and be compensated with money,\u201d while 49% opposed the idea. In a sharp partisan divide, 71% of Democrats said they support the idea while just 18% of Republicans backed it.\n\nConservative Pushback\n\nThe idea has sparked fierce pushback from conservatives who say it would amount to unconstitutional confiscation of firearms from Americans who obtained them lawfully. It stands no immediate chance of becoming law -- but nor do even modest restrictions, which face opposition from President Donald Trump and the Republican Party.\n\nSeveral Democratic front-runners have also resisted the idea, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who instead favor a voluntary buyback program. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said he \u201cat least\u201d supports a voluntary buyback program and is open to making it mandatory.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to hear the arguments on mandatory, but I at least support a voluntary buyback program,\u201d Castro told reporters on Saturday.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- As mass shootings pile up, several Democratic presidential candidates are embracing mandated \u201cbuybacks\u201d of assault weapons, a proposal that sharpens the political divide on guns and raises the stakes for the 2020 election.
