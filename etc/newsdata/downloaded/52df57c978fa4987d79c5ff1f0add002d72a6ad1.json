Housing is also one of the key campaign issues in the federal election, and the report arrives amid pushback against mortgage stress tests.\n\nThe report said the underwriting changes \u201chave created significant challenges\u201d for prospective homeowners.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, more consumers are now forced to seek mortgage loans from private lenders, often at much higher interest rates,\u201d it said.\n\nOntario\u2019s Progressive Conservative government says it is now considering the report\u2019s recommendations, which also included cutting red tape around commercial mortgage transactions between \u201csophisticated entities,\u201d such as big companies and financial institutions.\n\nThe report recommended reviewing fine maximums as well, as some commenters said \u201c(administrative monetary penalties) that FSRA is permitted to levy under the MBLAA are not high enough for certain offences in order to properly ensure compliance.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne", "description": "Gaining traction in the wake of federally mandated stress tests for uninsured loans", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/private-lender.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
