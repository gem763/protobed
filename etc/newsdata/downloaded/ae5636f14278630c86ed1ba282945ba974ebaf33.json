(Image: CW)\n\nAnd you can watch it. If you want. If that\u2019s something you would like to do.\n\nYou ever meet those people who watch videos of surgeries on YouTube? I\u2019ve known a few, in my day, and only some of them were terrifying. If you\u2019re one of those people, this story might be for you: Ruby Rose, Batwoman herself, has posted a video on her Instagram that shows the back surgery she underwent after herniating two discs during some stunts on the show. Yes, that\u2019s right, she got them to take video of her back surgery. Like, them cutting open her back. With fancy doctor knives.\n\nAccording to Rose, the surgery was an emergency procedure, necessary because without it she was \u201crisking becoming paralysed.\u201d It went well, and all Rose has to show for it is a cool little scar on the back of her neck. Oh, and the video, of course.\n\nThere are a couple takeaways from this. The first is that Ruby Rose is a badass fitting of the role as Batwoman, and that doing your own stunts is extremely impressive and risky. The second is that surgery is terrifying and should not be recorded on video.\n\nWatch this at your own risk. As for me, I\u2019m going to go and scream into a pillow for a little while to work off my anxiety.\n\nBatwoman airs its first episode on the CW on October 7. It does not currently have an Australian release date.", "description": "And you can watch it. If you want.
