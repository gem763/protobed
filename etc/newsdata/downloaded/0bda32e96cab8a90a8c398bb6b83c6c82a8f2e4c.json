Its own market remains a rich source of revenue even though the U.S. business is also shrinking, a trend that may persist for a while, Huang Fanghong, a Hikvision senior vice president, said on an earnings call on Saturday.\n\nHikvision found itself in the cross-hairs of the Trump administration this month after it joined other Chinese companies -- including Huawei Technologies Co. -- on an Entity List that prevents American firms from supplying it with components and software. The seller of video cameras used around the world in surveillance was accused of involvement in human rights violations against Muslim minorities in the far-western region of Xinjiang.\n\nHikvision executives say they had anticipated the action and stockpiled enough key parts to keep operations going for some time. The company has said it didn\u2019t foresee a major impact on its business as a result of the ban.\n\nIn Huawei\u2019s case, for instance, some suppliers including Intel Corp. and Micron Technology Inc. developed workaround solutions to the prohibition. Most of Hikvision\u2019s American suppliers are continuing to do business with it, while abiding by export regulations and without the need for special licenses, according to Huang.\n\n\u201cWe have made a great deal of preparations, from a year ahead of the ban,\u201d said Huang. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to fully discuss the impact from the entity list in 10 days. We need more time to talk to our suppliers and customers. A steady component supply is key in this process, no matter if we decide to use original materials or a replacement design.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. decision, which came on the eve of sensitive trade negotiations, takes President Donald Trump\u2019s economic war against China in a new direction: the first time his administration has cited human rights as a reason for action. It deals a potentially heavy long-term blow against Hikvision, which has steadily switched to Chinese-made components in recent years but still relies on the likes of Intel Corp., ON Semiconductor Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., particularly for higher-end chips.\n\nStill, as much as 80% of Hikvision\u2019s sales are insulated from the U.S. ban, analysts Charles Shum and Simon Chan of Bloomberg Intelligence wrote in an Oct. 8 note.\n\n\u201cHikvision\u2019s sales may continue to rise over the next year despite the Trump administration\u2019s decision,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt can also source alternative parts, though with a weaker performance, from local suppliers in the medium term.\u201d\n\nHikvision reported Friday that net income grew 17% to 3.81 billion yuan ($538 million) in the September quarter, while revenue grew 23%. The company forecast growth of 5% to 20% in net income this year. Its shares are still up 18% this year despite a 5% loss this month.\n\nHikvision was added to the Entity List alongside SenseTime Group Ltd. and Megvii Technology Ltd., two giant enterprises Beijing is counting on to spearhead advances into a revolutionary technology. Hikvision doesn\u2019t play as outsized a role in China\u2019s ambitions but it\u2019s a key partner to Beijing as well as governments around the world. Its cameras are used from Paris to Bangkok and Urumqi, and are considered pivotal to crime prevention as well as helping build \u201csmart cities\u201d or networked urban environments.\n\nLonger term, U.S. sanctions threaten to crimp some of the explosive growth Hikvision has managed this decade, in large part due to China\u2019s effort to put in place the world\u2019s largest surveillance and monitoring network. The company may find itself short of the components it needs to build advanced systems, unless Chinese chipmakers succeed in developing more advanced chips -- another of Beijing\u2019s stated policy ambitions in tech.\n\nThanks to cheap but capable cameras, the Chinese company has enjoyed double-digit growth over the past eight years. Demand for its surveillance cameras, video storage and data analysis services has boomed particularly in its home market. Overseas, the company competes against Canon, Hanwha Techwin and Bosch.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Gao Yuan in Beijing at ygao199@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Edwin Chan at echan273@bloomberg.net, Colum Murphy\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co. warned it may lose customers in overseas markets because of its U.S. blacklisting, underscoring the extent to which curbs on the sale of American technology may hurt the world\u2019s largest video surveillance business.Executives at the Chinese camera", "authors": ["Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/H3h4W7R9eWX1WI9wTJtLMA--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/5f74f4e8465b8f789087e734b42b997f", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
