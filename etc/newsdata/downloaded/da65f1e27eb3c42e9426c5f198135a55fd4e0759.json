He said his replacement would be named next week.\n\nMr McAleenan, 48, is the fourth person to serve as the head of Homeland Security during Mr Trump's tenure.\n\nHe has overseen the president's tough policies aimed at curbing immigration across the Mexican border.\n\nHowever, analysts have described a turbulent relationship between the two and Mr McAleenan has criticised the tone of the immigration debate.\n\nRecently he was shouted off stage by student protesters at a university in Washington DC.\n\nAnnouncing his resignation, Mr Trump said Mr McAleenan had done \"an outstanding job\".\n\n\"We have worked well together with border crossings being way down,\" he said.\n\n\"Kevin now, after many years in government, wants to spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\"\n\nMr McAleenan became acting head of the department after the resignation in April of Kirstjen Nielsen.\n\nPresident Trump had often accused her of not being tough enough on controlling immigration.\n\nDuring the administration of President Barack Obama, Mr McAleenan served as deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\n\nIn 2015, he received the highest civil service award from the then-president.\n\nIn 2018, he faced criticism in the media for carrying out Mr Trump's zero-tolerance policy that led to the controversial separation of families at the US southern border, but he has maintained his agency's duty is to carry out the law, not create it.\n\nEarlier this month, the Washington Post described him as increasingly isolated within the Trump administration and overshadowed by others more vocal in their support for President Trump.\n\nIn an interview, Mr McAleenan lamented not having control over \"the tone, the message, the public face and approach of the department in an increasingly polarised time. That's uncomfortable, as the accountable, senior figure.\"", "description": "Kevin McAleenan was the fourth person to head the agency and oversaw Donald Trump's border policies.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07qq4c1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
