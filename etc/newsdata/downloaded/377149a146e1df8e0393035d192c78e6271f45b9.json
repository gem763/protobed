GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\" wrote the president on Twitter, cautioning people in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.\n\nThe hurricane's exact point of landfall on the East Coast is still uncertain, but the problem is, it appears that Trump was wrong about the pathway of the hurricane.\n\nMore: 'Very, very powerful': Trump briefed on Hurricane Dorian as storm becomes Category 5\n\nMore: Dorian strengthens to Category 5 hurricane with 180 mph winds, targets USA's East Coast\n\nIn addition to Florida - South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated. Looking like one of the largest hurricanes ever. Already category 5. BE CAREFUL! GOD BLESS EVERYONE! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 1, 2019\n\nShortly after Trump's tweet, the Birmingham, Ala., branch of the National Weather Service tweeted to clarify that Alabama was not in the pathway of Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.,\" wrote the NWS. \"We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama.\"\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nThe president quizzed federal officials during a FEMA briefing later Sunday. He repeatedly expressed amazement that a storm could reach Category 5 status.\n\n\"Americans are strong, determined and resilient, and we will support each other. And we will work very hard to minimize whatever the effect of what's coming at us,\" Trump said during the briefing. \"We don't know what's coming at us.\"\n\nContributing: John Fritze\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: NWS appears to correct Trump about Hurricane Dorian's path, Alabama", "description": "\"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian.,\" wrote the NWS. \"We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane Dorian will be felt across Alabama.\"", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png"}
