The demonstrators belonged to Extinction Rebellion, a movement born in the United Kingdom that is committed to nonviolent resistance. In addition to protesting outside of The New York Times, U.S. members have taken to the streets against Amazon in Seattle and NBC in Los Angeles, calling on those organizations to treat the climate crisis with the seriousness it deserves.\n\nIt may seem strange that Extinction Rebellion would target The New York Times, Amazon and NBC, three companies nominally committed to dealing with climate change, as opposed to, say, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News and ExxonMobil, which have abysmal track records on the issue. And it may appear self-defeating to block traffic and mob public spaces, which might alienate potential supporters.\n\nBut organizers say that\u2019s precisely the point.\n\n\u201cWe have finite energy, and spending energy trying to win over the people who are absolutely not going to be won over to your side is peanuts compared to mobilizing the people who would be active or passive supporters,\u201d said Leah Francis, an organizer with the Extinction Rebellion U.S. national team. \u201cWe really want to shift people\u2019s perspective on what constitutes normal, socially acceptable behavior around responding to climate change.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt aims to push governments to make the rapid, large-scale transformation needed to prevent the collapse of human civilization. This means massive, disruptive protests that render climate change too inconvenient to ignore \u2014 protests that will rouse progressives to the cause, even if they turn away centrists or conservatives.\n\nBig green groups, by contrast, have devoted a lot of time and energy to winning over conservatives with the goal of making incremental progress on climate change. Environmental campaigns ask for small donations or push supporters to call their members of congress, always with the promise that change is just around the corner.\n\n\u201cI just want it to be clear that the mainstream environmental movement has been asking very little of people for decades. They\u2019ve been using a strategy of not trying to scare people,\u201d said Bea Ruiz, also an organizer with the U.S. national team. \u201cThere\u2019s no element of, \u2018We are in an emergency. We all need to do more than what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of emphasis on positivity and hope.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2018 United Nations report determined that to stave off catastrophic climate change, humans would need to cut carbon pollution roughly in half by 2030. This would demand a radical overhaul of the global energy system, a shift on a scale unprecedented in human history. By some accounts, the U.N. report was unduly optimistic, spurring Extinction Rebellion to demand countries reach net-zero carbon pollution by 2025. This aim is so ambitious as to be impractical, and politically, it\u2019s unworkable. But organizers are committed to setting their goals based on science, not politics.\n\nGlobal temperature anomalies from 1880\u20132017.

And then we\u2019re trying to be part of helping to change what\u2019s politically possible through direct action,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cWe are really, literally, almost out of time, and if we don\u2019t make the reductions that are needed based on the science, we\u2019re going to be in serious trouble. We can\u2019t negotiate with reality.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion is focused on mobilizing people who are already passionate about climate change, and then working to consolidate progressive support for drastic action.\n\n\u201cThe way you win is by forcing the issue and then asking people, \u2018Which side are you on?\u2019 And we know what side the conservatives are on,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cA significant portion of the country, for example, is evangelicals, who literally believe that, if climate change exists, then it\u2019s God\u2019s will. Civil resistance movements do not win by spending precious time and resources and energy trying to win over people like that. That\u2019s a losing strategy.\u201d\n\nRuiz said organizers were influenced by the work of Harvard University political scientist Erica Chenoweth, who found that when just 3.5% of a population publicly takes part in an opposition movement, that movement succeeds. Chenoweth\u2019s research further showed that only nonviolent movements are able to reach this critical threshold. That\u2019s because nonviolent movements are better able to recruit people, and some of those people will have friends and family who work for the government or news media, or who belong to security forces.\n\nTo be clear, 3.5% is nothing to sneer at. In the United States, that would mean around 11 million people marching, striking or joining sit-ins. For context, the 2017 Women\u2019s March drew an estimated 4 million people, and it was the largest single demonstration in American history. At 11 million people, Extinction Rebellion would be too big and unwieldy for any politician to ignore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrganizers think they will be able to reach that number. Extinction Rebellion U.K. is reportedly the largest civil disobedience movement in modern British history. And coordinators in the United States said their stark message on climate change has attracted a host of new members.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to hear somebody sound the alarm. They\u2019ve all told us over and over and over again that they\u2019re so glad that finally someone is speaking about this crisis in a way that matches reality,\u201d Ruiz said of the people joining their movement.\n\n\u201cMostly what we\u2019re dealing with are people who are just scared, and they are grieving the state of affairs that we have found ourselves in,\u201d Francis said. \u201cPeople have a lot of energy around this, and they want to be able to put it somewhere that matches the intensity of what they\u2019re feeling.\u201d\n\nExtinction Rebellion protests outside The New York Times, June 20, 2019.

Weaver is a new member of Extinction Rebellion, who was stirred to join the movement after learning how little time is left to slash carbon pollution. \u201cI don\u2019t think people are willing to accept that, listen to that, internalize that, be upset about that. They just want to be in denial,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have got to look at it with open eyes and a clear head.\u201d\n\nWeaver spoke to the importance of pushing popular news outlets to routinely inform readers and viewers about the imminent threat of climate change. He recalled watching Walter Cronkite update Americans nightly about the number of casualties in the Vietnam War and seeing the graphs of the body count. \u201cThat image, day after day after day, is indelibly printed on my brain,\u201d he said. \u201cThat sort of emergency coverage is needed [for climate change]. The news needs to lead every single day with it.\u201d\n\nWeaver has come to Extinction Rebellion to find what Ruiz calls the \u201cjoy of resistance.\u201d She said that taking part in the movement can give people an outlet for their anxieties. \u201cExtinction Rebellion is asking people to allow themselves to grieve and then turn that grief and that despair into action,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cWhen you do that, there is a sense of liberation. There is a sense of joy.\u201d\n\nLisa Fithian, another organizer with the U.S. national team, put it more bluntly. \u201cYes, we\u2019re fucked. Yes, this is coming apart,\u201d she said, \u201cWe have to reckon with the grief. We have to reckon with the anger. We have to reckon with the fear. And we have to know that deep inside we actually have power and agency, and we can make a difference.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWhen it\u2019s a fight for your life, you\u2019re willing to throw down, especially if you are doing it in a community together.\u201d\n\nJeremy Deaton writes for Nexus Media, a syndicated newswire covering climate, energy, policy, art and culture.
