Charles Leclerc took four consecutive pole positions in the month of September but could only convert the first two of those, with Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton winning the next two rounds.\n\nFerrari, though, should be delighted with their performance after the summer break, even though it has had its problems. No more so than with Vettel disobeying team orders in Sochi.\n\nWith all that in mind, we look at how the drivers performed in those four grands prix in the bumper September edition of our driver power rankings.\n\nThe rankings are calculated by combining a variety of factors. They take into account the adjusted performance index we used for our ratings last year (where drivers are given a handicap and rating according to their machinery), race and qualifying performance, any penalties a driver receives and our subjective rating out of 100. From this they get a rating and from that we derive our rankings.\n\nSo, who did the business?\n\n10. Daniil Kvyat - Toro Rosso\n\nIt's fair to say September has been a bit of a mess for most of the midfield. Of the drivers below sixth in the standings, only Alexander Albon, Nico Hulkenberg and Lance Stroll completed all four races without retiring. As such, the power rankings look a little odd, with Kvyat ranking in the top 10, despite only one points finish. That was seventh in Belgium, which was a very good result given that on raw pace Toro Rosso had the ninth quickest car.", "description": "Since Formula One returned from its summer break, Ferrari have been the team to beat.", "authors": ["Luke Slater"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/09/30/TELEMMGLPICT000208836201-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq0PK6rQM6QMm_uQOSzVPjFuuGVr62FBJmMRnNXr04hMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
