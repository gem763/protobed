But as tensions between the U.S. and Iran have escalated over the last few weeks, there\u2019s been another, far different voice in the president\u2019s ear: that of Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nA source familiar with the conversations told The Daily Beast that, in recent weeks, the Fox News host has privately advised Trump against taking military action against Iran. And a senior administration official said that during the president\u2019s recent conversations with the Fox primetime host, Carlson has bashed the more \u201chawkish members\u201d of his administration.\n\nWhile some Fox News hosts have argued that a conflict with Iran would be justified, Carlson has consistently criticized U.S. military intervention abroad, particularly in the Middle East. In recent weeks, he has questioned whether war with Iran would be \u201cin anyone\u2019s interest.\u201d Last month, he publicly chided Bolton, saying he was intentionally escalating tensions, and that a potential conflict would \u201cbe like Christmas, Thanksgiving, his birthday wrapped into one.\u201d\n\nDuring a Monday night segment devoted to the recent attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, Carlson invoked the faulty intelligence leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Fox News host compared Pompeo\u2019s \u201cmisplaced certainty\u201d that Iran attacked the tankers to former Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s now-discredited claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still paying a price for that,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nIn May 2018, the Trump administration began rolling out a maximum pressure campaign directed at Iran. Their stated goal was to damage the Iranian economy, limit the government\u2019s ability to fund foreign terrorist groups, and force Iran back to the negotiating table for a second nuclear deal. And in April, the administration rolled out a series of hawkish moves that had made prior administrations blanch: designating Iran\u2019s military as a terrorist organization and instituting sanctions on all Iranian oil exports, no exceptions.\n\nIn response to those moves, U.S. intel officials said, the Iranian government pushed back, causing further escalated tensions. One source familiar with the intel said the chief of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, its military\u2019s covert action arm, had directed proxy fighters in Iraq to prepare for a fight with the United States. Pompeo later directed the evacuation of some civilian U.S. officials from Iraq, though the nature and scope of the threat wasn\u2019t clear.\n\nAnd then came the tanker attacks. Late last week, two oil tankers moving through the Strait of Hormuz\u2014one Norwegian and the other Japanese\u2014were attacked. There were no casualties, and no evidence of oil spills. But the images of smoke pouring out of the sides of the hulking ships shocked the world and sent oil prices soaring. The Trump administration and the British government quickly attributed the attacks to the Iranians. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas initially said that U.S. evidence was \u201cnot enough\u201d to show Iran was responsible for the attack. But Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that there was \u201cstrong evidence\u201d pointing to Iran.\n\nSome Trump allies responded to the tanker attacks with calls for military action. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, told CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan that the moves justify military retaliation.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, took a vastly different tone\u2014less Cotton, more Carlson. In a Time interview published Monday evening, he dismissed the oil tanker attacks, saying, \u201cSo far, it\u2019s been very minor.\u201d\n\nThe president has made no secret of his affinity for Carlson.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has live-tweeted episodes of Tucker Carlson Tonight on at least 20 separate occasions, often promoting or directly quoting the eponymous host or his guests.\n\n\u201cTrump thinks Tucker is one of the sharpest minds on television\u2014[Trump has said], \u2018So smart, a thinking man\u2019s show,\u2019\u201d one knowledgeable source told The Daily Beast in August.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always like this. In a piece Carlson penned for Politico, published in January 2016, the Fox host described a voicemail he recalled receiving from Trump, back in his celebrity-businessman days.\n\n\u201cAbout 15 years ago, I said something nasty on CNN about Donald Trump\u2019s hair,\u201d Carlson wrote. \u201cI can\u2019t now remember the context, assuming there was one. In any case, Trump saw it and left a message the next day. \u2018It\u2019s true you have better hair than I do,\u2019 Trump said matter-of-factly. \u2018But I get more pussy than you do.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cClick,\u201d Carlson wrote.\n\n\u2014Adam Rawnsley and Andrew Kirell contributed reporting.", "description": "As tensions with Iran escalate and his advisers clamor for a hawkish approach, the president has been taking foreign-policy advice from a Fox News host.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Betsy Swan", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Media Reporter", "Political Reporter", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1560911066/190618-tani-carlson-iran-tease_hcrokv", "published_at": "2019-06-19"}
