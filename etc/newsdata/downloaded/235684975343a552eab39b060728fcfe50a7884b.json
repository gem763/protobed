White workers increased their share of good jobs from 50% to 58%. Over the same period, black workers increased their share from 33% to 41%, however, while Latino workers increased their share from 30% to 37%.\n\n\u201cWhite workers are not only more likely to have a good job than their black and Latino peers, but also hold a disproportionate share of good jobs relative to their share of overall employment, while African-Americans and Latinos are under-represented in good jobs,\u201d the joint report concluded. Black and Latino workers are also paid less, despite the same educational attainment.\n\n\u201cThe white surge in college education sets up whites for decades of continued economic dominance,\u201d said Anthony Carnevale, lead author of the report and director of the CEW. He recommended increasing funding for community colleges, investing in retraining of displaced workers, increasing efforts and incentives to promote diversity in education and the workplace.\n\nIn 2016, Caucasian workers held 77% of \u201cgood jobs\u201d \u2014 those pay \u201cfamily-sustaining earnings,\u201d according to the report \u2014 in the U.S., even though they collectively held 69% of all jobs. Black workers held 10% of those jobs, even as they held 13% of all jobs. Latino workers held 13% of \u201cgood jobs,\u201d while they held 18% of all jobs.\n\n\u201cGood jobs\u201d pay a minimum of $35,000 a year for workers between the ages of 25 and 44 and at least $45,000 a year for workers between the ages of 45 and 64. In 2016, \u201cgood jobs\u201d paid median earnings of $56,000 a year for workers without a bachelor\u2019s degree and $75,000 a year for workers with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Overall median annual earnings for all good jobs were $65,000.\n\n\u2018The gender and racial segregation of the U.S. labor market has concentrated women, particularly women of color, in low paying jobs.\u2019\n\nOverall, women\u2019s median earnings are lower than men\u2019s in nearly all occupations, according to separate research released last year by the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, a nonprofit think tank. Last year, the median gender pay gap was 81.8%, reflecting median weekly earnings of $770 for all female full-time workers and $941 per week for men.\n\n\u201cThe highest paid occupations have the biggest gender gaps and the lowest paid occupations that have the smallest gaps, the report found. \u201cAll but one of the ten occupations with the largest gender wage gaps have earnings that are higher than median earnings for all workers.\u201d The occupation with the biggest gender wage gap is personal financial adviser.\n\n\u201cThe gender and racial segregation of the U.S. labor market has concentrated women, particularly women of color, in low paying jobs,\u201d Ariane Hegewisch, program director for employment and earnings at the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research, added. \u201cEven when they do work in high paying occupations, women earn significantly less than men.\u201d\n\nDisparities along ethnic and racial lines begin in kindergarten. A slew of studies over the last decade adds to the body of evidence that a young person\u2019s future prospects may be more dependent on their background than their innate talent. Black students are admonished more than white students for the same behavior, recent research found.\n\nRoughly 30% of low-income kindergartners with high test scores wind up getting a college education and a decent-paying entry-level job, a separate report released by the CEW this year concluded. On the other hand, kindergartners who come from families in the highest-income households and have low test scores have a 70% chance of reaching the same education and job level.", "description": "A report from Georgetown University and JPMorgan Chase says people of color face \u2018discrimination, racism and other injustices.\u2019", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE613_black__ZG_20180228173351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
