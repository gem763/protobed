The knee-jerk reaction is always, \u2018Let\u2019s get everything all in at once,\u2019 but there\u2019s only so much you can move at any one time,\u201d he said.\n\nThe search for victims and survivors went on five days after Dorian slammed the Bahamas with 185 mph (295 kph) winds that obliterated countless homes.\n\nAn array of organizations, countries and companies, including the United Nations, the U.S. government, the British Royal Navy, American Airlines and Royal Caribbean, have mobilized to send in food, water, generators, roof tarps, diapers, flashlights and other supplies. U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the U.S. aid agency has asked the Defense Department to provide heavy-lift cargo planes to fly in supplies.\n\nDames said the runway at the airport on Grand Bahama island had been cleared and was ready for flights. Authorities also said that all ports had been reopened on that island and Abaco, both of which were devastated by the Category 5 storm.\n\nHundreds of desperate storm victims gathered Friday at the port on Grand Abaco in hopes of getting off the devastated island amid signs of rising frustration over the pace of the disaster-relief effort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s chaos here,\u201d said Gee Rolle, a construction worker who waited with his wife for a boat that could take them to the capital, Nassau. \u201cThe government is trying their best, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re doing a good enough job to evacuate the people. It ain\u2019t livable for nobody. Only animals can live here.\u201d\n\nThere were no government-organized evacuations yet, but the Royal Bahamas Defense Force helped people board a 139-foot (42-meter) ferry that came to pick up its employees and had room for an additional 160 people. The crowd waited calmly as marines separated women and children to let them board first.\n\nAlso, a barge that had dropped off portable toilets and heavy equipment in Abaco carried away about 300 other people to Nassau.\n\nPrime Minister Hubert Minnis spoke to the crowd at the port, using a Creole interpreter for a group of Haitians awaiting evacuation. \u201cAll of you will be treated with respect,\u201d he assured them.\n\nMinnis said he was satisfied with the speed of the government\u2019s response and told the storm victims, \u201cAll I need you to do is just be patient and wait because everybody is coming.\u201d\n\nOn Grand Bahama, a long line formed at a cruise ship that had docked to distribute food and water. Among those waiting was Wellisy Taylor, a housewife.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do as Bahamians, we have to band together. If your brother needs sugar, you\u2019re going to have to give him sugar. If you need cream, they\u2019ll have to give you cream,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I grew up. That\u2019s the Bahamas that I know.\u201d", "description": "Search and rescue teams are still trying to reach some Bahamian communities isolated by floodwaters and debris after Hurricane Dorian, while the official...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ876_bah_ap_ZG_20190907091950.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
