And his son Zak Ebrahim, now 36, has turned his back on his terrorist father.\n\nNosair was jailed for shooting dead a right-wing Jewish leader.\n\n(Image: TEDxPorto)\n\nFrom his cell he plotted the 1993 truck bombing of the World Trade Center.\n\nThe attack killed six and injured 1,000. It was a grim rehearsal for the 9/11 \u00adatrocities that took nearly 3,000 lives and flattened the towers.\n\nZak, who was four when his dad took the photo at a park near their home in New Jersey, now helps victims of terror, including a teenage girl who was badly injured in the 2017 Manchester Arena bomb attack.\n\nDespite growing up in the shadow of extremism he said: \u201cI am not my father. I want people to look at me and know they don\u2019t have to choose the path of violence and intolerance.\u201d\n\nZak works with the charity Tuesday\u2019s Children, started after 9/11, which \u00adsupports kids affected by terrorism through counselling, family networks and mentoring.\n\nHe said: \u201cI did a university TED talk for YouTube about my past and last year got an email from a young woman \u00adinvolved in Manchester who had watched it.\n\n\"She told me it had given her hope that things and people could change.\n\n\u201cHer message came at a time when I was feeling quite low myself and I saw it as a gift. We\u2019ve had candid \u00addiscussion about depression and trauma and what effect it\u2019s had on her.\n\n\"She was \u00adinjured and has been through a few surgeries but she\u2019s brave, smart and thoughtful.\u201d\n\nZak became part of the Forgiveness Project charity that tells the real stories of victims and criminals to help people explore ideas of leniency and understanding.\n\nHe has been on a long journey over his dad, often filled with sadness and confusion, which started in the middle of one night in November 1990.\n\nBleary-eyed, seven-year-old Zak, wearing his favourite Teenage Ninja Turtle pyjamas, was woken, along with his siblings, by his mum.\n\nShe claimed their dad had been in an accident and grabbed everything she could carry from drawers and wardrobes. They fled to relatives.\n\nActually Nosair had been arrested for shooting dead Rabbi Meir Kahane, the then-leader of the far-right Jewish Defense League, in a Manhattan hotel.\n\nIt was the start of a nomadic, poverty-stricken life for the now single mum and her kids.\n\nThey moved 20 times in ten years, \u00adinitially to escape death threats from JDL extremists, then later to hide from her own husband.\n\nZak said: \u201cMum had gone from being a teacher with a \u00adhusband who was an \u00adelectrician to being a single mum with no money.\u201d\n\nThe family kept moving and changing their names and Zak was always the new boy bullied at school.\n\nHe did see his dad at the maximum security Attica Correctional Facility in New York while Nosair was awaiting trial.\n\nThe boy looks really happy being pushed by his father on a swing.\n\nEgyptian-born Nosair was acquitted of killing of Rabbi Kahane but jailed for 22 years for attempted murder over the shooting and wounding of a postal \u00adworker during the attack.\n\nAfter the 1993 plot he admitted shooting Kahane.\n\nZak recalled the arrest came out of the blue and his mum had been shocked.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe were a strict religious family and went to the mosque but Dad was just an \u00adordinary dad to me. I recall he was kind and humorous man who had lots of friends that I called uncle.\u201d\n\nBut a few months before the killing Zak had a hint of his dad\u2019s dark truth.\n\nThe boy\u2019s \u201cuncles\u201d took him to a shooting range on Long Island and when he luckily hit a bullseye one man turned to another and in Arabic said: \u201cLike father, like son.\u201d\n\nNosair had also \u00adthreatened to leave his family to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan until Zak\u2019s grandfather threatened to \u00addisown him if he \u00adabandoned his wife and children.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nAt first Nosair\u2019s family mounted appeals against his conviction but any hope Zak had of his dad\u2019s \u00adrelease ended in February 1993 with the bombing of the World Trade Center\u2019s North Tower.\n\nA month before the blast Nosair was visited by Mohammed Salameh, who would be \u00adconvicted of the bombing.\n\nThe day after the attack Nosair phoned Salameh who was driving the van loaded with explosives.\n\nFBI agents also recovered up to 30 letters and documents from Attica linking Nosair to the terror cell.\n\nIt emerged during the trial al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden had helped pay for his defence team.\n\nNosair was given a life sentence and, away from her husband\u2019s strict religious influence, Zak\u2019s mother started \u00adreducing family visits.\n\nThey \u00adeventually stopped. By 16 Zak was questioning the hatred his father had fostered.\n\nZak said: \u201cI grew up believing Jewish were evil, that gay people were evil. Mum turned to me one day and said \u2018I\u2019m tired of hating.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat was the day the world became a brighter place. It was like she was giving me \u00adpermission to go out and explore the world without hatred.\u201d\n\nZak\u2019s mum changed her name and has since remarried. While he doesn\u2019t want to give away details for fear of reprisals he says both she and his older sister and younger \u00adbrother are \u201cdoing fine\u201d.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nZak last heard from his father through prison email in 2013.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy dad wanted to make contact. I was shocked. I wanted to ask him why he chose the path he did, if he regretted it.\u201d\n\nBut Zak failed to get answers \u2013 and believes his father was trying to radicalise him.\n\nHe said: \u201cMy father became fixated that I was no longer Muslim. I told him I\u2019d suffered depression and instability because of what he\u2019d done. He said if I returned to Islam all the problems would go away. I ended communication.\u201d\n\nZak thinks isolation and failure play a major part in radicalisation. His dad had been wrongly accused of a sexual assault within his Muslim \u00adcommunity in Pittsburgh, then moved to New Jersey.\n\nThen an \u00adelectrical \u00adaccident at work left him without a job in the five years before his first conviction.\n\nZak now wants to set up a global charity to bring \u00addifferent communities \u00adtogether through art and education.\n\nHe said: \u201cPeople can turn away from \u00adextremism and I\u2019m proof of that.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Despite growing up in the shadow of extremism with a notorious terrorist for a father, Zak Ibrahim's path is completely different, now working with charity Tuesday\u2019s Children, which supports kids affected by terrorism", "authors": ["Grace Macaskill", "Image", "Tedxporto", "Afp Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20729977.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Zak02.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
