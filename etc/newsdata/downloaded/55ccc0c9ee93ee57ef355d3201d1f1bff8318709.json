Topshop is currently offering 30% off all full-price jackets, while there are plenty of voucher codes running online for additional reductions.\n\nThinking about buying gift cards as presents?

Natwest, HSBC and Lloyds are all running deals.\n\nMonday 23 December\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nIt's Super Saturday, the biggest shopping day before Christmas, when Brits last year spent around \u00a31.6billion and retailers slashed prices by up to 75%.\n\nSome stores will start their Boxing Day sales tomorrow \u2013 two days early.
