That inflammatory language includes, of course, frequent comments from the president himself.\n\nThe demonstration Mr Dempsey allegedly attacked was organised by an anti-Trump group called Refuse Fascism, which had partnered with the Revolutionary Communist Party and other groups since 2016 to conduct nonviolent protests.\n\nRefuse Fascism pushes for the removal of Mr Trump from office, alongside the rest of Mr Trump\u2019s highest government figures.\n\nPolice told the Los Angeles Times that the Trump supports had followed the Refuse Fascism demonstrators on Sunday as they advocated for the removal of Mr Trump.\n\nThey then exchanged insults for about 10 minutes, before they began shoving and screaming.\n\n\u201cEverything went to crap,\u201d D Hicks, a Santa Monica Police sergeant who did not disclose his full name to the newspaper, said.\n\nA post by the Revolutionary Communist Party indicated that \u201cat least 10 other people got directly pepper sprayed in the face.\u201d One individual can be seen on camera being sprayed in the face by Mr Dempsey, as he is held on the ground by two other pro-Trump demonstrators.\n\nMr Dempsey has contended that he and the others were attacked first.", "description": "A man wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat has been charged with a felony after misting protesters in Southern California with bear repellant.
