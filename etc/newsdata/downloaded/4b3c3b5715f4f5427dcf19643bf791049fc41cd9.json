They also said they\u2019re expected to work when they\u2019re sick, meet goals by working overtime, and can be verbally or physically abused if they leave work early or break any rules.\n\nSome people also told the outlet that they earn as little as $106 per month, which is less than the cost of some pairs of Lululemon leggings.

Lululemon\u2019s website reiterates this message.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t own our manufacturing facilities, so we take great care selecting our manufacturing partners,\u201d Lululemon\u2019s website says. \u201cOur approach is to build relationships with factories that are aligned with our values and meet our sourcing expectations.\u201d\n\ncaption A screenshot of Lululemon\u2019s website. source Lululemon\n\nRead more: I used to shop for clothes exclusively at Forever 21.

We require that all vendors share our values and uphold a consistent set of policies that live up to our Code.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not tolerate any violation of this code,\u201d the representative continued. \u201cUpon learning of the reports about a facility in Bangladesh, we immediately launched an investigation.

According to The Globe and Mail, Lululemon also faced criticism in 2013 for selling shoddy garments.\n\nSpecifically, the brand was forced to remove its signature black pants from stores amidst complaints that they were too sheer.
