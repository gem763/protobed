Rather, the company wants to be the supplier of the hardware and cell lines that anyone would need to become a manufacturer of lab-grown meat.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s not much different to the approach that Tyson Foods \u2014 an investor in Future Meat through its venture capital arm \u2014 has taken with farmers. Tyson contracts with poultry farmers to raise the chickens that the company slaughters and processes, and provides them with the means to raise the chickens for slaughter.\n\nThe secret to Future Meat\u2019s success is its use of undifferentiated fibroblast cells that can be triggered with small molecules to turn into either fat cells or muscle cells. Once the fat and muscle starts growing, they\u2019re placed in a culture with a specific resin that removes waste materials that have been an impediment to growth at large scales, according to chief science officer and founder Yaakov Nahmias.\n\nWhile Future Meat doesn\u2019t rely on fetal bovine serum to grow its meat products, it does use small molecules derived from CHO cells (Chinese hamster ovaries), which are used in new medical research and drug manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe have a specific resin to remove the toxins from the media and that allows the cells to continue to grow,\u201d says Nahmias. \u201cIt is essentially a new bioreactor design\u2026 you can increase the yield to 80%.. For every liter of medium you don\u2019t get 100 grams of biomass you can get 800 grams of biomass\u2026 [and] you don\u2019t talk about mega $100 million factories.\u201d\n\nNahmias says using a refrigerator-sized bioreactor, a manufacturer could get about half a ton of meat and fat in about 14 days. In about one month, growers can make an amount of meat equivalent of two cows\u2019 worth of meat (a cow takes about 12 to 18 months to raise for slaughter).\n\nThe former Hebrew University of Jerusalem professor first began thinking about the lab-grown meat business while on sabbatical. \u201cIt was at a Peet\u2019s Coffee right next to the Charles River in Cambridge,\u201d Nahmias recalled. \u201cSomebody asked me what I thought about cultured meat\u2026 They asked me what I thought about it and I told them it was the stupidest idea I had ever heard in my entire life.\u201d\n\nGrowing cells is expensive, Nahmias said at the time, and the fact that the organisms basically grow in their own excrement means that they can\u2019t reproduce effectively to reach any kind of large scale. That\u2019s when Nahmias had his \u201cEureka\u201d moment. \u201cYou need cells that grow without any growth factor at all,\u201d says Nahmias. \u201cThe only cells that can do that are the least differentiated cells, which are fibroblasts.\u201d\n\nWith the new financing from investors \u2014 including S2G Ventures, a Chicago-based venture firm (and an early investor in Beyond Meat); Emerald Technology Ventures, a Swiss investment firm; Tyson Ventures (one of the most active strategic investors); and Bits x Bites (a Chinese investor in food and agriculture startups) \u2014 Future Meat can now test its business model and manufacturing capabilities at scale.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either growing fat or you\u2019re growing muscle of a specific species,\u201d says Nahmias. \u201cImagine a large truck going to that facility. [It\u2019s] replacing the meat packing plant. From there the biomass goes through a process like extrusion. You can have thousands of these mass producing units. [It\u2019s] going to a central facility where the meat comes out at the end. What we are doing is looking for parity and cost.\u201d\n\nFor Nahmias, the fat\u2019s the thing that brings the flavor for everything. \u201cThe fat gives you the aroma and the distinct flavor of meat,\u201d says Nahmias. \u201cThis is the missing ingredient in Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat .\u201d\n\nNahmias envisions products that are made using a combination of Future Meat\u2019s lab-grown products and plant proteins that can approximate the full flavors of beef, chicken or lamb (all meats that the company says it is working with).\n\nAll Nahmias wants is for Future Meat to get to market; the founder doesn\u2019t care whether that\u2019s under Tyson\u2019s brand or anyone else\u2019s. \u201cI want to be the largest company you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d says Nahmias. \u201cI want to make a product that is more sustainable and more cost-efficient, and is better for everybody.\u201d\n\nLike all of the other companies pursuing alternatives to animal husbandry, Future Meat, which was only founded last year, has a mission to reduce the environmental impact of meat eating. The company argues that its manufacturing model will reduce land use by 99% and emit 80% less greenhouse gas than traditional meat production.\n\n\u201cThis continues our investment in Future Meat Technologies, which is focused on disruptive technologies related to our core business,\u201d said Amy Tu, president of Tyson Ventures, in a statement. \u201cWe are broadening our exposure to alternative ways of producing protein to feed a growing world population.\u201d\n\nUltimately the goal is getting to cost parity with regular beef. The company thinks a hybrid product could be $3 to $4, while the 100% biomass product would be roughly $10.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking a yes and \u2018Yes and\u2019 as opposed to an either-or approach to the space,\u201d says Matthew Walker, a managing director at S2G Ventures. \u201cYou will have animal-based meat, plant-based meat and you will have hybrid products. It\u2019s more about the supply chain and the technological products that would bring this product to market. We think there\u2019s room in the market for somebody to play that role.\u201d\n\nNahmias and Kshuk think that\u2019s the role Future Meat Technologies was born to play.", "description": "Are consumers ready for meat grown in a lab?
