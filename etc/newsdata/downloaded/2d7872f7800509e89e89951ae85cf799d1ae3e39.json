However, many of his fellow tyrants considered him both a friend and ally.\n\nAs noted by Breitbart News, Mugabe\u2019s 40-year leadership of the former British colony was \u201cmarked with bloodshed, persecution of political opponents, and vote-rigging on an industrial scale.\u201d He also plunged the country, once one of the wealthiest in Africa, into an unprecedented economic disaster so severe that the government was forced to introduce a trillion-dollar note.\n\nAs it became clear to Western democracies that Mugabe was not the great colonial liberator he once promised to be, his country faced increasing international and economic isolation. However, Mugabe still managed to build relationships with some of the other most repressive regimes on earth.\n\nXi Jinping\n\nThe Chinese leader welcomed Mugabe to Beijing in 2011, describing him as an \u201cold friend\u201d of China and the \u201cfamed leader of the national liberation movement in Africa.\u201d\n\nXi, who was at the time China\u2019s vice president, outlined plans to expand farming, mining, and infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, a pledge he has since aggressively followed through as Beijing seeks to dominate the African continent through economic investment.\n\nAyatollah Khamenei\n\nThe Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei welcomed Mugabe to Tehran in 2012, praising his \u201cbrilliant record in fighting the western arrogant powers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAround 25 years ago, when I was in Harare to attend the summit of the Non-Aligned Movement, you stressed with the same revolutionary spirit that the member states of the movement only talk and that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the only country that acts,\u201d Khamenei said at the time. \u201cAnd now an opportunity has been provided for us to cooperate with each other and guide and call all the member states to taking action.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Mugabe decried it as \u201cextremely ridiculous that Westerners accuse Iran of trying to acquire nuclear weapons.\u201d Four years later, Iran would sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement brokered by Barack Obama and other Western states in which the regime promised it would curb its development of nuclear weapons in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.\n\nThe Kim Dynasty\n\nAfter assuming power in 1980, Mugabe struck up a rapport with communist dictator Kim Il-Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong-un who founded the modern Stalinist state. The pair reached an agreement where Pyongyang would train a wing of the Zimbabwean army, known as the Fifth Brigade, which Mugabe sought complete control as part of his bid to consolidate power in the country. The Fifth Brigade was responsible for the Gukurahundi genocide of the Ndebele people, which is believed to have resulted in at least 20,000 deaths.\n\nIn 2010, Mugabe sparked international outrage from animal welfare advocates and conservationists after sending a range of wild animals, including baby elephants too young to leave their mothers, to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il as a gift. As noted by ABC, the animals \u201cfaced almost certain death\u201d as a result of trauma and the regime\u2019s inability to fulfill their basic needs.\n\nCastro\u2019s Cuba\n\nWith the Castro regime long interested in pursuing relationships with African countries such as South Africa and Angola, Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe was also a close ally of the regime. In 2007, state propaganda outlet Granma announced Cuba\u2019s \u201csolidarity with the people and government of Zimbabwe, the support for its struggle in defense of the most sacred and inalienable rights, and the absolute rejection of attempts to isolate that African country.\u201d\n\nThen-Vice President of Zimbabwe Joyce Teurai Ropa Mujuru \u201cwished health and long life to Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, brother of struggles and dreams of President Mugabe.\u201d Mugabe would end up outliving Fidel Castro by nearly three years.\n\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez\n\nIn 2004, the late socialist dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez praised Mugabe as a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d during a visit to Caracas, bestowing him with a replica of South American independence hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar\u2019s sword.\n\n\u201cFor you, who like Bolivar, took up arms to liberate your people. For you, who like Bolivar, are and will always be a true freedom fighter,\u201d Ch\u00e1vez said. \u201cHe continues, alongside his people, to confront the pretensions of new imperialists.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, observers have drawn comparisons of Venezuela and Zimbabwe\u2019s economic predicament, with both countries suffering similar problems such as shortages, hyperinflation, and the shame of having been transformed from prosperous and resource-rich countries to two of the world\u2019s poorest nations.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "The death of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe aged 95 has come as a relief to freedom fighters around the world.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/05/zimbabwe-president-robert-mugabe-4-17-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
