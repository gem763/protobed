She has had her fair share of trials and tribulations on her journey to success. In her memoir, Bassie: My Journey of Hope, the former beauty queen is vulnerable as she pours her heart out.\n\n\n\nAs public figures, we also go through struggles and deal with pain in our silence Basetsana Kumalo\n\n\u201cAs public figures, we also go through struggles and deal with pain in our silence. When I turned 40, I kept a journal and recorded thoughts and recollections on my dictaphone. But I wasn\u2019t ready to release my book then,\u201d she told City Press.\n\n\n\nShe described writing her memoir as a \u201ccathartic and healing process\u201d for her. This year marks 25 years since she was crowned Miss SA in 1994, instantly becoming a public figure. \u201cI also turned 45 [this year].\n\nThis is important for me and the reason I wrote my memoir. It\u2019s a gift to myself. \u201cIn this memoir I am vulnerable and I speak my truth. There is nothing left unsaid and the moments are so raw in their truth,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\u2018My first boyfriend Dingaan physically abused me\u2019\n\nKumalo had just being crowned Miss SA when she met her boyfriend, former super middleweight boxing champion Dingaan Thobela.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m talking about the abuse I suffered at the hands of my first boyfriend Dingaan. I was celebrated publicly but privately I had an abusive boyfriend who physically assaulted me more than once. But I was ashamed of coming out because the society would judge me. It was a very hard time in my life. Sometimes I was living a lie, pretending that my relationship was perfect. But I knew it was far from being perfect,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nI was bleeding and hysterical and I ended up in hospital Basetsana Kumalo\n\nShe recalled one incident she would never forget. \u201cOne day he hit me twice with a back-fisted hand that had a big ring on it. My head hit the headrest so hard. I was bleeding and hysterical and I ended up in hospital.\u201d\n\nBut she said she had to lie about the incident, saying she was mugged. A few weeks later, she had already made up her mind that she wanted out but Thobela would not entertain that.\n\n\n\n\u201cInstead, he pulled out a gun and put it to my head threatening that he would kill me if I ever tried to leave him. But from that day I knew it was time to walk away,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nHowever, on Friday Thobela denied ever beating Kumalo, saying the story was fabricated. \u201cFirst of all, she is lying. I am not her first boyfriend,\u201d said a fuming Thobela.\n\n\n\nHe said when he wrote his autography, Rose of Soweto, he offered Kumalo a chance to tell her side of the story but she turned down the offer. \u201cBefore I wrote my biography I went to a consultant with her to give her version of the story but she declined,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t remember laying my hands on her former super middleweight boxing champion Dingaan Thobela\n\nHe said it was sad that Kumalo did not talk about his contribution to her life in her book. \u201cI was hoping she would bring the positive side of me. Like any other relationship, we had our own disagreements but I don\u2019t remember laying my hands on her. Did she show you the pictures of the beatings?\u201d\n\n\n\nKumalo said that it was when she looked at the pictures of her beatings she found in her journal, that she said to herself: \u201cI\u2019m glad I left.\u201d Kumalo said at first she was ashamed to speak out about her abuse because she felt no one was going to believe her but she eventually confided in her family. She said she was fortunate that when she left Thobela she was financially independent.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe reality is that when women are not economically empowered and independent they stay in abusive relationships. But when we are independent we make better choices for ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u2018Depression is a silent killer\u2019\n\nIn 2008 Kumalo found out she was expecting twins. She was excited to be a mother again as her first child, Nkosinathi, was almost three years old. But one day she woke up and she wasn\u2019t feeling well. It turned out the amniotic sac had ruptured and the twins didn\u2019t survive.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had already bonded with my babies, felt their moves but things didn\u2019t go the way I had planned. I went through a severe depression after losing my babies.\u201d She described depression as a silent killer, which is seen in communities as a taboo.\n\n\n\nI was literally wailing and my keyboard stopped working because it was soaked [with tears]\n\n\u201cIt was the [most] painful experience that you don\u2019t wish anybody could go through,\u201d said an emotional Kumalo, adding that writing this part was really hard.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was sitting in my study room at 3am. I was literally wailing and my keyboard stopped working because it was soaked [with tears]. I [re]visited places in my life that I never wanted to go [to].\u201d She said she tried therapy and a therapist wanted to put her on antidepressants but she refused.\n\n\n\n\u201cI had a strong feeling that I had to work through this pain so that I could get to the other side. \u201cBut I was not alone, ubab\u2019 Kumalo [her husband Romeo] and my siblings were there for me. \u201cMy sister, Lerato, carried me through that time. She would arrive and order me out of bed and run me a shower. She\u2019d put me in a robe and comb my hair.\u201d\n\n\n\nStalker of note\n\nIn 2003, Kumalo had a secret admirer called Rakawu Joseph Bokaba but he was not a harmless stalker like Kumalo had before. He was obsessed with her and said he would do anything to be her husband.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt all started with him sending letters, faxes. What started as something strange and unsettling soon became shocking and scary. The letters became more frequently and urgent. I feared for my life.\u201d\n\n\n\nBokaba went as far as falsely claiming that he had spoken to Kumalo\u2019s father Philip Makgalemele to arrange lobolo negotiations. Even after she had laid a complaint with the police, Bokaba did not stop stalking her. He became more threatening, not to only to Kumalo, but also to her family and colleagues.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe went as far as sleeping at the petrol station down the road from my home, hoping he would catch a glimpse of me getting petrol,\u201d she said. Two years later, she applied for a preliminary protection order.\n\n\n\nThe police later tracked Bokaba down in Mamelodi, Pretoria, where he lived with his mother. \u201cHis entire room was covered wall-to-wall with every single picture and article that had been published of me.\u201d She later found out that Bokaba had been in a horrific accident in 1991, which left him with amnesia and epilepsy.\n\n\n\n\u2018The importance of entrepreneurship and mentorship\u2019\n\n\n\nKumalo said by the time she was 20 she was self-employed and she wanted to instil the same spirit in talented young people. She believes they can be whatever they want to be.\n\n\n\n\u201cEntrepreneurship runs in my veins. I was raised by parents who were hustlers and they taught me to work hard and to be my own boss.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe also highlighted the importance of mentorship because it has shaped her into the woman she is today. \u201cI\u2019ve always encouraged people to have mentorship [programmes] in any field of business. This is because I have also stood on the shoulders of giants, such as the late ubab\u2019 Madiba and mama Gra\u00e7a Machel. They both contributed so much to my success and this is the reason why I mentor young people,\u201d Kumalo said.\n\n\n\nThe businesswoman said her book has helped her to bury the dark memories in her life.\n\n\n\n\u201cFrom this memoir I want people to learn the spirit of optimism, [I want] to inspire and give young people hope and [encourage them] not to give up on their dreams. My story is the story of survival.\u201d\n\nThe memoir will be launched on Thursday.
