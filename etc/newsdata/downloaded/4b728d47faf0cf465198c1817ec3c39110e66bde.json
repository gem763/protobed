A core challenge, however, is that Johnson's political opponents have said they will not vote for an election until the Brexit extension is decided and a new deadline set for the U.K.'s departure.\n\nThe extension to the Brexit deadline will be conditional on the U.K. not acting to \u201cjeopardize\u201d the EU\u2019s objectives.\n\nIt was not clear that the statements from Brussels \u2014 declaring an extension would be given but not yet saying for how long \u2014 would be sufficient to help Johnson secure the two-thirds majority needed to approve a general election on December 12.\n\nEU diplomats also agreed that their decision would ultimately be made using a written procedure to avoid the need for heads of state and government to reconvene for another summit in Brussels next week.\n\n\"The meeting was constructive,\" a senior EU official said. \"There was full agreement on the need for an extension. There was full agreement to reach a unanimous, consensual EU27 decision. And there was full agreement to aim to take the decision by written procedure.\"\n\n\"President Tusk has no intention to convene a special [summit],\" the official said. \"Work will continue over the weekend.\"\n\nA senior diplomat, confirming the outcome, said: \u201cDecision to be taken on Monday and intention is to have it done by written procedure.\"\n\nAnother diplomat said the meeting Friday lasted two hours and that there was consensus that an extension of some sort would be decided early next week. \"Talks on the length of the extension will continue at the beginning of next week,\" the second diplomat said, \"also in light of developments in London.\"\n\nA third diplomat said: \"We all agreed on an extension but there was not full agreement on the duration.\"\n\nThe extension to the Brexit deadline will be conditional on the U.K. not acting to \u201cjeopardize\u201d the EU\u2019s objectives and decision-making process, according to a seven-page draft decision discussed by ambassadors and seen by POLITICO. It also includes a provision stating that the U.K. should not use the delay for any effort to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nThat condition is identical to language included when the EU last granted a postponement, and in the meantime the Withdrawal Agreement was revised to include an entirely new protocol on Ireland.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service: Pro Energy and Climate.
