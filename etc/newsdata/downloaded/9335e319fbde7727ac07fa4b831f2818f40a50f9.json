The day of Ticketmaster\u2019s presale for Taylor Swift\u2019s upcoming Reputation tour, one fan wrote on Tumblr, \u201cWhen I die[,] I want Ticketmaster Verified Fan to lower me into my grave so they can let me down one last time.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment that was liked or reblogged by more than 1,000 others.\n\nVerified Fan is a major piece of fandom outreach by Ticketmaster, once one of the most maligned corporations in the world, and this isn\u2019t exactly the sentiment it\u2019s meant to engender.\n\nIt\u2019s a recent innovation by the ticket-selling giant, and David Marcus, an executive vice president and the head of music for Ticketmaster, explained it to The Verge in a phone call as \u201ca very simple platform.\u201d Fans register with their email address well in advance of a presale and wait to be offered a code that they can use to get into the sale during a special fans-only window. He calls the engine behind the platform a \u201cbehavior predictor,\u201d which offers codes only to people on the list who seem likely to use a ticket rather than resell it. Not everyone who registers is verified as a genuine fan; not everyone who\u2019s verified gets a code; a code doesn\u2019t guarantee a ticket. This internet-age approach is oddly similar to methods used for the first arena shows in the 1970s, when fans mailed in their names to express interest in buying tickets and hoped to be selected via lottery \u2014 except there\u2019s a little-understood algorithm involved.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t disclose that. We don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d\n\nAs far as what a fan has to do to come across to the system as a fan, Marcus says, \u201cWe don\u2019t disclose that. We don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d If they did, he argues, scalpers would adapt. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a huge amount of attempted abuse, attempts by bots to create Verified Fan registrations.\u201d (In December of last year, he did tell a PopSugar reporter that her choice to register for a code for every date of Harry Styles\u2019 upcoming arena tour had been a bad idea.)\n\nThe basic process of verifying fans and offering them codes is always the same, he explains, but artists can opt to add an engagement layer on top of that, which \u201ctakes the undifferentiated pool and makes a queue.\u201d The most elaborate (and controversial) example of this so far was Swift\u2019s choice to offer \u201cboosts\u201d that could be procured by buying her album several times (on her website, from Walmart, from Target, from iTunes), buying merchandise, engaging with sponsors on social media, or watching her music videos. The boosts supplement Verified Fan and sort fans into a line, with the most dedicated \u2014 measured both in time and money \u2014 bumped to the front. This has led, obviously, to some strange new behaviors and discussions bubbling up on fan spaces like Tumblr and Reddit. This is also how Ticketmaster\u2019s Verified Fan has become a new ritual of fandom.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent $400 on merch and on 14 preordered Reputation albums and all I really want is for Taylor to see this!!\u201d one fan wrote five weeks before the presale. \u201cIf you guys could please please please tag Tayor and reblog! I can do a giveaway for 13 of the albums too! I really want Taylor to see all that I\u2019ve done!\u201d\n\nFans, collaborative even when under duress (one fan wrote a furious open letter to Swift that began, \u201cDear Taylor, you\u2019ve created the Swiftie hunger games\u201d), shared image macros layering tips and opinions about the new system over pictures of Swift\u2019s face. \u201cI hope others can share their experiences with verified sales through Ticketmaster so we can take everything that people have learned and try to apply it the best we can so we can hopefully all be the lucky ones!\u201d one wrote. Many published email correspondence and transcriptions of phone calls with customer service representatives from Ticketmaster, as well as rumors with notes like \u201cI don\u2019t know how true this is but reblog like crazy.\u201d Once satisfied with their own place in line, some fans saw an opportunity to give away boosts in exchange for follows, likes, and reblogs.\n\nFandom is an activity, one in which demonstrativeness and superstition are the twin pillars of participation. Being a good fan is something that\u2019s done both internally and externally: by achieving tickets to a stadium tour and by helping others to do so, by winning access to an important experience and by having others see that you\u2019ve done so. You\u2019ll use proven tactics and rumored ones.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really known the program to have any type of methodology aside from choosing people based on dumb luck.\u201d\n\nAsked about this economy of information, Marcus says he doesn\u2019t really spend time on Tumblr. \u201cBut if people are going to be fans, great. The world is a better place for that. That\u2019s the behavior we all should be trying to reward as much as possible.\u201d\n\nEvery fan I spoke to for this article shared the same two feelings: that Verified Fan was a great idea (in the end, they all managed to get tickets), and that it was deeply confusing and stressful. \u201cI\u2019ve never really known the program to have any type of methodology aside from choosing people based on dumb luck,\u201d says Ally, a Niall Horan fan who borrowed a code from a friend to get tickets to the former One Direction member\u2019s upcoming tour. But, \u201cI think it\u2019s great that they\u2019ve put forth this initiative, and it\u2019s a great first step.\u201d\n\nRelated Harry Styles fans are trying to beat the Billboard charts with VPNs and mass coordination\n\nAshley Carncross, a 23-year-old Swift fan from Delaware says, \u201cThe information we were given about the Verified Fan process was so confusing and vague and we really had no idea what to expect\u2026 Even though my call with [Ticketmaster customer service] was seemingly informative, I came to find out, after taking part in the process, that most of the information was wrong.\u201d Yet, she says, \u201cI love the Verified Fan program though. I feel like the tickets actually get into the right hands!\u201d Simi, 21, says she also received confusing information from customer service agents, with some saying that fans\u2019 places in the line would decide when their purchase windows would open and others saying it didn\u2019t really matter. \u201cThat kind of conflicting information is bound to cause mass panic and hysteria,\u201d she says. She adds anyway, \u201cOverall, I love the idea of a verified fan system.\u201d\n\nHeather, a 21-year-old Swift fan, says she saw some fans using the presale as an opportunity. They would buy four tickets when they only needed two, then sell the extras at a huge markup to pay off their own admission. \u201cYou notice that the fans become the scalpers.\u201d\n\nStill, she appreciates that Swift\u2019s presale included boosts that were free, which was great for people like her, who couldn\u2019t afford to shell out for merch or extra copies of the album. \u201cOf course,\u201d she adds, \u201cwatching 50-plus videos every day can get kind of monotonous. Especially when it sometimes wasn\u2019t clear if my video play boosts were going through.\u201d\n\nThe Verified Fan system has been effective, according to Ticketmaster, as about 95 percent of tickets purchased through it are not resold. For the recent presale for Bruce Springsteen\u2019s Broadway residency, Marcus says, the number was 97 percent. This isn\u2019t a negligible improvement: usually, about 30 to 50 percent of tickets for a popular artist\u2019s concert end up on the resale market, where they\u2019re hiked up to astronomical prices. Scalpers and their bots are public enemy number one, to hear Marcus tell it, and he talks about battling them as a \u201cconstant arms race,\u201d one that Ticketmaster hopes to end by addressing \u201cthe root causes\u201d of the predatory resale market: \u201cAnonymous people buying tickets on a first-come-first-serve basis, at below market value.\u201d\n\n\u201cOverall, I love the idea of a verified fan system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the anonymity and website-crashing free-for-all that Verified Fan is mostly meant to address, but the issue of \u201cmarket value\u201d is a thorny one, too. Many of the early reactions to the Swift presale were outrage at pricing for the available seats. Ticketmaster says it has no control over the price point for tickets, nor does Live Nation (though it was just two years ago that Ticketmaster gave away $5 million in ticket vouchers to settle a class action lawsuit over its aggressive service fees). Regardless, it\u2019s clear that someone, at some point in the process, realized that offering tickets to the people who want them the most first was an opportunity to lightly exploit people who are willing to pay as dearly as they can possibly afford for an experience they want very badly, or even feel they need.\n\nThe other elephant in the room is Ticketmaster itself, which merged with Live Nation in 2010 to form Live Nation Entertainment, a corporation that now controls the vast majority of both tickets and venues in the United States.\n\nThough Ticketmaster has spent years battling bots, it also spent a fair amount of time battling fan clubs\n\nU2\u2019s long-running management-operated fan club (which has a $40-per-year membership fee) offered special presales to several of its tours, with some seats for 2017\u2019s Joshua Tree Tour going for as little as $70. But for the upcoming Experience + Innocence tour, they became the first act to sell all available tickets through Verified Fan. The existing fan club had to register again through Verified Fan, and upset fans tweeted about the overly complicated process as well as \u201cexorbitant ticket prices.\u201d (Many of the tweets set the price point at around $300.)\n\nThough Ticketmaster has spent years battling bots, it also spent a fair amount of time battling fan clubs. The details of one of these battles became public when fan club ticketing platform Songkick sued Ticketmaster, alleging anti-competitive behavior and antitrust violations, as well as stealing information from company computers. Emails from both companies were made public, revealing a heated conflict around Adele\u2019s 2016 world tour, for which she wanted to reserve batches of tickets to sell through her fan club \u2014 in venues owned by Live Nation and in venues with exclusive Ticketmaster contracts. In another spat, Ticketmaster tried to compel Alabama Shakes to reimburse it for fees the company \u201clost\u201d when the band sold some of its tickets directly to fans through its fan club.\n\nLeading up to the lawsuit, emails obtained by Amplify revealed Live Nation and Ticketmaster executives \u201craising major alarm bells about the loss of market share to upstart fan club ticketing companies,\u201d and worrying about \u201cpossible disruption.\u201d Songkick ceased operations in October 2017, and the case was resolved this January in a $110 million settlement that included Ticketmaster acquiring Songkick\u2019s remaining assets \u2014 all those that had not been sold off to Warner Music Group in the midst of the lawsuit.\n\nCharitably, Verified Fan is an obvious move and a win-win for Ticketmaster and for fans. Slightly less charitably, it\u2019s savvy branding ripped off from the smaller businesses Ticketmaster has happily watched die out. Scalpers are a good choice for a public enemy, but fan club ticketing operations are a good source of secret inspiration. \u201cScalpers completely abuse artists and fans, not to accomplish anything but a profit,\u201d Marcus says. \u201cIf you want to build a successful retail brand, you can\u2019t stand by and watch that happen. You have to change the way you do business.\u201d By mimicking the way your competitors used to do business.\n\nMarcus laughs when I ask about the volatility of fandom, how having such a personal stake in something can make people lash out when they\u2019re disappointed. He\u2019s familiar. \u201cWe hear from incredulous fans all the time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s opaque for them. We have to treat people as individual fans and do a better job getting to know them.\u201d But many fans haven\u2019t gotten angry at Ticketmaster, he argues. \u201cWe also delighted a lot of people. On Twitter, they were delighted and surprised to be able to pick out the tickets they wanted.\u201d Setting up our interview, his publicist accidentally CC-ed me on an email that said, \u201cI think sending her a variety of positive fan tweets to start would be good.\u201d For the record, it\u2019s true that there are many positive tweets about Verified Fan to be found with a simple search.\n\nVerified Fan is not only a successful integration of fan club ticketing practices, it\u2019s a brilliant branding move for Ticketmaster. \u201cWe\u2019re in the fans business,\u201d Marcus says. \u201cThis is what we do all day. If there are experts, we are those. We don\u2019t enter that space lightly. This is a big deal for us.\u201d\n\nTicketmaster is setting itself up as a new fan object, tied inextricably to the artists that these people love\n\nBy speaking to fans in their own language (an email I received while waiting to buy Harry Styles tickets read, \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to say this, tomorrow is going to be tough\u201d) and coming up with dozens of reasons for them to interact with the platform for weeks at a time, Ticketmaster is setting itself up as a new fan object, tied inextricably to the artists that these people love, and demanding a similar intensity of attention. In Superfandom, Zoe Fraade-Blanar and Aaron Glazer\u2019s examination of the commercialization of fandom over the last several decades, they argue that this is not really even \u201cbranding,\u201d but rather the providing of \u201ccontext.\u201d Context is more volatile because fans participate in its creation, but it\u2019s also more durable and ultimately more profitable. \u201cIn a sense,\u201d they write, \u201cthe purpose of fandom is to project a personal meaning into what would otherwise be a soulless commercial commodity.\u201d\n\nAt the end of our call, Marcus gets frank. \u201cLive entertainment, music, is emotional, and it\u2019s supposed to be,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s art. It\u2019s supposed to be challenging.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a statement with two possible meanings: either buying a ticket is in itself art (and I doubt this is what he means), or the way that some art challenges people is not by temporarily muddying their minds and hearts, but, rather, by putting their purchasing skills to the test.", "description": "Verified Fan is not only a successful integration of fan club ticketing practices; it\u2019s a brilliant branding move for Ticketmaster. \"We\u2019re in the fans business,\" VP David Marcus says. \"This is what we do all day.
