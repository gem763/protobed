The IRP, which was released last week, looks to add a further 1 000MW in 2023 and 2 000MW by 2027 through gas.\n\nAccording to the IRP, government has taken a policy position to \u201csupport the development of gas infrastructure [and] convert all diesel-fired power plants to gas\u201d.\n\nThe 47 appeals have been collated into one 331-page document with which the interested and affected parties are challenging the authorisation by the department of energy and mineral resources to allow multinational energy corporation Eni and Sasol to drill up to six wells for exploration in two areas about 62km offshore from Richards Bay and Durban.\n\n\n\nAmong the appellants are a dive centre, academics, environmental nongovernmental organisations, a documentary production company, an architectural firm, marine biologists and an eThekwini ward committee. The appeals were lodged in terms of the National Environmental Management Act.\n\nThe areas of interest for the exploration drilling fall in what is known as Block ER236, with the northern area covering 1 717.50km2 and the southern area covering 2 905km2. Eni and Sasol hold the exploration rights.\n\nAccording to the environmental impact assessment (EIA), Eni may drill four wells in the northern area and two wells in the southern area, but it may not drill all of them and further exploration will depend on the success or failure of the first drill. The drilling depth is 3 800m to 4 100m in the northern area and 5 100m in the south. Water depths in the northern area range from 1 500m to 2 100m. In the south, the range is between 2 600m and 3 000m. The drilling of one well is expected to take up to 71 days to complete.\n\nThe areas in question are of interest because of recent substantial gas discoveries in northern Mozambique.\n\nThe department of environmental affairs has up to 60 days to reach a decision that, according to environmentalists, could profoundly affect the lives of citizens, sea life and the ocean if the appeals against the drilling fail.\n\nEnvironmental attorneys Adrian Pole and Kirsten Youens filed their appeal on behalf of Wildoceans (one of the programmes run by Wildtrust), which said it was \u201cdisturbed by the quality\u201d of Eni\u2019s EIA.\n\nWildoceans said it had the assessment reviewed by three experts, who concluded that deep-sea offshore oil exploration was \u201ca new frontier for the oil and gas industry\u201d and the frequency of wellhead blowouts was expected to be greater in deep, high-current locations.\n\nShould a wellhead blowout occur, it would be \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for the relevant South African authorities to swiftly respond to such a catastrophe. The experts also said the risk assessment done by the EIA consultants \u201csignificantly underrepresents the likely negative environmental impacts\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, the experts described the multinational\u2019s oil spill modelling in the EIA as \u201chighly unrealistic, with the predicted outcomes presented as a worst-case scenario actually being closer to a best-case scenario\u201d.\n\nEni utilises individuals who are highly skilled and experienced in the oil and gas field, and says in its EIA that there are \u201climited\u201d employment opportunities in the early stages of the project.\n\n\u201cThis outlook is anticipated to significantly change based on the success of the exploratory well. True potential is realised at the subsea field development stage of the lifecycle [analysis],\u201d the company said.\n\nThe South Durban Community Environmental Alliance is also against the projects. The group\u2019s appeal makes a detailed case against the proposed drilling, including the claim that Eni\u2019s EIA contains a \u201clegally flawed assessment of risk and impacts of a catastrophic oil spill\u201d, and that the EIA report was \u201cfatally flawed because it failed to adequately assess socioeconomic impacts\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe economic impact of the proposed exploration on people who depend on the ocean for a living has not been considered,\u201d said the group\u2019s appeal submission.\n\nREAD: Sasol spends billions for gas\n\n\n\nAccording to the activists, Eni\u2019s own report recognised that \u201can unplanned event such as a spill could result in a loss of access to marine-based income-generating activities. The EIA report is found wanting in a number of respects, and the risks associated with this lack of information are massive. Consequently, in the face of this incomplete information, the department of energy and mineral resources should not have granted environmental authorisation.\u201d\n\nThe appeal is almost certainly going to push back Eni\u2019s anticipated plans to start the process next month, with a hope of finalising the appeal process before March.\n\nAccording to government\u2019s Operation Phakisa website, \u201cSouth Africa\u2019s coast and adjoining waters have possible resources of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil \u2013equivalent to 40 years of South African oil consumption\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe also have 11 billion oil equivalent barrels of natural gas, which is equal to 375 years of South African gas consumption. However, there is significant uncertainty about the extent of these resources.\u201d\n\nA target has been set of drilling 30 exploration wells in 10 years, according to Operation Phakisa, which could, over the next 20 years, lead to the production of 370 000 barrels of oil and gas a day.\n\n\u201cThis is about 80% of current oil and gas imports. The result would be 130 000 jobs and a contribution of $2.2 billion (R32 billion) to the country\u2019s GDP.\u201d\n\nAccording to the department of environmental affairs, the responsibility of enforcing matters concerning pollution lies with the department of energy and mineral resources. In the event of an oil spill, environmental affairs spokesperson Albie Modise said there was an intergovernmental initiative under Operation Phakisa that would coordinate the action.\n\n\u201cThere is a basic incident management structure to respond to emergency incidents in a coordinated manner. Among other things, they must ensure effective use and deployment of available resources for all types of emergency incidents,\u201d said Modise.\n\nHe said that \u201ceach appeal is decided on its own facts and merits\u201d.\n\nEni told City Press that \u201cwherever\u201d it operated, it undertook exploration activities according to \u201cinternational best practice standards and in accordance with local laws, within the parameters set out by competent authorities and agencies, and engages in dialogue with stakeholders following locally determined norms, as well as recognised best practices\u201d\n\n.", "description": "Eni and Sasol are stopped in their tracks by appeals against offshore gas and oil exploration \u2013 for now.", "authors": ["Desiree Erasmus"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5053/f3d3bfb993204d89bb52a7a7e22a1da2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
