Gates, who is co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and founder of the investment firm Pivotal Ventures, penned an op-ed in Time magazine outlining her reasons for making the investment.\n\n\u201cI want to see more women in the position to make decisions, control resources, and shape policies and perspectives,\u201d Gates writes. \u201cI believe that women\u2019s potential is worth investing in\u2014and the people and organizations working to improve women\u2019s lives are, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see more women in the position to make decisions.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gates, Pivotal Ventures will extend resources to \u201cnew and established partners\u201d that seek to expand the power and influence of women in the marketplace. It doesn\u2019t have a full plan just yet, but Gates says the organization will have three main priorities: removing barriers to women\u2019s professional advancement; fast-tracking women in sectors like tech, media, and government; and \u201cmobilizing shareholders\u201d into pressuring companies to make reforms in support of gender equality.\n\n\u201cEquality can\u2019t wait, and no one in a position to act should either,\u201d Gates says. \u201cWe are right to be outraged. But we\u2019re also right to be optimistic. Americans are no longer willing to accept the glacial pace of change \u2014 and I feel lucky to be alive at a time when we no longer have to.\u201d", "description": "Melinda Gates has announced a $1 billion commitment over the next decade to promote gender equality in the United States.
