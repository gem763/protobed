No, you are not reading the same news story again, though it certainly feels that way. And who could blame you for thinking that you have deja vu while reading about this case? On Thursday, ABC 7's Kevin Lewis reported that police in Montgomery County, Maryland have arrested an illegal immigrant on molestation charges. This has now occurred again, and again, and again, and again, and again. That's right, this is now the sixth individual illegally in the country accused of sexual offenses in one Maryland county in the past month alone. And here's the kicker -- Montgomery Count Executive Marc Elrich insists he doesn't have a problem and that his jurisdiction isn't a sanctuary county.\n\nLewis reports that Nestor Lopez-Guzman was arrested by Montgomery County police on August 18th after police were notified that the 21-year-old Salvadoran national sexually abused 12-year-old girl and her brother over a six month period. The unidentified victim told police that on more than one occasion, Lopez-Guzman would touch her legs and try to move his hand up towards her vagina.\n\nNEW: Nestor Lopez-Guzman molested a 12yo girl + her younger brother, cops say.\n\n\n\nPer ICE, the 21yo is a Salvadoran national living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\n\nThis is at least the sixth undocumented immigrant arrested in Montgomery County, Md. on rape/sex abuse charges since July 25. pic.twitter.com/KSmT05qajU \u2014 Kevin Lewis (@ABC7Kevin) August 29, 2019\n\nShe stated that she doesn't believe he ever actually did touch her genitals, because she would kick him and move away before he ever could. But, she stated that these approaches sexual in nature. The accused pervert would say to the minor \"how delicious\" while making the advances. On one occasion, while Lopez-Guzman held the victim's nine-month-old sister, the suspect is alleged to have forcibly put his hand down the minor's shirt and touching her breasts.\n\nMORE: According to detectives, Lopez-Guzman confessed to touching the elementary school-age boy's genitals, claiming it was a \"cultural joke\" that's \"common in El Salvador.\"\n\n\n\nLopez-Guzman said it's a way for men to poke fun at one another.\n\n\n\nThe 21yo is out on bond awaiting trial. pic.twitter.com/Xvg4l0dkCK \u2014 Kevin Lewis (@ABC7Kevin) August 29, 2019\n\nLewis also reports that \"Lopez-Guzman confessed to touching the elementary school-age boy's genitals, claiming it was a 'cultural joke' that's 'common in El Salvador.'\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed that Lopez-Guzman is in the country illegally. ICE lodged a detainer on him two days after he was arrested, took him in custody, and released him after he posted an immigration bond.\n\nIn mid-August, I reported on the two illegal immigrants accused of repeatedly raping an 11-year-old girl. In July, I reported on the illegal immigrant who targeted more than 25 women addicted to drugs. The foreign national would then offer narcotics in exchange for sex for himself and his associates. Last week, an illegal immigrant accused of first-degree rape and attempted second-degree murder was arrested. Just two days ago, I reported that an illegal alien was arrested for allegedly crawling into a 16-year-old girl's bed and raping her at knifepoint. All of these crimes occurred in Montgomery County.\n\nBut, what does Montgomery County Exeutive Elrich have to say on the issue? Well, he told a frustrated Vince Coglianese of WMAL radio in DC on Wednesday, \"Look, I understand that tension. But, I mean, are you suggesting we should -- I mean, do you support just deporting all illegal immigrants?\"\n\n12/ Elrich: \"Look, I understand that tension. But, I mean, are you suggesting we should -- I mean, do you support just deporting all illegal immigrants?\"\n\n\n\nMe: \"I support creating new laws if you don't like the ones you have to enforce.\"\n\n\n\nFULL AUDIO: https://t.co/zlFFw8JCX9 \u2014 Vince Coglianese (@VinceCoglianese) August 28, 2019\n\nPathetic.\n\nBut is Montgomery County a sanctuary city? Well, technically not, but it may as well be considered one:", "description": "That's a half dozen illegal immigrants accused of sexual assault in less than a month.
