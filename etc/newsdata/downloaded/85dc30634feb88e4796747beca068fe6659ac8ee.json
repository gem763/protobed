The updated item features a special white cheddar cheese-flavored sesame seed bun. The spectral-white bun comes with the original flame-grilled beef burger and is topped with tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, white onions and pickles.\n\nTo publicize the limited-edition menu item, Burger King enlisted psychic medium Riz Mirza to host a \u201cspirit taste test.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe so-called \u201ctrance channel\u201d gave spirits the opportunity to try the upgraded burger and communicate their thoughts in a \u201cvery unusual experiment.\u201d\n\nHow did the spirits rate the spookiest addition to the Burger King menu? You\u2019ll have to watch for yourself to find out \u2014 but it\u2019s safe to say that the Ghost Whopper was \u201capproved by 11 out of 10 people.\u201d\n\nThe seasonal offering will sell for a recommended price of $4.59 at select restaurants. Stop by a Burger King location in Detroit, Memphis, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, Savannah, Summerville or New Orleans to sample the spooky menu item. But act fast \u2014 the Ghost Whopper will only be available from Oct. 24 until Halloween, or while supplies last.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:", "description": "Find out where you can get the limited-edition burger before it vanishes.", "authors": ["Maggie Andrew"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9_xA8OUu95gTnL8eUh62Ng--~B/aD0zNjA7dz03MjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/bc6dbf50-f454-11e9-bfda-0dde60f97467", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
