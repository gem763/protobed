And that has another group\u2014perhaps a surprising one\u2014salivating over the profit potential: the meat industry.\n\nBig names in meaty-meat products\u2014including Tyson, Perdue, Hormel, Smithfield, and Nestle\u0301\u2014are all trying to get a cut of the fake and alternative-meat products world, according to The New York Times. Following the juicy success of Impossible Foods (with its Impossible Burgers) and Beyond Meat, meat producers have carved out their own plant-based versions of burgers, chicken nuggets, sausages, and more.\n\nIn April, Nestle\u0301 served up its \u201cAwesome\u201d burger, made with soy and wheat protein, plus extracts from beetroot, carrot, and bell pepper. Poultry purveyors Tyson and Perdue followed in June with their own plant-based and \u201cblended\u201d products. Tyson introduced plant-based nuggets and burgers, as well as sausage and meatballs made with both chicken and plant-based ingredients.\n\nPerdue went a little further, introducing nuggets, patties, and tenders made with chicken, cauliflower, chickpeas, and plant protein. They called the new line CHICKEN PLUS\u2122, that is, chicken with bonus \u201cvegetable nutrients.\u201d Some of the veggie-packed chicken nuggets come in dinosaur shapes.\n\nIn August, big pork producer Smithfield Foods announced an entire \u201cportfolio\u201d of plant-based meat and dairy alternatives. Lastly, Hormel\u2014maker of Spam and Applegate meats\u2014announced its own plant-based and blended products.\n\nPlant-based beef\n\nOverall, it\u2019s unclear if the trend among meat makers is good or bad for the feisty fake-meat industry.\n\nMany faux-meat fans\u2014including CEOs of Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat\u2014tout environmental benefits of ditching meat-eating, as well as animal-welfare issues and potential health benefits. But the Big Meat companies do not appear to be moved by any such noble motivations. A spokesperson for Tyson told the Times concisely: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s really about the business opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnd while some argue that meat-makers trying to get a stake in the market is a sign of success, others worry it could signal trouble ahead. There\u2019s concern that the carnivorous industry could end up gobbling start-ups, co-opting marketing messages, and using plant-based products to divert attention from their less savory practices, the Times notes.\n\nSuch issues are a \u201clegitimate concern,\u201d Glenn Hurowitz, who runs the environmental advocacy organization Mighty Earth, told the Times. He noted that Big Oil companies spent years buying up clean-energy start-ups and essentially shut them down.\n\nFor now, Beyond and Impossible are doing just fine, expanding and coming up with new products. They\u2019ve also fired up meat-lovers against the new products\u2014a clear sign of their success. In June, Arby\u2019s unveiled a meat-based carrot, or marrot, aimed at mocking plant-based meat. It\u2019s unclear if the marrot will ever show up in any restaurants.", "description": "Meat makers jump on the meatless wagon and tout \"vegetable nutrition.\"", "authors": ["Beth Mole"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/impossible-burgers-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
