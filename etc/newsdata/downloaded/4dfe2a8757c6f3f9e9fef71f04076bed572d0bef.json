Thursday night's event at Sydney's Town Hall will be no exception.\n\nGiven Scott Morrison is giving the main speech, a hefty contingent of Liberal politicians put themselves down to hear him speak.\n\nExpected to attend are Senators Mathias Cormann and Jane Hume, as well as lower-house representatives Dave Sharma and Paul Fletcher. Soon-to-be US ambassador Arthur Sinodinos was expected, as was NSW treasurer Dominic Perrottet.\n\nASIS head spook Paul Symon will be there, as will the Attorney-General's department secretary Chris Moraitis and PM &C secretary Phil Gaetjens. ABC chairwoman Ita Buttrose is representing the organisation (her managing director being in Melbourne for the Asia Society gala).\n\nWith any luck, someone thought to add an appropriate distance between RBA Governor Phil Lowe and the bankers, including Westpac's Brian Hartzer and Lindsay Maxsted and NAB's Phil Chronican. None of their institutions passed on this week's interest rate cut in full, making Lowe's job a little harder.\n\nOf course, the Lowy Institute itself can always pull a decent crowd just based on those who hold some formal role in it. Sir Frank Lowy and son Steven are guaranteed attendees, as are Lowy board members David Gonski, Glenn Stevens, Jim Spigelman and Angus Houston.", "description": "The Lowy Institute's flagship annual lecture tends to draw a hefty crowd.
