Statehood Is Rooted in Racism", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cWe cannot ignore the elephant in the room, the District government currently faces serious allegations of misconduct,\u201d said Ohio Representative Jim Jordan.\n\nJordan, the ranking Republican on the committee, spent the majority of his opening remarks focused on the absence of D.C. Council Member Jack Evans, who is currently embroiled in a federal grand jury investigation for attempting to leverage his political position for employment and for illegally accepting cash and stock shares. (Eleven of the 13 council members were present to discuss the issue of statehood.)\n\nTo acquiesce to the District\u2019s request would violate what has become a core tenant of the GOP\u2019s chosen approach to urban America, be it a national or local race. During the 2016 presidential election, in an interview with a Boston radio station, Senator Ted Cruz derided \u201cNew York values\u201d as being somehow counter to those of the average American. Two years later, Wisconsin state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos casually commented that, \u201cif you took Madison and Milwaukee out of the state election formula, we would have a clear majority.\u201d Earlier this week, President Donald Trump threatened San Francisco with federal action for allowing the needles of homeless drug-users to drain into the ocean. (The claim was quickly debunked by local experts.) \u201cWe can\u2019t have our cities going to hell,\u201d the president told the press.\n\nThe basis of the bias in every one of these cases is clear, and it applies to the District\u2019s fight for statehood. Forty-six percent of D.C.\u2019s 700,000 residents are black. Republicans assume (most likely correctly given their current political positions) this part of the D.C. population would not vote for their candidates, so they have no desire to grant them their constitutional rights. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell admitted as much in June. \u201c[Democrats] plan to make the District of Columbia a state\u2014that would give them two new Democratic senators,\u201d he told FOX News.\n\nBut arguments that race is the reason conservatives so adamantly oppose D.C.\u2019s push for statehood are met with outrage. Democratic Representative George Connolly demonstrated as much, calling the GOP\u2019s position race based during Thursday\u2019s hearing. A witness opposed to statehood, Roger Pilon of the Cato Institute, called upon Connolly to officially remove his remarks from the record; Connolly defiantly replied, \u201cNever!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe facts are very clearly on the side of statehood. Not only do the denizens of D.C. favor it by a wide margin, the numbers simply demand the creation of a 51st state. If admitted, the new state would be more populous than Vermont and Wyoming and close on the heels of six others. The IRS already collects more tax revenue from the district than 22 current states, and its budget outranks at least 14 state governments.\n\nRepresentative Jordan\u2019s contention that corruption is somehow a barrier to statehood quickly falls apart. If applied to the nation\u2019s current roster of states, the stringent measure would almost certainly result in a culling of membership: New York is out, thanks to the dealings of Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s former associates; Illinois elects a corrupt governor at least once a decade; North Carolina\u2014with the Greg Lindberg scandal and the recent bout of election fraud\u2014is easily gone.\n\n\u201cCertainly officials in Ohio have been the subject of multiple political scandals for many years,\u201d D.C.\u2019s Norton said in reply to buckeye Jordan. \u201cBut no one is suggesting that Ohio ought to lose its status.\u201d\n\nThe United States has not admitted a new state to the union in 60 years, and given the current balance of the Senate and the current president, there is little chance that D.C. achieves statehood this year. But to allow the GOP to claim the reason for this denial is one based on a wariness over a shaky government is to acquiesce to their imbalanced rules of play. The reasons should be stated clearly and for the record: Republicans fear cities and those who inhabit them because they stand in the way of GOP power.", "description": "The GOP's anti-urban agenda takes many forms, but it always tracks back to wealthy whites' fear of losing power.", "authors": ["Nick Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e5c62b5bc918ceaa47c13244ce9c5b149faf0a21.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
