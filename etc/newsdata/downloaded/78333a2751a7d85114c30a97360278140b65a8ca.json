The piety, the tetchiness, the May-esque refusal to answer a simple question, the Trump-esque baseless attacks at the media, absolutely all of it.\n\nIt is hard to know where to start, really. Last year, at his eve of conference appearance on the Andrew Marr Show, Corbyn discovered it is perhaps unwise to only do this thing once a year. In 20 toe-curling minutes, he found himself having to walk through, piece by agonising piece, a full twelve month\u2019s worth of antisemitism scandals.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nQuite remarkably this time, however, he found that he and his party had produced more than enough material to fill Marr\u2019s allotted 25-minutes in just the last 24 hours.\n\nWhy had his allies in the party just tried to kick out the deputy leader? Marr wanted to know. Corbyn sighed. He rolled his eyes heavenward. All this was so very far beneath him. He doesn\u2019t get this tetchy that often, maybe only two or three times a year, but unfortunately for him, he only does it when he is absolutely bang to rights. The classic tell.\n\nThe move to abolish the position of deputy leader, and thus to defenestrate Tom Watson was brought by Jon Lansman, the guy who ran Corbyn\u2019s leadership campaign, twice, and it was voted for by two of Corbyn\u2019s most loyal allies, Diane Abbott and Rebecca Long-Bailey, before ultimately failing. But it had nothing to do with Corbyn, oh no, not me guv.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a move against Tom Watson specifically, it was concerns about the role of deputy leader,\u201d Corbyn told Marr. There is absolutely no one alive who believes this.\n\nLansman is not a difficult man to spot at Labour Party conference. He wears floral shirts that he buys in job lots (completely true). He himself, when asked, is not bothering to pretend this is true.\n\nUltimately, the backlash against the move was so severe, and so threatened to utterly undermine the entire conference, that Corbyn intervened at the last minute yesterday to kick it into the long grass.\n\n\u201cI proposed a statement to the National Executive Committee,\u201d he told Marr, \u201cthat we should have a consultation about having two deputy leaders in the future, which would reflect gender and hopefully ethnic balance within our society.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

When you attempt some straightforwardly shabby politics and it backfires, well, there is always the cause of women and ethnic minorities to dig you out of a hole.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s saintliness should never be queried. He has spent all his life fighting against inequality and injustice (it is frankly a miracle that there nevertheless still seems to be so much of it about).\n\nWhen his acolytes try to sling the deputy leader out of the shadow cabinet but cock it up, it is, naturally, merely about Corbyn doing his little bit for social justice, yet again.\n\nIn any event, Corbyn was growing weary of all these Watson questions. He sniffed again. He shook his head. He jutted his head forward like an angry ostrich.\n\n\u201cThis conference is actually about policy,\u201d he said, in as patronising a tone as any man can muster when they know they\u2019re so hopelessly in the wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s about health, it\u2019s about housing, it\u2019s about education, it\u2019s about environment. That\u2019s why all these people are here.\u201d\n\nWho did Andrew Marr think he was exactly, asking the Labour leader about a blatant attempt to kick out his own deputy?\n\nStill, they did start talking about policy after that, kind of, and that\u2019s when things instantly got much worse.\n\nAnd that\u2019s because the chap who\u2019s actually responsible for Labour party policy has resigned, and his resignation letter is on the fron page of The Sunday Times, which Marr then read out.\n\nAndrew Fisher, who has spent months coming up with almost all of the policies that will be launched with as much fanfare as possible at this conference, is quitting over a \u201clack of professionalism, competence and human decency\u201d within Corbyn\u2019s office, and because he has had enough of their \u201cblizzard of lies and excuses\u201d.\n\nThis made Corbyn even tetchier than before. He cocked his head. He exhaled hard through his nose. He\u2019d just had a perfectly \u201cconvivial cup of coffee\u201d that morning with Fisher and the rest of his team, a claim we must take at face value, while considering how often convivial cups of coffee are drunk between people who have called each other liars on the front of The Sunday Times.\n\nSince the memo became public, most of Corbyn\u2019s online army have been busily calling it all a lie. That the mainstream media had just made it up.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Corbyn himself confirmed it was real. But not only was it real, this memo in which his own most loyal staff had been called liars and humanly indecent, it was also, apparently, no big deal.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would have thought similar memos fly around the BBC pretty well every day Andrew,\" Corbyn told him. \"Even in your own team.\"\n\nMarr looked more confused than agitated. It seemed beyond the scope of his comprehension that Corbyn could possibly be being serious. That he could even have said it. It is, after all, as absolutely 100 per cent pure Donald Trump as it gets.\n\nYes, that\u2019s right Andrew, my policy chief has quit over the lack of human decency in my office, but come on, we all know the mainstream media is the real enemy here. I bet backstage, at the Andrew Marr Show, they\u2019re all calling each other incompetent liars lacking in human decency. They\u2019re probably even saying it about you Andrew, aren\u2019t they, behind your back. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s lacking in human decency here, and everyone knows it.\n\nAll of which means there is barely time to get on to Labour\u2019s Brexit policy. Corbyn is still maintaining, with as straight a face as possible, that his plan is to have a general election, win it, then negotiate a new, better deal with the EU, then have a referendum on it in which he, the actual prime minister by this point, will remain neutral.\n\nFor around three minutes, he pointedly refused to answer whether he would back Leave or Remain in his own referendum, a position he genuinely imagines he can maintain through an entire election campaign.\n\nIt would, he said, depend on the deal he himself negotiated. He also said it would be possible to get a deal that would leave Britain \u201cbetter off out of the EU.\u201d (Don\u2019t tell the EU that, because they definitely won\u2019t be offering it).\n\nHere is the really laughable thing. It\u2019s not merely that he will fight a general election without a Brexit position. It\u2019s not merely that he, as the leader of the Labour Party, is openly stating he\u2019s just happy to go with whatever the party decides, like a hopeless best man on a badly-organised stag do.\n\nIt\u2019s that he won\u2019t even fight an election on his own ability to get a good deal. The public will be asked to vote for him, on a promise that he\u2019ll go to Brussels and get a deal that may or may not be better than leaving, but don\u2019t ask me because I haven\u2019t negotiated it yet.\n\nThat is quite the slogan. Vote for me, and we\u2019ll see if I\u2019m any good.\n\nUnfortunately, his policy chief\u2019s own view on that is all over the front pages of the newspapers. Who knows? It is dimly possible that the public might come to the same view.", "description": "Even in these wild political times, the annual Jeremy Corbyn set-piece interview retains its status as one of the Grand Slam events, and this year\u2019s was a classic for the ages.
