Johnson VA Hospital in Clarksburg, according to Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who serves on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, and the person is no longer in contact with any veterans at the hospital. There have been no arrests.\n\nCharleston attorney Tony O\u2019Dell, who is representing the family of one of the homicide victims, said in an interview Wednesday that five other families have contacted him with suspicions concerning the death loved ones at the hospital. Each of the patients took an unexpected, fatal turn for the worse and died.\n\n\u201cThe picture is becoming more clear to us,\u201d O\u2019Dell told West Virginia\u2019s MetroNews \u201cThe deaths all came from one floor. Every victim so far has been on 3A.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Dell said last month that the deaths represent \u201ca complete and total betrayal of the trust of our veterans and their loved ones. There are system failures at work here that allowed so many veterans to die in the same manner.\u201d\n\nTony O'dell, layer representing Felix McDermott, talks with @HoppyKercheval about ongoing investigation of murders at the VA medical center.

Manchin also expressed frustration with the lack of communication and transparency from either office regarding the investigations.\n\nAn irritated Machin told reporters Tuesday that he was upset by a lack of answers. \u201cThey have a person of interest,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cI said, \u2018It shouldn\u2019t take that long to find the evidence. It\u2019s been over a year now.\u2019\u201d\n\nHospital officials alerted the VA Office of Inspector General about the suspicious deaths in June 2018, according to a spokesman.", "description": "A \"person of interest\" reportedly has been identified in deaths at a VA hospital in West Virginia.
