So let\u2019s keep doing that.\n\nGeelong\u2019s trade of Tim Kelly to West Coast for a haul of picks sees him valued at even more than the first pick in the draft. It\u2019s a huge price for a young superstar.\n\nBut Tim Kelly, at 25 years old, isn\u2019t the only great young player in the AFL. There are arguably players both greater and younger. Theoretically, they\u2019d be worth even more in a trade.\n\nStream over 50 sports live & anytime on your TV or favourite device with KAYO SPORTS.

Or look at it this way; who would you pick first, out of the entire league, if you were starting a new club from scratch?\n\nLet\u2019s take context out of it. Ignore whether you\u2019re a club in the premiership window, ignore where your club is located and if the player would want to leave, ignore contracts. Assume you\u2019re getting the player\u2019s entire career.\n\nAnd we\u2019re limiting this to players because while a few people might say Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson, we find it tough to believe one coach is more valuable than a superstar player, given how much assistants and backroom staff matter these days.\n\nWe\u2019ve canvassed a wide range of opinions to try and answer this impossible question.\n\nLISTEN TO THE LATEST EPISODE OF TRADING DAY BELOW, OR TAP HERE TO SUBSCRIBE IN ITUNES OR SPOTIFY\n\nON YOUR PHONE? TAP HERE TO LISTEN\n\nTHE STATS\n\nIn this thought experiment, the age of the player is extremely important.\n\nBecause we\u2019re saying you\u2019re getting their entire career, even adding one or two more years of a player in their prime to a team could be the difference between winning a flag or not.\n\nCompare Dustin Martin to Marcus Bontempelli. The Tigers star is probably a better player right now - we say probably because you can make a case for the Bulldog.\n\nBut Dusty is also five years older than the Bont. Assume they both retire at the same age - that\u2019s five fewer years of a star player if you take Dusty. The gap between them, if it exists, isn\u2019t worth that.\n\nTaking this to its logical conclusion, the correct answer to the question of \u2018who is the most valuable asset in the AFL\u2019 is who best mixes talent and youth. What we want to do then is figure out which player is going to have the most value over the length of their remaining career.\n\nTreloar was on trade table 0:31\n\nMany global sports have popular systems for this, but one of the few for the AFL was created by the creators of HPNfooty.com, Cody Atkinson and Sean Lawson.\n\nTheir system is known as PAPLEY - following in the footsteps of baseball\u2019s PECOTA as a backronym, as in an acronym that is also a player\u2019s name.\n\nIt uses their \u2018Player Approximate Value\u2019 system (yes, PAV) to predict the future careers of players based on their age and ability for their careers to date.\n\nAccording to the PAPLEY system, the best two candidates are Bontempelli (turns 24 years old next month) and GWS\u2019 Tim Taranto.\n\nThe latter may surprise some people, but consider that Taranto is just 21 years old (22 in January) and won the best and fairest award in a Grand Final side this year.\n\nTim Taranto won the Giants\u2019 best and fairest award this season at just 21 years old.

If he continues to improve on his current arc as a player, or even starts to level out, he may be (or continue being) one of the best players in the league for that time,\u201d Atkinson told Foxfooty.com.au.\n\n\u201cBontempelli will likely provide the same, just for a few years less. Bontempelli was better at age 21 (22.6 PAV v 19.3) and better this year, but with trade and list building valuations, age matters a lot, because the quantity of future career available matters.\u201d\n\nSystems like PAPLEY use the career paths of thousands of past players to compare current players and project their futures.\n\nIn Taranto\u2019s case, his best comparisons for the rest of his career include superstars like Robert Harvey, Michael Voss, Mark Ricciuto and Ben Cousins.\n\nLoose Pie steals show at B&F 1:55\n\n\u201cPractically every similar three-year career opening continued on to produce more future value as the average pick one,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nThe argument for Bontempelli as compared to Taranto is that we\u2019ve seen the Bulldogs superstar play at this level for several years in a row.\n\nHe is a known quantity, while still having a decade of footy ahead of him. He also has the added versatility of being able to play forward.\n\n\u201cBontempelli is the safer bet with more exposed form - and is also a very valid answer. If two years of good to great football isn\u2019t enough to judge on, Bontempelli\u2019s five years should be more than enough. Very few 21 year olds can carry teams to Grand Finals,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\n\u201cEither one would be a valid choice. But Bont may simply be further along the same trajectory as Taranto is headed. Taranto is more of a risk, but his potential far exceeds anyone else in the league.\u201d\n\nMarcus Bontempelli has polled 19 votes or more in the Brownlow Medal in his three full seasons.

He\u2019ll be 25 next season and is viewed by many as one of the game\u2019s best players.\n\nBut Cripps\u2019 best skill - clearance dominance - is being less and less important. Dominant teams now score more from turnovers than stoppages.\n\nIf you built a team around Cripps, you\u2019d be focusing on scoring from stoppages. That means you\u2019d be off-trend in the current AFL - and as we\u2019ve seen with Carlton, he can\u2019t carry a team to success by himself.\n\nOther options thrown up by PAPLEY include Brodie Grundy and Jeremy Cameron - they\u2019re arguably the best players in their two positions right now, \u201cbut both are 25 and 26 and would waste their best remaining years on a club that would struggle in their first few seasons\u201d.\n\nIf you like backmen, Harris Andrews has to be in the mix, while don\u2019t count out Hawthorn\u2019s James Worpel - \u201che\u2019d be in with a shout if he had one more good year under his belt, but it\u2019s probably too early to make that call on him yet,\u201d Atkinson said.\n\nFor more on the PAPLEY system and other footy stats writing, head to HPNfooty.com.\n\nCats happy with Kelly trade 0:52\n\nTHE EXPERTS\n\nThere\u2019s an award for the AFL\u2019s most valuable player - it\u2019s named as such and given out by the Players\u2019 Association. It doesn\u2019t quite suit this hypothetical, but it\u2019s as close an approximation as we have.\n\nAs it turns out, the players and two Fox Footy experts were in alignment - the most valuable asset in the game is Patrick Cripps.\n\nSt Kilda champion Leigh Montagna was sure that a midfielder had to be the pick, and he was torn between Marcus Bontempelli and Cripps.\n\n\u201cThose midfielders that can go forward are the most valuable players in the comp. That\u2019s why they win all the awards,\u201d he told Foxfooty.com.au.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Bontempelli or Cripps ... Cripps. It\u2019s a close call.\u201d\n\nPatrick Cripps won the AFLPA MVP award this season.

We\u2019re all better when we\u2019re in a good team, we\u2019re all All-Australians and all that,\u201d Montagna said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re the one that\u2019s carrying (the team), like what he (Cripps) has done at Carlton, that\u2019s harder to do.\n\n\u201cImagine if Paddy Cripps was in Geelong\u2019s team. He would\u2019ve won a couple of Brownlows.\u201d\n\nNorth Melbourne dual premiership player David King compared Cripps to one of his former teammates and one of the modern greats.\n\n\u201cI think Cripps, he\u2019s sort of the presence that reminds me of (Wayne) Carey a bit. He\u2019s that leader, he\u2019s happy to have a beer with you, he trains hard, works hard, plays hard.\n\n\u201cI still think there\u2019s so much scope for him ... he hasn\u2019t hardly been forward yet. Hasn\u2019t stepped foot inside the forward 50 yet.\u201d\n\nKing suggested if Cripps was given \u201cthe Dustin Martin role\u201d, he could reach heights we haven\u2019t seen yet.\n\nDustin Martin might be the best player in the AFL right now, but at 28, he\u2019s not the most valuable asset. (AAP Image/Michael Dodge) Source: AAP\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nIf this thought experiment actually happened, there\u2019s one factor you\u2019d have to take into account - the human capacity for risk.\n\nIf you truly had Pick 1 in an entirety-of-the-AFL draft, you\u2019d have a huge amount of pressure on you. Getting it wrong could ruin your club.\n\nBecause of that, you\u2019d want to pick the best player, but also a safe option. The younger the player, the more potential years you\u2019re getting, but the greater the risk you\u2019re taking on.\n\nBased on this we think the answer is Bontempelli. He has shown an ability to play at an elite level for multiple seasons in a row, for both a premiership side and a young team that needs leadership, and still has probably ten years left in him.\n\nCould you go for Taranto, with the idea that he\u2019ll have an extra two or three years on the back-end of his career, or Aaron Naughton, because of positional scarcity and him being even younger? Absolutely.\n\nCould you even go for Dustin Martin or Nat Fyfe and know you have arguably the best player in the game right now? If you\u2019re trying to win a flag immediately, they might be the better call.\n\nBut they\u2019re not the perfect combination of youth, talent and experience that the Bont is.", "description": "It\u2019s the time of the AFL year when we start looking at human beings as assets.
