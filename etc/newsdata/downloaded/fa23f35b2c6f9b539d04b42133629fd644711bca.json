But equally important \u2013 and hardly ever mentioned \u2013 is to leave the existing ones standing and to leave the natural habitats intact. https://t.co/0EGDMZY7vf \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) October 4, 2019\n\nWe cannot allow her to get away with this.\n\nI don\u2019t mean the stuff about saving trees: obviously saving trees is a good thing.\n\nRather, I mean this ludicrous idea that she and her fellow green loons have that only they know how to care for the planet, and that the rest of us \u2014 conservatives, especially, who believe in economic growth and free markets \u2014 know only how to destroy it.\n\nIt\u2019s time, I think, that we conservatives reminded the world that we are the original and best conservationists \u2014 and that there\u2019s absolutely nothing urban, yogurt-weaving, tofu-munching eco-loons can teach us about caring for nature.\n\nTrees are a very good example of this. Almost everything the greenie propagandists tell us about trees is a lie.\n\nOne obvious recent example of this is the Amazon fire scare. It dominated the headlines all summer, with politicians such as France\u2019s president Emmanuel Macron and celebrities from Madonna and Jennifer Lopez to Leo DiCaprio piling in to warn us of this man-made catastrophe.\n\nBut as I wrote in a piece titled \u2018Amazon Fires \u2013 A Big, Fat Nothingburger of a #FakeNews Scare Story this wasn\u2019t actually true.\n\nThe pictures were old, the claims exaggerated or misleading.\n\nAs Matt Ridley noted in the Spectator:\n\nMore significantly, the rate of deforestation in the Amazon basin is down by 70 per cent since 2004.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nAround the world, wild fires are generally declining, according to Nasa. Deforestation, too, is happening less and less. The United Nations\u2019 \u2018state of the world\u2019s forests\u2019report concluded last year that \u2018the net loss of forest area continues to slow, from 0.18 per cent [a year] in the 1990s to 0.08 per cent over the last five-year period\u2019. A study in Nature last year by scientists from the University of Maryland concluded that even this is too pessimistic: \u2018We show that \u2014 contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally \u2014 tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1 per cent relative to the 1982 level).\u2019 This net increase is driven by rapid reforestation in cool, rich countries outweighing slower net deforestation in warm, poor countries. But more and more nations are now reaching the sort of income levels at which they stop deforesting and start reforesting. Bangladesh, for example, has been increasing its forest cover for several years. Costa Rica has doubled its tree cover in 40 years. Brazil is poised to join the reforesters soon.\n\nSo, in the real world \u2014 as opposed to the fantasy one greenies inhabit \u2014 the very worst case scenario is that deforestation has dramatically slowed and the best one is that forest cover has actually increased.\n\nOne reason for this is global greening caused by increasing CO2 levels. Another is that prosperity is enabling poorer countries to find the spare money they need to engage in environmental projects.\n\nBoth the above examples are, of course, anathema to greenies who see CO2 \u2014 or \u201ccarbon\u201d as they prefer to call it, because it sounds all black and scary \u2014 as an unmitigated evil and \u201cprosperity\u201d as the enemy because it involves economic growth.\n\nGreenies really don\u2019t have a track record worth boasting about on trees. Back in 2018, they sought to blame the disastrous wildfires in California and elsewhere on President Trump\u2019s denial of climate change.\n\nBut the real reason those wildfires burned and spread with such uncontrollable intensity was because of maladministration arising from greenie ideology.\n\nIn my original article, I quoted the Daily Caller, which had interviewed an experienced forester called Bob Zybach. He blamed misguided, eco-friendly policies dating from the Clinton era.\n\nWhile some want to blame global warming for the uptick in catastrophic wildfires, Zybach said a change in forest management policies is the main reason Americans are seeing a return to more intense fires, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and California where millions of acres of protected forests stand. \u201cWe knew exactly what would happen if we just walked away,\u201d Zybach, an experienced forester with a PhD in environmental science, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Zybach spent two decades as a reforestation contractor before heading to graduate school in the 1990s. Then the Clinton administration in 1994 introduced its plan to protect old growth trees and spotted owls by strictly limiting logging. Less logging also meant government foresters weren\u2019t doing as much active management of forests \u2014 thinnings, prescribed burns and other activities to reduce wildfire risk.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Greta Thunberg, the Democrats, and the rest of the green movement have zero credibility on the issue of trees and forest management or global greening generally.\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, can \u2014 and should \u2014 clean up on this issue and make it their own.\n\nIn a world where almost everyone seems to be obsessed with environmental fake news, here is a worthwhile and genuine green cause that conservatives can embrace and be seen to embrace.\n\nIt needs to be done sensibly. For example, as Matt Ridley notes in a separate article for the Telegraph, the world doesn\u2019t simply need more trees. It needs the right kind of tree in the right place.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, for example, we don\u2019t want any more of the grim sitka spruce or lodgepole pine trees planted as part of some hare-brained scheme by the Forestry Commission.\n\nThe woodlands we want are not closed-canopy forests of trees all the same age, but patchy woods with glades where oaks can spread their branches, while scrubby birch, hawthorn and rowan jostle with bracken and heather for sunlight, views can be glimpsed from hill tops and butterflies dance in the sunny clearings.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not a question of planting new trees but preserving some of the old ones we already have.\n\nFor example, it is quite ludicrous that American hardwood forests are being chopped down to be chipped and turned into \u201cbiofuel\u201d and shipped across the Atlantic so that the Drax power station in Britain can meet its carbon emissions reductions targets.\n\nThere\u2019s also the major problem of tree diseases like the Xylella fastidiosa ravaging citrus trees in the U.S. and olive groves in southern Italy. Imagine if some of the millions of dollars currently being squandered on politically-driven research into climate change could instead be directed towards the much more pressing and real problem of tree disease.\n\nAs I\u2019ve argued before here is an easy way for President Trump to stop his enemies outflanking him on green issues. By becoming saviour of the world\u2019s trees he can:\n\nClaim to be leading the way on CO2 reduction. (It doesn\u2019t matter if you believe CO2 is a problem or not. Greenies do. And trees sequestrate \u2018carbon\u2019.\n\nGet all the other world leaders on board, so they\u2019ve something positive to talk about at all those summits\n\nGive greenie protestors something useful to do: plant trees\n\nAnnoy the hell out of the Democrats and all those other groups that want to paint Trump as a heartless, uncaring, planet destroying capitalist.\n\nActually, genuinely help save the planet.\n\nOthers are thinking the same thing as me:\n\nWE CAN CHANGE THE PLANET!! @realDonaldTrump YOU would love this project!! REFORESTATION.. The game everybody wins..:) \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udf33#treesarelife pic.twitter.com/rkKn5TwAkJ \u2014 Kirstie Alley (@kirstiealley) October 3, 2019\n\nJust imagine how glorious it could be if our PRESIDENT @realDonaldTrump put you in charge of a global effort to re-forest! We could call it Trump Trees! charge a dollar each, donor get a certificate, you get to reforest the world and Trump becomes an environmental/climate hero! \u2014 NYgrandma (@grandma4all) October 3, 2019\n\nGo for it, Mr President. It\u2019s a win, win, win situation. And I think you may have mentioned on occasion: you quite like winning, don\u2019t you?", "description": "School drop-out and global irritant Greta Thunberg has found yet another cause to badger us with: saving the world's trees.", "authors": ["James Delingpole"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/greta-sign-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
