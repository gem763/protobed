Down below in the darkness, all six of Japan\u2019s fleet carriers\u2014the Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, Shokaku, and Zuikaku\u2014were grouped 200 miles north of Hawaii.\n\nThe attack force included Val dive bombers, Kate level bombers, and Kate torpedo aircraft\u2014all escorted by feared Zero fighters. As Fuchida watched and waited for his strike force to assemble in the air, his thoughts no doubt centered on the details of the coming attack and its prospects for success, and probably did not extend back to the decades of misunderstandings and miscalculations that had led to this fateful moment. It is worthwhile, however, to consider them here.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "A major strategic blunder.", "authors": ["Warfare History Network"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ou4.Pyf4R5HwJ0CGHMCLIw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/f998e9b5c94a7a66bbccce01e2ad1525", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
