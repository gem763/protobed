According to Bloomberg, either Trump spoke prematurely or Xi Jinping has tried to play games once again. China won\u2019t sign the \u201cphase one\u201d deal without more negotiations, Bloomberg reports this morning, leaving the status of talks unclear:\n\nChina wants further talks as soon as the end of October to hammer out the details of the \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal touted by Donald Trump before Xi Jinping agrees to sign it, according to people familiar with the matter. Beijing may send a delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He, China\u2019s top negotiator, to finalize a written deal that could be signed by the presidents at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next month in Chile, one of the people said. Another person said China wants Trump to also scrap a planned tariff hike in December in addition to the hike scheduled for this week, something the administration hasn\u2019t yet endorsed. The people asked not to be named discussing the private negotiations. The details of the verbal agreement reached in Washington last week between the two nations remain unclear. While Trump hailed an increase in agricultural purchases as \u201cthe greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,\u201d China\u2019s state-run media only said the two sides \u201cagreed to make joint efforts toward eventually reaching an agreement.\u201d\n\nThis looks similar to the chain of events that led to rapid-fire tariff hikes between the two nations. At one point, Trump thought he had an agreement with China to reset trade and intellectual-property policies, only to have Xi yank the rug out from underneath him by withdrawing almost all of the concessions. At the time, it was thought that Xi wanted to take Trump\u2019s measure and got surprised when Trump immediately escalated the fight.\n\nPerhaps the amount of surprise might have been overstated at the time. If Xi tried making the same play over the weekend, he won\u2019t have any right to claim surprise over what might come next, as Jonathan Swan points out:\n\nIf what Bloomberg is reporting becomes Beijing\u2019s position \u2014 and narrative becomes that Chinese played Trump \u2014 trade war will likely resume with extra @realDonaldTrump determination to screw them. https://t.co/5XvdqcwFSL \u2014 Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 14, 2019\n\nBut was this a deal at all, or did Trump overstate progress as an actual breakthrough? For China, the phasing Trump offered presents internal problems for Xi. While China has offered separate deals in areas of trade, it wants all of the punitive tariffs lifted first:\n\nFor Xi, it\u2019s seen as politically unfeasible to accept a final deal that doesn\u2019t remove the punitive tariffs altogether. Nationalists in the Communist Party have pressured him to avoid signing an \u201cunequal treaty\u201d reminiscent of those China signed with colonial powers. \u201cThe U.S. must concede on its December tariff threat if they want sign a deal during APEC summit, otherwise it would be a humiliating treaty for China,\u201d said Huo Jianguo, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now vice chairman of the China Society For World Trade Organization Studies. \u201cThe U.S. has definitely shown some good gestures but we shouldn\u2019t exclude the possibility of another flip-flop.\u201d\n\nThat might have been why the Chinese didn\u2019t talk up the prospects of this deal right from the get-go. Their state media apparently never mentioned that a deal had been reached, and even warned the US about getting over its skis, as well as Trump using any potential misunderstanding to escalate the trade war:\n\nChinese state media warned the U.S. over the weekend to \u201cavoid backpedaling\u201d on the partial trade agreement, and expressed caution about the initial phase of the deal which President Donald Trump called \u201cvery substantial.\u201d \u2026 \u201cWhile the negotiations do appear to have produced a fundamental understanding on the key issues and the broader benefits of friendly relations, the Champagne should probably be kept on ice, at least until the two presidents put pen to paper,\u201d said China Daily on Sunday. \u2026 \u201cAs based on its past practice, there is always the possibility that Washington may decide to cancel the deal if it thinks that doing so will better serve its interests,\u201d China Daily said. \u201cThe US should avoid backpedaling, as it has in the past, and instead cherish what has been achieved as a manifestation of a healthy and steady China-US relationship that serves the interests of both countries and the world,\u201d it said.\n\nXinhua also never claimed that a deal had been struck:\n\nXinhua report says the two sides made \u201csubstantial progress,\u201d but does not say a deal was reached. If both sides don\u2019t think there is a deal, there\u2019s no deal. https://t.co/UihEqcrMmU \u2014 Scott Kennedy (@KennedyCSIS) October 11, 2019\n\nAnd investors in the West didn\u2019t see it as a deal, either:\n\nWall Street analysts were largely skeptical of Trump\u2019s announcement on Friday of a substantial trade deal, as Evercore ISI strategists noted that it \u201cfocused on the low-hanging fruit, with a lot vague or not addressed.\u201d \u2026 China\u2019s trade negotiators want to meet for more talks in the next couple of weeks, people familiar with the matter told CNBC\u2019s Kayla Tausche on Monday. Before Chinese President Xi Jinping signs the \u201cphase one\u201d trad agreement, the nation\u2019s negotiators want to add more detail. Credit Suisse doubts this \u201cmini-deal\u201d will lead to the end of the U.S. trade war with China, saying it sees \u201cdaunting obstacles\u201d to a full resolution. But Credit Suisse does see some good news in the early agreement.\n\nSo perhaps Xi doesn\u2019t want to sign the \u201cphase one\u201d accord because there\u2019s nothing yet to sign. Neverthless, Trump spent yesterday promoting the agreement and claimed that China had already begun purchasing \u201cvery large quantities\u201d of agricultural products from \u201cOUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS & RANCHERS\u201d:\n\n\u2026.I agreed not to increase Tariffs from 25% to 30% on October 15th. They will remain at 25%. The relationship with China is very good. We will finish out the large Phase One part of the deal, then head directly into Phase Two. The Phase One Deal can be finalized & signed soon! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nCHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS & RANCHERS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nIt sounds like both Trump and China are playing wheels-within-wheels games in these negotiations. Nothing is certain until pen meets paper, and even then, China has shown an amazing amount of, er, flexibility when it comes to meeting the terms of international agreements.", "description": "\"...the Champagne should probably be kept on ice, at least until the two presidents put pen to paper.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trump-xi-handshake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
