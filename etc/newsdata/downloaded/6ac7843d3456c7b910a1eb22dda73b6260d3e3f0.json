Frankfurt, Vancouver and Paris are in bubble risk territory, too, with low interest rates considered the main driver in European cities in particular, the investment bank said.\n\n\n\nUBS\n\n\u201cOn a global level, economic uncertainty is outweighing the effect of falling interest rates on urban housing demand,\u201d Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in the report. \u201cHowever, in parts of the Eurozone, low rates have still helped to push real estate valuations into bubble risk territory.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cbubble\u201d refers to a \u201csubstantial and sustained mispricing of an asset, the existence of which cannot be proved unless it bursts,\u201d according to UBS.\n\n\n\nBut none of the five U.S. cities analyzed in the index are considered to be at risk.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: How Not to Lose Money When Flipping a House\n\nThough strong employment and income growth have helped push up prices in California, strained affordability and falling international demand have capped price growth in San Francisco and Los Angeles, the report said.\n\n\n\nThe Boston housing market has benefited from its good affordability and economic appeal for businesses and high-income earners.\n\n\n\nIn New York, affordability issues and an unfavorable tax treatment have led to declining home values, according to UBS.\n\n\n\nAnd in Chicago, the only city in the report to be considered undervalued, weak economic development has led to price increases of less than 20% since 2000.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Liz Lucking"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-112326?size=1.5005861664712778&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
