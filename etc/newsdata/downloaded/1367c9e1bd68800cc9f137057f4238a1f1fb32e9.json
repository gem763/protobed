That\u2019s why we\u2019re tackling Things We Don\u2019t Talk About, a series in which we track down the best hygiene-, sex-, and bodily function\u2013related things we all need but might be too embarrassed to ask about. In this installment, we consult experts on the proper way to clean your ears.\n\nCleaning your ears is often a private, gross moment between you and a Q-tip, but according to ENTs, if you know what\u2019s good for you, you\u2019d stop fussing with your ears completely. Maura Cosetti \u2014 an otolaryngologist at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai \u2014 explains that wax already self-regulates, and even carries health benefits. \u201cHaving wax is a sign of a healthy ear. It combines lubricating, antibacterial, and even antifungal properties. It\u2019s not like brushing your teeth, or something you have to think about cleaning all the time. It\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe real cause for concern is when ear wax becomes impacted, partly blocking the ear canal and causing symptoms like ringing in the ears (tinnitus), hearing loss, or pain. For what it\u2019s worth, it\u2019s often caused by people digging around in there in the first place. Here, we talk to Cosetti and otolaryngologist Eric Smouha of ENT and Allergy Associates about how you can gently clean your ears at home if you sense you have a blockage.\n\nBaby Muslin Washcloths $12 (was $24, now 50% off) \u201cEar wax normally forms in the ear canal and finds its way to the surface. If it gets to the surface, it\u2019s okay to swab around there with a soft washcloth or something along those lines,\u201d says Smouha. A soft muslin baby washcloth will be small and soft enough to do the trick. Cosetti says that even using a Q-tip is helpful here so long as you\u2019re guiding it along the outer part of the ear or the opening of the ear canal, but making sure not to prod it inside. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nSwan Hydrogen Peroxide (Pack of 2) There are also a dozen different metal tools, swabs, and syringes that can be purchased for clearing your ears, but for issues like swimmer\u2019s ear (when water gets trapped behind the wax) or blockages, Cosetti says ear drops should be your first call to action before buying anything that involves inserting something into your ear canal. \u201cDrops are both more effective and safer.\u201d She says you can either work with something over the counter or a homemade solution. \u201cThe environment of your ear is naturally acidic, so it\u2019s usually a good idea to use some sort of acidic solution or a mixture. I have a lot of my patients use a half-and-half alcohol solution with alcohol and water, or hydrogen peroxide and water. Apple-cider vinegar is a really good idea to use, too.\u201d $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nDebrox Removal Aid Drops $6 (was $7, now 14% off) Smouha also suggests using over-the-counter ear drops to help dislodge wax, but sparingly. \u201cUsing things like Debrox once or twice is fine, but most of those drops have peroxide, which can irritate the skin. It\u2019s fine to use it if the wax comes out, but if the solution sits around in the ear canal, skin can become macerated like if you\u2019ve been in the bathtub too long.\u201d $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nHand Bulb Ear Syringe A more ambitious person might try solutions like syringes and systems that flush out the ear, which Smouha says are fine if people are exercising caution, \u201cbut if it doesn\u2019t work the first time, it\u2019s probably better to see a doctor and not persist.\u201d To administer an at-home solution, you can use a bulb syringe to pump a little bit into your ear canal, but remember to avoid jamming the tip directly into your ear. You can work around this by tipping your head to one side and squeezing your solution directly above the ear-canal entrance. $5 at Amazon Buy $5 at Amazon Buy\n\nElephant Ear Washer Bottle System $30 (was $36, now 17% off) Here\u2019s another popular ear-irrigation system, developed by a doctor, that might be helpful. It uses a hose attached to a spray bottle to flush your ear with water or a solution of your choice to soften up the wax. $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nGrafco Goldnamer Ear Basin Some people who are using syringes and ear drops also find that it\u2019s helpful to have one of these ear basins handy, which fits under the ear to collect any wax buildup or excess liquid that might come tumbling out. $12 at Amazon Buy $12 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
