On Saturday, The New York Times reported that a victim and classmate of Kavanaugh's alleged that a drunken college-aged Kavanaugh exposed his genitals to her at a party. The only problem with this was that the NYT left out a key detail from the new book, \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh,\" which the op-ed was adapted from. The \"victim\" says she never remembered something like that happening. Here's the correction the NYT had to issue, as Katie reported:\n\nOver the weekend the New York Times published a bogus story falsely accusing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of additional misconduct while in college. After being called out on the facts, the paper issued a correction on their story and admitted the claims of sexual misconduct weren't remembered by the alleged \"victim.\" Instead, the claims were made up and pushed to the media by a Washington D.C. attorney close to the Clintons. Editors\u2019 Note: Sept. 15, 2019\n\nAn earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book's account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.\n\nAs Katie noted, \"Before the correction, the false NYT story prompted a number of 2020 Democrats to further smear Kavanaugh and call for his impeachment.\"\n\nAs of writing, no Democrat has retracted their impeachment demand. But, why hasn't House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler made any sort of indication he is going to seek potential proceedings against the SCOTUS justice? Well, it's because the House is simply too busy trying to remove President Donald J. Trump from office.\n\n\"We have our hands full with impeaching the president right now and that's going to take up our limited resources and time for a while,\" Nadler said on Monday on a radio show, according to Politico. When asked why Trump must be impeached, despite no evidence of any violation of the law, Nadler said he must be impeached to send a message to the nation.\n\n\"In my personal opinion, impeachment is imperative not because he's going to be removed from office \u2014 the Senate won't do that \u2014 but because we have to vindicate the Constitution,\" he added. \"We have to show that the kind of self-dealing enrichment that this president is engaged in ... that the kind of public corruption he's been involved in, that the kind of obstruction of justice that the Mueller report documented \u2014 five instances of which met all the requirements for an indictment and the president would have been indicted for those five instances had the Justice Department not had a policy of not indicting presidents no matter what -- we have to show that this kind of behavior \u2026 cannot be normalized.\"\n\nSo in short, Nadler says House Democrats cannot waste taxpayer money trying to get rid of Kavanaugh because they are too busy wasting taxpayer money trying to embarrass Trump.
