When this play opened in 1967, it was taboo-busting. It still is.\n\nIt uses hate-crime words such as \u2018spastic\u2019, \u2018weirdie\u2019 and \u2018vegetable\u2019. Where you might have expected dignified solemnity, it blows a big fat raspberry.\n\nBri is a gravy-stained teacher, played here by Toby Stephens, who has inherited his lip-curling sardonic talent from his parents Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens. He opens the play by making us, his unruly pupils, sit there with our hands on heads in silence. That\u2019ll teach us!\n\nPeter Nichols died last month, aged 92, and this production of his play A Day In The Death Of Joe Egg is a timely tribute to a truly fearless dramatist. Above: Toby Stephens & Patricia Hodge\n\nHe arrives home wanting sex with his wife Sheila \u2013 Claire Skinner, star of the sitcom Outnumbered \u2013 who is waiting for their wheelchair-bound daughter to get home from school.\n\nSheila loves her daughter deeply. But Bri can\u2019t, because she\u2019s unknowable, crippled and in his way. The play shows their marriage creaking under the strain of their daughter\u2019s needs, pathetic yelps and fits.\n\nThe author is Peter Nichols, who died aged 92 last month (he also wrote Privates On Parade and The National Health). Joe Egg is loosely autobiographical, in that he and his wife cared for their brain-damaged daughter, who died aged 11 after much suffering.\n\nIndeed, the spectre of euthanasia finds its way into this inventive, jet-black comedy. The couple shield themselves with a jokey double act, doing cartoon impersonations of an idiot (male) doctor, an inept paediatrician and a trendy vicar.\n\nIT'S A FACT The controversial play caused a furore in 1967, and the Lord Chamberlain suggested the child might be \u2018played\u2019 by a dummy.\n\nBut for all the vaudeville stuff, you are never far from emotional reality. When Joe Egg seems to die (a false alarm), Bri later asks Sheila: \u2018Did you feel a drop of relief?\u2019 I cannot think of a truer, more intimate moment between two parents in any play.\n\nSkinner radiates a tough tenderness as the mother; Stephens\u2019s Bri is spectacularly childish and awful. He gets it from his mum (played by Patricia Hodge with a game stab at a Bristol accent), who sprinkles malice throughout the second act.\n\nOf their friends, the fascistic Pam (Lucy Eaton) declares she\u2019s not good at anything \u2018NPA\u2019 (non-physically attractive), while her rich socialist husband Freddie (Clarence Smith) dispenses unwanted advice by the yard.\n\nJoe is played by Storme Toolis, who is adult-sized, disabled and a very charming stage presence. But having a disabled actor in the role means we never see the great moment when Joe Egg gets up out of her chair and skips in a fantasy glimpse of a normal childhood.\n\nSimon Evans\u2019s polished production isn\u2019t as funny as I remember and perhaps a bit dated too. But it reveals a wonderful, if agonising, play \u2013 and it is a timely tribute to a truly fearless dramatist.\n\nTwo Ladies\n\nBridge Theatre, London Until October 26, 1hr 40mins\n\nRating:\n\nOccasionally a new play comes along \u2013 like this one \u2013 that is something to park one\u2019s bottom in front of and just enjoy.\n\nIt stars the ever-brilliant Zo\u00eb Wanamaker and the Croatian actress Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107.\n\nThey play two presidential First Ladies, of France and the US respectively. The venue is a corporate glass building in the South of France where an anti-terrorism summit is taking place. For each woman the job is to smile sweetly and stand by their man, like Tammy Wynette.\n\nNancy Harris's new play, Two Ladies, is pacy, gripping and crisply acted by the ever brilliant Zo\u00eb Wanamaker (above) and Zrinka Cvite\u0161i\u0107 playing the first ladies of France and the US\n\nNancy Harris\u2019s play is intelligent but you\u2019d never accuse it of being plausible. It comes with an enjoyably daft ending that you wouldn\u2019t get in even the most outrageous airport thriller.\n\nWanamaker plays Helen, clearly based on President Macron\u2019s wife; she confesses she was sexually enthralled by his gorgeous body when she might have been better off tending to her career.\n\nAs Sophia, Cvite\u0161i\u0107\u2019s Melania Trump-like character has an East European accent, and the elegant equipoise of a very expensive desk lamp.\n\nThis despite the fact that her designer outfit has animal blood all over it \u2013 chucked at her by protesters. Dabbing herself with paper napkins, she seems calm, cynical and shrewd, but totally vulnerable.\n\nWanamaker\u2019s Helen is kind but clearly suspicious of her counterpart\u2019s illiberal views, and more than anything she\u2019s gagging for a drink. They both suffer interruptions from a bossy press officer (Lorna Brown) whose backstory is shoehorned into the script.\n\nSlowly the ice between the two women melts; after all, both their husbands \u2013 who remain offstage throughout \u2013 are an adulterous pair of entitled, callous sods whose crisis summit promises an escalation of global violence.\n\nAs these two presidential wives bond over the ever-smiling banality of their lives, a desperate idea takes hold. A cataclysmic ending involves a bottle of Chanel No 5 and a message to the world \u2013 in lipstick!\n\nNicholas Hytner directs this yarn with briskness (there\u2019s no interval) in an evening that has the flavour of a Netflix pilot episode.\n\nIt\u2019s not a play that\u2019s ever going to make it on to the school syllabus. But who cares? It\u2019s pacy, gripping and crisply acted.\n\n\n\n\n\nIan McKellen On Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare Others And You\n\nHarold Pinter Theatre, London Until January 5, 2hrs 25mins\n\nSir Ian McKellen\u2019s epic tour of his one-man show ended up recently in Orkney.\n\nIt\u2019s been such a hit that he is now back in the West End. Fans can expect generous quantities of Gandalf gossip and a chance to go up on stage.\n\nThere\u2019s lots about his northern roots and a childhood trip to Peter Pan. \u2018They said clap if you believe in fairies\u2026 I\u2019ve been clapping ever since,\u2019 he twinkles.\n\nSir Ian McKellen's epic tour has been such a hit that he is now back in the West End. It's a truly remarkable performance and essentially the autobiography Sir Ian never got around to writing\n\nThe first half has loads of career anecdotage. But in the second it\u2019s like watching an amazing memory man.\n\nHe declaims a vast chunk of the tongue-twisting poet Gerard Manley Hopkins plus reams of Shakespeare \u2013 the delighted audience shouting out requests.\n\nThis truly remarkable performance \u2013 entirely in aid of theatre charities \u2013 is really the autobiography Sir Ian never got around to writing.\n\nGlass. Kill. Bluebeard. Imp.\n\nRoyal Court Theatre, London Until Saturday, 2hrs 20mins\n\nRating:\n\nThis is a quartet of experimental quickies by the veteran dramatist Caryl Churchill. Glass is about a fragile girl made of glass.\n\nIt\u2019s OK but not as good as the Tommy Cooper story about the neon-tube-swallowing man who made the fatal mistake of taking a bow.\n\nKill has a Greek god (Tom Mothersdale) smoking a fag on a cloud and explaining the relentless bloodiness of Greek mythology.\n\nOut of this quartet of experimental works by Caryl Churchill, Imp is by far the best and most unsettling. Toby Jones (above) and Deborah Findlay are brilliant in it as Jimmy and Dot\n\nThere\u2019s more male violence in Bluebeard. Former friends of the multiple wife-murderer chat and guzzle wine. One tweets: \u2018Horrified to learn my friend Bluebeard is a serial killer.\u2019 I took it as a barbed attack on the revolting virtue signalling of the #MeToo crowd in theatreland.\n\nImp \u2013 the best and most unsettling piece \u2013 concerns Jimmy (Toby Jones, a grumpy delight) and Dot. She\u2019s brilliantly acted by Deborah Findlay, who absolutely convinced me that the imp in a corked bottle by her chair was real and must never be released.\n\nThe plays come with two very agreeable interludes involving a juggler and an acrobat.\n\nBut have they been chucked in because the first three of these pieces aren\u2019t quite entertaining enough?\n\nMacbeth\n\nChichester Festival Theatre Until October 26, 2hrs 50mins\n\nRating:\n\nThe real curse of Macbeth is that so often it doesn\u2019t really work. This has the excellent John Simm and Dervla Kirwan \u2013 yet it comes across as utterly un-hair-raising. Even the witches are friendly and scamper sweetly.\n\nSimm is clear, cool and very calm; Kirwan ditto. Both give perfectly fine performances, but there\u2019s little sense of conspiracy or erotic undertow between them.\n\nWhile John Simm (above) and Dervla Kirwan both give perfectly fine performances, Chichester Festival Theatre's production of Macbeth is overall short of blood, passion and pace\n\nThe cold design comes with lavish screen projections and ambient music. Clods of earth are visible below a circular glass stage but it feels like a very corporate space, where no ravens croak.\n\nOf a variable cast, only Stuart Laing stands out as a formidable Banquo. The best scenes come at the end, when Simm makes Macbeth\u2019s utter burnout (\u2018Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\u2026\u2019) visible before our eyes.\n\nPaul Miller\u2019s production is short on blood, passion and pace. If, as I did, you come out of a Macbeth without a shiver, then it hasn\u2019t done its job.\n\nThe King Of Hell's Palace\n\nHampstead Theatre, London Until Saturday, 2hrs 30mins\n\nRating:\n\nWhat do you get when there\u2019s an escape at a Chinese zoo? Panda-monium. Sorry about that, but this Chinese tragedy is low on jokes.\n\nIn fact it\u2019s a tragedy about the country\u2019s disastrous, for-profit venture into selling blood plasma.\n\nOne minute a peasant family is selling peonies, the next they are opening their veins for cash at local centres.\n\nFrances Ya-Chu Cowhig's play is a tragedy about China's disastrous, for-profit venture into selling blood plasma but despite being well-intentioned, it clunks with too many facts\n\nThe result is a catastrophic outbreak of HIV and hepatitis, with half of this all-Chinese cast developing leopard-like spots.\n\nFrances Ya-Chu Cowhig\u2019s play has a prime role for Celeste Den, who is plausible as Yin Yin (a fictionalised version of the whistleblower Dr Shuping Wang), whose family is predictably punished in the ensuing cover-up.\n\nBut the show clunks with too many facts and under-written characters. It\u2019s staged by Michael Boyd with a treadmill centre stage, on which peasants do a lot of trudging.\n\nThis is a well-intentioned but lame start to Roxana Silbert\u2019s regime at Hampstead.", "description": "This is about two parents coping with a severely brain-damaged child in a wheelchair.
