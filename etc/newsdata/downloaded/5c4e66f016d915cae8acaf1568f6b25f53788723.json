The new victims are thought to have come from the same herd.\n\nThe ravines usually fill up with gushing water during the rainy season.\n\nSompote said that the death toll of 11 is the highest number of elephants to die in a single incident in Khao Yai. Eight elephants died at the same waterfall almost 30 years ago.\n\nThe elephant population at the park is estimated to be about 300.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
