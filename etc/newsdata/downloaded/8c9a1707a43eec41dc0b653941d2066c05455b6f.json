USA TODAY\n\nThe Chicago Bears, with a potentially game-winning kick on the horizon Sunday against the Los Angeles Chargers, had the chance to gain extra yards to make it a little easier for Eddy Pineiro.\n\nInstead, coach Matt Nagy opted for Chicago quarterback Mitchell Trubisky to take a knee after he gained 11 yards on a scramble that got Chicago to the Chargers' 21-yard line. Even though there were 53 seconds left on the clock, Nagy called a quarterback kneel and then used his final timeout with four seconds left in the game to set up a 41-yard kick for Pineiro.\n\nPineiro\u2019s kick appeared to start on target but ten hooked wide left. The Bears lost, 17-16, dropping Chicago to 3-4.\n\nAfter the loss, Nagy stood by his decision.\n\n\"I\u2019ll just be brutally clear: zero thought of throwing the football, zero through of running the football,\" Nagy said. \"You understand me? That\u2019s exactly what it was. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nIt was Pineiro\u2019s second missed field goal of the day. He made three attempts, from 22, 25 and 19 yards away.\n\nThis was just the latest mishap in Chicago\u2019s recent history of kicking. The team is still dealing with the effects of Jannuary's missed \"double-doink\" field goal attempt by Cody Parkey that cost Chicago its chance to advance through the wild-card round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nParkey converted 23 of 30 (76.7%) attempts last season and made three of four tries in that 16-15 wild card round loss. The missed game-winner in last year\u2019s playoffs was partially blocked and then caromed off of the left upright before hitting the crossbar and falling to the turf.\n\nThe Bears later cut Parkey and held an open competition in training camp in which Pineiro was declared the winner.\n\nPineiro, after his two misses Sunday, is now 12 of 15 on the season in field goal tries.\n\n\u201cI really like where we\u2019re at,\u201d Nagy said concerning Pineiro\u2019s future status with the team. \u201cI have ultimate faith in him. I do. It just happens to be in our situation it gets completely magnified because of where we\u2019ve been before, but I have ultimate trust in him. He\u2019s going to be the first to tell you that he wants to come back out here and he wants another opportunity at that shot, at that kick. All we can do is next time we get that opportunity, he puts it right down the middle.\u201d\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
