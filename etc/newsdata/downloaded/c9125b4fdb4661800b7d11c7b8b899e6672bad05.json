According to the statement, there were two judges in Chambers to attend to urgent matters \u2013 Judges NC Erasmus and PAL Gamble.\n\nGamble said he was the only judge dealing with the applications.\n\n\"At no stage did the applications serve before either Judge Erasmus or any other Judge of this Division. The matters were dealt with by Judge Gamble from start to finish,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Judge Gamble does not know Minister Pravin Gordhan and has never met him in either his official or personal capacity. Neither the Minister nor his department were, in any event, parties to the proceedings.\"\n\nSurv\u00e9 announced on Friday that Sekunjalo intends to sue the FCSA and a number of other people for the raids. The regulator responded to say it had not received any motion from Sekunjalo, but \"should the threatened legal action materialise, the authority will defend itself\".\n\nGordhan, meanwhile, said in a statement on Thursday the Independent Media boss's attacks on him were characterised by \"malicious, yet nonsensical utterances\".", "description": "A Western Cape High Court judge has taken the unusual step of making a public statement to deny a claim made by businessman Iqbal Surv\u00e9 that he is a friend of the DA and Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan.", "authors": ["Jan Cronje"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9337/300b0eb3d4504511ab5343307f9c35e1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
