We have the ingredients of looming liquidity mismatches across the industry,\u201d said Pascal Blanqu\u00e9, speaking exclusively to MW\u2019s sister title Financial News as part of the Money Masters investing special.\n\nThe CIO\u2019s comments reflect growing concerns that some open-ended funds could suffer the same fate as Woodford by struggling to sell some of their holdings fast enough to pay back investors.\n\nAccording to Blanqu\u00e9, a cause for concern is that banks have reduced their dealer and market making activity following the global financial crisis. Banks have retreated from their past role by scaling back the amount of risk they take in part because of more stringent capital requirements from regulators.\n\nBlanqu\u00e9 said that banks\u2019 diminished ability to absorb liquidity demand during selloff periods could pose wider problems for fund managers.\n\nREAD: Investment boss: Faang is out, Fanmag is in \u2014 and it\u2019s a bubble\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a frantic search for yield on the buy side, pushed by [central banks\u2019 quantitative easing programs],\u201d said Blanqu\u00e9. \u201cThe combination of a frantic search for yield, and the deterioration of market liquidity, can create mismatches.\u201d\n\nBlanqu\u00e9\u2019s comments come as fund liquidity has been thrown into the spotlight following liquidity problems encountered by high profile asset managers including Woodford, H2O and GAM.\n\nIn June, Morningstar suspended its bronze rating on H2O\u2019s Allegro fund due to concerns over the liquidity of bonds linked to Lars Windhorst, the German entrepreneur with a history of bankruptcies. H2O subsequently offloaded a significant chunk of private, nonrated debt and removed entry fees in an attempt to stem investor outflows.\n\nWoodford, once a star stock picker in the U.K., was forced to close his investment business on October 16 after being sacked as manager on his flagship \u00a32.9bn Equity Income fund.\n\nLink Fund Solutions, which acts as the authorized corporate director to the Equity Income fund, took the decision to suspend dealing in the vehicle on June 3 to allow some of its most illiquid holdings to be sold to pay back investors wanting to exit.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss asset manager GAM was forced to close several bond funds managed by Haywood to stem investor outflows and sell off some of the products\u2019 most illiquid holdings to pay back investors.\n\nBlanqu\u00e9 said: \u201cThere is a severe underestimation of the effective liquidity of what is supposed to be liquid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the fund level, the regulators are going in the direction where the buy side must be ready to show effective liquidity policies.\n\n\u201cAt the corporate level, we think that asset managers are, generally speaking, under-capitalised relative to the liquidity they may face.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe very concept of liquidity is poorly defined. You will see regulators asking buy side actors to at least be more precise about what they mean by liquidity and explain their crisis management.\u201d\n\nRead more from FN\u2019s Money Masters series, in which elite asset managers tackle 2019\u2019s toughest investing questions \u2014 from Brexit to Trump", "description": "Pascal Blanqu\u00e9 said search for yield and liquidity mismatches a significant risk", "authors": ["David Ricketts"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL072_FN_WOO_ZG_20190610012904.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
