Over its opening weekend in theaters, the film (developed from a 2015 New York article by Jessica Pressler, \u201cThe Hustlers at Scores\u201d) made off with an unexpectedly robust $33.2 million at the box office, surpassing prerelease tracking estimates by more than $8 million. On the astronomically high heels of ecstatic reviews out of the Toronto International Film Festival, where Hustlers premiered last Saturday night, that debut stands as J.Lo\u2019s biggest non-animated movie opening to date, as well as the strongest bow for any film green-lit by Hustlers\u2019 five-year-old distributor, STX Entertainment.\n\n\u201cThe unexpected success of Hustlers is exactly what the industry needs after a summer of disappointing performances by non-franchise, adult-driven dramas that seemingly could not rise above the noise and bombast of their big-budget, franchise-powered counterparts,\u201d says Comcast senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. \u201cThe film\u2019s marketing campaign has been solid from the start. But it\u2019s the rave reviews, star power, and, most importantly, the Zeitgeist buzz that have taken Hustlers to the next level and have made it the rare non-franchise event film.\u201d\n\nAlthough the $20 million comedy-drama \u2014 which features Cardi B and Lizzo as fellow strippers \u2014 couldn\u2019t steal the top spot from It: Chapter Two ($40 million over its second weekend in release), Hustlers\u2019 success arrives as a striking reversal of fortune for a film that came perilously close to not getting made at all. Initially set up at Annapurna Pictures with filmmaker Lorene Scafaria (The Meddler, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) attached as screenwriter, the project was dumped when the Megan Ellison\u2013 studio hit a financial rough patch in October 2018. Scafaria (who wanted to direct the film), Lopez (who was also attached as a producer), and her producing partner Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas had to set off, hats in hand, around Hollywood, pitching new backers on their all-women Robin Hood\u2013meets\u2013Ocean\u2019s 11 crime romp.\n\nOutside of 2012\u2019s Magic Mike (and, to a lesser extent, The Full Monty), films plotted around strippers haven\u2019t fared well at the box office. But thanks to Lopez and Goldsmith-Thomas\u2019s preexisting relationship with STX (which had released the Lopez-starring 2018 dramedy-romance Second Act), the trio found a receptive audience in the studio\u2019s chairman Adam Fogelson. He realized Hustlers\u2019 potential to connect at the multiplex, where so many other male movie executives did not. \u201cWe were intrigued by the opportunity for a female writer-director, primarily female producers, and an almost exclusively female cast to take a based-on-a-true-story look at this world,\u201d Fogelson says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s The Wolf of Wall Street or GoodFellas, people tend to love entertaining crime stories. The fact that the likable criminals were women and not men struck us as only a positive.\u201d\n\nSTX\u2019s unique business formula involves making movies featuring big stars \u201cfor a price\u201d (that is, a low price), then tightly focusing their marketing efforts to spend about half of what other studios have shelled out to promote comparable female-centric films like Ocean\u2019s 8 or Girls Trip. To get Hustlers in front of the widest possible audience this weekend, STX took a four-pronged approach:\n\nPlaying the Cardi B Card\n\nAlthough real-life stripper-turned-rapper Cardi B only delivers a supporting performance, the filmmakers and studio executives felt her participation would play a key component in both establishing Hustlers\u2019 cultural credibility and marketing the film. In Vulture\u2019s oral history of the film, Lopez explained how she personally called the multiplatinum-selling \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d MC and \u201ctold her she had to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the big conversations we had was, \u2018How do you fill out this cast in a way that creates hype around the movie but also creates authenticity for the movie?\u2019\u201d Fogelson says. \u201cEverything you see in terms of Cardi wasn\u2019t originally scripted, because she wasn\u2019t attached to the movie when we took it on.\u201d\n\nMusic created another viral marketing opportunity. \u201cHaving Cardi B\u2019s \u2018Money\u2019 song as the anthem for this film with the connection of her being in it was another huge element,\u201d he says. \u201cI had the benefit of working on the marketing campaign for Eight Mile many years ago. And that Eminem song so clearly became the anthem for the film, you literally didn\u2019t even need to see an image to know that was what was being talked about or sold.\u201d\n\nWhere to Park the Trailer\n\nWhile most movie trailers are unleashed on the internet four to six months prior to a film\u2019s theatrical debut, STX made the relatively risky move not to unveil promotional clips until just a few weeks before Husters\u2019 multiplex rollout. \u201cWe launched the trailer for this movie two months before it came out, which is, by all traditional measures, an impossibly short window of time to get a movie to reach critical mass in the marketplace,\u201d the STX chairman explains. \u201cAlong with the filmmakers, we believed that any longer than that, you were actually going to run the risk of running out of steam. Because there was so much interest and so much enthusiasm for what this film was, how it was being made and who was in it, we believed that compressing it down to this time frame was going to create some sort of maximum sustainable enthusiasm to reach opening day.\u201d\n\nClearly Positioning Hustlers as a Movie About Women by Women\n\nHeading into opening weekend, studio executives correctly predicted the majority of Hustlers\u2019 audience would be women (on Sunday, STX put out an announcement confirming that 67 percent of attendees were female). The marketing team deliberately sidestepped marketing materials showcasing the actresses in barely-there outfits, instead choosing to emphasize the characters\u2019 full-fleshed humanity \u2014 even if that meant avoiding the kind of sexy spectacle that would, under ordinary circumstances, be a marketing go-to. \u201cThe movie is definitely shot from a female point of view,\u201d says Fogelson. \u201cIt does not gratuitously present the world of a strip club, while still actually presenting an authentic and sexy version of it. It\u2019s not a male gaze we are looking through.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have been possible in marketing materials to have very specifically selected certain moments that would have risked not reflecting that vision,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd we wanted to be very careful never to err on the side of oversexualizing what this was.\u201d\n\nNo Reason to be Antisocial\n\nFogelson waves away the idea that stars with giant social-media followings can somehow translate Facebook friends into ticket sales. But it\u2019s impossible to ignore the principal cast\u2019s social clout: Lopez has 100 million followers on Instagram, Cardi B has 50 million on the platform, and Reinhart has 19 million. The trick, the executive explains, is harnessing the actresses\u2019 social engagement to get moviegoers more excited about the movie than they already were.\n\n\u201cWe can go through a laundry list of people who have lots of followers who say, \u2018Come see my movie\u2019 and it doesn\u2019t work out,\u201d the chairman says. \u201cThere is evidence, however, that if you have a movie that people want to see and you have an incredibly sophisticated and socially engaged cast, you can amplify that message and meaningfully contain marketing costs \u2014 to the benefit of all the talent, who in one way or another will participate in the financial success of the film.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cBut if we didn\u2019t have a movie people wanted to see, it wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\u201d", "description": "After coming dangerously close to not being made at all, Lorene Scafaria\u2019s Hustlers proves big for its studio STX \u2014 and Jennifer Lopez.", "authors": ["Chris Lee"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/13/13-hustlers-movie-review.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
