The other fans champion a long-marginalized ethnic group, which produces many of the nation\u2019s great distance runners.\n\nAround 100 fans from the Oromo ethnic group, many of them migrant workers living in Qatar, fly the flag of the once-banned Oromia Liberation Front at every distance race at the championships.\n\nThe world champion in the 5,000 meters, Muktar Edris, seemed to endorse them Monday when he picked up and wore an OLF flag thrown to him by fans after winning gold. That had disappeared when Edris arrived to speak with reporters, draped once again in the Ethiopian national flag.\n\nA team official refused to translate a question from The Associated Press to Edris about the OLF flag, saying: \u201cAthletes only represent their country, not a political party.\u201d\n\nThe divisions between fans were starker in the women\u2019s 10,000 on Saturday, when Sifan Hassan won gold for the Netherlands. She was born in Ethiopia\u2019s Oromia region but left as a teenage refugee before eventually gaining a Dutch passport. The OLF-supporting fans backed her, but others were left cold by an athlete not wearing Ethiopia\u2019s uniform.\n\nAt one stage, a group with the national flag moved down to the front of the stand to cheer Ethiopia\u2019s runners, antagonizing the nearby OLF supporters. Qatari police moved in to keep the groups separate as they called to each other.\n\nThe Oromo are the largest of Ethiopia\u2019s numerous ethnic groups, but have historically had little influence in the ruling classes, though the reformist Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed is Oromo.\n\nIn recent months, several parts of Ethiopia have experienced deadly unrest fueled by ethnic tensions and disputes over resources. In the past week, Ethiopian officials disclosed more than 1,100 people were killed in the unrest that is putting a strain on the reforms the new prime minister is taking in the East African nation.\n\nThe OLF previously waged guerrilla war against the Ethiopian state and remains controversial after its official return to the country last year by invitation of the new Ethiopian government. OLF members kept their arms and some have allegedly continued to commit violent acts amid a split between the group\u2019s political and military wings.\n\nThe OLF says its members were not treated well after their return home last year and the government is still harassing their members.\n\nIn the Khalifa International Stadium, some Oromo fans were resentful of the group waving old-style national flags, accusing them of ties to the Ethiopian embassy and of wanting a return to the monarchy, which Ethiopia abolished 45 years ago.\n\n\u201cThis is Oromia,\u201d said Kemal Ketubo, in the crowd with the OLF flags. \u201cWe are supporting our team, the national team of our people.\u201d Gesturing to the group with Ethiopian national flags, he said \u201cthey want the 18th century, like it was before.\u201d\n\nFans waving Ethiopian flags dismissed the division. Zerhuan Lanta said the championships should be a moment of unity for Ethiopia, where distance running is by far the most popular sport.\n\n\u201cEvery moment, you have to watch,\u201d said Lanta. The divisions among the fans were just \u201ca political issue,\u201d he added.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Elias Meseret in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Ethiopian supporters are the loudest in the stadium at the track world championships - because they're trying to drown each other out.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/qatar_athletics_worlds_69917_c0-160-5916-3609_s1770x1032.jpg?af30e96e9bd54ace036c662b4c068af1b830f7f8"}
