The calculus is simple: If Fox starts allowing more anti-Trump conservatives to voice concerns about the president\u2019s behavior, it clears the way for conservative House members and senators to express doubts of their own without having to worry about a conservative media backlash.\n\nJoe Walsh, a former Republican congressman and radio host now running a long-shot primary bid against Trump, told POLITICO that current members look to Fox News for signs of what\u2019s acceptable conservative dialogue.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t fear Trump. They fear his voters,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cThey know his voters digest Fox News every day, so they toe the line with what Fox News is doing [and] put out crap about the \u2018deep state\u2019 and all this other stuff they really don\u2019t believe in.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Pro-Trump voices dominate the conversation, especially in the morning and evening hours, though several of the network\u2019s anchors and analysts have scrutinized claims by the president and his allies that would likely go unchecked \u2014 or get endorsed by \u2014 by supportive hosts and guests.\n\nFor instance, \u201cFox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace challenged White House adviser Stephen Miller\u2019s baseless accusation that the whistleblower who sparked the Ukraine scandal is a \u201cdeep state operative.\u201d At one point, Wallace dubbed Miller\u2019s evasive answers \u201can exercise in obfuscation.\u201d\n\nBut Miller found a more receptive audience Tuesday night on Fox Business, telling host Lou Dobbs that the \u201cfake whistleblower\u201d is part of a plot to \u201coverthrow\u201d the president. \u201cThe deep state,\u201d Dobbs responded, is \u201cnot only entrenched, but expanding and increasingly powerful.\u201d\n\nSuch assertions, often reinforced with Trump tweets and online messaging, make the jobs of Fox\u2019s news reporters more difficult.\n\n\u201cThe right-wing opinion hosts are essentially selling snake oil and clickbait with nonsense to support the president,\u201d said Carl Cameron, who spent two decades at Fox News and recently launched progressive news site Front Page Live.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, Cameron praised Fox news anchors such as Wallace, Shep Smith and Bret Baier and said that journalists at the network are \u201cconstantly battling the falsehoods that the right-wing opinion hosts are throwing out there.\u201d\n\nRelatively few Republicans have offered criticism of the president surrounding impeachment, but they\u2019ve often struggled to get their views acknowledged by Fox. Illinois Rep Adam Kinzinger stood out in calling Trump\u2019s invoking of the Civil War to describe his plight as \u201cbeyond repugnant.\u201d Kinzinger\u2019s comment was covered on Baier\u2019s 6 p.m. newscast, though not on Fox News\u2019s prime-time shows.\n\nWalsh suggests conservative critics of Trump, like himself, aren\u2019t getting enough airtime on the network. The former congressman has called for impeaching Trump this past week on MSNBC and CNN, but hasn\u2019t scored an invite from Fox News. He last appeared on Fox Business in August in a contentious segment in which he and host Stuart Varney sparred over whether Trump has ever lied.\n\n\u201cI do believe more and more Republicans deep down are tired of this guy and are tired of his bullshit,\u201d added Walsh. \u201cThey\u2019re just afraid to publicly come out and say that.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment echoes former Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s contention that at least 35 Republican Senators would vote to impeach Trump if they could do so privately.\n\nAnother Republican primary challenger, Mark Sanford, hasn\u2019t expressed support for impeachment but said he wants the allegations against Trump investigated. Sanford has appeared on MSNBC and CNN since the Ukraine scandal broke, but not Fox News. He last appeared on the network on Sept. 11.\n\nOnce a paid Fox News contributor, the former South Carolina governor and congressman said he doesn\u2019t expect such a role again given his criticism of Trump and now exists in \u201csomething of a media no-man\u2019s land.\u201d In an interview, Sanford struck traditional Republican notes around debts, deficits and free-market competition, and lamented that some policy views coming from the White House and echoed by Fox hosts and others are \u201canything but conservative.\u201d\n\nTrump presumably isn\u2019t concerned about having conservative policy debates on Fox News as Democrats pursue an impeach inquiry. He tends to promote praise for him and his administration, and on Sunday amplified a portion of on-air remarks from a supporter, Pastor Robert Jeffress, to warn of a \u201cCivil War-like fracture\u201d if he\u2019s removed from office.\n\nThe president also aggressively pushes back against perceived slights. He fired off more than 20 tweets and retweets on Sunday featuring criticism of Fox News reporter Ed Henry after he asked commentator Mark Levin if he was OK with Trump wanting Ukraine\u2019s president \u201cto dig up dirt\u201d on the Bidens.\n\n\u201cYour question is not honest,\u201d said Levin, a prominent conservative radio host who also has a weekend show on Fox News. Levin proceeded to accuse the media of lying, with \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Pete Hegseth, a reliable Trump booster, adding \u201cthe press is entirely uninterested in the other side.\u201d\n\nThe intramural spat was one of several to play out on air. Conservative radio host Jordan Sekulow said Monday morning on Fox News that Wallace\u2019s questioning of Miller was \u201cunfair\u201d because the White House adviser isn\u2019t an attorney. Sekulow\u2019s father, Jay Sekulow, is Trump\u2019s lawyer and appeared that night on \u201cHannity,\u201d along with the president\u2019s most visible attorney: Rudy Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani has accused Biden of corruption, suggesting the former vice president sought the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to benefit his son Hunter\u2019s business interests in the country; there is no evidence to support Giuliani\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cHow much in the tank and how corrupt this media has become,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThey have corruption staring them in the face and they close their eyes to it and then they make up charges against President Trump that aren\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nThe next morning on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade said that despite some \u201csensationalistic headlines\u201d over impeachment \u201cthere\u2019s almost no there there.\u201d\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nLater that hour, senior judicial analyst Anthony Napolitano dismissed the allegations against Biden. \u201cProsecutors in Ukraine and even prosecutors here in the United States say there\u2019s no there there,\u201d he said.\n\nNapolitano, a libertarian conservative, also diverged last week from the pro-Trump stable, suggesting to anchor Shep Smith that Trump committed a crime when he urged Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate the Bidens. Joe diGenova, a Trump-supporting lawyer who has made dozens of appearances this year on Fox News and Fox Business, called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d hours later on \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d\n\nSmith, who hosts the 3 p.m. news hour, said the next day that it was \u201crepugnant\u201d for diGenova, a \u201cpartisan\u201d guest on an \u201copinion\u201d show, to attack a Fox News colleague for offering legal assessments. Carlson swung back, saying it \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem honest\u201d for a host to assert Napolitano\u2019s view isn\u2019t an opinion.\n\nDiGenova also disputed Wallace\u2019s report Sunday that he and his wife, Victoria Toensing, were \u201cworking off the books\u201d with Giuliani \u201cto get oppo research on Biden.\u201d\n\nIn an interview Monday on WBAL, diGenova said Wallace\u2019s report was \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d DiGenova said Giuliani asked him and Toensing to represent Ukrainian \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d but said the trip to Ukraine was \u201ccanceled\u201d and the pair \u201cwere never representing.\u201d Wallace stood by his reporting.\n\nThe on-air fissures haven\u2019t gone unnoticed across the cable dial. Rick Wilson, a Republican operative and Trump critic, said Monday on MSNBC that Wallace and Smith \u201cmust be pretty lonely over at Fox these days, because the rest of the network is blasting out deep state conspiracy theory propaganda 24/7 right now.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday morning, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough mocked Rivera's description of Hannity as a bulwark between Trump and impeachment.\n\n\u201cWas that a compliment?\u201d Scarborough asked. \u201cYou know, if Al Capone had had somebody like you, Sean. ... I mean, c\u2019mon are you kidding me?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e7/77/688efcfc4382b607fb8c5348f4d6/20191002-sean-hannity-ap-773.jpg"}
