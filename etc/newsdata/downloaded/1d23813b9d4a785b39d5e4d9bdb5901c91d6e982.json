There were signs of surrender in that lack of appetite and desire at Brighton. Elements of the absence of fight that Spurs fans have seen before under Andre Villas Boas and Tim Sherwood.\n\nTo be slaughtered last week by a classy Bayern side is one thing, to bottle it at Brighton is quite another.\n\nYet now is not the time for the club to panic. Now is the time for the club to step up their bid to replace the players who won\u2019t commit themselves to the cause.\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nJan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld won\u2019t sign new deals, are out of contract in the summer and can start talking to foreign clubs in January. Spurs have to spend big to replace them. Enough already.\n\nIt is an open secret that Spurs were open to offers for Serge Aurier during the summer while Danny Rose was left in England by Mauricio Pochettino as the squad jetted off for their summer tour.\n\nIs it any surprise that none of their heads are in the game on a consistent basis? Personally I\u2019d keep Rose, on his day still among the best left-backs in the country. Aurier can go.\n\nDele Alli\u2019s form has completely deserted him while Christian Eriksen openly admitted at the end of last season that he wants to play for Real Madrid. What is the Dane still doing at Spurs?\n\n(Image: James Marsh/BPI/REX)\n\nThe Eriksen problem won\u2019t be so difficult to solve once Giovani Lo Celso is fit and ready to take his place in the team. How, though, after Sol Campbell 17 years ago, are Spurs in a situation once again where they could lose one player for free next summer let alone three?\n\nIt is not just the players and the manager that have taken their eye off the ball. Now is the time for chairman Daniel Levy and the board to accept they\u2019ve mucked up. They\u2019ve sought to have it both ways in being willing to sell their stars but slapping on price tags so big that rival clubs decided to wait until they pluck them away for nothing.\n\nFor all that, given Levy and Pochettino\u2019s success in lifting Tottenham\u2019s standing and masterminding that stunning upgrade of their training HQ and that move into the new stadium, now is not the time to reproach them too much just because the going has got tough.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThis column remembers the days when Spurs would have given their teeth to be working towards the current standards they have set for themselves.\n\nThe days when Spurs would have their noses pressed up against the Champions League glass instead of enjoying their fifth consecutive season in European football\u2019s elite competition.\n\nThe days when they couldn\u2019t look down on their friends down the Seven Sisters\u2019 Road who would enjoy St Totteringham\u2019s Day every season.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe days when the Spurs were a shambles under Villas Boas and Sherwood (remember those hidings that season at Chelsea, Liverpool and West Ham?).\n\nPochettino is still the man for the job. Not Max Allegri nor any of the candidates the bookies chuck into a hat to drum up business. If it is the case that Pochettino fancies the Manchester United job then clearly that\u2019s a different matter.\n\nIf his appetite is still there, however, then Spurs must stick with him and replace the players no longer doing it.\n\n(Image: Mark Pain/PA Images Contributor)\n\nEight of the players still in the squad were there when Pochettino arrived. Seven of them played at Brighton on Saturday.\n\nCompare that with just two left from the 2014/15 season at Liverpool and three at Manchester City.\n\nEven if Pochettino were to leave, the squad at Spurs is stale with the rebuilding job not even half done. The next couple of windows will be expensive but very necessary if the club want to retain their seat at the top table.", "description": "Spurs have had a difficult start to the season highlighted by damaging defeats to Bayern Munich and Brighton", "authors": ["Darren Lewis", "Image", "Mark Pain Pa Images Contributor", "James Marsh Bpi Rex", "Getty Images", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20529160.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Brighton-and-Hove-Albion-v-Tottenham-Hotspur-Premier-League-AMEX-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
