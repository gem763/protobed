The Straits Times\n\nSingapore has moved from oil to natural gas for cleaner power generation in the past 50 years, but Singapore\u2019s energy use now needs to be even cleaner for the sake of future generations.\n\nCalling climate change a \u201cchallenge that requires us to change the way we use and produce energy\u201d, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) said in a statement on Tuesday (Oct 29) that Singapore\u2019s energy sector will need to evolve to remain clean and efficient.\n\nMinister for Trade & Industry Chan Chun Sing announced at the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW) 2019 on the same day that Singapore will harness \u201c4 Switches\u201d as part of its energy transformation plan.\n\nRead also: 4 in 10 Singaporeans buy electricity from retailers now \u2013 and their favourites are Ohm Energy, Sunseap Energy and Tuas Power\n\nCurrently, about 95 per cent of Singapore\u2019s electricity is generated using natural gas, which is considered the cleanest fossil fuel at the moment.\n\nBut while natural gas will continue to be a dominant fuel for Singapore in the near future, the nation will also scale up its three other \u201cswitches\u201d so it becomes less reliant on natural gas, EMA said. The Government will also help generation companies improve the efficiency of their power plants, it added.\n\nThe sun will provide enough power for 350,000 households a year\n\nThe second switch is solar energy, which EMA says is \u201cSingapore\u2019s most promising renewable energy source\u201d. The authority added that the Republic is on track to reaching its solar target of 350 megawatt-peak (MWp) by 2020, and will set a new target of at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030.\n\nThis is enough to meet the annual power needs of around 350,000 households in Singapore, and according to The Straits Times, is about 4 per cent of Singapore\u2019s total electricity demand today. It will require an eight times increase in solar adoption from today\u2019s capacity.\n\nRead also: CapitaLand is putting over 20,000 solar panels on 6 of its buildings \u2013 that\u2019s enough power for 2,300 HDB flats a year\n\nTo this end, Singapore will deploy and maximise solar panels over available spaces, including rooftops, reservoirs and offshore spaces. \u201cBesides increasing our clean energy supply, solar will improve energy security by tapping on alternative energy sources,\u201d EMA said.\n\nIn addition, Singapore has set an energy storage deployment target of 200 MW beyond 2025. To achieve this, the authority will work with the industry and agencies to support a large-scale, nationwide deployment of Energy Storage Systems (ESS).\n\nAs solar energy can be affected by weather conditions, energy storage helps to address solar intermittency and enhance grid resilience by managing mismatches between electricity supply and demand, EMA said.\n\nRegional power grids and low-carbon alternatives\n\nThe third switch is the use of regional power grids, which EMA says can be explored for cost-competitive energy via bilateral cooperation or regional initiatives.\n\nLastly, emerging low-carbon alternatives \u2013 such as carbon capture, utilisation or storage technologies and hydrogen \u2013 will also be studied to see how they can help reduce Singapore\u2019s carbon footprint.\n\nRead also: PUB is building one of the world\u2019s largest floating solar panel systems that could generate enough power for 13,500 HDB flats every year\n\nChan also said that \u201cthe holy grail for everyone today is nuclear fusion, not nuclear fission\u201d, but added that it will take \u201cmany more years to mature fusion technology before it can be commercialised\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut we will never give up the search for alternative energy sources to complement the three Switches that we already have,\u201d he said.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Singapore has big plans for clean energy, and the good ol' sun is its best resource..
