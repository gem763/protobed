On Sunday the president of Brazil\u2019s supreme court overruled a court decision that had endorsed Crivella\u2019s move.\n\nThe populist bishop and the Apprentice host: meet Brazil's new megacity mayors Read more\n\nFolha de S.Paulo\u2019s mission was to \u201cthrow light on censorship threats\u201d, its editor, S\u00e9rgio D\u00e1vila, told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cIt is an attack on freedom of expression,\u201d said Mariana Zahar, the vice-president of the National Union of Book Publishers, which organised the book fair. \u201cWe will fight this to the end.\u201d\n\nThe controversy began on Thursday when Crivella ordered the biennial to wrap copies of the graphic novel in black plastic. \u201cWhat we did was defend the family,\u201d Crivella said in a video he tweeted on Friday after ordering city hall inspectors to seize copies of the book \u2013 which had apparently sold out by that point anyway.\n\n\u201cIt is a backwards decision \u2026 it is ignorant censorship,\u201d said Marcelo Chalr\u00e9o, the president of the commission of social rights at Rio\u2019s bar association, which has also attacked the legality of Crivella\u2019s move.\n\nFelipe Neto, a YouTube celebrity with 34 million followers, bought 14,000 copies of books with LGBT themes at the book fair and gave them out for free, wrapped in black plastic with the warning: \u201cBook inappropriate for backward \u2026 and prejudiced people.\u201d Demonstrators marched through the event, wrapped in rainbow colours and waving placards and books, while gay couples kissed in protest.\n\nNeto linked Crivella\u2019s move to the government of Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly made homophobic comments. Bolsonaro watched an independence day military parade on Saturday with Crivella\u2019s uncle, the evangelical bishop Edir Macedo, the founder of the powerful Universal Church of the Kingdom of God.\n\n\u201cAlthough we [are] going through the most frightening government in terms of repression since the dictatorship, this time we have a united and engaged people who will not permit that censorship, the imposition of others\u2019 moral values,\u201d Neto told the Guardian.", "description": "Folha de S.Paulo aims dig at evangelical Rio mayor after he tried to ban a Marvel comic", "authors": ["Dom Phillips"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1f27d5efb186387d637b727a81815c1a03472b/0_17_1394_836/master/1394.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=828b7661cbf16cfe7b2dfadebe84a7d8", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
