Spurs were a powerhouse in the sixties: they won the double in 1961 \u2013 with Hollowbread, primarily the club\u2019s reserve goalkeeper, making one appearance that season \u2013 as well as the FA Cup again in 1962 and 1967 and the Uefa Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1963. White Hart Lane was demolished in recent years to make way for a new multi-million pound stadium, but this ethereal image captures the old ground in its pomp. The packed \u201cshelf side\u201d, comprising twin layers of terracing, housed close to 20,000 Spurs fans and produced an intimidating wall of noise. This historical photograph is one of the most recognisable frames by the renowned sports photographer Gerry Cranham.\n\nPhotograph: Gerry Cranham/Offside\n\nWords: Jonny Weeks\n\nBuy your exclusive print here\n\nPrice\n\n\u00a355 including free delivery (30x40cm print size).\n\nPrints\n\nPhotographs are presented on museum-grade, fine-art paper stocks, with archival standards guaranteeing quality for 100-plus years.
