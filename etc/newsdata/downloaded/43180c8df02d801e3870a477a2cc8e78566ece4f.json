The list includes U.K. fashion retailer New Look and Rallye SA, parent of French supermarket chain Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA. More are set to follow as Europe\u2019s economy slows and a growing number of companies come under stress.\n\nThe decision to trigger payouts on Thomas Cook CDS lies with a panel of traders called the Determinations Committee. The group was set to meet on Monday to debate whether last week\u2019s Chapter 15 U.S. bankruptcy filing was sufficient for payment. Now, it is also likely to be asked to assess Thomas Cook\u2019s liquidation.\n\nCDS are a popular way for hedge funds to bet on companies facing difficulties with their balance sheets. They don\u2019t always pay out in the event of default, however.\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s rescue could have rendered CDS on the debt worthless and investors including Sona Asset Management had threatened to block it. Holders of CDS were concerned about a technicality related to plans to convert Thomas Cook debt into shares, leaving the CDS with nothing to insure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a relief for the hedge funds that Thomas Cook has filed and they haven\u2019t had to push the company into administration,\u201d said Marc Pierron, a senior credit analyst at Spread Research in Lyon.\n\nIf rescue talks hadn\u2019t collapsed over the weekend and the hedge funds had undermined them to ensure a payout, it would have added to criticism of the CDS market.\n\nRead more: Thomas Cook\u2019s Rescue Tests Reputation of Default Protection\n\nRegulators are already eyeing the derivatives market for so-called manufactured credit events, when funds entice companies to miss bond payments they could otherwise make.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katie Linsell in London at klinsell@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Vivianne Rodrigues at vrodrigues3@bloomberg.net, Chris Vellacott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Thomas Cook Group Plc\u2019s collapse may prove lucrative for some.Investors holding credit insurance on the U.K. travel agent\u2019s debt are set for a long-awaited payday and may cash in on as much as $250 million after the company filed for liquidation early Monday.Thomas Cook will be the latest", "authors": ["Katie Linsell"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jErKKS8KMf76pDPZmn2n_A--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/64c022cead890288da5d5ed36067d0b0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
