These ghosts will appear with minimal effort and maximum impact.\n\nHere's what you'll need:\n\nScissors\n\n\n\nCheesecloth (available at most grocery or hardware stores)\n\n\n\n3 bottles\n\n\n\n3 balloons\n\n\n\nBowl\n\n\n\nWhite glue\n\n\n\nBlack card stock\n\n\n\nString\n\n\n\n1 bead\n\n\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\nCut the cheesecloth into squares. You'll want to layer the squares for texture, so use at least 3 layers.\n\nSet out 1 taller bottle for the head, and 2 smaller bottles for the arms.\n\nBlow up 3 small balloons that will be used to shape the head and the arms, and place them on top of the bottles.\n\nPour a good amount of glue into a bowl.\n\nNow it's time to shape the ghost. Dip the cheesecloth in the glue, and make sure it's evenly coated. Squish through the glue.\n\nLay the cheesecloth over the balloons, and stretch the cloth to avoid clumps.\n\nLet the ghost dry overnight.\n\nYour ghost is ready for the final steps. Remove the balloons by popping them and gently peeling them away.\n\nCut out circles for the eyes and the mouth with black card stock, and glue them on the face of the ghost.\n\nCut a small hole on top of the head using your scissors.\n\nFeed the string through the hole, and add a bead on the inside to keep it secure. Pull the string through.\n\nYou now have a spooktacular ghost for your Halloween decorations!\u200b", "description": "Halloween phantoms you can float together or alone in any size you want to materialize.", "authors": ["Cbc Life"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.4867379.1539808913!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/beautyshot-jpg.JPG", "published_at": "2018-10-17"}
