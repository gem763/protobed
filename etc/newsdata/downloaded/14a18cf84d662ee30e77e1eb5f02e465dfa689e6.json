Volker, the State Department\u2019s former special envoy for Ukraine, come from a series of early September exchanges. They appear to show a dispute among U.S. diplomats over whether the president was trying to use security aid or a White House meeting with the country\u2019s new leader as leverage to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on a leading political rival \u2014 a charge at the heart of the impeachment investigation.\n\nOne message, written by William B. Taylor Jr., the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, suggested that Trump was holding back the package of military aid to Ukraine as a bargaining chip to influence the country\u2019s president to do his political bidding.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote on Sept. 9 to Volker and Gordon D. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.\n\nSondland replied that he believed he had \u201cidentified the best path forward\u201d for unfreezing the assistance. But he also took issue that there is any sort of direct agreement, writing in response, \u201cThe President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d He then suggested the conversation move to phone rather than text.\n\nThat exchange and others emerged as congressional investigators met privately for more than nine hours on Capitol Hill with Volker, who is the first witness in their growing impeachment inquiry into whether Trump tried to bend American policy for his own political benefit by pressuring President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats.\n\nWhile the president has openly admitted that he wanted Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter Biden, a crucial question has been whether Trump tried to use the security aid or a meeting at the White House as leverage. The money was delayed until the Trump administration released it last month amid a bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.\n\nIn his text, Sondland added, \u201cThe President is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelenskiy promised during his campaign.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear what led Taylor to conclude that Trump was withholding aid as leverage over Ukraine. When the texts were sent, news reports about the delay in releasing the aid, and about attempts by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and other Democrats, had already prompted public speculation that Trump was engaging in a quid pro quo.\n\nBut his concerns persisted. Roughly a week earlier, on Sept. 1, Taylor had asked Sondland, \u201cAre we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\u201d\n\nSondland replied simply, \u201cCall me.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Taylor described a \u201cnightmare\u201d situation in which the Ukrainians announced they would conduct the investigations Trump wanted and still not receive the security assistance. \u201cThe Russians love it,\u201d he wrote of that potential outcome. \u201c(And I quit.)\u201d\n\nTaylor could not be reached for comment Thursday. The texts thrust him into the center of the blossoming controversy, and he is now almost certain to be called to testify by lawmakers.\n\nDemocrats leading the investigation said the messages \u201creflect serious concerns raised by a State Department official about the detrimental effects of withholding critical military assistance from Ukraine, and the importance of setting up a meeting between President Trump and the Ukrainian president without further delay.\u201d\n\nRepublicans demanded a full transcript of Volker\u2019s interview be released. \u201cThe facts we learned today undercut the salacious narrative that Adam Schiff is using to sell his impeachment ambitions,\u201d wrote Reps. Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes, the top Republicans on the Oversight and Reform and Intelligence committees, referring to the chairman of the intelligence panel.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- A top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine repeatedly raised concerns with colleagues about the White House's decision to withhold $391 million in security aid from Ukraine, describing it as a \"crazy\" plan to withhold security assistance \"for help with a political campaign,\"", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Julian E.
