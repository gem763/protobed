In addition to his own travel savvy, he reportedly used proxies, private browsers and other digital methods to find the lowest possible fares for his clients.\n\n\u201cThe rest of his methods are trade secrets,\u201d Wired\u2019s Zoe Mendelson wrote. When explaining those methods, \u201che smiles innocently and shrugs. \u2018We have to get very creative,\u2019 \u201d he told Wired.\n\nOne of those creative methods, federal prosecutors allege, was fraudulently gaming the Delta SkyBonus miles program to reap millions of points and book tickets on behalf of his firm\u2019s clients, who prosecutors say are primarily individuals of Russian and Eastern European descent who were living abroad.\n\n\u201cPodolsky used his knowledge of the travel industry to take advantage of his travel agency clients,\u201d U.S. Attorney Byung J. Pak said in a statement. \u201cThrough his access, he allegedly took advantage of Delta Airlines corporate frequent flyer program, illegally reaping millions of SkyBonus points worth more than $1.75 million dollars.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the 43-year-old owner of Chicago-based Vega International Travel Services was arraigned in Atlanta on charges of wire fraud after being indicted by a grand jury. He pleaded not guilty and will be permitted to await trial at his residence in Chicago, assistant U.S. attorney John S. Ghose said.\n\n\n\nDelta Air Lines jets are parked at John F.

(Mark Lennihan)\n\nDelta\u2019s SkyBonus program allows businesses to collect points when their employees travel with the airline that can be spent on flights and other airline perks. But there is an important caveat: The traveler must be an employee of the company to be eligible. Prosecutors say Podolsky set up a SkyBonus account through a fertility center owned by a family member of Vega International Travel\u2019s president, then booked tickets for his clients using that account and fraudulently passed them off as employees of the fertility company.\n\nPodolsky allegedly perpetrated the fraud between March 2014 and April 2015 and accrued and redeemed more than 42 million SkyBonus points, prosecutors say.\n\nIn a statement, Podolsky\u2019s lawyers denied that his actions were fraudulent or that Delta had suffered financial losses.\n\n\u201cGennady Podolsky is a well-respected and highly-skilled travel adviser who has served a loyal clientele for many years,\u201d said Seth Kirschenbaum and Nicholas Lotito of Davis, Zipperman, Kirschenbaum & Lotito.\n\n\u201cMr. Podolsky\u2019s conduct was not fraudulent,\u201d they said. \u201cIndeed, while the government says Delta is a victim, the evidence at trial will show Delta actually netted millions of dollars of profits from its relationship with Mr. Podolsky. The suggestion that Mr. Podolsky\u2019s conduct somehow disadvantaged his clients is equally unfounded.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Delta Air Lines said, \u201cWe\u2019re happy to see any kind of fraud indicted and continue to work with the FBI and the District Attorney\u2019s office to make sure this case is prosecuted to its fullest extent.\u201d\n\nA representative for Vega International Travel did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nPodolsky hails from Kiev, Ukraine, and holds dual Ukrainian and U.S. citizenship. He arrived in the United States at age 17 to attended Swarthmore College and opened his first travel agency a year later in 1993, Wired reported.\n\nRead more:\n\nCharlie Cole, photographer who captured the Tiananmen \u2018Tank Man,\u2019 has died\n\nAll crew members were asleep when deadly California boat fire erupted, government report says\n\nA fortune teller scammed a woman out of $1.6 million.
