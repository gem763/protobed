The executive action announced yesterday requiring immigrants to prove they can purchase health insurance or pay for their own health care just like Americans is a common-sense requirement that will protect both immigrants and Americans,\" said the group's executive director, Tim Chapman, in a statement.\n\n\"As we welcome people to our country, it\u2019s important they contribute to our nation, not deplete our resources,\" he added.\n\nThe White House said the proclamation will take effect Nov. 3.\n\nThis is the latest effort by the Trump administration to lessen immigration. It has sought to limit migrants entering the country both legally and illegally.\n\nThe administration has similarly attempted to tie immigration to welfare through its \"public charge\" rule, which would make a person's ability to receive a green card dependent on whether they used certain public assistance programs.
