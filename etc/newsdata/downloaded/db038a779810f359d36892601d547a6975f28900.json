He\u2019s never even eaten a deer; he\u2019s never been in a deer woods and if he has, he\u2019s either lying or hopelessly ignorant. I want regulations based on sound science to keep these precious wildlife resources in the asset column, attracted to the hunting families in Michigan, to become a destination state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the ultimate conservationist and I killed two mature bucks on my property last year with my bow and arrow, neither of them anywhere near bait. I don\u2019t need to bait. Nobody needs to bait. I don\u2019t need an 850 horsepower hellcat either but I\u2019m an American and I own that property,\u201d added Mr. Nugent, according to the outlet. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to hunt over bait, it\u2019s pretty simple. Don\u2019t. We choose. It\u2019s a choice.\u201d\n\nMr. Nugent, 70, was born in Redford, a suburb of Detroit, but moved to Texas more than a decade ago, even buying property nearby then-President George W. Bush\u2019s ranch in Crawford. Dubbed the \u201cMotor City Madman,\u201d Mr. Nugent previously wrote columns for The Washington Times.\n\nThe recently enacted ban on baiting game is not state-wide: it applies throughout Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula and in parts of the Upper Peninsula where a high number of deer have become infected in recent years with a certain, contagious neurological disease known as chronic wasting disease.\n\nThe bill backed by Mr. Nugent, HB 4687, is not likely to be considered before bow hunting season begins next month, the Detroit Free Press reported. Firearm hunting season starts Nov. 15.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
