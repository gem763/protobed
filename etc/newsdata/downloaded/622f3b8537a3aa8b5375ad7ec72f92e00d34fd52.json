Both JetBlue's Core and Even More Space seats feature a custom-made, E-leather dress cover designed by Acumen and manufactured by upholstery specialists Sabeti Wain Aerospace.\n\nThe redesigned snack station, which JetBlue calls The Pantry. Acumen said it has a more residential design\n\nJetBlue has ordered 85 A321neos. They will eventually serve two new international routes for JetBlue - New York JFK to Guayaquil, Ecuador, and New York JFK to Georgetown, Guyana\n\nThe Core dress cover has been embellished with the airline's distinctive blue branding, while the Even More Space seats feature a bold orange halo, highlighting the increase in seat pitch (at least 35 inches).\n\nThe seats also include adjustable padded headrests as standard, 'ensuring all customers have the required head and neck support to enjoy the in-flight experience'.\n\nThe new 'backpack' stowage system, which is a feature throughout the cabin, 'improves functionality'.\n\nAcumen said: 'Featuring more pockets and a woven elastic grid that can be configured to suit individual needs, the design has improved the functionality of a part of the seat which is often ignored. Customers are now able to securely store, organise and charge multiple personal items \u2013 such as phones, tablets, headphones and passports \u2013 and easily access them when needed.'\n\nThe galley area, meanwhile, has been 'de-industrialised'.\n\nThe 'bold JetBlue identity' has been integrated into 'a strong architectural signature at the door' and customised front row partition.\n\nAcumen said: 'Alongside its privacy benefits, the partition also offers fold-down tables and new stowage options for crew iPads, as well as a subtle window to facilitate a direct view of the cabin for crew seated in the attendant seats.'\n\nThe lavatories have been spruced up too and 'redesigned to reflect the modern urban residential feel of the aircraft'.\n\nThe A321neos feature brand new 10-inch entertainment screens and free on-board Wi-Fi is standard\n\nThe galley area has been 'de-industrialised'.

We were able to give customers more choice in how they use their increased space. We worked JetBlue's brand image into every part of the cabin, and the new design greatly improves the narrow-body flying experience, offering JetBlue customers an incredible leap forward, unmatched by its US rivals.'\n\nAndrew Litavis, product development manager at JetBlue, said: 'It is not every day two innovative powerhouses of the industry come together to create something new, but that is exactly what has happened here. Built with our crew members and our customers in mind, the new A321 cabin is unlike any other single-aisle aircraft interior flying today \u2013 and will redefine expectations for economy travellers taking to the skies.'\n\nJetBlue has ordered 85 A321neos.
