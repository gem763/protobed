I have those weird preset ideas that I should get married and have a big white dress but it's not the be all and end all. We have our family, we're together, we're practically married in our opinion.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"That piece of paper for us isn't something we feel we need right now.\"\n\nStacey, 30, had raised her boys as a single parent before meeting Joe, who is also dad to Harry, 11, and previously said it's no better or worse without the father there.\n\nShe said: \"Neither have been better, or worse, or easier, or harder than another.\n\n(Image: staceysolomon/Instagram)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"With Zachary, my circumstances were completely different. I was in college, I wasn't with his dad and things were really tough, but also really brilliant.\"\n\nStacey said her circumstances were different again when she has Leighton, and that it's never been the same with any of her children.\n\nThroughout her pregnancy with baby Rex and since welcoming him, Stacey has been praised by fans for her honest posts about pregnancy and motherhood.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nStacey even took Rex on Loose Women for his TV debut, and he left viewers distracted with his cuteness.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
