Now It Sputters.\u201d\n\nIn the review, Wells criticises everything from the wait time to the lack of smiles from staff, but it is the food that he finds the most fault with.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cSome things are the same as ever,\u201d Wells wrote. \u201cThe shrimp cocktail has always tasted like cold latex dipped in ketchup and horseradish. The steak sauce has always tasted like the same ketchup and horseradish fortified with corn syrup.\u201d\n\nThe reviewer then moves on to his main dish, sole, which he ordered despite dining at a steakhouse.\n\n\u201cThe sole - yes, I\u2019m the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger - was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe review, which ends with the conclusion that \u201cnobody\u201d goes to the restaurant, led David Berson, the general manager and the grandson of the restaurant\u2019s founders, to defend the steakhouse.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times has reviewed Peter Luger numerous times over the years,\u201d Berson told Eater. \u201cAt times we\u2019ve gotten four stars, other times less. While the reviewers and their whims have changed, Lugers has always focused on doing one thing exceptionally well - serving the highest quality of steak - with a member of our family buying every piece of USDA Prime beef individually, just as we have done for decades.\u201d\n\nBerson also said Luger knows \u201cwho we are and have always been,\u201d which he claims is \u201cthe best steak you can eat. Not the latest kale salad\u201d.\n\nHe concluded his response thanking the restaurant\u2019s loyal customers, who continue to send \u201cemails of encouragement\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Wait till they find out what else I ordered,\u201d the reviewer captioned a photo of broccoli.\n\nIn a more serious response, he shared a picture of the sole in question and said it was \u201cvery attractively cooked\u201d and \u201chas its fans\u201d.\n\nAlternatively, there were some people who sided with Wells, and agreed that the restaurant had lost its touch.\n\nWhether it should or not, the review has impacted the public perception of Peter Luger and thrust the restaurant into the spotlight.\n\nAs one of the most well-known food reviewers, Wells\u2019 words are capable of capturing the notice of the public and changing the minds of hungry diners looking for their next meal. It is also the first link that appears when you Google the name of the steakhouse.\n\nHowever, whether it will impact the restaurant's success in the future, or whether the review will eventually be forgotten as the past reviews of the restaurant have been, is unknown.\n\nAs pointed out by Berson, the restaurant continues to receive support from its fans.", "description": "A New York Times food reviewer gave an iconic steakhouse a scathing zero-star review - but the owner has now hit back.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/30/13/istock-877940748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
