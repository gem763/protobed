In an increasingly dysfunctional American political landscape, now melting down into a zero-sum game over impeachment, rational discussion of perhaps the most imperative question of U.S. global policy has become virtually impossible.\n\nOne of the telltale symptoms is that normal words don\u2019t mean anything anymore. For example, take \u201callies,\u201d as in the accusation that President Trump has benefited Moscow by \u201cbetraying our Kurdish allies\u201d in Syria or balking on arming \u201cour ally Ukraine.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the U.S. has an alliance treaty with neither Kurds nor Ukraine. Conversely, Turkey actually is America\u2019s NATO ally. As few Americans are aware, we just picked up a new treaty ally under the improbable moniker of \u201cNorth Macedonia.\u201d NATO expansion to counter \u201cthe Russian threat\u201d marches on.\n\nOr take \u201crule of law.\u201d Salon\u2019s Chauncey DeVega writes that Mr. Trump has \u201cco-opted \u2026 the rule of law through the Department of Justice as well as United States foreign policy.\u201d How? By circumventing the career U.S. Foreign Service and other bureaucracies in a bid to investigate the foreign, including Ukrainian, role in FISA-gate.\n\nCan these people read? The Constitution (Article 2, Section 1, Clause 1) says: \u201cThe executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\u201d The president. Not the Foreign Service, not the intelligence \u201ccommunity,\u201d not the FBI or other \u201cinferior Officers\u201d (Section 2), whose job it is to implement the president\u2019s policies, not the other way around.\n\nImpeachment-fixated Democrats and their Never-Trump GOP fellow-travelers think they have a smoking gun with current Charge d\u2019Affaires in Kyiv William Taylor\u2019s claim that there was indeed a quid pro quo between providing Ukraine with arms (for which the U.S. has no obligation) and America\u2019s top law enforcement officer (i.e. the president) asking Ukraine to investigate criminal activity. But do they?\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s enemies keep hyping Hunter Biden\u2019s profiteering as the object of his attention while downplaying the real issue: What was Ukraine\u2019s role in the criminal conspiracy inside the U.S. government to block Mr. Trump in 2016 (it failed) or to neuter and remove him if he happened to win (still ongoing)?\n\nAs anyone who\u2019s been paying attention knows, along with British agencies the previous Ukrainian government under Petro Poroshenko, current President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s predecessor, was integral to activities to that end by John Brennan, James Clapper, Andrew McCabe, James B. Comey, Peter Strzok, Susan Rice, Samantha Power, Victoria Nuland and many others, probably including former President Barack Obama himself, plus some Republican Never-Trumpers and D.C. think tanks.\n\nEven now, the \u201cResistance\u201d inside the administration protects this anti-constitutional cabal, which is why Mr. Trump, despite his legal authority, is pathetically reduced to what he can accomplish personally or through private intermediaries. Will the long-awaited Department of Justice Inspector General\u2019s report and the much ballyhooed Durham investigation (now reportedly after Brennan and Clapper) amount to much? I\u2019m skeptical.\n\nMeanwhile, federal prosecutors ostensibly under Mr. Trump\u2019s authority are Johnny-on-the-spot in hammering Rudolph W. Giuliani and his informants seeking to uncover the conspiracy. The message from the Deep State to those seeking to help their nominal boss is clear: \u201cBack off, or end up like Paul Manafort.\u201d\n\nAs Matt Taibbi comments (\u201cWe\u2019re in a permanent coup\u201c): \u201cI don\u2019t believe most Americans have thought through what a successful campaign to oust Donald Trump would look like. \u2026 The real problem would be the precedent of a de facto intelligence community veto over elections, using the lunatic spookworld brand of politics that has dominated the last three years of anti-Trump agitation.\u201d\n\nIf the Deep State plotters finally harpoon their Great Orange Whale, it will mark the end of even a pretense of a constitutional order in this country.\n\nAt this point, the odds are against Mr. Trump. His critics still hold their ace card: Russia. Coup-meister Clapper agrees with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, that all roads lead to Putin. As Anne Gearan of The Washington Post asks, what\u2019s Mr. Trump\u2019s common denominator in Syria and Ukraine? To help Russia of course!\n\nNot just Mr. Trump but anyone who puts American interests before those of the permanent warfare state can count on being targeted as a Kremlin stooge: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Jill Stein, Sen. Rand Paul, former Rep. Ron Paul and Rep. Tom Massie are among the brave few willing to face the smears.\n\nAs the impeachment witch hunt unfolds, the real treachery rotting our public life remains hidden. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky faces his own Deep State thwarting both efforts to bring peace to the Donbas and to get the truth to Washington \u2014 as if anyone here really cared.\n\nIn such a climate, Russia isn\u2019t a foreign policy issue; it\u2019s Rorschach blot test for treason. Things have no place to go but down.\n\n\u2981 James George Jatras is a former U.S. diplomat and former foreign policy adviser to the Senate Republican leadership.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
