You can\u2019t run a free society if you have to hate everybody you disagree with.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, other prominent politicians who spoke at his funeral were former President Barack Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cElijah wrote his funeral program and decided who he wanted to do what,\u201d Bishop Walter Scott Thomas, the pastor, said after Ms. Warren and Representative Marcia Fudge, Democrat of Ohio, read from the Bible. \u201cSome of you may be wondering why you are not doing anything, so I wanted to give you clarity.\u201d\n\nThe funeral was held at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, where Mr. Cummings could usually be seen seated in the front row on Sundays. The church seats 4,000 people, but was expected to draw far more for the funeral on Friday.\n\n\u201cI love this man,\u201d Mr. Clinton said, gesturing toward the coffin. \u201cI loved every minute I ever spent with him, every conversation I ever had with him. I loved his booming voice. But we should hear him now at the quiet times of night, when we get worried, and we get discouraged, and we don\u2019t know if we can believe anymore.\u201d\n\nAgain referring to the story of the prophet Elijah, Mr. Clinton said Americans should remember Mr. Cummings as \u201ca still, small voice that keeps us going, keeps us grateful, keeps us happy and keeps us moving.\u201d", "description": "Comparing the congressman to a biblical prophet, the former secretary of state said Elijah Cummings \u201cstood against the corrupt leadership of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.\u201d", "authors": ["Liam Stack"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/multimedia/25xp-clintonSUB/25xp-clintonSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
