He actually claims that imposing a wealth tax and confiscating private capital can lead to more growth.\n\nThere are two problems with the arguments from these opponents. First, they\u2019re based on a premise that the American economy is doing just fine and we shouldn\u2019t mess with success. [\u2026] Second, [\u2026] it\u2019s also plausible that a wealth tax would accelerate economic growth. [\u2026] A large portion of society\u2019s resources are held by a tiny slice of people, who aren\u2019t using the resources very efficiently. [\u2026] Sure, it\u2019s theoretically possible that some entrepreneurs and investors might work less hard\u2026 But it\u2019s more likely that any such effect would be small \u2014 and more than outweighed by the return that the economy would get on the programs that a wealth tax would finance, like education, scientific research, infrastructure and more.\n\nWow. It\u2019s rare to see so much inaccuracy in so few words.\n\nLet\u2019s review his arguments.\n\nHis first claim is utter nonsense. I\u2019ve been following the debate over the wealth tax for years, and I\u2019ve never run across a critic who argued that the wealth tax is a bad idea because the economy is \u201cdoing just fine.\u201d\n\nInstead, critics invariably explain that the tax is a bad idea because it would exacerbate the tax code\u2019s bias against saving and investment and thus have a negative effect on jobs, wages, productivity, and competitiveness.\n\nAnd those arguments are true and relevant whether the economy is booming, in a recession, or somewhere in between.\n\nHis second claim is equally absurd. He wants readers to believe that government spending is good for growth and that those benefits will more than offset the economic harm from the punitive tax.\n\nTo be fair, at least this is not a make-believe argument. Left-leaning bureaucracies such as the International Monetary Fund and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have been pushing this idea in recent years. They use phrases such as \u201cresource mobilization\u201d and \u201cfinancing for development\u201d to argue that higher taxes will lead to more growth because governments somehow will use money wisely.\n\nNeedless to say, that\u2019s a preposterous, anti-empirical assertion. Especially when dealing with a tax that would do lots of damage on a per-dollar-collected basis.\n\nInterestingly, a news report in the New York Times had a much more rational assessment, largely focusing on the degree of damage such a tax would cause.\n\nProgressive Democrats are advocating the most drastic shift in tax policy in over a century as they look to redistribute wealth\u2026with new taxes that could fundamentally reshape the United States economy. \u2026Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont have proposed wealth taxes that would shrink the fortunes of the richest Americans. Their plans envision an enormous transfer of money from the wealthy\u2026 the idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes. \u2026At a conference sponsored by the Brookings Institution in September, N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist, \u2026offered a searing critique, arguing that a wealth tax would skew incentives that could alter when the superrich make investments, how they give to charity and even potentially spur a wave of divorces for tax purposes. He also noted that billionaires, with their legions of lawyers and accountants, have proven to be experts at gaming the system to avoid even the most onerous taxes. \u2026\u201cOn the one hand it\u2019s a bad policy, and then the other thing is it\u2019s a feckless policy,\u201d Mr. Mankiw said. Left-leaning economists have expressed their own doubts about a wealth tax. Earlier this year, Lawrence Summers, who was President Bill Clinton\u2019s Treasury secretary, warned\u2026that wealth taxes would sap innovation by putting new burdens on entrepreneurial businesses while they are starting up. In their view, a country with more millionaires is a sign of economic vibrancy.\n\nThis is an example of good reporting. It cited supporters and opponents and fairly represented their arguments.\n\nReaders learn that the real debate is over the magnitude of economic harm.\n\nSpeaking of which, a Bloomberg column explains how much money might get siphoned from the private economy if a wealth tax is imposed.\n\nBillionaires such as Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett could have collectively lost hundreds of billions of dollars in net worth over decades if presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s wealth tax plan had been in effect \u2014 and they had done nothing to avoid it. That\u2019s according to calculations in a new paper by two French economists, who helped her devise the proposed tax on the wealthiest Americans. The top 15 richest Americans would have seen their net worth decline by more than half to $433.9 billion had Warren\u2019s plan been in place since 1982, according to the paper by University of California, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. \u2026The calculations underscore how a wealth tax of just a few percentage points might erode fortunes over time.\n\nHere\u2019s the chart that accompanied the article.\n\nWhat matters to the economy, though, is not the amount of wealth owned by individual entrepreneurs.\n\nInstead, it\u2019s the amount of saving and investment (i.e., the stock of capital) in the economy.\n\nA wealth tax is bad news because it diverts capital from the private sector and transfers it to Washington where politicians will squander the funds (notwithstanding David Leonhardt\u2019s fanciful hopes).\n\nSo I decided to edit the Bloomberg chart so that is gives us an idea of how the economy will be impacted.\n\nThe bottom line is that wealth taxation would be very harmful to America\u2019s economy.\n\nP.S. Several years ago, bureaucrats at the IMF tried to argue that a wealth tax wouldn\u2019t damage growth if two impossible conditions were satisfied: 1) It was a total surprise, and 2) It was only imposed one time.", "description": "I\u00a0sometimes mock the\u00a0New York Times for dodgy and inaccurate writing .10/04/2019 8:29:13AM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
