Modernised and efficient hospitals contain advanced technologies that require a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nEvery proposed innovation or modification calls for a proper assessment of the yields, profitability and risks.\n\nGlobally, the hospital landscape is transforming, as the provision of affordable, accessible, long-term high quality care is increasingly becoming a priority.\n\nRead: The business of health: How the challenges could scupper the NHI\n\nHospitals internationally are progressively becoming \u201cnormal\u201d businesses, with all the related operating risks.\n\nCare providers must balance costs and health yields, and the price-performance ratio of healthcare properties is an important strategic measurement.\n\nQuestions to be considered include whether proposed changes lead to better care; if the investments are viable; and whether the changes can be performed in a way that does not compromise continuity and patient safety.\n\nThe trick is to make the right changes and to implement these well, which calls for in-depth knowledge and experience of property and technology at all levels.\n\nThere are several ways this can be done: . A Virtual Design and Construction approach to repurposing existing healthcare facilities or building new ones allows everyone involved in a project to \u201csee\u201d the final product before ground is broken. By virtually building the project, all stakeholders achieve a better understanding of the design and any bottlenecks become clear quickly.\n\n. The Schillenmethode used in the Netherlands is a functional zoning model that revolutionises how hospitals are planned, built and run, and patients are treated. It allows for integrated, modular and flexible planning that makes smart patient-centric care and staff-oriented facilities possible through quick modular construction. It includes a \u201chot floor\u201d, which provides advanced monitoring technologies for the sickest patients, including imaging facilities and operating theatres. The \u201chotel\u201d is the hospital\u2019s accommodation zone, linked digitally to medical services. The \u201coffice\u201d houses administration, management and day clinics, while the \u201cfactory\u201d includes support functions such as laundries and kitchens. . Private-public partnerships are vital to create meaningful solutions. While the department of health has a wealth of expertise, with its political head a qualified doctor, achieving healthcare infrastructure that meets the needs and requirements of the NHI is likely to be more efficient if professionals experienced in healthcare development are afforded the opportunity to contribute. . Once public hospitals have been upgraded or built to Infrastructure Unit Support Systems standards that will ensure the success of the NHI, proactive management is essential to maintain high levels of service delivery.\n\nEffective asset management helps optimise efficiency by offering insight into costs, yields, care performance and the feasibility of any further strategies or interventions.\n\n\n\nThis can be achieved with building information modelling that creates a dynamic and digital 3-D model of the building \u2013 or digital twin \u2013 which helps to identify and prevent structural and process defects.\n\nThis approach results in a proven reduction of the contingency by 25% to 50%.\n\nHealthcare is a right entrenched in the Constitution.\n\nBut this right can only be delivered effectively through the goals of the NHI if healthcare environments are designed and adapted or built for the needs of the communities they serve.\n\nCassim is a senior healthcare architect at Royal HaskoningDHV", "description": "The objectives of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill have considerable merit.
