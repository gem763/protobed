The DUP have 10 votes. The British parliament is due to meet on Saturday in an extraordinary session - the first such meeting since the 1982 Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands.\n\nSterling slid as much as 0.6% to $1.2748, and also declined 0.5% versus the euro to as low as 86.81 pence, before steadying and recouping some of those losses.\n\nEU SUMMIT\n\nOn the eve of the summit, officials said that almost all of the differences between the two sides had been resolved after marathon talks in Brussels.\n\nBut any deal must be ratified by the British parliament which has defeated similar deals struck by Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, three times.\n\nJohnson won the top job by pledging to renegotiate May's failed agreement, though he is largely recasting that deal with changes to the protocol on how to treat the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe conundrum was how to prevent the frontier becoming a backdoor into the EU's single market without erecting controls which could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that ended decades of conflict in the province.\n\nBut unionists such as the DUP - named due to their loyalty to the union of Northern Ireland and Britain - are worried that the EU's proposals would divide the United Kingdom and trap Northern Ireland in the bloc's orbit for years to come.\n\nGermany's Europe Minister Michael Roth said he was hopeful that the Brexit talks would yield a result, adding that the chances for reaching an orderly Brexit were higher than one or two weeks ago.\n\n\"From what I have heard on the Brexit talks, I am encouraged to say this could lead to something,\" Roth told public broadcaster BR on Thursday.", "description": "Northern Ireland's DUP says it cannot support Brexit deal as it stands", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9G0DQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
