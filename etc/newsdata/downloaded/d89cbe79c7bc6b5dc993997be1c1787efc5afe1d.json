When I took the first call this morning, I thought the person was confused and they imagined the whale sighting,\u201d he said.\n\nThe PLA sent a patrol boat to go and look, with the same crew that found Hessy\u2019s body, who quickly confirmed it was a dead whale. The crew managed to get a line around the whale and gently towed it to a PLA site, where the animal was lifted from the water and taken to the Zoological Society of London for a postmortem analysis, Garside said.\n\nHumpback whale found dead in Thames was hit by a ship Read more\n\nRob Deaville of ZSL\u2019s cetacean strandings investigation programme said: \u201cExperts are hoping to access the whale to perform an examination over the next few days, but there is no reason to assume the two recent whale strandings in the Thames over the past week are in any way linked.\u201d\n\nHessy was first seen swimming in the Thames 11 days ago. The whale died a few days later.\n\nA detailed postmortem examination found Hessy was an 8.37-metre (27ft) juvenile female that had not eaten recently and was \u201cnutritionally compromised\u201d. While experts found a heavy burden of parasites within the humpback\u2019s intestine, there was no evidence of plastic ingestion.\n\nDeaville said: \u201cThe main finding was a large wound on the underside of the head, associated with a fracture along the length of one of the mandibles (lower jaw). Traces of blood clots around the fractured jaw and haemorrhage around the cut/torn surfaces indicate that the damage occurred before death and it was the team\u2019s opinion that the injuries were most likely a result of ship-strike, and this is considered to be the primary cause of death.\u201d\n\nDeaville could not rule out the possibility that the whale could have been struck before it entered the Thames, and already had its injuries when it was seen swimming in the river.\n\nGarside described the deaths of the two whales as a \u201crandom coincidence\u201d. While it was rare for a whale to end up in the Thames, he said, a handful had been seen over the past decade.\n\nIn 2009, a juvenile male humpback was found dead near the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. Last year, a beluga whale was sighted off Gravesend, more than 1,000 miles (1,600km) from its usual habitat in the Arctic.\n\nGarside said the discovery of the dead whales was \u201cboth poignant and quite moving at the same time\u201d. He said he hoped that recovering the whale\u2019s body and giving it to scientists would lead to an explanation for its death.", "description": "Discovery of whale\u2019s body near Gravesend follows death of young humpback this month", "authors": ["Aamna Mohdin", "Philip Hoare"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcbd591ec1b7f88943c8413c03c9fbbb6e85a43/0_84_738_443/master/738.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a3e8db5e1df1b607ac7c0918cb98960c", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
