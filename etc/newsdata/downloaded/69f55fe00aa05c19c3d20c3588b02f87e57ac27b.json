She was apparently complaining that school children were being assaulted and that there had been a serious fight in the area.

A shootout between both sides ensued, but Booysen did not shoot, Hendricks said.\n\nBooysen's BMW SUV was hit, but he was uninjured.\n\nRead more: 'Dead men tell no tales, your worship' - lawyer for Colin Booysen, bodyguards\n\nPietersen was hit and died later in spite of Abels' first aid kit being pulled out to stop the bleeding while they were waiting for an ambulance.\n\nBooysen and the guards went to the police station to report the shooting and also laid an attempted murder charge against another man present.
