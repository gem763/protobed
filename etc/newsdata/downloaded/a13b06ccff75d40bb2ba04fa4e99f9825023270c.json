Those days are gone for ever. The once-pristine landscape is now dotted with fracking wells and the white patches of land cleared for even more.\n\nQ&A What is the polluters project? Show Hide The Guardian has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis \u2013 some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.\n\nThe investigation has involved more than 20 Guardian journalists working across the world for the past six months. The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute, calculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: \"The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.\" One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from individual responsibilities to power structures \u2013 so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change. Another aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.\n\nThe panoramic view is nonetheless overpowering. Two crystal-blue lakes, whose far shores blend with the horizon, cling to the edge of an arid and wind-buffeted Martian landscape of red sandstone, rugged promontories and wide beaches.\n\n\n\nThe ancient and spectacular rock formations of Neuqu\u00e9n province in Argentina\u2019s Patagonia region are a paleontologist\u2019s dream, rich with dinosaur fossils. But the image quickly fades to the sight and sound of the fracking well that exploded on 14 September and burned continuously for 24 days, spewing hot gas and other elements into the air from nearly two miles below ground.\n\nThe raging fire was finally put out on Monday by a team of experts who flew from Houston with 56 tons of special equipment. \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d Campo Maripe said, \u201cbut these are the consequences of fracking.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 5:03 How fracking is taking its toll on Argentina's indigenous people \u2013 video explainer\n\nFracking accidents happen regularly in Vaca Muerta (Dead Cow in Spanish), one of the world\u2019s largest shale oil and gas reservoirs. In 2018 alone, there were an estimated 934 incidents at 95 wells.\n\nThere have been leaks from drilling sites, and claims from local people of water pollution and increased ill health affecting them and their livestock.\n\nFor Argentina\u2019s leaders there is a bigger picture. They believe the shale reservoir can rescue the country from its ongoing economic crises.\n\n\u201cThis province will transform us into a world power,\u201d the president, Mauricio Macri, said on Tuesday to a crowd of 3,000 people in Neuqu\u00e9n, referring to the nearly 2,000 fracking wells that have been drilled there since the discovery of the deposits was announced in 2011.\n\nTwenty companies own a total of 36 concessions in Vaca Muerta, covering a combined area of about 8,500 sq km (3,300 sq miles).\n\nThe Argentine oil company YPF leads the pack with 23 areas, of which 16 are operational, in partnership with the US firm Chevron.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A gas well by the lake in Vaca Muerta.

Photograph: Uki Goni/The Guardian\n\nThey say the denial of their cultural identity is being used by the Neuqu\u00e9n authorities to refuse the Campo Maripe community legal rights over the Loma Campana plateau, where they say they have grazed their cattle and goats for nearly a century. Pockmarked with more than 500 fracking wells that have sprung up in the past seven years, the plateau is the centre of the fracking boom.\n\nSummer temperatures reach 40C (104F); in winter they dip to -14C. There are no trees, only sparse shrubs that provide subsistence pasture for the cattle and goats of the Campo Maripe community.\n\n\u201cThe oil companies entered our land without our permission,\u201d claims the elder Campo Maripe. The fracking wells took a quick toll on their animals, he says. \u201cWe had goats born without jaws, without mouths.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the community began blocking the access road used by oil company trucks to reach the Loma Campana plateau. \u201cFirst we blocked the road for two weeks, then for 48 days and then again for another 48 days,\u201d says Campo Maripe.\n\nThey occupied fracking towers and even the YPF offices in the capital city of Neuqu\u00e9n. Finally, an agreement was reached for a special committee, consisting of government and Mapuche-appointed experts, to determine the community\u2019s claim on about 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres) in and around Loma Campana.\n\n\u201cWe were able to determine that the Campo Maripe clan has occupied the land continually since at least 1927, when they started paying pasture rights to the national government,\u201d said Jorgelina Villarreal, an anthropologist who formed part of the committee. \u201cWe found government records, even an army map, that show they were the first recorded settlers of Loma Campana.\u201d\n\nBut in 2015, the authorities refused to accept the committee\u2019s findings. The then governor Jorge Sapag said the report failed to prove the community had inhabited the area in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries and therefore their claim to the plateau was invalid. He said: \u201cThe plateau belongs to the province.\u201d\n\nVillareal said: \u201cHis reasoning is ridiculous. Argentina didn\u2019t even exist in the 17th and 18th centuries, but the Mapuches were already here.\u201d The authorities offered the clan the title deed to a mere 700 hectares. The offer was refused.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Campo Maripe community sign in Neuqu\u00e9n province. Photograph: Uki Goni/The Guardian\n\nOil companies say they are trying to work with the indigenous communities but YPF pointed to the 2015 ruling and reiterated: \u201cCampo Maripe has never inhabited the extensive land they are claiming for.\u201d\n\nA spokesman said: \u201cTheir houses and cultural or productive activities are several kilometres away from YPF and Chevron\u2019s operations. Nevertheless, the community still claims they should have rights on the lands where YPF and Chevron operate.\u201d\n\nThe oil companies say their work does not contaminate water sources because it occurs 3,000 metres (9,850ft) below ground, while the water tables are at a depth of only 200 metres.\n\nBut Campo Maripe claims the problem is not seepage from below, but from above. \u201cThey drilled about 400 wells contaminating everything. They dug pits next to the wells where they dumped the waste without any treatment and threw limestone on it to cover it up. We lost our best land.\u201d\n\nAlbino, Mabel and other family members say they have suffered a multitude of health problems since the fracking began.\n\n\u201cOne of our sisters and her husband died of cancer in 2017,\u201d says Mabel. \u201cThe fracking has affected our bones, which become decalcified. I had to have a titanium spine implant; another sister also needs one. Albino had an operation on his arm because of bone loss.\u201d\n\nBoth siblings claim doctors have privately told them the cause is contamination from the wells. \u201cThey are scared to talk,\u201d says Mabel. She says one worried doctor asked her: \u201cAre you recording me?\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, the grandson of another sister was born with his intestines outside his body. They had to operate [on] him to put them in,\u201d says Mabel.\n\nThen there are the permanent headaches, and the smell. On hot, windy days the fields smell like a petrol station.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Vaca Muerta gas well. Photograph: Courtesy of Observatorio Petrolero Sur\n\nThe Guardian asked YPF about the fears of contamination and possible health impacts, including claims of cancer, respiratory ailments and skin lesions. It denied there was a problem.\n\n\u201cAt YPF we are committed to operate with the highest standards. Operational excellence is key and we work permanently to improve and implement solutions that minimise the potential impacts that our activity could generate,\u201d it said. \u201cIn the special case of Loma Campana, the area we develop in partnership with Chevron, no incidents of any kind have been recorded since the beginning of operations in 2013.\u201d\n\nThe arrival of waste disposal contractors has brought a separate set of problems. A Greenpeace team took samples from the open-air waste pits on Loma Campana and released the results to the Mapuche Confederation of Neuqu\u00e9n, which last October opened a lawsuit against the Treater waste disposal plant, alleging that Treater had handled waste for all the fossil fuel companies mining in the area.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are concerned about leakage from the waste pits into the ground as well as by the wind carrying volatile particles into the air from the mountains of waste above the pools,\u201d says Natalia Machain, executive director of Greenpeace Argentina, which joined the lawsuit as plaintiff this year.\n\nTreater has denied any contamination. \u201cWe are not a waste dump. We are an environmental services company that treats waste from the oil industry.\u201d\n\nBut the Neuqu\u00e9n legislator Santiago Nogueira is pressing for waste management laws because, he says, \u201cthe province does not have enough capacity to process the amount of waste generated by Vaca Muerta\u201d.\n\nTreater is only one of many open-air waste pits dotted across Vaca Muerta. A large mound rises above the Comarsa waste plant about 4 miles (6km) outside Neuqu\u00e9n. Closed by the authorities because of its proximity to a large urban area, the plant no longer receives waste, but bulldozers are constantly at work turning over the mounds of earth on its grounds.\n\nSections of the cement containment wall around the plant have collapsed.\n\n\u201cThere are over 300,000 cubic metres of waste still piled at Comarsa,\u201d said Nogueira. \u201cThe whole waste treatment system is insufficient.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Waste at Comarsa. Photograph: Uki Goni/The Guardian\n\nVaca Muerta has yet to prove its economic viability. Experts say the government\u2019s expectations are hampered by the high cost of fracking in Argentina and the lack of adequate gas transport and waste disposal infrastructure, aggravated by a shaky economy.\n\nThe country has spent billions of dollars in direct handouts to lure\n\ninvestors. \u201cOil companies aren\u2019t extracting hydrocarbons from Vaca Muerta. They\u2019re extracting subsidies,\u201d says Enrique Viale, an environmental lawyer and anti-fracking campaigner.\n\nThe subsidies are ultimately unaffordable for Argentina, according to a report released in March by the Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\nIn January the International Monetary Fund, which had put together a $57bn bailout for Argentina in 2018, demanded a trimming of the subsidies. The industry responded with layoffs, the threat of lawsuits against the government and production cuts. \u201cThe abrupt reduction in Argentina\u2019s production subsidy programme \u2026 is shaking investor confidence,\u201d the report states.\n\nHowever grim the outlook for the oil and gas companies, it is the Mapuche indigenous people who are bearing the highest cost for Argentina\u2019s dream of a fracking bonanza.\n\n\u201cAs Mapuches, we\u2019re not fighting for just ourselves or our community,\u201d says Albino Campo Maripe. \u201cWe want our children and grandchildren to know that we fought for something that belongs to everyone. Water is life. Every plant is life. The greed of governments is killing the world. The world is not going to end. We are going to end, because we\u2019re killing ourselves.\u201d", "description": "Community tell of devastating environmental impact on land where their animals grazed", "authors": ["Uki Go\u00f1i"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c3b12b1405543c8c96cb2a9490b7d1cc6e28a10/191_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e6a66fa3191048996ad74f3c7a8fe866", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
