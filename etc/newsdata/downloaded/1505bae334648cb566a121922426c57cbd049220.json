I wasn't chosen, the players in the awards had exceptional seasons, they deserved to be there, I congratulate these players.\n\n\"I think it's a strong message for me to work harder.\n\n\"I accept, it's hard for me to to say that I deserve to be there, I'm modest enough for that, and the thing is, the choices have been made and I respect them.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nAs humble as he is, though, Mane believes he deserved to be in the Men's World11.\n\nIt's a jury that votes and everyone has their way of seeing things,\" he added.\n\n\"Personally, I would say that I deserve to be there but it's a choice.\n\n\"Others say they prefer Virgil van Dijk, or they prefer Eden Hazard - you just have to congratulate these guys.\"", "description": "Mane was backed by Messi for FIFA gong after an outstanding season, but has so far left empty-handed from awards ceremonies", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20636518.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Burnley-v-Liverpool.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
