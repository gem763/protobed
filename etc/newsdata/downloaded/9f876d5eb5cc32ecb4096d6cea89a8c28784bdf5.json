Consumer spending for July and the latest monthly and annualized core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index will be released at the same time.\n\nChicago PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) and consumer sentiment data for August will follow slightly later in the session.\n\nThere are no major Treasury bond auctions scheduled on Friday.", "description": "U.S. government debt prices were lower Friday morning, after Chinese officials said the country would be open to calmly resolving its trade war with the world's largest economy.", "authors": ["Sam Meredith"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106060345-1565021098577preview-1.jpg?v=1565022512"}
