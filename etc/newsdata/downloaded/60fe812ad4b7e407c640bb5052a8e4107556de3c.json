I think it's important that this transcript is released to Congress so that Congress can do its job. But I think the question of impeachment really would further tear apart an already divided country. I think it's important that Donald Trump is defeated. I believe I can defeat him in 2020. But it's the voters who need to make that choice unequivocally.\"\n\n\"My concern is for our country. United we stand, divided we fall. It's important that Donald Trump is voted out of office by the American people. And I feel very strongly about that,\" she stressed.\n\nNow, she's changed her mind.\n\n\u201cUp to this point, I have been opposed to pursuing impeachment because it will further divide our already badly divided country. However, after looking carefully at the transcript of the conversation with Ukraine\u2019s President, the whistleblower complaint, the Inspector General memo, and President Trump\u2019s comments about the issue, unfortunately, I believe that if we do not proceed with the inquiry, it will set a very dangerous precedent. Future presidents, as well as anyone in positions of power in the government, will conclude that they can abuse their position for personal gain, without fear of accountability or consequences,\" Gabbard released in a statement Friday. \u201cIf we allow the President to abuse his or her power, then our society will rot from top to bottom. We will turn into a banana republic, where people in positions of power\u2014from the president all the way down to the traffic cop\u2014will feel it's okay to abuse their power with no consequences.\"\n\n\u201cThis is not the kind of country that any of us want to see,\" she continued. \u201cSo it is unfortunate, but necessary, that I speak in support of the inquiry into the President\u2019s alleged abuse of power in relation to his interactions with Ukraine\u2019s leaders. This inquiry must be swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused. It cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus that will further divide our country and undermine our democracy.\u201d\n\nGabbard joins a number of House Democrats and other 2020 candidates who have called for impeachment.", "description": ".09/27/2019 20:59:58PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Pavlich", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/0a5b0776-f914-4e49-b934-6403f48bc11a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
