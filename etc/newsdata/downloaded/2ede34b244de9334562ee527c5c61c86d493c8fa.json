It\u2019s also a giant scam that is perpetually gross, and sometimes even terrifying, to be around.\n\nThis might sound weird considering this is a sports game, but 2K\u2019s basketball titles are some of the hardest things I ever have to review for this site. What I perceive to be the \u201cgood\u201d and the \u201cbad\u201d of each entry in the series aren\u2019t things that can be easily separated. In 2K20 they\u2019re intertwined, everything good about it undermined by \u2014 and indivisible from \u2014 everything bad.\n\nWait, is this a review of NBA 2K20? Nope. As we always do, this is only a review of 2K20's MyCareer mode, not the entire game. I think its scope, coupled with the focus 2K places on it in terms of creating and selling their game, make it interesting enough to warrant this focus.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken so much about this game\u2019s obsession with microtransactions at this point that I don\u2019t want to bore you again here. Suffice to say, NBA 2K20 \u2014 a full-priced retail game \u2014 is rotten with attempts to get you to spend real money on everything from players to clothing to player stats. Some game modes, like MyTeam, are built entirely around this thirst, but even in MyCareer\u2019s singleplayer you\u2019re being hounded.\n\nFor years 2K\u2019s MyCareer storylines have been a disaster, saddled with ludicrous paths to the NBA and downright embarrassing attempts at \u201chello fellow kids\u201d humour. That\u2019s all been replaced in 2K20 with the earnest tale of a college kid who takes a principled stand against organisational hijinx, only to see his draft stock plummet.\n\nAn unexpectedly topical jab at the NCAA, this year\u2019s MyCareer story has you play a handful of college games before embarking on a journey towards the NBA that includes invitational tournaments, the Draft Combine (complete with mini-games for stuff like vertical leap) and Summer League.\n\nIt\u2019s a lightning-fast introduction, which you\u2019ll blow through in only a few hours, but it\u2019s also by far and away the most authentic career path the series has ever managed. Like FIFA\u2019s The Journey, while this certainly has its hokey moments, it\u2019s sincere with most of what it\u2019s attempting, and slots in nicely alongside your actual NBA play as a result.\n\nIt\u2019s wild remembering that only two years ago players were cast as a DJ getting invited to practice with an NBA team, only this year to live the more realistic life of a high profile college recruit, agent discussions and all.\n\nMyCareer\u2019s story \u2014 particularly during its cutscene-heavy prologue \u2014 is a fulfilment of almost everything the mode has been trying to do for years now. Celebrity cameos (particularly Idris Elba\u2019s performance as your coach) are tasteful and very well-done, the story skips along without lingering too long in any one place (last year\u2019s G-League focus went for waaaaaaay too long) and by the time you\u2019re an established NBA player you really feel like you\u2019ve earned your place.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely no surprise to find, then, that all this progress is then swiftly undone, not just by the series\u2019 usual microtransaction nonsense, but by 2K\u2019s slavish hunger for Brands\u2122 as well.\n\nThis year\u2019s story mode was handled by SpringHill, LeBron James\u2019 own production company (James is credited as Executive Producer), and the setup for MyCareer\u2019s attack on the NCAA feels more like an ad for SpringHill (especially when you consider the personal beef) than a genuine attempt to explore the issue, especially since the company\u2019s co-founder Maverick Carter is one of the more prominent characters in the story prologue.\n\nThis is most evident, and depressing, in the way your player\u2019s conflict with the college establishment is portrayed. After a teammate is injured and has his scholarship cut, you take a stand against your coach and school, and as a result find yourself benched ahead of the most important game of the season.\n\nIt\u2019s a brave thing to do, but the way the game handles it after the fact is typical of where the series finds itself in 2019. After meeting an agent, you\u2019re quickly introduced to Carter, who views your actions through the lens of what kind of sponsorship deals you can attract, and which Brands\u2122 want to share your story (including his own).\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the extent of how NBA 2K20 views an act of personal sacrifice, one that barely scratches the surface of some of the more pressing issues affecting college sports and how it compensates the athletes that drive its profits... As a marketing stunt. An opportunity to sign some contracts. Like they looked at Colin Kaepernick\u2019s struggles with the NFL and all they got out of it was his Nike deal.\n\nThe series, which has long been pioneering ways for Brands\u2122 to infiltrate every corner of your experience on the court, from Gatorade-infused timeouts to Nike and Adidas apparel contracts, has finally found a way to weave them into the story itself.\n\nEvery season I complain that 2K\u2019s desire for microtransaction spending and advertiser encroachment has got worse, every year I hope the next edition of the game addresses at least some of that, and every year I\u2019m left increasingly disappointed.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this! No other major sports game tries to pull this kind of shit. Even EA, the supposed wORsT coMpaNY iN VidEO gAmES, has the sense to keep its brand partnerships limited to realistic broadcast expectations, and to not charge players for singleplayer game mode content.\n\nAnd yet year after year 2K, despite intense fan protest online, turn the dial up and try to squeeze everyone just a little bit more. Clearly there are millions of fans who either don\u2019t care, or are at least willing to suffer through it all, and it\u2019s for these players that 2K is happy to continue building their entire game around the central conceits of microtransactions and advertising.\n\nBut for me, someone who just wants to have a little story alongside a singleplayer sports experience \u2014 which I really enjoy when I\u2019m on the court! \u2014 NBA 2K20 is a new low.", "description": "NBA 2K20 is one of the best sports games I\u2019ve played in a long time.
