This time, instead of a platform that allows users to download copyright songs and television series, Dotcom plans to use blockchain technology to create a fair digital content distribution market called K.IM.\n\nAccording to K.IM\u2019s white paper, the proposed project is pitched as a dynamic ecosystem that is \u201caimed to become the easiest and the most secure way to generate revenue with digital content.\u201d\n\nThe project plans to facilitate consumer and publisher transactions while cutting out the middleman with the help of the Kimcoin. Bitfinex, the cryptocurrency exchange in partnership with Dotcom\u2019s platform, has recently announced the sale of the K.IM with the relaunch of its initial exchange offering (IEO) platform, Toikinex.\n\nProject overview\n\nThe K.IM project has so far raised over $2 million from investors and is planned to be fully operational by the third quarter of 2020, according to the project\u2019s road map. K.IM says it aims to fill up a content monetization gap in a market worth over $400 billion.\n\nAccording to the project\u2019s white paper, the infiltration of multiple intermediaries in the digital content business has introduced an inability to offer content at ultra-low prices. With a business model that gives 95% of sales revenue to content creators, the K.IM platform will aim to boost monetization while attracting publishers to participate.\n\nSome of the key features of the platform include content pricing and entails the use of a file encryption service. Users will be able to pay for content with a range of cryptocurrencies. However, only Bitcoin (BTC) and K.IM will be available at the start.\n\nK.IM will serve as a utility coin that will allow users to purchase content, donate or tip on the platform. The project\u2019s road map also states that K.IM will be issued in the last quarter of 2019, with a token sale on Bitfinex set to take place on Oct. 22.\n\nWhile commenting on the project\u2019s development, Dotcom mentioned that \u201ccombining the internet with Bitcoin gives a real chance of achieving the original promise of the internet,\u201d defining that promise as freedom of speech, finance and commerce. He also added that his main motivation for launching the platforms is to \u201ccut out all the middlemen and sell content and digital goods without censorship.\u201d In an email conversation, Kim Dotcom told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cK.im will work on policies, designs, and technologies that attempt to address the many complex issues of international copyright compliance for user-generated content intermediary services and related risks.\u201d\n\nDotcom also acknowledged that recent technical breakthroughs such as Bitcoin\u2019s Lightning Network have enabled the creation of tokens such as K.IM that can be supported on Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain network.\n\nWill Megaupload cast a dark shadow on K.IM?\n\nFar from the noble intentions of giving users freedom and access to digital goods, Dotcom\u2019s alleged reputation of making millions of dollars by allowing illegal file sharing on Megaupload still casts a shadow on his new project.\n\nFor some, it is a little surprising that a defunct platform whose founder has been locked in a legal battle with the United States over copyright claims is now spearheading a project that will create a fair market for content creators.\n\nIn response, Dotcom has replied that the technology the project is built upon allows users to sell their content without K.IM\u2019s knowledge of what content they are selling. Therefore, content publishers will have absolute control of their content with encrypted file protection.\n\nWhile talking to Hard Fork, Dotcom also said that the platform aims to \u201crespect the rights of copyright owners by establishing policies in its terms of use.\u201d\n\nHe told Max Keiser from KeiserReport that the platform will implement a content hosting platform with a \u201cdecentralized structure,\u201d which will have an API that will enable users to add their servers from anywhere across the globe. Dotcom also added that the platform will \u201callow users to report\u201d anything illegal on the platforms as a community policing strategy.\n\nIEOs as the new ICOs\n\nBy definition, an IEO entails the partnership between a project and an exchange to sell the project\u2019s tokens through the exchange. IEOs are touted as a less risky alternative to initial coin offerings (ICOs). While an ICO involves the selling of a project\u2019s tokens directly to the buyer, IEO tokens undergo a vetting process that gives purchasers more confidence.\n\nRelated: IEOs, ICOs, STOs and Now IDOs \u2014 How to Raise Funds for Crypto in 2019?\n\nAlso, projects such as K.IM can outsource their marketing as well as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance to the exchange platform. This makes it easy for project managers to navigate through various regulatory requirements.\n\nFor this reason, the K.IM project has partnered with Bitfinex in what Dotcom calls \u201cthe perfect partner to help distribute the KIM tokens.\u201d\n\nGiven that 75% of IEO tokens have reportedly lost more than 50% of their value, how will Dotcom\u2019s project differentiate its value proposition for a successful token sale? Dotcom told Cointelegraph, \u201ca token sale using Bitfinex was an easy choice.\u201d He added,\n\n\u201cWe want to distribute our token as widely as possible amongst the bitcoin community for first and early use of the platform.\u201d\n\nExploring the niche\n\nWith the increase of censorship from existing content distribution platforms, there is arguably a market for a decentralized and neutral platform like K.IM that will increase going forward. The K.IM ecosystem can revolutionize the digital content industry with improved monetization that benefits creators as well as consumers.\n\nThis can all be achieved while promoting freedom of speech \u2014 that is, if the project delivers the promises outlined in its white paper. Furthermore, Dotcom confirmed to Cointelegraph that:\n\n\u201cThe token piggybacks off cutting edge open-source technology such as the Bitcoin lightning network and its future integration with liquid tokens. In a nutshell, the token aims to allow for fast, cheap and virtually free micropayments for artists and content creators through the K.im platform.\u201d\n\nDespite the noble intentions of the project and the choice to go the IEO way, certain drawbacks might trigger concern over the project\u2019s success. For example, Bitfinex has been hacked on several occasions. The first instance in 2015 led to a loss of more than 1,500 Bitcoins, and a year later, nearly 120,000 Bitcoins were stolen from the exchange.\n\nThis year, the exchange has been criticized over its affiliation with Tether in possible cover-up of over $850 million in lost crypto. In addition to Dotcom\u2019s past controversies, the legal issues associated with Bitfinex could affect K.IM\u2019s success.\n\nFor now, however, it remains to be seen whether K.IM will be successful in delivering the promise of the internet through the blockchain.", "description": "Kim Dotcom set to launch an IEO on Bitfinex for a project that will improve the digital content business", "authors": ["Jinia Shawdagor"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYjAyOGUyOTkwZWQ2ODQ0Yzg2MzFjNDg5MDY2ZjNmM2YuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
