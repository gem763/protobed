A mistake from myself, sloppy, I could have done better there and it takes the gloss off it.\n\n\u201cNow I am thinking I am not that happy, I have made a mistake they have scored, (Harry) Maguire\u2019s given a penalty away, Keano (Michael Keane) made a mistake.\n\n\u201cBut it is part and parcel, we are never going to be perfect. The main thing is we got the three points and we are unbeaten.\u201d\n\nAs with the Nations League defeat to Netherlands in the summer, the dangers of playing out from the back were highlighted with the way England conceded two of their goals as Keane and Rice gave the ball away in dangerous positions.\n\nRice insists England are not going to change their approach.\n\n\u201cThe way we have been working all week on building from the back, playing through the lines, the manager is never going to change that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe manager is never going to go route one, he is going to live by that.\n\n\u201cWe kept getting on the ball, we could have scored another two or three in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt was really strange, conceding the goal in the first 30 seconds, it was tough to take mentally.\n\n\u201cYou see how good we were in the first half to score five, how good we were going forward, the threat we had.\n\n\u201cFirst half I thought we were top, then second half I don\u2019t know what happened, a couple of mistakes from me, the penalty and it looked like we had a tough task on our hands.\n\n\u201cLuckily enough we took control of the game, got a foothold and managed to see the game out.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "England\u00a0midfielder Declan Rice says the shine was taken off the Euro 2020 qualifying win over Kosovo by their defensive lapses.
