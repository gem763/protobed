The desk eventually sold to another telephone client for \u20ac5.4 million with fees.\n\nA rhino desk by Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lalanne sold for 5.4 million euro with fees at a Sotheby\u2019s. Sotheby's\n\nThe French sculptors known collectively as \"Les Lalanne\"\u2013 the husband-and-wife team of Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lalanne, who died in 2008, and Claude Lalanne \u2013 are among the few names capable of creating serious excitement in the niche world of design auctions.\n\nThey certainly did so last week, when Sotheby's raised \u20ac48 million from a sellout session of 41 lots, the first in a two-day auction of works from the Lalannes' personal collection. The low estimate for the entire sale of more than 270 lots was \u20ac15.9 million.\n\nMost of the pieces at Sotheby's had been made by the Lalannes in their farmyard studios at Ury, south of Paris, where the couple had lived and worked since 1967. Claude Lalanne died in April at age 93, survived by four daughters. Estates in France valued at more than \u20ac1.8 million incur inheritance tax of 45 per cent, so the death of a successful French artist is often followed by studio sales.\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Xavier Lalanne\u2019s animal sculptures combine form and function in whimsical ways, like these sheep that function as chairs. Capucine de Chabaneix for Sotheby's,\n\nBlurring the boundaries between art and design, the Lalannes' playfully surreal bronze creations have had a cult following since the 1960s. Gunter Sachs and Yves Saint Laurent were among the Lalannes' early patrons, while more recent collectors have included Peter Marino in the United States, Fran\u00e7ois Pinault and Bernard Arnault.\n\n\"As always with this kind of sale, what seems expensive will turn out to look cheap, and the cheap will look expensive,\" said Ben Brown, a dealer with galleries in London and Hong Kong who has exhibited Les Lalanne since 2007.\n\nBrown, seated in the front row of the saleroom, gave the second-highest bid for Rhinocr\u00e9taire, the most expensive lot in the auction. \"It was the bargain of the sale,\" he said. \"It was a masterpiece.\"", "description": "The sculptors known collectively as \"Les Lalanne\" are among the few names capable of creating serious excitement in the niche world of design auctions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3991%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_91%2C$y_231/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8ee597f50db45b7b8e01a46e24cb559727e2eb2c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
