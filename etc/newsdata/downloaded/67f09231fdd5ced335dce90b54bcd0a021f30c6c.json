Unlike several of the administration officials who have already testified, they were both close advisers of Mr. Trump, dealt directly with him on Ukraine policy and could testify about what Mr. Trump said behind closed doors.\n\nMr. Trump and the White House have attacked many of the career State Department officials who have appeared before investigators on Capitol Hill, calling them \u201cunelected bureaucrats.\u201d But Mr. Kupperman and Mr. Bolton, longtime Republicans, worked directly for Mr. Trump. Mr. Bolton, in particular, is seen as potentially having greater sway with Republicans and independents because of his hawkish views, which he conveyed regularly on Fox News before joining the administration.\n\nHouse Democrats are investigating whether Mr. Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to pressure the country\u2019s president to conduct investigations that could help him politically. After Mr. Bolton resigned on Sept. 10, Mr. Kupperman took over as the acting national security adviser. The next day, Mr. Trump released the $391 million in aid that he had withheld.\n\n\u201cConstitutional immunity\u201d is essentially executive privilege on steroids. Mr. Kupperman said in the lawsuit that Mr. Trump\u2019s White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, had ordered him not to comply with the subpoena. The president\u2019s legal team apparently issued the same advice it had given other former top White House aides, like Mr. Cipollone\u2019s predecessor, Donald F. McGahn II, who had been asked to testify before lawmakers in the spring: They are absolutely immune from being forced to testify to Congress about their official duties, meaning they do not even have to show up.\n\n\u201cThe president, however, acting through the White House counsel, has asserted that plaintiff, as a close personal adviser to the president, is immune from congressional process, and has instructed plaintiff not to appear and testify in response to the House\u2019s subpoena,\u201d the lawsuit said.", "description": "The move raises new doubts about whether President Trump\u2019s closest aides will be able to cooperate with the inquiry.", "authors": ["Michael S.
