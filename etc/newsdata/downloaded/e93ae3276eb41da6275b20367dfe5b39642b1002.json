Inaction", "language": "en", "text": "In 2009, not long after Dr. Margaret Hamburg became commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, a package arrived at her home. Inside was a clunky device called an e-cigarette.\n\n\u201cIt was my first exposure to this emerging, new technology,\u201d Dr. Hamburg recalled.\n\nThe package was sent by an antismoking activist as a warning about a product that was taking off in the United States. But over the next decade, the federal government \u2014 across the span of two presidential administrations \u2014 allowed the rise of a largely unregulated industry that may be addicting a new generation to nicotine.\n\nE-cigarettes and vaping devices, with $7 billion in annual sales, have become a part of daily life for millions of Americans. Youth use has skyrocketed with the proliferation of flavors targeting teenagers, such as Bazooka Joe Bubble Gum and Zombie Blood. And nearly 1,300 people have been sickened by mysterious vaping-related lung injuries this year.\n\nYet the agency has not vetted the vast majority of vaping devices or flavored liquids for safety.\n\nIn dozens of interviews, federal officials and public health experts described a lost decade of inaction, blaming an intense lobbying effort by the e-cigarette and tobacco industries, fears of a political backlash in tobacco-friendly states, bureaucratic delays, and a late reprieve by an F.D.A. commissioner who had previously served on the board of a chain of vaping lounges.", "description": "A decade after Congress gave the F.D.A. the power to regulate tobacco products like e-cigarettes, the federal government has repeatedly delayed or weakened efforts that could have protected teenagers.", "authors": ["Katie Thomas", "Sheila Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/14/science/14VAPING-REG2/merlin_160778304_8ad9975a-c1ef-4ba7-8bf7-3569e736c5b2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
