Traveling will be an emphasis this season for officials, who are determined not to allow offensive players to gain an extra edge by taking an extra step.\n\nScoring stars like Harden already got an advantage once hand-checking on the perimeter was no longer legal, so they can\u2019t be given another one.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t allow people to hand check, we can\u2019t allow them to travel because then they\u2019re almost unguardable,\u201d vice president of referee operations Mark Wunderlich said.\n\nThat said, most times when Harden does his signature step-back, he doesn\u2019t travel.\n\n\u201cIt is legal, except for the fact that he gets a third step in every now and then when his rhythm is just off, which shows you the highlight of how difficult it is,\u201d said Monty McCutchen, the NBA\u2019s head of referee development and training.\n\nThat\u2019s why referees are working harder to get it right.\n\nCritics of the NBA - and even some fans - have long sneered that the league doesn\u2019t call traveling. McCutchen said data showed officials were missing about two per game, but the way the game is played today can make those misses more penal for the defense.\n\nPlayers are bigger, faster and more skilled, and even big men who would have been centers in a previous generation are now do-everything forwards like 6-foot-11 MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. He already gets far enough with the two steps that are legal, forget when allowed a third.\n\nMcCutchen compared the difference with Tiny Archibald, a 6-1 guard who played in the 1970s and \u201880s.\n\n\u201cHe covered 10 feet with his two steps,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cHow far is Giannis covering? The game has changed.\u201d\n\nSo officials have begun to change with it, altering the way they were taught to officiate when McCutchen and Wunderlich were on the floor. Before, referees were trained to look first at the defensive player. Now they have reversed their sequencing, looking first at the offensive player\u2019s feet to make certain a legal pivot foot has been established and not changed.\n\nAnd the league added new language in the rule book to define the \u201cgather,\u201d to clarify how many steps a player can take after receiving the ball or completing his dribble.\n\nAt the referees\u2019 preseason meetings and training camp last week, McCutchen said officials studied replays of three travels each time they returned from a break, and had a dedicated 45-minute session on traveling.\n\nAn educational video was sent to teams , and the referees visited the coaches\u2019 preseason meetings, where they had a traveling station with two players on the floor so they could do demonstrations for the coaches.\n\nAnd Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said the league stressed that Harden\u2019s step-back jumper is legal.\n\n\u201cThey made a point, which is great, to tell every head coach that is not traveling. It\u2019s not traveling,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cSo hopefully coaches will quit complaining and hopefully you guys in the news will understand that that\u2019s not traveling. There\u2019s other points that we have to clean up that are traveling and the NBA is going to try to do a better job of that.\u201d\n\nSan Antonio coach Gregg Popovich quipped last year that the step-back 3 came when players \u201cjump backwards and travel and shoot a 3.\u201d But the leaders of the referee team praised Harden for his cleverness and creativity.\n\n\u201cOn the dribble, we always talk about dribbling you can take two legal steps to the basket, right? No one ever thought about on the gather after you dribble you can take two legal steps backwards,\u201d Wunderlich said.\n\nAdded Jason Phillips, who will oversee the Replay Center: \u201cThe rulebook doesn\u2019t state that the two steps have to be in any direction.\u201d\n\nHarden said it never should have been a debate, because if he was traveling then referees would have been whistling him for it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing that\u2019s a travel, from coaches, from other players, from haters, fans, whatever you want to call it,\u201d Harden said.\n\nBut he acknowledges it looks awkward, so the referees know they have to educate teams and fans just as much as themselves. There is no new rule or even a new interpretation of traveling, just a desire to correctly call the travels that are in the books.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s the biggest emphasis on the preseason list of points of education.\n\n\u201cThe first one is traveling and the second one is traveling and the third, fourth and fifth one are traveling,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cI\u2019m only joking to show that there are POEs and then there are POEs. We really want to get better at our fundamentals of the game and traveling is a big part of that.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Brian Mahoney on Twitter at https://twitter.com/briancmahoney\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "James Harden slides sideways or steps backward, and the screaming starts.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/rockets_media_day_basketball_49980_c0-203-4849-3030_s1770x1032.jpg?0294246ef6521e09a2b7e7f1990e53bf9366ca05", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
