Their injuries are serious but not life threatening, police said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement this afternoon, DCS Hunter said officers were called at 11.59pm to reports of a stabbing.\n\nHe said: \u2018Clearly this is a dreadful incident and we are in the very early stages of the investigation.\n\n\u2018We have deployed significant resources and it is, and will continue to be, a fast moving investigation led by our Major Crime Unit.\n\n\u2018Our thoughts go out to the families of the victims and we have deployed specially trained officers to support them.\u2019\n\nHe continued: \u2018We remain on the scene at Archford Croft in Emerson Valley and a scene has been cordoned off while the investigation continues. This scene is likely to remain for several days.\n\n\u2018I fully appreciate the concern that this will cause in the local community and beyond, but at this early stage, I believe the people directly involved in this incident are all likely to have known each other.\u2019\n\nPolice are yet to confirm the identities of Dominic Ansah (pictured) or Benjamin Rice but said their next of kin have been informed (Picture: Facebook)\n\nThe road has been cordoned off by police (Picture: SBNA)\n\nPolice at the scene, where they said around 15-20 people were invited (Picture: Geoff Robinson)\n\nHe added that \u2018around 15 to 20 people\u2019 were at the house party last night and all those present were speaking to police.\n\nOn Sunday, what appeared to be blood was smeared across the front door of a house in Archford Croft.\n\nTwo forensic officers could be seen inspecting an object on the driveway next to a black BMW.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne neighbour \u2013 who did not wish to be named \u2013 said she heard a \u2018commotion\u2019 involving screaming, shortly before midnight, but did not see what happened.\n\nShe added: \u2018The police were here pretty quick.\u2019\n\nAnother neighbour, who lives in an adjacent cul-de-sac, said that she knew the boys but declined to give their names.\n\nShe said: \u2018This gang of kids have been hanging around Archford Croft \u2013 it\u2019s all gang-related.\n\n\u2018We do know that there was a house party at the time, not here but another part of Emerson.
