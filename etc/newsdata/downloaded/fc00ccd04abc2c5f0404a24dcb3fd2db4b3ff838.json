I was out in Birmingham racing. I pulled out of the race in 2015.\n\n\u201cI flew to Portland to get some answers from Alberto.\n\n\u201cI talked to him face to face and he assured me at the time that it was just an allegation, this is not true, there are no allegations against you, Mo.\n\n\u201cHe promised me and that hasn\u2019t been true.\u201d\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nSalazar's suspension was handed down in the midst of the recent world championships in Doha - which is when Farah first heard the news of his former coach's ban.\n\nFarah worked with Salazar between 2011 and 2017 on the Nike Oregon Project - which has announced it will shut down following the verdict.\n\nA USADA report suggested Salazar was involved in the use of a prohibited method to meddle with doping control processes and the trafficking of the banned substance testosterone. He is now appealing the ban.\n\nThe report also named Dr Jeffrey Brown, who was \u201ccomplicit with Salazar in prescribing excessive and dangerous levels\u201d of performance enhancing substances.\n\nFarah said he \u201cwas never given anything and I haven\u2019t seen Dr Brown\u201d, and added: \"It\u2019s not my decision to shut down the Oregon Project. It\u2019s Nike\u2019s decision \u2013 I\u2019m Mo Farah.\"\n\nHe is due to defend his Chicago marathon title on Sunday, and denied any claims of doping against him and accused others of launching a witch-hunt.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t failed any tests, Farah added. \"I\u2019m happy to be tested anytime and anywhere. My tests can be used as samples and research. There is no more I can do.\n\n\u201cI have no tolerance for anyone who crosses the line. I have said that from day one.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear agenda to this. I have seen it many times. I have seen it with Raheem Sterling. I\u2019ve seen it with Lewis Hamilton. I can\u2019t win whatever I do.\u201d", "description": "Farah was quizzed by journalists ahead of the Chicago Marathon after his former coach Salazar was handed a four-year ban", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20562803.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DMP_CHP__21681FarahJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
