And one of our best values in America is free speech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re allowed to say what we want to say and we\u2019re allowed to speak up on injustices, and that\u2019s just how it goes.\n\n\u201cDaryl Morey was right,\u201d Shaq explained. \u201cWhenever you see something going on wrong anywhere in the world, you should have the right to say \u2018That\u2019s not right,\u2019 and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d\n\nWatch:\n\nShaq on Daryl Morey/China \"One of our best values here in America is free speech we're allowed to say what we want to say and we are allowed to speak out on injustices and that's just how it goes. and if people don't understand that that's something they have to deal with. pic.twitter.com/vefcHSPlMD \u2014 gifdsports (@gifdsports) October 22, 2019\n\nThough acknowledging that when it comes to business, \u201csometimes you have to tiptoe around things.\u201d He asserted, however, \u201cwe have the right to speak.\n\n\u201cEspecially with social media. We can say whatever we want to say, when we want to say it.\u201d\n\nThe comments stand in stark contrast to those of O\u2019Neal\u2019s co-host and fellow NBA legend Charles Barkley, who adamantly defended LeBron James against the backlash he received for criticizing Morey and pointing out the \u201cnegative\u201d side-effects of free speech.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said that the NBA suffered significant financial losses as a result of the NBA\u2019s rift with the communist nation. However, he has also steadfastly maintained that Morey will not be disciplined or fired for his comments.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "NBA Hall of Famer and TNT commentator Shaquille O'Neal defended free speech during the opening night telecast of The NBA on TNT, and said", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo-John-Raoux-640x480-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
