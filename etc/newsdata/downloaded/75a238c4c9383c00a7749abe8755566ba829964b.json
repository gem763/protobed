The current mayor, London Breed, was once an intern in Mr. Brown\u2019s administration.\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s example is more complicated. She began dating Mr. Brown, now 85, around 1994, when she was working in Alameda County and he was speaker of the California Assembly. He appointed her to two well-compensated state posts. He gave her a BMW. He introduced her to people worth knowing.\n\n\u201cWhen I first met her, she was Willie\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d said John Burton, a former congressman and chairman of the California Democratic Party. \u201cEverybody gets their start through somebody else. Jack Kennedy got his start through his father. Bobby got his start through Jack.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris\u2019s allies have bristled at any suggestion that Mr. Brown powered her ascent, dismissing the charge as sexist and making clear that she was plenty capable of impressing on her own. Few could argue that Ms. Harris, hovering around 5 percent in early polling, entered the 2003 race at much of an advantage, even as her fund-raising drew on an ungainly Filofax full of high-end contacts. (Eventually, friends insisted she transfer to a Palm Pilot.)\n\nFair or not, Ms. Harris understood quickly that Mr. Brown would shadow the campaign. \u201cNo woman likes to be judged by who she dates,\u201d said Rebecca Prozan, a top 2003 campaign aide. \u201cWas it something that we wanted to address? No. Was it something we had to address? Yes.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris hoped to maintain distance without alienating his supporters. An internal memo suggested hiring Mr. Stearns as a consultant in part because he was associated with \u201cthe anti-Willie Brown camp which may be helpful.\u201d Ms. Harris told SF Weekly in 2003 that she was so independent of Mr. Brown that he \u201cwould probably right now express some fright about the fact that he cannot control me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis career is over,\u201d she said, as Mr. Brown\u2019s second mayoral term wound down. \u201cI will be alive and kicking for the next 40 years.\u201d", "description": "In her first race, she defied her old boss, a fund-raising pledge \u2014 and the implication that she owed her career to her ex-boyfriend.", "authors": ["Matt Flegenheimer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/us/politics/00harris-da-1-promo/00harris-da-1-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
