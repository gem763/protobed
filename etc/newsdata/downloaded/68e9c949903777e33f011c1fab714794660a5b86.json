Across China, the party is now imposing new restrictions on Islamic customs and practices, in line with a confidential party directive, parts of which have been seen by The New York Times.\n\nThe measures reflect the hard-line policies of China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, who has sought to reassert the primacy of the Communist Party and its ideology in all walks of life.\n\nThe campaign has prompted concerns that the repression of Uighur Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang has begun to bleed into other parts of China, targeting Hui and other Muslims who have been better integrated than Uighurs into Chinese society.\n\nLast year, a top party official from Ningxia praised Xinjiang\u2019s government during a visit there and pledged to increase cooperation between the two regions on security matters.\n\nHaiyun Ma, a Hui Muslim professor at Frostburg State University in Maryland, said the crackdown was continuing a long history of animosity towards Islam in China that has alienated believers.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But they have already stirred anxiety among the Hui, who number more than 10 million.\n\n\u201cWe are now backtracking again,\u201d Cui Haoxin, a Hui Muslim poet who publishes under the name An Ran, said in an interview in Jinan, south of Beijing, where he lives.\n\nTo Cui, the methods of repression that are smothering Uighur society in Xinjiang now loom over all of China. \u201cOne day, this model will not only target Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone will be harmed by it.\u201d\n\nIslam has had followers in China for centuries. There are now 22 million to 23 million Muslims, a tiny minority in a country of 1.4 billion. Among them, the Hui and the Uighurs make up the largest ethnic groups. Uighurs primarily live in Xinjiang, but the Hui live in enclaves scattered around the nation.\n\nThe restrictions they now face can be traced to 2015, when Xi first raised the issue of what he called the \u201cSinicisation of Islam,\u201d saying all faiths should be subordinate to Chinese culture and the Communist Party.\n\nLast year, Xi\u2019s government issued a confidential directive that ordered local officials to prevent Islam from interfering with secular life and the state\u2019s functions.\n\nCritics of China\u2019s policies who are outside the country provided excerpts from the directive to The New York Times. The directive, titled \u201cReinforcing and Improving Islam Work in the New Situation,\u201d has not been made public. It was issued by the State Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, in April of last year and classified as confidential for 20 years.\n\nThe directive warns against the \u201cArabisation\u201d of Islamic places, fashions and rituals in China, singling out the influence of Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam\u2019s holiest sites, as a cause for concern.\n\nIt prohibits the use of the Islamic financial system. It bars mosques or other private Islamic organisations from organising kindergartens or after-school programmes, and it forbids Arabic-language schools to teach religion or send students abroad to study.\n\nThe most visible aspect of the crackdown has been the targeting of mosques built with domes, minarets and other architectural details characteristic of Central Asia or the Arabic world.\n\nTaken in isolation, some of these measures seem limited. Others seem capricious: some mosques with Arabic features have been left untouched, while others nearby have been altered or shut down.\n\nBut on a national scale, the trend is clear. Cui, the poet, calls it the harshest campaign against faith since the end of the Cultural Revolution, when so-called Red Guards unleashed by Mao Zedong destroyed mosques across the country.\n\nIn the state\u2019s view, the spread of Islamic customs dangerously subverts social and political conformity.\n\nIn Ningxia, the provincial government banned public displays of Arabic script, even removing the word \u201chalal\u201d from the official seal it distributes to restaurants that follow Islamic customs for preparing food. The seals now use Chinese characters. That prohibition spread this summer to Beijing and elsewhere.\n\nThe authorities in several provinces have stopped distributing halal certificates for food, dairy and wheat producers and restaurants. Chinese state media have described this as an effort to curb a \u201cpan-halal tendency\u201d in which Islamic standards are being applied, in the government\u2019s view, to too many types of foods or restaurants.\n\nNingxia and Gansu have also banned the traditional call to prayer. Around historical mosques there, prayer times are now announced with a grating claxon. One imam in Ningxia\u2019s capital, Yinchuan, said authorities had recently visited and warned him to make no public statements on religious matters.\n\nAuthorities have also targeted the mosques themselves. In Gansu, construction workers in Gazhuang, a village near Linxia, descended on a mosque in April, tearing off its golden dome. It has not yet reopened. Plainclothes policemen prevented two Times journalists from entering.\n\nIn the southern province of Yunnan, where there have long been Hui communities, authorities last December padlocked mosques in three small villages that had been run without official permission. There were protests and brief scuffles with police, to no avail. The county issued a statement accusing the mosques of holding illegal religious activities and classes.\n\nIn one of the villages, Huihuideng, Ma Jiwu carried his grandson outside the shuttered local mosque, which had operated inside a home.\n\nMr Ma, wearing the distinctive skullcap that many Hui wear, said the imams there had ignored warnings to move their services to the village\u2019s main mosque, where a Chinese flag hangs in the central courtyard and a large red banner exhorts worshippers, \u201cLove your country, love your religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did not listen,\u201d Mr Ma said.\n\nNear the main mosque, a woman said the closing of the smaller one had stirred resentment, but also a feeling of resignation. She used a Chinese idiom for helplessness against a superior force, in this case the government: \u201cThe arm cannot twist the thigh.\u201d\n\nXiong Kunxin, a professor of ethnic studies at Minzu University in Beijing, defended the government\u2019s recent actions. He said that China\u2019s far-reaching economic changes over the last 40 years had been accompanied by a loosening of restrictions on religious practice, but that the laxity had gone too far.\n\n\u201cNow China\u2019s economic development has reached a certain height,\u201d he said, \u201cand suddenly problems related to religious and other affairs are being discovered.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Islam, he cited the proliferation of mosques and the spread of \u201chalal\u201d practices into public life, saying they conflicted with the cultural values of the majority Han Chinese population.\n\nOfficial statistics indicate that there are now more mosques in China than Buddhist temples: 35,000 compared with 33,500. In the last year, scores of mosques have been altered, closed or destroyed entirely, many of them in Xinjiang, according to officials and news reports.\n\nThe party asserts that it has the right to control all organised religion. Critics ascribe that to its fear that religious organisations could challenge its political power. In the past, the party\u2019s repression has triggered violent responses.\n\nIn 1975, during Mao\u2019s Cultural Revolution, the People\u2019s Liberation Army surrounded Shadian, a mostly Hui Muslim town in Yunnan province where residents had protested the closure of mosques. Clashes ensued, prompting a massive military intervention that razed the town and left more than 1,600 people dead.\n\nThe current pressure has also been met with unrest, though not on that scale. In August 2018 in Weizhou, a village in Ningxia, protests erupted when the authorities sent demolition workers to a newly built mosque. After a tense showdown that lasted several days, the local government promised to suspend the destruction and review the plans.\n\nNearly a year later, police officers still block the roads into the village, turning away foreigners, including diplomats and two Times journalists who tried to visit in May.\n\nChina claims that it allows freedom of religion, but emphasises that the state must always come first. The Ningxia government, asked about its recent restrictions on Islam, said that China had rules on religious practice just like any other country.\n\nMosques that violate laws such as building codes will be closed, it said, and schools and universities will not permit religious activities.\n\n\u201cArabic is a foreign language,\u201d the government said about the restrictions on public signage, adding that they had been imposed \u201cto make things convenient for the general public.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Ma, the Frostburg State scholar, said the current leadership viewed religion as \u201cthe major enemy the state faces.\u201d He said senior officials had studied the role played by faith \u2014 particularly the Catholic Church in Poland \u2014 in the collapse of the Soviet Union and its dominion in Eastern Europe.\n\nBelievers have little recourse against the intensifying crackdown. Ma predicted that it would not relent soon, but that it would ultimately fail, as other campaigns against Muslims have.\n\n\u201cI really doubt they can eliminate religious faith,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is impossible.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "In China\u2019s northwest, the government is stripping the most overt expressions of the Islamic faith from a picturesque valley where most residents are devout Muslims.
