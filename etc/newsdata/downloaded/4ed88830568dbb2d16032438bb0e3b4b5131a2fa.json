Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have amassed 240 million subscribers worldwide, with almost 20 million in the UK.\n\nApple TV+ will launch on 1 November, with star attractions including Jennifer Aniston in her first TV series since Friends, a comedy drama called The Morning Show with fellow A-listers Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.\n\nTwo weeks later, Disney+ will launch with content including the Star Wars films and original $100m TV series The Mandalorian, the Marvel universe, again including exclusive TV series spin-offs, Pixar films and family fare from Toy Story to Frozen, plus TV shows such as The Simpsons.\n\nThe first half of next year will bring the arrival of WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max, which owns the film studio behind The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, the DC Comics superheroes including Batman and Superman, and HBO shows including Big Little Lies. In the US, it has taken back the rights to Netflix\u2019s most watched show, Friends, and snapped up The Big Bang Theory.\n\nSky-owner Comcast\u2019s Peacock streaming service from NBCUniversal, which owns the Universal film studio behind the Jurassic World and The Fast and the Furious franchises, will also launch next year.\n\nNetflix has significantly increased the number of its European productions this year, with 221 projects, including 153 originals, with a budget of well over $1bn. This is a more than 50% increase on 2018.\n\nIts UK productions also include the film Eurovision, starring Will Ferrell, Pierce Brosnan and Rachel McAdams, and the TV series Dracula, a co-production with the BBC from the creators of Sherlock.\n\nLast year, the number of subscribers to streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime overtook those signed up to pay-TV providers including Sky, BT and Virgin Media for the first time.", "description": "Streaming service reveals 2019 budget for more than 50 projects as it battles new rivals", "authors": ["Mark Sweney"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f386bd54ba4808cb44b4f7de01d317169b2886d4/363_440_8275_4966/master/8275.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c0b6556b104d13e6baac6ee1100e4bd", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
