In the last four years he has made 65 such sculptures in the capital as part of his Troncomorto (\u201cdead trunk\u201d) project, documenting his creations on his Instagram account.\n\nGandini chose to carve faces because he believes they help elicit empathy and respect from passersby towards the tree stumps. \u201cThey respect the tree is also an individual,\u201d he says. He tries to imagine what kind of face the tree would have if it was a person: \u201cI try to find a face that\u2019s right for that particular tree.\u201d\n\nA lack of upkeep means the city\u2019s streets have many diseased trees. \u201cThere was a big gap of five to 10 years where the trees were not taken care of properly,\u201d says Gandini. \u201cSo there are a lot of ill trees that have to be cut down because no one took care of them. The city now has a lot of tree stumps.\u201d\n\nNot everyone appreciates his work, however. Recently he says he was about to start carving a stump near the Colosseum when police stopped him, citing a new law that is tackling illegal street trading outside tourist sights. They threatened to ban him from the area for a year if they catch him there again. Nevertheless, he is undeterred: \u201cThey\u2019re dead trees, so they\u2019re not the property of the city. I have the moral right to do it.\u201d\n\nGandini has created a map on his website with the locations of the sculptures. Tour guides have started to include them on street art tours.\n\nGuardian Cities brings together the best in urban photography on Instagram at @guardiancities.
