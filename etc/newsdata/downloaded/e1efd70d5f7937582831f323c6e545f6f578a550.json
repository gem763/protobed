Son Heung-min opened South Korea's goal spree 10 minutes into the match and later netted a penalty, while Kim Shin-wook scored a whopping four goals and Hwang Hee-chan and Kwon Chang-hoon added one each.\n\nSouth Korea on Thursday crushed Sri Lanka 8-0 in a match in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province in the second round of Asian qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.\n\nThursday's victory puts South Korea at the top of its group, which includes Lebanon, Turkmenistan and North Korea, with two wins and 10 goals, followed by North Korea with two wins and three goals.\n\nNext up for South Korea is an inter-Korean match at Kim Il-sung Stadium in Pyongyang next week. The venue there is made of artificial turf -- a surface that is unfamiliar to most professional footballers, who usually play on natural grass fields.\n\nBut head coach Paulo Bento said, \"It won't be much of a problem. Some rather worry about how the atmosphere will be in Pyongyang. But I won't bring a single player if he would mind visiting the North,\" he added.", "description": "S.Korea Crushes Sri Lanka 8-0 in World Cup Qualifier", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/11/2019101100950_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
