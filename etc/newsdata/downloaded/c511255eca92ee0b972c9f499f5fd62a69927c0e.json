Photo: Valerie Plame for Congress\n\nValerie Plame isn\u2019t a spy anymore, but she plays one in her latest campaign ad, which looks more like the trailer for a movie about Jason Bourne\u2019s aunt than the start of a congressional run.\n\nThe ad, which is reportedly annoying CIA agents who think she\u2019s trivializing their work, begins with Plame reminding voters why her name rings a bell. In 2003, her career as a spy was upended by people within the Bush administration. After her then-husband, diplomat Joe Wilson, wrote a New York Times op-ed criticizing President Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, conservative columnist Robert Novak outed her as a spy.\n\nIn 2007, Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, Scooter Libby, was convicted of lying to the FBI for his role in the Plame affair. And last year, President Trump added Libby to the list of right-wing celebrities to receive a presidential pardon. In her ad, Plame seems to take issue with that. \u201cMr. President,\u201d she says into the camera, \u201cI\u2019ve got a few scores to settle.\u201d\n\nAnother notable moment comes 30 seconds in, when Plame says, \u201cI come from Ukrainian Jewish immigrants.\u201d In 2017, she was accused of anti-Semitism after she shared an article on Twitter with the headline \u201cAmerica\u2019s Jews Are Driving America\u2019s Wars.\u201d She defended sharing the piece in subsequent tweets, writing that the article was \u201cvery provocative, but thoughtful. Many neocon hawks ARE Jewish.\u201d Within a couple hours, she\u2019d apologized. \u201cOK folks, look, I messed up,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nPlame is one of a handful of Democrats running in the crowded primary in New Mexico\u2019s Third District, a seat currently held by Representative Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, who is running for Senate. Plame moved to Sante Fe in 2007 and quickly became part of the city\u2019s charity circuit, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican. Her visibility and name recognition are expected to help in the primary, but one Albuquerque pollster told the New Mexican that she\u2019ll have to grow her base \u201camong Hispanics and Native Americans.\u201d\n\nOne thing Plame has going for her at this point is money. As of the last FEC deadline, she had outraised everyone else in the race with just over $236,000. Among those donating to her were Naomi Watts, who played Plame in Fair Game, the 2010 movie based on her life.", "description": "Outed as a CIA agent in 2003, Valerie Plame is now hoping to return to public service with a Congressional bid in New Mexico.", "authors": ["Adam K.
