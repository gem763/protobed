The subpoena was initially filed late last month.\n\nAttorneys for Vance and Trump met Thursday with a clerk for U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero, the Bill Clinton-appointee assigned the case, to go over logistics in the new lawsuit. There, they agreed to a rapid-fire briefing schedule that will culminate with oral arguments Wednesday morning.\n\nIn the meantime, Vance consented to stay enforcement and compliance with the subpoena until after next week\u2019s court hearing.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the constitutional issues at stake in this case will receive the appropriate review from the District Court,\u201d said Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow.\n\nThe Trump lawsuit opens by arguing that \u201cvirtually all legal commenters agree\u201d a sitting president can\u2019t be subject to a criminal process while in office. \u201cYet a county prosecutor in New York, for what appears to be the first time in our nation\u2019s history, is attempting to do just that,\u201d the president\u2019s lawyers argue, naming both Vance and Trump accounting firm Mazars as defendants.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to declare the Vance subpoena unconstitutional. But they did allow that Trump might later face off against the New York prosecutor when the president is no longer in the White House.\n\n\u201cThis court should declare it invalid and enjoin its enforcement until the President is no longer in office,\u201d they wrote.\n\nVance spokesman Danny Frost earlier Thursday acknowledged in a statement receiving Trump\u2019s lawsuit and said the district attorney \u201cwill respond as appropriate in court.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Trump himself was implicated in Cohen's crimes, which prosecutors have said were centered around payments made to silence several women in the heat of the presidential election.\n\nTrump's newest lawsuit is now one of many swirling around the issue of his tax returns.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal has a case in court seeking Trump\u2019s federal tax returns, though it is still in its early stages. A district court judge rejected Democrats\u2019 bid to fast-track the case, and Trump is now countering with a motion to dismiss the suit.\n\nA separate suit in which Trump is suing Neal to prevent him from tapping a New York law to obtain his state returns has bogged down in a jurisdictional dispute over whether the case ought to be heard in Washington, D.C., or in New York City.\n\nBrian Faler contributed to this report.", "description": "The lawsuit is a response to a subpoena the New York District Attorney filed last month seeking eight years of Trump's personal and corporate tax returns.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/d3/f5bc11bf4415b5ef341c0bd4f9e0/190917-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
