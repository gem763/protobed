Has the terrorist threat increased or decreased?\" moderator Elaine Quijano asked.\n\n\u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways, because bin Laden is dead,\u201d he responded. \u201cThe terrorist threat has decreased in some ways because an Iranian nuclear weapons program has been stopped. The terrorist threat to United States troops has been decreased in some ways because there's not 175,000 in a dangerous part of the world. There's only 15,000.\n\n\u201cBut there are other parts of the world that are challenging. Let me tell you this: To beat terrorism, there's only one candidate who can do it, and it's Hillary Clinton. Remember, Hillary Clinton was the senator from New York on 9/11. She was there at the World Trade Center when they were still searching for victims and survivors. That's seared onto her, the need to beat terrorism.\n\n\u201cAnd she's got a plan to do it. She was part of the national security team that wiped out bin Laden. Here's her plan to defeat ISIL. First, we've got to keep taking out their leaders on the battlefield. She was part of the team that got bin Laden, and she'll lead the team that will get Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of ISIS.\u201d\n\nKaine responded to the news by thanking all those involved in the operation...except President Trump.\n\n\"We owe immense thanks to our special forces, Kurdish allies, and all who supported the operation that killed ISIS leader al-Baghdadi,\" he tweeted.", "description": ".10/29/2019 9:50:29AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/211/cb1a577e-f337-401b-a5be-f040246aa7a5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
