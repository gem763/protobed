Less than one-third, 27 per cent, of the increase will be due to natural population growth (more births than deaths).\n\nThe government statistics agency made that immigration prediction based on the average annual net long-term international migration of 190,000. That figure is derived from the average immigration figures from mid-1993 to mid-2018. In terms of gross immigration, 5.4 million people are expected to immigrate long-term to the UK in the ten years to mid-2028.\n\nThe ONS also predicts that the population will pass the 70 million mark by mid-2031.\n\nHowever, The Times noted that the 70 million mark could be hit far sooner. Based on a higher projection offered by the ONS, where net migration runs at around 290,000 a year, that level could be reached in the next eight or nine years.\n\nThat figure is not far off the total net migration for the year to September 2018, in data the ONS revealed in February. In that preceding 12-month period, net migration \u2014 gross immigration minus emigration \u2014 was at 283,000. Total immigration for that period was 627,000 people, while 345,000 people left the UK (emigrated).\n\nIn one London borough, the figure hit 75 per cent https://t.co/vmZSdg9aE1 \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) August 24, 2018\n\nCommenting on the release, Migration Watch UK\u2019s chairman, Alp Mehmet, said in a press release: \u2018This is a staggering projection. What the ONS is saying is that, if the level of net migration remains at about the average of the past five years, the population will rise to 71 million within 15 years, or another five million people.\n\n\u201cIn such a scenario, more than 90 per cent of the increase would be due to the impacts of new immigrants and the children they then go on to have in the UK.\u201d\n\nMr Mehmet added: \u201cLooking further ahead, if net migration continues at that level then by the time a child born this year reaches his or her 18th birthday there would be another 6.3 million people. This will mean further unbearable pressure on housing, transport, schools, university places. The impact now is huge, but it will be even greater on the next generation.\n\n\u201cThis underlines how crucial it is for post-Brexit border reforms to deliver a significant reduction in the level of net arrivals. No wonder 30 million people \u2014 3 in 5 UK adults \u2014 wish to see this happen.\u201d\n\nFertility Falls in EU, Not ONE Country Hits Population Replacement Level https://t.co/C0ASzuOBms \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 14, 2019\n\nLondon is also set to hit a milestone within a decade, according to predictions published in April, with the population projected to hit 10 million by 2029. Again, international migration is set to be the driving factor, with an estimated 172,000 foreigners arriving in the capital each year.\n\nMigration Watch UK analysed government statistics and in a report published in August 2018, suggested that 82 per cent of all population growth since the beginning of the 21st century has been due to the impact of migration.\n\nBreitbart London reported in August 2019 that the birth rate in England and Wales had fallen to its lowest level since records began in 1938 \u2014 meaning that the current birth rate is even smaller than during the war years, when the country was robbed of its young men who were fighting on the fronts in Europe, Africa, and Asia.", "description": "By mid-2028, the population of the UK is set to increase by three million to 69.4 million, primarily driven by immigration.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/12/Crowded-London.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
