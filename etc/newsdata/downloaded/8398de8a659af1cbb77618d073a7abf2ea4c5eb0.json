News and The Blast, the picture agency has stated they are the owner, and hold exclusive copyright for the photo in question, and didn\u2019t give her permission to post it.\n\n\u2018Plaintiff never licensed the Photograph to defendant. Nevertheless, Lopez used it without authorisation or permission from plaintiff to do so,\u2019 E! reported the documents state.\n\n\u2018Specifically, Lopez or someone acting on her behalf copied the Photograph and distributed it on Instagram, via the @jlo account, on a story posted November 7, 2017.\n\nSplash claimed J Lo was notified of her infringement \u2018through her representatives,\u2019 by a letter from 12 December, 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The Photograph is creative, distinctive, and valuable,\u2019 they argued. \u2018Because of the subject\u2019s celebrity status, and the Photograph\u2019s quality and visual appeal, plaintiff (and the photographer it represents) stood to gain revenue from licensing the Photograph.\n\n\u2018But defendant\u2019s unauthorised use harms the existing and future market for the original Photograph.\n\n\u2018The Instagram post made the Photograph immediately available to Lopez\u2019s tens of millions followers and others, consumers of entertainment news\u2014and especially news and images of Lopez herself, as evidenced by their status as followers of her\u2014who would otherwise be interested in viewing licensed versions of the Photograph in the magazines and newspapers that are plaintiff\u2019s customers.\u2019\n\nKim Kardashian took matters into her own hands recently (Picture: Reuters)\n\nAs well as the $150,000 sum, Splash is also seeking to get an injunction on Jen and her team, in a bid to make sure they don\u2019t post the picture in the future.\n\nThe Jenny From The Block singer isn\u2019t the only famous face to be hit with huge legal bills after posting pap photos of themselves.\n\nGigi Hadid recently complained about being \u2018legally pursued\u2019 for uploading one snap, showing her on the street outside an event, with her millions of followers.\n\nWhile Kim Kardashian took matters into her own hands, and decided to hire her own photographer to photograph her, after fan accounts had been shut down for using copyrighted pictures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTaking to Twitter, she wrote: \u2018Btw since the paparazzi agencies won\u2019t allow the fans to repost, all of my pics are taken by my own photog and you guys can always repost whatever you want.\n\n\u2018If I ever post from an agency I will tag them and I have permission. So those please don\u2019t repost!\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted Jennifer\u2019s reps and Splash for a comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
