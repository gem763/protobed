He could end up disabled.\"\n\nAnd professional powerlifter Kirill Sychev agreed, stating: \"You can see it in his face, there is something unhealthy about it.\n\n\"This is a person, who needs complex medical help. Not just to drain his arms and detox his blood, but also psychiatric help.\"", "description": "The video has emerged after Kiril Tereshin was beaten inside three minutes in an embarrassing MMA fight", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "\u0414\u043d\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0425\u0430\u0447\u0430 Youtube", "Youtube"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20724616.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/21_Screen-Shot-2019-10-25-at-164347.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
