We know there will be compromises, but we will be looking at this deal in minute detail with a view to supporting it, but until we see that text, we can't say.\"\n\nAnalysis: Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent\n\nConservative Brexiteers want to believe Boris Johnson - they trust him, but they have not seen the legal text of a deal, so they are not saying definitively \"yes, we will vote for it.\"\n\nThe most important players are the DUP. We think they are seeing the PM again tonight and those conversations could be crucial.\n\nIf the DUP fall in behind him then it seems that Boris Johnson would have the numbers to get a deal over the line.\n\nBut if they don't, it is very hard to see how he could do it.\n\nBoris Johnson faces another deadline on Saturday - the date set out in the so-called Benn Act, which was passed last month by MPs seeking to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nIf MPs have not approved a deal - or voted for leaving the EU without one - by Saturday, then Mr Johnson must send a letter to the EU requesting an extension to 31 January 2020.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman has confirmed the government will table a motion for Parliament to sit this Saturday from 09:00 to 14:00 BST.\n\nThat motion would be considered on Thursday.\n\nHowever, this does not mean the House of Commons will definitely sit on Saturday - the government could table the motion but not push it to a vote.\n\nAnd the picture in Brussels\n\nThe expectation on the EU side is that a new Brexit deal text is pretty much ready.\n\nThey are now just waiting to hear from the UK side whether it can be signed off.\n\nEven if this text is ready, though, even if it can be signed off by EU leaders, the EU will not yet be breathing a sigh of relief because they have been here before.\n\nTheresa May signed a Brexit deal with the EU and it went on to be rejected multiple times by House of Commons.\n\nThe fear is, if a new Brexit text meets the same fate, the government will come back to Brussels asking for more concessions.", "description": "UK and EU officials are continuing technical talks, but there is no sign of a breakthrough ahead of Thursday's summit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14AEC/production/_109261748_boris_afp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
