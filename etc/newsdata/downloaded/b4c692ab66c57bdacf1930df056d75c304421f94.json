U.S. stocks SPX, +1.03% were higher early Wednesday as optimism rose again about prospects for a U.S. China trade deal.\n\nBut Powell\u2019s comments have sparked a debate among market watchers as to whether the move by the Fed is another form of stimulus, or \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d (QE) rather than the quotidian actions of a central bank attempting to keep the plumbing of the financial system operating smoothly.\n\n\u201cI think what the Fed Chairman decides to call it is inconsequential,\u201d Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist for U.S. institutional equities told MarketWatch. \u201cFrom what\u2019s been discussed, it\u2019s exactly what was once called QE. They would be buying securities and increasing liquidity and that is easing. However you want to refer to it, ultimately it\u2019s supportive of equities,\u201d he said.\n\nMike O\u2019Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading said in an interview that balance-sheet expansion may be different because it will involve the purchasing of short-term government debt rather than long-term debt, but that the effect is to enable private banks to maintain larger balance sheets and take on more risk. \u201cThis is very QE-like,\u201d he said.\n\nIn August Fed officials stopped allowing their balance sheet to shrink as U.S. Treasury securities on their books matured, but banks have been running down their reserves as they bought new debt being issued by the U.S. Treasury to fund the federal government\u2019s nearly $1 trillion budget deficit.\n\nReserves dropped to less than $1.4 trillion last month, from $2.8 trillion in 2014, when the Fed stopped buying assets. As a result the lack of liquidity in short term money markets caused overnight interest rates to spike well above the interbank fed funds rate last month.\n\nThe Fed now wants to provide enough bank reserves so the central bank can control its policy federal-funds rate and other short-term lending rates without the regular market intervention it has undertaken over the past three weeks.\n\nPowell emphasized that the Fed is contemplating buying short term debt only as a result, rather than the longer maturity debt bought after the financial crisis.\n\nPart of the debate centers on what \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d management of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet looks like. Those who see the Fed\u2019s announcement as unremarkable point to the fact that during the five years prior to the financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet grew at a steady 4% annual clip, on average.\n\nBut after years of large-scale bond buying in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, reverting to that same level of growth on a percentage basis necessarily means the Fed will be a much more active buyer of government debt, perhaps to the tune of about $10 billion per month.\n\n\u201cThe problem the Fed has is convincing markets this isn\u2019t a QE4, designed to drive long rates lower,\u201d wrote Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, in a research note. \u201cPowell pleaded [Tuesday] that this balance sheet management should \u2018in no way be confused with\u2019 large-scale asset purchases. But it\u2019s hard to communicate that effectively when the Fed\u2019s organic balance sheet growth will be half the size of the European Central Bank\u2019s newly unveiled QE.\u201d\n\nIn other words, with a Fed balance sheet that has apparently been permanently increased relative to the size of the economy, the central bank\u2019s role in financial markets has also been permanently increased. Some analysts worry that this new outsized role for central banks have made markets complacent.\n\nTorsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities warned in a Tuesday note to clients that stock market performance is \u201cno longer being driven by economic fundamentals, but instead by [the Federal Reserve] and [European Central Bank\u2019s] promises of lower rates, more dovish forward guidance.\u201d\n\nAlec Young, managing director of global market research at FTSE Russell, however, argued that economic and corporate fundamentals will always, eventually, matter. \u201cThe Fed is in important backstop for the market, but it\u2019s not a panacea,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cFed easing can soften the blow from trade-driven global slowdown, but it can\u2019t completely reverse it.\u201d\n\nSee also: Powell says economic expansion can last, but there are risks", "description": "The Federal Reserve Chairman\u2019s announcement Tuesday has led to a debate over what should be considered \u201cnormal\u201d monetary policy.", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS963_powell_ZG_20191009115629.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
