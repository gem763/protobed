(Alex Trautwig/Getty Images)\n\nAlex Bregman unleashed his swagger in the last three games of the World Series against the Washington Nationals \u2014 and now he\u2019s drawing the ire of two ex-MLB stars.\n\nBregman homered in the first inning of Game 6 against the Nats to give the Astros a 2-1 lead in this possible World Series-clincher. That\u2019s not the reason he immediately was getting criticized on Twitter, though.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBregman also carried his bat all the way with him to first base, which the unwritten rules will tell you is a big no-no. Watch:\n\nWhy flip your bat when you can take it with you?\n\n\n\n(Via @MLB) pic.twitter.com/qqhNFGOOnh \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 30, 2019\n\nHere\u2019s a slowed-down version of Bregman trying to hand his bat to Astros first-base coach Don Kelly, which he actually botched:\n\nWe\u2019ve seen MLB\u2019s \u201cWe Play Loud\u201d commercial about 10,000 times this postseason. Bregman is one of the stars. He\u2019s one of the most interesting young players in the game \u2014 the possible AL MVP and always sharp with a clever quip.\n\nAs much as MLB is trying to get fans (and even some players) to ditch some of the old-school unwritten rules mentality that would get Bregman thrown at in his next at-bat, it\u2019s obvious some long-time baseball people are clinging to tradition.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this case, Bregman was called out specifically by two players who have had their own big moments in October \u2014 ex-Red Sox and Indians star Mike Napoli and ex-Giants and Nationals slugger Michael Morse.\n\nBregman is a douche!!! \u2014 Mike Napoli (@MikeNapoli25) October 30, 2019\n\nBregman ... dude taking the bat all the way to first....that\u2019s asking to get someone hurt on your team ... next year . Right now focuses on winning #WorldSeries \u2014 Michael Morse (@MorseBeWithU) October 30, 2019\n\nMorse, it\u2019s worth noting, had his career ended after he sustained a concussion during the Bryce Harper-Hunter Strickland a few years back between the Nats and Giants, who Morse played for at that point. That brawl was because Harper admired an October homer a little too long for Strickland\u2019s liking and Harper paid for it a couple of years later.\n\nBregman might not get his unwritten-rules punishment for this right away, not in Game 6 of the World Series, but it might come one day.\n\nAs for an immediate response, Nats star Juan Soto showed himself to be a master of the retort. He homered fifth inning to give the Nats a 3-2 lead. It was a monster shot. And he carried his bat to first base with him \u2014 just like Bregman.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
