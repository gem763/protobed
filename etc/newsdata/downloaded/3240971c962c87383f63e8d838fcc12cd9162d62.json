Four of the six biggest Nordic banks had expected the move, but most other forecasters didn\u2019t.\n\nThe krone rose as much as 0.5% against the euro but pared most of those gains as Norges Bank signaled it was unlikely to deliver more tightening for now.\n\n\u201cThe executive board\u2019s current assessment of the outlook and balance of risks suggests that the policy rate will most likely remain at this level in the coming period,\u201d Governor Oystein Olsen said in a statement.\n\nDubbed by local economists as one of the \u201clast hawks,\u201d Norges Bank has stood out for its commitment to tightening as both the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve deliver more stimulus. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday pointed to the fallout of a global trade war as something that should give monetary policy makers pause.\n\nOlsen presented Norway\u2019s rate decision on a day full of central bank announcements. Moments earlier, the Swiss National Bank had kept its main rate at a record low of minus 0.75%, following a cut by the Fed late on Wednesday.\n\nNorway\u2019s decision shows that \u201cthe rate path is marginally lower from June and signals that Norges Bank is basically done hiking rates,\u201d said Joachim Bernhardsen, an analyst at Nordea in Oslo, said in a note to clients. \u201cHowever, they maintain a small hiking bias indicating that a hike is more likely than a cut next year.\u201d\n\nThe Norwegian economy has so far proved resilient. That\u2019s allowed the government, which is backed by the world\u2019s largest sovereign-wealth fund, to provide the kind of stimulus that most other European nations can only dream of. Norway will spend the equivalent of almost 8% of GDP this year to plug a budget shortfall. Against that backdrop, unemployment has stayed below 4% and inflation is above target.\n\nOlsen has avoided unconventional policies, such as negative rates and asset purchases, and instead opted for a strategy he calls \u201cleaning against the wind\u201d to fight financial imbalances. Recent gains in the price of oil and a persistently weak Norwegian krone underpin the central bank\u2019s commitment to tightening.\n\n(Adds economist comment.)", "description": "Norway Delivers Rate Hike Most Economists Weren't Expecting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic6a497c954c40fbe7bd3f69996e3135a0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
