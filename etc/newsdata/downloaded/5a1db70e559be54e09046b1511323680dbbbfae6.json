Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump has an unfortunate habit of openly soliciting crimes. Sometimes it\u2019s bribery, sometimes it\u2019s violence, and sometimes it\u2019s foreign collusion in American elections. Occasionally, the president\u2019s overtness puts congressional Republicans in an awkward position. So, when they\u2019re asked to respond to these statements, they\u2019ve come up with a standard line: He\u2019s kidding.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Trump doesn\u2019t get the joke. He keeps making clear that he\u2019s serious.\n\nOn July 26, 2016, based on a high-confidence assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies, the New York Times reported that embarrassing emails about Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, released by WikiLeaks, had been hacked by the Russian government. The next day, at a press conference in Florida, Trump invited Russia to do more hacking. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens.\u201d\n\nRepublicans laughed off Trump\u2019s suggestion as a \u201cjoke.\u201d But Trump didn\u2019t. When journalists questioned whether he was serious, he stood his ground. \u201cDo you have any pause about asking a foreign government\u2014Russia, China, anybody\u2014to interfere, to hack into the system of anybody in this country?\u201d a reporter asked the candidate. Trump stared back, straight-faced, and affirmed that on reflection, he saw nothing wrong with the idea. \u201cNo, it gives me no pause,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean, to be honest with you, I\u2019d love to see them.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, on Oct. 18, 2018, Trump spoke at a Republican campaign rally in Montana. He praised Rep. Greg Gianforte, who had pleaded guilty to assaulting a reporter in 2017 for asking a question about health care. (According to a Fox News correspondent who witnessed the attack, Gianforte grabbed the reporter by the neck, slammed him to the ground, and punched him. The reporter had to go to the hospital.) At the rally, Trump mimicked the assault and told the crowd, \u201cAny guy that can do a body slam, he\u2019s my kind of\u2014he\u2019s my guy.\u201d\n\nAgain, Republicans shrugged off the remark. Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Republican whip, said Trump was just \u201cribbing\u201d Gianforte. Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska suggested that the president was being \u201cplayful.\u201d Eric Trump said his dad was just having \u201cfun.\u201d But video of the rally showed Trump warming to the idea and arguing that, on reflection, Gianforte\u2019s attack was politically helpful and morally blameless. At one point, Trump glanced off camera at somebody who seemed embarrassed by Trump\u2019s endorsement of the body slam. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about,\u201d said the president.\n\nThe next day, at a signing ceremony in Arizona, Trump was given an opportunity to disown the remark, or at least to make clear that it was facetious. A journalist asked him, \u201cDo you regret bringing up, last night at your rally, the assault on a reporter by a congressman?\u201d Again, Trump stared back without a trace of irony. \u201cNo. Not at all,\u201d he replied. \u201cGreg is a tremendous person. And he\u2019s a tough cookie. And I\u2019ll stay with that.\u201d\n\nLast week, Trump solicited another violation of the law. On Oct. 3, in an exchange at the White House, a reporter asked him why he had urged the president of Ukraine, in a phone call, to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump defended his request, repeating that Ukraine \u201cshould investigate the Bidens.\u201d Then, unprompted, he segued to a completely different country. \u201cAnd, by the way,\u201d he said, \u201clikewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAgain, Republicans brushed off Trump\u2019s proposal as a prank. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said the president was \u201cjust needling the press,\u201d not making \u201ca real request.\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Trump was trying \u201cto bait the press,\u201d not being \u201cserious.\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Trump was just \u201cgetting the press all spun up,\u201d not genuinely suggesting that China should \u201cgo investigate the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAgain, Republicans brushed off Trump\u2019s proposal as a prank.\n\nThese characterizations don\u2019t square with video of the exchange. Trump\u2019s demeanor was dead earnest. When a reporter followed up to see whether he was serious\u2014\u201cHave you asked President Xi to investigate?\u201d\u2014the president replied, again without a trace of irony: \u201cI haven\u2019t, but it\u2019s certainly something we can start thinking about. Because I\u2019m sure that President Xi does not like being under that kind of scrutiny, where billions of dollars is taken out his country by a guy that just got kicked out of the Navy.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Trump was given a second chance to say that his request to China was a joke. Again, he spurned the opportunity. A reporter asked him, \u201cWere you joking when you asked China to investigate the Bidens?\u201d \u201cChina has to do whatever they want,\u201d Trump replied without any change of expression. \u201cIf China wants to look into something, I think that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t want to, I think that\u2019s great too.\u201d On Friday, Trump again suggested that China should look into the family. \u201cChina can do whatever they want,\u201d the president told reporters, \u201cwith respect to one and a half billion dollars\u201d that was supposedly (but not actually) entrusted to Biden\u2019s son.\n\nTrump sometimes pretends, after the fact, that he was joking. That\u2019s what he did in 2018, when special counsel Robert Mueller asked about the July 2016 press conference in which Trump invited Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails. Trump told Mueller that video of the press conference showed his request was \u201cin jest.\u201d But Russian operatives, watching the video, concluded that it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWithin five hours of Trump\u2019s remark,\u201d says Mueller\u2019s report, \u201ca Russian intelligence service began targeting email accounts associated with Hillary Clinton for possible hacks.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Trump thinks all of this is fun. He loves the idea of foreign countries targeting his opponents. He thinks beating up reporters is hilarious. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s joking. It just means he\u2019s twisted. And Republicans like Rubio, who shrug off the president\u2019s outbursts, aren\u2019t more clever or sophisticated than the rest of us. They\u2019re just cowards.", "description": "Republicans say he\u2019s kidding when he openly solicits crimes.
