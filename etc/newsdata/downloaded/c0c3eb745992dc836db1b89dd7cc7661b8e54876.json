It turned up 14 years later behind her house.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nPlurna the stuffed cat was found behind the Bauers' Virginia home this week, 14 years after their 4-year-old daughter lost her. (Susan Wise Bauer)\n\nThe story of Plurna the stuffed cat was legend in the Bauer family.\n\nEmily Bauer was 4 when she lost her favorite stuffed animal. She sobbed for weeks as the family tore apart the house, dug up the sandbox where Plurna was allegedly left \u2014 and even searched under their old farmhouse in Charles City, Va.\n\nPlurna was gone. But the story of the lost cat, Emily\u2019s heartbreak and the massive search undertaken by the Bauers \u2014 with their three older sons \u2014 was often retold at family gatherings. It was even recounted with dramatic flair last weekend, 14 years after Plurna disappeared, when the Bauers visited friends on the West Coast.\n\nThen, on Tuesday, Plurna appeared.\n\nThe cat was covered in dirt and vines, and moss was growing across the body, but she was generally intact. A worker on the 100-acre farm where the Bauers live spotted her in the woods as he was putting up a fence for the goats, and he brought her to the house.\n\n\u201cI was so gobsmacked I could not believe my eyes that he was holding Plurna,\u201d said Susan Wise Bauer, 51, who led the unsuccessful search party for the stuffed cat all those years ago.\n\n\n\nEmily Bauer at her fourth birthday, the same year she lost her favorite stuffed animal, Plurna. (Susan Wise Bauer)\n\nBauer immediately took Plurna to the home office of her husband, Peter Bauer, and held up the dirt-caked toy.\n\n\u201cHis eyes got to be the size of plates and he said, \u2018We have to go show her!\u201d Bauer said.\n\nThey marched the stuffed animal to Emily\u2019s room, and when she looked up she couldn\u2019t talk.\n\n\u201cEmily squeaked,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t even get words out.\u201d\n\nBut Plurna was dirty. So Emily, who recently graduated from high school and is taking a year off before college, spent hours with a tweezer pulling roots and moss off Plurna\u2019s fur. She gently washed the cat, and put her in the dryer on gentle cycle.\n\n\u201cShe still kind of smells like dirt, but she\u2019s in surprisingly good shape,\u201d said Emily.\n\n\n\nEmily Bauer, 18, with Plurna on Tuesday. (Susan Wise Bauer)\n\nStill in shock that the beloved stuffed animal was found in one piece, Bauer took to social media, where she has a following as an author of books about education, and also as the owner of a bed-and-breakfast on the family farm.\n\nTo her surprise, total strangers by the thousands seemed as excited as she was that Plurna was found. People posted their own stories of favorite stuffed animals that were lost and then found again, or just lost for good and still bring back a sad memory.\n\nIt's not a miracle--I don't want to overstate this story--but all of our jaws are hanging open. Fourteen years ago,... Posted by Susan Wise Bauer on Tuesday, September 24, 2019\n\n\u201cIt really hit a note,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cI love that people are posting pictures of their own stuffed animals, and writing what they thought Plurna was up to in the woods all those years. Most of them are strangers. It gave them hope in some way.\u201d\n\nFourteen years ago, my four-year-old daughter lost her dearest stuffed animal friend ever. Plurna was gone. We all wept. For months.\n\n\n\nToday, my farm manager found Plurna in the woods wrapped in roots.\n\n\n\nWe washed her and she is whole.\n\n\n\nI am speechless. pic.twitter.com/LhEaGKpKFs \u2014 Susan Wise Bauer (@SusanWiseBauer) September 24, 2019\n\nIt did the same for Bauer. It\u2019s been a tough year with her husband facing a serious illness and her parents, who are in their 80s, also having health challenges.\n\n\u201cOK, Universe,\u201d she wrote on Facebook. \u201cThanks for the lift.
