Bolton clears the stage for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2014 along with Vice President Mike Pence, one of the few members of Mr. Trump\u2019s original national security inner circle still standing \u2014 to wield more influence over a raft of foreign policy challenges confronting the White House.\n\nWhile Mr. Pompeo was publicly aligned with the ousted national security adviser\u2019s notoriously hard-line positions on several fronts, in particular on Iran, the two sharply disagreed in private on a range of other matters, most notably the pursuit of sensitive nuclear negotiations with North Korea.\n\nNational security sources said Tuesday that Mr. Bolton\u2019s departure could open the way for renewed \u201cworking level\u201d talks and a possible step-by-step approach with North Korea \u2014 an approach the State Department was once seen to advocate only to be shut down by Mr. Bolton\u2019s demand that Pyongyang accept an all-or-nothing deal.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only area where the two men disagreed. Mr. Pompeo\u2019s background as a tea-party-backed star in the House of Representatives has made him more adept at working personally with Mr. Trump, particularly when it comes to threading the policy needle implementing the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy impulses.\n\nBut the secretary of state\u2019s influence was challenged when Mr. Bolton, an entirely different kind of foreign policy conservative, joined the administration\u2019s inner circle in April 2018.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s neoconservative bent \u2014 favoring U.S. military intervention and regime change as go-to policy options \u2014 initially added heft to the administration\u2019s pressure campaigns against Iran and North Korea. But it also soon clashed with Mr. Trump\u2019s desires to withdraw U.S. forces from undesired conflict zones and to persuade foreign nations to take more responsibility for global security, even if it means pressuring allies to pay more for their own defense.\n\nMr. Pompeo cultivated a close relationship with Mr. Trump after being named head of the CIA, giving Mr. Trump personal intelligence briefings. One sign of his continuing clout: One of the first names floated as a permanent replacement for Mr. Bolton was Stephen E. Biegun, the secretary of state\u2019s envoy to talks with North Korea and a close political ally.\n\nThe secretary of state has not always meshed perfectly with his boss, including Mr. Trump\u2019s surprise recognition of Israeli control of the Golan Heights and the president\u2019s cut of foreign aid programs to Central American nations.\n\nBut Mr. Pompeo\u2019s personal rapport with Mr. Trump, his willingness to defend the administration in the media and his determined campaign never to show daylight between himself and the president on major issues are likely to take on new significance with Mr. Bolton gone.\n\nMr. Pompeo made no secret Tuesday of the fact that he and Mr. Bolton crossed swords on policy over the past year.\n\n\u201cThere were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed; that\u2019s to be sure,\u201d the secretary of state told reporters. \u201cBut that\u2019s true for lots of people with whom I interact.\u201d\n\nHe said separately that Mr. Trump \u201cshould have people that he trusts and values and whose efforts and judgments benefit him in delivering American foreign policy.\u201d\n\nThe fall of Mr. Bolton and rise of Mr. Pompeo could play out quickly when world leaders gather for the annual U.N. General Assembly in New York this month. While the State Department has energetically implemented Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against Iran after the withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal, Mr. Pompeo has been careful to leave room for Mr. Trump\u2019s expressed wish for a possible personal diplomatic overture along the lines of his North Korea policy.\n\nAsked Tuesday whether there could be a precedent-shattering meeting between Mr. Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. gathering, Mr. Pompeo said simply, \u201cSure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has made very clear he is prepared to meet [Iranian leaders] with no preconditions\u201d in search of a better deal to curb Tehran, Mr. Pompeo said.\n\nOne Republican insider told The Associated Press that Mr. Bolton\u2019s opposition to such a meeting was a precipitating factor in his dismissal.\n\nSome Republicans appeared to openly cheer Mr. Bolton\u2019s dismissal. Sen. Rand Paul, Kentucky Republican and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters that Mr. Trump has long been clear that \u201che\u2019s not for regime change.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said that [on] North Korea, he\u2019s actually said that [on] Iran, and you know, Bolton\u2019s been very, very loud in his call for regime change around the world,\u201d Mr. Paul said. \u201cI think the problem is that it\u2019s a naive point of view to believe that we can militarily topple regimes around the world and that they\u2019ll be replaced with democracies.\u201d\n\nRep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who serves on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN that Mr. Trump and Mr. Bolton were like \u201coil and water,\u201d while the president\u2019s \u201crelationship with Secretary Pompeo is quite strong.\u201d\n\nNorth Korea diplomacy could feel an immediate shift with Mr. Pompeo\u2019s rising clout. Mr. Bolton infuriated Pyongyang and stunned others in the administration when he said the U.S. was looking for a \u201cLibya-style\u201d model for the North Koreans \u2014 even though Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi lost his power and then his life after agreeing to give up his nuclear programs in a deal with the George W. Bush administration.\n\nMr. Bolton\u2019s departure could open the way for more low-key, lower-level contacts between Washington and Pyongyang to better lay the groundwork for the next Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\u201cBolton\u2019s exit may lead to a more realistic, step-by-step approach to North Korean denuclearization, where Bolton\u2019s \u2018all or nothing\u2019 approach to easing sanctions has produced a deadlock despite three Trump-Kim summits,\u201d said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia and South Korea and a former NATO deputy secretary general.\n\n\u201cBolton\u2019s departure was only a matter of time,\u201d Mr. Vershbow, a fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, said in comments circulated to reporters. \u201cStill, the timing is ironic, coming after Trump\u2019s termination of negotiations with the Taliban on which Bolton was right to be skeptical (maybe Trump didn\u2019t like hearing \u2018I told you so\u2019).\u201d\n\nMr. Pompeo has also apparently been spared the occasional dressing-down that former Trump aides say are a regular feature of working in this administration.\n\n\u201cI argue with everyone,\u201d Mr. Trump told New York Magazine in a 2018 interview. \u201cExcept Pompeo. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had an argument with Pompeo.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
