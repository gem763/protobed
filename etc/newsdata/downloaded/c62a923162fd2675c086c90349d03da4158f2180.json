I was convinced my finger was gone and my mum had to reassure me it was still there.\n\n\u2018I have to remind myself that I\u2019m living in the present and that the flashback is my brain playing tricks on me.\u2019\n\nMel has been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a condition which can cause victims of traumatic events to experience disturbing flashbacks \u2013 and she has revealed that everyday life feels like a \u2018battlefield\u2019 for her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Even though you have left your abuser, there is a whole new way of trying to find yourself and trying to deal with your emotions and PTSD or whatever mental illness you have,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018I still wake up with night sweats. I know he\u2019s not there but I still have flashbacks and that\u2019s ongoing.\u2019\n\nMel and Stephen were married for a decade between 2007-2017 (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nSince splitting from her ex-husband, Mel has moved back to her hometown of Leeds to live with her mother and two eldest daughters from her previous relationships to dancer Jimmy Gulzar and Eddie Murphy respectively \u2013 20-year-old Phoenix and 12-year-old Angel \u2013 and she admits that living with her family has \u2018kept her feet on the ground\u2019.\n\nHowever, Mel does not live with her only daughter to Stephen, eight-year-old Madison, who currently lives with her dad amid an ongoing custody battle.\n\nThe 44-year-old explained that she hasn\u2019t seen her daughter \u2018in over nine weeks\u2019, and that the US courts do not recognise her situation as she is a UK citizen.\n\n\u2018I used to sleep with her [Madison] every night and now all I have is a FaceTime court order which my ex changed the number on, so for nine weeks I\u2019ve been calling the wrong number,\u2019 she explained. \u2018Every day I wake up with anxiety thinking, \u201cCan I speak to Madison today?\u201d\n\n\u2018I now have to go through a custody evaluation, which is more time I have to sit in the same room as my ex and breathe same air as him and still leave it to a judge and jury to decide whether my 70% custody can stay in place because I\u2019ve relocated.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMel had first met Stephen in February 2007, with the two tying the knot that June.\n\nHowever, the TV talent judge previously claimed that the film producer abused her on their wedding night, and continued to subject her to both physical and emotional abuse for a decade.\n\nIn December 2016, the couple separated, with Mel filing for divorce from Stephen in March 2017. The divorce was finalised that December.\n\nMel has since become a patron for the charity Women\u2019s Aid, which helps to end domestic violence against women and children.\n\nNeed support?
