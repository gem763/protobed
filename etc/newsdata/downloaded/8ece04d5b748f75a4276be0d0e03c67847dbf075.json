The number of quarterly reports balloons to over 880 this week, of which more than a few will be S&P 500 constituents as well as members of the Dow 30.\n\nHere are some of the key reports that we'll be watching each day:\n\nMonday, Oct. 28: AT&T (T) , Check Point Software (CHKP) , Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) , Akamai (AKAM) , Alphabet (GOOGL) , Beyond Meat (BYND) , NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) , T-Mobile USA (TMUS) .\n\nTuesday, Oct. 29: AutoNation (AN) , Corning (GLW) , Eaton (ETN) , GrubHub (GRUB) , Kellogg (K) , Mastercard (MA) , Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) , Electronic Arts (EA) , FireEye (FEYE) , Apple (AAPL) .\n\nWednesday, Oct. 30: Molson Coors Brewing (TAP) , Sony (SNE) , Facebook (FB) , Habit Restaurants (HABT) , Lyft (LYFT) , Starbucks (SBUX) , Universal Display (OLED) .\n\nThursday, Oct. 31: AMC Networks (AMCX) , Estee Lauder (EL) , Global Payments (GPN) , Ingredion (INGR) , Parker-Hannifin (PH) , Xylem (XYL) , Qorvo (QRVO) .\n\nFriday, Nov. 1: Colgate-Palmolive (CL) , MoneyGram (MGI) , U.S. Steel (X) .\n\nAfter this week, more than half of the S&P 500 constituents will have reported September-quarter results, which means we expect EPS forecasts to be refined. Current forecasts call for September-quarter earnings to fall more than 4% year over year and December-quarter earnings to rise by more than 2% on that same basis. Market watchers will be analyzing these refinements to see if 2019 S&P 500 EPS estimates still call for growth of 1.4% year over year. As those adjustments come in, we suspect we will also see some fine tuning to 2020 S&P 500 EPS estimates. Currently the consensus is calling for EPS growth of 10.3% in 2020.\n\nFed\n\nAmid the earnings wave, the Fed's next FOMC meeting concludes this Wednesday. Right now, the market sees a more than 93% chance the Fed will once again cut interest rates. Should that not come to pass, the current earnings season has given us more than several examples of what happens when the market's expectations aren't met.\n\nRest up for a busy week!\n\nThis commentary is an excerpt from the Trifecta Stocks Roundup, a weekly feature sent to subscribers of Trifecta Stocks.
