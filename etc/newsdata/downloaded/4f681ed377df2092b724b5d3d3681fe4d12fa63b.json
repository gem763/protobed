She just assumed that one of us was going to do that,\" Semenza said. \"She was my inspiration, and I think that is the importance of teachers, to serve as that kind of spark.\"\n\nKaelin, a scientist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said in a telephone interview that he awoke to the 5 am phone call from Stockholm, wondering at first if it was a dream.\n\n\"My heart was racing in disbelief,\" Kaelin said.\n\nRatcliffe, director of clinical research at the Francis Crick Institute in London, was writing a grant proposal when he received the call.\n\nThe work began in the 1990s, when Semenza identified genes that turned on when oxygen levels were low to increase levels of erythropoietin (EPO), a protein that increases the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. (This is the same basic mechanism behind doping, in which endurance athletes try to increase their supply of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.) An anaemia drug was recently approved in China that increases red blood cells by targeting this basic mechanism.\n\nThe scientists worked separately to understand this mechanism in cells, but they talked and occasionally shared unpublished data - sometimes at a scientific meeting, sometimes at the bar, Kaelin said.\n\nSemenza's scientific paper describing the protein that responds to low oxygen has now been cited thousands of times, but he recalled that it was rejected from numerous top journals - a reminder that science builds on itself over time, and blockbuster discoveries that transform understanding are not instantly apparent, even to other scientists.\n\n\"We submitted to these so-called top tier journals, they didn't find it to be of sufficient interest to warrant publication,\" Semenza said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, some of the most exciting applications of the research are in cancer. The cells at the centre of a tumour are able to thrive in an oxygen-deprived environment, far from blood vessels that carry nourishing oxygen.\n\nTraditional chemotherapy or radiation treatments mostly kill the tumour cells on the periphery, not the ones at the centre that have adapted to a low-oxygen environment, said Qing Zhang, a scientist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who previously worked in Kaelin's laboratory. Those hardy cells that survive can metastasize to seed new cancers, one of the biggest challenges facing patients and oncologists.\n\n\"The basic question is how the cancer cells can survive the lack-of-oxygen condition, and how what doesn't kill them can make them stronger,\" Zhang said.\n\nRandall Johnson, a member of the Nobel Committee, compared the molecular machinery the scientists discovered to a switch that ensures that the body always has the right level of oxygen.\n\n\"The prize is for this . . . rheostat or thermostat of the oxygen levels - a damper that you'd have on your furnace to let in more or less oxygen at any given time so that it's just right, so that the flame burns just right,\" Johnson said.\n\nAlthough it has become clear that this line of research has medical applications, Kaelin said that the prize underscores the importance of doing research to follow curiosity and unravel basic biology. He and the other scientists hoped, but did not know, that unraveling how cells sense oxygen could spark ideas for new approaches for human diseases, including stroke and cancer. Kaelin and Semenza both received funding from the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"This kind of research is increasingly under threat. It's much easier for fundraisers and policymakers to say we will support scientists, but . . . tell us how it will improve outcomes in five years,\" Kaelin said. \"When you're doing real science, you have to be prepared to take the road where it takes you - and if you're doing science, it's hard to predict where the road is going to take you.\"\n\nThe three scientists will split the award, worth about $900,000, equally.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "The discoveries by the trio illuminated what the Nobel Committee called \"one of life's most essential adaptive processes\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3306%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_68%2C$y_1/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4569dc21d3e0310c1ca45ca9b747b27a945f62e5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
