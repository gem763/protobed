If the train leaves before the arrival message finishes, then the \u201cstep back, doors closing\u201d warning message won\u2019t play, Metro spokesman Dan Stessel said. Operators have been told to keep doors open until the warning can play.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe safety commission announced Friday on Twitter that it \u201chas requested a formal investigative report of this issue and looks forward to reviewing and providing more information soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe [safety commission] encourages riders to report any safety issues if encountered,\u201d the agency tweeted. \u201cReports can be made at the safety concerns portal on WMSC\u2019s website: wmsc.gov.\u201d\n\nHello @Metrorailinfo SV to Largo 7679 no doors closing chime or announcements. #WMATA pic.twitter.com/Dp9wtZsjBi \u2014 Brian in Arlington (@cosmova78) July 15, 2019\n\nHey @Metrorailinfo exact same thing yesterday and today: doors closing w/ no chime or announcement. Car 7005 today. #WMATA pic.twitter.com/50QDgJ5XPx \u2014 Brian in Arlington (@cosmova78) July 16, 2019\n\nThe recorded warnings are a federal requirement listed in the Americans With Disabilities Act, which states that \u201cauditory and visual warning signals shall be provided to alert passengers of closing doors.\u201d\n\nStessel said rail car engineers and technicians conducted a fleetwide inspection of 7000-series cars this week and found no glitches. But when they recreated a combination of conditions, they found that the rail cars\u2019 audible messaging system can play only one informational message at a time.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhile relatively uncommon, this appears to happen when the announcement sequence exceeds the station dwell time,\u201d Stessel said in a statement. Metro is \u201cinstructing train operators to wait for the announcements to end before initiating a door-close command.\u201d\n\nThe transit authority is revising the warning announcements for 7000 series trains to make them \u201cshorter and clearer,\u201d Stessel said, and it\u2019s working on a software fix to ensure the door-closing announcement always goes off before a train leaves a platform.\n\nMore than half of Metro\u2019s working fleet consists of 7000-series cars, officials told lawmakers Tuesday during a \u201cstate-of-the-system\u201d hearing on Capitol Hill.\n\nAD\n\nMetro\u2019s fleet is made up of several series of rail cars, purchased at different points over the years, including a 37-year-old series still in service. In May, Metro took its 3000-series trains out of commission after a video surfaced showing a car\u2019s door open while the train was in motion. An initial review revealed an electrical-component malfunction, and Metro said the part or similar components found on 26 cars would be replaced.\n\nA report on that investigation is scheduled to be released soon by the safety commission.\n\nIn 2015, Metro\u2019s 4000-series cars had to be pulled from service for door problems. The series had other safety concerns and has since been retired.\n\nAD", "description": "The Washington Metrorail Safety Commission is investigating social media reports and video footage of doors on 7000-series rail cars closing without the required automated warnings for passengers.", "authors": ["Justin George", "Transportation Reporter Focusing On National Transit", "Metro", "The D.C.-Area Public Transportation System"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8YTq50yqZ6Ee-fgS_ItAycHcjWs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D2JRQSWS7MI6TCJEDW35VR4X7M.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
