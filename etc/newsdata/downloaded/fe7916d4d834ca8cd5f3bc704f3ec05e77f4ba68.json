Ed Markey has backing from much of the Massachusetts Democratic establishment.\n\nBOSTON, Mass. \u2014 The first days of Joe Kennedy\u2019s Senate primary campaign offer a glimpse at the coalition he hopes to assemble in his challenge to Sen. Ed Markey, a blockbuster contest that could reorder Massachusetts\u2019 congressional delegation.\n\nAfter launching with a breakfast Saturday in East Boston, where the Kennedy family traces back to a neighborhood populated by Irish immigrants in the mid- to late-1800s, he\u2019ll embark on a three-day statewide tour that begins Saturday. The roughly 15-stop trip is largely focused on immigration, affordable housing and the opioid crisis. He\u2019ll meet with LGBTQ asylum seekers and refugees in Worcester, and talk about climate change and union jobs in New Bedford. In Boston, he\u2019ll tour an affordable housing development.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that focuses less on winning over activists and establishment leaders, and more on turning out new voters \u2014 particularly immigrants and people of color \u2014 who typically vote at lower rates than white voters do. It\u2019s a model that worked spectacularly here for Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley in her insurgent 2018 House campaign against another fixture of the state political establishment, then-Rep. Michael Capuano.\n\nBut there are important differences between Pressley and Kennedy: Kennedy starts with a politically golden name, a slightly larger war chest and, just as important, a lead over the incumbent in the polls.\n\n\"People still care about the Kennedy name. It's a very, very powerful legacy,\" said Scott Ferson, founder of Liberty Square Group, a strategic communications firm. \"It will be used to his advantage and people will try to use it against him, but Congressman Kennedy in his race in 2012 navigated that very nimbly.\"\n\nAs he campaigns for the first time outside his Boston-area House district, Kennedy will have to help his famous name take a form in voters' minds, said political strategist Michael Goldman. Goldman grew up in Malden with Markey, and consulted for Kennedy's father, Rep. Joseph Kennedy II.\n\n\"[Kennedy] has to be able to convince people that he understands the problems of people like them, even though he's young, that he cares about the problems of people like them \u2026 and most importantly, he has to convince people that when he gets to Washington he can do more for Massachusetts than Ed Markey,\" Goldman said. \"Ed Markey has to convince people that the time he spent in Washington for the last 43 years puts him in the best position to understand the problems of people like them, care about them and also to deliver for them.\"\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

He has the backing of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, support from many of his colleagues in the Senate and has rolled out endorsements from environmental groups for weeks.\n\nHe also has the endorsement of New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which could help bolster him against calls for generational change.\n\n\u201cSenator Markey is an effective fighter for Massachusetts and a strong progressive leader in the caucus on issues ranging from tackling climate change to ending gun violence. The campaign\u2019s broad and diverse coalition of supporters reflects his record of delivering for Massachusetts in the Senate, and we\u2019re proud to support his re-election,\" said DSCC spokesperson Stewart Boss.\n\nThe Markey-Kennedy match-up is likely to be one of the most-watched primary races in the country. Kennedy holds a 14-percentage-point lead over Markey in a head-to-head contest, according to a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll. He'll start the race with $4.2 million in his House campaign account, while Markey has $4.1 million.\n\nWhile some Democrats caution that the race could take attention away from beating President Donald Trump, strategist and former DSCC political director Martha McKenna says the party will stay focused on knocking out Republicans.\n\n\u201cSeptember of 2020, donors and activists are going to have a lot of things on their to-do lists and I think above the Massachusetts primary will be beating Donald Trump and beating Thom Tillis and beating Cory Gardner and beating Susan Collins,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI don't think there's any evidence that Democrats can be distracted right now.\"\n\nThe most important thing for Massachusetts, McKenna said, is that the primary winner head into the general election without being too bruised, though she does not expect a race between Kennedy and Markey to turn ugly.\n\n\u201cWe have a Republican governor there and we have a Republican senator in the not-too-distant past. The key is that the Democratic primary winner has to emerge unscathed because we have evidence Republicans can win statewide in Massachusetts given the right situation.\"\n\nBefore Pressley toppled Capuano, Rep. Seth Moulton was the first Massachusetts Democrat in recent history to knock out an established incumbent. A number of strategists and advisers who worked with Moulton disagree with the main criticism that Kennedy has faced \u2014 that a Senate primary will distract Democrats from getting President Donald Trump out of the White House.\n\n\"It's hard for any Senate race to overshadow the race for the White House,\" said Mark Mellman, a veteran pollster and strategist who has worked with Moulton. \"There is a real battle for control of the Senate and the Massachusetts primary is just not part of that battle.\u201d\n\nInstead, former members of the Moulton campaign argue that the debate that comes along with a Democratic primary can be a boon for the party.\n\n\"I don't see the argument for avoiding a primary and having a real discussion about what the future looks like, different ideas about how to address it and both of them making their case either on experience or it being a time for new blood,\" said Joe Trippi, who worked for the late Sen. Ted Kennedy and was part of Moulton's 2014 campaign. \u201cI think it's a healthy thing to have a debate and a primary that gets people a choice and makes the case.\u201d\n\nCriticism aside, Kennedy's task will be to prove why he'd be a better representative than Markey. That pitch must come down to more than an argument about age or generation, says Ferson, who advised Moulton in 2014.\n\n\"I think he's got to draw a contrast other than a generational contrast,\" Ferson said. \"Seth Moulton didn't beat John Tierney because he was damaged goods. Seth consciously made the case that John Tierney only passed one bill in 18 years in Congress.\"\n\n\"Here, you can't make that case against Ed Markey,\" Ferson continued, pointing to Markey's record in congress and his advocacy on climate change. \"You have got to make people sit up and say 'Now that's a reason to switch.'\"", "description": "Sen.
