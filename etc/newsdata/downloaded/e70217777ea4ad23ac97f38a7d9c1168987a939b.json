It is so tragic and not the first time it's happened outside a US base.'\n\nAnother local said: 'It's unbelievable, the idea that top intelligence officers can't remember which side to drive on.'\n\nThe car which crashed into Harry was allegedly driven by the wife of a US diplomat, Anne Sacoolas and police said they had CCTV footage of her driving on the wrong side of the road.\n\nAfter the crash, she returned to the US and claimed diplomatic immunity meaning she cannot be prosecuted in the UK.\n\nBut tonight, in a letter to Harry's parents Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said she does not have this right since leaving the country.\n\nThe car which crashed into Harry (left) was allegedly driven by the wife of a US diplomat, Anne Sacoolas (right)\n\nIn the letter seen by Sky, Mr Raab says: 'The UK government's position is that immunity, and therefore any question of waiver, is no longer relevant in Mrs Sacoolas' case, because she has returned home.\n\n'The US have now informed us that they too consider that immunity is no longer pertinent.\n\n'In these circumstances, Harry's case is now a matter for Northants police and the CPS to take forward.'\n\nThe 'excellent news' according to Mr Dunn comes at the same time as legal discussions have opened between the two parties.\n\nThe 19-year-old victim's parents, Charlotte Charles (pictured) and Tim Dunn, have now decided to take their fight to the US\n\nSpokesman Radd Seiger (centre) said he has had a brief phone conversation with Sacoolas's lawyers\n\nA lawyer representing Sacoolas has made contact with representative of the family Radd Seiger, a former lawyer and family friend.\n\nHe told ITV News: 'I have just landed on a flight from London and had a very brief phone conversation with the legal team representing Anne Sacoolas.\n\n'We have agreed to meet each other at the earliest possibility as soon as we can co-ordinate our diaries.'\n\nIt is understood to be the first contact between the two parties since Sacoolas left the UK after she was granted diplomatic immunity following the crash.\n\nIt raises hopes that a major row between the US and UK governments could be avoided.", "description": "The markings have appeared by the RAF Croughton base in Northamptonshire where Harry Dunn was knocked down on his motorbike in August by a driver on the wrong side of the road.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/01/19640278-0-image-a-23_1570924988507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
