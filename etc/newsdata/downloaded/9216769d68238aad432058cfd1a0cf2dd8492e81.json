After listing off just a few of the factual errors Biden has made over the past few weeks, it soon became clear he was setting the candidate up for a joke.\n\n\u201cLook, the reason I came on the Jimmy Kimmel show\u2026\u201d Biden said to cheers from the audience and a laugh from Colbert.\n\nAsked if it\u2019s \u201cfair\u201d to criticize his gaffes, Biden said, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to go after a political figure for anything.\u201d But he went on to defend himself by adding, \u201cAny gaffes that I\u2019ve made, and I\u2019ve made gaffes like every politician I know has, have been not about the substantive issue.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the controversial Afghanistan story specifically, Biden said, \u201cI was not talking about me, I was praising the valor of all these people out there that I\u2019ve visited, over 20 visits in Afghanistan and Iraq, and I\u2019ve watched these people and I\u2019ve watched what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nEssentially, he argued it\u2019s more about the sentiment than the details. Colbert agreed that this type of \u201cempathy\u201d is something \u201cwe sorely need right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, it\u2019s a different thing to say, when you\u2019re talking about honoring bravery or the sacrifice or what other people went through and the essence of it is absolutely true,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe fact that I said I was vice president\u2014well, in one case I was vice president-elect in the other I was a senator. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s relevant.\u201d\n\nThen came the pivot to Trump: \u201cBut I don\u2019t get wrong things like we should lock kids up in cages at the border.\u201d", "description": "The 2020 candidate told the \u201cLate Night\u201d host that if he has the \u201cessence\u201d of his anecdotes right, the details are not \u201crelevant.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_35/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567645505/115621_0407_yrx35u"}
