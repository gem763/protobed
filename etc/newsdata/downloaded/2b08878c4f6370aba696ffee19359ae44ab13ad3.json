In January, the museum announced the discovery of five more frogs, including two females, and in light of their gloomy prospects in the wild, they were brought back to the aquarium. Romeo finally has his Juliet, and a shot at fatherhood.\n\nEach spring, the common frogs in my urban backyard pump out prodigious amounts of spawn seemingly at the drop of a hat, so I naively supposed that the course of Romeo\u2019s romance would now run smooth and looked forward to news of tadpoles. But no: A little reading revealed that captive frogs aren\u2019t always so obliging. What floats one frog\u2019s boat leaves another unmoved\u2014and the rarer the species, the less chance of discovering what gets it in the mood. So, what to do if rarities like Romeo and Juliet don\u2019t or won\u2019t do what\u2019s needed to save their species?\n\nRead: The last of its kind\n\nFor some frogs and toads, reproductive technologies could be the answer. Advances in the rapidly evolving fields of amphibian hormone therapy, artificial fertilization, and cryopreservation are beginning to improve the odds of tiny captive populations producing healthy tadpoles. So far, the number of threatened species benefiting from these technologies is small, but as the Australian reproductive biologist Aimee Silla of the University of Wollongong told me, the lessons being learned are paving the way to help many more. \u201cThese technologies have a lot of potential,\u201d says Silla, who reported on the field\u2019s mounting achievements with her colleague Phillip Byrne in the Annual Review of Animal Biosciences. \u201cAnd there are exciting breakthroughs all the time, so we have reason to be optimistic.\u201d\n\nEarth\u2019s biodiversity is shrinking at unprecedented speed and amphibians are on the front line, losing a greater proportion of species than any other vertebrate group. In 2017, the International Union for Conservation of Nature listed some 2,100 amphibians as at imminent risk of extinction\u2014almost 32 percent of all the species known\u2014and it estimates the figure could be as high as 55 percent.\n\nBehind the losses are the usual suspects\u2014disappearing habitat, changing climate, pollution, and overexploitation for food and the exotic animal trade\u2014but with the addition of the worst wildlife disease ever documented, chytridiomycosis. A recent assessment of this catastrophic fungal disease concludes that it has led to the decline of at least 500 amphibian species and the extinction of at least 90.\n\nRead: The worst disease ever recorded\n\nHerpetologists began sounding the alarm in the late 1980s, and their fears prompted the first global assessment of frogs and toads and their kin. The results, published in 2004, were shocking. Populations everywhere were plummeting; some species had vanished. The following year, international experts held a summit to hash out an action plan, and one key recommendation was that zoos, aquariums, and other organizations with suitable facilities should \u201crescue\u201d the species closest to extinction and breed them in captivity.", "description": "Amphibians are dying off faster than any other vertebrate group in the world.
