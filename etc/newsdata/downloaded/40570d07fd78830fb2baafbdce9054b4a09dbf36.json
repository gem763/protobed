Usually they get into lakes and reservoirs after extreme participation events and when they are in the lake, warmer temperatures exacerbate algal blooms.\n\n\u201cClimate change means extreme weather events are increasing which increases runoff of these chemicals.\u201d\n\nThere were very few lakes in which algal bloom improved, researchers found. The lakes that did were ones that warmed the least which suggests global warming counteracts management efforts to improve water quality.\n\n\u201cWe found that the peak intensity of summertime algal blooms increased in more than two-thirds of lakes but decreased in a statistically significant way in only six of the lakes,\u201d said co-author Anna Michalak from Carnegie Institution for Science.\n\n\u201cThis means that algal blooms really are getting more widespread and more intense, and it\u2019s not just that we are paying more attention to them now than we were decades ago.\u201d\n\nStudies suggest they cost $4bn each year in the US alone. A sharp rise in algae populations have led to swimming bans from lakes in the Pacific Northwest to the entire Mississippi seacoast and Lake Hopatcong, New Jersey\u2019s largest lake.\n\nIn May this year a sudden surge in algae killed at least eight million salmon in one week across Norwegian fish farms. The algae stuck to fishes\u2019 gills and suffocated them.\n\nThe Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries said that more than 10,000 tonnes of farmed salmon, with a sales price of some 620 million Norwegian crowns (\u00a356m), had been killed\n\nSimilar algal blooms were reported on the west coast of Scotland. killing thousands of fish in Loch Fyne with hundreds of tonnes of dead fish removed following the bloom.", "description": "Toxic algal blooms which can be fatal to humans,\u00a0are increasing across the world as temperatures rise, according to the first global survey of dozens of freshwater lakes based on 30 years of Nasa data.\u00a0 The increase\u00a0is being driven\u00a0by climate change, run off from chemicals used in\u00a0agriculture and urban development, according to the research published in the journal\u00a0Nature.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/17/algal-bloom-joshua-stevens.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
