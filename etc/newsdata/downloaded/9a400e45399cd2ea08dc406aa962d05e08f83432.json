He turned and waved goodbye to cornerback Byron Jones before he crossed the goal line. We can talk about whether that was the most sportsmanlike act, but nobody was hurt. If that was a big deal to you, you\u2019re wound way too tight.\n\nAnd the NFL still fined Jones more than $10,000 for waving goodbye at an opponent. Let\u2019s repeat that: They took $10,000 from a player for ... waving.\n\nPackers\u2019 Aaron Jones gets a fine for waving\n\nThe exact fine was $10,527, according to ESPN.com\u2019s Rob Demovsky. That\u2019s pretty ridiculous.\n\n\u201cI can't say it's worth it, but it's a dope picture,\u201d Jones told Demovsky. \u201cI'm going to have that blown up.\u201d\n\nAt least he can keep his humor about having to give over $10,527 for practically nothing. Jones told Demovsky he wasn\u2019t fined for throwing another touchdown ball to his brother in the stands. Quite kind of the NFL. We\u2019ve become so accustomed to large player salaries and the long list of ridiculous NFL fines every week that it just goes unnoticed that these fines are a ton of money.\n\nHopefully Jones goes on to a long career and makes millions of dollars. But as we\u2019ve heard time and again, running back careers can be short. There are probably some good things Jones could have done with that $10,527 the NFL took from him over nothing.\n\nGreen Bay Packers running back Aaron Jones was fined more than $10,000 for this wave.
