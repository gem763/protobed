Typically the actor\u2019s kind eyes and stunning smile are the things that win him a role. No other face could spill a drink on a movie star outside his bookstore in Notting Hill and wind up married to her by the end of the movie. But his good looks were the only things keeping him from playing Professor Bhaer in the now-iconic 1994 Little Women, according to the New York Times oral history of the project. The casting director, Carrie Frazier, and producer Denise Di Novi explained what attracted them to the actor and why his beauty was a curse.\n\nIn Louisa May Alcott\u2019s book, Professor Bhaer is a German expat, living and teaching in the United States to help support his orphaned nephews. Boring and \u201cnot handsome\u201d (Alcott\u2019s words!), it\u2019s a 151-year-old mystery why Jo March ends up marrying him. But if Hugh Grant were playing him, well, the answer would be all over his face. \u201cWe all had a huge crush on Hugh,\u201d said Di Novi, who is also an executive producer on Greta Gerwig\u2019s upcoming adaptation. \u201cHe sent in a self-tape, and he was actually quite good.\u201d But Frazier thought they had \u201cgone off the rails.\u201d \u201cIt was so important to us to be true to the book in terms of Professor Bhaer\u2019s age and what he was like,\u201d Di Novi explained. \u201cHugh was too stunningly beautiful.\u201d John Turturro also \u201clobbied very hard for that role,\u201d but Gabriel Byrne won out. Sorry, Hugh Grant, go be hot elsewhere! Actually, why don\u2019t you come be hot over here?\n\nThis post originally misstated the actor who played Professor Bhaer.", "description": "Hugh Grant was almost cast in Gillian Armstrong\u2019s 1994 \u201cLittle Women\u201d adaptation, but there was one little problem: He\u2019s too beautiful.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/12-hugh-grant.w1200.h630.jpg"}
