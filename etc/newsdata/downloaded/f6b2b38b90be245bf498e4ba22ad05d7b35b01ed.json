Germany and others are actually GETTING PAID to borrow money,\" Trump tweeted. \"Fed was way too fast to raise, and way too slow to cut!\"\n\nThe timing: Trump's tweet comes less than a week before the Fed's policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) holds a two-day meeting in Washington next Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe background: Trump's Thursday tweet is his latest demand for the Fed to implement levels of stimulus not seen since the 2008 recession.\n\nWhile the U.S. economy has slowed throughout 2019, Trump is asking the Fed to mirror efforts used by Europe to reverse an economic retraction across the continent.\n\nTrump's appeal to swing voters is deeply dependent on the strength of the U.S. economy, which is his most compelling pitch to Americans, including those otherwise uncomfortable with his agenda.\n\nThe president is also depending on victories in trade talks with China and Europe to fulfill campaign pledges to voters in industrial states, such as Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, crucial to a winning coalition in 2020.\n\nWhat's next: The FOMC is widely expected to cut its baseline interest rate range by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive meeting. The cuts come after the Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 over the protests of Trump, who now insists that the bank should zero-out borrowing costs entirely.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nWaPo: White House delayed Ukraine trade decision amid aid hold-up: White House officials delayed a trade agreement with Ukraine in late August, around the same time President Trump was withholding security aid to the country, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.\n\nThe decision came after then-National Security Adviser John Bolton John BoltonImpeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report Trump's new challenge is officials dishing dirt Former Nunes staffer fueled Trump's Ukrainian corruption claims: report MORE warned Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer Robert (Bob) Emmet LighthizerPelosi sounds hopeful on new NAFTA deal despite tensions with White House On The Money: Economy adds 164K jobs in July | Trump signs two-year budget deal, but border showdown looms | US, EU strike deal on beef exports Chinese, US negotiators fine-tuning details of trade agreement: report MORE that President Trump would likely oppose any assistance to Kiev, the Post reported. Around the same time, the administration was withholding nearly $400 million in aid to the country.\n\nThe decision suggests the Trump administration's actions toward Ukraine went beyond holding up the security-related aid. Trump is under scrutiny over allegations that he delayed the funds as he sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenImpeachment inquiry might be public by mid-November: report The Memo: GOP schisms deepen as Trump impeachment pressure rises Graham nixes plan to send Pelosi letter warning GOP won't convict Trump MORE, a 2020 presidential contender.\n\nPence accuses NBA of 'acting like a wholly owned subsidiary' of China: Vice President Pence on Thursday hammered the NBA and Nike for their handling of the controversy surrounding a Houston Rockets executive's tweet supporting Hong Kong protesters, accusing the companies of ignoring human rights abuses in China.\n\n\"Some of the NBA's biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\" Pence said in remarks in Washington on the U.S.-China relationship.\n\n\"In siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,\" he added, calling it \"un-American\" for U.S. companies to \"embrace censorship.\"\n\nThe vice president also blasted Nike, accusing it of hypocrisy in promoting itself as a \"social justice champion.\" He cited reports that Nike stores in China removed Houston Rockets merchandise following General Manager Daryl Morey's support of Hong Kong protesters.\n\n\"When it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,\" Pence said of Nike.\n\nThe kicker: Pence's speech was originally planned for June but was delayed several times as the White House sought a tariff truce with China in efforts to forge a broader trade deal.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\nChina intends to buy at least $20 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products if it signs a partial trade deal with Washington and would consider boosting the purchases further in future rounds of talks, according to a Bloomberg report...\n\n...but a wave of Chinese nationalism could be bad news for U.S. brands.\n\nODDS AND ENDS", "description": "Happy Thursday and welcome back to On The Money.
