This is despite the fact that Mike Johnson, a fan favorite suitor with a megawatt smile, was also among the finalists for the gig, which would\u2019ve made him the first black Bachelor in the show\u2019s history. (Rachel Lindsey served as the first black Bachelorette two years ago.) Taking some time to reflect after Weber\u2019s announcement was made official, Johnson is now admitting that he feels the gig should\u2019ve indeed gone to him, which, obvi. \u201cAfter 24 Bachelors, a black Bachelor should have been cast,\u201d Johnson told Entertainment Tonight in a new interview. \u201cBut at the same time, ABC has been successful. They know what they\u2019re doing for their audience. They know what they\u2019re looking for. I wasn\u2019t the guy they were looking for at the moment.\u201d\n\nJohnson says he wasn\u2019t given an exact reason by the network why Weber was chosen over him, but, of course, believes race was a strong factor. \u201cI do know that Peter and I are two completely different people \u2060\u2014 both good people, kind-hearted people. But I do feel that I\u2019m a bit more outspoken than Peter,\u201d Johnson explained. \u201cI\u2019m a bit louder than Peter is. I have tattoos, and the obvious, I\u2019m black, so we are very diverse and different in that regard as well. And we like different women. I want to make sure the focus is centered around love because that\u2019s what this show is about. Peter and I also are attracted to two different types of women.\u201d Still, Johnson seems to be doing just fine despite the snub: He confirmed that he took Devi Lovato, a noted Bachelor enthusiast, out on a date, and it went great. \u201cThe woman is quite astounding and amazing,\u201d Johnson teased, \u201cand that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say on that.\u201d", "description": "Mike Johnson, who competed on Hannah Brown\u2019s Bachelorette season, discusses why he\u2019s not the Bachelor and why Peter Weber is.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/10/11-mike.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
