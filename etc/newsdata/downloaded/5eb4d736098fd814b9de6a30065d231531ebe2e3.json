The menu can be accessed from the New Tab page.\n\nThis is an experimental feature, and users must activate it by accessing the chrome://flags section and enabling two options named \"NTP customization menu version 2\" and \"Chrome Colors menu\"\n\nchrome://flags/#ntp-customization-menu-v2\n\nchrome://flags/#chrome-colors\n\nOnce enabled, a new menu will allow users to customize their Chrome browser with new themes, control how the shortcuts on the New Tab page look, and customize the New Tab page background wallpaper.\n\nThis is a feature that has been in the works for months, and Google initially promised it would be ready for last month's release in Chrome 77. It wasn't included last month, but it is today.\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nTab hover cards\n\nA small detail that most users will also notice in this release is the fact that when hovering a tab, Chrome will now show a small panel (tooltip) with information about that tab.\n\nCalled \"Tab Hover Cards,\" this feature was added to help Chrome power users who open a large number of tabs.\n\nThe hover card will make it easier for users with crowded browser toolbars to locate the tab they're looking for at a particular moment, instead of cycling through all at once.\n\nTo disable this feature or use a different style for the hover cards, just visit\"\n\nchrome://flags/#tab-hover-cards\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nDark Mode on every website\n\nA cool addition in Chrome 78 is a feature called Forced Dark Mode that enables a dark mode setting on every website, even if the website supports a dark theme or not.\n\nThis feature doesn't mess with websites' source code but uses color theory inversion to switch light website UIs into their chromatic dark versions.\n\nSome sites might look weird when this feature is enabled, but from our experiments, CIELAB-based inversions looked pretty good.\n\nTo enable Forced Dark Mode, you can access and enable the following Chrome flag:\n\nchrome://flags/#enable-force-dark\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nPassword Checkup tool\n\nChrome 78 is also the first Chrome version that integrates the Chrome Password Safety tool. This is a Google-developed extension that was integrated into Chrome.\n\nThe former extension allowed users to check if their passwords had been leaked in public data breaches. Now, this option is available within Chrome itself, but will only work if users are syncing Chrome-stored passwords to their Google account.\n\nWe detailed this feature in a longer piece earlier this month, which you can read here.\n\nThe Password Checkup tool is not enabled by default, but users can turn it on by visiting:\n\nchrome://flags/#password-leak-detection\n\nImage: ZDNet\n\nDNS-over-HTTPS trials\n\nChrome 78 is also the version in which Google will test the new DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) protocol inside Chrome. This protocol works by disguising DNS queries and responses inside regular HTTPS traffic.\n\nAt the start of September, Google said that it would test how DoH performs in a real field test, within the Chrome stable release.\n\nWhat users need to know is that Chrome's DoH implementation is different from Firefox. While Firefox sends all DoH requests to a Cloudflare server by default, Chrome will not modify the local computer's DNS settings.\n\nIf the user's locally-set DNS server supports DoH, Chrome will send over DoH requests. If it doesn't, Chrome will send over classic DNS requests. More on this rollout plan in this Google blog post.\n\nRemoval of XSS Auditor\n\nAnd last, but not least, in Chrome 78, Google engineers have removed the old XSS Auditor, a security feature that had been present in Chrome since v4, released in 2009.\n\nFor years, this has been Chrome's de-facto protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. However, as the XSS Auditor aged and web standards advanced, the tool became highly inefficient, and Chrome engineers decided to remove it for good over the summer.
