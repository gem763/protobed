Her team, however, said it was because of \"scheduling conflicts.\"\n\nThe announcement comes after a heated back-and-forth between Clinton and Gabbard. During a podcast interview on Friday, Clinton said Gabbard was a \"Russian asset\" who is being groomed to launch a third party campaign as a means of disrupting the 2020 election.\n\nWhen Gabbard received word of the interview, she took to Twitter to respond, saying Clinton is \"the queen of warmongers\" and the \"embodiment of corruption.\" Gabbard also explained the former Secretary of State has it out for her because her foreign policy is the opposite of Clinton's.\n\nA person close to Clinton told Slate the former Secretary of State decided to drop out after hearing Nielsen is also on the schedule.\n\n\"We work with a lot of activists who are trying to do their best to improve this horrible situation down at the border,\u201d the person said, citing Clinton's support for asylum seekers. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s an easy decision. You have to side with them.\u201d\n\nClinton's team said they told Fortune she would be unable to attend earlier in the week but it wasn't until Friday that her name and photo were removed from the website.\n\nThe former Secretary of State wasn't the only one who took issue with Nielsen's appearance. More than 52,000 people signed a petition urging Fortune to pull Nielsen off the speaker schedule.\n\n\"A celebration of powerful women should not include a woman known as the architect of baby jails,\" the petition said. \"But according to Fortune, Kirstjen Nielsen is a woman who should be celebrated and allowed to share the stage with leaders like Anita Hill and Hillary Clinton.\"\n\nEvent coordinators refused to pull Nielsen from the lineup.\n\n\u201cFortune strongly believes that interviewing Nielsen\u2014and other key figures from the private and public sector, however controversial\u2014is important journalism and provides us an opportunity to ask substantive questions in front of our viewers and readers,\u201d Fortune communications manager Alison Klooster said in a statement.\n\nClinton can try to hide behind distaste for Nielsen as her reason for backing out. Americans aren't stupid. They know the real reason she decided not to show her face: it's because she's receiving flak for calling Gabbard a Russian asset. She has people slamming her for the comments, including those on her own side, like CNN's Van Jones.\n\nShe can say she's hiding because of \"scheduling conflicts\" or her disagreements with Nielsen's immigration policy. We know the truth: she doesn't want to have to confront Gabbard in person... and she doesn't want to be asked about her statement. This is her way of sweeping things under the rug.", "description": "Oh, geez. .10/19/2019 15:03:52PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/152/a9f9bd24-5d47-4ee1-93c5-46bb3e2ffc50.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
