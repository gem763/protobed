We want to lift the overall standard, not bring everyone down to the same level.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But I can say today, that our very first Budget will immediately close the tax loopholes used by elite private schools, and use that money to improve the lives of all children.\u201d\n\nThe news was welcomed by anti-private school campaigners.\n\nHolly Rigby, from the Abolish Eton campaign, said: \u201cWe are delighted that Labour has committed to integrating all private schools into the state sector and that it will feature in the next manifesto.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cWe will dismantle systems of privilege and inequality and build a society that works for the millions and not the millionaires.\u201d\n\nBut the Independent Schools Council (ISC) warned Labour that the policy would be a \u201cvote loser\u201d.\n\nCiting a ComRes survey for the organisation, Barnaby Lenon, chair of the ISC chair and a former headmaster of Harrow, said: \u201ct\u2019s not something that people are thinking is going to be especially helpful. The main thing they want to do is improve state schools, which is what we all want.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the proportions that are less likely to vote for a party abolishing independent schools or are neutral, the figure ranges between 62 and 77 per cent across all regions and it ranges from 64 to 75 per cent across all age groups.
