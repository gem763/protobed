Israel's Arabs could lead parliamentary opposition", "language": "en", "text": "HAIFA, Israel (Reuters) - Israel\u2019s Arab parties are set to be the largest non-ruling bloc in parliament - and could even lead the opposition - if a national unity government emerges from Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Arab Israeli lawmaker Ayman Odeh speaks during a demonstration held by Israeli left-wing group Peace Now, entitled \"Two States, One Hope, A demonstration against 50 years of occupation\" , in Tel Aviv, Israel May 27, 2017. The Hebrew words read: \"Peace Now.\" REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo\n\nA surge in turnout gave the Arab-dominated Joint List 13 of the Knesset\u2019s 120 seats, making it the third-largest grouping behind Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing Likud party, with 31 seats, and Benny Gantz\u2019s centrist Blue and White, with 33.\n\nThat would make the Joint List the largest opposition grouping in parliament if a unity government takes shape, a realistic possibility even though Gantz rebuffed Netanyahu\u2019s initial invitation.\n\nNo party drawn from the 21 percent Arab minority has ever been part of an Israeli government. But if Joint List head Ayman Odeh, 44, becomes opposition leader, he would receive monthly briefings from the Mossad intelligence agency and meet visiting heads of state, among other perks.\n\nThis would provide an outlet to voice Arab complaints of discrimination against them and give a bigger platform to Arab parties that differ with those drawn from the country\u2019s Jewish majority on many political debates.\n\n\u201cIt is an interesting position, never before held by someone from the Arab population. It has a lot of influence,\u201d Odeh told reporters outside his home in Haifa, a mixed Arab and Jewish city in northern Israel.\n\nBut although the Joint List will be the single largest group, other opposition parties combined would have enough seats to block his appointment through an absolute majority vote, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the other parties will agree to have Ayman Odeh as head of the opposition, and grant our community recognition and legitimacy,\u201d said Aida Touma-Sliman, an Arab lawmaker from Odeh\u2019s Hadash faction.\n\nArab lawmakers often call for an end to Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and the dismantling of Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank.\n\n\u201cSYMBOLIC WIN\u201d\n\nThe Arab community in Israel is mainly descendants of the Palestinians who remained in Israel after its creation in 1948, and some in the younger generation openly identify as Palestinian.\n\nThey make up 1.9 million of Israel\u2019s 9 million population, and often complain of discrimination in health, education and housing, living in cities such as Nazareth and Acre in the north and Bedouin towns in the southern Negev desert.\n\nThe Mossawa Center rights group says Israel\u2019s state budget often favours Jews, allocating more funds to Jewish localities and schools than to Arab ones. Some 47% of Arab citizens live in poverty, far above a national average of 18%, it says.\n\nHowever, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party counters that its 15 billion shekel ($4.19 billion) investment plan for the Arab sector during the last parliament was \u201cthe largest such commitment in Israel\u2019s history\u201d, according to Eli Hazan, Likud\u2019s foreign affairs director.\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s election, Odeh and his group of four Arab parties ran a united front and Arab turnout increased sharply. That helped them regain seats lost in April when they were divided and turnout plummeted.\n\nThe Joint List held up its stronger showing on Tuesday\u2019s rerun as a victory over what it described as an \u201cunprecedented campaign of incitement against the Arab public\u201d by Netanyahu and right-wing parties.\n\nNetanyahu made allegations of voter fraud in Arab communities an issue in his election campaign, and sought to deploy cameras to the country\u2019s polling centres in what Arab leaders described an attempt to scare off voters. Israel\u2019s top court refused to allow cameras.\n\nEid Jbaili, a 55-year-old gym teacher from Haifa, said he boycotted the April election but voted on Tuesday \u201cbecause my community\u2019s leaders showed they could exude unity in the face of adversity\u201d.\n\nBut Jbaili was unsure an Arab opposition leader would be able to provide anything beyond a \u201csmall symbolic win\u201d for his community.\n\n\u201cWe still won\u2019t be decision-makers in this country,\u201d he said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Seat projections in Israel's election - here)", "description": "Israel's Arab parties are set to be the largest non-ruling bloc in parliament - and could even lead the opposition - if a national unity government emerges from Tuesday's election.", "authors": ["Rami Ayyub", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432052713&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1QO", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
