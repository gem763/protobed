Allowing the whistleblower to meet with congressional investigators should be next: Our view\n\nStory Highlights A U.S. president with proper respect for the powers of his office would not seek to outsource opposition research to a foreign government.\n\nA president with a proper understanding of the rule of law would not treat the nation\u2019s attorney general as just another fixer.\n\nDonald Trump is not such a president.\n\nTo hear Donald Trump and his defenders tell it, the president\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s new president were no big deal. \u201cThe single greatest witch hunt in American history ... a disgraceful thing ... a manufactured crisis,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.\n\nActually, if it\u2019s a crisis, it\u2019s one of the president\u2019s own making. As a partial transcript released by the White House confirmed, Trump pressured Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call two months ago to investigate a political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nMoreover, the memo revealed that Trump sought to involve America\u2019s top law enforcement officer, Attorney General William Barr, in a scheme to assist Ukraine in trying to dig up dirt on Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy firm.\n\nThe White House readout did not show an explicit quid pro quo between nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine and the Biden inquiry. But immediately after Zelensky mentioned defense support, Trump said, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor.\u201d\n\nA U.S. president with proper respect for the powers of his office would not seek to outsource opposition research to a foreign government. A president with a proper understanding of the rule of law would not treat the nation\u2019s attorney general as just another fixer.\n\nDonald Trump is not such a president.\n\nUnderscoring the seriousness of the allegations, for only the fourth time in America\u2019s nearly 250 year history, the House of Representatives \u2014 led by a previously reluctant Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 has started an inquiry into whether the president of the United States should be impeached.\n\nLightning strikes the White House grounds on Aug. 6, 2019.

ANDY BIGGS: Impeachment inquiry is just more Democrat-led obstruction of President Donald Trump\n\nNow that the machinery of impeachment is formally cranking up, all of the major players in Washington have a responsibility to treat the process with the gravity it deserves:\n\n\u25baThe White House. If, as Trump insists, everything was handled perfectly, the administration should have nothing to hide and should cooperate with the process. Sharing with Congress an intelligence-agency whistleblower complaint that raised an \u201curgent concern\u201d about Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings is a good step. Allowing that whistleblower to meet with congressional investigators should be next. Trump also must make Barr and personal attorney Rudy Giuliani available to explain their roles.\n\n\u25baDemocrats. As eager as some progressives are to try to run Trump out of office, Democrats have an obligation to focus their inquiry on the most serious allegations, gather the facts carefully and avoid rushing to judgment on the basis of incomplete information. In particular, they will need to learn the truth behind the Trump-ordered delay in delivering to Ukraine $391 million in Congress-approved military aid. That money was desperately needed by Kiev for munitions and communications equipment in its five-year war against Russian-backed separatists in the nation\u2019s eastern sector. Was funding withheld as a pressure tactic?\n\nIf Democrats conclude that impeachment is warranted, they must clarify for Americans how Trump\u2019s conduct disqualifies him from retaining office, and why that question shouldn\u2019t better be left to voters in November 2020. This is a heavy lift. Surveys have shownthat the majority of Americans oppose impeachment.\n\n\u25baRepublicans. So far, the president\u2019s fellow Republicans have excused and enabled all manner of behavior that they would have found intolerable if engaged in by a Democratic president, ranging from election-eve payoffs to a porn star to a declaration of \u201clove\u201d for North Korea\u2019s brutal dictator. Now they have a duty to put the nation\u2019s best interests above reflexive partisanship.\n\nIt was mildly encouraging Tuesday to see the Senate unanimously demand that the whistleblower complaint be turned over to Congress\u2019 intelligence committees. That kind of cooperative search for the truth will be what the nation needs in the difficult and divisive days ahead.\n\nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board, separate from the news staff.
