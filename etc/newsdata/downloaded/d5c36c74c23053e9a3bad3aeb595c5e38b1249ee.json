The app today is launching \u201cSkip Waiting On Hold.\u201d Just type in the company you need to talk to, and DoNotPay calls for you using tricks to get a human on the line quickly. Then it calls you back and connects you to the agent so you never have to listen to that annoying hold music.\n\nAnd in case the company tries to jerk you around or screw you over, the DoNotPay app lets you instantly share to social media a legal recording of the call to shame them.\n\nSkip Waiting On Hold comes as part of the $3 per month DoNotPay suite of services designed to save people time and money by battling bureaucracy on their behalf. It can handle DMV paperwork for you, write legal letters to scare businesses out of overcharging you and it provides a credit card that automatically cancels subscriptions when your free trial ends.\n\n\u201cI think the world would be a lot fairer place if people had someone fighting for them\u201d says DoNotPay\u2019s 22-year-old founder Joshua Browder. Indeed; $3 per month gets the iOS app\u2018s 10,000 customers unlimited access to all the features with no extra fees or commissions on money saved. \u201cIf DoNotPay takes a commission then we have an incentive to perpetuate the problems we are fighting against.\u201d\n\nBrowder comes from a family of activists. His father Bill Browder got the Magnitsky Act passed, which lets the U.S. government freeze the foreign assets and visas of human rights abusers. It\u2019s named after Bill\u2019s Russian lawyer who was murdered in Moscow after uncovering a $230 million government corruption scheme linked to President Putin\u2019s underlings.\n\n\u201cThese big companies [and governments] are getting away with a lot,\u201d Browder tells me. He hit a breaking point when frustrated with the process of appealing parking tickets. He built DoNotPay to cut through hassles designed to separate us from our money. In April it raised a $3.5 million seed round led by Felicis to develop an Android version after picking up early funding from Andreessen Horowitz. Surprisingly, the startup has never been sued.\n\nFor Skip Waiting On Hold, DoNotPay built out a database of priority and VIP customer service numbers for tons of companies. For legality, if you opt in to recording the exchanges, the app automatically plays a message informing both parties they\u2019ll be recorded. A human voice detection system hears when a real agent picks up the phone, and then rings your phone. It\u2019s like having customer service call you.\n\nNot only can DoNotPay help you get in touch about cancelling subscriptions, scoring refunds or retrieving information, it\u2019s like \u201ca body camera for customer service calls,\u201d Browder says. \u201cBefore they make a decision that rips off the customer, they\u2019ll think \u2018this could be made public and go viral and hurt our business.\u2019 \u201d For example, an airline that jacks up prices for rescheduled flights surrounding hurricanes could be shamed for profiting off of natural disasters.\n\nThe full list of DoNotPay services includes:\n\nCustomer service disputes where it contacts companies about refunds for Comcast bills, delayed flights, etc. The free trial credit card that auto-cancels subscriptions before you\u2019re actually charged Traffic and parking appeals where it generates a letter for you based on answers to questions, like if signs were too hard to read or there was a mistake on the ticket Hidden money discovery that finds refunds in your bank fees, identifies forgotten subscriptions, gets you free stuff on your birthday and more Government paperwork assistance that can help you get DMV appointments and fill out forms Skip Waiting On Hold\n\nBrowder hopes that with time, companies and governments will make all these chores easier for everyone. To avoid putting itself out of a job, DoNotPay is constantly looking for new annoyances to eliminate. \u201cI\u2019m from the U.K. America seems to be a pay-to-play society. The more money you have, the more rights you have,\u201d Browder concludes. But those rights could be restored for all by building a robot lawyer that\u2019s affordable to everyone.", "description": "DoNotPay helps you get out of parking tickets and cancel forgotten subscriptions, and now it can call you when it\u2019s your turn in a customer service phone queue.
