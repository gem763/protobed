When the Pittsburgh killer shouted \u201call Jews must die,\u201d he was merely echoing a command uttered in a different tongue by Amalek, the villain who stalked the weakest of the ancient Israelites in the desert on their way to the Promised Land.\n\nBut the Jews did not sustain their magnificent civilization because they were anti-anti-Semites. Our tradition was always renewed by people who made the choice in the face of tragedy that theirs would not be the end of the Jewish story, but the catalyst for writing a new chapter.\n\nThe long arc of Jewish history makes it clear that the only way to fight is by waging an affirmative battle for who we are. By entering the fray for our values, for our ideas, for our ancestors, for our families, and for the generations that will come after us. This is not an exhortation to embrace religion in all its strictures. It is a reminder that Judaism contains multitudes, and that those who point the finger at other Jews as a way to keep the target off their own backs \u2014 insisting that the real problem are those with their kippot or their Zionism \u2014 at once distorts our history and the fact of our peoplehood.\n\nIn these trying times, our best strategy is to build, without shame, a Judaism and a Jewish people and a Jewish state that are not only safe and resilient but also generative, humane, joyful and life-affirming. A Judaism capable of lighting a fire in every Jewish soul \u2014 and in the souls of everyone who throws in his or her lot with ours.\n\nBut the Jewish community \u2014 2 percent of America\u2019s population \u2014 cannot go at this problem alone. We have to insist that the societies of which we are a part take a stand against anti-\u00adSemitism, because any society in which it flourishes is one that is dead or dying.\n\nIn this, Pittsburgh gives me tremendous hope.\n\nAt first glance, what happened that terrible day was yet another pogrom. But unlike the countless pogroms in which the surrounding community stood by or abetted the attack, in my hometown, there was solidarity. As Wasi Mohamed, then the head of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, pointed out: \u201cNegative rhetoric against the Jewish community is poison. You know, it\u2019s poison for our democracy, it\u2019s poison for our country, and it\u2019s negative to everybody, not just that community.\u201d\n\nTheir support, in other words, \u00adwasn\u2019t a favor bestowed on us. Our neighbors understood that an attack on the Jewish community was an attack on them, too. That the entire community recited the mourner\u2019s kaddish \u2014 and that The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran the words in Hebrew on the front page \u2014 was further evidence that what was being protected by our fellow Americans, wasn\u2019t simply our right to exist. It was our right to lead unashamed, full Jewish lives. Which meant that they could do the same.", "description": "Does safety for Jews come from trying to be more like everyone else \u2014 or from embracing what makes us special?", "authors": ["Bari Weiss"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/opinion/sunday/08weiss-sub/08weiss-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
