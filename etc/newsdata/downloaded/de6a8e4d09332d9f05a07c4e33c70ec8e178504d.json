Police had to be called to the school to disperse the angry crowd.\n\nThe mother said she suspected something was amiss when her daughter did not want to go to school and complained about being sick.\n\n\u201cWhen she came from school on Thursday I could see that she was not okay. I asked what happened and she told me that she had a headache. On Friday when she came back from school, she was still tired. I thought maybe she had the flu.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, she said she had noticed that her daughter was still not her usual self and decided to ask her what was wrong. \u201cI asked what happened and that is when she started crying and told me that two boys had dragged her behind the classrooms where they undressed her and one of them raped her.\n\n\u201cShe said one of the boys pinned her to the ground and blocked her mouth so she could not scream,\u201d the mother said.\n\nThe mother said she was horrified when she examined her daughter with a relative. \u201cI was shocked and horrified.

I thought she was safe at school,\u201d said the mother.\n\nThe girl\u2019s father said: \u201cI can\u2019t understand how there is no supervision.
