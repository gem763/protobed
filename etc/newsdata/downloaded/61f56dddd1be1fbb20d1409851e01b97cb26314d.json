(CSE: RQB OTCQB: RVVQF Frankfurt: 1IT) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cRavenQuest\u201d), one of Canada\u2019s most innovative cannabis producers, announces that it has received a permit from Health Canada to allow the Company to export cannabis to Australia.\n\nThe permit allows for the export of dried cannabis flower from the Company to Medcan Australia (\u201cMedcan\u201d), a federally licensed Australian medical cannabis provider. Shipments from RavenQuest to Medcan are targeted to begin in mid-October.\n\nFounded in 2016, Medcan has a singular vision to provide Australian patients with a high-quality, fair-priced product. With a vertically integrated model, Medcan is licenced under the Office Drug Control to cultivate, produce, manufacture, export and import high quality medicinal cannabis products for both clinical trials and individual patient access throughout Australia.\n\nRavenQuest CEO, George Robinson, stated \u201cthe Australian medical cannabis model is well developed and mirrors Canada\u2019s early evolution in many respects. With a population of over 24 million residents, this is a significant market with real growth potential. The Special Access Scheme in Australia has been updated recently, making it easier to access medical cannabis. Of the 14,420 applications approved, 13,217, or 92%, occurred within the last 12 months, and 2,893, or 20%, in August 2019 alone. It\u2019s clear to us that the Australian medical cannabis market is growing very rapidly and we can now participate in this growth through our export permit with Health Canada.\u201d\n\nMedcan CEO, Craig Cochran, commented \u201cwe are very excited to begin receiving cannabis from Canada\u2019s RavenQuest. After a comprehensive facility tour through RavenQuest\u2019s ultra-modern, laboratory-grade cultivation facilities, we are confident their product easily meets our high cleanliness and safety standards. We also had in depth discussions with RavenQuest\u2019s plant science leader, Dr. Simerjeet Kaur and are very comfortable with the RavenQuest team\u2019s ability to continue our commitment to provide the safest and highest quality cannabis to our patients.\u201d\n\nFor more information, access RavenQuest\u2019s investor presentation, fact sheet and videos here .\n\nFollow RavenQuest:\n\nTwitter\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\n\nLinkedIn\n\nAbout RavenQuest BioMed Inc.\n\nRavenQuest is a diversified publicly traded cannabis company with divisions focused upon cannabis production, management services & consulting and specialized research & development.
