Her fear is that Amazon, through Sidewalk as well as other products, like its Ring doorbell cameras, is quietly creating Wi-Fi beacons everywhere. Each time our products come in contact with these devices, they transmit little bits of data. Mostly, this data isn\u2019t highly personal (occasionally, it\u2019s randomized), but it\u2019s still enough to potentially identify and then track users. Again, this already happens with Wi-Fi routers and mobile phones. The big difference here is that Amazon is looking to own a substantial chunk of the network and the devices. That means having access to a lot of data.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan suggests that the ubiquity of devices means you could be surveilled by Amazon even if you don\u2019t own its products. \u201cIf you have enough Ring doorbell cameras on your block, it doesn\u2019t matter if you bought one or not; you\u2019re being monitored and, down the road, perhaps your device is pinging them,\u201d she said.\n\nO\u2019Sullivan isn\u2019t a Luddite. And she believes that connected cities could alter citizens\u2019 lives for the better. Using big dataClose X, for example, to provide better ambulance routes could save hundreds of lives. The key, she believes, is regulation.", "description": "", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Amazon-Privacy.Html"], "top_image": ""}
