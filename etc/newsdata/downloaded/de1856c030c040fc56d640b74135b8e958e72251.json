According to Yunyoung Claire Chang, a dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology, taking the medication \u2014 which is usually administered over the course of several months \u2014 \u201cleads to reduction in oil production and shrinking of the oil glands.\u201d Many patients find that their acne never returns.\n\nBut because it\u2019s so powerful, it also comes with some unpleasant side effects. There\u2019s the potential to cause severe birth defects and changes in cholesterol and liver enzymes (which is why it\u2019s important to not get pregnant while on the medication and to have your doctor perform regular blood tests), and Accutane can also be extremely drying \u2014 which is often a new problem for acne patients. \u201cMany products that patients may be using already to treat acne can further irritate the skin,\u201d says Chang. \u201cI recommend discontinuing products that include drying or irritating ingredients, including benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, and retinoids.\u201d\n\nSince those ingredients probably make up most of the typical acne patient\u2019s skin-care arsenal, going on Accutane requires a total routine revamp. We asked Chang, and Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, what products Accutane users should stock up on.\n\nBest cleansers for Accutane users\n\nAv\u00e8ne Extremely Gentle Cleanser Lotion Both dermatologists advise Accutane users to steer clear of harsh and drying cleansers that strip the skin of its natural oils. \u201c[Look] for cleansers that are fragrance-free and hypoallergenic,\u201d says Chang, to avoid irritating the skin further. Her picks include this mild cleansing lotion from Av\u00e8ne that\u2019s free of soap and can be used without water. $24 at Dermstore Buy\n\nCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser For a more affordable drugstore staple, Chang also likes Cetaphil\u2019s basic cleanser, which is free of the most common irritating ingredients. $14 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBest facial moisturizers for Accutane users\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream \u201cIt is important to be religious with moisturizer use while on isotretinoin, reapplying multiple times per day,\u201d according to Chang. \u201cI recommend creams with ceramides, which are a key, natural lipid in the skin that helps keep moisture in the skin.\u201d As you might infer by the brand\u2019s name, CeraVe products all include ceramides to help replenish skin \u2014 which is why they\u2019re a top choice among dermatologists for Accutane users. Chang likes that this moisturizer also has other hydrating ingredients, including hyaluronic acid and glycerin. $17 at Dermstore Buy\n\nNeutrogena Hydro Boost Gel-Cream $16 (was $19, now 16% off) Even though it doesn\u2019t feel thick and heavy, Zeichner likes this gel-based Neutrogena moisturizer, which he says \u201cuses hyaluronic acid to deliver higher levels of hydration without weighing down facial skin.\u201d Our beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton explains that \u201chyaluronic-acid serums hydrate by penetrating deep down into the skin and increasing the skin\u2019s overall water content.\u201d All good things for Accutane-parched skin. $16 at Amazon Buy $16 at Amazon Buy\n\nSkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore 2:4:2 Another lightweight option, Chang recommends this cream because it\u2019s \u201cextremely moisturizing while not being too heavy on the skin.\u201d Along with ceramides, ingredients like fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamin E work to replenish the skin and prevent environmental damage. $128 at Dermstore Buy\n\nSkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream $59 (was $69, now 14% off) If you\u2019re concerned about warding off fine lines as well as keeping skin hydrated, Chang says the restorative peptides in this cream can prevent signs of aging while Accutane battles acne. $59 at Dermstore Buy\n\nBest bodywash for Accutane users\n\nDove Body Wash, Deep Moisture Since Accutane dries out skin all over, Zeichner suggests using Dove\u2019s moisturizing bodywash, as \u201cit contains ultrahydrating ingredients to moisturize the skin while you wash.\u201d And as good as a long, hot shower may feel in the moment, Chang suggests \u201climiting showers to five to ten minutes and using lukewarm water,\u201d as hot water can further dry out the skin. $6 at Amazon Buy $6 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest body moisturizers for Accutane users\n\nAveeno Skin Relief Intense Moisture Repair Cream $11 (was $12, now 8% off) \u201cThe best time to apply moisturizers is within three minutes of showering, when your skin absorbs the moisture the best,\u201d says Chang. So after your brief, not-too-steamy shower, reach for hydrating creams like this one, which she calls a \u201crich, fragrance-free and noncomedogenic cream to help repair dry skin while on Accutane.\u201d The addition of shea butter makes it extra soothing. $11 at Amazon Buy $11 at Amazon Buy\n\nAveeno Cracked Skin Relief Moisturizing CICA Balm With Oat This is also a good time to ditch light, liquid-y body lotions and go with thicker creams and balms to alleviate all-over dryness. \u201cI recommend healing balms like Aveeno CICA balm, which combines skin-soothing colloidal oatmeal in a rich, creamy ointment,\u201d says Zeichner. Oat helps repair the skin\u2019s natural barrier. $13 at Walmart Buy\n\nBest lip treatments for Accutane users\n\nCeraVe Healing Ointment $14 (was $15, now 7% off) According to Chang, more than 90 percent of Accutane users experience chapped lips, so it\u2019s essential to give lips extra attention to avoid painful drying and cracking. Zeichner recommends CeraVe healing ointment because it contains, in addition to hyaluronic acid, \u201cskin repairing ceramides in an ointment formula to form a protective seal over the lips.\u201d $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nAquaphor Lip Repair A cult favorite among Accutane users, Aquaphor \u2014 an occlusive that locks in moisture \u2014 is also one of Chang\u2019s favorite lip treatments. $4 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nBest sunscreen for Accutane users\n\nEltaMD UV Elements Tinted Broad Spectrum SPF 44 \u201cAccutane makes you extremely sensitive to the sun, so a broad-spectrum, high SPF sunscreen is a must,\u201d says Zeichner. We\u2019ve heard dermatologists rave about EltaMD sunscreen in the past, so it wasn\u2019t surprising to hear that Chang says this is her \u201cfavorite sunscreen for Accutane patients because it is a 100 percent physical sunscreen that provides broad-spectrum UV coverage and also contains hyaluronic acid to improve hydration in the skin.\u201d Compared to chemical sunscreens, physical ones are more gentle on sensitive skin. $33 at Dermstore Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
