Directs Ambassador Not to Testify in Impeachment Probe", "language": "en", "text": "The State Department on Tuesday directed Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, not to testify before House investigators heading up the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe against President Donald Trump.\n\nSondland was scheduled to appear privately before the House intelligence, foreign affairs, and oversight committees. The chairmen of each panel are looking to determine whether President Trump wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine to pressure President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating former Vice President and Democrat rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney said the ambassador was ordered by the State Department not to appear, while the New York Times reported earlier the appearance was blocked by the White House.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland had previously agreed to appear voluntarily today, without the need for a subpoena, in order to answer the committee\u2019s questions on an expedited basis,\u201d Sondland\u2019s attorney, Jim McDermott, said in a statement. \u201cAs the sitting U.S. Ambassador to the EU and employee of the State Department, Ambassador Sondland is required to follow the department\u2019s direction.\u201d\n\nText messages revealed by ABC News show Sondland defended President Trump\u2019s July 25th telephone call with the leader of Ukraine, affirming the president had said, \u201cno quid pro quo of any kind\u201d occurred between the two.\n\nThe texts show Bill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat to Ukraine, wrote to Sondland, \u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d seemingly a reference to allegations made by a partisan CIA officer\u2019s complaint regarding the Trump-Zelensky call.\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo of any kind,\u201d Sondland replied. \u201cThe president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nThe texts were provided by Kurt Volker, former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, during a closed-door testimony before House lawmakers last week.\n\nThe Trump-Zelensky conversation prompted House Democrats to launch a so-called formal impeachment inquiry into the president \u2014 despite the fact that the world leaders have both denied any pressure was applied to investigate the Bidens. In a nod to transparency, the White House released a transcript of the call to show no wrongdoing occurred.\n\nIn a pair of tweets, President Trump defended the move to block Sondland\u2019s testimony, stating the U.S. diplomat would have been appearing before a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify, but unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican\u2019s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public to see,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cImportantly, Ambassador Sondland\u2019s tweet, which few report, stated, \u201cI believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions. The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind.\u201d That says it ALL!\u201d\n\n\u2026.to see.
