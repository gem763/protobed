We crack on with the everyday, juggling our financial obligations with varying levels of success and just expect our credit scores to keep up somewhere in the background.\n\nBut as we were recently reminded, the assumption that all is fair, or at least accurate, in life and money is a dangerous one to make.\n\nSo what\u2019s the real cost of a low credit score? Probably a lot more than you think. This isn\u2019t just about the embarrassment of being refused a store card you were hoodwinked into applying for at the checkout.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNew research confirms that the consequences of a low credit score and a bad credit rating could mean huge losses to customers who are unaware of the impact their credit score has on a lender\u2019s decision.\n\nBorrowers with a lower credit score are charged higher interest rates because they\u2019re seen as a greater risk by a bank or lender.\n\nTrue cost\n\nA bad credit score could mean the interest on a \u00a33,000 credit card bill over two years could cost you almost \u00a32,000 more than it would if your rating was high. A personal loan of \u00a37,500 over four years could cost an extra \u00a37,453.\n\nAnd a \u00a3207,000 mortgage could cost an extra \u00a314,857 over the first five years, or \u00a378,500 extra over a 25-year term for a 90 per cent loan-to-value (LTV) loan.\n\nThese are crippling figures compared with the original loans, particularly for those whose financial circumstances aren\u2019t in a great state to start with.\n\nAlastair Douglas, CEO of TotallyMoney, which conducted the study with financial researcher Moneycomms, says: \u201cThe extra fees people pay for having a bad credit score are huge.\n\n\u201cLenders review a customer\u2019s credit report when they apply for a product. With a bad score, they\u2019re more likely to charge a higher APR, offer less interest-free months, or even reject an application.\n\n\u201cBeing informed about their score can help people to see where to improve and how to get the best deals. A report shows customers up to six years of credit history, and how much credit they are currently using.\n\nHow to improve your credit score\n\nA top-notch credit score is all about demonstrating to a potential lender that you are a responsible, stable and financially capable individual who will give them their money back as agreed.\n\nA poor score could be down to failure to pay bills on time and having high levels of existing borrowing compared with your income and expenditure. Even things that are out of your control can hinder your profile, such as errors on your file, fraudulent activity or simply being financially linked, through, for example, a joint account, to someone who struggles to manage their own money.\n\nWhere do you stand?\n\nFirst things first, check what your current credit score looks like. Long gone are the days when you had to pay through the nose for access to your own information so search out the free services to check the details.\n\nThis will allow you to see the records held about you and check for any questionable activity, genuine mistakes or to start the process of separating your financial affairs from those who are hindering your score.\n\nIt\u2019s worth doing this thoroughly as even a slightly incorrect address can have an impact. Report any incorrect details to the credit reference agency immediately.\n\nOnce you know the lie of the land you can start to take action in \u201creal\u201d life that will not only improve your rating but could also help you sleep at night.\n\nThings can only get better\n\nMake sure you pay your bills on time, including mobile and landline costs as well as big payments like a mortgage, the Money Advice Service warns. And try to pay off existing debt before taking on new borrowing.\n\n\u201cThis is because banks, building societies and credit card companies might be hesitant about lending you more if you already have a lot of existing debt,\u201d the independent information service adds.\n\n\u201cYour credit utilisation is how much of your available credit limit you use. For example, if you have a credit limit of \u00a32,000 and you\u2019ve used \u00a31,000 of that, your credit utilisation is 50 per cent, so you\u2019re using half of your credit limit.\n\n\u201cUsually, using less of your available credit will be seen positively by lenders, and will increase your credit score as a result. If possible, try and keep your credit utilisation at 25 per cent or lower.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, register on the electoral roll and remember that a lender is much happier lending to those who don\u2019t move around too much.\n\nCounty court judgments against you can have a massive effect on your credit score too. If you\u2019re worried about unsustainable problem debt contact one of the free debt charities for help sooner rather than later, such as StepChange or NationalDebtline\n\nThese organisations provide completely free advice and support and shouldn\u2019t be confused with commercial debt management firms with similar names that will charge you for their input.", "description": "Most of us don\u2019t give them a second thought from one week to the next.
