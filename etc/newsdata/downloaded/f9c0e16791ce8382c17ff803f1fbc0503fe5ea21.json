They will affect everyone in the country who wishes to exercise their right to vote (Picture: Tolga Akmen/WPA Pool/Getty Images)\n\nIn the Queen\u2019s Speech today, the government has announced plans to require voters to produce photographic ID at the ballot box before being able to vote at all upcoming local and general elections.\n\nThe effects of these reforms are incredibly wide-ranging. They will affect everyone in the country who wishes to exercise their right to vote. The proposals are already proving controversial, but what is going under-discussed is the potentially chilling effect this will have on the rights of the millions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people living in the UK.\n\nStudies in the US have shown that restrictive identification requirements there have been particularly disadvantageous to certain voter groups who are less likely to possess government-approved ID for a variety of socioeconomic and accessibility reasons. These groups are traditionally marginalised groups, including LGBT people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA major part of this is down to the cost. A new driving licence costs \u00a334 if the application is submitted online and \u00a343 if the application is submitted by post, and a new passport costs \u00a375.50 if the application is made online and \u00a385 if the application is submitted by post. This may not seem like much to some, but to others it is more than they have.\n\nSo, why does this impact LGBT people in particular? Because LGBT people are statistically less likely to be in full-time employment, and much more likely to face barriers in accessing employment or have to leave a job due to discrimination. Lesbian women and trans women, even when in employment, earn less on average than women in general.\n\nThere\u2019s already a heavy financial cost that comes with being transgender, and these reforms will only further add to this burden if a trans person wants to exercise their basic democratic right to vote\n\nHaving no fixed address presents another major roadblock to getting approved identification \u2013 it\u2019s pretty self-evident that it\u2019s much harder to get a form of ID if you have nowhere to send it to. Homelessness also disproportionately affects LGBT people, with Albert Kennedy Trust figures showing that 24 per cent of homeless young people (aged 16 to 25) are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans.\n\nAll of these problems are compounded and amplified for the trans and non-binary community. A trans or non-binary person\u2019s photo or gender marker on their ID may not reflect their gender expression or identity, and so even if they do have an ID to present, they could face challenges from polling staff. This would likely be distressing and uncomfortable, and may force someone to out themselves as trans or non-binary against their will.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn unintended consequence of this could be that some trans or non-binary people are turned away from voting stations. Anticipating this kind of negative reaction, many trans and non-binary people will be discouraged from going to vote at all.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that trans people already face barriers to registering to vote, with some trans people\u2019s National Insurance numbers being protected and classified by HMRC as \u2018sensitive information\u2019. This prevents the voter from registering online. Instead, they have to present themselves with a number of identification documents to their local council in order to register.\n\nThere\u2019s already a heavy financial cost that comes with being transgender, and these reforms will only further add to this burden if a trans person wants to exercise their basic democratic right to vote. There are a number of costs incurred to trans people who want to obtain approved ID that reflects their gender. It costs \u00a317 to change your photo on your driving licence. A new passport with a change of gender costs \u00a375, and requires a letter from a GP or medical professional, which costs \u00a325.\n\nThis, alongside the increased workplace discrimination and lower levels of employment in the trans community, creates further barriers for trans people in obtaining an approved ID that won\u2019t result in them being turned away at the polls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s still some way to go, but most people would agree that there has been progress for LGBT communities over the past few decades: equal marriage, increased visibility, and the Equality Act have been just a few milestones. None of this could have been accomplished if we hadn\u2019t spoken up and had our voices heard \u2013 particularly at the ballot box.\n\nOur vote is more than just putting a cross on a piece of paper, it is a fundamental democratic right. These reforms will likely render thousands of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people disenfranchised, and represent a major step backwards for the progress of our communities.\n\nMORE: If Black History Month does not include LGBT+ people, it is not Black history\n\nMORE: Like Freddy McConnell, I know the hoops transgender parents have to jump through to be recognised\n\nMORE: I\u2019ve written the LGBT+ children\u2019s book I wish I had and I want it in every school", "description": "LGBTQ people will be disproportionately affected by the voter ID, one of the schemes listed in the Queen's Speech 2019.", "authors": ["Sophie Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175873462_1571069580.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
