These new segments work particularly well because the interviewers are good friends of Colbert\u2019s \u2014 first fellow is Daily Show alum John Oliver, and then the other is his former Strangers With Candy collaborator Amy Sedaris. (Both segments appear to be saved up from Oliver\u2019s and Sedaris\u2019s Late Show appearances from February.) Oliver takes his turn at the desk to ask Colbert a series of supposedly \u201cclassic first-date questions\u201d he found online, which Colbert finds quite attractive. \u201cYou\u2019re cute,\u201d he tells Oliver during the segment. \u201cThank you,\u201d Oliver responds. \u201cYou\u2019re coming on a little strong, but I do like to be chased.\u201d As is the case with any typical first date, the conversation includes Colbert predicting his own death, which involves a horrific contraption around his face where he\u2019s forced to drink water as it fills over his face before inevitably drowning.\n\nAfter that, Oliver asks Colbert what friendship has impacted him the most, and Colbert drops the reality hammer and gives a startlingly sweet, sincere answer. \u201cMy wife. Without a doubt. No one comes close. The most harrowing idea would be that I would spend any part of my life without her, because that would be a level of loneliness and irreplaceable, irredeemable emotional desolation that I could not possibly contemplate. And I understand why old men die like a month after their wives go, because how I will actually die is she will die first and I will not last a year,\u201d he says. \u201cOkay,\u201d Oliver responds, \u201ccheck please. I\u2019m wasting my fucking time here.\u201d\n\nSedaris\u2019s segment with Colbert delves into their days performing comedy in Chicago and working together on Strangers With Candy. Colbert showers Sedaris with praise: \u201cI like to tell people that writing for you was one of the proudest things I\u2019ve ever done. You\u2019re one of the funniest people on the planet, and to have written anything that you said was a real source of pride for me. I brag about it.\u201d Sedaris then presents Colbert with a series of \u201ctrigger words,\u201d which are really just reminders of different memories they made together with comedian Paul Dinello as they were in the early phase of their careers. For example, they look back on the time when Sedaris made Colbert laugh so hard while improvising onstage with her and Dinello that Colbert got pissed, stormed backstage, locked himself in the bathroom, and cried. \u201cAnd you stood outside that bathroom door, and the two of you mocked me,\u201d Colbert remembers, \u201cand I realized in that room that you had broken something in me, and I came out a changed man \u2026 I came out and I was never as professional as I should be again.\u201d", "description": "CBS\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d released two clips, in which Stephen Colbert is interviewed by his comedy friends John Oliver and Amy Sedaris.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-colbert-olivier.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
