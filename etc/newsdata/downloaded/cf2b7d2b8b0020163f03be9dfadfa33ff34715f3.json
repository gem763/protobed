Moody\u2019s election forecasts have been very reliable in the past, correctly predicting every election result except 2016. The model undercounted support for Trump because it did not anticipate the increase in voter turnout that shifted the majority vote in crucial states. Importantly, Moody\u2019s models all predict Trump wins even if the economy dips to multiyear lows by the end of 2020 and the stock market crashes 9 percent. In other words, Trump is expected to win despite a falling stock market and a sagging economy.\n\nNonetheless, voter turnout could also play a huge role in the election results.\n\nAs Breitbart News detailed:\n\nIf turnout by Democrats and independents voting against Trump is low to average, Trump easily wins under the models. If it climbs to the historical maximum, Trump would lose under the stock market and unemployment models but still win in the pocketbook model.\u201d\n\nSanders will appear at a highly anticipated \u201cBernie\u2019s Back Rally\u201d in New York Saturday afternoon alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and left-wing filmmaker Michael Moore:\n\nTomorrow: I'm so excited to be joined by @MMFlint and @AOC in New York for a rally to show the billionaire class we're ready to take them on.
