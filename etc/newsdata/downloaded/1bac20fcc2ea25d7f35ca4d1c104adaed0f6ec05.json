A disorderly, no deal exit of the UK would be extremely harmful for all sides. It would cause massive damage for citizens and businesses in the UK and on the continent alike,\" BusinessEurope Director General Markus Beyrer said.\n\nBusinessEurope is a lobby group that speaks for all sizes of enterprises in 34 European countries, including Britain.\n\n\"The negative consequences would not be limited to the exit date but would drag on, endangering the fruitful and positive future relationship we all aim for,\" Beyrer said.", "description": "EU businesses warn no-deal Brexit would be disaster", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8E0RK_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
