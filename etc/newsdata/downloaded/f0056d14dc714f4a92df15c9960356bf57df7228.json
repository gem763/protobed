The Brooklyn Nets defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 114-111, and most of the seats were actually filled with excited fans.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news.\n\nThe bad?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nHey, LeBron, what did you think of the game, playing alongside Anthony Davis and getting to perform in front of the Chinese?\n\nWho knows?\n\nThe Chinese government mandated that no players or coaches speak to the media \u2026 and the NBA actually accepted that absurd demand \u2026 and \u2026 well, this latest sad concession is par for the league\u2019s terrible, no-good, very-bad week.\n\nPretty much everything has gone wrong for the NBA, and even China itself, since Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey sent a mild tweet last Friday showing support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. It\u2019s basically been one disaster after the other.\n\nEven Thursday\u2019s game was only a marginal success. It wasn\u2019t shown on television in China. Logos of corporate sponsors were stripped off the court. Promotional events surrounding it were canceled. There were some empty seats.\n\nAt the same time, the NBA has become such a punching bag in the United States that it created a rare bipartisan consensus in Washington.\n\nChinese fans enjoy Thursday's preseason NBA game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers at the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai. (AP Photo)\n\nA diverse group of politicians, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York \u2014 neither of whom is very popular outside of their polar-opposite bases \u2014 agreed to express their collective \u201cdeep concern\u201d about the league.\n\n\u201cIt is outrageous that the Chinese Communist Party is using its economic power to suppress the speech of Americans inside the United States,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cIt is also outrageous that the NBA has caved to Chinese government demands for contrition.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThis may be outrageous, but it is also what many American companies that operate in China do on a daily basis. It\u2019s the cost of doing business there.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump was calling Golden State coach Steve Kerr a \u201clittle boy\u201d for not speaking up on China and Hong Kong due to economic concerns, even though Trump himself has not spoken up on China and Hong Kong, reportedly, via CNN, because he told the Chinese president he wouldn\u2019t during trade negotiations.\n\nSpecifics hardly matter, though. It is open season on the NBA, which made itself the target by not immediately responding in clear and unambiguous terms to China\u2019s original overreaction to the Morey tweet.\n\nThe league has never shied away from throwing its economic weight around in the United States when it comes to social issues. Kerr and a slew of players routinely sound off or get directly involved in all sorts of political issues, debates or criticisms of Trump.\n\nNow \u2026 not much. Even on something as simple as expressing support for protesters who believe they are fighting new laws that could impact their basic civil liberties.\n\nAt a news conference following Thursday\u2019s Houston-Toronto game in Tokyo, even reasonable questions about the situation directed toward Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook were shut down by a team public-relations official, which wanted \u201cbasketball-only\u201d queries.\n\nPlayers and coaches can argue that it isn\u2019t their job to speak up on everything (fair enough), or that they are focused on issues that concern their communities (reasonable), or that they aren\u2019t comfortable weighing in on foreign affairs (understandable). Or that if the White House doesn\u2019t care about Hong Kong, why should they (valid)? But perception is reality, and the real perception is they look like hypocrites.\n\nThis entire week has been an exercise in terrible. The finer points of the argument have been lost in the onslaught of the defeat. China is slapping the NBA around.\n\nThere is one more exhibition game: Saturday in Shenzhen. That city is located right next to Hong Kong and will take place on a weekend, which is when protests during the past five months have traditionally been larger and stronger. Nice backdrop.\n\nAfter that, the league needs to get the hell back home and hope the dust settles. If nothing else, opening night is Oct. 22.\n\nHow many Zion Williamson dunks will it take for people to forget all this?\n\nIt might take a lot of them. The league is now a touchstone for anti-China protests, drawing activists who actually plan out their viral moments by hoping to get ejected from NBA games. And Trump will no doubt revel in turning the NBA into a Kaepernick-esque applause line during rallies. It\u2019s low-hanging fruit for both sides of the aisle.\n\nBack in China, who knows what the league\u2019s business future looks like? It\u2019s spent decades cultivating a rabid audience into a billion-dollar business that turns star players into valued conduits to 1.4 billion citizens.\n\nNow that could, conceivably, disappear, or at least be curtailed, which affects bottom lines and perhaps even future salary caps.\n\nThis has been ugly all around, a clear narrative set against a league that is stuck trying to argue the nuances while hoping it isn\u2019t about to lose its pot of gold on the other side of the Pacific. Meanwhile, China\u2019s effort to silence discussion of the Hong Kong protests backfired by generating an unfathomable amount of global publicity \u2026 for the Hong Kong protests.\n\nAll of it could flare back up with just one NBA-associated tweet, one supportive message written on a player\u2019s sneaker, one escalation of the Trump-Kerr feud.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s terrible, no-good, very-bad week is drawing to a close. How long the fallout lingers is the question.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The season can\u2019t start soon enough for the league, but even then, another flareup is just a tweet or sound bite away.", "authors": ["Dan Wetzel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ae.zY05MxZEISufWUofCEg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F2MSpeAlR2fmEwqdOI3XKA--~B/aD0xODUwO3c9Mjc3NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/c295e920-eb7b-11e9-aabf-4627ce0041e1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
