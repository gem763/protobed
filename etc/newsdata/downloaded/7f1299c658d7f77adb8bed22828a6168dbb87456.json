Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d Hong Kong is currently in its fifth month of peaceful, pro-democracy protests urging its government to keep Beijing from imposing its draconian speech and religion restrictions on the capitalist city. China\u2019s puppet government in Hong Kong began using live gunfire this week to subdue unarmed protesters and regularly threatens an escalation of violence against the millions-strong movement.\n\nThe most recent protester gunned down by Hong Kong police is a 14-year-old boy.\n\nThe NBA issued an effusive apology after Morey extended support to the movement. Commissioner Adam Silver then attempted to respond to outrage in the United States by saying that \u201cDaryl Morey is supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression,\u201d but not specifying if the NBA is the one supporting him.\n\nThe NBA has also established a training camp in Xinjiang, western China \u2013 home to thousands of concentration camps where as many as 3 million people, mostly Muslim ethnic Uighurs, are subjected to torture, rape, slavery, organ harvesting, and forced sterilization.\n\nFollowing the Morey controversy, Marlow noted, \u201cIf you\u2019re watching the NBA or supporting that product, you have to come to grips with the fact that you are supporting an industry that is working with the Chinese Communist Party, a regime that oppresses tens of millions, hundreds of millions \u2026 and you\u2019re okay with it if you\u2019re an NBA supporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe overlap of NBA fans and people that are extremely invested in the Uighur situation in western China \u2013 that\u2019s not a big overlap, and suddenly it could be,\u201d Martel noted.\n\n\u201cEvery teenager who watches NBA and looks up to those players knows what the Holocaust is, knows what concentration camps are \u2026 and these kids are going to find out that China is doing that today, while they are alive,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd we are constantly told \u2026 we can\u2019t let something like that happen on our watch again and the greatness of America comes from the fact that we stood up to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery kid who looks up to an NBA player is aware that now is their time to stand up,\u201d Martel concluded.\n\nMartel also remarked on the news that President Donald Trump is moving 50 troops out of northwestern Syria elsewhere within the country, which sparked near-universal outrage in Washington.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 50 people, and they\u2019re leaving Syria, they\u2019re not coming home to a hero\u2019s welcome, they\u2019re going to a different part of Syria. The extent to which this is not a major move is incredible to me,\u201d she noted, decrying \u201ccareer opportunists who have now decided that they are Kurdish separatists\u201d like Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT). Washington insiders condemned Trump for \u201cabandoning\u201d the Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) who operate in Syria to the mercy of the Turkish army, which has been planning to invade the region for over a year.\n\n\u201cI remember in the 2016 election, a lot of Republicans who were running would talk about the Kurds as a monolith, that there is just one group of people who are Kurds and we like them. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Martel noted. \u201cThe Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, who are the militias who help the United States, are allies to the PKK [Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party], who are a Marxist terrorist organization. And those are separate from the Iraqi Kurds, the Kurdistan Regional Government, who want nothing to do with the Syrian Kurds or the PKK. So none of this nuance was found anywhere in mainstream media yesterday.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.", "description": "The NBA China scandal has created a situation where every young American NBA fan is being challenged to reject authoritarianism.", "authors": ["Breitbart News"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/houston-rockets-mascot-getty-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
