He felt something in the bone and has to stop. He had something to clean up the knee. It was not a big issue. Five or six weeks.\u2019\n\nAdding on Rodri\u2019s situation: \u2018They told me after the [November] international break maybe he will be ready again.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis would see Rodri come back for Man City\u2019s home game against Chelsea on 23 November in the Premier League.\n\nCity have been struggling with injuries at the back, which forced Guardiola into playing Rodri at centre-back rather than his preferred position of central midfield.\n\nHowever, they have been boosted by the returns to fitness of John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi, both of whom had been out through injury but are available for this weekend\u2019s clash with Aston Villa.\n\nGuardiola may choose to partner the returning pair in the middle of defence, or play one of them alongside Fernandinho who has also been filling in there.\n\nAt left-back, in Zinchenko\u2019s absence, Benjamin Mendy or Joao Cancelo will fill the berth.\n\nFirst choice centre back Aymeric Laporte remains out with a significant knee ligament injury and will not return until next year.\n\nMORE: Pep Guardiola almost signed Arsenal star Bernd Leno for Manchester City before buying Ederson instead\n\nMORE: John Stones explains Pep Guardiola telling off during Manchester City\u2019s win over Atalanta", "description": "Oleksandr Zinchenko and Rodri are both set for a number of weeks on the sidelines, leaving Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola with serious injury problems in defence.
