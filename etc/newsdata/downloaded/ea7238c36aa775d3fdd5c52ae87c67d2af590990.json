The crew on this flight consisted of seven active-duty Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard members.\n\nThe flight took off from Anchorage on March 13, making stops at bases in Nevada and New Hampshire before going to Glasgow Prestwick Airport and eventually Ali Al Salem base in Kuwait. The crew was back in Alaska on March 19.\n\nA local government contractor made the Scotland reservations, and indicated there was not a room closer to the airport than the Trump resort, 54 miles away, Thomas said.\n\nThat, Thomas said, was not a remarkable distance to travel to receive the government rate for the rooms.\n\nHe said the Trump resort had rooms for $136 a night, cheaper than a Marriott, which charged $161 a night. However, he said both are under the per diem rate of $166.\n\n\u201cWhile we are still reviewing the trip records, we have found nothing that falls outside the guidelines associated with selecting stopover airports on travel routes and hotel accommodations for crew rest,\u201d said Thomas, the director of Air Force Public Affairs.\n\nHe said records are being reviewed, but it appears the crew stayed at a Marriott near Glasgow on its return trip to Alaska.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to say that the airplane used in the mission was a C-17.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Military officials are disputing a report that claims a joint Air Force and Alaska Air National Guard unit on a refueling mission to Kuwait went miles out of their way to spend the night at a resort in Scotland owned by President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Thiessen"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
