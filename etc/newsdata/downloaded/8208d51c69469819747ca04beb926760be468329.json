But according to the magazine, the film was axed because the China Red Culture Research Association \u2014 a research group sympathetic to the ruling Communist Party \u2014 said the film depicted the Kuomintang too sensitively.\n\n\"It is a reversal of history, and misleads the audience. If left unchecked, it will certainly deprive the entire Communist Party of its historical basis,\" the group's secretary-general Wang Benzhou said, according to Variety.\n\nCensors also pulled \"The Hidden Sword,\" a long-awaited summer movie about about a 1930s military officer who led the Chinese fight against Japanese soldiers at the Great Wall, for \"market reasons.\"\n\nAgain, critics are skeptical about the true reasons for the film being scrapped, and some believe it was axed because the movie's hero fought for the Kuomintang instead of the Communist Party, the South China Morning Post and Variety reported.\n\nChinese firefighters take an oath of loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party flag near the Great Hall of the People, Beijing, in March 2019.

A total of 68 movies were scheduled to be shown in the country between late June and the end of August, Quartz reported in July, citing statistics from China's Maoyan movie-ticketing site.\n\nFans in homemade replica armor of Marvel characters watch \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" in Changchun, Jilin province, China, in May 2015. Reuters\n\nChinese domestic censorship has cleared the way for Hollywood to take advantage\n\nChina's increased censorship may have tanked the release of some of its biggest domestic movies, but in doing so, Beijing has made way for American blockbusters to fill the gap.\n\nThis in turn has negated Hollywood producers' fears that China would use the US movie industry as a stick to beat Washington with in the ongoing trade war between the two countries by not importing Hollywood films.\n\nHollywood studios are heavily reliant on overseas box offices for revenues, with China being the most important market.\n\nUnder an official quota, China can publicly screen 34 foreign films a year. These movies generally come from countries with sizable movie industries like the US, UK, South Korea, and India, and the film producers take a cut of the box-office earnings made in China.\n\nWhile countries like the UK do contribute, Hollywood films currently account for 85% to 90% of the total number of imported films in the Chinese market, Zhang said.\n\nThe quota has been surpassed in both of the last two years, and was meant to be renegotiated in 2017, but that renegotiation has been kicked into the long grass, possibly due to the trade war, according to both Reuters and The South China Morning Post. China imported 40 revenue-sharing films in 2017 and 42 in 2018, according to IHS Markit statistics.\n\nHollywood producers typically take 35% to 40% of the market share from Chinese cinemas, Zhang said.\n\nUS and Canadian box offices earned a total of $11.9 billion on all films last year, while China alone earned $9 billion, according to the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\nSo precious is the revenue made by Hollywood movies in China, producers have even appeared to self-censor movies in order to pass censors and ensure their films are shown.\n\nMost recently the \"Top Gun: Maverick\" appeared to censor itself by removing a Taiwanese flag from the jacket of its titular character, Maverick, played by Tom Cruise.\n\nRead more: 4 times Hollywood changed movies to keep China happy\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping Reuters/Pool\n\nHaving feared that the Chinese box office revenue stream would dry up as a result of the trade war, Beijing's scrapping of its own blockbusters \"leaves a big opening for Hollywood blockbusters to show, even over the summer,\" Rosen said.\n\nAnd the numbers show it:\n\n\"Avengers: Endgame\" broke box-office records by earning $614 million in China alone in May. It made $850 million in the US by comparison, according to Forbes.\n\n\"The Lion King\" raked in $97 million in China in July.\n\n\"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" earned $97.2 million in its opening weekend this July.\n\n\"Hobbs & Shaw\" earned $164 million in its first ten days in China \u2014 surpassing the $157 million earned in North America over its first three weekends, Variety reported. This was actually an underperformance in the country given the popularity of the franchise and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\n\n\"Chinese people have continued to show enthusiasm in watching big Hollywood films,\" Jue Wang, a lecturer at the Leiden University Institute for Area Studies, told Business Insider.\n\nRead more: 9 Hollywood movies that dominated the Chinese box office in 2018, including some that underperformed in the US\n\nDwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson meets fans at the \"Fast & Furious: Hobbs & Shaw\" press conference in Beijing, China, on August 5, 2019. Lintao Zhang/Getty\n\nHollywood's success at the Chinese box office in 2019 counters fears among film producers that China would stop importing American films to punish President Donald Trump over the trade war.\n\nThe Washington Post in June cited producers as saying that they are already working under the assumption of a Chinese freeze on American films, and that \"the industry is operating as if it's close to a total shutdown.\"\n\n\"People say with the trade war, for example, is going to hurt Hollywood. But in fact for a variety of reasons the trade war has not hurt Hollywood blockbusters at all,\" Rosen told Business Insider.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping make joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, November 9, 2017. Reuters/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe Communist Party's censorship isn't the only reason behind Hollywood's unexpected success in China, though.\n\nChina, in a way, can't afford to boycott all Hollywood films. The country's nascent film industry doesn't make enough movies to prop up the market alone \u2014 the US and UK each produce about 700 films a year, while China only produces 300, Zhang said.\n\n\"So they [China] do need a lot of diversity and a lot of options for cinema-goers,\" she said.\n\nAnother reason behind Hollywood's summer boom is that there have just been a bunch of great movies this year, and China simply doesn't want to miss out.\n\n\"Hollywood this year has had very strong titles, like 'Avengers: Endgame,'\" Zhang said. \"It's a very big title and has performed very well \u2014 not only in China, [but] in every country, every market.\"\n\nDisney\n\nHollywood takes advantage, but independent US movies are suffering in China\n\nNot all American movies are safe from the trade war, though. Independent, lower-budget films have been suffering since 2017, months before Trump began his trade war.\n\nAfter Beijing ordered businesses to clamp down on investing abroad in 2017 \u2014 an effort to stop too much money from leaving the country \u2014 one of the first things that lost Chinese investment were independent films, Wang said. Trade tensions have further exacerbated this hesitancy, she said.\n\nRosen said: \"No one knows whether the Chinese authorities are going to approve showing these films because of the trade war with the US, for example, [and] whether theater owners will show these films in theaters.\"\n\n\"Hollywood's doing well, but independent filmmakers are not,\" he added.\n\nPeople walk past a poster of the Chinese-made 3D movie \"Ne Zha\" at a cinema in Taiyuan, China, on August 2, 2019.
