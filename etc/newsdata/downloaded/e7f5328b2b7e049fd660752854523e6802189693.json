The bill has not yet gone before parliament.\n\nZelensky on Wednesday called for the ten MPs involved to take the lie detector test.\n\nSo far, the lawmakers are not facing any charges but investigators have launched a probe after journalists and bloggers reported a possible crime.\n\nIf these checks find \"even the slightest possibility that the lawmakers took the money... then the anti-corruption authorities should deal with these lawmakers,\" Zelensky wrote on Facebook.\n\nLater Dubinsky, a member of the committee in question, was as good as his word and aired his lie detector test live on the internet.\n\n\"Did you personally vote against this bill in exchange for a bribe?\" he was asked by an expert carrying out the test.\n\n\"Did anyone promise to pay you for a vote against this bill?\" the expert continued, after the MP replied \"no\" to the first question.\n\nIt was not clear when all the deputies involved would take the lie detector test.\n\nZelensky, a former comedian, won presidential elections in spring on a programme promising to eradicate corruption.\n\nAccording to Transparency International Ukraine is ranked 120th out of 180 on the NGO's corruption perception index, faring better than Russia (in 138th place) but still falling far behind its European Union neighbours.", "description": "A lawmaker from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's party took a lie detector test on Wednesday after the president called for a group of MPs to be tested over corruption allegations.
