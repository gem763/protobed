Women will still need to dress modestly in public, and non-Muslims will still be forbidden from visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nSo what can Saudi's new tourists expect to see?\n\nAl Wahbah volcanic crater\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nIn the middle of the desert, some 250 km (155 miles) away from the city of Taif, is Al Wahbah - a large volcanic crater with a salt field in its centre.\n\nAl Wahbah has become popular with hikers in recent years, although it is a challenge. As the crater is 820 ft deep, it takes competent hikers about two to three hours to get down to the bottom and back up again.\n\nFor those hoping for something a bit less active, it is also a popular camping spot.\n\nThe ancient city of Mada'in Saleh\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMada'in Saleh was the second largest city of the Nabateans, a group of people who settled across ancient Arabia and the Jordan Valley until their empire was annexed by the Romans in 106 CE.\n\nNow, among the ruins are a vast necropolis with 130 tombs, small pre-Islamic altars, and some adobe houses - structures made from earth - in what used to be the city's living quarters.\n\nMada'in Saleh was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2008 - the first site in Saudi Arabia to get this accolade.\n\nHistoric Jeddah and the Gate to Mecca\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nAnother Unesco World Heritage Site is the Gate to Mecca, located in Historic Jeddah.\n\nIn the 7th Century CE, Jeddah was established as both a major port for Indian Ocean trade routes, and the entry point for Muslim pilgrims who arrived by sea on their way to the religious city of Mecca.\n\nMasmak Fortress in Riyadh\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nMasmak Fortress in the Saudi capital Riyadh was first built in about 1865 - but it is most well known for what happened 37 years later.\n\nIn 1902, the exiled royal, Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud, returned to his ancestral hometown Riyadh and seized this fortress.\n\nBased at Masmak, he went on to conquer the different kingdoms of the region, before eventually uniting them to form what is now the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n\nKing Fahd's Fountain\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nKing Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah is said to be the tallest fountain in the world.\n\nConservative estimates say the fountain, which was donated to the city by the late King Fahd, can shoot saltwater up to 853 ft (260 metres) high - although some estimates put this closer to 1,000 ft.\n\nAt night, it is lit up by more than 500 spotlights.\n\nAll pictures copyright", "description": "The kingdom is introducing a new visa regime for 49 countries, to open the country up to tourists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8399/production/_108998633_gettyimages-513316740.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
