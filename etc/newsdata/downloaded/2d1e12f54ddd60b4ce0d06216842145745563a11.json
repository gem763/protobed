They say all students who meet criteria for advanced courses should be automatically enrolled, with the choice of opting out if students or families desire.\n\nThey are pressing for a regular collaboration with the school board and school system so that goals are set and progress is monitored.\n\nTwo dozen other organizations have signed on as members, including the county\u2019s council of PTAs and groups that typically focus on health issues, politics and business.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this concerted effort,\u201d said Laura Stewart, a vice president of the Montgomery County Council of Parent-Teacher Associations. \u201cGetting the data has spurred a call to action. Just to see the numbers in black and white, you can\u2019t not take action.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe coalition is expected to gather Tuesday at Gaithersburg High School with elected officials, advocates and community members.\n\n\u201cThe same issues have been on the table for 40, 50 years, and somehow there\u2019s been little meaningful progress,\u201d Johns said. \u201cBusiness as usual can\u2019t continue. It\u2019ll be a disaster for this county.\u201d\n\nMontgomery\u2019s fast-growing school system is about 31 percent Hispanic, 28 percent white, 22 percent black, 14 percent Asian and 5 percent multiracial. Enrollment has climbed year after year for more than a decade, including a jump to 165,380 for the 2019-2020 school year, according to preliminary figures.\n\nAD\n\nJohns said the school system and union leaders have been supportive of the organization and its efforts.\n\nAD\n\nHe and others say timing is important, pointing to equity initiatives on the state and county levels, including release of school-by-school data on achievement gaps, as tracked by race, poverty, and a combination of race and poverty.\n\nThey also note the state\u2019s Kirwan Commission, designed to transform public education in Maryland, is focused on equity in funding.\n\nSchool system spokesman Derek Turner said the study was commissioned so the district could look beyond aggregated data and \u201cpull back the curtain.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo understand where we want to go, we have to really explore where we are now, and this data helps us do that,\u201d he said.\n\nTurner said the school system appreciates the advocacy efforts. \u201cWe want to work with people in our community to make sure every student has the resources and opportunities to meet their full potential,\u201d he said.\n\nAD", "description": "Montgomery students of color are more likely to have novice teachers and less rigor, study finds.", "authors": ["Donna St. George", "Reporter Covering Education"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/UVvfYyESULe_XKCx3pnNYYMOFTI=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ENHJTZRZBUI6TMIL6BNCFZ2YMU.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
