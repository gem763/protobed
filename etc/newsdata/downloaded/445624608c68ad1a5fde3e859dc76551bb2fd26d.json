This is an ongoing case and I cannot speculate on a timeline yet or make any other comment.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThe revelation comes after the Duchess of Sussex spoke of her anguish at unfavourable press coverage related to her and her family.\n\nA source said: \u201cThe allegations relate to numerous internet platforms and include complaints from at least four countries, including the UK, Canada and Sweden.\n\n\"It is a large and widespread investigation and is likely to be a long process.\n\n\"The investigation is still at an early stage.\u201d\n\nThe exact content of the messages are unclear and there is no suggestion the investigation was triggered by a complaint from the royals.\n\nThe police probe is the Markle family\u2019s latest brush with the law.\n\nLast month, Meghan\u2019s nephew Thomas Dooley was arrested on a felony charge in Hollywood after attracting the attention of locals when he loudly made his way through a street wearing only a small towel wrapped around his waist.\n\nWhen police approached him, he allegedly tried to walk away, forcing officers to get him on the ground and subdue him. He was then booked for allegedly resisting arrest.\n\nThomas\u2019 brother Tyler, 25, who is a cannabis farmer in Oregon, US, was also quizzed by police for allegedly possessing an illegal pepper spray and a knife during the weekend of the royal wedding.\n\nThe pair\u2019s dad, Thomas Markle, has also been arrested for allegedly holding a gun to his partner Darlene Blount\u2019s head and drink driving.\n\nAnd she has twice been arrested by police for allegedly assaulting him.\n\nSamantha\u2019s partner Mark Phillips tonight said: \u201cWhoever wants an investigation against me and Sam, well they are likely to end up in jail for five years for filing a false police report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not doing any cyber bullying, other than retaliating.
