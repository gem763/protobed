No titles needed, either. Could be a title. I don't think that's really important to him.

He would have to prep six months to get to that. He would have to set it up to get done.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nJorge Masvidal says Dana White won't let him fight Conor McGregor in case he ends up murdering him\n\nA 24-year-old American scored an 8-second knockout, backflipped off the Bellator cage, then said he wants a 'mother-f------ belt'\n\nPETA has urged the UFC to 'evaluate its relationship' with Khabib Nurmagomedov after 'loathsome' footage resurfaced showing him fighting a chained-up bear", "description": "Georges St-Pierre's trainer, Firas Zahabi, says a UFC return for the Canadian isn't worth it unless it's for a \"mega fight\" with McGregor or Khabib.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d95db1978c0cd1b5536fa37?width=1200&format=jpeg"}
