Her injuries have prevented her from going to school full time, so she attends for three hours a day and takes online classes. She\u2019s still on track to graduate with her classmates.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely hard. There are times when I just want to go out and ride (horses),\u201d Turner said. \u201cI just want to be normal again. I just want to be me. But this is me now, and I just have to embrace it.\u201d\n\nA 14-year-old Turner was shot in the back of the head and left in a ditch in February 2017. Colter D. Peterson and Jayzon Decker, both 17, were sentenced to at least 15 years in prison last year for the shooting in Smithfield, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of Salt Lake City.\n\nThe pair concocted a plan while playing video games and discussing their desire to \"get rid\" of Turner, who was messaging Peterson on social media, prosecutors said. They lured her to a dry canal bed behind a high school in a town neighboring where she goes to school.\n\nTurner was elected queen in voting by nearly 1,400 students, the school said. She got dressed up and put on a crown for a series of events last week \u2014 fitting in some naps in between to conserve her energy.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot, but it was so worth it,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI truly wish every one of us high school girls would be able to experience such a magical night.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Herald Journal, http://www.hjnews.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
