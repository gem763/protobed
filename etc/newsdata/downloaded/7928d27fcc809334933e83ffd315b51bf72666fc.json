It carries the same unstructured shape that set the scene for Julian Alaphilippe\u2019s wild run in the yellow jersey, and clearly there is appetite for more of the same.\n\nOn the face of it this route is entirely different to 2019. If that was the \u201chighest in history\u201d then this is perhaps the hardest for some years \u2013 less catchy, admittedly \u2013 with eight stages officially listed as mountainous and a solitary 36km time-trial which in itself will be demanding, ending most of the way up the gruelling La Planche des Belles Filles.\n\nThere will fewer of the high altitudes that played into the hands of the eventual 2019 champion, Team Ineos\u2019s Egan Bernal, but instead several small flurries of mountainous sections dotted through the three weeks beginning with stage two, meaning there is very little in the way of let-up bar back-to-back flat days on stages 10 and 11.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIt is hard to know exactly who this suits. The rolling hills from the start make it a course for Alaphilippe to attack early and grab hold of the yellow jersey, but he might struggle to keep it through stages eight and nine when the Port de Bales and Col de Peyresourde home into view.\n\nWill the darling of France make a dedicated effort to win the race, having come so close in the summer? Organisers ASO will certainly hope so. \u201cOn paper, yes, there are plenty of stages that suit me \u2013 that suit me very well, even,\u201d said Alaphilippe. \u201dBut it\u2019s still far away. I have to study the parcours in more detail, and go out and recon the stages, in order to get a clearer idea. For the moment, I can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\nThe extensive climbing will please natural climbers like Bernal and his teammate Chris Froome, who is aiming to join an elite club of five-time Tour winners. But their rhythms will be disrupted by the sporadic nature of the peaks and such a route could loosen their usual grip on the peloton.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

I don\u2019t think that makes it more difficult to control.\u201d\n\nThen there are riders like Jumbo-Visma\u2019s Primoz Roglic, who will arrive off the back of his Vuelta a Espana triumph, and his new teammate Tom Dumoulin, the 2017 Giro champion. They both have climbing legs and Roglic in particular would fancy an attacking race, but both will wish there were more time-trial kilometres to hurt Bernal.\n\nMore of a wildcard is another home favourite, Thibaut Pinot, perennial underachiever who walked away from this year\u2019s Tour injured and in tears after a freak collision between knee and his handlebars. He had been in prime position to contest for his first much-anticipated maillot jaune and looked in supreme form, so can he mount another assault? The stage 20 time-trial up La Planche, where the winner will be decided, is his home mountain.\n\nVincenzo Nibali has already said he will not race in order to focus on the Olympic road race in Tokyo on 25 July \u2013 the Tour has been brought forward a week to start on 27 June in Nice, ending in Paris on Sunday 19 July \u2013 while Geraint Thomas could be another former champion to miss out. The Welshman is likely to focus on the Giro d\u2019Italia instead, given the depth of competition within his own team.\n\nAs is the way with Ineos these days, Froome and Bernal are likely to start as co-leaders and the road will decide who comes to the fore. Froome posted a friendly selfie of the pair together at the ceremony, but while they are unlikely to engage in open warfare there will be a silent but fierce fight to take charge of the team\u2019s bid.\n\nFroome is nearly back to action after the crash in June which left him in intensive care. \u201cI\u2019m on the road to recovery still,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made it back onto the bike in this last month, which has been fantastic. I\u2019m heading in the right direction.\u201d\n\nOf his leadership bid, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got an amazing line up, an amazing roster of riders to select from. There is nothing decided yet. For me, personally, I have obviously to get myself back to that level before even discussing leadership, or anything like that. At least, for now, everything is going the right direction. I\u2019m optimistic.\u201d", "description": "The memory of the summer\u2019s unpredictable thrills have\u00a0all but washed away in\u00a0the autumn rain, but race organisers seemed to draw\u00a0on what unfolded in\u00a0July as they unveiled a rolling, punchy route\u00a0for 2020.
