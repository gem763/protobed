He demonstratively punched the air toward an official and the resulting technical, like some of the team\u2019s 32 personal fouls, 10 more than the Mavericks, provided an introductory lesson in the league\u2019s new points of emphasis.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were going to call on illegal screens and traveling and offensive charges, push off,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said, listing the areas in which the league has emphasized for more consistent whistles, \u201cbut that\u2019s expected.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards didn\u2019t view their fouls or 17 turnovers as a justification to the loss \u2014 \u201cIf there\u2019s a list of things that didn\u2019t go right for us, that\u2019s way, way, way, way down,\u201d Brooks said Thursday afternoon. Nevertheless, at times the toot of the whistle disrupted their flow in the game.\n\nAD\n\nThere were common fouls like the one assessed to diminutive point guard Ish Smith, who was trying to stop a bigger player from scoring at the rim. But other fouls may take some getting used to for the Wizards, and all NBA players, this season. For instance, early in the fourth quarter, point guard Chris Chiozza briefly wrapped his arm around the leg of a screening offensive player and was called for his fourth personal foul. It appeared as though Chiozza\u2019s act violated the league\u2019s emphasis on \u201cfreedom of movement,\u201d when a defender affects the offensive players\u2019 ability to move without restraint.\n\nAD\n\nAlso, the NBA entered the season with the goal of cracking down on traveling. In the first quarter, the Wizards\u2019 two young centers, Bryant and Moritz Wagner, were penalized for their footwork near the post. Still, the traveling call didn\u2019t upset Bryant nearly as much as the no-call after his rebound later in the game.\n\n\u201cGot a rebound. Got pulled down by three people and they said I was being too flamboyant,\u201d Bryant said, describing his action that resulted in official Jonathan Sterling gesturing back with a 'T' symbol.\n\nAD\n\nBryant received the technical under the \u201crespect for the game\u201d rules, in which a player can be penalized if he makes an overt action in resentment to the call, whether it\u2019s directed toward an official or not. That same rule led to Beal\u2019s disqualification; an unpopular call inside the Wizards\u2019 locker room and on social media.\n\nAD\n\nThey ejected brad for a wave off!?!?!? Wow lol \u2014 Sheldon Mac (@sheldonmacc) October 24, 2019\n\nFinally getting caught up on Bradley Beal's ejection last night & um, that's some serious weak sauce from the refs. If this is the behavior that warrants getting kicked out these days, it's going to be a long season. pic.twitter.com/6rcapNhxY1 \u2014 Michael Lee (@MrMichaelLee) October 24, 2019\n\nSterling was also on the other end of a player\u2019s dispute of a call. With 1:09 remaining in the game, Beal didn\u2019t like being hit with a double tech for his interaction with Mavericks star Luka Doncic and waved his right hand toward Sterling. The wave triggered a second technical foul and an ejection, the second of Beal\u2019s eight-year career.\n\nFollowing the game, lead official Ken Mauer described why the act led to an ejection.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn protest of that call, [Beal] waves him off, which is a respect for the game guideline and a technical foul, an automatic technical foul,\u201d Mauer told a pool reporter. \u201cWe\u2019re taught to give a technical foul, so that was his second technical foul.\"\n\nThe two technical fouls will account for a $4,000 fine. However Beal, who recently signed a two-year, $72 million contract extension, vowed to defend his bank account and told reporters he would contact the league, to dispute further financial punishment due to the ejection. With the new season\u2019s areas of emphasis, it might not be the last time Beal logs a complaint.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs you can tell the refs \u2014 just coming out of preseason, you emphasize certain things \u2026 I guess they called what they saw. I will tell you this: we\u2019re all trying to get into a rhythm, trying to get into a flow to where the game is smoother, quicker and flowing,\u201d said Smith, who has a career average of 1.3 personal fouls per game but was dinged for four against Dallas. \u201cEven us playing, just finding a rhythm, refs finding a rhythm. Dallas finding a rhythm. It wasn\u2019t the most smooth kind of game played.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJordan McRae requires surgery\n\nThe Wizards\u2019 roster was already beset with injuries, and the opener added another name to the list.\n\nOn Thursday, the team announced guard Jordan McRae sustained a fracture in the tip of his right ring finger in the first quarter. McRae, who is right-handed, will undergo surgery Friday and will be reevaluated next week, according to the team\u2019s statement.\n\nAD\n\nMcRae played 23 minutes off the bench against Dallas and finished with 11 points (4-of-9 shooting), five rebounds and three assists in a reserve role behind Beal. With the latest injury, the Wizards have four rotational players on the mend. However, point guard Isaiah Thomas could play as soon as Saturday night when the Wizards take on the San Antonio Spurs to conclude the season-opening three-game road trip. Thomas has spent the last five weeks recovering from left thumb surgery.\n\nAD\n\nAlthough forwards Troy Brown Jr. (left calf strain) and CJ Miles (left foot rehabilitation) have not participated in a full practice, the players are progressing toward a return as well.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Bradley Beal's ejection and Thomas Bryant's technical foul were examples of the NBA's new emphasis on \"respect for the game.\"", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/aBqpWKK_CA8JAh9EaJDMcMGl7Wo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ILBVMRHWAUI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
