As a captain, I feel comfortable that there will be a number of knowledgeable people in the hut who I can rely for advice and guidance.\n\n\"I am not only targeting wins, but also aim to provide opportunities to players to grow in stature and express themselves so that Pakistan cricket can resume its journey to the top.\" (Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)", "description": "LAHORE, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Pakistan have sacked Sarfaraz Ahmed as their captain across all formats, naming Azhar Ali on Friday as the new test skipper and...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
