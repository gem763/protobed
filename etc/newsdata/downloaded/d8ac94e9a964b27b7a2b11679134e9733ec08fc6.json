The crash left six people injured, and Asten was subsequently found guilty on six counts of negligently causing serious injury.\n\nThis afternoon, the Court of Appeal upheld Asten\u2019s appeal of the five year, three month jail sentence he was handed, with one Judge asserting that a \u201csubstantial miscarriage of justice\u201d had occurred.\n\nAsten\u2019s sentence had been slammed as manifestly excessive by his legal counsel and supporters ever since he was handed it a little under one year ago. Despite a clean criminal record prior to the 2016 crash, Asten was given the five-year sentence which carried with a non-parole period of two-and-a-half years.\n\nREAD MORE A Man Dressed As Big Ben Montague St Bridge'd Himself At The London Marathon\n\nIn presenting his appeal, lawyers for Asten asserted there had been a grave misstep on the behalf of the prosecution in failing to declare the existence of the lesser alternative charge of dangerous driving causing serious injury, which carries a far more lenient maximum penalty.\n\nAsten is now set to be re-sentenced by appeals judges on the lower charge, however lawyers for Asten assert he should be released on time already served and placed on a community corrections order.\n\nAppeals judges refused suggestions Asten should be released on bail while his re-sentencing takes place, however he is now being assessed for a CCO, and legal representatives hold strong hope the 55-year-old will be released from jail in time for Christmas.", "description": "Jack Asten, who was driving a coach that crashed into the infamous Montague St Bridge in 2016, has had an appeal of his criminal conviction upheld.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/bus-bridge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
