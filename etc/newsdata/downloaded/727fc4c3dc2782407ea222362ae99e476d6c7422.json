All of the Detroit Three, plus the two Japan-based brands in the fight, want you to know their trucks are over-powered, over-built and over-testosteroned.\n\nListening to them, it\u2019d be easy to believe no one even considers buying a pickup truck without eight-wheel-drive and the capability to tow a house \u2014 not to mention that failing to own a truck at all is virtually unpatriotic.\n\nYour author is a lifelong patron at the Store of Truck, a place where experienced shoppers are adept at sussing out features they want versus the dross simply forced upon the market for the sake of \u201cinnovation.\u201d\n\nWe cast our gaze around the modern pickup truck marketplace and selected a payload of features we feel best represent the useful end of the innovation spectrum.\n\nTailgate Steps\n\nWhen engineers at Ford introduced the tailgate step about ten years ago, other manufacturers were caught flat-footed by its popularity. Instead of innovating their way into the game, some chose to sling mud in the form of derisive commercials, sarcastically labeling the things \u201cman steps.\u201d Their enduring popularity, and the introduction of similar steps from other brands, proved that tack didn\u2019t work.\n\nFord gave its tailgate step a rethink a couple of years ago, tucking the telescopic grab handle inside the \u2018gate and reducing the effort required to unfold the thing in bad weather. GM saw fit to carve toeholds into the corners of its truck bumpers, a feature which first appeared in the early 2000s on its Avalanche quasi-truck. Its GMC brand now incorporates a swing-out grab handle to use with its MultiPro tailgate \u2014 this after years of poking fun at Ford. Hey, if you can\u2019t beat \u2018em, join \u2018em.\n\nWild New Tailgates\n\n\n\nFor the better part of a century, pickup truck innovation focused on raw power and creature comforts. Lately, companies have been investing time and money not to reinvent the wheel, but to reinvent the tailgate.\n\nGMC kicked off the this-ain\u2019t-your-father\u2019s-tailgate movement with the aforementioned MultiPro Tailgate. With six different ways to be deployed, this origami wonder can even be outfitted with waterproof speakers to amp up your next tailgate party.\n\nAt the Ram brand, a barn-door style tailgate has been engineered, allowing drivers to drop the \u2018gate in a traditional fashion or open it up like barn doors in a 60/40 split. This allows one to step closer to the truck box itself, improving access when trying to reach that item which has rolled juuust out of reach up near the cab.\n\nRamBox\n\nSpeaking of Ram, the next innovation is very brand-specific. The aptly named RamBoxes are a pair of lockable storage units residing in the flanks of a Ram pickup bed. Accessible from curbside, they are big enough to store a rifle or collapsed fishing pole, proving that truck-makers do occasionally pay attention to the types of activities in which their typical customer takes part.\n\nIn their current iteration, RamBoxes can be locked and unlocked with the truck\u2019s key fob; are illuminated for easy night access; and have a drain plug in the bottom for evacuating water after using the Rambox to store beverages.\n\nOther brands have made attempts to replicate this success, with varying results. Nissan offers a storage solution of similar ilk, albeit one that is removable and only accessible from inside the box. This is good in terms of it not being easily accessed by nefarious passersby, but renders it useless if the owner fits a tonneau cover.\n\nTowing Cameras\n\nYour author is not ashamed to admit it took him the better part of a summer to get comfortable towing the family camper, one which spans nearly 40 feet in length. That time frame would probably have been significantly shortened if towing cameras were the norm, rather than the exception, back in 2010.\n\nAll brands have some form of backup camera, allowing easier solo hookup of truck and trailer. GM has recently been crowing about its phalanx of coverage, from cameras under the sideview mirrors looking down the truck flanks; to a trailer-mounted cam that keeps an eye on what\u2019s astern.\n\nRam incorporates its optional air suspension into the mix, permitting low-speed reversing in its lowest setting so when the ball and pintle are aligned, the truck can raise and two can be married without having to exit and crank a handle on the trailer\u2019s tongue jack.\n\nBackup Assists\n\nFord, with the help of a QR-style sticker and a bit of programming, has figured out how to relieve the ignominy of getting all crossed up when reversing a trailer. Instead of sitting in the driver\u2019s seat and trying to remember which way to turn the wheel in order to fit your 40-ft camper into a tight spot, the Pro Trailer Backup Assist uses maths and the truck\u2019s electronic steering to help avoid an aneurysm.\n\nArmed with the length of the trailer and the distance of the axles from the tongue, a computer figures out the location of trailer\u2019s corners and pivot point. With that information, it permits the driver to simply turn a large dial in the same direction as they want the trailer to turn.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to the \u201cturn left to go right\u201d advice given to those just learning how to back up with a trailer. Drivers have to modulate the brakes and throttle, but the electronic steering will follow the commands you crank into that dial.\n\nPeering down the side of your car to look for vehicles in a blind spot and then warning of impending doom is not a new feature. What is new is the ability for some trucks to consider the length of the trailer you\u2019re hauling into its warning calculations. After all, if the end of your trailer is 40 feet astern, changing lanes requires that much extra space (or more, if you\u2019re like your author).\n\nInputting the correct trailer length is critical here, as that is the major line of data with which the truck\u2019s systems will work to illuminate the blind-spot monitoring light when appropriate. Still, be sure to check yer mirrors before cranking the wheel.\n\nOff-road Cameras\n\nIt\u2019s good advice to never go off-roading alone, especially if you\u2019re heading into an unfamiliar area. However, one\u2019s buddy may not always be available to spot you going over that obstacle, as they may be a mile or so behind or dealing with some sort of calamity of their own. That\u2019s where these cameras come into play.\n\nGazing forward from its perch in the truck\u2019s grille (generally hidden in the grille badge; look closely the next time you see one) the camera can let the driver know what\u2019s going on a foot ahead of their front bumper much better than can simply craning one\u2019s neck to peer over a truck hood. These cams make it much easier to properly place a wheel before giving it the beans.", "description": "This list of features you'll want on your next half-ton include tech you might not have even known existed", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/dsc_5141.jpeg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
