They were calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment because they believe the accusations of sexual misconduct from Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick are credible.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), a freshman who is part of \"The Squad,\" was one of the speakers. Telling the crowd she is a survivor of sexual assault, she said , \"Kavanaugh may have that seat \u2014 for now \u2014but what you, what we are fighting for is so much bigger than one insecure man blinded by his privilege.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaker after speaker spoke about how the investigation into the allegations was a \"sham\" and a new investigation into Kavanaugh is needed. Kavanaugh has denied all of the accusations against him.\n\nMike Davis, who was the chief counsel for nominations to the Senate Judiciary Committee during Kavanaugh's confirmation, told Townhall the protesters claim of a \"sham\" investigation is not true.\n\n\u201cMore than 40 staff members from then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley\u2019s team worked around the clock to investigate all six allegations of decades-old sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh,\" Davis said. \"Chairman Grassley\u2019s team interviewed 45 individuals and took 25 statements, and the Committee took public testimony under oath from Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. This is all detailed in Chairman Grassley\u2019s 414-page summary report issued on November 2, 2018.\"\n\nJulie Swetnick, who was represented by Michael Avenatti when she accused Kavanaugh, was present at the protest. When introduced, the crowd chanted, \"We believe you!\"\n\nJulie Swetnick, who was represented by Michael Avenatti when she accused Kavanaugh, is here and the crowd chants at her, \"We believe you!\" pic.twitter.com/7ftAevGGSo \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 6, 2019\n\nThen-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley referred Swetnick and Avenatti to the Justice Department in 2018 for potentially conspiring to provide materially false statements to Congress and obstruct a congressional committee investigation.\n\nOnce the speakers were finished, the protesters moved into the street in front of the Supreme Court, blocking traffic. They wrapped themselves and light-poles with customized caution tape while chanting, \"Impeach the motherf**ker!\"\n\nAs more anti-Kavanaugh protesters are blocking the street, they're chanting \"Impeach the motherfucker!\" pic.twitter.com/5ciuDgTst4 \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 6, 2019\n\nThe protesters then decided to march to what they claimed was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's Washington, D.C. home, where they wrapped the customized caution tape and left their signs right outside.\n\nThis is what anti-Kavanaugh protesters have left outside of McConnell's home. pic.twitter.com/AnyqezPIdT \u2014 Julio Rosas (@Julio_Rosas11) October 6, 2019\n\nFord's accusation against Kavanaugh has come under more scrutiny after her friend Leland Keyser doubts the alleged incident took place. Keyser told New York Times reporters she does not believe Ford's claim anymore and told the FBI she felt pressure from Ford's allies to change her story.\n\n\"After these investigations by the Senate and the FBI, there was no corroborating evidence for any of the six allegations,\" Davis said.\n\nHe added how it is ironic how the \"#MeToo mob that opposed any and all of President Trump\u2019s 25 potential Supreme Court nominees \u2014 even before he picked Justice Kavanaugh \u2014 is now complaining about the diligent, thorough, and comprehensive investigations of the six late-breaking allegations against Justice Kavanaugh of decades-old sexual assault.\"", "description": ".10/07/2019 15:59:03PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Guy Benson", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/280/0c94c238-4c9e-4c9d-877a-c47caae015ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
