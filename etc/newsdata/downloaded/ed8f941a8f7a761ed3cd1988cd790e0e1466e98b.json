(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY)\n\nOver the past seven years, I\u2019ve watched my business, SquareFoot, a commercial real estate company that helps other growing companies find their next office space, grow from a handful of people in a cramped space to more than 50 employees filling rows of desks at our new offices.\n\nWe liked our old space in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, but we outgrew it. We moved to our new spot, nine blocks north, at the end of April, to better accommodate the team now and long-term.\n\nMy consistent aim throughout all of this growth has been that I remain at the center of the organization. I\u2019ve entrusted valuable executives and employees to help expand our business \u2013 and they report back to me what I need to know \u2013 yet I remain curious about what\u2019s happening throughout the office. So I made the decision to sit where the team is \u2013 right in the middle of the office.\n\nThis was a decision I made well before I was even the CEO of my own business, after seeing early on in my career a senior manager who sat on the floor with the rest of the employees. The form of leadership had a big impact on me, and I decided then that when it was my turn to lead a team, I'd go that direction.\n\nPrivacy? What privacy?: Wisconsin workers embedded with microchips\n\nWhen we were a smaller team in tighter quarters, the impact of this decision was harder to measure. But since we got our bigger space a few months ago, with more room to spread out, I've noticed more people are coming by to see me and ask me questions as they go about their days. I am thrilled when my employees come seek me out.\n\nThis practice has paid dividends. It helps me understand the day-to-day activity of our business. For instance, we have a team of brokers actively working on deals on behalf of their clients. Since every deal is different from the next, they will occasionally have questions about how to handle a negotiation or a specific need. If I were off in my own world, I doubt they'd come search for me. But once they spot me sitting nearby, they are more likely to come over.\n\nI\u2019ve been working in the commercial real estate industry for over a decade, and I\u2019m happy to be able to help junior members of the team find their footing. Providing mentorship to them is important to me, and I\u2019m always open to opportunities, when I\u2019m asked, to chip in or chime in.\n\nAffordability crisis: Black households can afford just 25% of homes for sale, down from 39% in 2012\n\nThe challenging part is making sure that I convey accessibility and that I am approachable to my staff, and that nobody perceives me as the principal listening in or watching close by. That\u2019s not a simple task. I attend company social events such as monthly happy hours and our book club so the team knows I\u2019m invested. I view the location of my desk as an extension of my commitment to making myself one of the many people who work here.\n\nOther CEOs might be concerned with the lack of privacy from sitting so centrally. For me, working on confidential matters can be easily resolved by either booking a conference room or working remotely. It\u2019s not a huge sacrifice to make on behalf of my employees, and my team appreciates the effort I put in to ensure I am available to them as much as possible. People drop by my desk, say hello in passing, and it all feels much more natural.\n\nI feel like somebody's watching me: Don't look now, but your boss is probably spying on your work phone or computer\n\nIn addition to valuable business information I get through organic conversations, I\u2019ve found that I\u2019ve gotten to know my team better than I would have otherwise. I want my team to take their work seriously, but I also want them to be comfortable being themselves. And I believe that starts with me and where I elect to sit.\n\nJonathan Wasserstrum is the Founder and CEO of SquareFoot, a commercial real estate company headquartered in New York City.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/2019/10/16/boss-day-2020-where-should-boss-sit/3855377002/", "description": "New York real estate CEO Jonathan Wasserstrum says the boss should sit with employees.", "authors": ["Jonathan Wasserstrum", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
