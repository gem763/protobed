Her killer, Thomas Mair, shouted \"Britain First\" \u2014 the name of a far-right group \u2014 as he carried out the attack.\n\nIn the House of Commons on Wednesday, Tracy Brabin, who was elected in Cox's constituency in Yorkshire after the murder, urged the prime minister to moderate his language \"so that we will all feel secure when we're going about our jobs.\"\n\nJohnson replied that \"the best way to honor the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\"\n\nThe prime minister also told Labour's Paula Sheriff, who called on him to stop using language such as \u201csurrender,\u201d \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cbetrayal\u201d in relation to Brexit, that he had \"never heard such humbug in all my life.\u201d\n\nJohnson was speaking during an often bad-tempered debate in the House of Commons the day after Supreme Court judges ruled that his suspension of parliament was \"unlawful.\"\n\nThe prime minister was roundly condemned for his words. Cox's husband Brendan said on Twitter he felt \"a bit sick at Jo's name being used in this way.\"\n\nFeel a bit sick at Jo\u2019s name being used in this way. The best way to honour Jo is for all of us (no matter our views) to stand up for what we believe in, passionately and with determination. But never to demonise the other side and always hold onto what we have in common. \u2014 Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) September 25, 2019\n\nJo Swinson, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said Johnson was \"a disgrace\" for his comments while Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was \"a gaping moral vacuum where the office of prime minister used to be.\"", "description": "British prime minister branded \u2018a disgrace\u2019 for comment about murdered MP.", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169762529-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
