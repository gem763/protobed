Increasing fines for other offenses is also reportedly under consideration, but the tampering talk is obviously notable after the past few months.\n\nThe proposed tampering fines reportedly double the current limit. An unauthorized deal with a player could also reportedly cost teams $6 million, while \u201cstatement or conduct detrimental to the NBA\u201d could cost $5 million, up from a current $1 million. Draft pick forfeitures, suspensions, voiding contracts and bans from hiring a tampered employee could be on the table, as well.\n\nPer ESPN, the NBA wants to increase its fines to reflect a 600 percent increase in league revenue and 1,100 percent increase in franchise value since the maximum fines were last touched in 1996. Incredibly, such fines have stayed in the same place, despite every team hitting more than $1 billion in value.\n\nThe matter will be decided by a vote from the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors on Sept. 20. Also reportedly under consideration are rules that would prohibit players from inducing other players under contract to request trades and would make it mandatory for teams to report within 24 hours if a player or agent requests unauthorized benefits.\n\nAnthony Davis got fined $50,000 for tampering last season. Teams could be paying much, much more in the future.

Kawhi Leonard and Paul George turned the Los Angeles Clippers into instant contenders, but only after some reported recruiting by Leonard. Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving teamed up on the Brooklyn Nets after what seemed like months of planning while under contract with other teams.\n\nIt was an offseason in which it looked like players could choose to force their way to a bigger-market team within a moment\u2019s notice, not caring about light tampering penalties. That probably had to be addressed if the NBA wanted to make it seem like building and maintaining a long-term contender was still possible for smaller teams.\n\n\"I think the consensus at both our committee meetings and the board meeting was that we need to revisit and reset those rules, that some of the rules we have in place may not make sense,\" NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in July. \"I think that's what we discussed. I think it's pointless at the end of the day to have rules that we can't enforce. I think it hurts the perception of integrity around the league if people say, 'Well, you have that rule and it's obvious that teams aren't fully complying, so why do you have it?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt appears the NBA is working to change the answer to that last question in the future.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "It was an offseason of eyebrow-raising deals for the NBA.
