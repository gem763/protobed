(Heidi Gutman/Walt Disney Television)\n\n\u201cThe View\u201d returned to ABC for another season Tuesday morning, resuming a narrative that has carried over from the past two: Meghan McCain, the talk show\u2019s most prominent conservative voice, sparring with her liberal co-hosts over the latest hot-button issue, often igniting the public\u2019s fury as well.\n\nUp first for Season 23? Assault weapons.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg began by pointing out that the gunman who killed seven people and injured 23 others in West Texas over the weekend acquired the military-style rifle he used through some sort of loophole. (Authorities said Monday that the man, who did not go through a background check to obtain the rifle, should not have had the gun at all.) Joy Behar claimed that, despite a large majority of Americans favoring universal background checks for gun purchases, Republican lawmakers would not act to close such loopholes because \u201cthere\u2019s too much lobbying\u201d from the National Rifle Association.\n\nAbby Huntsman, a former Fox News host who joined \u201cThe View\u201d last season and considers McCain a close friend, noted that such acts of violence have \u201cbecome the new normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter the Sandy Hook shooting, when 20 children, amongst others, were killed,\u201d she continued, \u201cI thought, \u2018If nothing\u2019s going to happen after that, I\u2019m not sure what it\u2019s going to take.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe conversation continued this way for a bit, until McCain spoke up as the self-proclaimed \u201cchick on the panel that spent most of her break shooting.\u201d After suggesting that the news media assign more journalists to cover guns specifically, she admitted that, as a lifetime member of the NRA, even she has issues with how the organization chooses to spend money. (This criticism, however, was assigned to chief executive Wayne LaPierre\u2019s wife using donor money to travel with her hair and makeup team.)\n\nIt took Behar saying that voting for the Republican Party guarantees a lack of assault weapon legislation for McCain to make the most incendiary comment of the discussion.\n\n\u201cThe AR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America, by far,\u201d she said, citing a widely referenced statistic on sporting rifles. \u201cI was just in the middle-of-nowhere Wyoming. If you\u2019re talking about going and taking people\u2019s guns away from them, there\u2019s going to be a lot of violence.\u201d\n\nAfter Behar interjected to say that they \u201clived without them for many years\u201d after President Bill Clinton signed a federal assault weapons ban in 1994, McCain exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019m not living without guns.\u201d When Sunny Hostin clarified that they meant \u201cthe assault weapons that are killing our children,\u201d McCain responded sarcastically: \u201cI love being virtue-signaled 20 minutes into the show.\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s seemingly perpetual discomfort with her co-hosts\u2019s differing opinions led to rumors in July that she was contemplating leaving \u201cThe View\u201d before this season. The Daily Beast reported that people close to the 34-year-old said she felt \u201cso exhausted and defeated\u201d and like \u201ca caged animal.\u201d A senior ABC employee talking to CNN described McCain as \u201cmiserable.\u201d\n\nABC denied rumors of McCain leaving by stating that the \u201cco-hosts and \u2018The View\u2019 have had an incredible season and we expect them all back for an epic year ahead.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, after Huntsman remarked that she would like to live in a world where she doesn\u2019t fear getting killed in a shopping mall, McCain set the tone for the season to come.\n\n\u201cWell, none of you feel safe! Again, I feel safe that I can protect myself, and I have guns at my house,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes. \u201cAll right, all right. Welcome back.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFrom politician\u2019s daughter to SNL punchline, Meghan McCain has embraced going mainstream\n\nMeghan McCain says SNL parody of her \u2018is a huge pop cultural honor\u2019", "description": "McCain said there would be \"a lot of violence\" if the government tried to ban AR-15-style rifles.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
