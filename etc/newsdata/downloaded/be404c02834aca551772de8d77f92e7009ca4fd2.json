Those came from the upper seats, the seats where I sat in as a kid. Those aren\u2019t the expensive seats. Those are the people seats. So I think that you have this fervor coming. I even saw banners, Veterans for Impeachment. People are upset with this president.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Monday's broadcast of ABC's \"The View,\" the co-host discussed some in the crowd chanting \"lock him up\" at President Donald Trump during game five of the World Series. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/Joy-Behar-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
