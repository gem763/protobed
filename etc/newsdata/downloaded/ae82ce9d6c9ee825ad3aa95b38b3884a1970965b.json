So-called stage 2 involves slowing the output from reservoirs, it said.\n\nSouth Africa is a water-scarce country and recorded the lowest annual rainfall in more than a century in 2015. It battered agricultural output and saw gross domestic product shrink. Spring rains are late and are only expected in December, Sisulu said, adding that dry seasons are getting longer, more intense and more frequent, with rain more difficult to predict.\n\nAverage consumption in Rand Water\u2019s region has surged to 320 liters daily, surpassing the global average of 173 liters, utility Chief Executive Officer Sipho Mosai said.\n\nSisulu will announce a master plan for water in November, she said. Upgrading infrastructure is a high priority, and the country will look at municipally run systems that will recycle as much as 70% of water used, said Dhesigen Naidoo, CEO of the Water Research Commission.\n\n\u201cThe possibility of a water deficit is real by 2030 if we continue using it as we use it now,\u201d Sisulu said.", "description": "Average consumption in Rand Water\u2019s region has surged to 320 liters daily, surpassing the global average of 173 liters.", "authors": ["Ana Monteiro", "Nkululeko Ncana"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9116/a2f8eeee155d44beb4c49a7bb5feebc0.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
