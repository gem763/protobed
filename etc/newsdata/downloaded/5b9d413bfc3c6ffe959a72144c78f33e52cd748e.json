But it is clear to those looking that the battle looks to be over as the trapped monkey falls limp\n\nOnlooker Supattra Pranimit was having a day-trip to the area when she noticed the large group of monkeys.\n\nThe tourist said she felt sorry for the monkey which was clearly dead when the python finally released its grip and slithered away.\n\n'It was touching to see monkeys help his friend from dying but I felt so sorry for them, because they could not have saved their friend,' she said.\n\n'The python killed the monkey then left. I don't think the area was quiet enough for him to try and eat it.'\n\nAn elderly local appears to try and get close as the monkey fights to get free from the python's tight grip - but it is clear that it is a losing battle\n\nThe python eventually slithers off leaving behind the now deceased primate as dozens of other monkeys look on\n\nIt is not clear what kind of python this was, but according to the Thai National Parks website, there are three types of the reptile that are endemic to the Asian nation.\n\nThese are; the reticulated python, the Burmese python and the Brongersma's short-tailed python.\n\nThe reticulated python ( scientific name Python reticulatus) is a species of python that is commonly found in Southeast Asia.\n\nThey are said to be the world's longest snake and among the top three heaviest snake in the world.\n\nLike all pythons the reticulated python is a non-venomous constrictor and is not thought to pose a significant threat to humans.\n\nThe reticulated python ( scientific name Python reticulatus) is a species of python that is commonly found in Southeast Asia\n\nHowever, there have been a number of cases of people killed by reticulated pythons in the past, said the Thai National Parks in its description of the reptile.\n\nThe second species endemic to Thailand, known as the Burmese python (Python bivittatus) is one of the five largest species of snakes in the world.\n\nThis type of python, commonly found near water, but also in trees, are known to reach up to 18ft in length.\n\nA largely docile species they are powerful reptiles that can bite or even kill with its sheer constrictive force.\n\nThe third species, a Python brongersmai, commonly known as Brongersma's short-tailed python is the smaller of the three.\n\nThe non-venomous snake endemic can grow up to 3.2 feet and is most active around dusk and dawn.", "description": "The python can be seen in a video strangling one of the wild monkeys alongside a mountain path in Prachuab Khiri Khan, southern Thailand.
