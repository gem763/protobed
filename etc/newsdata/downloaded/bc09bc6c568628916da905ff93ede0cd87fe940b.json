In his address to the United Nations General Assembly this morning, Donald Trump warned that the era of globalists has failed, and that \u201cthe future belongs to patriots.\u201d Trump warned that the best way to achieve peace is to have each nation keep to its own affairs and respect their neighbors, a slap across the face to the UN:\n\nTrump at U.N.: \"Wise leaders always put the good of their own people and their own country first. The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots.\" https://t.co/LOlwhKc8Ve pic.twitter.com/gcFlZyjQLM \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) September 24, 2019\n\nTo support his claim of the failure of globalism, Trump made China his Exhibit A. Nearly twenty years ago, the rest of the world convinced the US to admit China to the World Trade Organization and grant them favorable bilateral terms in order to incentivize moderation and liberty. How has that worked out, Trump asked \u2014 and then provided the answer. From now on, the US will look toward bilateral agreements that protect our own interests, unless some major reforms take place tout suite:\n\nPres. Trump: \"In 2001, China was admitted to the World Trade Organization. Our leaders then argued this decision would compel China to liberalize their economy and strengthen their protections. \"This theory has been tested and proven completely wrong.\" https://t.co/2s4fkiClWM pic.twitter.com/VT6FzOni45 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) September 24, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump is slamming the World Trade Organization for allowing China to get preferential treatment despite the size of its economy. Trump says that the institution is in need of major reform and that the U.S. will demand those changes. Trump told world leaders at the annual U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday that he will no longer allow other countries to take advantage of America and the international trade system. Trump has long complained that China is classified as a developing nation by the World Trade Organization even though it is the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Trump also says his administration will conclude new trade deals with Britain, Japan and others that are fair and reciprocal. The Republican president says a deal with Japan is close to being finalized and once Britain leaves the European Union the U.S. will negotiate an \u201cexceptional deal\u201d with it.\n\nSoooo \u2026 we probably shouldn\u2019t expect big breakthroughs next month in the US-China trade talks, then? It\u2019s tough to argue with Trump\u2019s conclusions about China and the success of engagement with the Chinese communists. China wants to keep using the WTO as the venue for US trade complaints thanks to that engagement, although by now they know that Trump won\u2019t agree to that and insists on an enforceable bilateral agreement. If the US gets the reforms it wants at the WTO, then even that fig leaf will be removed. Changing China\u2019s ridiculous official status from \u201cdeveloping\u201d to \u201cdeveloped\u201d will require it to comply with many more regulations, including environmental restrictions that shackle other WTO members.\n\nThat\u2019s more the trees, though, rather than the forest. Trump\u2019s speech declares a sea change in the international diplomatic system that emerged from the destruction of World War II. The consensus after two massive global conflicts was that a closely structured international order would prevent a third world war, and that multilateral trade organizations would spread wealth and liberalize nations. Those assumptions produced a mixed track record, but the catalyst for backlash might be more related to the growth of these voluntary multilateral organizations into supernational governments that intrude on sovereignty, overriding subsidiarity even on a national level.\n\nRejecting the latter makes some sense, even if the exit ramps from them might not be well designed in some cases (especially Brexit, where they\u2019ve barely been considered). Is it wise to throw out the baby with the bath water in terms of security arrangements and multilateral alliances? Trump didn\u2019t actually make an explicit call for that, but his attack on \u201cglobalists\u201d didn\u2019t offer a lot of hints as to the potential for a modest retrenchment back to the original post-WWII models either.\n\nFor most of his speech, Trump\u2019s tone was restrained, perhaps to contrast to his sharp message of rejecting the globalist direction. It won\u2019t be seen as one of his best-delivered speeches, but it could be his most momentous.\n\nNote: I\u2019ll have more on Trump\u2019s remarks on illegal immigration, which rate a separate thread.", "description": "\"The future belongs to patriots.\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/trump-un-globalists.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
