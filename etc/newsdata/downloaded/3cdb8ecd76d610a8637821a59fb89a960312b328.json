They are preoccupied, in a word, by precedent. At the heart of any precedent is the belief that once acknowledged, it is actionable. A historical precedent offers not only a pattern but also a promise. We are assured by a rule \u2014 given what has preceded, here is how we must proceed \u2014 and reassured by a pledge: If we act rightly, we will be around to act again.\n\nThe Athenian writer Thucydides is often considered the father of scientific or objective history \u2014 the sort of history, in other words, pregnant with precedent. Modern scholars have described Thucydides\u2019 account of the decades-long Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta toward the end of the fifth century B.C.E. \u2014 a struggle that ultimately spelled the decline and fall of both city-states \u2014 as a model of realism. Not only did Thucydides tell it like it was, but his telling also served as a blueprint for our own time.\n\nThe relevance of Thucydides seemed particularly great at the arrival of the Cold War. What better reflection of the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union than that between Athens and Sparta? In one corner, a maritime and open society; in the other corner, a landlocked and closed society. In 1947, Secretary of State George Marshall claimed that Thucydides\u2019 history offered the means to think \u201cwith full wisdom and deep convictions\u201d about current affairs. A half a century later, the political theorist Graham Allison argued in an article that we still live in a world according to Thucydides, but with China now taking the role of Communist Russia.\n\nTwo decades later, in his 2017 book \u201cDestined For War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides\u2019s Trap?,\u201d Allison asserts that the Greek historian provides a timeless rule \u2014 that war is more likely than not when a rising power challenges an established power. Allison thus seems to suggest the existence of apparently unchanging laws, first revealed by Thucydides, that \u2014 like Newton\u2019s laws for physical matter \u2014 govern relations between great powers regardless of place and time.", "description": "The idea we can avoid the mistakes of the past is misguided.", "authors": ["Robert Zaretsky"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/opinion/16Stone-zaretsky1/16Stone-zaretsky1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
