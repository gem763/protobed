That\u2019s because 26 of the 46 charging stations currently being built along the transcontinental Trans-Canada Highway are V3 chargers, Tesla tells The Verge.\n\nThe new V3 chargers are capable of charging some Model 3s at rates of up to 250kW, making it possible to gain 75 miles of range in just five minutes. So far, the company has opened just a few other V3 Supercharging stations (including one in Las Vegas) beyond the original one at the Fremont plant.\n\nThe news comes as Tesla celebrates the seven-year anniversary of the first Supercharger stations this week. In the time since the company lit up those first fast chargers back in 2012, Tesla has gone on to build out one of the biggest networks of EV chargers in the world, with 14,081 Superchargers across 1,604 stations in 36 countries.\n\nThe average Supercharger session puts about 35kWh worth of energy back into a customer\u2019s battery pack\n\nTesla tells The Verge it\u2019s seen more than 30 million charging sessions on its fast chargers since the first one was debuted in 2012. The company says its Supercharger network handles an average of 64,000 sessions per day, and doles out a total of about 2.25GWh of energy per day \u2014 meaning users take on about 35kWh of energy during an average charging session.\n\nDepending on the model, Tesla\u2019s vehicles have battery capacities that range between 50kWh to 100kWh. While there\u2019s an obvious psychological appeal to recharging your car to completely full (just like you\u2019d refill a combustion engine car\u2019s gas tank all the way), the numbers Tesla provided imply that a great deal of customers only charge up enough to get where they\u2019re going. Whether that\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to wait for a full charge, or because they\u2019re happy enough to just grab a few extra miles before heading home to finish filling the battery over night, is unclear.\n\nTo put some of these numbers in some context, ChargePoint \u2014 which controls one of the most widely distributed charging networks in the world \u2014 has more than 1,476 fast chargers around the world and 100,700 chargers in total, according to its most recent monthly fact sheet. The California-based charging company says it has powered more than 62,879,120 charging sessions in the 12 years since it was founded.\n\nBut since the overwhelming majority of ChargePoint\u2019s chargers are of the slower Level 2 variety, the company\u2019s network has delivered just 563,125MWh worth of energy over that time \u2014 the same amount Superchargers put out in about 250 days. Based on those numbers, the average charging session over ChargePoint\u2019s existence is closer to 9kWh.\n\nOther comparisons are hard to make. When asked, EVgo was only able to share the number of charging stations on its network, and Volkswagen\u2019s Electrify America said \u201cwe don\u2019t provide usage data.\u201d\n\nMusk once promised Superchargers would be solar-powered and fully off-grid\n\nTesla may have outpaced other charging networks across the last seven years, but like a number of the company\u2019s efforts, the original vision was even more grand. In the 2012 blog post announcing the first Superchargers, Tesla promised the ability to drive \u201canywhere in the country on pure sunlight for free.\u201d\n\nThe company also said it wanted to outfit Superchargers with solar panels from SolarCity (which at the time was still a few years away from being acquired by Tesla), with the goal of \u201cgenerat[ing] more energy from the sun over the course of a year than is consumed by Tesla vehicles using the Supercharger,\u201d resulting in \u201ca slight net positive transfer of sunlight generated power back to the electricity grid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this day will actually go down as being quite historic, I think at least on par with SpaceX docking with the Space Station earlier this year,\u201d CEO Elon Musk said at the 2012 unveiling.\n\nOf course, free Supercharging eventually went away, only reappearing from time to time as an incentive for new buyers. Only about six of the stations were hooked up to a solar panel setup in 2017, and Tesla hasn\u2019t shown off a fully off-grid Supercharger setup. There are a few more stations with solar panels, but it\u2019s clear Tesla\u2019s still a long way off from fulfilling the picture Musk painted back in 2012.\n\nStill, Tesla\u2019s Superchargers tend to excel at the two things that matter most: reliable coverage and getting as much juice as possible in a short amount of time. Other charging networks (like Electrify America) are coming online, and that will certainly shift the balance in the years to come, especially since they tend to work with multiple makes and models. But by the time they\u2019re built out, there will also be more electric cars on the road to charge. Maybe by then, stats like charging time and coverage maps will matter a little bit less than they do today.", "description": "Seven years after Tesla\u2019s Supercharger was unveiled, the company says the fast chargers have been used more than 30 million times, and that they collectively dole out 2.25GWh of energy per day.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cihdBxeQAnc8BJXozhHUXtTpGXI=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19235994/tesla_supercharger_3017.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
