Trump says US \u2018never committed\u2019 to Syrian allies, but SecDef says Washington still committed to oil", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump has said that the US never committed to the security of Kurds in northern Syria, ahead of the end of the Turkish ceasefire. His defense secretary meanwhile says the US troops had a job to \u201csecure the oil.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never gave a commitment to the Kurds,\u201d Trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting on Monday. While the presence of US troops in northern Syria guaranteed the safety of Kurdish militias operating there, Trump defended his decision to pull the troops out, and even appeared sympathetic to the Turkish argument that these militias are \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to look both ways,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cPlenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their borders,\u201d he added, repeating his assertion that the Kurds are \u201cno angels.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018America is running away\u2019: Irate Kurds pelt withdrawing US forces with vegetables (VIDEO)\n\nTurkey\u2019s military operation against the Kurds, dubbed \u2018Peace Spring,\u2019 was launched following the withdrawal of a small number of US troops stationed in the region. Amid international backlash, Trump insisted that protecting the Kurds was not the job of the US, but also threatened Turkey with economic sanctions if the operation continued.\n\nThe operation was paused last Thursday for five days to give the beleaguered Kurds a chance to withdraw from Turkey\u2019s planned \u2018safe zone\u2019 along the border. The peace has been a fragile one, however, with both sides accusing each other of breaking the truce. Nevertheless, Trump told reporters on Monday that \u201cthe ceasefire\u2019s holding.\u201d\n\nThe initial withdrawal on October 9 was followed by reports that hundreds of Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) prisoners had escaped from Kurdish prison camps amid the chaos of the Turkish incursion. Responding to critics on Monday, Trump boasted that it was his administration that oversaw their capture in the first place.\n\nI\u2019m the one who did the capturing. I\u2019m the one who knows more about it than you people or the fake pundits.\n\nThe future of the 1,000 or so American troops in Syria has remained unclear since the withdrawal was announced, and conflicting reports have circulated as to whether some will stay in Syria to protect its oil facilities.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Tickets to the cemetery\u2019 await ISIS fighters if they decide to return to Chechnya from Syria, Kadyrov warns\n\nTrump said on Monday that they will all be removed and deployed elsewhere in the region before eventually coming home. However, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said earlier that some may remain behind to guard Syrian oil fields from possible seizure by IS fighters.\n\n\u201cWe have troops in towns in northeast Syria that are located next to the oil fields, the troops in those towns are not in the present phase of withdrawal,\u201d Esper told reporters in Afghanistan on Monday.\n\nEven if Trump follows through with a complete pullout, some of the troops withdrawn may simply relocate to Iraq.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Come and take it\u2019: Here\u2019s what US troops left behind at abandoned base in Syria (PHOTOS)\n\nMeanwhile, as Trump touts his withdrawal as a move towards ending the US\u2019 \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East, thousands of American troops are preparing to deploy to Saudi Arabia, to guard its oil wealth against perceived \u201cIranian aggression.\u201d\n\nAt the cabinet meeting, the president questioned what US troops were doing on Syrian land in the first place. He had no such qualms about the Saudi deployment, however, as he said that \u201cSaudi Arabia has agreed to pay us for everything we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
