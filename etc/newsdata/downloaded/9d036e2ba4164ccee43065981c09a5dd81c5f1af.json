We decided to try to finalize technical work to prepare this concept for a first test, for a first pilot case in which we can use it: We mentioned the Gulf of Guinea as a first test we could have of this mechanism \u2026. And I want to stress very clearly that it would not substitute, but it would complement and it would be in addition to the traditional military operations that the European Union has and can continue to have in the future.\n\nWhy the Gulf of Guinea?\n\nEarlier in her speech, Mogherini said, \u201c[W]e are seeing growing demand for a European Union role as a maritime security provider not only in our region, but also further away \u2026 where the European Union and the member states have a clear interest in guaranteeing the freedom of navigation and the security of the maritime routes.\u201d\n\nThe Gulf of Guinea certainly needs more robust maritime security. Over the past few years, the Gulf of Guinea has surpassed Southeast Asia and the Horn of Africa as the most dangerous shipping lane. The International Maritime Bureau reported that in 2018, the Gulf of Guinea accounted for all of the world\u2019s six recorded hijackings, 13 of the 18 ships that were shot at, 78 of all the 83 crew members kidnapped for ransom, and 130 of all 141 hostages taken at sea. The bureau believes that these recorded incidences are probably only half of all the attacks that actually happened last year.\n\nThe Gulf\u2019s 3,700 miles of coastline stretches from Angola up to Senegal. \u201c[P]irates have struck across the region, but are primarily a Nigerian problem,\u201d the Economist wrote on June 29. \u201cUnemployment is at least 20 percent, and banditry and oil theft on land are widespread. [T]he largest international association representing shipowners issued a statement in January calling for the EU, America and China to deploy forces to the Gulf of Guinea. [Nigeria\u2019s] armed forces have their hands full with a jihadist insurgency in the northeast, banditry in the northwest, and clashes between farmers and herders in the \u2018middle belt\u2019\u2014all of which are far deadlier than piracy.\u201d Rampant corruption in these countries has exacerbated the problem.\n\nThis is problematic for a region that supplies 10 percent of the EU\u2019s oil. It certainly provides Europe with good reason to get more involved in the region.\n\nBut could there be more to the EU\u2019s Coordinated Maritime Presence than meets the eye?\n\nA Possible Preparation for Hormuz\n\nThe Coordinated Maritime Presence shows how important maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea is to the EU. But how important is maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz to the EU?\n\nIn the past few months, Iran has been harassing and seizing foreign ships in and around the Strait of Hormuz. Through its proxies, it also has been firing at them with armed drones.\n\nBut the EU has been reluctant to confront Iran in a meaningful way, focusing more on its pilot project in the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because it doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize the Iran nuclear deal and also because, as Fondation euractiv noted, \u201cthe EU looks relatively insulated from the incidents in the Strait of Hormuz\u201d thanks to a \u201cmore globally diversified oil market.\u201d\n\nYet when Mogherini was asked during her August 29 press conference about any links between the EU\u2019s Gulf of Guinea plans and Iranian destabilization in the Strait of Hormuz, she said:\n\n[T]he Coordinated Maritime Presence concept \u2026 is not linked to any specific tension, not in particular related to the tensions around the [Persian] Gulf or the Strait of Hormuz, but as an instrument to better coordinate member states\u2019 naval presence in a certain specific area that would be recognized as strategically important for the European Union as such, making the best of the naval national assets in a coordinated European manner. [T]here was a general consensus on the fact that the first pilot case, once the technical preparation is finalized, would rather be a different situation and a different area from the Strait of Hormuz. I would not exclude that that could be an option in the future but, again, it is definitely too early to say that today that could be an option for the European Union to use in that area.\n\nThe EU\u2019s relatively obscure Coordinated Maritime Presence in the Gulf of Guinea could be a part of its preparations for a potential confrontation with Iran in the Strait of Hormuz!\n\nThis prospect is significant because of how it aligns with Bible prophecy. One of the prophecies we reference often is Daniel 11:40: \u201cWhen the end arrives, the king of the South shall butt at him, but the king of the North shall storm at him like a whirlwind, with chariots and cavalry and a large fleet, invading his lands and flooding into them\u201d (Moffatt translation). Radical Islam, led by Iran, is the prophesied king of the south. A Catholic European confederation, led by Germany, is the prophesied king of the north. For proof, please read our free booklet The King of the South.\n\nTrumpet editor in chief Gerald Flurry explains in Germany\u2019s Secret Strategy to Destroy Iran that the word \u201cwhirlwind\u201d in this prophecy actually reveals a military strategy:\n\nThe Germans are excellent war strategists and warriors. They are savvy enough to realize that they will never have peace with Iran. They know that sooner or later, their two religions\u2014their two civilizations\u2014will clash. This scripture describes a time when Germany\u2019s Catholic empire will wage all-out war, throwing everything it has at radical Islam\u2014and dominating it like a violent flood pouring in! Here is the question we need to focus on: How could Germany do this so easily, so effectively and so quickly? Berlin will not be able to overwhelm Iran in the near future unless it is working on a special strategy right now. \u2026 Germany has expected to clash with Iran, and it has been working on a strategy for a decade or more. That strategy is almost complete. \u2026 The king of the north couldn\u2019t come like a whirlwind unless it surrounds Iran and its allies. That is being meticulously planned right now! Germany is busy preparing to execute a whirlwind strategy to rush upon and overflow Iran.\n\nGermany and the European Union are not only surrounding Iran and making intelligent, strategic deployments around Iran\u2019s sphere of influence, they are also establishing mechanisms that will prepare them for a future, inevitable clash with Iranian terrorism.\n\nKeep your eye on Europe\u2019s engagements in the Middle East and its operations in places farther away\u2014like the Gulf of Guinea. What you\u2019ll see might be some of Europe\u2019s final preparations to perfect its strategies for a spectacular clash prophesied in the Bible.
