I'm not much of a gamer, I let them get on with it, but there's a lot of FIFA and Fortnite going on.\n\n'Football is not going to go on forever.\n\n'When I retire \u2014 or God forbid get an injury \u2014 then I have something I'm working towards and that can stand me in good stead for the future.'\n\nThe 21-year-old revealed that he spends around eight to 10 hours a week studying for a business management degree at the Open University.\n\nHe said: 'I'm reading leadership in business, that's the current topic.
