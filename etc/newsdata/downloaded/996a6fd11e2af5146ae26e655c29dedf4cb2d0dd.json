Through the course of four panels, they encounter universal situations and participate in human traditions, but describe them as a foreign being would, to jarring effect. A surprise party becomes a group of people yelling, \u201cWe deceived you!\u201d; a being tucking in its offspring into bed tells it to, \u201cImagine pleasant nonsense.\u201d The dialog takes a moment to be deciphered, but once it\u2019s translated, makes you realize how odd humans can be.\n\nCalled Strange Planet, the webcomic has amassed 1.6 million followers on Instagram since it launched in early February (it had 1.3 million when I started writing this story). To someone who\u2019s not familiar with creator Nathan Pyle\u2019s work, that sounds like the doings of an algorithm gone into overdrive, but Strange Planet is actually the culmination of a decade of making art for the internet. Chances are, you\u2019ve probably seen, or even worn, some of Pyle\u2019s artwork without realizing it.\n\n\u201cI love, love diving into really specific, explicit social behavior and norms,\u201d Pyle, who is a friend and former co-worker, tells me. For instance: what is there to do, he asks, while people sing to us on our birthday besides stare at them? \u201c[It\u2019s] hard to be a human unless we know all these things.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear why Strange Planet resonates with people. It stars beings without gender or race, meaning everybody can project themselves onto them. They navigate universal situations, shedding light on human behavior that no one understands the reason behind. There\u2019s also no punchline waiting in the last panel; the humor comes from the carefully constructed dialog itself. That means it follows a format that can offer up endless jokes for as long as the English language continues to exist (Instagram analytics confirm the comic has the biggest fan base in English-speaking regions like the US, UK, and Australia). Scientists couldn\u2019t engineer a more shareable webcomic if they tried.\n\nThe idea first hit when Pyle and his wife found themselves questioning their own weird behaviors. \u201cIt all commenced when Nathan and his wife Taylor hid their toaster in the closet before company came over for Taylor\u2019s birthday celebration,\u201c his Patreon explains. That decision \u2014 while usually part of a normally accepted tradition of tidying up, but sounds unusual when presented out of context \u2014 became the first comic of the series.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just about having a good idea, though \u2014 Pyle is smart and strategic about how to get his work seen. It\u2019s a skill he\u2019s been honing for a decade, having started his online art career posting t-shirt designs to Threadless, a platform where communicating a clever, quippy idea quickly is the difference between going unseen and making a shirt that\u2019s loved enough to land on a TV show. (Pyle\u2019s most popular design by far, \u201cI love being around you,\u201d which features a moon and earth spinning around in orbit, made it onto an episode of Community.)\n\nWhen I first met Pyle a few years ago, he had just landed a book deal and a job at BuzzFeed off the success of a viral Reddit post. The post included a series of charming GIFs depicting how to survive living in New York City, with tips like \u201cbeware the empty train car, it\u2019s empty for a reason,\u201d which he picked up while getting to know the city as a transplant from Ohio.\n\nMaking something go viral requires preparation. For his Reddit post, Pyle had a plan going in, he later explained on BuzzFeed. He decided on posting 12 GIFs because \u201cthe internet loves a good series of images,\u201d and he made sure to put his name on each GIF so publishers could find him. \u201cIt has to be on every single image because they WILL get separated on the internet,\u201d Pyle wrote. The drawings also got him noticed by HarperCollins and became the basis for a book, NYC Basic Tips and Etiquette, which turned into a New York Times Best Seller.\n\nNew York is the inspiration behind much of Pyle\u2019s work, and he credits the city for being an endless source for visual gags. When Instagram Stories launched, he used a feature that allows text and emoji to be pinned in videos, placing them on pigeons he would observe on the sidewalk. He pinned imagined dialog to them and gave them little emoji briefcases, which would follow the pigeons as they waddled around. And thus, Pigeon Stories was born.\n\n\u201cVideotaping the pigeons allowed me to think, \u2018how do two living organisms interact?\u2019 So you have these observations that you can really translate into comics,\u201d Pyle says.\n\n... and they suddenly\n\nstart walking sometimes as if\n\nthey forgot something pic.twitter.com/u0tkQbyMHl \u2014 Nathan W. Pyle (@nathanwpyle) July 30, 2018\n\nPigeon Stories attracted some media attention, and Pyle spun it out of his personal Instagram account to give the series its own home at @PigeonsByNathan. It\u2019s one of six Instagram accounts he\u2019s made, but not all of them have been hits. There\u2019s one for 99 Stories I Could Tell, a doodle book he released with HarperCollins last year. He also spun off a character named Dolphlock Bones (a play on Sherlock Holmes, but with a detective dolphin) into an account that made it two posts before Pyle moved on.\n\nAll of this \u2014 the T-shirts, as well as the people and pigeons of New York \u2014 feels like it\u2019s led up to the moment that Strange Planet landed in our feeds. So given his prolific career, I was surprised to learn that Pyle didn\u2019t study art, but instead went to theology school. After graduating, he considered going to seminary like his father. The online classes didn\u2019t hold his attention, but he still enjoyed the big philosophical questions they asked.\n\nAw yes! I drew that shirt design. RT @threadless ... thanks for sportin' so much Threadless, Abed (@dannypudi)! ... pic.twitter.com/GAbmWSfjN1 \u2014 Nathan W. Pyle (@nathanwpyle) June 2, 2015\n\n\u201c\u2018What is existence? What is real?\u2019 All that is the base level of any joke,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy do we think something is important and something else is less important? That\u2019s really what Strange Planet plays on.\u201d\n\nPyle is a master at creating things that resonate because he\u2019s hyper-observant by nature. For someone who\u2019s \u201cfascinated by everything,\u201d as he describes himself, everything he observes has the potential to become art.\n\n\u201cPart of my real hope for this is to create a cohesive universe of language that\u2019s fun,\u201d Pyle says. And it looks like he\u2019s on his way to achieving that goal: \u201cI crave star damage\u201d \u2014 the punchline to a comic about sun tanning \u2014 has already become a catchphrase, and #stardamage on Instagram brings up photos of sunburns from people posting their vacations. It\u2019s the kind of real-world impact internet artists dream of, one that transcends the boundaries of a four-panel comic on a screen.", "description": "Nathan Pyle\u2019s Strange Planet webcomic has had a meteoric rise on Instagram, hitting over a million followers in just one month.
