Kim Daniels of Jacksonville filed the bill that would require Florida high school districts \u2014 including public schools \u2014 to offer \u201creligion, Hebrew scriptures and the Bible to certain students as elective courses.\u201d\n\nUnder the bill, the schools would be required to offer the religious courses, but the students would still have the option not to register for them.\n\nWhile the bill would teach about the Bible\u2019s Old and New Testament, the bill says that the optional course \u201cmay not endorse, favor, or promote or disfavor or show hostility toward a particular religion, religious perspective, or nonreligious faith.\u201d\n\nHouse Bill 341 was filed last Friday for the 2020 legislative session. If it were to pass, it would be enacted on July 1, 2020. Ms. Daniels submitted a similar bill in this year\u2019s 2019 session, but it never made it out of the subcommittee phase and thus wasn\u2019t enacted as law.\n\nIndiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Virginia and West Virginia have all introduced similar legislation.\n\nWhile advocates \u2014 including President Trump \u2014 have sung praises for the classes, critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have slammed the bills for jeopardizing \u201cthe separation of church and state.\u201d\n\nMs. Daniels successfully submitted a bill in 2018 requiring all schools and other government buildings to display the motto \u201cIn God we trust,\u201d citing the Parkland school shooting \u2014 where 17 people were fatally shot in 2018 \u2014 as a place that needed God\u2019s \u201clight.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur schools need light in them like never before,\u201d she said, according to WCNC.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
