(PHOTO: Sanjit Das/Bloomberg/Getty Images)\n\nA recent ranking of fashionable countries by CEOWorld magazine placed Singapore at number 13, above South Korea at 16th. But is Singapore really one of the top 20 most fashionable countries in the world?\n\nLooking around the streets of Singapore, checking out the sea of berms and slippers on the MRT, you might not think so, so I reached out to some of Singapore\u2019s top fashion industry people to see what they thought about this possibly dubious ranking.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nThe noise cancelling earphones and headphones you need to bring you into 2020\n\nReview: Is Drunk Elephant skincare as good as they say?\n\nWhy you need to pay attention to Singapore\u2019s developing Art scene\n\nWhat is the definition of \u2018fashionable\u2019 anyway?\n\nDebra Langley is a Singapore-based fashion industry veteran with experience from the top end of the fashion world, down to the most cutting edge of fashion and technology investment and innovation. Her central point about the ranking itself was the source of the information.\n\n\u201cFirst, what is the definition of \u2018most fashionable\u2019? If you are a consumer it will mean stylish or on-trend, but the definition [from CEOWorld magazine] is wrapped up with so many different measures ... \u2018using factors like the number of fashion schools, global fashionistas, perceptions of fashion journalists, affordability, and market size\u2019,\u201d points out Langley.\n\n\u201cI would be more inclined to give this weight if the rating of all these criteria was presented as \u2018country with the highest fashion IQ\u2019, which may or may not relate to how \u2018fashionable\u2019 its population might be considered.\u201d\n\nTop Singapore stylist Randolph Tan was also a bit bemused by the definition. As he pointed out, it was odd that the ranking placed Singapore above South Korea, \u201cwhich has built an international name for its iconic style and multiple fashion brands linked to the K-wave of Kpop and Kdramas\u201d.\n\n\u201cMost \u2018fashionable\u2019 should be determined by originality. When I think of the majority of the Singapore population,I think of t-shirts and jeans or shorts, something that was influenced by American casual clothing, and not really specifically Singaporean,\u201d explains Tan.\n\n\u201cThe source is more focused on technology and financial measures for CEOs and upper management,\u201d points out Ms Evon Chng, one of Singapore\u2019s top editorial and commercial stylists, and founder of digital creative agency Beast.Corp. \u201cThe data is sourced from sales from retail, and I would agree that Singapore fits those criteria to a certain extent for retail fashion.\u201d\n\nHowever Chng\u2019s personal definition of \u2018fashionable\u2019 is less about numbers and shopping, and more about a personal response to dress. \u201cMost fashionable is to have a personal sense of style that makes others want to imitate it,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt could be something novel, does not necessarily be fresh, but rather a look that goes against the grain or hasn\u2019t exactly been popular in the past few years.\u201d\n\nFashionable, then, is more about personal style rather than just following the trends.\n\nSINGAPORE - OCTOBER 13: A model showcases designs by Yoshiki Hishinuma on the catwalk on day 5 of Fashion Week 2013 at the Sands Expo & Convention Centre on October 13, 2013 in Singapore.

Will Singapore become a more fashionable country based on personal style, over retail sales?\n\n\u201cIt is definitely slow, but the Singapore fashion scene is growing with the rise of social media platforms,\u201d says Tan. \u201cYoung Singaporeans are influenced by international styles and the outfits of their favourite style icons, but when it comes to creating a specific \u2018Sing-Fashion\u2019 look, we are a long way away.\u201d\n\nLangley believes that there is a future for Singapore fashion based on the increased use of technology and industry innovation.\n\n\u201cI think the future of the Singapore fashion industry lies in leveraging Singapore's USP, which is a very tech enabled society, a strong startup and investment ecosystem with government support; and also being a gateway to Southeast Asia with a huge population of Gen Z digital natives,\u201d explains Langley. \u201cThere is also established infrastructure and cultural knowledge to support expansion into North Asia, especially into Japan and China, when the time is right.\u201d\n\nStory continues", "description": "A recent ranking of fashionable countries by CEOWorld magazine placed Singapore at number 13, above South Korea at 16th!
