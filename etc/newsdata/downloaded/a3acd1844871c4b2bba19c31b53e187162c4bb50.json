REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will ask Queen Elizabeth to suspend, or prorogue, parliament for a matter of days from next Tuesday to launch its new legislative agenda.\n\nLast week, Britain\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Johnson\u2019s previous suspension of parliament was unlawful after critics argued it was being used to prevent lawmakers from scrutinising his Brexit plans, forcing parliament to reconvene amid angry scenes.\n\nThat suspension had been due to last five weeks.\n\nBut with parliament needing to be prorogued before any new legislative launch, known as a Queen\u2019s Speech, the government has requested a much shorter suspension, meaning it should take place as normal.\n\n\u201cI want to deliver on the people\u2019s priorities,\u201d Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThrough a Queen\u2019s Speech, the government will set out its plans for the NHS (health service), schools, tackling crime, investing in infrastructure and building a strong economy. We will get Brexit done on 31 October and continue delivering on these vital issues.\u201d", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will ask Queen Elizabeth to suspend, or prorogue, parliament for a matter of days from next Tuesday to launch its new legislative agenda.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436533161&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF911FM"}
