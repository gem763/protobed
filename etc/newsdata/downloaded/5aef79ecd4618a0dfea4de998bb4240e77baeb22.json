REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo/File Photo\n\nTehran has denied involvement in the Sept. 14 attacks on oil plants, including the world\u2019s biggest crude processing facility, that initially knocked out half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s production.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want conflict in the region ... Who started the conflict?\u201d Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday, blaming Washington and Riyadh for war in Yemen.\n\nYemen\u2019s Houthi group, an ally of Iran, has claimed responsibility and said they used drones to assault state oil company Aramco\u2019s sites.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and other U.S. officials were headed to Saudi Arabia. United Nations experts monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen also left for the kingdom, Saudi\u2019s U.N. envoy told Reuters.\n\nConcrete evidence showing Iranian responsibility, if made public, could pressure Riyadh and Washington into a response, though U.S. President Donald Trump said he does not want war.\n\nThe Saudi Defense Ministry said it will hold a news conference on Wednesday at 1430 GMT to present \u201cmaterial evidence and Iranian weapons proving the Iranian regime\u2019s involvement in the terrorist attack\u201d. Riyadh has already said preliminary results showed the attack did not come from Yemen.\n\nA U.S. official told Reuters the strikes originated in southwestern Iran. Three officials said they involved cruise missiles and drones, indicating a higher degree of complexity and sophistication than initially thought.\n\nThe officials did not provide evidence or explain what U.S. intelligence they were using for the evaluations.\n\nSome U.S. allies, as well as those of Iran, have asked for proof behind accusations Tehran was responsible for the attack that cut 5% of global production. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, said on Tuesday the 5.7 million barrels per day of output would be fully restored by the end of the month.\n\nOil prices fell after the Saudi reassurances, having surged more than 20% at one point on Monday - the biggest intra-day jump since the 1990-91 Gulf War. [O/R]\n\nIllustrating international caution on such an inflammatory issue, Japan\u2019s new defense chief said Tokyo has not seen any intelligence that shows Iran was involved.\n\n\u201cCOMPELLING\u201d EVIDENCE\n\nA senior U.S. official called for a U.N. Security Council response to the attacks, although success is unlikely because diplomats say Russia and China - who have veto powers - are likely to shield Iran.\n\nOne of the three U.S. officials voiced confidence the Saudi probe would yield \u201ccompelling forensic evidence\u201d determining the origins of the attack that has exposed serious gaps in Saudi air defenses despite billions of dollars spent on Western military hardware.\n\nSaudi U.N. Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi told Reuters the experts monitoring sanctions on Iran and Yemen were heading to Saudi Arabia along with those from a separate independent panel who also report to the Security Council.\n\nFrance is also to send experts in response to a request from Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince.\n\nThe situation could harm French diplomacy meant to avert a feared U.S.-Iranian conflict, diplomats told Reuters after Macron\u2019s top envoy held talks in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out talks with the United States unless it returns to the nuclear accord between Iran and the West that Washington quit last year.\n\nTrump said on Monday there was \u201cno rush\u201d to retaliate and Washington was coordinating with Gulf Arab and European states.\n\nAlready frayed U.S.-Iran ties deteriorated further when Trump quit the nuclear pact and reimposed sanctions, severely hurting the Iranian economy.\n\nWashington and its Gulf Arab allies also want Iran to stop supporting regional proxies, including the Houthis who have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen for four years.\n\nDespite years of air strikes against them, the Houthi movement boasts drones and missiles able to reach deep into Saudi Arabia, the result of an arms race since the Western-backed, Sunni Muslim coalition intervened in Yemen against the group in March 2015.\n\nIran\u2019s clerical rulers support the Houthis, but Tehran denies it actively supports them with military and financial support. In Wednesday\u2019s video carried by Iran\u2019s media, Rouhani said the oil attack was a \u201cwarning\u201d by Yemenis.\n\n(This story was corrected to change Tehran to Riyadh in paragraph 3, and fix a typo in paragraph 6)", "description": "Saudi Arabia said it would show evidence on Wednesday linking regional rival Tehran to an unprecedented attack on its oil industry that Washington believes originated from Iran in a dangerous escalation of Middle East frictions.", "authors": ["Stephen Kalin", "Michelle Nichols", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431146825&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0IZ-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
