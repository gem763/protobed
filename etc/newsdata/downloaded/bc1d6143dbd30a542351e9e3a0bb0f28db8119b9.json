In the US it comes third behind terrorism and affordable healthcare.\n\nNick Lowles, from UK-based anti-racism group Hope not Hate, which commissioned the survey, said the findings showed that the public were \u201cway ahead\u201d of politicians in recognising the scale of the climate crisis. \u201cThey understand the scale of the problem and want governments to take the strong and decisive action that this emergency requires.\u201d\n\nQuick guide Covering Climate Now: how more than 250 newsrooms are joining forces this week to spotlight the climate crisis Show Hide Hundreds of newsrooms around the world are banding together this week to commit their pages and air time to what may be the most consequential story of our time: the climate emergency. As world leaders descend on New York for the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September \u2013 and millions of activists prepare for a global climate strike on 20 September \u2013 the media partnership Covering Climate Now is launching its first large-scale collaboration to increase climate coverage in the global media and focus public attention on this emergency. The Guardian is the lead partner in Covering Climate Now, which was founded earlier this year by the Columbia Journalism Review and the Nation. The partnership currently includes 250 newsrooms representing 32 countries with a combined monthly reach of more than a billion people. The network represents every corner of the media including TV networks (CBS News, Al Jazeera), newspapers (El Pa\u00eds, the Toronto Star), digital players (BuzzFeed, HuffPost, Vox), wire services (Getty Images, Bloomberg), magazines (Nature, Science), and dozens of podcasts, local publishers, radio and TV stations.

The UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has called for heads of government to bring plans \u2013 not words \u2013 to address the climate emergency ahead of a 2020 deadline for countries to raise their national targets under the Paris agreement. The treaty signed in 2015 obliged governments to keep temperatures well below 2C and to strive for 1.5C\n\nThe poll found that most people called for radical measures to cut emissions \u2013 including building more wind turbines and solar panels, providing more charging points for electric cars, and investing to create jobs in clean industries.\n\nThey also wanted governments to be tougher on big polluters and to force them to pay for the damage they caused, although the public are sceptical this would happen, with at least two-thirds suggesting politicians put the interests of big oil and gas corporations before those of local communities.\n\nThe poll also found support for tougher measures to cut emissions, including a halt to coal mining and an end to oil and gas drilling, as well as increased taxes on frequent fliers.\n\nThe findings come just a day before millions of people are expected to take to the streets for the global climate strike. Walkouts and demonstrations are expected in cities on every continent except Antarctica and adults, businesses and trade unions have been urged to join.\n\nLaurence Tubiana, the CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said the findings in the poll underlined the growing support for immediate radical action.\n\n\u201cThis poll reconfirms what the growing numbers of people striking for climate action are saying: We\u2019re worried, we know we can do more, leaders, we need you to step up and unite behind the science.\u201d", "description": "Eight-country poll shows people view climate crisis as priority over migration and terrorism", "authors": ["Matthew Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93082d3324eb867eb8e844084bbd0d9ec37249db/0_72_5762_3459/master/5762.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fa0c4a315b984e4bab29ac0f84180532", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
