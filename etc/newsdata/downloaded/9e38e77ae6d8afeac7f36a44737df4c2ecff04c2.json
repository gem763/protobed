When there is no water, people do not flush toilets that much, which means we get less sewer spillage, but it gets worse in the morning and evening. And so does the smell, which penetrates our houses and invades our dinners. We can live with less water as plans were often made for water to be delivered in trucks, but this smell is something else, and could lead to the whole community becoming sick.\u201d\n\nThe reason for this mess? Corruption, maladministration and incompetence.\n\nThis was then topped off by a R150 million investment in VBS Mutual Bank, which tipped a teetering municipality into full-blown crisis.\n\nThere are hundreds more examples of towns, streets, buildings and other infrastructure that do not come close to living up to the character of the great person after whom they were named.\n\nThere are many more to come.\n\nEkurhuleni recently decided to name a whole batch of streets and community facilities after struggle heroes, including Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and George Bizos.\n\nIn itself, there is nothing wrong with renaming places after those who sacrificed for our freedom.\n\nThe only problem is that it has all been about the party that is currently in power, with little regard for other \u2013 albeit smaller \u2013 strands of the liberation struggle.\n\nBut that\u2019s for another day.\n\nWhat is the purpose of honouring an icon if we proceed to disgrace the name of that person?\n\n\n\nSurely naming a municipality after Tambo should inspire those who run it to live up to his character of selflessness, honesty and servant leadership.\n\nOne wonders what the gangsters of Nelson Mandela Bay think when they concoct schemes in the name of the great man and render the municipality ungovernable in their quest to access the public purse.\n\nDo those who run the Ruth Mompati municipality care that her name is now associated with corruption, putrid smells, disease and VBS theft?\n\nIt is all well and good to want to honour the titans who led our freedom struggle, but it has to mean something.\n\nThere has to be more to renaming things than just a loud sign.", "description": "Turn on the radio in the morning and you will hear the traffic report presenter telling you that the robots are out of order at the corner of this road named after a struggle hero and that road named after another.", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7438/c76bd2495dd54c6b8650f2aef8dd7717.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
