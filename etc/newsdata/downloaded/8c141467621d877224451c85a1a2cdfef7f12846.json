Tectonic plates are composed of Earth's crust and the uppermost portion of the mantle. Below is the asthenosphere: the warm, viscous conveyor belt of rock on which tectonic plates ride. The Earth has fifteen tectonic plates (pictured) that together have molded the shape of the landscape we see around us today Earthquakes typically occur at the boundaries of tectonic plates, where one plate dips below another, thrusts another upward, or where plate edges scrape alongside each other. Earthquakes rarely occur in the middle of plates, but they can happen when ancient faults or rifts far below the surface reactivate. These areas are relatively weak compared to the surrounding plate, and can easily slip and cause an earthquake.\n\n'While many people focus on greenhouse gases made by humans, a huge variety of natural sources also exist,' added paper author Takeshi Tsuji.\n\n'Large-scale gas reservoirs along a rifting axis may represent another source of greenhouse gases that we need to keep our eyes on.'\n\n'Or, they could turn out to be a significant natural resource.'\n\nTo be the latter, the reservoir would need to be filled mainly with methane, which can be used as a fuel, unlike carbon dioxide. At present, the researchers do not know which of the two gases makes up the largest part of the trapped reservoir.\n\nEither way, however, both are greenhouse gases that could have significant environmental impacts if rapidly released into the atmosphere.\n\nThis body of gas may not be alone, the researchers report.\n\n'Zones like the one we investigated are not uncommon along rifts,' said Professor Tsuji.\n\n'I expect that similar reservoirs may exist elsewhere in the Okinawa Trough as well as other sediment-covered continental back-arc basins around the world.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.", "description": "Seismologist\u00a0Andri Hendriyana and colleagues at Japan's\u00a0Kyushu University discovered the sizeable reservoir using seismic pressure waves.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/27/19/19022002-0-image-a-23_1569610463831.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
