the legal process for the UK's departure.\n\nWhile stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson will say it is not too late for Labour to \"win back\" Remain voters from the Lib Dems if it campaigns \"unequivocally\" to remain.\n\n\"My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,\" he will add.\n\n\"They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it.\"\n\nMr Watson will say that, though \"very difficult\", he and many others \"respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time\".\n\n\"But there eventually comes a point,\" he will add, \"when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Trades Union Congress on Tuesday, Sir Keir Starmer will say that another referendum is the only way of \"cleaning up the mess left by the Tories\".\n\n\"And - of course - 'remain' should and will be on the ballot paper along with a credible option to leave.\"\n\nThe Conservatives said Mr Watson had made it clear he wanted to \"cancel\" the 2016 Brexit referendum result.\n\n\"Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will deliver Brexit by 31 October, no ifs or buts, so we can move on and focus on the issues that matter to people,\" said its party chair James Cleverly.", "description": "Tom Watson says another referendum, with Labour backing Remain, can resolve the deadlock.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0A4A/production/_108743620_mediaitem108743619.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
