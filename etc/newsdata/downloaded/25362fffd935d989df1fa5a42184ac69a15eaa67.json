We want employees to speak up if they have concerns and we strive to make it easy for them to do so,\u201d said a Microsoft spokeswoman. \u201cWe take all employee concerns seriously and have a fair and robust system in place to investigate employee concerns and take appropriate action when necessary.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft is not the only company to be accused of systematically underpaying women. In 2017, Google was accused by the US Department of Labor of discriminating against female engineers. Google claims that its own analysis shows no gender pay gap. Google also faces a similar complaint from women who taught employees\u2019 children at the company\u2019s childcare centre.\n\nSixty percent of women working in Silicon Valley experience unwanted sexual advances, according to a 2016 survey. About two-thirds of them say that these advances were from their superior.\n\nHowever, tech workers who complain about sexual harassment and discrimination are frequently gagged by non-disparagement clauses, which can have the effect of shielding serial harassers within the industry.\n\n", "description": "Suit claims world\u2019s largest software firm failed to properly redress 238 internal complaints, including harassment, discrimination and rape", "authors": ["Olivia Solon", "Jane Martinson", "Lizzie O'Shea"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97a044d4d477b5294394bea91846dc84f2c7dbfd/243_89_5313_3188/master/5313.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5f237390f287d26530c624783516b9fa", "published_at": "2018-03-13"}
