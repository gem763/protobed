The crashes claimed the lives of all 346 people on the flights and prompted a series of investigations into the plane's design and certification by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe catastrophes plunged Boeing into one of its biggest crises in its more than 100-year history, costing CEO Dennis Muilenburg his chairman role. On Tuesday, Boeing replaced Kevin McAllister as head of its key commercial airplane unit, which made the 737 Max.\n\nIn July, Boeing took a $4.9 billion after-tax charge to compensate airlines and other customers affected by the grounding.\n\nBoeing said Wednesday, however, that there was \"no significant change to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers related to the 737 MAX grounding.\" Investors appeared to breathe a sigh of relief. Despite a 50% slide in third-quarter profit that missed Wall Street estimates, shares were up 2.7% in premarket trading.\n\nWhile Boeing said it expects regulators to sign off on its fixes to the planes before the end of the year, no U.S. airline has the Max on its schedule until 2020. Southwest, for example, canceled Max flights through early February. It would take at least a month for airlines to retrain Max pilots, get planes out of storage and other steps needed before carriers can add the jets back to their schedules.", "description": "Boeing expects to ramp up production of the planes to 57 a month by the end of next year.", "authors": ["Leslie Josephs"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105831580-1554325068088muilenburg-max-deplaning-on-arrival.jpg?v=1554325213", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
