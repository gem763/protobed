And that is what true luxury is \u2013 things made well, built to last.\u201d\n\nThe 'Oleander' silk duster jacket, $1400, complemented by luscious Tuscan light.\n\nManners designs two collections a year for a small coterie of private clients, in addition to her day job. She sells only through pop-up salons and her own online store, saying she is hesitant to sell in retail spaces she can\u2019t control. For her, it\u2019s more than just selling clothes.\n\n\u201cMy clients work hard, they need a space where they can relax and enjoy the experience. I want to be able to provide that for them.\u201d To that end, she\u2019s hosting a three month pop-up in Sydney\u2019s Double Bay, named Le Marche du Luxe, from October to December.\n\nLast year, Manners hosted a pop-up of an altogether different kind, bringing together some of the women who inspire her most, from floral artist Dr Lisa Cooper to sound artist Claudio, and sending them to Florence, Italy, for a two-week installation showcasing fine art, photography and, of course, fashion. It was a hugely expensive undertaking, Manners says, revealing the final cost under her breath and adding, \u201cIt\u2019s still hurting\u201d.\n\nManners collaborated with Kailis to produce this limited-edition ring. POA. Kailis\n\nBut the gamble paid off, she says, as she made valuable connections with the Italian fashion industry, which will allow her to grow and evolve globally. And \u2013 bonus \u2013 one Florentine local told Manners that her designs reminded her of \u201cearly Pucci\u201d.\n\n\u201cI mean, I can die happy now,\u201d she jokes. \u201cI wanted to do something that was about beauty for beauty\u2019s sake. Because that\u2019s how I lift myself out of the fog, that\u2019s my self-care \u2013 surrounding myself with art, culture, photography. And I think we need that now, more than ever.\u201d\n\nStaging the two-week installation and a lavish gala dinner in Florence has paid dividends for Manners.\n\nAs part of the installation, she collaborated on fine jewellery with the West Australian brand Kailis. \u201cI\u2019ve been a Kailis customer for a long time, I love their products,\u201d says Manners. \u201cAnd as I was thinking about the installation and all the elements I needed, I thought, \u2018I need a ring\u2019. I had the exact design and colours in mind, I knew exactly what it looked like.\u201d The company obliged, and the limited edition ring (POA) is available on Manners\u2019 website.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for quitting her day job, Manners isn\u2019t in a hurry. \u201cI\u2019m on a mission to show people that you can do both: art and corporate work,\u201d she says. She recalls telling a former boss about her desire to work in fashion. \u201cHe said, \u2018Go for it \u2013 just don\u2019t tell anyone.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Stuff that\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe points to the growing use of artificial intelligence in many industries. \u201cThe truth is, AI is coming in doing a whole bunch of work for us. So what separates us from AI? Creativity, connections, problem-solving. Why should I have to choose between my left and right brain?\u201d\n\nWool-blend Tailor jacket, $795 and You Can box-pleat skirt, $850, photographed in Tuscany.\n\nWhen she hires for her own team, Manners looks for people who have hobbies and passions outside the office. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to galvanise that? It shows you can manage your time, that you\u2019re innovative, that you have a deeper and broader understanding of the world. That\u2019s very powerful.\u201d\n\nWhile she admits that there is \u201cprobably an expiry date at some point\u201d on pursuing fashion and finance, \u201cI want to show people you don\u2019t have to choose. You can be a serious business person and be serious about art. We love putting people into boxes but I am over that. If you have a point of view and you want to express it, it shouldn\u2019t matter what else you do.\u201d\n\nNEED TO KNOW\n\nLe Marche du Luxe pop-up runs from October 3 to December 24 at 2/5 Knox Street, Double Bay, Sydney.", "description": "Aneka Manners has no intention of letting her creative side take a back seat to her day job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8167%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_198%2C$y_228/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3cb23d63e39a8dd6e28f1e09f6cdb60c5378f23d", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
