You don\u2019t say stuff unless you have evidence.\n\n\u2018Now, anyone I\u2019ve outed for a reason if they really tried to damage me, for example my best friends when they betrayed me with the husband, course I\u2019m gonna out them, name and shame them\u2026why wouldn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s horrible that Rebekah\u2019s getting all this s***\u2026but I believe, I genuinely believe, that Coleen would not put this statement out unless she had evidence,\u2019 she added. \u2018There must be truth in it. There\u2019s got to be.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe star acknowledged that she also \u2018looked at it the other way.\u2019\n\n\u2018Rebekah \u2013 what would Rebekah gain by doing this?\u2019 she asked. \u2018She doesn\u2019t need the money, it\u2019s not about the fame. She\u2019s got a happy life.\u2019\n\nHowever, she insisted: \u2018Knowing the situation I\u2019ve been in\u2026there\u2019s got to be truth in it,\u2019 and went on to claim: \u2018My verdict is, Rebekah must be guilty. Coleen needs to back [her claims] up and show us.\u2019\n\nKatie wasn\u2019t afraid to weigh in on the drama (Picture: YouTube/Katie Price)\n\nKatie is just the latest celeb to wade into the drama, joining the likes of Danielle Lloyd, Vinnie Jones, and even Avengers star Paul Rudd.\n\nIt truly is international news at this point.\n\nSending the internet into meltdown, Wayne Rooney\u2019s wife recently penned a statement which detailed how she had invented stories (for instance her house getting flooded) to see if they\u2019d made their way to the press.\n\nShe then blocked everyone except for Rebekah\u2019s account from seeing her Instagram Stories.\n\nJamie Vardy\u2019s wife then denied all claims and hit back in her own statement.\n\n\u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe reality star continued: \u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted reps for Rebekah for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
