The magazine said Ottawa's confirmation of Ramli to the post sparked fear and concern within the Syrian community in Montreal.\n\nIn an interview with Maclean's, Ramli described the White Helmets, a volunteer group of first responders and war crime monitors that enjoys the support of the federal government, as a \"terrorist organization'' that supports Al-Qaeda.\n\nThe Maclean's article also says Ramli \"bristled\" at suggestions that he wouldn't treat Syrians equally.\n\nFreeland said on social media that she was \"shocked'' by Ramli's comments and the views \"he has espoused publicly on social media and elsewhere.''\n\nShe says neither she nor her team were aware that Global Affairs officials had approved his appointment and has asked the department to look into it right away.", "description": "Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says she'll look into why Ottawa signed off on a sympathizer of Syrian President Bashar\u00a0al-Assad as that country's honorary consul in Montreal.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5230834.1564518667!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/us-canada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
