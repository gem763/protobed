But she hasn't let that stop her from celebrating and representing her beloved team -- and 2019 Stanley Cup winners -- the Blues.\n\nWhen she rang her treatment bell in May, 100 days after her bone-marrow transplant, she wore a St. Louis Blues headband and the players' numbers on her back.\n\nFor her bell ringing, Laila wore a shirt with #stlblues players' numbers on the back, because \"they had her back the entire time.\" \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99 pic.twitter.com/O3PsHqfOU7 \u2014 St. Louis Blues (@StLouisBlues) May 9, 2019\n\nAt the time, her doctors would only let her leave home to go to treatment at the St. Louis Children's Hospital.\n\nBut later that May, her mother shared some amazing news with her and posted the video on Twitter: Laila would be attending Game 3 of a Blues playoff series and her doctors had given her the green light to go.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" she said through tears in a post on the Blues' Twitter page. \"Will this also be my first playoff game?\"\n\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images, FILE\n\nWhen the team made history in June by winning its first Stanley Cup in the team's 52-year NHL existence by beating the Boston Bruins in Game 7, she was right there -- after they'd invited her to Boston. The players even called her on the ice with them and they inscribed Laila's name on their rings.\n\nBut on Tuesday, they had one more gesture for Laila to show her how much she inspired them and how much they appreciated her: a Stanley Cup ring all her own.\n\nBlues players Alexander Steen and Colton Parayko had the ring with them when they visited Laila at her home.\n\n\"You know how much you mean to us, right?\" Steen said. \"And what an inspiration you\u2019ve been to so many people. So me and Colton are here representing our organization and everybody there and we have something that we would like you to open right now.\"\n\nLaila got emotional as she opened the box and was seen first kissing the ring and then putting it on her finger.\n\n\"Oh, my God,\" she said, wiping away tears. \"I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be touching this right now.\"\n\n\"It's her whole hand,\" said her mother, Heather, laughing.\n\nLaila, floating between laughter and tears, told Steen and Parayko that the ring fit \"beautifully.\"", "description": "Laila Anderson was at Game 7 in Boston when the St. Louis Blues won its first Stanley Cup victory in June.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Sports/laila-anderson-stanley-cup-01-file-gty-jef-191002_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
