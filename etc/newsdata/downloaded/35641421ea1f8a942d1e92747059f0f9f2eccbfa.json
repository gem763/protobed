The company rarely breaks this pattern, and it's usually only for very important security issues.\n\nThis is one of those rare occasions, and Windows users are advised to install today's updates as soon as they become available in their operating system's update section.\n\nThe IE zero-day\n\nOf the two bugs, the Internet Explorer zero-day is the most important one, primarily because it's already been exploited in active attacks in the wild.\n\nDetails about the attacks are still shrouded in mystery, and Microsoft rarely releases such details. What we know is that the attacks and the zero-day have been reported to Microsoft by Cl\u00e9ment Lecigne, a member of Google's Threat Analysis Group.\n\nThis is the same Google threat intel team that has detected the attacks with iOS zero-days against members of the Chinese Uyghur community earlier this year. Those attacks also targeted Android and Windows users; however, it is unclear if the IE zero-day patched today is part of those attacks.\n\nBut what we know now is that IE zero-day is a very serious vulnerability. It is what researchers call a remote code execution (RCE) issue.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, \"the vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\"\n\n\"An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user,\" Microsoft said. \"If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\"\n\nThe attack requires luring an Internet Explorer user on a malicious website, which is a rather trivial task, as it can be achieved by various methods such as spam email, IM spam, search engine ads, malvertising campaigns, and others.\n\nThe good news is that Internet Explorer usage has gone down to 1.97% market share, according to StatCounter, meaning the number of users vulnerable to attacks is rather small, and attacks should be pretty limited in scope.\n\nThe IE zero-day is tracked with the CVE-2019-1367 identifier. In a security advisory, Microsoft lists various workarounds for protecting systems if today's update can't be applied right away.\n\nMicrosoft Defender DoS bug\n\nThe second issue fixed today is a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability in Microsoft Defender, formerly known as Windows Defender, the standard antivirus that ships with Windows 8 and later versions, including the widespread Windows 10 release.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, \"an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to prevent legitimate accounts from executing legitimate system binaries.\"\n\nThe good news is that this bug isn't such a big issue. To exploit this bug, an attacker would first need access to a victim's system and the ability to execute code.\n\nThe bug allows a threat actor to disable Microsoft Defender components from executing, but if the attacker already has \"execution rights\" on a victim's computer, then there are many other ways to run malicious code undetected -- such as fileless attacks.\n\nNevertheless, Microsoft has released update v1.1.16400.2 to the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, a component of the Microsoft Defender antivirus, to fix this issue.\n\nThis bug is tracked as CVE-2019-1255. Microsoft credited Charalampos Billinis of F-Secure Countercept and Wenxu Wu of Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab with discovering this issue.", "description": "Microsoft publishes rare out-of-band security update to address CVE-2019-1367 and CVE-2019-1255.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/04/12/b714186a-6f7b-467e-abac-dd5860a98dfb/thumbnail/770x578/6377c9e33228bbbd7e86a0e4af3bc5b4/internet-explorer-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
