(AP) - More than 12 years since Jessica Miraglia completed the drug-treatment program of Luzerne County Treatment Court, the young lawyer has finally gathered the courage to publicly talk about her journey from being an addict to becoming an attorney.\n\nMiraglia, 32, of Fairview Twp., now serves as one of Luzerne County\u2019s conflict counsel attorneys who represent indigent clients.\n\n\u201cTreatment court is the only reason I\u2019m here, so I adore the program. We need to focus on rehabilitation instead of just punishment,\u201d Miraglia said. \u201cI would love for society to care more about giving people a second chance.\u201d\n\nTreatment court gave Miraglia a second chance. And she is making the most of it, hoping to inspire others to follow her lead.\n\nTwelve people were to graduate last week from the Luzerne County Treatment Court program, which serves as an intensive probation sentence for first-time, non-violent offenders who want their records expunged.\n\nMiraglia, who used cocaine, ecstasy and abused prescription pills like xanax, said she\u2019s been sober since entering treatment court in June 2006.\n\nAfter completing the program in 12 months, Miraglia went on to get degrees in criminal justice from Luzerne County Community College and King\u2019s College and graduated at the top of her law school class at Widener University - all as a single mother.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great story,\u201d said attorney Vito DeLuca, who has been an advocate for and mentor to Miraglia ever since she walked into his office at age 18 after being hit with felony drug-dealing charges by state prosecutors.\n\nDeLuca said Miraglia was arrested as part of a bust named \u201cOperation Family Ties\u201d for frequenting a childhood friend\u2019s house in Kingston who was a drug-dealer being watched by investigators.\n\n\u201cShe was basically hanging out smoking for free,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nMiraglia adds, \u201cI was an addict, not a drug dealer.\u201d\n\nFight for law degree\n\nMiraglia\u2019s past almost came back to haunt her and crush her dreams of being a lawyer.\n\nToward the end of her final year of law school, she learned the university wouldn\u2019t certify her as a person fit to practice law because of her criminal history - a requirement of the American Bar Association.\n\n\u201cAfter she spent $300,000 that she didn\u2019t have,\u201d DeLuca pointed out.\n\nPrior to treatment court, Miraglia also faced a cocaine charge, but it was expunged as a result of her completion of the program.\n\nFollowing treatment court, Miraglia was charged with burglary, but she considered it more of a rescue when she entered a house to retrieve her 2-year-old daughter. She said she learned her daughter wasn\u2019t being properly supervised at the child\u2019s father\u2019s house - in violation of a custody order that required another adult being present.\n\nThe arresting officer later reduced the charge and she got the case expunged, too, Deluca said.\n\nBut school officials already knew this because it was contained in her application for admission, Miraglia said.\n\nMiraglia said the reason the school claimed she was unfit was that she didn\u2019t previously disclose underage drinking and harassment charges she got as a minor. The Kingston native, who attended Wyoming Valley West schools, said she was in trouble with the police often as a juvenile - and didn\u2019t initially remember some things on her juvenile record.\n\n\u201cI apologize to my father all the time to this day because I drove him nuts,\u201d Miraglia said.\n\nDeLuca lobbied school officials to change their mind.\n\nEventually they did.\n\n\u201cIt was one person who filed an honor code complaint,\u201d Miraglia said.\n\nReaching the bar\n\nThe school finally cleared Miraglia just three weeks before the February 2017 bar exam. She wasn\u2019t ready, but the next bar exam wasn\u2019t until July 2017, her loan payments started to kick in and she needed a job.\n\nAt the time, she was serving as a non-paid intern for the defense team of notorious cop killer Eric Frein. She was the third-chair counsel for Frein\u2019s death penalty trial in Pike County, having been selected by longtime veteran defense attorney Bill Ruzzo, who admired her work.\n\nDuring the trial, Miraglia discovered she failed the exam.\n\n\u201cThe first person who knew I failed the bar exam was Eric Frein. I was crying,\u201d Miraglia recalled.\n\nMiraglia took the exam again in July 2017. The good news? She passed. The bad news? The Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners still refused to issue her a law license because of her past.\n\nRuzzo, who died last year, also had a criminal record before becoming a lawyer and vowed to lead the fight to appeal the decision. A hearing was set for The Justice Center in Harrisburg and Ruzzo lined up a cast of legal minds from Luzerne County to attend to vouch for Miraglia\u2019s good character and work ethic, including County Manager David Pedri.\n\nMiraglia had interned with Pedri in the solicitor\u2019s office previously. Ironically, he also was the one who signed the document accepting her into the drug treatment court program in 2006 when he worked in the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nWeeks after the hearing, the Pennsylvania Board of Law Examiners reversed its decision and agreed to grant Miraglia a law license.\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2018, she was sworn in by Luzerne County Judge Joseph Sklarosky Jr., who now is in charge of treatment court. Following a short stint in the private sector, the county hired Miraglia in October as part of its pool of conflict counsel attorneys.\n\n\u201cDoing what I do, I see people looking for a second chance,\u201d Miraglia said.\n\nPedri saluted Miraglia\u2019s life turnaround.\n\n\u201cAttorney Miraglia is a true example of what could be,\u201d Pedri said. \u201cWhat could be if you acknowledge your mistakes, learn and grow. What could be if you work hard and with determination. What could be if you care about the community. Luzerne County is proud to employ her and I hope her story inspires others having a difficult time of what could be for them.\u201d\n\nFather-like mentorship\n\nAt the time Miraglia was arrested in 2005 by the state Attorney General\u2019s office, she had not thought of changing her lifestyle.\n\nShe has been doing drugs since 8th grade, but hadn\u2019t been in any serious trouble before besides citations for minor things like fighting.\n\nBut this time, she knew she needed an attorney and went to visit DeLuca.\n\n\u201cI needed an attorney - and more drugs - is probably what I was thinking at the time,\u201d Miraglia said.\n\nAfter talking to Miraglia, DeLuca had a question for her.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Jessica, what the hell are you doing here? You\u2019re brilliant,\u2019\u201d DeLuca said.\n\nThe moment has led to father-daughter-like relationship between the two the past 14 years.\n\nAt the time, Luzerne County didn\u2019t allow those with felony changes into treatment court, but DeLuca was able to convince prosecutors to lessen the charges to allow her entry. Aside from helping Miraglia fight to get her law license, DeLuca gave her internships and a full-time job, allowing her to bring her daughter to work at his office. He served as Miraglia\u2019s sponsor into the Wilkes-Barre Law and Library Association.\n\nNow, he plans to launch a fundraiser to help pay off her $300,000 in law school loans. He\u2019s hoping the national media picks up her story.\n\nDuring a meeting in front of a reporter, he told her how proud he was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed obstacle after obstacle put in front of you and you persevered,\u201d DeLuca said.\n\n___\n\nSidebar:\n\nWHAT IS TREATMENT COURT?\n\nThe Luzerne County Treatment Court program serves as an intensive probation sentence for first-time, non-violent drug offenders who want their records expunged.
