Previously women needed permission from a male guardian to rent a hotel room.\n\nHowever, unmarried Saudi couples will still need to provide proof of a marital relationship.\n\n\"All Saudi nationals are asked to show family ID or proof of relationship on checking into hotels,\" the tourism authority said.\n\nWomen will also be allowed to rent hotel rooms without any form of identification if they have a male guardian present who does have proof of identity, it said.\n\nThe move comes amid deep reforms over the past year by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) which has lifted a ban on movie theatres in the kingdom and the world's only ban on women driving.\n\nCritics note there are limits to the reforms, and point to last year's killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the reported torture of several imprisoned women's rights activists.\n\nA new push for tourism\n\nLast week, Saudi Arabia announced the new tourist visa scheme, saying it was aiming to increase tourism to contribute up to 10 percent of the gross domestic product compared with three percent currently.\n\nFor the launch of its new visa, the country was highlighting five UNESCO World Heritage sites, contemporary art sites and natural sites including the Red Sea, desert and mountains.\n\nPreviously, visitor visas were issued only for specific reasons such as for Muslim religious pilgrimages, to visit family or for business.\n\nThe one-year, multiple-entry visa scheme allows for stays of up to 90 days at a time and marks the first time the country is allowing foreigners to visit solely for the purpose of tourism.", "description": "Saudi women can rent hotel rooms and foreign unmarried couples can share a room as restrictions eased to boost tourism.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/7c437245772548dab34d1f9866911d5b_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
