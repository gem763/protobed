The official, Fiona Hill, learned then about the involvement of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Giuliani associates who were helping with the Naftogaz pressure and also with trying to find dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.\n\nHill quickly briefed then-National Security Adviser John Bolton about what she\u2019d been told, said the individuals with knowledge of the meeting.\n\nThe revelation significantly moves up the timeline of when the White House learned that Trump\u2019s allies had engaged with the incoming Ukrainian administration and were acting in ways that unnerved the Ukrainians \u2014 even before President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had been sworn in. Biden had entered the presidential race barely three weeks earlier.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nbcnews.Com Politics Trump-Impeachment-Inquiry"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
