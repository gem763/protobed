Mostly they spend their time on factional organisation.\n\nEight years of opposition in the state, and six years in Canberra, have given the clique of right-wing MPs and union leaders who control the party a different perspective.\n\nThe NSW Labor Party's reputation for corrupt and ethically challenged behaviour, which extends back to the notorious Obeid years, operates as an electoral pesticide against Labor candidates.\n\nIn a era when $100,000 donations can be dropped off in an Aldi shopping bag, there is a belief that cross-factional participation in the administration of the party would increase internal transparency and accountability.\n\nAsked if the new structure would ensure future general secretaries are not corrupt, one left MP said on Monday: \"That will be a good start.\"\n\nThe NSW Labor Party general secretary is unusually powerful. In addition to running the party's administration, they are a leader of the NSW right faction, which can be pivotal in selection of the federal leader. By being able to influence the selection of parliamentary candidates, they have an outsize influence on the policies of the state party too.\n\nIn return for such influence, the general secretary is responsible for raising the huge sums needed to fund modern election campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the pioneers was Eric Roozendaal, the general secretary from 1999 to 2004, who was so successful at tapping into the bank accounts of wealthy property developers eager for political access that a Coalition government banned the practice.\n\nRoozendaal ended up working for the developer with the Aldi shopping bag that the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption was told was used to make an illegal donation to the party.\n\nPolitical power, cash and youth is a dangerous combination. Sam Dastyari got the job when he was 27, and now says he was too young. Kaila Murnain, who was suspended in August, was 29. Richardson was 26.\n\nKaila Murnain leaves the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption in September. AAP\n\nIn addition to requiring future secretaries general to delegate more responsibility, party figures want the president - usually an experienced party figure - given more responsibility for overseeing their charge.\n\nThe general secretary reports to the party's administrative committee, which lost its ability to be an effective overseer when it was stacked with 48 party members owed favours by faction leaders.\n\nIn essence, the Labor Party wants to do what business worked out last century is the ideal organisational structure: a cohesive board monitoring a unified management team.\n\nSome party members would like the changes to go further. One suggestion made by a former senior party figure on Monday is the creation of a separately administered and audited fund driven by small and medium-sized donors.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders-like vehicle may be too ambitious, at the moment, for a party that is finally trying to learn from its long history of mistakes.
