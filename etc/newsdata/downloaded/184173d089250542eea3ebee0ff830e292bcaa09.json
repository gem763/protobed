(Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP)\n\nJulia G. Young is associate professor of history at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and author of \" Mexican Exodus: Emigrants, Exiles, and Refugees of the Cristero War .\"\n\nToday, the Vatican celebrates the World Day of Migrants and Refugees. The day was instituted in 1914 by Pope Pius X, and has been celebrated every year since then.\n\nIn the United States these days, it can feel like there is very little to celebrate for immigrants and those who support them. Yet the World Day of Migrants and Refugees reminds us that even in times of immigration restriction and nativism during our history, migrants, refugees and secular and religious aid organizations have continuously fought to create more progressive and humane policies.\n\nWe are in a particularly dark period. Three years into the Trump presidency, the administration\u2019s attacks on our immigration system have accelerated in horrifying ways. This summer, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched raids across the country, terrifying immigrant workers and tearing apart families. As of early September, more than 50,000 immigrants are being held in detention centers across the country. The Trump administration is making it far more difficult for people to seek asylum and sending thousands of vulnerable migrants to await their hearings in dangerous cities in Mexico. Just this week, the government announced it plans to reduce the cap on refugees to the unprecedented low of 18,000.\n\nYet while all of these developments might seem terrifyingly new, they also have precedents in our country\u2019s history.\n\nDuring the 1920s, Congress passed laws that excluded millions of people from migrating to the United States, based solely on their national origin. Asian immigrants were excluded completely (most Chinese immigrants had in fact been banned since 1882), as were most eastern and southern Europeans, Africans and residents of the Middle East. In the 1930s, the U.S. launched campaigns of deportation in which hundreds of thousands of Mexicans were rounded up and sent across the border. The violence extended even to U.S. citizens perceived to be \u201cforeign\u201d: During World War II, the U.S. rounded up 120,000 Japanese Americans and put them in internment camps across the country. In the same period, the government denied asylum to European war refugees, even sending a shipload of Jewish refugees back to danger and death in Europe.\n\nBut if it is true the United States is returning to its nativist past, there is also reason to hope that things might get better in the future \u2014 thanks in large part to the very people once targeted by nativist laws.\n\nIn the early 20th century, many immigrant groups responded to discrimination and nativism by forming organizations that could provide mutual support for immigrants, help them resist the rising tide of nativism and advocate and lobby lawmakers on their behalf.\n\nFor example, Italian Americans, in 1905, founded the Order Sons of Italy to provide education and legal help to Italian immigrants, as well as to advocate for reforms to the policies that kept Italians from immigrating to the United States. The American Jewish Committee was founded in 1906 and became an advocacy organization that, along with other Jewish groups such as the Anti-Defamation League, fought anti-Semitism and lobbied for a more humane immigration policy.\n\nThe National Catholic Welfare Conference, founded by the U.S. Catholic bishops in 1919, established its own Immigration Bureau in 1920, and became an important immigrant advocacy organization, providing legal aid to immigrants of all faiths in New York, San Francisco, El Paso and other immigrant entry points. By the 1950s, the NCWC was deeply involved in lobbying to end the national-origins laws and develop a more just immigration system.\n\nIn 1929, Japanese Americans formed the Japanese American Citizens League, an organization that worked assiduously for decades to fight discrimination against Japanese and other Asian Americans, as well as to push for immigration reforms.\n\nEventually, through the efforts of a wide array of immigrant, ethnic and religious associations like these, and in collaboration with other civil rights activists, lawmakers were persuaded to respond to their demands, and immigrants were able to achieve new levels of political power.\n\nIn 1965, the U.S. ended the racist laws that banned people based on their nationality, and set up the system that we have in place to this day \u2014 one that allows people to immigrate based on family reunification and professional skills. Three years later, the U.S. signed on to the international refugee regime, subsequently formalizing our system of asylum with the Refugee Act of 1980. These laws were not perfect, but they fundamentally changed immigration to the United States, allowing for huge increases in immigration from national groups that had formerly been barred from entry, and creating a formal path to entry for refugees and those who sought asylum.\n\nThese developments from our immigration history can give us hope \u2014 and a blueprint \u2014 for a better future.\n\nToday, new and old organizations are collaborating all over the country to counter the nativist and xenophobic policies of the Trump administration. Take just three recent events in the D.C. area that were held in the past few weeks and suggest we shall overcome the darkness of the present moment.\n\nThe first was a panel at my local public library in Arlington, Va., entitled \u201cYearning to Breathe Free: The Roots of Central American Migration.\u201d I gave a brief background and history on Central American migration, while the other panelists, all activists for Latino and immigrant civil rights organizations, including the League of Latin American Citizens, the CAIR Coalition, the Latin America Working Group and Just Neighbors, described their daily efforts to raise awareness among immigrant communities about their rights, to get them out of detention and to lobby for better laws.\n\nThe second was an exhibit at the Phillips Collection in Washington entitled \u201cThe Warmth of Other Suns: Stories of Global Displacement.\u201d The exhibit displayed an enormous collection of art by and about migrants and refugees, and demonstrated how artists in the U.S. and worldwide are confronting the experiences of global migration, immigrants\u2019 rights and asylum and refugee policy.\n\nThe third, \u201cUndocumented and Unafraid: Student Activism in the Era of Deportation,\u201d was sponsored by Faith in Public Life and hosted at D.C.\u2019s Trinity University. Four undocumented students from D.C.-area Catholic universities spoke openly about the fear and uncertainty that has shaped their lives. Despite the challenges they face, they are advocating for themselves and for others by connecting to a broad and growing community of immigration activists, even at the risk of their own deportation. These students, and thousands like them, are the vanguard of a broader political movement that includes new and old immigrant rights\u2019 organizations.\n\nThese three events \u2014 public, diverse, forward-looking \u2014 are just a tiny sample of what is happening all over the country, as activists are getting more involved in the movement for immigrants\u2019 rights. Some Catholic groups, too, are taking part in new ways, joining a broad coalition of religious activists in public protest and acts of civil disobedience.\n\nThe changes that immigration activists seek will take time, perhaps decades to achieve. The work to recognize the humanity and dignity of all people will be ongoing. In the meantime, many more people are likely to be hurt, deported and even killed because of U.S. migration policies.", "description": "More than a century after the first World Day of Migrants and Refugees communities continue to resist nativism and fight for immigrant rights.", "authors": ["Julia G.
