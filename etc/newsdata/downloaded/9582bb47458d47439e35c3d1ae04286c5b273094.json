Adam Schiff repeats unfounded claim that Trump sought 'manufactured dirt' on Biden", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Adam B. Schiff on Sunday repeated his unfounded allegation that President Trump asked the president of the Ukraine to \u201cmanufacture dirt\u201d on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden.\n\nNo such language is in a transcript of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nRepublicans over the past two years have accused Mr. Schiff of fabricating evidence in the Russia probe and at one point asked him to quit as chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nMr. Schiff, California Democrat, first made the \u201cmanufacture dirt\u201d allegation Thursday during a committee hearing, saying he was quoting what was in a transcript of a July call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky.\n\nWhen Republicans responded that no such wording exists in the transcript, Mr. Schiff agreed and said he had been doing \u201cparody.\u201d\n\nHe repeated that explanation on CNN.\n\nMr. Trump accused him of lying. A GOP congressman filed a resolution calling on the House to censure Mr. Schiff for fabricating quotes out of a document that is being used to try to impeach the president.\n\nBut on Friday night, Mr. Schiff tweeted the allegations again, saying the \u201cwhistleblower told us\u201d Mr. Trump ordered up \u201cmanufactured dirt\u201d during the phone call.\n\nSuch an explosive allegation is not in the whistleblower\u2019s nine-page complaint he sent to Congress on Aug. 12 that spurred Democrats to open an impeachment inquiry.\n\nNeither is Mr. Trump quoted in the official transcript as making such a remark in the July phone.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Mr. Schiff repeated the charge.\n\n\u201cAnd the president used that opportunity to try to coerce that leader to manufacture dirt on his opponent and interfere in our election,\u201d Mr. Schiff said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a series of facts more damning than that.\u201d\n\nABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos didn\u2019t ask a follow-up on how the remark on Thursday was \u201cparody\u201d and now is confirmed.\n\nRepublicans issued a letter last winter calling for Mr. Schiff to step down.\n\nThey say, for example, that he told the public that he had seen secret evidence of Mr. Trump conspiring with the Russians. He has never produced such evidence. Former special counsel Robert Mueller said he did not establish a conspiracy. No Trump associate was charged with collusion.\n\nMr. Schiff championed the Russian-sourced Democratic Party-financed dossier whose many allegations against Mr. Trump were shown to be false.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
