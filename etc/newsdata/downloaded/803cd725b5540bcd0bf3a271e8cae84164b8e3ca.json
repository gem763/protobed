They\u2019re too weak.", "language": "en", "text": "Fitzgerald\u2019s example speaks to the bravery and tenacity of the men and women working for the U.S. government who, at great personal and financial risk, expose corruption. Yet despite the progress in protecting whistleblowers, too many loopholes remain that lead to their punishment.\n\nFitzgerald blew his whistle very publicly, in an appearance before Congress\u2019s Joint Economic Committee, in 1968. His job was to analyze the cost of military projects, and his bosses sent him to Capitol Hill to discuss Lockheed C-5A transport planes. Told to dodge questions about the cost, he instead announced that the planes were running $2 billion over budget, stunning policymakers and the public. He lasted two years in his job before President Richard M. Nixon ordered him fired. (\u201cI said get rid of that son of a bitch,\u201d the White House taping system recorded the president as saying.) Fitzgerald was told that his job at the Pentagon had been eliminated.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFitzgerald turned to the Civil Service Commission to help him get his job back and, after four lean years, was reinstated in 1973 \u2014 but the Air Force made sure to keep him away from the important projects and big contractors: His daughter told a Washington Post obituary writer that they \u201cput him in charge of inspecting bowling alleys in Thailand.\u201d (Fitzgerald also sued Nixon and lost, in a case that set the important precedent that presidents were immune from personal lawsuits.) Upset at the menial tasks the Air Force assigned him, Fitzgerald sued again and, in 1982, won back his old job, gaining more responsibilities and $200,000 in legal fees.\n\nIn his numerous appearances before Congress, his specialty was breaking down the cost of monumentally expensive weapons systems and planes into digestible nuggets. \u201cRemember the $450 hammers, $640 toilet seats and $7,600 coffee pots?\u201d Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) asked in a tribute to Fitzgerald he delivered on the Senate floor in February. \u201cThose price tags for spare parts gave taxpayers sticker shock for good reason.\u201d\n\nGrassley repeatedly invited Fitzgerald to testify, and that relationship may help to explain why Grassley has recently broken with his conservative peers to defend whistleblowers in general and the Ukraine whistleblower in particular. \u201cThis person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected,\u201d Grassley has said, also arguing against \u201couting\u201d the Ukraine whistleblower, which Trump has proposed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFitzgerald had powerful detractors, even after he won his job back and was winning plaudits on Capitol Hill. Verne Orr, secretary of the Air Force during the Reagan administration, famously described him as \u201cthe most hated person in the Air Force.\u201d\n\nFitzgerald\u2019s reputation and work helped lead to the adoption of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, which President George H.W. Bush signed into law and which was intended to protect federal employees from retaliatory measures. A separate act governs whistleblowing in the intelligence agencies: the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, which has been updated several times. Fitzgerald also championed the National Taxpayers Union and helped inspire an array of nongovernmental organizations that assist whistleblowers, such as the Project on Government Oversight and the Government Accountability Project.\n\nWhistleblower protections, however, remain patchy and underenforced. Most federal whistleblowers are in theory shielded from retaliation \u2014 if they follow the overly complex rules for reporting their concerns. But PEN America and other groups that have studied whistleblowers find that when whistleblowers report retaliation, the reports tend to be brushed aside.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd protections for whistleblowers in the intelligence community have long been weaker than those for other government workers. The original Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 created a reporting mechanism but did not ban retaliation. Later statutes and presidential orders remedied that situation, but not consistently: Contractors were long excluded from the anti-retaliation aspects of the laws, for example.\n\nMany critics argued that Edward Snowden should have gone through official channels, for example, rather than leaking information about National Security Agency surveillance, as he did in 2013. But Snowden was a contractor whom the law did not cover at the time.\n\nAfter Jason Amerine, a former Army Green Beret, told a member of Congress about inadequacies in the FBI\u2019s hostage recovery program, the Army started a criminal investigation and revoked his security clearance \u2014 ostensibly because he revealed classified information to the Congress member. (Admittedly, Amerine\u2019s champion, Rep. Duncan D. Hunter (R-Calif.) had his own ethical problems, but Amerine followed the rules). The inspector general of the Defense Department found \u2014 incredibly \u2014 that Amerine had faced no retaliation, showing that IG offices are hardly independent in these matters. When an IG office decides against a whistleblower, there\u2019s often nowhere else to turn, legally.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s vitriolic attacks on the Ukraine whistleblower as a \u201cspy\u201d who may have committed \u201ctreason\u201d remind us that whistleblowers need stronger shields than they have. Congress should make the reporting process clearer, give teeth to the anti-retaliation provisions of the law and ensure that protections for intelligence agency workers are as robust as those for other government employees.\n\n\u201cCourageous truth-tellers can make all the difference,\u201d Grassley said in February, memorializing Fitzgerald. Those words ring all the more true eight months later.\n\nAD", "description": "Retaliation is still far too common, especially for intelligence community whistleblowers.", "authors": ["Aryeh Neier", "Aryeh Neier Is President Emeritus Of The Open Society Foundations.
