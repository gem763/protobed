Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday's carnival to celebrate Caribbean culture AFP/Getty\n\nHe's in a truly terrible position.\n\nThere has never been a less powerful chancellor in modern British political history.\n\nEven the really bad ones, like Norman Lamont, who sang in his bath when the pound crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, had good people around them.\n\nCrucially, the rest of government also had to pay due heed to the Treasury, which was the most important department in government. If ministers didn\u2019t, there would be a high price to be paid when the sweeties were doled out.\n\nUnder Johnson, that\u2019s gone. Having denigrated the Treasury as \u201cthe heart of Remain\u201d he and Cummings have neutered it. The has created a degree of chaos in Whitehall; it has torn up all the usual rules.\n\nThat\u2019s something the gangsters at the top seem to want and enjoy. But it\u2019s not a sustainable situation. While it may frustrate and exasperate prime ministers, the Treasury\u2019s power is necessary for good functioning of government.\n\nAll the same, let\u2019s look at what are we going to get with this \u201cfirst post-Brexit budget\u201d.\n\nWell, we won\u2019t get a budget at all if Johnson finds a way to contrive Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal because the Treasury, sorry, Johnson and Cummings, will have to assess the economic impact of that and how best to respond to a developing crisis.\n\nIn that event, there will simply be an \u201ceconomic statement\u201d. Goodness knows what that will involve. How do you put a positive gloss on \u201cwe\u2019re in deep doo doo? We\u2019re throwing money here, and we\u2019re throwing money there, and, can we still get valium in through Dover? Failing that, can we commission a plane to fly us some in?\n\nLet\u2019s say the chancellor does end up at the despatch box for something more substantial than that, either during an extension or after a deal has been signed.\n\nAs always during these events, there will be a battery of economic experts and commentators lining up to look at the forecasts, to pick through the details, and to offer up weighty analysis of what\u2019s been presented.\n\nParticular attention will be paid to what\u2019s happened to the government rules that call for borrowing to be held below 2 per cent of national income, or \u00a346bn in real money.\n\nThing is, this is not a government that\u2019s interested in rules or reality, or even money really, at least not in the way previous Conservative governments used to be. Perhaps it\u2019s because this isn\u2019t really a Conservative government at all. It\u2019s the hard right in Conservative clothes.\n\nThe only analysis you\u2019ll really need I can offer you right now. We the electorate will be offered up a bribe. A big, fat, bribe with our own money, paid for on the never-never. It\u2019ll be the sort of budget the Tory Party for years criticised Labour for promising, a cynical attempt to neuter the appeal of Corbyn and McDonnell for those who care about public services, particularly education and the NHS.\n\nGood luck getting it through parliament, mind. All the opposition parties will vote against because that\u2019s what opposition parties are supposed to do. Some of the Tories who got the whip withdrawn might be inclined to do that as well, because they\u2019re honest to goodness Conservatives.\n\nWere this a normal, sensible government, Javid might be quite good in No11. He\u2019s a former banker who knows numbers. He has brains, which is more than can be said for a depressingly high number of his cabinet colleagues.\n\nBut this is not a normal, sensible government. So with his \u201cfirst post-Brexit budget\u201d he\u2019s being asked to cast his chief attributes aside in favour of polishing up a pile of cynical yuck. That\u2019s something he\u2019s not very good at. You only need to look at his last big House of Commons performance, which was truly awful, to see that.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but remember you read it here: I wouldn\u2019t put money on him holding on to No11 for long if Johnson manages to hold on to No10.", "description": "\u201cThis will be the first Budget after leaving the EU,\u201d said Sajid Javid, who has the title of Chancellor of the Exchequer, but is in reality little more than a PR man for Boris Johnson/Dominic Cummings.\u00a0 He was announcing 6 November as the big day.
