Residents have scattered. Some are living with relatives, in cheap motels nearby, or, authorities say, in camping tents and cars.\n\nMeanwhile, inside a San Francisco courtroom $1,600-an-hour lawyers, representing everyone from bond and equity holders to a billionaire investor, joust over control of PG&E Corp., the utility that went bankrupt after its equipment sparked the blaze that killed 86 people. Each day of the reorganization racks up about $1 million in fees and related expenses for lawyers, bankers and restructuring experts.\n\nThe stark contrast has frustrated many of the victims, who say PG&E has brushed aside their concerns while offering insufficient payouts, despite the utility\u2019s vow to compensate them. And now they face a deadline of 5 p.m. Monday to file claims for injuries and property damage\u2014far less time than normally granted outside of bankruptcy, say their lawyers, who\u2019ve asked for an extension.\n\n\u201cI keep hearing PG&E say they will make it right,\u201d says Karen Gowins, 71, who lost her 3,000-square-foot Paradise home in the Camp fire and now lives in two trailers with her husband, Rich, and son, Adrian. \u201cI don\u2019t have high hopes for that. They would rather pay for legal fees and litigation than pay wildfire claims.\u201d\n\nThe dispute is another sign of how complex and fraught PG&E\u2019s bankruptcy reorganization\u2014one that could determine the future of power delivery in the most populous state in the U.S.\u2014has become. The utility filed for bankruptcy in January in the face of an estimated $30 billion of liabilities tied to more than a dozen wildfires.\n\nAs the parties duke it out over who will eventually run PG&E, it\u2019s even led to a seemingly odd-bedfellows coalition: Many of the fire victims have thrown their support behind a group of PG&E creditors led by bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co. and activist investor Paul Singer and his Elliott Management Corp. hedge fund.\n\nThe reason: PG&E has set aside $8.4 billion for payouts to individual victims while Elliott Management has offered $13.5 billion in a rival reorganization proposal that would virtually wipe out the existing shareholders.\n\n\u201cPG&E remains focused on doing right by the customers and communities we serve,\u201d spokesman James Noonan said in a statement. \u201cPG&E believes the Chapter 11 process will support the orderly, fair and expeditious resolution of claims, including wildfire claims.\u201d\n\nVictim lawyers say they expect half or less of the approximately 100,000 eligible claims to be submitted by the deadline. Many people either think there won\u2019t be enough money for them to be compensated or, having been displaced, lack the wherewithal to file, said the attorneys, who want the due date pushed back to Jan. 31.\n\nFrank Pitre, a lawyer for fire victims, said that under the normal statute of limitations, a person would have two years to file a claim for injury or death and three years for property damage. It\u2019s not unusual, however, for claims within bankruptcy to have a shorter time limit as a way to speed up the process.\n\nPG&E is trying to emerge from bankruptcy by June 30. The company has estimated it would spend as much as $22 million notifying potential victims about the deadline with 6.2 million mailings, emails and advertisements.\n\n\u201cOur court-approved claims notification process is broad and thorough\u2014above and far beyond what is typical in a Chapter 11 process,\u201d Noonan said.\n\nThat\u2019s been of little solace to many of the victims.\n\n\u201cWe feel as though our lives have been erased,\u201d said George Bell, 68, whose Paradise home was badly burned by the Camp Fire. \u201dIt was and continues to be a horrifying, devastating life-changing event.\u201d\n\nAfter driving separately through flames in a harrowing escape, George and his wife, Debora, first took shelter in their daughter\u2019s apartment and then moved to a \u201cflea-bag\u201d hotel in Redding. Since then, they\u2019ve moved to a series of hotel rooms and are now located at Residence Inn in Roseville. What\u2019s worse: Bell gave 36 years of his life to PG&E as an electrical technician.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Almost a year after California\u2019s deadliest wildfire was finally snubbed out, what\u2019s left of the mountain town of Paradise is mostly empty housing lots, burned-out cars and skeletons of storefronts.
