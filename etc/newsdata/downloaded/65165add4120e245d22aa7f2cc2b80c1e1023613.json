No one knows what became of the victims. They may have died without knowing that they were part of the CIA\u2019s highly secretive program to develop ways to control minds\u2014a program based out of a little-known Army base with a dark past, Fort Detrick.\n\nSuburban sprawl has engulfed Fort Detrick (pronounced DEE-trick), the U.S. Army base 50 miles from Washington in the Maryland town of Frederick. Seventy-six years ago, however, when the Army selected Detrick as the place to develop its super-secret plans to wage germ warfare, the area around the base looked much different. In fact, it was chosen for its isolation. That\u2019s because Detrick, still thriving today as the army\u2019s principal base for biological research and now encompassing nearly 600 buildings on 13,000 acres, was for years the literal nerve center of the CIA\u2019s hidden chemical and mind-control empire.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDetrick is today one of the world\u2019s cutting-edge laboratories for research into toxins and anti-toxins, the place where defenses are developed against every plague, from crop fungus to Ebola. Its leading role in the field is widely recognized. For decades, though, much of what went on at the base was a closely held secret. Directors of the CIA mind control program MK-ULTRA, which used Detrick as a key base, destroyed most of their records in 1973. Some of its secrets have been revealed in declassified documents, through interviews and as a result of congressional investigations. Together, those sources reveal Detrick\u2019s central role in MK-ULTRA and in the manufacture of poisons intended to kill foreign leaders.\n\nIn 1942, alarmed by reports that Japanese forces were waging germ warfare in China, the U.S. Army decided to launch a secret program to develop biological weapons. It hired a University of Wisconsin biochemist, Ira Baldwin, to run the program, and asked him to find a site for a new bio-research complex. Baldwin chose a mostly abandoned National Guard base below Catoctin Mountain called Detrick Field. On March 9, 1943, the army announced that it had renamed the field Camp Detrick, designated it as headquarters of the Army Biological Warfare Laboratories and purchased several adjacent farms to provide extra room and privacy.\n\nAfter World War II, Detrick faded in importance. The reason was simple: The United States had nuclear weapons, so developing biological ones no longer seemed urgent. As the Cold War began, however, two seemingly unrelated developments on opposite sides of the world stunned the newly created Central Intelligence Agency and gave Detrick a new mission.\n\nThe first was the show trial of the Roman Catholic Primate of Hungary Joseph Cardinal Mindszenty for treason in 1949. At the trial, the Cardinal appeared disoriented, spoke in a monotone and confessed to crimes he had evidently not committed. Then, after the Korean War ended, it turned out that many American prisoners had signed statements criticizing the United States and, in some cases, confessed to war crimes. The CIA came up with the same explanation for both: brainwashing. Communists, the CIA concluded, must have developed a drug or technique that enabled them to control human minds. No evidence of this ever emerged, but the CIA fell hard for the fantasy.\n\nIn the spring of 1949 the Army created a small, super-secret team of chemists at Camp Detrick called the Special Operations Division. Its assignment was to find military uses for toxic bacteria. The coercive use of toxins was a new field, and chemists at the Special Operations Division had to decide how to begin their research.\n\nAt the same time, CIA had just established its own corps of chemical magicians. CIA officers in Europe and Asia were regularly capturing suspected enemy agents and wanted to develop new ways to draw prisoners in interrogation away from their identities, induce them to reveal secrets and perhaps even program them to commit acts against their will. Allen Dulles, who ran the CIA\u2019s covert-operations directorate and would soon be promoted to direct the Agency, considered his mind control project\u2014first named Bluebird, then Artichoke, then MK-ULTRA\u2014to be of supreme importance, the difference between the survival and extinction of the United States.\n\nIn 1951, Dulles hired a chemist to design and oversee a systematic search for the key to mind control. The man he chose, Sidney Gottlieb was not part of the silver-spoon aristocracy from which most officers of the early CIA were recruited, but a 33-year-old Jew from an immigrant family who limped and stuttered. He also meditated, lived in a remote cabin without running water and rose before dawn to milk his goats.\n\nGottlieb wanted to use Detrick\u2019s assets to propel his mind-control project to new heights. He asked Dulles to negotiate an accord that would formalize the connection between the military and the CIA in this pursuit. Under the arrangement\u2019s provisions, according to a later report, \u201cCIA acquired the knowledge, skill, and facilities of the Army to develop biological weapons suited for CIA use.\u201d\n\nTaking advantage of this arrangement, Gottlieb created a hidden CIA enclave inside Camp Detrick. His handful of CIA chemists worked so closely with their comrades in the Special Operations Division that they became a single unit.\n\nSome scientists outside the tight-knit group suspected what was happening. \u201cDo you know what a \u2018self-contained, off-the-shelf operation\u2019 means?\u201d one of them asked years later. \u201cThe CIA was running one in my lab. They were testing psycho-chemicals and running experiments in my labs, and weren\u2019t telling me.\u201d\n\nGottlieb searched relentlessly for a way to blast away human minds so new ones could be implanted in their place. He tested an astonishing variety of drug combinations, often in conjunction with other torments like electro-shock or sensory deprivation. In the United States, his victims were unwitting subjects at jails and hospitals, including a federal prison in Atlanta and an addiction research center in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nIn Europe and East Asia, Gottlieb\u2019s victims were prisoners in secret detention centers. One of those centers, built in the basement of a former villa in the German town of Kronberg, may have been the first secret CIA prison. While CIA scientists and their ex-Nazi comrades sat before the stone fireplace discussing the techniques of mind control, prisoners in basement cells were being prepared as subjects in brutal and sometimes fatal experiments.\n\nThese were the most gruesome experiments the U.S. government ever conducted on human beings. In one of the them, seven prisoners in Lexington, Kentucky, were given multiple doses of LSD for 77 straight days. In another, captured North Koreans were given depressant drugs, then dosed with potent stimulants and exposed to intense heat and electro-shock while they were in the weakened state of transition. These experiments destroyed many minds and caused an unknown number of deaths. Many of the potions, pills and aerosols administered to victims were created at Detrick.\n\nOne of the most well-known victims of the MK-ULTRA experiments was Frank Olson. Olson was a CIA officer who had spent his entire career at Detrick and knew its deepest secrets. When he began musing about quitting the CIA, his comrades saw a security threat. Gottlieb summoned the team to a retreat and arranged for Olson to be drugged with LSD. A week later, Olson died in a plunge from a hotel window in New York. The CIA called it suicide. Olson\u2019s family believes he was thrown from the window to prevent him from revealing what was brewing inside Camp Detrick.\n\nA decade of intense experiments taught Gottlieb that there are indeed ways to destroy a human mind. He never, however, found a way to implant a new mind in the resulting void. The grail he was seeking eluded him. MK-ULTRA ended in failure in the early 1960s. \u201cThe conclusion from all these activities,\u201d he admitted afterward, \u201cwas that it was very difficult to manipulate human behavior in this way.\u201d\n\nNonetheless Fort Detrick, as it was renamed in 1956, remained Gottlieb\u2019s chemical base. After the end of MK-ULTRA, he used it to develop and store the CIA\u2019s arsenal of poisons. In his freezers, he kept biological agents that could cause diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis and anthrax, and a number of organic toxins including snake venom and paralytic shellfish poison. He developed poisons intended to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba.\n\nDuring this period, Fort Detrick\u2019s public profile rose uncomfortably. No one knew that the CIA was making poisons there, but its role as the country\u2019s principal center for research into biological and anti-crop warfare became increasingly clear. From mid-1959 to mid-1960, protesters convened once a week at the gate. \u201cNo rationalization of \u2018defense\u2019 can justify the evil of mass destruction and disease,\u201d they wrote in a statement.\n\nIn 1970 President Nixon ordered all government agencies to destroy their supplies of biological toxins. Army scientists dutifully complied. Gottlieb hesitated. He had spent years assembling this deadly pharmacopeia and did not want to destroy it. After meeting with CIA Director Richard Helms, he reluctantly agreed that he had no choice.\n\nOne batch, a supremely potent shellfish poison known as saxitoxin, escaped destruction, though. Two canisters containing nearly eleven grams of saxitoxin\u2014enough to kill 55,000 people\u2014were in Gottlieb\u2019s depot at Fort Detrick. Before Army technicians could remove them, two officers from the Special Operations Division packed them into the trunk of a car and drove them to the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in Washington, where the CIA maintained a small chemical warehouse. One of Gottlieb\u2019s aides later testified that he had ordered this operation without informing his boss. By the time the saxitoxin was discovered and destroyed in 1975, Gottlieb had retired.\n\nGottlieb was the most powerful unknown American of the 20th century\u2014unless there was someone else who conducted brutal experiments across three continents and had a license to kill issued by the U.S. government. Detrick, his indispensable base, still contains untold stories of the cruelty that began there\u2014just 50 miles away from the center of the government that has kept them sealed for decades.", "description": "Today, it\u2019s a cutting-edge lab.
