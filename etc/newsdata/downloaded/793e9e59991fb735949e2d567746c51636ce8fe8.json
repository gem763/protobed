For me, I was privileged enough to be able to call him a dear friend,\" Meadows said. \"Some have classified it as an unexpected friendship, but for those of us that know Elijah, it's not unexpected or surprising.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only is he a quality man, we were able to share a number of personal stories and intimate secrets that Elijah never shared with anyone because he was a man of his word and he said he never would,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nMeadows said Cummings once told him that former Rep Darrell Issa Darrell Edward IssaElijah Cummings, Democratic chairman and powerful Trump critic, dies at 68 Indicted lawmaker Duncan Hunter fails to land endorsement from local GOP Duncan Hunter challenger raises over 0,000 in third quarter MORE (R-Calif.), who Cummings memorably tangled with during Issa's chairmanship of Oversight, would make him famous.\n\nMeadows said he disagreed, and that he had reminded Cummings \"not too long ago\" that he would be defined by his own actions.\n\n\u201cI reminded him not too long ago of a quip that he made, he said that Darrell Issa was going to make him famous,\" Meadows said. \"And I reminded him that he is not defined by other people, he's defined by the character of his heart, the honesty of his dialogue, and the man that we will miss.\u201d\n\nMeadows concluded by quoting scripture and stating that the world could benefit from more bipartisan friendships line the one he formed with Cummings, one of his closest colleagues in the lower chamber.\n\n\u201cScripture talks about let not your heart be troubled, you believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you, so Elijah has left his tent to go to a mansion, a better place. Perhaps this place and this country would be better served with a few more unexpected friendships. I know I have been blessed by one.\u201d\n\nCummings, 68, died last Thursday after a long battle with health complications.", "description": "Rep.
