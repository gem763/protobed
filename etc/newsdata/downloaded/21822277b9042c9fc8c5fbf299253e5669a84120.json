Police then found his body.\n\nLogan had become increasingly volatile and depressed in the three months before his death, Steve said.\n\nHe had made some new friends and started taking cocaine and drinking heavily.\n\nThe coroner said while Logan left notes for his family, he could have fallen while intoxicated and recorded an open conclusion.\n\nSteve says he believes \"100%\" that taking cocaine and alcohol together caused his death.\n\n\"To mix a stimulant with a depressant, it muddles your brain up completely and you just don't know where you are,\" he says.\n\nLogan's sister, Tillie, added: \"I like to think of who he was before. He was such a nice boy. To think of something like this changing someone in such a drastic way, it shows what it can do to you.\"\n\n'Increased impulsivity'\n\nFigures show there has been a rise in the number of alcohol-and-cocaine-related deaths over the past two decades, plus an increase in cocaine use.\n\nImage caption Prof Julia Sinclair says mixing cocaine and alcohol increases the likelihood of risky behaviour\n\nProfessor of addiction psychiatry Julia Sinclair, who is chairwoman of the faculty of addictions at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, explained that alcohol and cocaine were very different pharmacologically.\n\n\"Alcohol is a depressant, it increases the levels of Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in the brain, which is like its handbrake and makes us feel less anxious.\n\n\"You add cocaine into the mix and you have a rocket-fuelled increased impulsivity which gives people the driver to complete an act that they may not otherwise do. It's like crossing a road in front of a car speeding towards you.\"\n\nSome research in the US even suggests the mixture could increase the risk of suicide by a factor of 16.\n\nThere are calls for more research into the combination of alcohol and cocaine and its links with suicide or life-threatening behaviour.\n\nSome doctors believe that when you mix the two the organ produces a substance called cocaethylene, which may temporarily enhance the high - but also increases blood pressure, poor judgement and violent thoughts.\n\nProf Sinclair said: \"People are looking for what the ingredient that makes alcohol and cocaine such a toxic combo. It might be cocaethylene - but we don't know and everyone has a different response.\"\n\n'Violent thoughts'\n\nImage caption Love Island star Sophie Gradon died in June last year\n\nAmong those who have died in this way in the past year after consuming alcohol and cocaine are Love Island contestants Mike Thalassitis and Sophie Gradon and her boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, who took his own life just weeks after her.\n\nThere are no standardised statistics for these types of deaths. After consulting an academic, we found the figures by searching local and national media articles - it is likely the number of deaths will actually be higher.\n\nProf Sinclair said the way coroners recorded their conclusions could be obscuring emerging trends in difficult cases.\n\nIn the inquests we found, where the deceased hanged themselves - a conclusion of suicide was not always recorded, with \"narrative\", or open conclusions instead. But coroners have warned about the dangers in a number of cases.\n\nThe coroner who heard Ms Gradon's case, Eric Armstrong, said during his conclusion: \"There's a good deal of concern at the moment because of the consequences of taking alcohol and using cocaine.\n\n\"The combination, I'm given to understand, is used by those who believe it brings on a so-called high much quicker. What they don't appreciate is that it also appears to give rise to violent thoughts. If Sophie's death is to serve any purpose at all, that message should go far and wide.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said while coroners contributed to the compilation of death statistics, it was not their legal function.\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said it was investing \u00a325m in suicide-prevention efforts.\n\n\"We are also committed to reducing drug-and-alcohol-related harms and have commissioned a major independent review of drugs to help inform our thinking. And as part of the NHS long-term plan we are rolling out alcohol-care teams in hospitals with the highest number of alcohol-related admissions,\" he said.\n\nFollow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.", "description": "At least 13 self-inflicted deaths among people who took alcohol with cocaine have occurred in a year.", "authors": ["Anna Collinson", "Victoria Derbyshire Programme"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07pj8jx.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
