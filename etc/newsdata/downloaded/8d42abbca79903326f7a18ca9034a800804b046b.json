Disclaimer: they don\u2019t actually expect all of them to be right.\n\nBut 2019 is proving to be bizarre for traders and some of those calls are actually coming true. Of the eight \u201cfinancial-market surprises\u201d published by Standard Chartered Plc, two have effectively materialized, while three more still remain possible.\n\nComing True:\n\nThe Federal Reserve cutting interest rates (Done so twice, with another one priced in).\n\nThe European Central Bank restarting quantitative easing (By 20 billion euros per month from November).\n\nStill in Play:\n\nThe U.S. and China reach an agreement to weaken the dollar (Officials looking at rolling out currency pact).\n\nThe U.S. Treasury tries to sell 50-year bonds (May do so next year if there is appetite).\n\nThe U.K. faces a hard Brexit and the pound falls to parity with the dollar (Talks still currently taking place, though optimism is sparse).\n\nLooking Unlikely:\n\nHong Kong abandons its dollar currency peg (Traders including Hayman Capital Management\u2019s Kyle Bass are betting unrest will spur capital flight, but it hasn\u2019t happened).\n\nOPEC breaks up and Brent crude falls to US$25 a barrel (Supply deficit is at its widest level in years).\n\nJapan monetizes the national debt, the yen climbs to 80 per dollar (JPMorgan sees the yen as the \u201conly cheap recessionary hedge\u201d remaining).\n\nStandard Chartered aren\u2019t the only ones who had a punt. Saxo Bank A/S published their \u201c10 Outrageous Predictions\u201d for 2019 in December, including one that called a German recession. By most accounts, Europe\u2019s largest economy may be in one already. There is no sign of some of the others \u2014 including a solar flare creating chaos and a global transportation tax.\n\nNeither bank predicted a US$17 trillion pile of negative-yielding debt \u2014 bonds guaranteed to lose investors\u2019 money if held to maturity \u2014 a meltdown in the U.S. repo market, or a drone attack on a Saudi oil facility. But hey, you can\u2019t get everything right.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "2019 is proving to be bizarre for traders", "authors": ["John Ainger", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/fed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
