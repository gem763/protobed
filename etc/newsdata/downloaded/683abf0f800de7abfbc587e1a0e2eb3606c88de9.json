The Canadian dollar USDCAD, -0.0151% has climbed 0.3% against the greenback, with a single dollar fetching C$1.3250, while the Norwegian krone USDNOK, -0.0223% added 0.4%, changing hands at 8.9547 krone per dollar.\n\nThe currency of another major oil producer Russia, also a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019s OPEC+ group, was rising 0.8% against the buck. The U.S. dollar last bought 63.9170 rubles USDRUB, +0.0030% on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Mexico\u2019s peso USDMXN, -0.0190% also was enjoying a 0.2% rise against the buck, with the dollar buying 19.4377 pesos Monday afternoon.\n\nThe so-called petrocurrencies are those where the country derives a sizable share of its domestic revenue from oil exporting and therefore tends to see price swings along with crude-oil values.\n\nOn Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV19, -1.46% the U.S. benchmark contract, was up 14.7%, or $8.05, to settle at $62.90 a barrel, marking the largest daily gain for the most-active contract since Jan. 16, 2009, when prices surged more than 20%, according to FactSet data.\n\nNovember Brent crude BRNX19, -1.45% jumped $8.64, or 14.4%, to trade at $68.88 a barrel, which would represent the sharpest daily rise for the international benchmark since Dec. 11, 2008.\n\nDespite the gains for oil-pegged currencies, the dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.39%, was up 0.4% at 98.65 against a basket of major currency rivals.\n\nPrice spikes in crude came on the back of a Saturday attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field, which has thrown offline an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom\u2019s crude-oil production a day, equivalent to more than 5% of the world\u2019s daily supply.\n\nQuestions about the severity and duration of the disruption has rattled the energy markets, producing a lift to energy stocks and other assets pegged to crude prices and its byproducts.\n\n\u201cThis attack, which will no doubt raise headline inflation rates, makes steep cuts in US rates less likely. It may therefore boost the dollar,\u201d wrote Marshall Gittler, an independent currency analyst, in a Monday research report, referring to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Sept. 17-18 gathering, where is widely expected to cut benchmark domestic rates and signal its coming monetary policy plans.", "description": "Currencies linked to oil prices pop on Monday after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil production facilities over the weekend knocked out 5% of the world\u2019s...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GM429_cash_0_ZG_20180712133152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
