He was sacked seven times.\n\nThe Buccaneers also had a turnover on a muffed punt, leading to a fourth-quarter field goal for Carolina.\n\nMcCaffrey, a running back who has been one of the NFL's most productive players this year, was limited to 31 rushing yards and 26 receiving yards. He caught a 25-yard touchdown pass.\n\nThe Panthers were playing in their first international game, while the Buccaneers fell to 0-3 all-time in London.\n\nSamuel, a receiver, scored on a third-quarter run from 8 yards out one play after linebacker Luke Kuechly's interception and 25-yard return to give the Panthers a 27-7 lead.\n\nMatt Gay connected on a 54-yard field goal for the Buccaneers, closing the gap to 27-10.\n\nThen on the first play of the fourth quarter, Allen connected with Samuel on the side of the end zone for a 13-yard play and another touchdown.\n\nDown 37-26, Tampa Bay had a chance with less than three minutes to play, but Winston's pass was intercepted by Ross Cockrell. James Bradberry picked off Winston for the second time with 16 seconds to play.\n\nBuccaneers receiver Chris Godwin caught 10 passes for 151 yards.\n\nEarlier, Carolina scored the first points on Joey Slye's 49-yard field goal after Bradberry picked off Winston.
