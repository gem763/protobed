He may even have made the Iowa dairy and grain farmer a little poorer. But Schatz can live with that, for now.\n\n\u201cThis trade war with China, it\u2019s dropped prices of our corn and beans but it\u2019s something that needed to be done because China was unfair to us. I know we\u2019re going to take a hit. Some of us are getting a little frustrated but we\u2019re happy something\u2019s being done,\u201d he said.\n\nSchatz, a 36-year-old fifth-generation farmer, twice voted for Barack Obama and then hesitantly backed Trump in 2016 in Howard county, a rural Iowa county that saw one of the biggest shifts in support in the country from the outgoing Democrat to the Republican insurgent.\n\n\u201cI was never a huge fan of Trump but I voted for Obama both times and I was not very happy with him when he was done. I felt he didn\u2019t stand up to nothing,\u201d he said.\n\nSchatz said he will \u201cprobably\u201d vote for Trump again in the crucial swing state.\n\n\u201cThis trade war is the biggest thing. I worry that China is just going to wait it out for a Democrat to get in and a Democrat is going to say we\u2019ll just go back to the way it was or maybe even worse than it was,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Corn and soybeans grow on a farm on July 13, 2018 near Tipton, Iowa.

Voters who took a chance on Trump find plenty to dislike about the president but many say they have yet to be presented with a reason not to vote for him again.\n\nIt\u2019s those voters who played an important part in creating the biggest swing of any state from Obama in 2008 to Trump eight years later. Trump\u2019s victory was all the more shocking to the Democrats because the party had won Iowa in every presidential election for more than three decades. The last time a Republican took the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984.\n\nThe flipping of counties from Obama to Trump in the midwest \u2013 and the apparent paradox of Americans shifting from Obama to a man denounced as a misogynist, racist and bully \u2013 was instrumental in the president\u2019s victory.\n\nThis week, and at various stages in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, the Guardian is reporting from three midwest counties that swung from Obama to Trump in crucial states.\n\n\u2026\n\nHoward county is quintessential midwestern farm territory of enormous spaces pockmarked with grain silos on the state\u2019s northern border with Wisconsin. Sparsely populated \u2013 it has about 9,000 residents and falling \u2013 and 98% white, like much of the rural midwest it is struggling as agriculture becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of corporations. About one in 10 of the population lives in poverty.\n\nI\u2019ve been asking people, is your life really better? Are you getting paid that much more? Are you getting better healthcare? And they can\u2019t say yes.\n\n\n\nThe president\u2019s confrontational politics, wild tweeting and chaotic behaviour have done nothing to enhance Trump\u2019s standing in Schatz\u2019s eyes. But, for now at least, the farmer remains focused on what he regards as right about Trump and that\u2019s mostly his trade policies.\n\nFor months, the chair of Howard county\u2019s Democratic party, Laura Hubka, has been trying to work out how to change that dynamic and win ex-Obama voters like Schatz back. They will prove crucial in deciding who wins Iowa and, probably, the White House.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Laura Hubka. Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian\n\nAnd, in a note that will strike fear among senior Democrats, Hubka didn\u2019t think the recent debates helped with talk of \u201copen borders\u201d with Mexico and the lack of any coherent rural policy that spoke to much of Iowa. Additionally it seemed nothing could touch Trump. Even Robert Mueller\u2019s report on collusion with Russia during the 2016 campaign does not appear to have done the president any real damage in the state.\n\nThen came the impeachment inquiry in Congress. At first Hubka, a navy veteran and medical specialist, thought Trump would draw on it to strengthen support. But now she\u2019s beginning to think that it could be a game changer in rural Iowa.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard Nancy Pelosi say they were going to do this, I thought, oh my God, no. I thought impeachment\u2019s going to suck all the air out of the room and we\u2019re going to end up with every conversation not being about what our candidate has to offer but what crazy Trump is going to do. I feel like that did not win us the election last time,\u201d said Hubka.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m changing my attitude. More and more I\u2019m hearing people around here saying let\u2019s investigate him and get it over with. Every day he continues to say and do things, like not letting these people testify, it feels like he\u2019s piling on and making himself look more and more guilty.\u201d\n\nHubka thinks that the president may have a harder time shaking off these accusations in Middle America because they are over actions since he has been in the White House \u2013 not just on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the here and now. It\u2019s not something that happened in 2016, she said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A cardboard cutout of Donald Trump stands in the back of a Corvette as it rolls along with the Iowa State Fair Parade on 7 August 2019 in Des Moines, Iowa.

They seized the congressional district covering Howard county from a Republican incumbent with a 13% increase in the party\u2019s vote. The party also came close to unseating Congressman Steve King, whose association with far-right groups has made him a pariah even within his own party.\n\nBeyond rural Iowa there is a growing anti-Trump sentiment in the cities and among the young.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s some shifting going on,\u201d said Amanda Kloser, a 32-year-old teacher. \u201cEverything\u2019s in flux, which is really exciting but it\u2019s also really terrifying. You can see a lot of young participants getting really fired up. You saw the same thing with Obama when he ran a grassroots candidacy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Lynch. Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian\n\nFor all that, the votes of farmers, their workers and rural towns dependent on agriculture that drove the shift from Obama to Trump in large parts of Iowa will be significant in deciding whether the president can win the state again in 2020.\n\nSome farmers are openly hostile to Trump. Jack Lynch\u2019s crop farm is in neighbouring Chickasaw county, which saw a 21% majority for Obama transform into a similar-sized victory for Trump. He accuses the president of trying to buy farmers off with a $28bn bailout to compensate for the losses caused by the trade war. Lynch said it is causing long-term economic damage.\n\n\u201cI want a free trade so that you can sell your stuff where you want to. And if we don\u2019t get the trade war over with you\u2019ll have Argentina and Brazil will go into China and once they get the market we\u2019ll have a hard time getting it back,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has given dairy farmers such as Schatz reason to wonder if he will protect their long-term interests. Last week, Trump\u2019s agriculture secretary, Sonny Perdue, warned on a visit to neighbouring Wisconsin that family dairy farms may not survive in the face of competition from huge factory (farms).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aaron Schatz. Photograph: Chris McGreal/The Guardian\n\n\u201cIn America, the big get bigger and the small go out,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Schatz is open to change but cautious. He lost faith in Obama once the full effects of healthcare reform kicked in.\n\n\u201cFor me, being self-employed, the biggest thing that really hurt us was Obamacare. Our health insurance went from $400 a month to now we\u2019re spending $1,400 a month for my family. That has been the hardest thing. There\u2019s a lot of self-employed who saw the healthcare prices go up,\u201d said the father of two.\n\nSchatz is nonetheless open to ideas on healthcare reform including the public health insurance option proposed by Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all paying for it one way or another. In a way, I think I would favour it. I\u2019d just have to see what their plans are,\u201d he said\n\nHubka is spending her time targeting those crucial Obama-to-Trump swing voters, banging on doors telling voters that the president has not made their life better.\n\n\u201cWinning back those voters that flipped is the challenge. What\u2019s gonna be the magic thing? If it\u2019s the economy, I\u2019ve been asking people, is your life really better? Are you getting paid that much more? Are you getting better healthcare? And they can\u2019t say yes,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want a change but they\u2019re afraid of it. They\u2019re hearing there\u2019s more jobs and unemployment is lower so do they take a chance on Elizabeth Warren who wants big structural change? Or do we play it safe and say, even though Trump is an idiot, I\u2019m afraid of big structural change so we\u2019ll just do Trump again? That\u2019s what I\u2019m afraid of.\u201d", "description": "In the latest instalment of our series on the counties in which voters swung from Obama to Trump, Chris McGreal reports from Howard county, Iowa, where Trump voters have plenty to dislike \u2013 but would will vote for him again", "authors": ["Chris Mcgreal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96e3a78c6402022f6066633b41520ebd1226d5d2/0_60_4970_2982/master/4970.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2e988b847c3565986c0b2bdab4196be3", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
