The 82-year-old had challenged a California arbitration award that upheld nearly $7 million of a $9 million bill submitted by just one firm in the run-up to his first sexual assault trial in Pennsylvania in 2017.\n\nA judge sided Friday with the Los Angeles firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, rejecting Cosby's claim that the bill was \"egregious.\"\n\nCosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt isn't commenting on the fee dispute. But he says the actor is holding up well in a suburban Philadelphia prison, mentoring other inmates as he marks a year in prison Wednesday.\n\nCosby is serving three to 10 years for drugging and molesting a woman in 2004. The Pennsylvania Superior Court is weighing his appeal of the 2018 conviction.", "description": "A judge sided with a Los Angeles firm that rejected the 82-year-old's claim that the bill was \"egregious\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/17/19aa8429-9594-4a54-ba78-05d521df6101/thumbnail/1200x630g6/9c02efae2fdcbb5e238c0643dff1ab24/gettyimages-1039451142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
