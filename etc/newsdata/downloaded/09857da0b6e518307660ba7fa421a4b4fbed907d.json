Research by Karen Fingerman, a professor of human development and family sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, found that, compared to the mid-20th century, young adults today tend to be less financially stable and are more likely to marry later \u2014 keeping them closer to their families \u2014 while many more of them live with their parents. She also discovered that technology and accessibility of transportation make it easier to stay close. \u201cThe culture is shifting toward increased contact and increased interdependency\u201d between parents and their young adult children, Dr. Fingerman said.\n\nHer work indicates that 30 years ago, only half of parents reported weekly contact with a grown child, while currently nearly all parents had contact with a grown child in the past week, and over half of parents had contact with a grown child every day. She found affection and intimacy between young adults and their parents rising as well. Dr. Fingerman said this is generally a positive development that benefits both generations. As young adults turn more to their parents than their peers for guidance, \u201cthey\u2019re getting better advice from people who care about them,\u201d she said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Well Family Parenting-Young-Adult-Children.Html"], "top_image": ""}
