It was not immediately clear how that would work.\n\n\"Based on past experience, such unauthorised assembly will impose serious threat to public order and public safety,\" police said in a statement.\n\n\"Members of the public should avoid travelling to the concerned area when public disorder occurs.\"\n\nProtesters are angry at what they see as Beijing's increasing interference in Hong Kong, which returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a \"one country, two systems\" formula intended to guarantee freedoms not seen on the mainland. Some are increasingly focusing their fury on mainland Chinese in the city.\n\nChina denies meddling and has accused foreign governments, including the United States and Britain, of stirring up trouble.\n\nLam said she expected negative economic growth in the Asian financial hub this year, in part as a result of the unrest.\n\n\"The increasingly violent reality since June is hurting Hong Kong's economy,\" Lam said in a speech on Wednesday. \"...what started off as peaceful protests, a hallmark of Hong Kong's rights and freedoms, have turned into violent acts by rioters.\"\n\nWith visitors deterred by months of violence, many small firms across the city have already closed or are struggling to turn a profit.\n\nLam's made her gloomy forecast two days after Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Hong Kong had slipped into a technical recession, meaning two successive quarters of contraction. That is expected to be confirmed by Thursday's third-quarter GDP data.\n\nThe protests, which started over an extradition bill that has now been withdrawn, have plunged the city into its biggest crisis in decades and pose the biggest populist challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
