On Friday, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated that the central government \u201csupports, respects and understands\u201d the Hong Kong government\u2019s position regarding the five demands set out by protesters.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Hong Kong-Macao Affairs Office and the Office of Chief Executive Carrie Lam for comment on the Reuters report.", "description": "Pro-democracy leader in Hong Kong including Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow have been arrested ahead of a major protest.
