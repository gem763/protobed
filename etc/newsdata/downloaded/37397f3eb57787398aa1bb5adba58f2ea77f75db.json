The change will affect 2020 hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles sold by Toyota and can transfer from the original owner to subsequent owners. There are eight eligible cars in the lineup: the Camry, Corolla, Prius, RAV4, Avalon, and Highlander hybrids, plus the Prius Prime plug-in and the Mirai fuel-cell vehicle. Toyota says the longer warranty term is designed to help overcome the hesitation that some buyers feel toward purchasing a hybrid or electric vehicle.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Toyota Motor Company More\n\nThe eight-year/100,000-mile warranty will continue to apply to other parts of the hybrid system, including the motors and modules that control the system's power output. An eight-year warranty for hybrid components is fairly standard across the industry, but Toyota is not alone in offering more coverage. Hyundai offers a lifetime warranty for the Ioniq's battery, although that warranty only applies to the original owner.\n\n\n\nPhoto credit: Toyota Motor Company More\n\nThis isn't the first sign that carmakers trust their hybrid and electric vehicles' batteries to last for the long haul. Nissan has said that they expect Leaf batteries to last 10 to 12 years longer than customers will want to own the cars. Tesla is reportedly developing a battery technology that can last for a million miles.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Eight 2020 models get the longer coverage including Prius and other hybrids, Prius Prime plug-in, even the Mirai fuel-cell vehicle.", "authors": ["Annie White"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bf13gVtqeAguTnj0U9DSLg--~B/aD03MjE7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/a188172b8026b7ea2ee62cf89754b232", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
