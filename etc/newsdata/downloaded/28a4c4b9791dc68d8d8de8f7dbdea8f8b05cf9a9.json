But Philip Marfuggi, president of the Cheese Importers Association of America, says it still doesn\u2019t make sense for the U.S. to impose tariffs of only 10% on aircraft\u2014and not include aircraft parts\u2014and 25% tariffs on agricultural products.\n\n\u201cYou want to negotiate an agriculture deal, negotiate that, but don\u2019t use it as a bargaining chip in an airline dispute,\u201d says Marfuggi, who is also president and CEO of the Ambriola Co., a New Jersey importer largely of Italian cheeses. \u201cTo see that 10% [tariff on aircraft] and cheese, 25%\u2014that\u2019s difficult to comprehend.\u201d\n\nThe levies will go into effect Oct. 18 if approved by the WTO on Oct. 14, according to a Wednesday news release from the USTR.\n\nA wide range of imports to the U.S. stand to be affected, with most applied to products from France, Germany, Spain, and the U.K., which the USTR office said in the release are the \u201cfour countries responsible for the illegal subsidies\u201d for Airbus.\n\nBut the final list appears to create a hodge-podge application of tariffs that is likely to create significant market disparities between similar products on grocery and liquor-store shelves. The tariffs hit French still wine, for instance, but sparkling wine, including Champagne, from throughout Europe and the U.K. is spared. And while Spanish Rioja, German Riesling, and French Burgundy will all get pricier, wine from Italy or Austria won\u2019t feel the pinch.\n\nSimilarly, olive oil from Italy won\u2019t see tariffs, but olive oil from Spain will.\n\nThe impact to the market share of these products could lead to infighting among EU member states, Tobiassen says.\n\nPricier Cheese\n\nThe European cheese industry was hit particularly hard, with 80% of cheese coming out of Europe being affected, Marfuggi says.\n\nThat figure represents US$1 billion in imported cheese, which turns into about US$3.5 billion in revenue for U.S. companies and workers, he says. The tariffs will hit truckers, supermarket workers, and factory workers who convert bulk cheese into supermarket-ready products.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at probably 20,000 jobs in our industry [that] could be affected by these tariffs,\u201d Marfuggi says, noting that the 25% tariffs will be additional to existing tariffs that average about 12% to 15% on all cheese imports.\n\nWhat that will mean on grocery shelves is that a cheese costing US$15.99 a pound today will be US$24.99 a pound, while eight ounces of grated Parmesan will go from US$7.99 to US$13.99, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to slow sales down considerably,\u201d Marfuggi says.\n\nSimilarly, the beverage industry estimates there is significant potential damage to the approximately 12,000 beverage importers in the U.S. and the people who work for them.\n\nThese importers \u201cbring in brand names that are not necessarily well known across the country, but they\u2019ve developed a niche market\u201d for them, Tobiassen says. \u201cThey can\u2019t absorb tariffs the way large companies can.\u201d\n\nIn a news release, the Distilled Spirits Council says the tariffs on Scotch, liqueurs and cordials, and wine, could impact nearly US$3.4 billion in imports, and lead to the loss of 13,000 jobs in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a group of beverage trade groups, a 25% tariff on American whiskey imposed by the EU last summer in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has led to a 19% dive in exports. China has imposed a 54% retaliatory tariff on U.S. wine imports, which the trade groups say has caused a 57% nosedive in China trade this year.\n\nThe Wine Institute in the U.S. said on Thursday that it\u2019s concerned the new U.S. tariffs will lead to further retaliatory action by the EU and U.K., with tariffs subsequently slapped on wine exported from California. U.S. wine exports to the EU had reached US$469 million as of last year, representing the U.S.\u2019s largest wine export market.\n\nPreviously, the EU said it would impose tariffs on U.S. wine, vodka, and rum should the U.S. tariffs be imposed on EU goods, according to the aforementioned group of alcohol trade groups.", "description": "A 15-year dispute over aircraft subsidies leads to 25% tariffs on $7.5 billion in EU products", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-113567/social"}
