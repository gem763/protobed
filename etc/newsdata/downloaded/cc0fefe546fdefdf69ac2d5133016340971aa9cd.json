(AP) - Accountability seems to come naturally to Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore.\n\nHe\u2019ll castigate himself with the cameras on when he doesn\u2019t play well. He\u2019ll even volunteer when luck played a part in a big play he made, such as his first interception of the season last weekend.\n\n\u201cI needed that. It was like a gimme,\u201d Lattimore conceded after practice this week. \u201cYou don\u2019t get too many of those in this league, so I\u2019ll take it whenever I can get it.\u201d\n\nLately, Lattimore hasn\u2019t had to discuss many failures in pass coverage, even though he spends significant portions of every game covering opponents\u2019 top receivers. His next challenge comes Sunday in Chicago, whose receiving corps is led by Allen Robinson.\n\nThe last three receivers Lattimore covered - Jacksonville\u2019s DJ Chark, Tampa Bay\u2019s Mike Evans and Dallas\u2019 Amari Cooper - did little to help their teams.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my job. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for,\u201d Lattimore, a 2017 first-round draft choice, said of covering opponents\u2019 best receivers. \u201cI just try my best to make sure they\u2019re not the reason they have potential to win the game.\u201d\n\nLattimore held Chark to three catches for 43 yards - 54 below his average. That was one week after not allowing Evans to make a single catch and limiting Cooper to 48 yards, with no receptions longer than 14.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s drawn some tough assignments and is playing very well,\u201d Saints coach Sean Payton said.\n\nChicago\u2019s Robinson had seven catches for 97 and two TDs in his previous game in Week 5 and is coming off a bye. Bears coach Matt Nagy said he doesn\u2019t want to shy away from throwing to Robinson this week, but that his quarterback has to know that inaccurate or ill-timed throws likely will be punished.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in a top echelon of DBs,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cWe know that.\u201d\n\nLattimore said that when he was giving up more yards and touchdowns earlier this season, it was partly because he would lose focus after quarterbacks went a number of plays in a row without throwing to his side of the field - a victim of his own success, in a way.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not coming my way, but they end up catching me when I was sleeping out there,\u201d Lattimore recalled. \u201cBut that\u2019s when (secondary coach Aaron Glenn) came to me and said, \u2018Just play every play one play at a time so you can stay focused, stay locked in and be consistent.\u2019 So, that\u2019s what I did.\n\n\u201cPhysically, I got everything I need,\u201d he added.\n\nLattimore was raised in the Cleveland area by a single mother who supported her three children by working in a nursing home. When he\u2019d ask for an expensive pair of sneakers, instead of simply saying no, his mother, Felicia, showed him her paycheck and their bills and essentially had him do the math. He respected that, and decided that if he wanted luxury items, he needed to figure out how to get those on his own.\n\nHe also nearly quit football at age 14, when he said he struggled emotionally with the shooting death of a teenage cousin. He said he was lured back to the game by family and friends who recognized his talent and affinity for football.\n\nAnd as Lattimore also concedes, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a plan B.\u201d\n\nHe generally didn\u2019t play other sports, but did run track at high school coach Ted Ginn Sr.\u2019s insistence. Lattimore said he didn\u2019t really enjoy it, and consequently wasn\u2019t great at it.\n\nBut playing cornerback is about much more than straight-line speed. It\u2019s about backpedaling before suddenly turning one\u2019s hips to run stride-for-stride with an accelerating receiver. It\u2019s about leverage, timing, play recognition and route recognition.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always looking to make a play, hungry for the ball,\u201d said safety Vonn Bell. \u201cHe wants to be the best at his position.\u201d\n\nBell, who has known Lattimore since they were teammates at Ohio State, also said the cornerback\u2019s inclination to acknowledge his failures publicly is part of what makes him elite.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what all great players do. They let you know they messed up and they\u2019re going to learn from it,\u201d Bell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does very well and he challenges himself and that\u2019s what makes him become great and makes him become that guy. He just puts his head down and works and then be performs at a high level.\u201d\n\nLattimore exhibits laid-back behavior in the locker room, welcoming conversation but rarely, if ever, raising his raspy voice.\n\nHe said he tries not to get too emotional about instances of success or failure, be it from play to play, or game to game.\n\n\u201cAt corner, it\u2019s ups and downs and it\u2019s a long season. So I can\u2019t really get too happy about one win and one matchup,\u201d Lattimore said. \u201cAfter the season, I can get happy about it.\u201d\n\nAt this rate, he\u2019ll enjoy his next offseason.\n\nNOTES: Running back Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle), tight end Jared Cook (ankle) and receiver Tre\u2019Quan Smith did not practice on Thursday after also sitting out on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Accountability seems to come naturally to Saints cornerback Marshon Lattimore.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brett Martel"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
