The movement even floated its own hashtag: #decencypledge.\n\n\u201cI think zero tolerance for sexual harassment, especially egregious sexual harassment, is a completely feasible goal,\u201d Hoffman told MIT Technology Review in a 2017 interview touting his personal reform efforts.\n\nNow, with his name bubbling up in connection with recent revelations about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s ties to the tech world, Hoffman\u2019s own words may come to haunt him.\n\nIn July, Vanity Fair reported that Hoffman hosted a dinner a few years ago that brought together accused sex trafficker Epstein, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg at a dinner in Palo Alto organized to honor the MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden. Musk and Zuckerberg distanced themselves from Epstein in comments after the story ran, but Hoffman did not.\n\nThen in late August, the LinkedIn cofounder sprang to the defense of Joi Ito, then the director of the MIT Media Lab, who reportedly concealed donations from the convicted multimillionaire sex offender.\n\nIt happened in a testy email exchange that was revealed by the writer Anand Giridharadas, who served on the selection jury for an award given by the lab. Giridharadas, shaken by the revelations of Ito\u2019s ties to Epstein and on the verge of resignation, wrote to Hoffman, Ito, and his fellow jurors requesting that Ito\u2019s correspondence with Epstein be made public.\n\nIto\u2014who not only cultivated Epstein\u2019s patronage of the Media Lab but also took more than a million dollars for his own personal investments\u2014did not respond to Giridharadas. But Hoffman did: The entrepreneur accused Giridharadas of being dramatic, according to the author. \u201cYour responses frankly make me concerned about your ability to serve on an awards committee,\u201d Hoffman wrote.\n\nWhen Giridharadas said that he would step down if Ito didn\u2019t, Hoffman reportedly accused the writer of making it \u201call about you.\u201d\n\nThat Hoffman was the one to respond surprised him. \u201cWhat I later learned from Ronan Farrow\u2019s reporting was that Joi Ito was more responsive on email to a child rapist like Jeffrey Epstein than to mere me,\u201d Giridharadas told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnother of his plutocratic backers, Reid Hoffman, answered in his place.\u201d\n\nIn light of the responses, the writer stepped down from the jury. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to me that anyone affiliated with Epstein will outlast me on [the jury]. And that you [Hoffman] found time in this thread to attack me before you\u2019ve said one word critical of those who abetted a predatory felon of the worst variety by selling him reflected prestige,\u201d Giridharadas tweeted.\n\nThe exchange with Hoffman left a sour taste in Giridharadas\u2019 mouth.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need Reid Hoffman to make the world a better place or fight sexual harassment. We just need him not to use his power and money to enable a plutocratic predator like Jeffrey Epstein by being the part of the legitimizing of him that occurred after his convictions,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nGiridharadas declined to share the entire email chain. Hoffman, the MIT Media Lab, and Greylock did not respond to requests for comment on the exchange or on Hoffman\u2019s public commitments against sexual predation.\n\n\u201cI was asking questions about behavior that Joi apologized for. Why is some independent funder answering questions on his behalf?\u201d Giridharadas told the Daily Beast. \u201cThe answer if part of what has grown out of this whole story. These donors are calling the shots over there.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday, Giridharadas\u2019 name had disappeared from the Disobedience Award\u2019s selection committee website, but Ito\u2019s remained.\n\nITO\u2019S FALL FROM GRACE\n\nIto, an influential figure with a deep Rolodex of contacts in academia and the technology industry, led the MIT Media Lab to global prominence and swelled its coffers with hefty private donations over his eight years as director. He resigned after a New Yorker story revealed Ito had accepted more money from Epstein than previously thought, and made coordinated efforts to conceal these contributions.", "description": "Bloomberg via GettyTwo years ago, when accusations of sexual harassment rocked the venture capital world, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman positioned himself as a moral authority on the issue.Hoffman\u2014a former PayPal executive who is now partner at prominent Silicon Valley firm Greylock, proposed what", "authors": ["Blake.Montgomery Thedailybeast.Com", "Blake Montgomery", "Taylor.Hatmaker Thedailybeast.Com", "Taylor Hatmaker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/69ferZbnlPu.IX8tpq8puQ--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/5fbd6c4a19f28026d79ff248b140c866", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
