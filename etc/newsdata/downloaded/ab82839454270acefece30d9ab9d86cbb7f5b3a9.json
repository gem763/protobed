And you know, they have a majestic presence, they are the iconic symbol of this part of the world. You know you\u2019re someplace different when you\u2019re in a saguaro forest.\u201d\n\nThe species in the park are protected by federal law, so crews are moving saguaros technically within a 60-foot strip of land called the Roosevelt Reservation that the government has access to for border protection, according to Earther.\n\nThe Army Corps of Engineers released a video last month saying that the saguaros and other types of cacti were being relocated to another area considered part of their natural habitat.\n\n\u201cThere may be misconceptions that were are on a construction site and just not caring for the environment and just proceeding with work as planned,\u201d a project engineer said in the clip. \u201cThis isn\u2019t true. We\u2019re taking great care to take care of the protected species.\u201d\n\nThe Hill has reached out to The National Park Service (NPS) and Customs and Border Protection for comment.\n\nThe NPS warned in a 123-page internal memo from July that expanding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border could damage 22 archeological sites, including artifacts from ancient Sonoran Desert peoples.\n\nIt noted previous research that found archaeological sites \u201clikely will be wholly or partially destroyed by forthcoming border fence construction.\u201d\n\nScientists have expressed concern that border wall crews will cause serious damage or dry up the spring if its water is tapped for mixing concrete or other construction purposes.\n\nThe NPCA also argued that the barrier wall will block wildlife like desert tortoises and mountain lions from accessing critical water sources and migration paths.\n\nConstruction has already begun on converting a 5-foot vehicle barrier to the 30-foot-high border wall. The barrier along the border with Mexico was a staple of Trump\u2019s campaign, in which he vowed to complete 500 miles of wall before the 2020 presidential election.", "description": "New video shows protected saguaro cacti at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona being destroyed by bulldozers preparing the site for construction of President Trump\u2019s border wall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/cactus_nps_100719.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
