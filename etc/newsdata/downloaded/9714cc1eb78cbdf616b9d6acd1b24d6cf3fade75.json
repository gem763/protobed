McMillen cautioned, however, that there are many unanswered questions, and said it is unlikely change happens before 2021.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to get solved overnight. This is going to go on for several years,\u201d McMillen said.\n\nAt a meeting in September attended by dozens of athletic directors from across the country, McMillen said, many expressed willingness to allow college athletes to make money similar to how Olympic athletes can, but expressed concern about potential legal implications. The NCAA and its member conferences have emerged largely victorious from federal antitrust lawsuits thanks to judicial rulings that have allowed the NCAA to prohibit payments that are not \u201ctethered to education.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear, McMillen said, is how to tie new revenue opportunities for athletes to education, so as to not make the NCAA or conferences vulnerable to more litigation that would seek an open market for college athletes \u2014 essentially, allowing schools to enter into cash bidding wars for top high school recruits.\n\n\u201cSomewhere along the way it has to be tethered to education,\u201d McMillen said. \u201cDoes that mean they don\u2019t get it until they graduate, or they have to be in good academic standing? There are a lot of nuances and complications to it.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement came after an NCAA working group that has been studying the name, image and likeness issue since May made a preliminary report to the organization\u2019s board. That working group made no specific recommendations on key issues, however, such as whether athletes will be allowed to charge for autographs, and the NCAA said the group needs time for more feedback, after spending five months studying the issue.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve got the board to agree that it\u2019s time for a change,\u201d said Val Ackerman, commissioner of the Big East and a member of the working group examining the issue, in a phone interview Tuesday. \u201cThe question is what exactly does that model look like? That\u2019s where the work comes in over the next couple of months . . . Unfortunately, it\u2019s complicated, and we just need some more time to vet that all out.\u201d\n\nThe National College Players Association, a nonprofit that advocates for expanded income and rights for college athletes, criticized Tuesday\u2019s announcement as largely meaningless.\n\n\u201cI think this is a bit of smoke and mirrors here, which signals that the NCAA is still going to oppose players receiving real compensation,\u201d said Ramogi Huma, executive director of the NCPA and a former football player at UCLA, in a phone interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs California lawmakers considered their bill this summer, Huma said, NCAA officials sought to forestall a vote by pointing out it had a working group studying name, image and likeness opportunities. The fact the NCAA working group still has no specific rule change recommendations, to Huma, should be evidence to elected officials mulling over similar legislation elsewhere to push forward.\n\nLawmakers in more than 10 states have expressed interest in bills similar the one passed in California, and at the federal level, Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) has proposed legislation that would allow college athletes to earn money through name, image and likeness deals, and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has expressed support.\n\n\u201cThese issues are not difficult. What\u2019s difficult for the NCAA is getting all those schools to agree on anything,\u201d Huma said. \u201cI hope state and federal lawmakers see this and know they should go full speed ahead. . . . I don\u2019t think this is going to happen voluntarily.\u201d\n\nRead more on college sports:\n\nAD", "description": "As legislative pressure mounts, college sports\u2019 governing body claims \u2018it is uniquely positioned to modify its rules\u2019 and restates its opposition to California law.", "authors": ["Will Hobson", "National Sports Reporter With A Focus On Accountability"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HijWbp2AFT1psgjZ94_yb4wXKcU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WFXMD6H2QAI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
