And like season 1, the sequel will be based on another true story of love gone so, so wrong.\n\nSeason 2 will span decades, from the 1960s to the \u201980s\u2019, as it focuses on the breakdown of a well-known couple\u2019s marriage, which ends in a double homicide.\n\nAmanda Peet (A Lot Like Love) will star as the titular character, \u201cthe perfect Southern California blonde wife and mother\u201d married to her charming college boyfriend Dan (Mr. Robot\u2019s Christian Slater).\n\nBetty supported Dan through both medical and law school, watching him succeed and sacrificing a bunch in the process. Years later, Dan inevitably makes it big in their local San Diego community and Betty can finally take a breather. But soon things begin to crack after Dan hires Linda Kolkena a \u201cbright, beautiful young woman with whom he can happily forget the struggles of his past.\u201d\n\nYou know where this is going.\n\n\u201cThe first season of Dirty John was a story of twisted love and coercive control and both these insidious elements are also present in and integral to the story of Betty Broderick, whom I have wanted to write about since I became a writer,\u201d series creator Alexandra Cunningham said.\n\nSeason 2 will premiere on the USA Network and hopefully hit Netflix sometime later. You can find Dirty John season 1, starring Connie Britton and Eric Banner, on Netflix now.\n\nIf you want to read more about Betty Broderick, read on. If not, get outta here.\n\nBetty and Dan ended up divorcing, and at the time Oprah Winfrey called it one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s messiest divorces\u201d.\n\nIn 1989 Betty shot dead Dan and his new wife Linda while they slept. Betty didn\u2019t deny that she killed her ex-husband and Linda, but said she was driven to do it after her husband\u2019s treatment of her during their divorce and custody battle over their children.\n\nThe fucked bit is Betty ended up hiring a publicist to tell her side of the story in an attempt to gain the sympathy of women across the country who had been dumped by their husbands for a younger woman. And the thing is, it actually worked.\n\nAccording to a Los Angeles Times report, her first trial in 1991 ended with a hung jury. But Betty was inevitably found guilty of second-degree murder in a second trial. She was sentenced to 32 years to life in prison at the Las Colinas Women\u2019s Detention Facility.\n\nIn 1992, CBS released A Woman Scorned: The Betty Broderick Story which premiered the same month she was sentenced. The LA Times said the film \u201cbecame the second highest-rated TV movie of last season.\u201d\n\nMeredith Baxter, who starred as Betty, received an Emmy nomination for her performance. She also admitted she initially felt sympathetic toward the convicted murderer.\n\nCBS later aired a sequel called Her Final Fury: The Betty Broderick Story, The Last Chapter.\n\nIn 2018, Betty was denied parole for a second time.\n\n\u201cBetty Broderick is an unrepentant woman,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Richard Sachs told the LA Times afterwards. \u201cShe has no remorse and zero insight into the killings.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just basically said, \u2018They drove me to do this.'\u201d\n\nBetty, now 71, was previously denied parole in 2010.", "description": "Dirty John\u00a0season 2 is officially a go with the people behind the highly-rated series revealing its plot and leading cast members.", "authors": ["Steffanie Tan"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/Dirty-John.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
