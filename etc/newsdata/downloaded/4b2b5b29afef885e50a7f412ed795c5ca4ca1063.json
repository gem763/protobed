The cases Tuesday are the court's first on LGBTQ rights since Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement and replacement by Justice Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nA decision is expected by early summer 2020, amid the presidential election campaign. The issue is whether a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that bars discrimination in employment because of sex covers LGBTQ people.\n\nA ruling for employees who were fired because of their sexual orientation or gender identity would have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBTQ workers across the country because most states don't protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBTQ people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school.\n\nKennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative.\n\nThe Trump administration has changed course from the Obama administration and now supports the employers in arguing that the civil rights law's Title 7 does not prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation or transgender status.\n\nPeople have been waiting in line outside the court since the weekend to try to snag the few seats the court makes available to the public for arguments.\n\nThe justices will first hear appeals in lawsuits filed by Gerald Lynn Bostock, who claims he lost his job working for Clayton County, Georgia, after he began playing in a gay recreational softball league. He lost his case in federal district court and at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.\n\nSkydiving instructor Donald Zarda was fired shortly after telling a woman he was preparing to take on a dive that he was gay. Zarda, who worked for Altitude Express on New York's Long Island, said he would sometimes reveal his sexual orientation to allay concerns women might have about being strapped together during a dive.\n\nZarda initially lost his lawsuit, but the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for him. Zarda died in a wingsuit incident in 2014\n\nHis husband Bill Moore told CBS News correspondent Jan Crawford that Zarda suffered from depression after he was fired, and started doing jumps with greater risks.\n\n\"I don't think Don would have died had he not lost his job,\" Moore said. \"I think he would have continued working Summers and sky diving and doing tandems and would not have taken this crazy trip to Europe in the middle of the summer. I think him being fired is eventually what took his life.\"\n\nThe other case involves fired transgender funeral home director Aimee Stephens. She lost her job when she told Thomas Rost, owner of the Detroit-area R.G. and G.R. Harris Funeral Homes, that she had struggled with gender identity issues almost her whole life. She was planning to exchange the dark suit and tie she had worn to work for nearly six years as an embalmer and funeral director for a conservative dress or skirt that was required for women who worked for Rost.\n\nRost told Stephens her plan wouldn't work and let her go. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued on her behalf and, after losing in a district court, won a ruling in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.\n\nDuring the Obama years, the EEOC had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBTQ people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nThe Trump administration and the employers say Congress could easily settle the matter by amending Title 7 to include LGBTQ people. Legislation to that effect is pending in Congress, but is not likely to pass the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nBut the workers contend, and the lower courts that have ruled for them have reasoned, that the law as it stands plainly covers sexual orientation and gender identity because discrimination against them is based on generalizations about sex that have nothing to do with their ability to do their jobs.\n\nThey also argue that they were fired for not conforming to sex stereotypes, a form of sex discrimination that the Supreme Court recognized 30 years ago.", "description": "Cases center on whether federal civil rights law protects LGBTQ people from job discrimination", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/08/a9ba4398-0943-4935-8d2d-8b2857539104/thumbnail/1200x630/220ea1352c768b9a75b57170d9321566/1008-ctm-scotusdiscrimination-crawford-1948096-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
