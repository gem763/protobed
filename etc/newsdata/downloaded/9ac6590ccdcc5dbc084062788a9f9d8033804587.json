But that day she realised just how far 8km could be when you\u2019re worried about an injured loved one.\n\nLiebenette Burger (45), from Somerset West near Cape Town, was at a mall when a woman, Sonja Morkel, called her. Sonja had come across Liebenette\u2019s husband, Leon (49), by the side of the road where he\u2019d been knocked off his bicycle.\n\nThe motorist who\u2019d hit Leon had simply sped off.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful to Leslie and Sonja Morkel who came across Leon. We don\u2019t know them from Adam but Sonja spotted Leon lying in a ditch. The couple immediately made a U-turn at Stellenbosch Square\u2019s robot to go back and help Leon,\u201d Liebenette says.\n\n\u201cI was grocery shopping. I saw Leon was calling me from his cellphone and when I answered and heard a woman\u2019s voice, I immediately knew something was wrong.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t immediately know what Leon\u2019s condition was but Sonja said I needed to come immediately. Leslie called me again and said Leon was badly hurt. I asked him if Leon\u2019s life was in danger and he said he didn\u2019t think so,\u201d Liebenette recalls.\n\nBut she got a few more worrying calls from Leon. After Leslie and Sonja told her of the accident, Leon called her seven more times, saying the exact same thing each time: that he\u2019d been run over.\n\n\u201cAt first I didn\u2019t understand why he kept calling and telling me to come, that he\u2019d been knocked over. Each time I saw his name on my phone\u2019s screen, I got the horrible feeling that he realised he was dying and just wanted to hear my voice one last time.\u201d\n\nShe could follow Leon\u2019s cycling route and location on her cellphone and saw that he was about 8km from the R44 turnoff.\n\n\u201cI sped there at 180km/h with my hazard lights on. I remember thinking at one point that I needed to get there safely and not have an accident. I couldn\u2019t believe 8km was that far away.\u201d\n\nLeon didn\u2019t have any broken bones but because of the impact of the vehicle that hit him, he had serious internal injuries. He couldn\u2019t move when she got there, Liebenette says.\n\n\u201cHe had to use his arm to lift his head and his right leg was badly swollen,\u201d she says.\n\nHe also had short-term memory loss and still can\u2019t remember anything about the accident that happened on 29 September. That\u2019s why he kept calling Liebenette over and over and repeating himself \u2013 he\u2019d simply forgotten that he\u2019d already called her.\n\n\u201cHe also doesn\u2019t have any memory of what happened just before the incident.\u201d\n\nLeon\u2019s doing \u201ca bit better\u201d now, she says. \u201cBut I have to keep reminding myself the doctor said his recovery could take between four and six weeks.\u201d\n\nLiebenette worries about her husband\u2019s memory loss. \u201cThere are moments when I wonder if his memory has completely recovered because sometimes he\u2019ll forget something we spoke about. But I believe he\u2019ll recover completely.\u201d\n\nShe says her husband is making good progress. He\u2019d been to a physiotherapist and even recently rode his bicycle out to the spot where the accident happened.\n\nPolice interviewed Leon in hospital for information on the motorist but because he had amnesia, they said they\u2019d contact him in a month\u2019s time.\n\nLiebenette says there was a side mirror and glass from the vehicle at the scene.\n\nMihlali Majikela from the SAPD confirms an investigation is under way. \u201cNo arrests have been made.\u201d", "description": "She was only 8km away from where her husband was lying next to the road at the R44 turnoff after he\u2019d been knocked off his bicycle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9530/d969223f643844f5b846c9d6d061c7dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
