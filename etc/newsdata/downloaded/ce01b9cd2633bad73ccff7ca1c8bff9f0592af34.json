REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger.\n\nU.S. government data tells a different story: The technology-driven U.S. drilling boom that started more than a decade ago has made the United States a massive producer, but imports of crude oil and petroleum products from the Gulf region last year still flowed in abundantly here\n\n\u201cBy and large, we are still importing quite a bit and not totally immune to the world market,\u201d Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Seznec, a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, said during a call with reporters on Monday.\n\nIran has rejected U.S. charges it was to blame for the attacks, which damaged the world\u2019s biggest crude-processing plant in Saudi Arabia and triggered the largest jump in crude prices in decades.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, shipping about 7 million barrels of crude daily around the globe. The United States, produces roughly 12 million barrels per day, but consumes 20 million bpd, meaning it must import the rest.\n\nMuch of the U.S. shortfall comes from Canada, but some still comes from Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Gulf nations because several U.S. refineries prefer their oil. As an example, the biggest U.S. refinery \u2013 Motiva Enterprises LLC in Port Arthur, Texas \u2013 is half-owned by Saudi Arabia\u2019s state energy company, Saudi Aramco, and is set up for Saudi grades.\n\nOther refineries \u2013 particularly in California here - are isolated from big U.S. oil fields and must also rely on cargoes.\n\nThe mismatch between what U.S. refiners want and what the United States produces means that in 2018, the United States imported an average of 48 million barrels per month of crude oil and petroleum products from the Gulf region, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThat is down about a third from a decade ago, as domestic oil and gas production soared, but roughly the same level as in 1995 and 1996, according to the data.\n\nPhillip Cornell, another senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, who used to advise Saudi Aramco, called Trump\u2019s tweet \u201cnonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a guy who likes hyperbole,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Emerson, president of ESAI Energy LLC, said the Saudi production outage, if it is prolonged, could provide an opportunity for U.S. crude oil producers to expand their overseas markets.", "description": "Amid a flurry of Twitter posts on Monday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump turned to the weekend attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities and assured his audience the United States had become such a big producer it no longer needed oil from the Middle East https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1173560246863876096.", "authors": ["Timothy Gardner", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430604236&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1Q4", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
