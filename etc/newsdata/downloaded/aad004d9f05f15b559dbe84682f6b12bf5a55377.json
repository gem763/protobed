The world is a big place. And, frankly, it needs more people with the capacity to take joy in things and fewer who start from the assumption that the joy should be dissected for close and clinical examination or who believe that the smartest interpretation is the one that says the intended message is the wrongest one. There\u2019s room for Sonny Bunch and there\u2019s room for David\u2019s bunches of sunniness. David should have a pop culture Twitter handle called @ComfortablyUpbeat.\n\nStill, one of the areas where our tastes differ is on the value of spectacle for spectacle\u2019s sake. For instance, David loved the underwater battle scene in Aquaman with the laser sharks and the things with the stuff all over the place. I didn\u2019t.\n\nBut I did like the battle for Winterfell. But not entirely for the reasons David did. Spoilers ahead my friends.\n\nBefore I get to that, I was vexed by how dark it was. Some are blaming the cable companies. On one very narrow and petty level, I welcome any opportunity to vilify the cable companies. But if it was not the producers\u2019 intention to have the first half be downright opaque \u2014 and apparently it wasn\u2019t \u2014 they should have anticipated the problem given that it was undoubtedly the most expensive \u2014 and most anticipated \u2014 battle scene in the history of television. Someone might have said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s look at this the way millions of our biggest fans are going to experience it and make sure it checks out.\u201d\n\nSome other minor notes. Let it be remembered that I was right in my predictions that the Dothraki were going to get wiped out and that the crypt was going to become an abattoir once the Night King deployed his necromancy. I was surprised Brienne and Grey Worm survived because I was pretty confident that the knighting of Brienne and Grey Worm\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m gonna take you to the Bahamas when this is all over\u201d promise were dead give-aways they were going to end up fighting for the dead. In general, I think the producers chickened out by letting so many survive. But maybe they have sufficiently cool plans in store for the remaining episodes that it\u2019ll make sense. I suspected Jaime would survive because there was that almost gratuitous scene enlisting Braun to dispatch her brothers if they should survive. Why have that scene unless they plan on it leading to something?\n\nI agree with David that Arya\u2019s role as the killer of the Night King was long foreshadowed and it didn\u2019t bother me very much (On the other hand, I thought the way they developed Arya\u2019s character over the previous seasons was not well executed for reasons I\u2019ll explain another time). I was a bit shocked when the Night King grabbed Arya\u2019s throat and she didn\u2019t instantly die, which I thought was one of his powers, but maybe I\u2019m missing something there.\n\nOne last criticism of this battle \u2014 and several others \u2014 before I get to why I liked it. As we\u2019ve discussed before, the show has a problem with time and space. Last season, the battle north of the wall seemed to take a few hours. But in that same time period, Gendry ran all the way back to the wall (presumably without getting lost, despite the fact he had never seen snow before and would probably have a hard time retracing his steps). He then told the wildlings watching the wall to send a raven across most of Westeros to Dragonstone, which apparently made it there in record time. Dany took only seconds to decide to fly all the way back to the exact spot to save the day. Even giving every benefit of the doubt, that strained credulity. All the writers needed to do was include a tiny bit of dialogue \u2014 \u201cWe\u2019ve been here for days,\u201d \u201cwe only have a day\u2019s worth of food left,\u201d whatever \u2014 to signal to the viewer that it had been a while.\n\nI\u2019m not a great military expert, but it\u2019s simply not the case that great battles only last a couple hours. The Battle of Verdun lasted ten months. The Battle of Petersburg in the Civil War went on for nine and a half. The Battle of Sevastopol took eight months. I understand that ancient battles were often quicker. Thermopylae took a couple days. But still, the Battle of the Bastards, Hardhome, etc. all started and finished in a few hours \u2014 or seemed to. By no means am I saying that I wish the battle had been dragged out longer in terms of screen time, but I don\u2019t understand why the invasion of Winterfell had to commence almost instantaneously after the ring of fire was lit. If they only signaled that this battle took days or even weeks, there would have been some excellent opportunities for actual dialogue and character development \u2014 some of which could have been plucked from the first two episodes \u2014 that could have heightened the drama and fixed the pacing of all three episodes. It would have made this battle, which in many ways is the climactic moment of the whole series, seem more epic and made the payoff with Arya seem less convenient.\n\nOkay, now, here\u2019s why I liked it. One of the greatest charms of the show, from the very first episode forward, was the way it treated the issue of magic and mysticism. Despite being set in a fantasy world, the characters served as \u201cmoderns\u201d in the sense that they believed the age of magic and dragons were over. This made the political intrigue so much more compelling. The Red Woman was constantly dismissed as a fraud and charlatan because magic isn\u2019t real. Tyrion mocks the idea of White Walkers as if they belonged alongside \u201cgrumkins and snarks\u201d and other folktale creatures only children believe in. Numerous characters belittle the brothers of the Night\u2019s Watch as fools and fear of the Night King as ridiculous because all of that stuff was just superstition. The Maesters of the Citadel, who actually have written records proving it all happened, were overcome with cynicism and weltschmerz. Even Jon Snow was stunned to discover giants are real. Of course, the show also made it clear that this was the wrong take on the situation. Dragons were back, after all. The Red Woman birthed a smoke monster. We knew the Walkers were real. But there was a wonderful tension between these two conflicting understandings of the world the characters \u2014 and viewers \u2014 lived in.\n\nThe reason I liked the battle scene wasn\u2019t for the spectacle per se. Though I definitely dug a lot of it. No, what I liked was how it was the big reveal. The stories of Old Valyria, of magic and myth, dragons and White Walkers, that served as an ancient backdrop for the characters in \u201cthis\u201d time, were in effect made real by this confrontation that will be sung about 1,000 years hence in Westeros.\n\nIn a sense I\u2019ll be a little disappointed if it turns out that I will be able to watch every detail in perfect clarity if I merely toggle the brightness and contrast knobs on my TV. Because I kind of liked how, even though the battle was taking place right before our eyes, the whole thing felt like the stuff of legend and mystical memory. The Dothraki, the fiercest warriors in the world, bravely ride out only to disappear, their flaming swords snuffed out by the cold hand(s) of death, their bravery only half glimpsed, lending it poetic tragedy. The warriors battled through the night \u2014 though it should have been nights \u2014 felling the undead by the thousands. The mist conjured by the night king, blinding the dragons seemed metaphorical to me, like the mists of the past had been for the characters who couldn\u2019t entirely believe that dragons had ever existed in the first place.\n\nThe whole battle seemed deliberately choreographed to send the message: the age of myth and folktale, monsters and magic, isn\u2019t in the shrouded, half-imagined, past we tell our children about. It\u2019s right now. That\u2019s the kind of spectacle I can get behind.", "description": "The whole battle seemed deliberately choreographed to send the message: the age of myth and folktale, monsters and magic, isn\u2019t in the shrouded, half-imagined, past we tell our children about.\u00a0It\u2019s right now.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
