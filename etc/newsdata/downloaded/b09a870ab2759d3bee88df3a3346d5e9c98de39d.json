Westboro celebrates terrorist attacks and gatecrashes military funerals with signs that read, \u2018Pray For More Dead Soldiers\u2019. They picket the funerals of Aids victims holding placards emblazoned with \u2018Fags Go To Hell\u2019. Their abhorrent behaviour is fuelled by the belief that these tragedies are God\u2019s will \u2013 his punishment for humanity\u2019s sins. On the outside of their church in a suburban street in Topeka, Kansas, hangs a banner: GodHatesFags.com.\n\nFor Megan, the Westboro Baptist Church was her family: a close-knit group largely made up of relatives. It\u2019s a family she still loves, even though seven years ago she told them she could no longer subscribe to their hate-filled doctrines.\n\nSoftly spoken and often trailing off because she\u2019s overcome with emotion, Megan, now 33, tells me about that anguished, terrifying November day in 2012 when she and younger sister Grace left the leafy block that had always been their home. Sobbing, they loaded their possessions into a minivan, knowing they would be ostracised by the people most dear to them.\n\nFor Megan, most painful of all was saying goodbye to her indomitable, fiercely religious yet always loving mother Shirley, who had been her mentor, teacher and best friend. \u2018I saw her mouth drop open in a look of shocked horror that will haunt me until I die.\u2019 Even now, Megan is stricken by the grief she caused her mother by leaving. \u2018We were very close. We spent most days together. She called me her right hand. I don\u2019t think she ever thought I would leave, and for most of my life I had never wanted to.\u2019 Megan still sends her mother birthday cards and letters \u2013 each is met with pointed silence.\n\nShirley remains one of Westboro\u2019s staunchest supporters. Megan is now an outcast. Over the past decade, some 20 members, including her two elder brothers Joshua and Zach have left. Each one has been cut off. \u2018[Remaining members] see me as corrupt.\u2019 Her voice trails off. \u2018I try not to think about what they call me.\u2019 Instead, she prefers to focus on her new mission: to fight the kind of hatred and bigotry she lived first-hand and that she recognises in modern life. Her message stresses the importance of dialogue and empathy between people across ideological lines. She lectures in schools and universities and works with law enforcement agencies.\n\nAnd she\u2019s making waves. Her Ted talk I Grew Up in the Westboro Church \u2013 Here\u2019s Why I Left has been viewed almost 8.5 million times online. Next week her hotly anticipated autobiography, Unfollow, will be published. It gives a moving account of her life growing up and the events that transformed her from one of the church\u2019s most outspoken advocates to the peacemaker she is today. It\u2019s already been optioned by Oscar-winning actress and producer Reese Witherspoon for a potential film adaptation.\n\nWith her mother Shirley in 2009, brandishing the placards their family\u2019s Westboro Baptist Church use to spread their hate-filled doctrines\n\nMegan was just five when she joined her family in daily pickets against businesses and churches they considered to be sympathetic to gay and Jewish people \u2013 two communities Westboro has continually targeted. With her siblings she would hold up signs: \u2018Gays Spread Aids\u2019 and \u2018Your Pastor Is A Whore\u2019. Outraged passers-by would scream at them, sometimes pelting them with rocks, eggs \u2013 even bottles of urine. For the family it was proof God was with them. Megan learned \u2018them and us\u2019 early on.\n\nThe family were led by cantankerous founder Fred, a lawyer and radical Baptist preacher who believed the Bible to be factually true \u2013 and that only a predetermined number of people were selected for redemption. He beat, sometimes literally, his religious fervour into his wife Margie and their 13 children, including Shirley, who had 11 children of her own with husband and fellow Westboro acolyte Brent Roper. Thus he created an extended family of staunch believers in his extreme views: that sins \u2013 especially fornication and homosexuality \u2013 were to be punished by God. \u2018We were raised to believe that our way of seeing the world was the only way,\u2019 says Megan. \u2018And that if you weren\u2019t out there holding a sign, you weren\u2019t doing the right thing.\u2019\n\nYet Megan\u2019s home life was paradoxically wholesome. The families lived in a group of ranch-style houses with a shared garden. Her parents were strict, but present and interested. She and her siblings attended regular schools where they were polite and dedicated students. Many of them, including Megan, went on to study law, like her mother and grandfather. Megan and her siblings shared community chores, played Nintendo, watched Star Wars, read Stephen King. \u2018All the normal stuff\u2026 it just sat directly alongside our religious beliefs.\n\nFred Phelps, Megan\u2019s grandfather and founder of Westboro, demonstrating in 1999\n\nAnd there was no doubt what was most important.\u2019 The Phelps family were also fiercely intelligent, which Megan believes was integral to their myopic views. Armed with their law degrees and knowledge of the scriptures, they could argue any Biblical point that reinforced their beliefs. \u2018We had so much confidence in our own way of seeing things that we couldn\u2019t listen to anybody else.\u2019 Megan says that even on 9/11 her response was immediate and instinctive: \u2018I celebrated.\u2019 Westboro believed it was God punishing America for embracing homosexuality.\n\nIn addition to picketing and running their website, Godhatesfags.com, Westboro churned out hate-filled press releases in celebration of Aids, school shootings, famines and plane crashes, using scripture to justify their twisted logic. By 2005 they had also begun picketing the funerals of US marines killed in Iraq and Afghanistan as evidence of God\u2019s punishment of the sins of all Americans. They\u2019d chant songs in celebration of the explosives that had killed the soldiers, as their grieving families passed by. They waved signs saying \u2018Soldiers Die, God Laughs\u2019. Anti-hate groups would descend on Westboro\u2019s picket lines, trying to block them with American flags. Eventually lawsuits for intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy were filed against Westboro. The public outrage they inspired only served to \u2018energise\u2019 them, says Megan. \u2018For us it was: these people are evil; we have to get out there and stand against them.\u2019\n\nToday Megan burns with shame at the suffering she caused. \u2018I try to focus on using my energy to change things, but there are times when I feel so bad. To think what we took from those people. We acted as though it was no big deal. It was, and that is awful.\u2019\n\nShirley was the family\u2019s spokesperson, with Megan her sidekick. Armed with one-liners and Biblical verses, they did chat shows and radio phone-ins. They welcomed journalists into their home, including Louis Theroux, who has made three BBC documentaries about the Westboro Baptist Church, branding them \u2018America\u2019s most hated family\u2019. Megan found Theroux \u2018wily and affable\u2019; they are now good friends.\n\nIt was when Megan joined Twitter in 2008 to broadcast the church\u2019s messages that her life changed irrevocably. Initially the people she encountered on social media were hostile and she relished the fight. But, helped by the distance the internet provides, some conversations would provoke genuine curiosity in Megan. How had her family come to such outrageous conclusions about the world? Soon, there was hardly a moment in the day when Megan wasn\u2019t debating some theological point on Twitter. Without realising it, she was forging friendships. Gradually the seeds of doubt about Westboro\u2019s doom-filled interpretation of the scriptures were being planted. Contradictions were becoming apparent. Through contact with other people online she was beginning to discover empathy.\n\nMegan revisits her home town with Louis Theroux in his latest documentary on the church\n\nMegan was also falling in love. She had begun corresponding with a stranger whom she only knew by his initials CG. He popped up from time to time, asking her such detailed questions that he clearly read all her tweets. \u2018He was never angry, just curious and respectful,\u2019 she says. Soon her heart was flipping every time she spotted his Twitter handle.\n\nOne day he mentioned he enjoyed the online game Words With Friends. She let slip her username. For the next seven months they privately corresponded while playing the game. \u2018It was intoxicating,\u2019 she recalls. As their banter grew, his questions about Westboro became bolder. \u2018Here was this person who was saying things that were reasonable. And I was thinking, \u201cHe is not one of us, but he doesn\u2019t seem evil.\u201d His arguments began to resonate with me.\u2019\n\nThen one night in September 2011, Megan dreamt a tall stranger turned up at the church in Topeka and she ran to embrace him, not caring who saw. Megan woke, shaking. Her secret friendship had to end. \u2018The dream left me with such a sense of yearning, I knew I had to stop talking to CG or it would be the end of me.\u2019\n\nJust before Megan cut ties, CG left enough clues for her to work out his true identity: he was a 39-year-old Norwegian lawyer called Chad Garrett Fjelland, who lived in South Dakota. In one of his last messages to her, Chad told her he loved her but could never join her church. On more than one night, she cried herself to sleep.\n\nWhile Megan\u2019s world had been shifting, the Westboro Baptist Church community had been changing, too. New converts had joined who began to criticise and sideline Megan\u2019s mother and her now ailing grandfather. Her sister Grace had been accused of impropriety for being friends with a married man. The new guard began disseminating fake news to exaggerate the church\u2019s reach \u2013 Photoshopping images so it looked like Westboro were picketing at the Royal Wedding and Whitney Houston\u2019s funeral. \u2018In the past, there was always an explanation from the Bible to justify the church\u2019s actions. And I could go along with that. Now it all felt wrong.\u2019\n\nThen on 4 July 2012, while helping paint a new church member\u2019s basement and distraught by the treatment of her family, Megan had an epiphany: \u2018What if we\u2019re wrong? What if this isn\u2019t The Place led by God Himself?\u2019 Guilt and confusion swept through her, along with one overwhelming thought: she no longer belonged there. It took another four months for Megan and Grace to find the courage to leave. The transition wasn\u2019t easy. \u2018Just after I left, the instinct to hide was paralysing,\u2019 says Megan. \u2018I wanted to hide from the judgment of my family and from a world that I had rejected for so long, a world that had no reason to give me another chance after a lifetime of antagonism.\u2019 The sisters posted an apology for their past on Twitter, knowing this couldn\u2019t undo it. Nevertheless the people Megan had met online \u2013 many of them Jewish or gay \u2013 forgave her and welcomed the apology.\n\nMegan with her husband Chad; they married in 2016\n\nThen there was Chad. The pair finally met in person four months after Megan left Westboro. \u2018It was magical. I knew immediately that I could marry him.\u2019 Their wedding took place in Norway in August 2016. Megan made a wedding album and sent it to her parents, though she doesn\u2019t know if they opened it. Her voice heaves with emotion again. \u2018I was sure that if my parents knew how happy I was, some part of them would be happy for me \u2013 even in spite of their disappointment.\u2019\n\nToday Megan lives in South Dakota with Chad and their daughter Solvi, one. It pains Megan that Shirley has never met her child. She sends photos, which are never acknowledged. In the meantime, she finds inspiration in her mother\u2019s example of hard work and maternal devotion \u2013 even if her own message to the world is different. Sometimes she returns to Topeka, hoping to see her parents, even though she knows she will be shunned.\n\nIronically, Fred Phelps himself was shunned near the end of his life. Suffering dementia, he one day stepped out of the church to address some people who had set up an LGBT charity opposite. \u2018You\u2019re good people,\u2019 he cried out before being hustled back inside. Shortly afterwards he was taken to a hospice to die.\n\nMegan and Grace went to visit him there. He told them he loved them. The encounter gave Megan a huge optimism. She doesn\u2019t believe in God any more. \u2018But that\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not a believer now. I believe in so much \u2013 I believe in people. I believe in hope.\u2019", "description": "Raised in America's most notorious and despised religious group, Megan Phelps-Roper celebrated tragedies as God's punishment\u2026", "authors": ["Bridget Harrison"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/15/19106536-0-image-a-12_1570114303366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
