The move has damaged the cooperative relationship between law enforcement agencies in the two countries, said a statement from China's National Anti-Terrorism Leading Group Office.\n\nThe office urged the US to stop tolerating support for \"East Turkistan\" terrorist forces. It also vowed to continue fighting terrorism and extremism in accordance with law and keep the social situation in Xinjiang stable.\n\nXinjiang has always faced grave threats from terrorism. The measures adopted in the region aim to tackle the problem at the source and are in line with the law.\n\nNo other country has the right to interfere with matters in Xinjiang, which are internal affairs of China, the statement continued. Furthermore, the so-called human rights issues in Xinjiang described by the US do not exist, it went on to say.\n\nThe move has fully exposed the US's double standard on anti-terrorism issues and its intention to interfere in China's domestic affairs, the statement added.", "description": "In a statement filed on Wednesday night, China's major anti-terrorism body strongly condemned the United States' decision to block police units of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps from importing US technology and other vital components, over so-called human rights issues.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/10/5d9e880da310cf3e97a066a8.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
