The Associated Press, Wochit\n\nPolice were still searching Monday for a suspect in a deadly shooting at an off-campus party in Texas, which drew a Sunday vigil that also saw more shots fired.\n\nTwo people were killed and 12 others injured near a Texas A&M campus in Greenville, about 50 miles northeast of Dallas, when shots rang out around midnight early Sunday.\n\n\"When the shots were fired, it was completed chaos as people fled for safety and deputies attempted to locate the shooter,\" Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said.\n\nMeeks said Sunday authorities had not yet identified a suspect but believe there was one male shooter who might have been targeting one of the victims.\n\nHere's what we know Monday:\n\nWhat happened during the shooting at the party?\n\nGunfire erupted as hundreds of people, mostly people in their late teens or early 20s, were at a Saturday Halloween and homecoming party for Texas A&M University-Commerce, though officials have said it was not a school-sanctioned event.\n\nMeeks said the shooter entered through the back door of The Party Venue, about 15 miles from the school's campus, and began firing with a handgun.\n\nAfter shooting a targeted victim, the gunman then began firing at random, Meeks said.\n\nThe rampage caused the 750 people in the venue to flee, including the shooter.\n\n\"The amount of people that were there, the overcrowdedness of it \u2013 it gave the opportunity for this shooter to be able to accomplish whatever he wanted to accomplish,\u201d Meeks said, per the Dallas Morning News. \"When you have this many people in one place, it\u2019s an easy target for somebody.\"\n\nMeeks said deputies were at the venue when the shooting happened, responding to calls about parking complaints. Deputies heard gunshots coming from the back of the building but could not immediately determine whether the shots were fired from inside or outside, Meeks said.\n\nMarkeice Ford said he had just come out of the men's room when he heard six or seven gunshots. He said he ducked to the floor, looked around and saw \"about three dead bodies.\" He said he never saw the shooter.\n\n\"I must have been close to some of it because I got blood all over my clothes,\" he told WFAA-TV. \"I was trying to see if something happened to me because I had blood everywhere.\"\n\nWho are the victims?\n\nFamily members identified one of the victims to local media as Kevin Berry Jr., 23, of Dallas. The other victim is also a male.\n\nAmong the 12 people injured, half were gunshot victims while the other half were trampled or hurt by glass in the chaos, said Sgt. Jeff Haines, a spokesman for the sheriff\u2019s department.\n\nAt least four of the shooting victims were in critical condition Sunday, he said.\n\nBerry\u2019s uncle, Cloyse Caruthers Jr., told the Morning News his nephew was at the party with friends and was not a Texas A&M-Commerce student.\n\n\"I'm more angry than anything,\" he told the newspaper. \"What were they thinking involving innocent people in this mess? He had so much promise.\"\n\nBerry's mother, Nakima Alexander, told WFAA-TV her son was a father of two and expecting another child.\n\nWhat happened during the vigil?\n\nBerry's friends and family gathered Sunday evening at a Dallas park to remember their relative and friend when at least one person opened fire.\n\nDallas police said the shooting stemmed from a \"disturbance\" at the vigil and that no injuries were reported.\n\nAt least one vehicle was struck with bullets as vigil goers ran for cover.\n\nWhat do police know about the shooter?\n\nMeeks said, while the shooter remains at large, he does not pose an immediate public danger.\n\nHunt County Sheriff\u2019s Office Chief Deputy Buddy Oxford said the gunman was wearing a blue hoodie, but did not have a mask or costume on for the party.\n\nOxford also said authorities have not recovered the handgun used in the shooting.\n\n\u201cWe need to get him off the street as soon as possible, and we have very, very little to go on right now,\" Meeks said.\n\nContributing: John Bacon, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/28/texas-shooting-greenville-texas-a-m-party-updates/2483281001/", "description": "Two people were killed and 12 others injured near Texas A&M University-Commerce in\u00a0Greenville at an off-campus party shooting, police say.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
