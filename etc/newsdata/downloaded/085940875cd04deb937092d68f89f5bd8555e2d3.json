'First, starting out in English in the U.S., Pixel 3's on-device AI helps you screen phone calls and avoid spam calls. 'Imagine you're at dinner with family or in a meeting at work and a call from an unknown caller comes in. 'Just tap on 'Screen call' to find out who's calling and why, as well as other information (as prompted by you). 'You'll immediately see a transcript of the caller's responses so that you can then decide whether to pick up, respond by tapping a quick reply (e.g., 'I'll call you back later'), or mark the call as spam and dismiss. The call screen feature allows the phone to answer calls for you when telemarketers call. The user is able to see the call transcribed in real-time on the device's screen 'Processing the call details on-device means these experiences are fast, private to you, and use up less battery.' Pixel users in the U.S. will also be the first to get access to an experimental new Google Assistant feature, powered by Duplex technology, which helps users complete real-world tasks over the phone, like calling a restaurant to book a table. This feature will initially be available later this year in New York, Atlanta, Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area to help people book restaurant reservations and will roll out to other U.S. cities in the future. However, Google addressed the concenrs it coudl fool humans. 'As we develop new calling technologies, we believe it\u2019s critical that we help people understand the context of the conversation. 'We\u2019ll disclose to businesses receiving the call that they're speaking to an automated system, and we have developed controls to protect against spam and abuse, as well as the ability for a business to opt out of receiving calls. 'For Call Screen, we will also let the caller know that a screening service is being used.'\n\nSoon, you'll be able to let Google's facial-recognition technology just pick out photos of your family, including new shots as you take them (though not in the European Union, where privacy regulations are tighter.)\n\nThe stand also has some smart features, offering to set your alarms before bed.\n\nIt the morning , it can show you how your commute is going, and displays this on the always on screen, a hugely useful, if creepy, feature.\n\nOverall, the Pixel 3 is a superb handset.\n\nIt's fast, sleek and everything a flagship device should be.\n\nPair that with Google's smartest version of Android , and it really does give the iPhone XS a run for its money - albeit with some lingering concerns of whether it has got a little too smart for its own good.", "description": "AI seems to permeate every part of its software, from the ability to answer calls for you to being able to almost perfectly predict your morning commute.", "authors": ["Mark Prigg For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/19/21/5215280-0-image-a-53_1539982430361.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-19"}
