I love both countries and I was building peace,\" she said.\n\nGun rights\n\nStarting in 2013, Butina built a bridge to the US through ties between her small Russian gun-rights group and the Republican-aligned NRA.\n\nHer group hosted NRA leaders in Russia and she and her influential Moscow sponsor, Alexander Torshin, attended NRA events and US political gatherings, where they met influential Republicans.\n\nAttending a Trump rally in 2016, Butina was singled out to ask the future president a question about US-Russia relations.\n\nHer social media was full of pictures of her posing with various firearms, endearing her to US gun activists. She became the girlfriend of a mid-level Republican and NRA operative, Paul Erickson.\n\nIn 2016, she enrolled in American University, but prosecutors said she was in regular contact with embassy personnel with intelligence ties.\n\nThey said although Butina was not an employee of any of Moscow's spy services, she knowingly took part in an operation to \"spot and assess\" potential US espionage targets.\n\n\"There is no doubt that she was not simply a graduate student,\" Assistant US Attorney Erik Kenerson told the court.\n\nButina denied it but ultimately agreed to plead guilty to the charges of being an unregistered foreign agent.\n\n\"I humbly request forgiveness. I'm not this evil person depicted in the media,\" she told the court before being sentenced.", "description": "Gun advocate who built network of Republican contacts before spying arrest is expected in Russia within days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/4/26/d9a81a95ab1448dc9ef20609702d3a54_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
