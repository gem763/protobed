The practice, known as resale price maintenance, is illegal and makes it difficult for customers to find good deals.\n\nFender is the world\u2019s biggest maker of guitars and its famous models include the Stratocaster, Telecaster and Precision bass. The California-based company\u2019s models are played by stars such as Eric Clapton, U2\u2019s The Edge and Taylor Swift, and its basic Squier range is popular with beginners.\n\nThe CMA has been investigating Fender since April 2018 and has already fined the company \u00a325,000 for concealing notebooks at its European headquarters in East Grinstead. The watchdog fined Casio \u00a33.7m in August for restricting online discounts for its digital pianos and keyboards.\n\nAnn Pope, the CMA\u2019s senior antitrust director, said: \u201cShopping online can make it much easier to compare prices and hunt down bargains \u2013 this can be especially important for potentially big purchases like a guitar.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cWe take allegations of resale price maintenance very seriously because it removes one of the benefits of the internet of making it easier to quickly find a better price by shopping around.\u201d\n\nThe CMA said guitars make up a big part of the UK market for musical instruments, which is worth \u00a3400m in sales. Online sales of instruments have grown to about 40% of the market, making it important that internet vendors can offer the price they want, according to the CMA.\n\nIt said it had not made a final decision that Fender broke the law and would listen to the company\u2019s version of events before coming to a verdict by the end of the year.", "description": "UK watchdog says minimum sale price made it difficult to find good deals online", "authors": ["Sean Farrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9037d7f610be8337984c1e72a08eff9c7734a427/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6507002ae461d3fb0047ca8242e67a2", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
