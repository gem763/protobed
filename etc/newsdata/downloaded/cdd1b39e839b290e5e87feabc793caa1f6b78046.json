The Army Corps of Engineers is now beginning a contracting process for construction companies to bid on building barriers, both new and refurbished, across stretches of the southwestern United States.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a combination of areas of where there was no barrier previously and areas where we\u2019re replacing existing, older, less capable barrier,\u201d Kenneth Rapuano, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security, told reporters at the Pentagon.\n\nThe official list of deferred military construction projects wasn\u2019t made public until notifications were made to the lawmakers and diplomats whose regions are expected to be impacted. Pentagon officials began informing Congressional members of the plans to raid the funding, about half of which will come from projects inside the states and half will come from projects outside. Both Democrats and Republicans have been critical of reallocating construction funds out of fears that projects in their home states will be targeted.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters the money would not be taken from \u201cfamily housing, barracks or dormitory projects.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Congress gave Trump funding to build just 55 miles of wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but Trump declared a national emergency \u2014 a move aimed at accessing billions of dollars in federal funding without receiving Congressional approval. That decision was widely seen as a last-ditch \u201cnuclear option,\u201d and has since sparked legal challenges and rattled the balance of power in the federal government.\n\nSen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the Trump administration \u201cis trying to circumvent Congressional authority\u201d and said the action should struck down by the courts. \u201cIf it stands, future Presidents will make similar end-runs to try and tap defense dollars for anything a President wants to label a \u2018national emergency,\u2019\u201d Reed said, adding: \u201cWith this move, President Trump is short-changing our troops and taxpayers and forcing them to bear the burden of his broken, preposterous campaign promise.\u201d\n\nThe Pentagon has developed different accounting schemes to pay for the wall. It has already taken $2.5 billion that had been allocated for military personnel and transferred it into a counter-drug account, a move that gave the military authority to take measures to support federal law enforcement efforts to stop drug trafficking, such as building barriers. That money is now being used to build more than 120 miles of border wall.\n\nThe Sierra Club, American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Border Communities Coalition are currently challenging the decision in the courts. However, the Supreme Court said last month in a 5-4 vote that wall construction can continue while the federal appeals process plays out.\n\nIt may still be tricky for the Pentagon to launch wall construction projects across the entirety of the 2,000-mile southwestern border. Some of the land is private, while other areas belongs to the federal government. The easiest places to build will be along military property like the Barry Goldwater Air Force Range in Arizona. But even then, Pentagon officials said, construction wouldn\u2019t be able to begin for three months or more.\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s border mission is now expected to last well into 2020 and perhaps beyond, the officials said. There are now about 5,700 troops, including 2,000 members of the National Guard, deployed along the southwest border.\n\nThe U.S. military has been forbidden to take part in domestic law enforcement since the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Service members can only assist, and that\u2019s exactly what they have done since Trump directed the military to support DHS on the border more than a year ago.", "description": "The Pentagon plans to tap into billions set aside for military construction projects and funnel it toward building a wall on the U.S. border.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0rmScVL43Km8kt5HylQIrQ--~B/aD0zMjAwO3c9NDgwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/1fe8043dce50c9eb336bab1cfd3c4394"}
