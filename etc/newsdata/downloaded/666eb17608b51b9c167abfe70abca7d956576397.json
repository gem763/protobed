They\u2019re the best team in the country on form,\" said Lampard. \"It\u2019s a great test for us and we need to be ready for it.\"\n\nAre Leicester, West Ham for real?\n\nThe early-season form of Chelsea, Tottenham, Manchester United and Arsenal has given hope to the rest of the league that breaking the glass ceiling of the top six is a realistic goal.\n\nLeicester and West Ham are tied with those four on eight points from their first five games and have the chance to prove their top-six credentials at home this weekend.\n\nTottenham travel to Leicester after blowing a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 away to Olympiakos on Wednesday and have a quick turnaround before facing the Foxes on Saturday lunchtime.\n\nUnited beat Leicester last weekend for just their second win in 10 league matches. But the Red Devils have not won away since their thrilling Champions League triumph at Paris Saint-Germain in March and travel to a West Ham side unbeaten in their past four league games.\n\nEmery needs signs of progress\n\nArsenal emerged from the summer transfer window with renewed hope and expectation of ending a three-year exile from the Champions League.\n\nDespite significant backing, manager Unai Emery has been unable to find the right balance between defence and attack.\n\nThe Gunners let a 2-0 half-time lead slip away at Watford last weekend and were left hanging on for a 2-2 draw as the Hornets had 31 shots on goal -- the most Arsenal have ever faced in the Premier League.\n\nA break clause in Emery's contract means he can be let go at the end of the campaign and, into his second season, the Spaniard needs to start showing signs of progress quickly.\n\nAston Villa's visit to the Emirates offers the perfect chance for a reassuring three points, but Emery can ill afford another slip-up.\n\nFixtures (all times GMT)\n\nFriday\n\nSouthampton v Bournemouth (1900)\n\nSaturday\n\nLeicester v Tottenham (1130), Burnley v Norwich, Everton v Sheffield United, Manchester City v Watford (all 1400), Newcastle v Brighton (1630)\n\nSunday\n\nCrystal Palace v Wolves, West Ham v Manchester United, (both 1300), Arsenal v Aston Villa, Chelsea v Liverpool (both 1530)", "description": "The Premier League's elite have little time to lick their wounds from a series of blows in European competition as domestic action offers an immediate chance of redemption for Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham.
