The other half went for Democrat Barack Obama in 2012 and Republican Trump in 2016. The Iowa focus group had only Obama-Trump voters.\n\nTrump thoughts\n\nThere was widespread agreement with the statement that Trump should do more on clean energy innovation to reduce carbon emissions. On a scale of zero to 10 (zero being don't agree at all and 10 being strongly agree), most voters ranked this around a 7 or higher.\n\nIowa voter Jamison Painter is unconvinced that climate change is as big of a problem as most Democrats (and also scientists, to be clear) have said it is. But\u2026\n\n\u201cI think Trump could probably do a little bit more, to be honest,\u201d 44-year-old Painter told me in a phone interview after the focus group last week in Sioux City, Iowa. \u201cI think he\u2019s kind of ignoring the problem.\u201d\n\nHe supports Trump withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement, but not his move to drastically reduce the size of protected land in Utah known as the Bears Ears monument: \u201cThat\u2019s just not necessary.\u201d\n\nHe voted for Obama twice, but became disenchanted with the Democratic Party as it moved left in recent years. Painter voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to do so again in 2020. The president\u2019s position on climate and energy isn\u2019t a top concern for him.\n\nWisconsin resident Meghan voted for Trump in 2016 because she didn\u2019t like Clinton, but she disagrees with Trump on these issues. \u201cHe is taking his own opinion and not the research and what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d Meghan said during the Appleton, Wis., focus group in March.\n\nWeird weather\n\nThere was general agreement with the statement that the weather is getting weirder, and some connected it to climate change. On the 1-10 scale of agreeability, most voters ranked this a 6 or higher.\n\nErin Grace, a 37-year-old Iowa resident, told me in an interview after the focus group that she thinks human activity is probably driving the weird weather, including extreme flooding and shifted seasons.\n\nBecause of this, Grace says, she ranks energy and climate issues a seven in terms of voting importance. She\u2019s a Democrat and isn\u2019t sure who she is going to vote for in 2020.\n\nAnother Iowa voter, Christine, said in the focus group that Iowa\u2019s recent floods may be linked to Arctic ice melting. \u201cThe water maybe comes from there,\u201d she said.\n\nSurveys are just starting to show a relationship between climate change and extreme weather in the public\u2019s eye, according to Anthony Leiserowitz, an expert in climate communications at Yale University. But\u2026\n\n\u201cWorry about global warming and support for action is still far more dominated by political party and ideology,\u201d Leiserowitz says.\n\nGreen New Deal and other policies\n\nThe vast majority of these voters don\u2019t know much about the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal calling for drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions alongside broader economic goals, like federal jobs guarantees and universal health care.\n\nGrace from Iowa says she didn\u2019t know anything about it, but that it \u201csounds positive.\u201d\n\nPainter also from Iowa described the Green New Deal as \u201cradical.\u201d\n\nVoters were mixed about whether they would support relatively small increases in electricity costs to address climate change.\n\nWisconsin voter Debbie Woeshnick said during the focus group that she wouldn\u2019t support a $10 monthly fee on her utility bill because she thinks \u201cthe government should take care of it.\u201d Woeshnick was one of five voters in the room who opposed such a fee; seven supported it.\n\nIowa voter Lori Knight said she would be worried about what the government would do with the money, a concern the entire room of Obama-turned-Trump voters shared.\n\nThe bottom line: Energy and climate change seem to be rising in the minds of America\u2019s swing voters, but the extent of concern appears less intense than many might otherwise assume if you just watch Twitter or cable news.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: I\u2019ll be reviewing these focus groups at least once or twice more through the 2020 elections, so let me know what you think by emailing me at amy@axios.com.\n\nEditor's note: This story was updated to include the correct city where the Iowa focus group took place. It was Sioux City, Iowa; not Sioux Falls, which is in South Dakota.", "description": "Energy and climate change seem to be rising in the minds of America\u2019s swing voters.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/BikkddliomZAgUOvaM9KRyfjjYs=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/05/10/1557519515130.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-13"}
