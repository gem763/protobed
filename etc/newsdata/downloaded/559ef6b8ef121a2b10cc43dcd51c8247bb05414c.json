Her memoir, \u201cTough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,\u201d is being published this week. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)\n\nShe should have listened to her mother.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have to go on the shows?\u201d Lois Dickson Rice asked her daughter, Susan, in September 2012. \u201cWhere is Hillary?\u201d\n\nSusan Rice was then the United States ambassador to the United Nations, equipped with a gold-standard Washington r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u2014 Stanford, Rhodes scholar, Oxford doctorate, former assistant secretary of state for African affairs. She explained that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was \u201cwiped after a brutal week.\u201d The Obama White House asked Rice to appear \u201cin her stead\u201d on all five Sunday news programs.\n\nIt was days after attacks in Libya killed four Americans.\n\n\u201cI smell a rat,\u201d said her mother, a lauded education policy expert. \u201cThis is not a good idea. Can\u2019t you get out it?\u201d\n\n\u201cMom, don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d Rice said. \u201cI\u2019ve done the shows. It will be fine.\u201d\n\nWell, no, it was not.\n\nBenghazi became the millstone in Rice\u2019s stellar career. It stopped her from succeeding Clinton.\n\nCriticism of Rice was relentless after the intelligence talking points she was given proved incorrect and inadequate. She said the attacks were a spontaneous protest, but the government inquiry was still evolving, and later determined that some individuals were affiliated with terrorist groups. The scrutiny lasted through multiple congressional investigations.\n\nThe aftermath took a punishing toll on Rice\u2019s family and professional reputation, she reveals in her frank new memoir, \u201cTough Love.\u201d The book also explores how, despite Rice\u2019s many accomplishments during two administrations, she attracted criticism for her brusque manner. And Rice faces an extra challenge \u2014 she\u2019s been forced to grapple with whether any of this adversity was somehow a result of her race and gender.\n\n\u201cThe combination \u2014 being a confident black woman who is not seeking permission or affirmation from others \u2014 I now suspect accounts for why I inadvertently intimidate some people, especially certain men,\u201d she writes, \u201cand perhaps also why I have long inspired motivated detractors who simply can\u2019t deal with me.\u201d\n\nIn the immediate wake of the tragedy, Rice became the administration\u2019s face of Benghazi, though other officials were more directly involved in oversight in Libya. \u201cEither incompetent or untrustworthy,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said of her. \u201cI was irresistible to Fox News,\u201d she writes. \u201cStill, I wasn\u2019t prepared for the attacks on me escalating after the election.\u201d\n\nBeing in the vortex, \u201cI don\u2019t think I understood at the time how traumatic it was for my family,\u201d says Rice, 54, in her stately, color-saturated Washington home in the Palisades neighborhood, decorated with art from Africa, Gullah baskets from South Carolina, and a massive portrait of Miles Davis.\n\nHer daughter, Maris, then 9, experienced hallucinations, \u201cmen coming out of walls,\u201d Rice writes, from the trauma of seeing her mother constantly excoriated in the news. Rice\u2019s mother, recovering from cancer surgeries and a stroke, \u201cwas losing her mind,\u201d Rice says. \u201cShe was furious and obsessed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Rice says, \u201cI had a hugely intense job to do, and I didn\u2019t have the option to go \u2018woe is me\u2019 and leaving Syria and North Korea and all of the issues that we were working on at the U.N. on ice.\u201d\n\nYet, the distress experienced by her daughter and mother \u201cbrought me crashing down to earth,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe attacks on her bring up uncomfortable issues of race and gender,\u201d says Ben Rhodes, who served as one of Rice\u2019s deputy national security advisers. \u201cAs a black woman, she was a ripe target. Her critics often have villains who are women and people of color.\u201d\n\nDoes Rice feel she was targeted for those reasons? \u201cThere are those who have reacted to me, at different times, through that prism. But I\u2019m also careful not to be quick to ascribe every bad thing that happens to me to racism and sexism,\u201d she says. \u201cMore significant was my perceived closeness to Obama \u2014 and that this was a way of getting at him.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama and national security adviser Susan Rice walk between events during the November, 2015, G-20 summit in Antalya, Turkey. (Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn December 2012, Rice withdrew her name for consideration as secretary of state, though she believes \u201cwe would have won\u201d confirmation \u2014 the Senate then controlled by Democrats. It wasn\u2019t worth the ensuing \u201cdemolition derby,\u201d she writes. Her son Jake cried, \u201cYou are not a quitter.\u201d Her younger brother told her that, during Benghazi, she had \u201cacted like a girl,\u201d she writes, and that \u201cI put everyone else\u2019s interests above my own. I didn\u2019t promote or campaign for myself the way a guy would have.\u201d\n\nInstead, Rice became Obama\u2019s national security adviser and worked on the Iran nuclear deal, relations with Cuba and the Paris climate agreement.\n\nMonths after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, he accused Rice of a crime, with no evidence \u2014 of trying to learn the identities of his campaign associates contained in classified intelligence reports. The blistering criticism from the right began anew. \u201cI think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story,\u201d Trump said.\n\nDuring the past three years, Rice has watched the unraveling of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy accomplishments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fun,\u201d she says. \u201cThe decision to undo all these are made not out of an alternative strategy or objective but seemingly out of spite.\u201d She\u2019s concerned about America\u2019s international standing. \u201cThe world now is going to have reason to doubt our constancy,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re, in essence, playing ping-pong with each change of party, why would anybody commit to a binding agreement with us? Why would they view us as a reliable partner?\u201d\n\n\n\nSusan Rice and brother John as children. (Family photo)\n\nRice is a child of Washington's power elite. Her father, Emmett, was an economics professor at Cornell and became a governor of the Federal Reserve. Her mother, the child of a Maine janitor and seamstress, became known as \"the godmother of the Pell Grants,\" which she helped develop as vice president of what is now the College Board. (Susan Rice's father died in 2011, and her mother in 2017.)\n\nIt was rarefied air. Her family, she says, was \u201cexceptional even before you get to being African American. It was a huge, huge blessing.\u201d Her mother told her and her brother, John, a former NBA executive who heads a leadership nonprofit, \u201cnever use race as an excuse or an advantage.\u201d The overall message, Rice writes: \u201cJust best them all.\u201d She was one of six black students in her graduating class of about 60 girls at the National Cathedral School.\n\n\u201cHer mother broke down when Susan said she was going to Stanford instead of Harvard,\u201d says lifelong friend Andrea Worden. \u201cThis was the stuff of crises. That was her teenage rebellion.\u201d\n\nWhen Rice\u2019s parents launched a bitter custody battle, it was the late activist and philanthropist Peggy Cooper Cafritz who made sure 10-year-old Susan and her brother didn\u2019t have to testify before a judge. When Rice was deciding whether to attend law school, it was Eleanor Holmes Norton, then a Georgetown Law professor before becoming D.C.\u2019s U.S. House delegate, who advised her to distinguish herself, asking, \u201cAnd how many black PhDs in international relations do you know?\u201d And it was Madeleine Albright, her mother\u2019s close friend and future first female secretary of state, who served as an early mentor and Rice\u2019s eventual boss in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cI think she is one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met. She has this peripheral vision,\u201d Albright says. \u201cShe is very straight about things. She doesn\u2019t couch her words in any ifs and buts.\u201d\n\n\n\nSusan Rice after graduating from Stanford in 1986, with parents Lois and Emmett and brother John. (Family photo/Family photo)\n\nRice has a reputation for being more respected than liked. Her background is in policy, not the popularity contest of politics. \u201cI\u2019m not setting out to alienate people,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople who are so intent on being liked may not have the fortitude to do the right thing \u2014 or the tough thing.\u201d\n\nAs undersecretary, Rice gave the middle finger to then-U.N. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke \u2014 \u201ca classic bully,\u201d she writes \u2014 after he mocked her in front of six U.S. ambassadors to Africa who reported to her. When she called the secretary of state to admit what she had done, Albright laughed, asked for elaboration, then responded, \u201cGood for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, she can be tough. She can push you. Yes, she can be short,\u201d says Rhodes. \u201cShe determined early on, as an African American woman, that she couldn\u2019t just be like everyone else. She had to find her own voice, and if she wasn\u2019t going to be invited into the room, she was going to have to kick down the door. \u201d\n\nObama administration staffers recall her kindness and interest in their lives \u2014 she made sure her staffers could balance work and family. \u201cSusan\u2019s got this big reputation for being firm and fierce and direct,\u201d says Gayle Smith, former National Security Council senior director for development and democracy. \u201cDespite all these big jobs, she has never stopped holding up her side of her friendships.\u201d Avril Haines, another of Rice\u2019s deputy national security advisers, says, \u201csome of the criticism was sexist. I found that she was this extraordinarily generous person.\u201d\n\nRice describes herself as \u201can inveterate tomboy,\u201d and her memoir is packed with sports analogies. One childhood nickname is \u201cSpo,\u201d short for Sportin\u2019. Worden dispels her 5-foot-3 friend\u2019s reported aptitude for basketball.\n\n\u201cSusan\u2019s prowess as a point guard is an urban legend,\u201d Worden says. Rice wasn\u2019t all that great, her friend says, but she was \u201cscrappy. She dove for every single loose ball on the floor. She was not going to give up.\u201d\n\nHer husband and college sweetheart, Ian Cameron \u2014 a former executive producer of ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d who is a reading tutor and a board member of the literacy nonprofit Reading Partners \u2014 arranged to have Aretha Franklin perform at Rice\u2019s 50th birthday party. Rice loves to dance.\n\n\u201cWe have all sorts of discussions about hair, food and movies,\u201d Albright says. \u201cWe also have policy discussions.\u201d Indeed, during our interview Rice discusses her makeup, the trademark navy eyeliner (\u201cone eyeliner color, one lipstick shade, makes it easier\u201d) and how she enjoys her post-administration uniform of yoga pants.\n\n\n\nRice\u2019s new book. (Simon & Schuster)\n\nLate in the afternoon, her son, Jake, arrives home. A college senior, he is the former head of the Stanford College Republicans and helped organize a \u201cMake Stanford Great Again\u201d event.\n\n\u201cI confess it can be deeply painful to love someone so powerfully with whom I disagree so profoundly,\u201d she writes. Mother and son decline further comment. Maris, a high school junior, has moved politically to the left of her parents, Rice says.\n\nIn 2018, Rice flirted briefly with running for the U.S. Senate from Maine against Susan Collins, after the Republican senator supported Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination. She is no fan of Collins, writing that hers was \u201cthe most disingenuous meeting I had\u201d discussing Benghazi on Capitol Hill.\n\nRice decided it was not her time. She has the book, and a lengthy promotional tour, as well as visiting fellow appointments at American University and Harvard. Rice is open to working in philanthropy, possibly heading a foundation, or working on a start-up. She\u2019s a member of Netflix\u2019s board, and wouldn\u2019t mind joining others.\n\nSeveral Democratic candidates have asked for her help on foreign policy. Diplomatically, she doesn\u2019t mention names. If the Democratic candidate wins in 2020, would Rice return to government service?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to make it to the top of my field,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you know, I\u2019m good. My bar for coming back is really high.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nKamala Harris grew up in a mostly white world.
