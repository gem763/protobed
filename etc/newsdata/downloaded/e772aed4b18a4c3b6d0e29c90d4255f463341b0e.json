The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro Max would, given the price, cost even more.\n\nApple unveiled the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max on Tuesday. They will be 5.8 inches and 6.5 inches, respectively, and will have four and five extra hours of battery life. And the starting price? $699.\n\nThe $300,000 lifetime cost figure is based on the average amount spent per year in the U.S. on cellphones, and the average returns you\u2019d make on that money if you invested it instead from age 18 to age 78 and upgraded every 32 months. That number is also in constant dollars \u2014 in other words, it\u2019s after accounting for inflation. Based on current average pricing, that puts your total expense at $12,474.\n\nAmericans also spend approximately $88 a year on apps and unlimited data plans typically cost around $80 a month.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Apple Announces the iPhone 11 With New Cameras and Colors\u2014and a New Price\n\nPut that money into an investment account, and factor in long-term returns of around 4% a year after inflation, and you reach that $300,000.\n\nAs with all calculations, there are plenty of assumptions about average users. But they help show the value of reducing these bills. Based on these calculations, someone who buys a cheap $150 Android phone every two years, and switches to a $20 a month plan, would add more than $200,000 to their retirement account.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t matter for anyone who is as rich as Croesus (or Jeff Bezos), but it might for plenty of others.\n\nAlas, nearly 40% of families have less than $10,000 in financial assets and about half are at risk of serious financial trouble in retirement. Those estimates are after near-decade-long boom in stock and bond prices. According to a study by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, about half of people nearing retirement have no retirement savings.", "description": "That\u2019s how much you would make if you invested the money you spent on your smartphone from the age of 18 to 78.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX519_youngb_ZG_20181101120651.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-01"}
