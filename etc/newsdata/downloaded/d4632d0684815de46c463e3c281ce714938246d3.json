Adam Schiff is a poor man\u2019s Harry Houdini. He is a cheap illusionist performing amateurish parlor tricks of deception in his quest to convince his audience that he possesses damning evidence of an impeachable offense committed by President Trump.\n\nSchiff, D-Calif., has no such evidence, of course. But like most illusionists, Schiff employs misdirection and confusion. He attempts to convince you that opinions are evidence, while facts are not. This is the stuff of rank political magic where perceptions are distorted through clever manipulation of the process.\n\nSchiff has become the master manipulator aided, in large part, by the secrecy of his faux magic act. He won\u2019t allow you to peek behind the curtain to see for yourself the witnesses he has called in his \u201csuper top secret\u201d impeachment inquisition. You are never permitted to view transcripts of depositions or examine testimony that purports to incriminate the president. That, of course, would ruin all the hocus-pocus.\n\nDAVID BOSSIE: BASELESS TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY BY DESPERATE DEMOCRATS MAKES DRAMATIC FLIP-FLOP\n\nRepublicans have spent weeks trying to pierce the veil of secrecy. They have now partially succeeded by pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., into a resolution for a full House vote on the heretofore partisan and unjust proceedings that are bereft of due process. At the very least, this new action will establish some fundamental rules of fairness and transparency that are the bane of pretend-illusionists like Schiff.\n\nAmericans will finally get to see how the House Intelligence Committee chairman rigged his inquisition with hearsay witnesses and others who had nothing meaningful to offer except their own personal interpretations of a July 25 conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe best evidence of what transpired is, in fact, the only pertinent evidence. Everything else is secondary and immaterial. The transcript of the telephone call and the statements of the two participants, Trump and Zelensky, are the only relevant evidence. All other witnesses are simply offering their gratuitous interpretation and opinion of the conversation to which they were not a party.\n\nTake, for example, William Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine. Schiff and his confederates leaked to their friendly media outlets that Taylor testified that Trump wanted to withhold U.S. military aid unless Zelensky vowed to investigate alleged Ukrainian meddling in the U.S. election and possible corrupt acts by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nBut wait. It appears that Taylor\u2019s testimony was not based on any first-hand knowledge. Instead, it seems to have been his interpretation derived from conversations by others who had no first-hand knowledge. In other words, it was conjecture built on speculation. How\u2019s that for reliability?\n\nSchiff, the illusionist, can offer nothing but impressions, perceptions, judgments and opinions. It is all irrelevant and a sham. Facts are what matter.\n\nAnother example was the much-anticipated testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who oversees Ukraine policy at the National Security Council. Vindman listened in on the telephone conversation and then expressed his \u201cconcern\u201d to his superiors about its propriety inasmuch as Joe Biden\u2019s name was mentioned. But hold on. Isn\u2019t that his judgment or opinion? It most certainly is.\n\nVindman said, \u201cI did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen.\u201d He can perhaps be forgiven for not knowing that the U.S. quite often enlists the assistance of foreign governments in investigations, many of them involving U.S. citizens.\n\nStill, Vindman is offering nothing more than his opinion, and a mistaken one at that. His interpretation of what he thinks is \u201cproper\u201d in a phone call has no greater value simply because he heard it instead of reading it.\n\nAnyone with computer access can download and read the transcript while forming their own opinion. What is indisputable are the facts contained in the transcribed conversation.\n\nNowhere is there a reference to a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d of U.S. military aid in exchange for an investigation of the Bidens or anyone else. There is no demand, no condition and no pressure.\n\nZelensky is on record stating there was no blackmail involved during the call and no pressure applied. \u201cNobody pushed me,\u201d Zelensky said. \u201cWe had a great phone call,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was normal.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian government has confirmed that it did not even know that the U.S. had suspended security funds until almost five weeks after the call with Trump. This seriously undermines the argument by Democrats that there was a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for the aid.\n\nIt is impossible for there to be a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d when the recipient of the \u201cquid\u201d is oblivious to the existence of the \u201cquo.\u201d This is common sense, which is in short supply these days in the bowels of the House basement where Schiff pursues his \u201csuper top secret\u201d inquisition.\n\nIt is folly for Democrats to argue that a diplomatic conversation of this nature somehow constitutes an impeachable offense. Schiff, the illusionist, can offer nothing but impressions, perceptions, judgments and opinions. It is all irrelevant and a sham. Facts are what matter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA hundred so-called \u201cwhistleblowers\u201d relying on hearsay about a conversation to which they were never privy cannot change the factual equation laid bare by the transcript of the Trump-Zelensky telephone call.\n\nNot even the great Houdini could pull off that trick.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GREGG JARRETT", "description": "Rep.
