An operative with LaRouche made headlines overnight after standing up at AOC\u2019s town hall in Queens and saying that humanity should eat babies, among other ridiculous things, to address the climate crisis.\n\nViral video from the incident shows a woman posing as a supporter of AOC and wearing a shirt that reads, \u201cSave the Planet, Eat the Children.\u201d Many people clearly thought she was mentally disturbed, but LaRouche PAC, a fringe organisation that believes climate change is a hoax, was behind the stunt, according to the group\u2019s Twitter account.\n\n\u201cI think your next campaign slogan has to be this: \u2018We have got to start eating babies,\u201d the unnamed woman says, according to video captured by C-SPAN.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy that you are really supporting a Green New Deal, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d the woman told Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez as others in the room looked on in confusion. \u201cEven if we were to bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution. So we have to get rid of the babies. That\u2019s a big problem. Just stopping having babies is not enough. We need to eat the babies.\u201d\n\nAOC can be seen trying to calm the woman down, repeatedly saying \u201cit\u2019s ok,\u201d and ignoring the comments about babies. While the woman\u2019s reference to \u201cbombing\u201d Russia may seem odd, the group supports both President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cIt was us,\u201d the LaRouche organisation tweeted Friday, in response to a question about whether the woman was serious. \u201cMalthusianism isn\u2019t new, Jonathan Swift knew that. Sometimes, only satire works.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump got into the fray Saturday, tweeting \u201cAOC is a Wack Job!\u201d in response to the viral video. Trump likely had no idea that the woman in the video was one of his supporters.\n\nThe connection of this stunt to LaRouche was first noted by London-based Matthew Sweet, author of the book Operation Chaos, which looks at conspiracy theorists of the late 1960s, including Lyndon LaRouche Jr., the late cofounder of the group. LaRouche, who was perhaps best known for his antisemitic conspiracy theories, died this past February. LaRouche claimed that Jews were actually funding the KKK and said that the Queen of England wanted to have him killed.\n\n\u201cIt is textbook stuff,\u201d Sweet told Gizmodo via Twitter DM, referring to yesterday\u2019s bizarre stunt. \u201cThey have been in this game for decades.\u201d\n\nSweet notes that the group did something similar to 1988 presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, spreading leaflets that he was mentally unwell and had visited a psychiatrist. The campaign made national headlines and Dukakis was forced to release medical records refuting the claim.\n\nAside from yesterday\u2019s outburst, LaRouche PAC has been trying to get \u201ceat children\u201d satire out in other street-level engagements to discredit the environmental movement. The group posted photos to Facebook on October 3 that shows people with signs like \u201cEat the Children,\u201d as well as other more earnest messages in support of Donald Trump.\n\nGizmodo reached out to LaRouche PAC Saturday but has not heard back. We\u2019ll update this post if we hear anything from the group.", "description": "LaRouche PAC, a far-right group that supports Donald Trump, has taken credit for trolling U.S. Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during a town hall meeting Friday.
