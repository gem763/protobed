In recent years, the European Union has partnered with the coast guard and other Libyan forces to try to stop the dangerous sea crossings.\n\nRights groups, however, have criticized those efforts, saying they\u2019ve left migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centers rife with abuses.", "description": "Libya\u2019s coast guard says it has intercepted more than 100 Europe-bound migrants off the country\u2019s Mediterranean coast.
