Compounding this, he said, is the excuse that the organisation was helpless, \"making pretend\" that they couldn't have prevented an attack as it originated from an advanced adversary.\n\nSpecial feature Cyberwar and the Future of Cybersecurity Today's security threats have expanded in scope and seriousness. There can now be millions -- or even billions -- of dollars at risk when information security isn't handled properly.

In many cases, it's both of these things at work,\" he said.\n\n\"There's spear-phishing because somebody is using poor passwords, and their underlying system they're being spear-phished from still has known, unpatched gaps.\"\n\nSee also: 10 tips for new cybersecurity pros (free PDF) (TechRepublic)\n\nRather than saying an organisation was the victim of a breach at the hands of a nation-state adversary, and pretend it was highly sophisticated, Yoran said the better conversation to have would be around why there was a breach.\n\n\"Was it something that was truly unpreventable or were you simply being lax and negligent in how you manage your systems?,\" he said.\n\n\"The truth is that preventing these things is exceptionally straightforward -- I'm not saying that it's easy to do, but it's at least straightforward ... the thing you have to do to protect yourself is maintain good hygiene with systems ... and users.\n\n\"If you can do those two things, you are in far better shape and I would say it's extremely unlikely you'll get breached -- and you certainly won't get breached with any of the popular techniques we're seeing today from nation-state actors or cybercriminals.\"\n\nBefore landing at Tenable as its CEO, Yoran had spent time within the US Department of Defense and previously served as founding director of the US-CERT program in the US Department of Homeland Security. Prior to that he was the president of network security firm RSA, as well as the co-founder and CEO of Riptech, which was acquired by Symantec in 2002.\n\nHaving spent 25-plus years in the security industry, Yoran made an observation that organisations are throwing money at security solutions \"to no end\", when what is actually required is a more disciplined approach to managing systems and users.\n\n\"I would say most of which you see from the security industry is a bunch of smoke mirrors, and hype ... there's no point in installing a super sophisticated security system when you aren't locking your door or closing your front door to begin with,\" he added.\n\nAs the number of exposed breaches grow, particularly with regulated requirements to disclose any activity relating to the personal data of people, Yoran said there is a sense of tolerance in the world.\n\n\"We're certainly breeding a sense of tolerance that may be counter-productive,\" he said. \"I'm hopeful -- I'm optimistic -- that as we get more transparency, not just that you were breached, but how you were breached ... that we start seeing what is effective, what is necessary to exercise responsible security in today's era.\"\n\nTouching briefly on the breach experienced by the Australian government earlier this year, Yoran said it's safe to assume that poor hygiene is at the crux of just about every high profile breach and headline in recent years.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE", "description": "It's not necessarily that they broke into your house; it's that the door was wide open.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/28/93a18820-76b2-11e4-b569-d4ae52e95e57/thumbnail/770x578/62a4d9f552881d7a7ca1f356bce83665/nation-state-spying-malware-revealed-v1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
