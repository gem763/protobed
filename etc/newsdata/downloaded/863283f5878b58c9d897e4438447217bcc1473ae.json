From making my debut in 2006, to Ashes wins, and of course the World Cup final at Lord's, to name just a few.\n\n\"To wear the shirt for so long has been a dream come true.\" #ThankYouSarah \u2764\ufe0f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \u2014 England Cricket (@englandcricket) September 27, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I've also been blessed with travelling the world and making lifelong friends along the way. To be right in the thick of women's cricket as it's gone from strength to strength - not only in England, but across the world - has been an amazing experience, and I can look back on what women's cricket has achieved with great pride at playing some small part in it.\n\n\"The England girls are role models on and off the field, and they have undoubtedly inspired - and will continue to inspire - so many young people to take up the game, girls and boys. I can't wait to see the heights that this team can reach.\n\n\"I am extremely proud of my career. I leave with my head held high and with excitement for what my future holds and what my next chapter brings.\"\n\nTaylor first took a break from cricket in 2016 as part of her management of anxiety.\n\nIn July, she withdrew from the remainder of the Women's Ashes against Australia because of mental health problems, despite admitting she had made \u201cprogress\u201d over the past three years.\n\nClare Connor, the managing director of women's cricket said: \"Sarah can be immensely proud of everything she has achieved in an England shirt, and of everything she has done for the women's game.\n\n\"She is someone that young people can look up to, for her achievements and talent on the pitch \u2013 but also for her bravery and resilience off it. She has come through significant adversity and performed on the world stage for her country.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful to Sarah for her contributions to English cricket over the last 13 years. She has become a powerful voice within women\u2019s sport and I\u2019m sure she will make a success of the next stage of her professional life. We all wish her the very best.\"", "description": "England wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor has made the \u201ctough\u201d decision to retire from international cricket after citing her ongoing battle with anxiety.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.a.ihFg0axSHTsHUNbCgOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4Tje7FslvnpNogpaZ4bJJg--~B/aD05OTU7dz0xNTkxO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/69511978c27c0b0733349e50634c6207", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
