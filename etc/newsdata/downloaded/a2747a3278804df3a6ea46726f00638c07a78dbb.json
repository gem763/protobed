Roughly $1.8 billion will come from military construction projects outside the United States and $1.8 billion will come from projects within the United States and its territories.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Esper told him some of the money will come from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in his home state.\n\n\u201cIt is a slap in the face to the members of the Armed Forces who serve our country that President Trump is willing to cannibalize already allocated military funding to boost his own ego and for a wall he promised Mexico would pay to build,\u201d Schumer wrote in a statement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump declared a national emergency in February, commanding the diversion of $8 billion from various federal accounts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Besides military construction projects, a Treasury Department account and Defense Department efforts to interdict drugs were affected by the presidential order.\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

The Defense Department plans to start calling lawmakers Wednesday to deliver the bad news for districts that will lose out on millions of dollars for military bases and other defense installations at the expense of the president's signature campaign promise of erecting a wall dividing the United States from its southern neighbor.\n\nIt is still unclear how many districts will be affected, and House Democratic leaders do not yet have a list of the canceled projects, according to a senior aide.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who oversees military construction funding in the House, warned that the Trump administration \u201cis about to weaken our national security by stealing billions from our military,\" including training for soldiers and schools for military families.\n\n\u201cI reminded his Admin today that I will not support this theft from our military,\" Wasserman Schultz wrote on Twitter. \"Trump can pander to his nativist base, but the House will fight his every attempt to make our military families or national security suffer as a result.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's list of projects that would be shorted under the national emergency declaration initially had nearly $12.9 billion worth of projects in dozens of states, as well as several locations overseas.\n\nThe move is expected to draw ire, at least privately, from Republicans as well. Lawmakers in both parties have consistently warned the Pentagon against raiding the defense budget for a border wall \u2014 a move they fear will hurt military readiness.", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper called Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday to detail the cash grab.", "authors": ["Jennifer Scholtes", "Sarah Ferris", "John Bresnahan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/d5/6d/4aac54d04c648958dff67c73ea39/20190903-border-wall-new-mexico-gty-773.jpg"}
