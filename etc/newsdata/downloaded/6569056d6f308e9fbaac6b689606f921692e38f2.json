One would be hard-pressed to find a country in Europe, Asia or North America that is exporting products with little difficulty.\n\nIf the United States wishes to export products at a higher clip, we\u2019d require partners with the means to afford our products. Yet the U.S. \u2019s strength alongside foreign tariffs is impeding the process.\n\nUUP Daily Chart\n\nOne might think that the dollar\u2019s strength would be helpful in importing products from other countries. At the moment, however, a wide range of imported goods have been tagged with tariffs that wind up costing end-using consumers a whole lot more money.\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. consumer has been strong and resilient. On the other hand, if we\u2019re not acquiring enough goods from places like the United Kingdom and Germany, it may adversely affect jobs stateside.\n\nManufacturing Recessions UK\n\nConsider the manufacturing recessions that are burgeoning in Europe. (See the charts below.) Readings below 50 represent contraction.\n\nManufacturing Recessions Germany\n\nNotice that I have not even mentioned the elephant in the global room: China. The world\u2019s 2nd largest economy is not just our trading partner, but it is pivotal in nearly everything that transpires across the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe fact that China\u2019s economy is now growing at its slowest pace in 27 years is downright devastating. One might even take notice that the last two times that Chinese fell to these levels \u2014 2000 and 2008 \u2014 the U.S. experience significant economic downturns.\n\nChinese Economic Growth Slows\n\nImportantly, the U.S. manufacturing segment recently like the rest of the world. Some may dismiss the reality because we are a consumer-oriented society. Others may point to the recessionary pressures in U.S. manufacturing from 2013 and 2016, where broader based contraction did not come to pass.\n\nThere are differences, however. Throughout the early 2010s, the U.S. engaged in \u201cemergency\u201d level stimulus with zero percent rate policy and quantitative easing. In a similar vein, nearly every major central bank in the world \u201cdouble-downed\u201d on more quantitative easing stimulus (QE) in 2016. What\u2019s more, in 2016, fiscal stimulus via tax cut promises occurred alongside a Republican sweep of the branches of government.\n\nISM Manufacturing: PMI Composite Index\n\nHere in 2019, Congress is unlikely to authorize any fiscal packages prior to the 2020 election. As for monetary stimulus, dissent at the Federal Reserve would likely restrict voting members to a more subtle rate cutting trajectory. They\u2019d require more evidence of an industry-wide recession that has spread beyond manufacturing before throwing in the towel and kick-starting more QE.\n\nStill, it is clear that the U.S. manufacturing slowdown is adversely impacting the U.S. economy at large. Take a look at the rather dramatic slide in per share estimates in 2019.\n\nS&P 500 EPS Estimates\n\nAn optimist might choose to look at the absolute levels of the S&P 500. A mere 3% off of all-time highs? Surely U.S. stocks would be down much more than that if we were closing in on an industry-wide recession beyond the manufacturing segment. Wouldn\u2019t they?\n\nIt is worth remembering that the S&P 500 was only 5% off of its all-time record at the time that the Great Recession began in December of 2007. It is also worth remembering that the experts in charge of identifying receptions were nearly 12 months late in declaring the Great Recession\u2019s reception. It was not until 12/1/2008 when NBER finally announced that a recession had started roughly one year earlier.\n\nNBER Recession Dating vs Market Realization\n\nIt is fair to say that we may be underestimating the impact of a worldwide slowdown on the U.S. economy and U.S. asset prices. Some will tell you that $17 trillion in negative interest rate bonds are not suggesting that something\u2019s awry. Others will dismiss the fact that every maturity on the U.S. Treasury curve has inverted below the overnight lending rate.\n\nUS Treasury Yield Curve\n\nIs the global bond market truly wrong? Or have U.S. large cap stocks simply stayed late at a party that actually ended more than 19 months ago in January of 2018?\n\nCredit spreads between Treasury bonds and corporate bonds tend to widen significantly before a full-fledged recession. One has come to expect a widening of roughly 500 basis points. The reality that spreads remain tight and that a flight away from corporate bonds has yet to occur is a prominent positive for risk takers.\n\nCredit Spreads\n\nStill, a reversal could happen very quickly. Moreover, the bulk of data, including the resurgence of gold, is hinting at some amount of risk reduction.\n\nFor the bulk of my near-retiree and retiree client base, we still maintain roughly 48%-50% in equity, including assets like Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (NYSE: ), iShares Minimum Volatility Global (NYSE: ), iShares U.S. REIT (NYSE: ) and Vanguard MegaCap (NYSE: ). We also see value in a few individual companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ).\n\nIn the income space, we have a wide variety of preferreds, including Van Eck Preferred EX Financial (NYSE: ) and individual names like STANLEY BLACK & DECKER INC 5.75% PRF 2052 (NYSE: ). We\u2019ve also held on to income mainstays such as iShares Core U.S. Treasury (NYSE: ) as well as iShares Aaa-A Rated Corporate Bond (NYSE: ), as well as cash equivalents like SPDR Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (NYSE: ).\n\nKeep in mind, if we believed that we were early in the credit cycle, we would likely be looking for 65% growth/35% income as well as a much wider array of risk assets. However, the likelihood is that we are very late in the credit cycle. This means we are keenly aware of the potential for things to devolve. We would not hesitate to cut our allocation to stocks and other risks if our outlook called for greater portfolio protection.\n\nDisclosure: Gary Gordon, MS, CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial, Inc., a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC.
