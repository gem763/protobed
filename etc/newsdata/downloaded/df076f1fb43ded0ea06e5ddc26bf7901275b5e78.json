group rejects talks to end fuel protests", "language": "en", "text": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 The indigenous group leading mass protests in Ecuador on Friday rejected an offer of direct talks from President Lenin Moreno to end days of deadly protests against fuel price hikes.\n\n\u201cThe dialogue that he\u2019s seeking lacks credibility,\u201d the indigenous umbrella group CONAIE said in a statement, adding that it would negotiate with the government only when a decree to remove fuel subsidies has been \u201crepealed.\u201d\n\nMoreno earlier Friday proposed the direct talks as the protests stretched into a 10th day.\n\n\u201cIt is essential to stop the violence,\u201d he said in a brief address on television. \u201cI call on the leaders to talk directly with me.\u201d\n\nIn their statement, the indigenous group replied that \u201cthe dialogue that the national government says it promotes\u2026 is based on one of the worst massacres in the history of Ecuador.\u201d\n\nClashes between protesters and security forces have left five dead and more than 2,000 wounded, according to the ombudsman\u2019s office.\n\nIndigenous groups from disadvantaged communities in the Amazon and the Andes have spearheaded demands that Moreno reinstate fuel subsidies that were cut last week \u2014 part of a deal his government struck to obtain a $4.2 billion loan from the IMF.\n\n\u2013 Police, protester clashes \u2013\n\nRiot police clashed with indigenous demonstrators at various areas in Ecuador\u2019s capital again Friday.\n\nDemonstrators responded to volleys of tear gas with homemade mortars and fireworks launched through tubes, turning the area around the Congress building in Quito into a battleground.\n\nAlso arriving in the capital to protest were a thousand Amazon Indians, armed with spears.\n\nRoad blocks were reported in 17 of Ecuador\u2019s 24 provinces, according to authorities.\n\nOn Thursday, indigenous leaders had hardened their stance in the face-off, rejecting UN and Catholic Church-mediated talks, and calling for a \u201cradicalization\u201d of the protests.\n\nThe violence has brought much of the capital to a standstill since Monday and forced Moreno to relocate his government to Ecuador\u2019s second city, Guayaquil.\n\nThe government declared a state of emergency for 60 days and deployed some 75,000 military and police, in addition to imposing a curfew in the vicinity of government buildings.\n\nThe end of the fuel subsidies has meant that prices shot up by as much as 120 percent from October 3.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for us people from the countryside, city people, the rich, couldn\u2019t survive,\u201d said 52-year-old indigenous protester Maria Escobar as she called for the president\u2019s dismissal.\n\nDiego de la Vega, a student who joined the indigenous crowd, said that \u201cwe don\u2019t just protest about gas, but about Moreno\u2019s entire agreement with the IMF, as it affects all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll countries that have signed agreements with the IMF, it didn\u2019t turn out well for them, like Argentina for example,\u201d the 24-year-old said.\n\n\u2013 More protesters \u2013\n\nCONAIE claimed around 20,000 indigenous people arrived in the capital last weekend from Amazon and Andes communities.\n\nEcuador\u2019s indigenous groups make up a quarter of the country\u2019s 17.3 million people.\n\n\u201cHuman rights are being violated here,\u201d Marlon Vargas, a leader of the indigenous communities, said in a video broadcast by CONAIE.\n\nThe protests have hit the country\u2019s oil industry hard, forcing the Energy Ministry to suspend more than two-thirds of its distribution of crude.\n\nProtesters seized three oil facilities in the Amazon earlier this week.\n\n\u2013 US support \u2013\n\nThe United States expressed its support for Moreno\u2019s government Friday.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the difficult decisions that the Government of Ecuador has taken to advance good governance and promote sustainable economic growth,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are aware and monitoring claims of external actor involvement in these demonstrations,\u201d Pompeo said.\n\nStruggling to deal with an economic crisis, Moreno has accused his predecessor and ex-ally Rafael Correa along with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of an \u201cattempted coup d\u2019etat\u201d using indigenous groups.\n\nMaduro, a leftist firebrand whom Washington is seeking to oust, has denounced allegations of involvement as absurd, but praised the \u201cpopular insurrection\u201d against the IMF.", "description": "Quito (AFP) \u2013 The indigenous group leading mass protests in Ecuador on Friday rejected an offer of
