The storm\u2019s glacial pace will result in even more devastation, meteorologists say.\n\nWith sustained winds of 185 mph and gusts up to 220 mph at the time of landfall in the Bahamas, Dorian made its mark as one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record. While it was recategorized as a Category 4 storm late Monday morning, with winds of 155 mph, it remains an extremely dangerous storm, forecasters say. In part, that\u2019s because it\u2019s moving so slowly. Adam Douty, a meteorologist with AccuWeather, says Dorian will move as slowly as 1 or 2 mph \u201cfor the next 12 hours or so.\u201d\n\nFor those in Hurricane Dorian\u2019s path, that\u2019s a big cause for concern. A slow-moving storm \u201cmakes the flooding worse, you have continued battering with the wind so it has time to weaken structures, and once they\u2019re weakened it could damage them further,\u201d Douty says. In addition, Dorian will likely cause significant coastal erosion along the coast with \u201chours and hours of waves\u201d in the Bahamas.\n\n#Dorian has moved maybe 8mi during this 5 hour loop; all the while, it's been battering Grand Bahama and Great Abaco with storm surges >=20', winds gusting up to 200mph, and torrential rainfall. It's no longer a C5, but remains an extreme hurricane as it slowly starts to curve N. pic.twitter.com/3ywkiBpaY6 \u2014 Hank Dolce (@tropicstopics) September 2, 2019\n\nWhat\u2019s slowing Dorian down? Hurricanes are steered by upper-level winds in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Forecasters say Dorian has slowed down because a high pressure ridge that was steering the storm westward has weakened. Now, the storm is essentially waiting for another external force before it starts moving quickly again.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of in a holding pattern. There\u2019s nothing to steer it basically until Tuesday, when it starts to get a nudge,\u201d Lance Wood, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service, tells TIME. \u201cIt\u2019s just stuck, there\u2019s no large-scale wind moving it right now.\u201d\n\nDouty adds that a cold front moving across the Great Lakes could eventually start pulling Dorian northward, but that would not happen until later on Monday at the earliest.\n\nAs of late Monday morning, Hurricane Dorian is expected to approach the Southeastern U.S. late Tuesday into early Wednesday before winding its way up the eastern seaboard. Earlier projections suggested Dorian would make its way more inland and hit Florida over Labor Day weekend.\n\nDespite the downgrade to a Category 4, Hurricane Dorian remains extremely dangerous. As TIME has previously reported, \u201ca Category 4 hurricane will blow out most windows on high-rise buildings, uproot most trees and will likely down many power lines. Power outages can last for weeks or even months after storms of this level. Water shortages are also common in the aftermath of Category 4 hurricanes, potentially making the affected area uninhabitable for weeks or months.\u201d\n\nThe latest forecasted track for Hurricane Dorian as of 11 a.m. ET on Monday, Sept. 2. | NOAA More\n\nThe hurricane\u2019s effects on the Southeastern U.S. are not expected to be \u201canywhere near as dangerous as what the Bahamas has seen,\u201d Douty says. The Bahamas will likely face the worst damage caused by the storm from Sunday morning until Monday afternoon, he adds.", "description": "Dorian packs winds of over 150 miles an hour, but the storm itself is crawling along", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JlYKbSDS_UEMdCIEd_QV1Q--~B/aD0yNDAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/8219551c2ddd80df35e7b4a32e5fa5ce"}
