NBC has insisted that the agreements were standard and not meant to prevent women from discussing sexual harassment, while Farrow reported that they were understood as \u201cpayouts\u201d or \u201csettlements\u201d to keep accusers quiet.\n\nMinna J. Kotkin, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and director of its Employment Law Clinic, called it a \u201cfirst step\u201d but questioned why the employees would have to contact NBC to be released from the agreements.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you would need to notify them,\u201d she said. \u201cEither you\u2019re released or you\u2019re not released. I assume they want to try to do some damage control.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMaddow broke the news of the NBC statement moments before an on-air interview with Farrow, who won a 2018 Pulitzer Prize for his New Yorker stories on sexual misconduct allegations against former film producer Harvey Weinstein. He began working on the story while employed by NBC, but the network passed on it.\n\nAD\n\nNetwork executives have said that decision was made because the reporting didn\u2019t meet journalistic standards. In \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d Farrow offers a different explanation: The company feared sexual misconduct allegations against Lauer might be exposed. The longtime \u201cToday\u201d host was fired after a former NBC News producer filed a complaint with human resources, claiming he raped her. Lauer denies the allegation, characterizing the relationship as consensual.\n\n\u201cCatch and Kill\u201d claims that women who had previously made allegations against Lauer kept quiet because of nondisclosure agreements. Network executives have vehemently denied those allegations, with NBC News President Noah Oppenheim calling the book \u201ca smear\u201d and denying knowledge of past misconduct by Lauer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no evidence of any reports of Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing, no settlements, no \u2018hush money\u2019 \u2014 no way we have found that NBC\u2019s current leadership could have been aware of his misdeeds in the past,\u201d he wrote in a memo to staff.\n\nAD\n\nBut Farrow told Maddow he had spoken to multiple women who \u201cexpressed agony over the fact that they are constrained by these agreements.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that they are ending that and releasing these women is significant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be a model for other companies.\u201d\n\nKotkin said such agreements can be detrimental \u201cfor a lot of reasons.\u201d They obscure the extent of employment problems and sometimes make employees believe they can\u2019t report misconduct, she said. She noted that some states have recently passed legislation barring employers from using nondisclosure agreements to shield discrimination or harassment claims.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs these things remain secret, people think \u2014 they did think until very recently \u2014 that sexual harassment isn\u2019t such a problem anymore,\u201d Kotkin said. \u201cBecause no one\u2019s allowed to talk about it. They mislead the public, they mislead the courts, they mislead employees. They just skew the conversation about discrimination when taken out of the public eye.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "NBC has insisted the agreements were not meant to prevent women from discussing harassment.
