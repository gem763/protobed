Dominic Lorrimer\n\nHarding\u2019s Winton Capital is among the largest and manages about $30 billion of capital for investors, including individual Australians.\n\nHe has faced a career-long battle to convince investors that trend-following is a reliable source of long-term returns.\n\nBut as more capital has embraced the trend-following factor, he\u2019s become increasingly wary of its powers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a physical science yet a lot of scientists who go into markets make that mistake.\" \u2014 David Harding\n\n\u201cThat a lot of people have decided it\u2019s a permanent feature is a negative thing for how exploitable that feature will be. You are not going to make as much money out of it,\u201d he explains from Winton\u2019s small Sydney office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarding joked that the headlines will say that he\u2019s given up on trend-following, but he insists that is not the case.\n\nRather, he says, the firm has diversified into new trading strategies that combine both technical and fundamental features.\n\n\u201cWe made a business decision 18 months ago but we have been going that way for many years,\u201d the 58-year old says.\n\n\u201cWe constantly think about what is our source of competitive advantage and it\u2019s mainly developing trading strategies.\n\n\u201cWe have a high level of understanding of bias and a high level of understanding of statistics, and a deep understanding of bias and statistics.\u201d\n\nShake-out\n\nThe interview came just as the momentum crash occured, when a swift reversal in bond prices that trend-following strategies had latched on to caused a violent shake-out, leading to losses for many strategies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the firm would not comment on the momentum shock, it is understood Winton\u2019s strategies have given back some of their monthly gains, while its other non trend-following strategies have advanced.\n\nThe momentum shock will no doubt resurrect the debate about the role of quantitative investment processes, and the dangers they create for each other.\n\nHarding has built his firm on investing via a quantitative process.\n\nBut he says scientists and mathematicians will continue to misunderstand markets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a physical science yet a lot of scientists who go into markets make that mistake. They believe they can discover things about the market which are sort of like the laws of the universe.\n\n\u201cAnd they trip themselves up because they overdo the parallel with physical reality.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a lot of useful things you can do with statistics and maths when studying financial markets, because there are a lot of numbers in markets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut he says that if someone is trying to explain a large market move as something that has only ever happened once in the lifetime of the universe, it\u2019s not \u201cyour reasoning that\u2019s good. Your model is wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt's good to have a view but it's also good to be aware that you might be wrong.\" \u2014 David Harding\n\nHe remains a steadfast critic of the efficient market hypothesis taught extensively to budding finance professionals. It assumes that all known information is factored into the price of traded securities.\n\n\u201cThe idea of market efficiency is that, in an almost supernatural way, they know everything there is to be known and they perfectly discount the future.\u201d\n\n\u2018Perplexing and somewhat paradoxical\u2019\n\nHarding says he can buy this argument for a security like a 10-year bond, or a stock that pays out a dividend.\n\n\u201cBut what about a Jean-Michel Basquiat artwork? There is no income so it cannot have a fair value. Therefore it cannot be efficient. There is no concept of efficiency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis, however, is a world where trillions of dollars of fixed income assets will never produce income.\n\nAnd billions of dollars is being ascribed to private venture-backed companies with an unclear path to profitability.\n\nThe value of new economy companies, he says, remains \u201cperplexing and somewhat paradoxical\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have to wrestle with that paradox. I am not a creature of the new economy.\u201d\n\nBut he says he\u2019s been wrong on so many things that he should have a high degree of humility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a view but it\u2019s also good to be aware that you might be wrong. There might be things going on that we won\u2019t know about for many years to come.\u201d\n\nWhat he is convinced about is that there is room for firms like Winton to manage ever more assets if they can achieve the returns that justify the fees they charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe big picture is everyone is living longer and the world is getting richer. And many more people are going into pension schemes.\u201d\n\nThe amount of money managed has increased by tens of trillions of dollars, he says.\n\nBut it is also a world where technology is driving deflation. The brokerage on a futures trade from the days when a young Harding first arrived on the futures floor has gone down by 99.5 per cent\n\n\u201cThose are big trends changing the structure of firms \u2013 they are making the big firms bigger and cheaper.\u201d\n\nBut he says there is more room for specialist players and compares hedge funds to luxury brands.\n\nHe knows, however, there will be increased competition and cost pressure. \u201cYou wish your competitors didn\u2019t exist but you know the world would be a worse-off place. Any competition keeps us all honest.\n\n\u201cYou just fight for your levels of fees and if you are not justifying what your investors are paying you, they disinvest and it dies. That is competition.\u201d", "description": "As more capital has embraced the trend-following factor, British hedge fund legend David Harding has become increasingly wary of its powers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4887%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1026%2C$y_457/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/5dd5f228b7da8d7b678e4b4018f8aeb67aa36c0e", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
