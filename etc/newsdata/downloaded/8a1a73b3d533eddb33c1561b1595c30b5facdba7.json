So now, they\u2019re not with me and the difference of their lives,\" the mother-of-five began.\n\n\"They have become Mr Price\u2019s, tried to be famous, end up getting Instagram posts off the back of me, getting all jobs from me and being able to earn money from stories and all that with always mentioning my name.\"\n\nKatie's clip did not sit well with Kris, who took to the comments with a scorching comeback, where he defended himself as a \"respectful gentleman\" who would \"never become a Mr Price\".\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe typed, for her 2.1 million followers to see: \"Don\u2019t test me mate!
