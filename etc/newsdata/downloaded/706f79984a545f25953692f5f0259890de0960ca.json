We first have to think about what kind of circumstances would a European aircraft carrier get used.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to build a few carriers, it\u2019s another to put them under European command. That\u2019s a lot more complicated . . . . We\u2019re not quite there yet, though we\u2019ve made enormous progress.\"\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "All in all, a European carrier will only come about in a world where Germany is willing and able to commit far more resources to defense than it currently does; and can arrive at a joint vision with France on how to use such an expensive vessel to project force abroad.
