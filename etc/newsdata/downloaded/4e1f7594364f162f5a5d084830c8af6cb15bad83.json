Many welcomed the IPO\u2019s decision on Thursday.\n\nLiverpool youngsters shine but James Milner steers them past MK Dons Read more\n\nIn a statement, Liverpool FC said: \u201cThe club accepts the decision that has been taken by the Intellectual Property Office, due primarily to what the official judgement cites as \u2018the geographical significance\u2019 of Liverpool as a city in comparison to place names that have been trademarked by other football clubs in the UK. We will, however, continue to aggressively pursue those large-scale operations which seek to illegally exploit our intellectual property and would urge the relevant authorities to take decisive action against such criminal activity wherever it exists.\u201d\n\nPeter Moore, the club\u2019s chief executive officer, said: \u201cIt should be stressed that our application was put forward in good faith and with the sole aim of protecting and furthering the best interests of the club and its supporters. Nevertheless, we accept the decision and the spirit in which it has been made.\n\n\u201cI would also like to take the opportunity to reiterate our thanks to all those who engaged with us throughout this process, most notably independent traders and local football clubs.\u201d\n\nIn further comments to the Liverpool Echo, Moore said: \u201cWe underestimated the reaction to it. We had, in very good faith, looked at what we were seeing on a global basis and particularly stuff that was coming into the UK. We felt obliged to protect the football club and had looked at other similar situations for clubs that had trademarked their place names in a football context, there are numerous examples.\n\n\u201cWe felt that on behalf of the club we needed to do that - but I think it\u2019s fair to say that we underestimated the emotional reaction to it and that\u2019s our bad. Whilst we continued with the filing, we received the rejection from the IPO and we accept that and move on - we have got plenty of other stuff to do.\u201d\n\nSupporters union Spirit of Shankly described the IPO\u2019s rejection of the trademark application as a \u201cvictory for common sense.\u201d A statement said: \u201cSOS were clear at the outset that the word \u2018Liverpool\u2019 is not for FSG [Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owners] or anybody else to own \u2013 it belongs to the city of Liverpool and its people. We should all be allowed to use it freely, however we see fit, without fear of legal letters dropping through our doors.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\n\u201cLFC have enough legal remedies from their current trademarks to address any issues they may have. Any more is unnecessary.\u201d\n\nA number of Liverpool FC supporters protested against the club\u2019s trademark attempt by wearing non-official items of clothing carrying the club\u2019s name and logo during the recent 3-1 victory over Newcastle United at Anfield.\n\n\u201cWithout fan activism this issue may not have ended like this,\u201d added the Spirit of Shankly statement. \u201cWithout fan involvement there would be no challenge to the corporate greed within football. SOS remain vigilant to the stealth of the club in their relentless pursuit of money at any cost.\u201d", "description": "Liverpool FC\u2019s attempt to trademark the word \u2018Liverpool\u2019 has been rejected by the government\u2019s Intellectual Property Office due to the \u2018geographical significance\u2019 of the city", "authors": ["Sachin Nakrani"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d853f061b3fea12d4b58c0a38661dea5a056ccc9/0_162_5303_3181/master/5303.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ae3f5a5601362df3486d28a0744faff", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
