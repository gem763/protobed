Police later dispersed protesters with pepper spray. Some pro-life demonstrators also celebrated the decision outside the building.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Activists backing the decriminalization of abortion hold a demonstration outside the national assembly building in Quito on Tuesday.

A similar reform was rejected in 2013, after the then president, Rafael Correa, threatened to resign should it pass.\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, the archbishop of Quito urged lawmakers not to amend the law. \u201cGod is the God of life, not the God of death,\u201d he said.\n\nSome in the national assembly proposed tougher sentences for rapists, as opposed to relaxing abortion restrictions.\n\nAbortion is illegal in much of Latin America, though many countries \u2013 including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Panama \u2013 make exceptions in cases of rape.\n\nIt is completely banned in Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.\n\nDespite the defeat, Wilma Andrade, one of the bill\u2019s most vocal supporters in the national assembly, struck a defiant tone on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe debate over abortion for rape was not in vain. Today society knows that in Ecuador, raped women are criminalized,\u201d Andrade, tweeted. \u201c[Now] begins a new phase together with thousands of girls and women that I represent.\u201d", "description": "Pro-choice activists say decision is a death sentence, after illegal abortions resulted in 15.6% of maternal deaths in 2014", "authors": ["Joe Parkin Daniels"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e7bbd7f2cade1ed5d3db6e7fddc17f025cee3a3/0_119_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2180f7c71d174f9ace13a674fbaa028a", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
