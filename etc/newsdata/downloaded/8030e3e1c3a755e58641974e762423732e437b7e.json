Throughout the morning, staff pop down to the entrance of the building for cigarette breaks.\n\nBut, when we approach to speak to them, they pretend to be on the phone or quickly duck back inside the office.\n\nThe building belongs to a company called New Stefal Holding, of which Phyderma is a subsidiary brand.\n\nThe firm has been in business for 11 years and has around 56 employees. Last year, it reported an annual turnover of more than \u20ac30 million.\n\nHQ: French company Phyderma, to which former Royal Engineer Bernard paid \u00a34,903 in little over three years, is based Frances' sunny Cote d'Azur\n\nThe holding company owns all sorts of businesses, but specialises in long-distance selling. Two of these brands, Phyderma and Vital Nature, send mail to the UK.\n\nPhyderma describes itself as a beauty product and food supplement developer.\n\nIts catalogue, sent to Bernard in 2014, includes 'footbath salts with extracts of arnica, seaweed and peppermint', priced at \u00a317.80 for two and a 15-day supply of 'Krill-algic', a food supplement designed to reduce joint stiffness at \u00a319.99.\n\nOne letter reads: \u2018The cheque for \u00a310,500 is ready to be dispatched\u2019\n\nVital Nature's website claims that it has developed 'treatments, cosmetics and food supplements that are formulated with natural active agents and ingredients'.\n\nHowever, these cosmetics firms have a cynical side. Along with their catalogues, they include cleverly worded letters suggesting the recipient has won fantastic prizes worth thousands of pounds.\n\nThey hint that all you need to do to claim the money is fill in your bank details and perhaps make a modest order. In fact, the small print reveals you are only being invited to enter a prize draw \u2014 the money is far from guaranteed.\n\nMulti-millionaire St\u00e9phane Alech , 53, runs both Phyderma and Vital Nature \u2014 along with more than a dozen other brands\n\nOften, these types of firms send letters to as many addresses as they can in the hope some respond. Or they may use so-called sucker lists to share the details of households who have previously responded to these competitions.\n\nMake no mistake, the mail is helping to make one man very rich indeed. Multi-millionaire St\u00e9phane Alech, 53, runs both Phyderma and Vital Nature \u2014 along with more than a dozen other brands.\n\nBorn in Cannes and with a perfumier grandfather, Mr Alech says he has always been interested in fragrance and beauty products.\n\nIn his early career, he worked as an operation manager at the French sports chain Decathlon before joining a sales group in Nice.\n\nIn 2004, he left to launch his own business, selling nutritional supplements and cosmetics to England, Germany and France.\n\nThe company, Agence de Marketing Appliqu\u00e9, was based in Belgium and sent catalogues to UK residents under the brand names Vital Beauty and Swiss Home Shopping \u2014 and later Phyderma and Vital Nature.\n\nOne Vital Beauty letter addressed to Bernard reads: 'The cheque for \u00a310,500 is ready to be dispatched.'\n\nIn 2005, the then UK consumer watchdog, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), launched an investigation into whether the mail was misleading.\n\nThe regulator said the letters 'appeared to notify UK consumers of a major prize win and linked claiming the prize, or receiving it more quickly, to the making of a payment when, in fact, no purchase was necessary'.\n\nIn 2007, Agence de Marketing Appliqu\u00e9 promised to make changes to its letters to clarify how its competitions worked.\n\nBut the OFT continued to receive complaints and referred the issue to its Belgian counterpart, the Directorate-General Enforcement and Mediation.\n\nIn 2011, a judge at a Belgian court ruled that the Vital Beauty and Swiss Home Shopping letters were illegal and put in place an injunction to stop them being sent to residents in France and the UK.\n\nAgence de Marketing Appliqu\u00e9 appealed the decision, but lost. The following year, the firm claimed it had ceased sending letters to the UK and France.\n\nVictim: Veteran Bernard Bannon with wife Rosaleen on their wedding day in May 1941\n\nHowever, Mr Alech has continued to send similar mail under its other brand names, Phyderma and Vital Nature.\n\nOne Phyderma letter received by Bernard reads: 'It is GUARANTEED: the cheque for \u00a3143,572.20 in play will imperatively be released!'\n\nThe letter suggests that, in order to claim the money, the winner must first order an item from the catalogue. If the customer doesn't, someone else who has placed an order will receive the prize, it adds.\n\n\u2018I felt sick when I found out how much he\u2019d lost\u2019\n\nTiny print on a separate order form states no purchase is necessary.\n\nRoyal Mail claims the majority of this type of mail is now blocked from entering the UK after stricter checks were introduced in 2016.\n\nAn industry-wide code of practice was launched after a Mail investigation revealed how conmen were using the Royal Mail's lucrative bulk mail contracts to target the elderly. Since 2016, Royal Mail says it has blocked 4.6 million items of scam mail.\n\nBut, despite improved security, some post is still getting through. One reader told us his mother was still receiving letters from Phyderma in February.\n\nA spokesperson for anti-scam campaign Operation Repeat says: 'We know that Phyderma and Vital Nature were certainly still sending mail to the UK in June when we last received an update.'\n\nEventually, we found someone at the Phyderma office in Mougins who would contact the customer service team on our behalf. But we were informed that Mr Alech was unavailable to meet us in person.\n\nMoney Mail reporter Fiona Parker pictured outside the NSH office in Mougins with some of the firm's misleading letters\n\nMr Alech, who is understood to be a regular at the Royal Mougins Golf Resort \u2014 where membership costs \u20ac30,000 a year \u2014 is a busy man.\n\nAs well as New Stefal Holding, which has 16 subsidiary businesses, he owns a jewellery brand called Misaki Monaco, which is sold in more than 40 countries.\n\nAfter some back and forth, Mr Alech agreed to speak to us via a translator on the telephone. Almost immediately, he promised to stop all shipments to the UK market from this month. He also insisted the letters were not scam mail.\n\nRoyal Mail says it has blocked 4.6m items of scam mail\n\nHe says: 'For many years, we have been trying to have constructive conversations with UK authorities, but we haven't succeeded. They want the messages to be different, but without telling us how they want them to be different.'\n\nWhen asked if he thinks his company is 'moral', he says: 'It's tough, the big debate between morality and the law.\n\nWe don't try to trick our clients in trying to hide anything.' Mr Alech says he has 15 people in his customer service team on hand to help anyone struggling to understand the letters.\n\nHe adds: 'It's true there could be certain exceptional cases that get past our customer service.\n\n'But there are certain clients who can't be bothered to call or write to us for more explanation.'\n\nBernard Bannon's son, Lenny, 73, welcomed the news that the mail would no longer be sent to the UK, but remained sceptical.\n\nBernard Bannon's son, Lenny, 73, welcomed the news that the mail would no longer be sent to the UK, but remained sceptical\n\nThe retired construction worker says: 'I felt sick when I found out how much my dad had lost. I hadn't realised he was in such a bad way because he was so secretive. I hope this is it and the mail doesn't just crop up under a different name.'\n\nLouise Baxter, head of the National Trading Standards Scams Team, says: 'It's encouraging to see evidence of our work to disrupt misleading mail targeted at vulnerable consumers is working and that sources of potential scam mail are being deterred from operating here.'\n\nMarilyn Baldwin OBE, founder of anti-scam charity Think Jessica, says: 'Phyderma, Vitamail and Vital Beauty were sending mail to my mother 16 years ago. I hope Mr Alech keeps to his word and does not send any more across the Channel.'\n\nA Royal Mail spokesperson says: 'We identify scam mail using a range of different methods, but, despite our best efforts, occasionally a small amount may get through our net.\n\n'Customers who want to report a concern can write to Freepost Scam Mail, email scam.mail@royalmail.com or call 0800 011 3466.'\n\nA Phyderma and Vital Nature spokesman confirmed Mr Bannon was a customer, adding: 'We regret not to have been informed earlier about his situation.'\n\nBut the firm refused to hand back any of his money. The spokesman adds: 'Our games are legitimate and regulated in strict compliance with European and English law.\n\n'The full rules of the game always accompany each message, ensuring every customer receives clear and fair information.' He claimed all games that offer prizes above \u20ac10,000 are free with no purchases required.\n\nf.parker@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Dunkirk veteran Bernard Bannon lost \u00a370,000 to ruthless post scammers before he died aged 98.
