The endowment will provide student support through graduate fellowships and undergraduate scholarships. DUC and USask have launched a $5-million fundraising initiative to support the chair and its work.\n\n\u201cDucks Unlimited Canada is a visionary organization that has made outstanding contributions to the conservation and restoration of North America\u2019s wetlands and waterfowl,\u201d said USask Vice-President Research Karen Chad. \u201cThis new research partnership will open up exciting new opportunities for our faculty and student researchers, with a potentially huge impact on our environment.\u201d\n\nKarla Guyn, CEO of Ducks Unlimited Canada and USask alumna (MSc and PhD in biology), is one of Canada\u2019s leading conservation scientists. She is pleased that this chair will further the conservation science needed to address increasing pressures on wetlands and wildlife. This is especially important in the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada, an area marked by shallow wetland pools, which she said is the primary area of concern for waterfowl in North America.\n\n\u201cWe want to see the chair advance new knowledge about wetlands and waterfowl and translate that into action on the ground,\u201d said Guyn. \u201cIt\u2019s this landscape-level focus that will provide solutions to some of today\u2019s most pressing environmental issues including water quality, flood and drought mitigation and climate change.\u201d\n\nGuyn said USask\u2019s location for the chair was selected over other Canadian universities. \u201cIt\u2019s located in the heart of the Prairie Pothole Region, with easy access to the western boreal forest, another critical area for this research,\u201d she said.\n\nBob Clark, research scientist and USask adjunct professor in biology, has devoted his life to waterfowl and wetland conservation.\n\n\u201cAlthough this chair will be focused on Canadian conservation issues, you cannot ignore what is happening in other locations as these birds complete their full annual cycle of migration. Depending on the species, some birds use habitats from Northern Canada and the Arctic all the way into South America,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo me, an investment in an endowed chair is going to be really critical for ensuring there is a training environment in Canada for a whole new generation of young scientists, people who are going to carry this passion forward and ensure the natural environment is safeguarded.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the inspiration for and creation of the chair position, please watch the DUC Endowed Chair video or visit the Ducks Unlimited Canada website.\n\nFor more information, contact:\n\n\n\nJane Caulfield\n\nCommunications and Media Relations Coordinator\n\nUniversity Relations\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\n\n306-966-1587\n\njane.caulfield@usask.ca\n\n\n\nAshley Lewis\n\nSenior Communications Specialist\n\nDucks Unlimited Canada\n\n204-941-3097\n\na_lewis@ducks.ca", "description": "", "authors": ["Ducks Unlimited Canada"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
