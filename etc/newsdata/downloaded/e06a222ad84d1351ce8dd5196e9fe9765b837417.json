(WASH), parent company of The Washington Trust Company, today announced third quarter 2019 net income of $18.8 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to net income of $17.3 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, reported for the second quarter of 2019.\n\n\"Washington Trust's third quarter results once again reflect our continued success at generating a consistent stream of revenues through our diverse business model,\" stated Edward O. Handy III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nSelected highlights for the third quarter of 2019 include:\n\nReturns on average equity and average assets were 15.20% and 1.44%, respectively.\n\nMortgage banking revenues reached an all-time quarterly high and totaled $4.8 million for the third quarter, up by $1.2 million , or 33%, from the preceding quarter.\n\nAs a result of FDIC assessment credits recognized in the third quarter of 2019, which amounted to approximately 4 cents per diluted share, FDIC deposit insurance costs declined by $1.0 million on a linked quarter basis. Excluding the benefit from these credits, net income and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2019 were record quarterly highs for the Corporation.\n\nTotal loans amounted to $3.8 billion , up by $48 million from the preceding quarter. Total loans were up by $222 million , or 6%, from the balance at September 30, 2018 .\n\nTotal deposits amounted to $3.6 billion , up by $82 million from the preceding quarter. Total deposits were up by $172 million , or 5%, from the balance at September 30, 2018 .\n\nIn September, Washington Trust declared a quarterly dividend of 51 cents per share. Year-to-date 2019 dividends declared amounted to $1.49 per share, representing an increase of 20 cents per share, or 16%, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNet Interest Income\n\nNet interest income was $33.0 million for the third quarter of 2019, down by $880 thousand, or 3%, from the second quarter of 2019. The net interest margin was 2.72% for the third quarter, down by 9 basis points from 2.81% reported in the preceding quarter. Prepayment penalty income associated with loan payoffs, which is included in net interest income, was $130 thousand in the third quarter, compared to $37 thousand in the preceding quarter. Excluding the impact of prepayment penalty income associated with loan payoffs from both periods, the net interest margin for the third quarter of 2019 was 2.71%, down by 10 basis points from 2.81% in the preceding quarter.\n\nSignificant linked quarter changes included:\n\nAverage interest-earning assets decreased by $22 million , driven by a $76 million decline in the average balance of the securities portfolio, which was partially offset by increases of $21 million in the average balance of loans and $23 million in the average balance of cash and due from banks. Given limited securities-related reinvestment opportunities, pay-downs received on the securities portfolio are being used to reduce wholesale funding balances. The yield on interest-earning assets for the third quarter was 4.07%, down by 11 basis points from the preceding quarter. The yield was negatively impacted by lower market interest rates.\n\nAverage interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $45 million , including a decrease of $103 million in average wholesale funding balances (wholesale brokered time deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances), partially offset by a $58 million increase in average in-market deposits. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the third quarter was 1.66%, down by 2 basis points from the preceding quarter.\n\nNoninterest Income\n\nNoninterest income totaled $18.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, up by $1.6 million, or 9%, from the second quarter of 2019. Significant linked quarter changes included:\n\nWealth management revenues amounted to $9.2 million for the third quarter of 2019, down by $396 thousand , or 4%, on a linked quarter basis. This consisted of decreases of $128 thousand , or 1%, in asset-based revenues and $268 thousand , or 66%, in transaction-based revenues. The linked quarter decrease in transaction-based revenues was largely due to tax reporting and preparation fees, which are generally concentrated in the first half of the year.\n\n\n\nWealth management assets under administration were $6.1 billion at September 30, 2019, down by $353 million, or 5%, from the balance at June 30 , 2019. The average balance of assets under administration for the third quarter decreased by approximately $13 million , or 0.2%, from the average balance for the preceding quarter. The decline in assets under administration reflected approximately $450 million of client outflows associated with lost client accounts due to the departure of two senior counselors at the end of the preceding quarter. The impact of these lost accounts was a reduction of revenues of approximately $290 thousand during the third quarter and is estimated to be a reduction of $620 thousand during the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nMortgage banking revenues totaled $4.8 million for the third quarter of 2019, up by $1.2 million , or 33%, from the second quarter of 2019. Mortgage loans sold in the secondary market amounted to $185 million for the third quarter of 2019, an increase of $48 million , or 35%, compared to the preceding quarter.\n\nLoan related derivative income was $1.4 million for the third quarter of 2019, up by $661 thousand , or 89% from the preceding quarter, due to higher volume of commercial borrower interest rate swap transactions.\n\nNoninterest Expenses\n\nNoninterest expenses totaled $26.9 million for the third quarter of 2019, down by $1.3 million, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2019.

Excluding the reduction in FDIC deposit insurance costs, noninterest expenses were down by $281 thousand, or 1%, from the preceding quarter. Significant linked quarter changes included:\n\nSalaries and benefits totaled $18.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, down by $104 thousand on a linked quarter basis. Lower wealth management compensation costs associated with the departure of the two senior counselors discussed above were partially offset by increased volume-related compensation costs in our mortgage banking area.\n\nOutsourced services expense for third quarter of 2019 were up by $204 thousand from the preceding quarter, reflecting volume-related increases in third party processing costs.\n\nAdvertising and promotion expenses for third quarter of 2019 decreased by $157 thousand from the second quarter, largely due to timing of promotional activities.\n\nOther noninterest expenses for third quarter of 2019 declined by $249 thousand on a linked quarter basis, reflecting modest decreases in a variety of expense categories.\n\nIncome tax expense totaled $5.2 million for the third quarter of 2019, up by $574 thousand from the preceding quarter. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2019 was 21.8%, compared to 21.3% for the preceding quarter. Based on current federal and applicable state income tax statutes, the Corporation currently expects its 2019 effective tax rate to be 21.5%.\n\nInvestment Securities\n\nThe securities portfolio totaled $887 million at September 30, 2019, down by $82 million from the balance at June 30, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to routine principal pay-downs on mortgage-backed securities and calls of debt securities. Investment securities represented 17% of total assets at September 30, 2019, compared to 19% of total assets at June 30, 2019.\n\nLoans\n\nTotal loans amounted to $3.8 billion at September 30, 2019, up by $48 million from the end of the preceding quarter. Total commercial loans grew by $17 million, with a net increase of $34 million in the commercial real estate portfolio partially offset by a $17 million net decline in the commercial and industrial portfolio. In the third quarter of 2019, commercial loan originations and advances totaled approximately $93 million and were concentrated in the commercial real estate portfolio. The residential real estate loan portfolio increased by $26 million from the end of the second quarter, reflecting increased mortgage origination activity. In the third quarter of 2019, residential mortgage loan originations for portfolio amounted to $105 million. The consumer loan portfolio increased by $4 million from the balance at June 30, 2019.\n\nDeposits and Borrowings\n\nTotal deposits amounted to $3.6 billion at September 30, 2019, up by $82 million, or 2%, from the end of the preceding quarter. Included in total deposits were out-of-market wholesale brokered time deposits, which decreased by $52 million from the balance at June 30, 2019. Excluding wholesale brokered time deposits, total in-market deposits were up by $134 million, reflecting seasonal inflows of various institutional and governmental depositors based on their underlying business cycles.
