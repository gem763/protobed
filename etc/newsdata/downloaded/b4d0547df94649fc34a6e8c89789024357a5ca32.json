Tyres and brakes are consistently the biggest cause\n\nThe South East and London had the highest proportion of reported accidents caused by vehicle defects, while the North East has the lowest over the last 6 years\n\nHis warning comes following research published last week showing that almost half of car owners incorrectly believe that an MOT test would rubber-stamp the safety of their vehicles for 12 months.\n\nBasic car tyre checks Tread depth: The legal limit for the minimum depth of the tread on your tyres is 1.6mm, but performance begins to drop off after falling below 3mm. Tyre condition: Motorists are advised to inspect the tyre for signs of irregular wear or damage such as lumps, bumps or cuts. Air pressure: Check that the vehicle\u2019s pressure is at the right level for the load, using your car owner\u2019s manual or stickers inside the door or fuel flap.\n\nAs well as dodgy brakes, the other five vehicle defects listed in the Government's data are: defective lights or indicators, defective steering or suspension, defective or missing mirrors, overloaded or poorly loaded vehicle or trailer and - the second most common fault - Illegal, defective or under-inflated tyres.\n\nPoor rubber contributed to a total of 3,449 accidents, says DfT statistics.\n\nAnd this high rate of tyre faults causing accidents might not come as much of surprise given that more than one in ten (13 per cent) of motorists claim to have driven with tyres below the legal tread depth.\n\nA survey of 2,000 drivers by Halfords found that almost two thirds didn't know the legal minimum tread depth for tyres.\n\nSome 65 per cent of the panel failed to identify 1.6mm as the minimum tread allowance, and were also unaware that they could receive a fine of \u00a32,500 and three penalty points per tyre if caught by the police.\n\nThe poll found that a quarter (27 per cent) of these drivers hadn't checked their tyre tread at all in the last three months and another 42 per cent didn't know how to check tyre pressure.\n\nExperts warned drivers not to rely on an MOT to guarantee the safety of their vehicle all year round, suggesting they have brakes checked between the annual assessment\n\nRecent studies have been highlighting the range of relatively basic vehicle maintenance skills motorists say they struggle with.\n\nFor instance, a separate survey of 2,011 motorists by breakdown provider Green Flag found that half (51 per cent) of motorists can't change a wheel and over a quarter (28 per cent) don\u2019t know how to check the engine's oil level.\n\nWorryingly, over half (51 per cent) of UK drivers quizzed by the recover firm said they wait more than two months to have their car's faults fixed, while one in seven (14 per cent) saying they will only get issues repaired when it\u2019s urgent.\n\nSafety groups are using Car Care Week - which runs from the 30 September to 6 October - to raise awareness of drivers checking their vehicles for obvious issues.", "description": "DfT figures show that defective brake parts have contributed to 3,894 accidents that resulted in injuries or fatalities between 2013 and 2018 on Britain's roads.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
