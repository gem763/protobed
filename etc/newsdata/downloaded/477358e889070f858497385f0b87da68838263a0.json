The court accepted half of the claim.The accused said that they sold the shares out of curiosity, but the court didn\u2019t accept that defense.On April 6 last year, an employee at Samsung Securities made an inputting error. Instead of sending 2,018 employees of the company 1,000 won in dividends for the shares they held in the company, they were sent 1,000 shares for every share they owned.Samsung Securities warned employees not to sell the shares, but 16 employees sold 5.01 million shares valued at 182 billion won.As a result, the price of Samsung Securities shares fell sharply, with the total trading volume increasing to 13 million shares, 26 times larger than the previous day. Shares closed that day 3.02 percent lower than the previous day.BY PARK EUN-JEE [park.eunjee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
