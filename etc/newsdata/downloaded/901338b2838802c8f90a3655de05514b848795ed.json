Hashing and salting a password string prevents an attacker from being able to read it in plaintext.\n\nThe email sent to customers and a security advisory posted on the Foxit Software website did not mention if passwords were either hashed and salted.\n\nThe software maker said it invalidated all passwords for customers who it believed were impacted by the security breach.\n\nHowever, if the passwords were available in cleartext, then attackers can use them to gain access to users' accounts on other websites if users made the mistake of reusing passwords.\n\nFoxit also didn't date the security incident, and it's currently unknown if the breach occurred this week, last month, or in previous years. If this is an old breach that has only been recently discovered, than hackers might have had a huge head start in abusing the stolen data.\n\nThe company did say, however, that hackers didn't access any financial information. It also said it's working with a forensic firm to investigate further, and that it notified law enforcement and data protection authorities.\n\nFoxit Software should not be confused with Fox-IT, a cyber-security firm with a similar name, which had its own cyber-security incident in December 2017.", "description": "Foxit Software said hackers breached website accounts and stole user information.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/30/2881798c-b10a-4f99-bd55-5410bae94a1f/thumbnail/770x578/2ef2ad7c8533d9b2e423bb06727bd1cf/20190830-162227.jpg"}
