Photos posted by SANA showed several vehicles and a small number of troops.\n\nTal Tamr is a predominantly Assyrian Christian town that was once held by IS before it was retaken by Kurdish-led forces. Many Syrian Christians, who make up about 10 percent of Syria\u2019s pre-war population of 23 million, left for Europe over the past 20 years, with the flight gathering speed since the country\u2019s conflict began in March 2011.\n\nSANA did not say from which area the Syrian army had moved into the town.\n\nDespite widespread criticism from its NATO allies in Europe and the U.S., Turkey has pressed on with its offensive into northern Syria.\n\nTurkish forces appeared set to launch an operation on the town of Manbij farther west on Monday, according to CNN-Turk, which said the forces had reached the city\u2019s edge.", "description": "DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) \u2014 Syria's army deployed near the Turkish border on Monday, hours after Syrian Kurdish forces previously allied with the U.S. said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/14/073f25_turkey-us-syria-37688-people-celebrate-news-syrian-town-tal-abyad-in-turkish-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
