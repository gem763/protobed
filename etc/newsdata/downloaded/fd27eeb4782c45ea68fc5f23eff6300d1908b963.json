(AP) - In a sport where it\u2019s all about going as fast as possible as hard as possible and for as long as possible, first-year Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Wednesday elected instead to take things nice and slow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using it more as a mental day, and sort of walkthrough,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you know, when you look at what we got coming in front of us, with the game obviously this Sunday, and then a short turnaround on the Thursday game, we\u2019re a little banged up right now. So we wanted to give our guys the opportunity to try to get their bodies back a little bit.\u201d\n\nAfter opening the season 2-0, Green Bay faces the dreaded stretch of playing three games in 11 days. After defeating the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, the Packers will take on the Denver Broncos this Sunday, followed by a quick turnaround for a prime-time showdown against the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday night.\n\nThe good news for Green Bay is all three games are at Lambeau Field.\n\n\u201cYou just grind through it,\u201d Aaron Rodgers said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this over the years. You\u2019re always going to have Thursday night games, at least one every season, so you know it\u2019s a tight week. \u2026 We\u2019ve had a number of these at home and done really well over the years, so we gotta take care of business on Sunday and get ready for a short week knowing that there\u2019s a nice little break coming at the end of it.\u201d\n\nLaFleur said he just wants to use the time to make sure the players are healthy and fresh for the 11-day stretch. They need it.\n\nGreen Bay placed hybrid safety/linebacker Raven Greene on injured reserve on Monday after Greene was carted off the field Sunday with a right ankle injury. Safety Darnell Savage was in a walking boot following the game after being kicked in the shin. Savage said Monday the boot was just for precautionary purposes.\n\nThe Packers are still waiting for the returns of inside linebacker Oren Burks (pectoral), wide receiver Darrius Shepherd (hamstring) and cornerback Ka\u2019dar Hollman (neck). All three have not played yet this season. Tight end Jimmy Graham (groin), wide receiver Jake Kumerow (shoulder) and defensive lineman Montravius Adams (shoulder) did not participate in a walkthrough on Wednesday.\n\nAaron Jones, who had a career-high 23 carries in the win over the Vikings, acknowledged on Wednesday he was feeling some aches and pains.\n\n\u201cThe next day, a little bit, I was a little sore,\u201d he said. \u201cBut other than that, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m back ready today, feeling fresh.\u201d\n\nBackfield mate Jamaal Williams said he\u2019s going to use these next several days to watch the veterans and ask them what they do to help their bodies recover.\n\n\u201cReally, you don\u2019t have that much time,\u201d said the third-year running back. \u201cIt\u2019s more mental than it is physical sometimes. You just gotta be able to be a warrior.\u201d\n\nFollowing this tough 11-day stretch, the Packers will travel to Arlington, Texas, to take on the Dallas Cowboys before having consecutive home games against the Lions and Raiders.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it,\u201d LaFleur said, \u201cit\u2019s one week at a time. We can\u2019t look any further than today, and preparing to go out and do the best job that we can and get better today. I see it as one game at a time. I\u2019m not worried about what comes down the road.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In a sport where it's all about going as fast as possible as hard as possible and for as long as possible, first-year Packers coach Matt LaFleur on Wednesday elected instead to take things nice and slow.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/vikings_packers_football_73965_c0-260-3900-2533_s1770x1032.jpg?fb51c541270014286202251c994589b7d53de6c8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
