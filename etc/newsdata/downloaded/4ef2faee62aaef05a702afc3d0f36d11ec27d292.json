For some this runs into thousands of pounds.\u201d\n\nHMRC defines a 'partner' as someone you\u2019re married to, in a civil partnership with or living with as if you were.\n\nIf one family has a sole earner on \u00a360,000 and a non-working parent, they will be required to repay all of their child benefit. That is \u00a32,500 a year for a family with three children.\n\nAnother family with two working parents earning \u00a350,000, adding up to a household income of \u00a3100,000, would not be required to repay any child benefit and will receive the full \u00a32,500 if they have three children.\n\nSome people avoid the complexities of tax reporting by not claiming child benefit.\n\nHowever, this can mean they lose out on national insurance credits towards the state pension, and their son or daughter will not automatically receive a national insurance number as they turn 16, which can mean they won\u2019t pay the right amount of tax until they are able to arrange to get one.\n\nThese problems can be sidestepped, as guidance points out, by first making a child benefit claim, but then choosing not to receive payment of it.\n\nBill Dodwell said: \"This is inherently confusing - and people can still lose out.\n\n\"The Office of Tax Simplification recommends that the Government reviews the administrative arrangements involved to improve the situation - and also looks at the position of those who have lost out since 2013.\"\n\nWhy you shouldn't just opt out - the important advantage of child benefit\n\n(Image: iStockphoto)\n\nBecause 100% of child benefit has to be repaid when an individual has an income of \u00a360,000 or more, many high earners have decided to simply opt out of receiving it. In 2017/18, 516,000 families opted out.\n\nHowever, an advantage of child benefit that should not be ignored is that \u2013 until the child is 12 \u00ad- it qualifies the stay-at-home parent for National Insurance credits which count towards the State Pension entitlement.\n\nHow to keep receiving child benefit while saving your family money\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nOne way to save your family money and the risk of this charge is to pay more into your pension pot.\n\nFor example, if the top earner in a family with three children earned \u00a360,000, they could save \u00a34,500 a year in tax by paying \u00a38,000 into their pension.\n\nThe \u00a32,000 tax relief on top of the \u00a38,000 would take their taxable earnings down to \u00a350,000. Not only would they save \u00a32,500 from the child benefit charge, but they would also take their income below the 40% tax charge.\n\nFor a family with three children, this would result in an extra \u00a310,000 in their pension pot at a cost of just \u00a33,500, with a total of \u00a34,500 saved in tax.\n\nAnother way to save is by opting out - and ticking the right box when you do so.\n\nAnyone earning more than \u00a360,000 can register to claim child benefit, but not actually take the money, so there's no need to fill in a self-assessment form to repay a penny back.\n\nThat's because when you receive the form for the benefit, you have two options.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nYou can either take the money and pay it back as extra income tax, or you can untick a box on the application form for a \"zero rate\" child benefit.\n\nThis means that you'll still be able to claim the credits without actually receiving the cash.\n\n\"Once a parent earns more than \u00a350,000 they start to lose their child benefit, until it\u2019s wiped out at the point when they earn \u00a360,000 or more,\" explained Tom Selby, senior analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This means those earning above this threshold often think they don\u2019t need to bother claiming child benefit at all, but by not doing so they are missing out on crucial National Insurance contributions.\n\n\"As it\u2019s often the mother who is off work with the child, it means they miss out on entitlement to the state pension, further exacerbating the gender pension gap.\n\n\"It\u2019s good the OTS have identified that it\u2019s \u2018unreasonable\u2019 the system works in this way and that individuals can unfairly miss out on vital state pension in later life because they haven\u2019t claimed the benefit.\n\n\"The suggestion people should be able to claim back NI credits if they\u2019ve missed out is common sense and the Government should reform the system to ensure that people understand the implications of not claiming child benefit.\"", "description": "Thousands of people are being hit by child benefit charges every year - but experts say it's time to reform the system", "authors": ["Emma Munbodh", "Image", "Getty Images", "Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20561571.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Young-family-in-their-kitchen.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
