Subscribe here to get the G-File delivered to your inbox on Fridays.\n\nDear Reader (Including all of the Democrats not running for president. Let\u2019s have lunch),\n\nAnd then there were 24.\n\nOf course, you normally don\u2019t say \u201cAnd then there were X\u201d when the number increases. You\u2019re supposed to say it in such situations as when your softball team has been kidnapped by a Moldovan blood-sport ring. You sit in your dank holding cell beneath the streets of Chisinau, watching as your buddies are taken away in ones and twos to fight to the death with tire irons and shovels for the amusement of the Moldovan illuminati until it\u2019s just you and a once-pudgy, urine-soaked accountant who\u2019s become a lean, death-dealing gladiator and has decided the only way to survive is to accept that this is the only life he knows. You hear the outer door open and see burly men drag in the bloodied corpses of both your former first baseman and your centerfielder and dump them in the corner. Then one of them comes to the gate of your cell and says \u201cSi apoi au fost doi\u201d \u2014 Romanian for \u201cAnd then there were two.\u201d A macabre grin appears on the accountant\u2019s face.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnyway, where was I? Oh, right. There are now 24 Democratic presidential contenders, give or take any who may have announced since I emailed this to NRHQ.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the things I find amusing is how each candidate must come up with some unique qualification for why they should be president that sets them off from the others. Some are just platitudinous \u2014 Joe Biden\u2019s experience \u2014 but some are awfully niche:\n\nCory \u201cAlmost Spartacus\u201d Booker says he\u2019s \u201cthe only senator who goes home to a low-income, inner-city community\u201d in Newark.\n\nMichael Bennet says, \u201cI have a tendency to tell the truth to the people I represent in Colorado and I want a chance to do that with the American people.\u201d\n\nKirsten Gillibrand explains that what sets her apart is the fact that \u201cas a young mom, I\u2019m going to fight for other people\u2019s kids as hard as I would fight for my own.\u201d She\u2019s 52, by the way.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper is going for the crucial magical-realism bloc. \u201cI\u2019m running for president because we need dreamers in Washington, but we also need to get things done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt this rate, I think the 30th candidate will say \u201cI\u2019m running for president because I rarely wear underwear, and when I do, it\u2019s usually something unusual.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh, I left out Bill de Blasio, who says that his unique contribution is his bully-fighting superpower. Of course, that\u2019s not his only superpower, he also has the ability to make evidence of his superpowers invisible to the general public. It\u2019s a very niche superpower.\n\nDe Blah-sio\n\nI have a fair amount of confidence that after today, I won\u2019t need to write about Bill de Blasio again, save perhaps in passing, \u00e0 la: \u201cThe overflow from the Biden event was so large, the crowd butted up against the dunk tank, where another 2020 hopeful sat, unable even to persuade the locals to throw the ball at the target. After an hour, he remained dry, save for the heavy coating of sweat drawn from the beating midwestern sun and more than a few of his own tears drawn from anticipation of the political beating to come.\u201d\n\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get locked-in; he could say or do something so spectacularly dumb that I will be compelled to comment \u2014 occupational hazards of the pundit trade and all that \u2014 but that will be a judgement call, not a necessity. As I suggest in my column today, I think he\u2019s a remarkably unserious candidate. Yes, that\u2019s been said in this space about other candidates, one of whom is currently in the Oval Office, but say what you will about Donald Trump, he had a gift for drawing contrasts with other candidates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Before I continue, I love sentences like that. Years ago, a friend of mine came up with a bunch of statements one could say about the GOP that would sound positive to people who wanted to hear something positive and negative to people who wanted to hear something negative. One example he offered: \u201cWith Ted Cruz, the GOP finally has the leadership it deserves.\u201d I\u2019m not a Cruz basher, but I still find that funny. \u201cDonald Trump has a gift for drawing contrasts\u201d makes me chuckle, too.)\n\nThe reason it is very unlikely that de Blasio will replicate the success of Donald Trump in the Democratic primaries is that he cannot offer any contrasts that matter. He isn\u2019t entertaining, he\u2019s tiresome. He isn\u2019t charismatic, he\u2019s unctuous. He talks like the president of a small liberal-arts college, spouting clich\u00e9s plucked from a flier on an assistant professor of Peace Studies\u2019 door. He seems convinced that the glassy expression on the faces of the students and faculty in the audience is awe, not a soul-numbing tedium that is a few desperate heartbeats away from resorting to self-harm just to feel something again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t interesting things about the man. His habit of sleeping late is amusing, even charming. The possibly unfounded rumors that every day is 4/20 at Gracie Mansion are fun. His honeymoon in Castro\u2019s Cuba is so on the nose that Tom Wolfe would have cut it from an updated version of Bonfire of the Vanities (perhaps renamed Bonfire of the Chronic). The fact that he married a lesbian is legitimately fascinating, though I\u2019m not sure how it will play in certain quarters of the left given that converting gay people to heterosexuality is not as popular as it once was.\n\nStork v. Ferris\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the most interesting \u2014 and disturbing \u2014 thing about de Blasio is that he is such a conventional politician. In my column, I argue that he\u2019s a Ferris Bueller \u2014 someone who jumps in front of an existing parade and thinks he\u2019s actually leading it. I\u2019ve used this analogy before, and I have a longtime reader who always emails me \u2014 including this morning \u2014 to say I\u2019m getting my movies confused. He thinks I\u2019m talking about Animal House, specifically this scene with Stork (played by Douglas Clark Francis Kenney, one of the co-founders of National Lampoon):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1v0jB3OswM&feature=youtu.be\n\nBut this is wrong. When Stork takes over the parade, he actually does take it over, leading the entire marching band into a dead-end alley. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, I know Stork, sir. And Bill de Blasio is no Stork. De Blasio is a Bueller because all he does is lip-sync the words to someone else\u2019s song and dances for the crowd.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I mean about what\u2019s disturbing about de Blasio. There is not an original bone in his body. He\u2019s a sponge of woke platitudes, acquired over a lifetime of shared pleasantries with disgruntled left-wing academics, activists, red diaper babies, and rent-control Maoists. The sponge is boring. But what he\u2019s soaking up is more than a little terrifying, because it reveals what\u2019s in the atmosphere around him. After all, the conventional wisdom is that de Blasio is frustrated that the Democratic party has moved leftward toward his worldview, and he\u2019s not getting credit for being there first.\n\nThe very first words of his presidential announcement video \u2014 i.e. the central message of his campaign \u2014 are: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of money in this world, there\u2019s plenty of money in this country, it\u2019s just in the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nLet that sink in, like a clich\u00e9 through the blood-brain barrier in de Blasio\u2019s skull.\n\nBumper-sticker socialism\n\nWhen Proudhon said that \u201cproperty is theft,\u201d he had something of a point. He wasn\u2019t talking about all property, but land specifically in the tradition of Roman law. And if you check the video of history, you could find more than enough evidence to make the case that the land owned by aristocrats and royals was taken from somebody else at some point.\n\nMarxists took the phrase \u201cproperty is theft\u201d \u2014 which Marx himself criticized \u2014 and turned it into \u201ccapitalism is theft.\u201d This incredibly stupid aphorism \u2014 no doubt tattooed between the shoulder blades of some Antifa thug (the irony that it was paid for with the red blood cells of capitalism, money, was probably lost on him) \u2014 is predicated on the Marxist idea of the \u201csurplus value of labor.\u201d This potted notion holds that all of the value in a widget comes from the workers on the widget assembly line. The inventor of the widget, the investor in the inventor\u2019s idea, the managers and engineers who figure out how to make the factory cost effective, and the salesmen who hawk the widgets add no value. So all of the profit from each widget sale is theft from the laborer.\n\nI don\u2019t want to get even deeper in the weeds (\u201cDid someone say \u2018weed\u2019?\u201d \u2014Hizzoner). But among the myriad ways this idea is ridiculous is that the ultimate value of a widget is determined by the price it can fetch on the market. Without a market, it has no real price. And without a price, there is no possibility of profit, or even compensation for labor \u2014 unless the state decides to take resources from someplace and reward unproductive labor. That\u2019s how real socialism works, which is why socialism is theft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich brings me back to de Blasio\u2019s spongey sputum. The idea that there\u2019s \u201cplenty of money\u201d to do the stuff we want and it\u2019s just in the wrong hands is literally the logic of the bank robber. Its pernicious radicalism is stunning on the merits, but it\u2019s all the more gobsmacking that a banal political opportunist sees political opportunity in spouting it. I know I keep quoting Wayne Booth\u2019s definition of rhetoric \u2014 \u201cthe art of probing what men believe they ought to believe.\u201d But the idea that this is something a conventional Democratic pol should say is incredibly disheartening. When Bill Clinton admitted that the government could return the budget surplus to taxpayers, but that this would run the risk of taxpayers spending the money the wrong way, it was considered a modest gaffe. It worked on the same assumption of de Blasio\u2019s \u2014 that \u201cthe money\u201d out there belongs to the government, and what you get to keep is a question left to the politicians. But de Blasio takes it further. Because at least Clinton was talking about money that was already in the treasury. De Blasio seems to think he\u2019s running to be the ringleader in a heist movie.\n\nThat de Blasio is seen not as a radical fringe candidate but a sad sack trying to catch up with the cool crowd is a damning indictment of the Democrats, but also of defenders of the free market for being unable to foster a climate where such statements would be seen as the insipid prattle of an irrelevant stoner.I would be more impressed with de Blasio if he were a Stork, but I find him more worrisome because he\u2019s a Ferris.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine Update: Not much to report this week. The struggle to keep the beasts clean amidst all the rain has been particularly intense. The mud and surging creeks are just too much to resist, particularly for the spaniel. This means going to the hose more often and occasionally the full shampoo job. The main problem here is that there\u2019s a little-known rule in the Human-Canine Compact of 12,000 b.c. (subsequently modified and amended) that if you over-bathe dogs, they will punish you by rolling around in extra awful stuff, like deer poop, dead things, etc. Both Zo\u00eb and Pippa have exercised their rights under this clause this week, and they made no apologies for it. As I think I said last week, I am heartened by the fact that some folks on Twitter are confessing that they are actually on #TeamZo\u00eb. I mean, the dogs don\u2019t care. One of the defining features of doggy goodness is that they don\u2019t care about such things. Still, I sometimes feel bad for Zo\u00eb, who in many ways is a vastly more interesting creature than Pippa. I love them both, but Pippa is a girl of very simple tastes, emotional states, and desires. Zo\u00eb is full of mystery and contemplation But what\u2019s very weird for the Fair Jessica and me is how so many people now think Zo\u00eb is so \u201cchill\u201d and \u201cmellow.\u201d I understand why folks think that, but it\u2019s just funny, because for the first few years Zo\u00eb was easily the most difficult dog we ever had or even knew. It took years of training and mellowing to get to the point where she reliably comes when called and doesn\u2019t get into trouble. I sometimes miss the wild child, until the memories come flooding back in. And then I realize how much better off we are now.\n\nICYMI\n\nLast week\u2019s G-File\n\nA follow-up to my G-File\n\nBill Barr didn\u2019t break the law\n\nMy appearance on the Acton Institute podcast\n\nThis week\u2019s first Remnant, from and about Chicago\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second Remnant with incoming AEI president Robert Doar.\n\nThe latest GLoP Culture podcast\n\nOn Bill de Blasio\u2019s presidential campaign\n\nAnd now, the weird stuff.\n\nDebby\u2019s Monday links\n\nDebby\u2019s Friday links\n\nWow!\n\nConcrete explosion\n\nBest places to find Bigfoot\n\nCool find\n\nKids these days\n\nAwesome\n\nBarr\u2019s bagpipes\n\nAnd I found you, flightless bird\u2026\n\nBlack ball mystery\n\nThe words people look up on Mothers\u2019 Day\n\nDr. Strange and Medieval alchemy\n\nWhat color is a tennis ball?\n\nDoris Day heroics\n\nPenis probe\n\nStress balls being destroyed\n\nEndgame behind the scenes\n\nHow starfish walk\n\nStories from the set of Mad Max 2\n\nAnd from The Mask\n\nFree cats\n\nMisplaced Uranium\n\nGetting your citizenship at McDonald\u2019s\n\nDnieper River from space", "description": "De Blasio seems to think he\u2019s running to be the ringleader in a heist movie, but he\u2019s really a sad sack trying to catch up with the cool crowd.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
