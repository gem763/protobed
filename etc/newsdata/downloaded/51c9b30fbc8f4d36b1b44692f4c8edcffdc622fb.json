In America, we have an abundant food supply. And a lot of people take full advantage\u2014which has led to an obesity rate of 35%. Yet despite being well fed\u2014even overfed\u2014most Americans are undernourished and don\u2019t get nearly the amount of essential nutrients they need to stay healthy and prevent disease.\n\nA nutrient is defined as a substance or compound that provides nourishment to facilitate growth and health.\n\nBroken down further, \u201cessential nutrients\u201d are those that cannot be produced by the body or that the body doesn\u2019t make in sufficient amounts. They must be obtained through diet. There\u2019s a vast array of essential nutrients that the human body needs\u2014everything from macronutrients like carbohydrates, fats and proteins, to micronutrients like specific vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. Even water is considered an essential nutrient.\n\n\u201cNonessential nutrients\u201d are just as important as essential nutrients, but you don\u2019t have to worry as much about them because the body produces them on its own. Examples of nonessential nutrients include cholesterol, certain amino acids, and some vitamins like K and biotin, which are produced by bacteria in your gut. (Vitamin D is also considered nonessential because it is made by your skin from exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays. Even so, this is one nonessential nutrient that most people are deficient in.)\n\nAs you can see, the list of nonessential nutrients is short\u2014while the list of essential nutrients is extensive. This means a healthy diet is a must if you want to give your body an adequate supply of vitamins, minerals, and other compounds to not only stay healthy and strong, but live optimally. However, as mentioned earlier, despite eating plenty of food, most Americans are undernourished and deficient in essential nutrients. There are several reasons why.\n\nWhy Is There an Epidemic of Deficiency?\n\nThe main reason so many Americans have nutritional deficiencies is that the standard American (or Western) diet is devoid of any substantial nutrition. It is high in processed meats and cheeses, packaged junk food, unhealthy fatty or fried food, refined grains, and various forms of sugar like high fructose corn syrup. Most of these food items are high in calories, but low in vitamins and minerals. Eating a lot of them leads to weight gain and nutrient deficiency\u2014which is reflected in this country\u2019s obesity rate.\n\nUnfortunately, though, even people who do eat a very well-balanced, healthy diet (rich in fresh, organic vegetables and fruits, nuts, lean protein, and monounsaturated fats like avocado and olive oil) may not be getting adequate amounts of essential nutrients from their food either. Sadly, modern agriculture practices have left soil so depleted that produce is less nutritious today than it was 100, even 50, years ago.\n\nThis is why supplementation is so important. It fills the nutritional voids that everyone experiences, despite a near-perfect diet.\n\nThe solution seems easy enough\u2026take a multivitamin. But then there\u2019s another problem\u2026\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nThe Recommended Amounts are not the Optimal Amounts\n\nWhen it comes to nutritional supplements, government health agencies set \u201crecommended daily allowances,\u201d or RDAs. These levels, though, are notoriously low and aren\u2019t nearly enough to promote truly excellent health. They\u2019re merely the minimum people need to not develop diseases related to malnutrition, like rickets and scurvy. Moreover, RDAs have not been updated since 1968\u2014when they were initially established!\n\nThere\u2019s a big difference between being in excellent health and being free of disease. The current RDAs may have been effective decades ago, before we really began to see and feel the effects of the standard American diet and the resulting epidemics of diabetes and heart disease. But by today\u2019s standards, the RDAs are simply not high enough for people to reach their healthiest potential.\n\nThis becomes more and more evident when you look at how many nutritional deficiencies exist today. Some of the more common deficiencies are vitamins A, D, K, B6, B12, magnesium, iron, and omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nHow to Make Sure You Get Adequate Essential Nutrients\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad news. There are definitely ways to ensure you get the essential nutrients you need, in the dosages you need.\n\nFirst and foremost, follow a healthy diet that\u2019s high in organic vegetables, fruits, raw nuts and seeds, and get your protein from animals that have been grass fed or pasture raised. Even though food these days is less nutrient dense than it was even 50 years ago, diet still lays the foundation for good health. You can take the most potent supplements in the world, but if you still eat terrible food every day, you will never truly be healthy.\n\nSecond, talk to your doctor about getting tested for the most common nutrient deficiencies. Based on your results, you and your doctor can tailor your supplement program to address your individual needs.\n\nRegardless of your results though, it\u2019s important to remember that a high-quality multivitamin is a good idea for everyone. Look for a brand that provides dosages of essential nutrients that are significantly higher than the paltry RDAs. The active ingredients should also be naturally sourced. Generally speaking, cheaper products use synthetic forms of vitamins instead of the natural and more easily absorbed varieties.\n\nHopefully this information will make shopping for a multivitamin and other supplements a little less overwhelming. There are a lot of options, but a little bit of knowledge beforehand can ensure that your choices are effective and provide the nutrients you need for optimal health.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
