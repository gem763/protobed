REUTERS/Patpicha Tanakasempipat\n\nWith an initial investment of $300 million, the company is now racing to build a factory to export tyres to the United States next year, based in a Thai industrial zone reinvigorated by the trade war.\n\nMultiple visits to China by Thailand\u2019s Board of Investment helped. So did two personal meetings with Thailand\u2019s top economic policymaker, said Ju Xunning, a company manager.\n\n\u201cThis impressed our company, and this is also one of the main reasons for choosing Thailand,\u201d Ju told Reuters. \u201cIt\u2019s apparent that the government values doing business with us.\u201d\n\nWith global economic growth flagging, in part because of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China, competition is growing among Asian countries to win investment from companies moving supply chains to escape higher tariffs.\n\nTax breaks, promises to slash red tape and trade missions are all on the table.\n\n\u201cCompanies have thrown in the towel on the status quo,\u201d said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist for IHS Markit.\n\nVietnam has benefited most from the shifts in terms of the number of companies moving business, according to independent surveys. But other Asian countries are eager to bring in more business as well, including India and Indonesia.\n\n(Graphic: USA-TRADE-CHINA-COMPETITION IMG link: here)\n\n\u2018YOU\u2019RE THE EMPEROR\u2019\n\nThe trade war has breathed new life into Thailand\u2019s Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), where Prinx Chengshan is building its factory. The programme was set up under the former military junta to boost growth that has for years lagged regional peers.\n\nPledged investment for the zone rose nearly four-fold year-on-year to 88 billion baht ($2.9 billion) in the first half of 2019. One of the main drivers was investment from companies trying to escape tariffs.\n\nThailand\u2019s biggest industrial estate developer WHA (WHA.BK), which has nine developments in the area, said Chinese companies account for 43 percent of its land sales, up from less than 3 percent before the trade war.\n\nChinese companies are being catered to carefully, the company\u2019s chief executive, Jareeporn Jarukornsakul, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cI told one company, \u2018This location is very good. You\u2019ll be at the heart of the estate, and everyone else will be your tributaries. The feng shui is perfect, you\u2019re the emperor,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nHong Kong-listed Prinx Chengshan said it had planned on moving tyre production to Malaysia, but wavered after the Malaysian election in early 2018.\n\n\u201cThe government couldn\u2019t fulfil several of the promises made to us and we eventually gave up,\u201d Ju said at his makeshift office near the building site.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s deputy trade and industry minister, Ong Kian Ming, told Reuters that although Prinx Chengshan had gone elsewhere, the country had attracted another Chinese tyre company - Maxtrek Tyres, a subsidiary of Zhaoqing Junhong Corp. Ltd - as well as a paper plant and further Chinese investment.\n\nBoth Thailand and Malaysia have since sweetened their deals.\n\nThailand this month offered a new range of \u201crelocation incentives\u201d - including a five-year 50% corporate tax cut - while Malaysia set up an investment board to encourage relocations.\n\n\u201cIf approvals took three months earlier, now it would take a month,\u201d Ong said. \u201cThe trend we see is that many of these strategic investments are reacting to the U.S.-China conflict.\u201d\n\nForeign direct investment to Malaysia nearly doubled to $12 billion in the first half of 2019, and Ong said he hoped it would accelerate further.\n\nHIGH END, LOW END\n\nThailand and Malaysia are competing for higher-end manufacturers, but their wages price them out of labour-intensive work such as stitching shirts and sneakers that is more likely to go to Bangladesh, Myanmar or Cambodia.\n\nOne Bangladeshi factory owner, Faisal Samad, said new orders from the United States had pushed his export volumes up 20% this year.\n\nVietnam has taken aim at both the low and high ends, with companies citing relatively low wages, a motivated workforce, relatively simple business procedures and proximity to China.\n\nWhen Vietnamese industrial park operator DEEP C Industrial Zones set off to China for investment roadshows this month, it saw 180 people sign up this year compared with just 20 last year, said head of sales Hank Kerstens.\n\nAnother beneficiary has been Taiwan, whose government is trying to lure back Taiwanese firms in China with incentives on tax, land, water and electricity. Officials hope to get $16 billion investment by the end of the year.\n\nA Nomura study of 56 firms relocating production from China between April 2018 and August 2019, when trade war tensions have been highest, showed 26 going to Vietnam, 11 to Taiwan and eight to Thailand.\n\nJust three companies went to India and two to Indonesia - a situation both countries are trying to change.\n\nIndia wants to woo companies such as Apple, Foxconn and Wistron Corp with a charm offensive, according to a source and a government document.\n\nA surprise cut to India\u2019s headline corporate tax rate to 22% from 30% last week could attract smartphone makers, industry executives said. The federal commerce ministry said the cut was meant to draw in investment.\n\nBut businesses also worry about infrastructure and red tape.\n\nOne smartphone company executive, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, compared Vietnam to India, saying: \u201cYou meet one guy (in Vietnam) and he takes care of everything from the government side.\u201d That is not the case in India, he added.\n\nSimilar concerns are hampering Indonesia, where President Joko Widodo this month told cabinet ministers \u201cwe have a problem\u201d as he pointed to the lack of companies moving production to Indonesia to escape trade war tariffs.\n\nHe ordered ministers to identify which regulations were getting in the way of investment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of identifying those regulations, fixing them, and making sure no new ones come up,\u201d said Citi Indonesia chief economist Helmi Arman, who cited \u201cad-hoc regulations\u201d as the main obstacle to attracting trade war-related relocations.\n\nIndonesian ministries did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Thailand, Jareeporn said she was optimistic that the recent surge of investment was just the start.\n\n\u201cWe now have a shot at becoming the region\u2019s number one and overtaking Vietnam in five years,\u201d she said after closing a land deal with another Chinese business.", "description": "When trade war tariffs jolted Chinese tyre-maker Prinx Chengshan into speeding up foreign investment plans, the company wound up in Thailand, thanks to that country's relentless courtship.", "authors": ["Patpicha Tanakasempipat", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434468374&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0KI", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
