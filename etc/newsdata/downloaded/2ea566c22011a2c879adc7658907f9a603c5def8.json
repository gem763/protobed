I\u2019d love to return. At present, that seems inadvisable.\n\nI went there as a reporter, in the early months of 1979, a time of revolution, a time when many Iranians, perhaps most, hoped they might soon be freer than they had been under the shah and more prosperous, too.\n\nMy media colleagues regarded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution, as an avatar of authentic Third World spirituality and social justice. The U.S. ambassador in Tehran, William Sullivan, compared him to Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nI left Iran before summer, and by fall it was clear that Iran\u2019s new rulers were achieving little \u2014 unless forcing women to cover up can be considered an achievement. In an attempt to re-ignite revolutionary fervor, militant young followers of Ayatollah Khomeini seized the American embassy and took American diplomats hostage.\n\nThough a more blatant violation of international law is hard to imagine, an effective response was not forthcoming. Ayatollah Khomeini famously concluded: \u201cAmerica cannot do a damn thing against us.\u201d\n\nConfident of that assessment, the Islamic Republic went on to become the world\u2019s leading sponsor of terrorism, eventually providing \u201cnearly a billion dollars a year\u201d to favored asymmetric combatants, according to the State Department. The regime has been behind terrorist attacks and assassination plots in the Middle East, Europe, Latin America and the United States.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s been building an empire. Hezbollah, essentially its foreign legion, has become the dominant military and political force in Lebanon, even as it works hand-in-glove with international drug cartels.\n\nShia militias, funded and instructed by Tehran, are now ensconced in Iraq and engaged in Syria, where more than a half million Arabs have been killed and millions more left homeless. The clerical regime backs the Houthi rebels in Yemen as well.\n\nHaving grown accustomed to America \u2014 and, it goes without saying, the \u201cinternational community\u201d and the U.N. \u2014 doing not a damn thing, Iran\u2019s rulers were upset and angered when President Trump withdrew from a deal that was giving them billions of dollars in exchange for a vague promise to delay the nuclear weapons program they deny exists.\n\nMr. Trump imposed economic sanctions which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said would be removed only when Iran\u2019s rulers met a list of demands, among them the release of all American hostages, withdrawal of forces under Tehran\u2019s command from Syria, and ending support for the Taliban and the harboring of al Qaeda leaders. Which of these strikes you as unreasonable?\n\nU.S. sanctions have inflicted serious economic pain on a regime that has been unwilling to scale back its international adventures to stem the declining living standard of average Iranians at home.\n\nA few days ago, Iran\u2019s rulers lashed out not just at the U.S. government but also at an American think tank \u2014 namely the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), which I founded shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and where I continue to serve as president.\n\nThey pronounced the FDD guilty of \u201cfabricating and spreading lies, encouraging, providing consultations, lobbying, and launching a smear campaign,\u201d and supporting \u201ceconomic terrorism,\u201d a term they use for sanctions.\n\nThey singled out Mark Dubowitz, FDD\u2019s chief executive officer, and a recognized expert on sanctions policies who has provided research, analysis and advice to the Bush, Obama and Trump administrations.\n\nThe regime declared that the FDD would be sanctioned. Had they left the matter there, we would have inferred it was merely sending a message. But it went further, ominously threatening to utilize its \u201csecurity apparatuses\u201d to \u201cpunish\u201d us.\n\nNote the irony: The FDD has long considered sanctions \u2014 with exemptions for food, medicine and other humanitarian needs \u2014 a means by which the U.S. government can attempt to constrain and contain outlaw regimes without resorting to military force.\n\nIn response, Tehran is threatening to use paramilitary force to silence the FDD and, by implication, any other Americans who dare express the conviction that addressing serious criminal activities requires more than strongly worded letters.\n\nSpeaking of letters, 70 think-tank scholars on the right and on the left, including several former Obama administration officials, have signed one supporting the FDD. \u201cWe are all accustomed to disagreement, and indeed often differ on questions relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran and U.S. policy,\u201d it states. \u201cOn this matter, however, we stand together in condemning attempts to intimidate a non-governmental organization and its staff.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, National Security Adviser John Bolton and Ambassador Nikki Haley also are among those who have spoken out. Mr. Pompeo said in a tweet: \u201cThe U.S. does not take these threats lightly, and will hold the regime and its \u2018apparatuses\u2019 to account.\u201d Mr. Bolton added: \u201cIran will be held accountable for any action taken to harm FDD or that of any American.\u201d\n\nBack in 1979, Iran was a troubled land, but one of enduring beauty and culture, with unusually hospitable people, and rather good food (though, much to my dismay, adult beverages were banned while I was in-country).\n\nToday, Iran is a sorely oppressed nation, ruled by wealthy theocrats determined to make free peoples submit to them. Just last week President Hassan Rouhani, often characterized as a \u201cmoderate,\u201d gave a speech that was translated by MEMRI. He demanded that President Trump \u201clift all the sanctions and bow down before the Iranian people.\u201d\n\nSomeday, inshallah, these men and their asphyxiating revolution will become a terrible but fading memory. Their threats notwithstanding, I hope to live long enough to return to Iran when those better days arrive.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
