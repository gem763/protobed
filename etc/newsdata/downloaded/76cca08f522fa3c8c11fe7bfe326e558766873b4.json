I don\u2019t wish anything bad on you,\u201d he said to the 31-year-old Guyger, before adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug?\u201d\n\nThe judge said he could, and Brandt and Guyger stood up, met in front of the bench and embraced while Guyger cried. Judge Tammy Kemp also hugged Guyger before she was led from the courtroom.\n\nJurors could have sentenced the former officer to up to life in prison or as little as two years, but prosecutors asked them to send her to prison for 28 years, which is how old Botham Jean would have been if he was still alive.\n\nThe 10-year sentence, which will make Guyger eligible for parole after five years, was met with boos and jeers by the crowd outside of the packed courtroom, with one woman saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a slap in the face.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the hearing, Jean\u2019s mother, Allison Jean, criticized the investigation into her son\u2019s death, saying \u201cthe corruption that we saw during this process must stop\u201d and that it\u2019s up to the people of Dallas to bring about change.\n\nShe also criticized Guyger and the police training to shoot to kill.\n\n\u201cIf Amber Guyger was trained not to shoot in the heart, my son would be alive today. He was no threat to her. He had no reason to be a threat to her, because he was in his own apartment,\u201d Allison Jean said.\n\nDallas County District Attorney John Creuzot, a former trial judge, called Brandt Jean\u2019s embrace of Guyger was an \u201can amazing act of healing and forgiveness that is rare in today\u2019s society \u2026 especially for many of our leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf your 18-year-old brother can heal and express healing in that fashion, in his words and in his deeds, I would hope that the greater community, not just Dallas but all of Texas and all of the United States, could gain a message from that,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nDallas\u2018 mayor, Eric Johnson, issued a statement saying he, too, was \u201cdeeply moved\u201d by Brandt Jean\u2019s actions: \u201cI will never, ever forget the incredible examples of love, faith and strength personified by Botham, Brandt and the entire Jean family.\u201d\n\nNeither Mike Mata, who heads the Dallas Police Association, one of Guyger\u2019s lawyers, Toby Shook, immediately responded to requests for comment about the verdict. Guyger\u2019s family was escorted out of the courtroom through a side stairway right after her sentence was handed down.\n\nThe basic facts of the unusual shooting were not in dispute throughout the trial. Guyger, returning from a long shift that September 2018 night, entered Jean\u2019s fourth-floor apartment and shot him. He had been eating a bowl of ice cream before she fired.\n\nGuyger said she parked on the wrong floor and mistook Jean\u2019s apartment for her own, which was directly below his, and mistook him for a burglar. In the frantic 911 call played repeatedly during the trial, Guyger said \u201cI thought it was my apartment\u201d nearly 20 times. Her lawyers argued that the identical physical appearance of the apartment complex from floor to floor frequently led to tenants going to the wrong apartments.\n\nBut prosecutors questioned how Guyger could have missed numerous signs that she was in the wrong place. They also asked why she didn\u2019t call for backup instead of walking into the apartment if she thought she was being burglarized and suggested she was distracted by sexually explicit phone messages she had been exchanging with her police partner, who was also her lover.\n\nThe shooting drew widespread attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white police officers.\n\nOne of the Jean family lawyers hailed the verdict as \u201ca victory for black people in America\u201d after it was handed down Tuesday.\n\nThe jury was largely made up of women and people of color.\n\n\u2022 Associated Press video journalist John Mone and writer Jamie Stengle in Dallas, and writer Jill Bleed in Little Rock, Arkansas, contributed this this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The brother of a man who was killed by a Dallas police officer in his own home has forgiven and hugged her in the courtroom where she was sentenced to 10 years in prison.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jake Bleiberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/02/aptopix_dallas_officer_mistaken_apartment_80697_c0-87-3609-2191_s1770x1032.jpg?11802b7a8402999553788c6f73fd6310c4840c8c"}
