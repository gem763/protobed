In August two people, an Iranian woman and an Iraqi man, drowned on separate attempts to cross to the UK.\n\n\u201cWe know that children should be arriving in trains and not under them; and sat on a ferry not underneath a lorry inside a ferry; and that\u2019s what the kids are wanting. They would rather have a safe way into the UK,\u201d Maddy Allen, the field manger for Help Refugees in northern France tells The Independent.\n\nRefugee Youth Service, a UK-based group which works with unaccompanied child refugees, has recently been in contact with children as young as nine and 10 years old, who have arrived in northern France hoping to get to the UK. These two children, Farzaad and Mateen* are the youngest that the service has worked with. They are just a few years older than Lord Alf Dubs was when he arrived at London Liverpool Street, 80 years ago on the Kindertransport, at the age of six. Lord Dubs has taken a leading role in pushing the government to act over child refugees.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

This was in response to, Kristallnacht, a Nazi-organised pogrom which destroyed Jewish homes, hospitals and schools in November 1938 in Germany and German-occupied territories.\n\nOn 21 November 1938, home secretary Sir Samuel Hoare announced that the UK would take in an unspecified number of unaccompanied Jewish refugee children. Sir Nicholas Winton, often referred to as the British Schindler, helped in the rescue of 669 Czechoslovak children. One of these children was Lord Dubs.\n\nLord Dubs, a little less than 80 years later, would find himself dependent on the goodwill of another home secretary, Theresa May. Lord Dubs proposed creating an amendment to the Immigration Act of 2016, which would provide sanctuary for unaccompanied children seeking refuge in the UK. This is during the period often referred to as the \u201crefugee crisis\u2019\u2019 when the United Nations reported the biggest movement of people since the Second World War.\n\n\u201cTheresa May asked me into her office and asked me to absolve the amendment,\u201d he says. \u201cShe said if these children come, others will follow; and I said we can\u2019t leave these children in terrible conditions, sleeping rough and with no one to protect them, vulnerable to criminality, prostitution, trafficking. We can\u2019t just turn our backs on them.\u201d\n\nLord Dubs says that Alan Kurdi\u2019s death changed the government\u2019s attitude. \u201cTheresa May summoned me back again and said they proposed to accept the amendment.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The photograph of his body, washed up on a Turkish beach, made the front cover of six national British newspapers, led by The Independent. In the aftermath of this, Lord Dubs was given hope for the success of his amendment. \u201cThe immigration minister phoned me up and said, we propose to accept the spirit and the letter of the amendment,\u201d Lord Dubs pauses, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve done any such thing.\u201d\n\nInitially envisaged as bringing in 3,000 child refugees, the Dubs amendment was capped at 350 places. This number increased to 480 in 2017 after the government admitted that due to an \u201cadministrative error\u201d, 130 places had been overlooked.\n\nBeth Gardiner-Smith, CEO of charity Safe Passage, says they were initially hopeful about the Dubs amendment: \u201cI think there was a real sense of optimism that parties from across the political spectrum had come together and been united in this issue\u201d. Safe Passage campaigns for safe and legal routes to the UK for unaccompanied minors. Gardiner-Smith says that after hearing there were fewer places made available than had been initially suggested their mood changed. \u201cThat was the first disappointment.\u201d\n\nIn February 2017, the government announced that it would close the Dubs scheme. Home secretary Amber Rudd stated that it acted as a \u201cpull\u201d factor. Gardiner-Smith rejects this justification. \u201cIf you ask any person working with children on the move nobody would say a child has ever said to them, \u2018The reason why I\u2019m here in Europe is that I\u2019ve heard of this thing called the Dubs scheme.\u2019 There is no evidence for that,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy children make desperately dangerous journeys is that they are leaving a situation that is even more desperate.\u201d\n\nJemal, 17, is one of the estimated few hundred unaccompanied child refugees currently living between Calais and Dunkirk. Originally from Eritrea, he has made the journey of thousands of miles alone. He left home in 2014 at the age of 12. He sits on the kerb of a disused car park in Calais, watching his friends play football. The evening is warm and sunny. He has the wisps of a moustache on his upper lip but the eyes of a child. \u201cI had to give my fingerprints in Italy\u2026 they weren\u2019t nice to me there,\u201d he says. \u201cI have friends in Calais but it\u2019s still sometimes scary,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe police come everyday, they teargas us and beat us. This happened in my first few weeks of being here, just when we were sleeping.\u201d\n\nHe has lived in Calais for eight months, which have been marked by his interactions with the police. \u201cIt\u2019s like Tom and Jerry,\u201d he says.\n\nJemal has hopes for the UK: \u201cI would like to study, perhaps medicine because I like science and I think I\u2019m good at it.\u201d Jemal speaks seven languages, among them English and Arabic. \u201cI learned English along the way,\u201d he says. He shouts in support of his friends playing the intense game of football. \u201cI support Manchester United. Marcus Rashford is my favourite player.\u201d\n\nJemal is here to get to the United Kingdom. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to get to the UK but it\u2019s worth the risk,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here. I want to go to the UK for a better life. I hope that they will treat me better.\u201d Jemal says that he left home because he had to. \u201cEritrea is very beautiful but for people like me, they force you to do military service, and that\u2019s the truth,\u201d he pauses in between the joyous cheers of a friend who has just scored a goal. \u201cI want to be free, not to be a soldier for a lifetime like my father or my brothers,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe police here don\u2019t care, they think we are enemies but we are refugees you know, not criminals.\u201d\n\nThe hostile environment is a concern to Lord Dubs, who is actively campaigning for unaccompanied children in Europe and in particular northern France. \u201cCalais is now like Fort Knox,\u201d he says.\n\nThe UK has contributed significant funds towards border security at Calais. In January 2018 it agreed to pay \u00a344.5m in extra security measures to prevent another refugee camp arising in the area. Freedom of information requests in April 2017 showed that the government had spent \u00a3316m between 2010 to 2016 to deter illegal immigration in Calais and the surrounding region.\n\nOne of the issues around the Dubs amendment is what charities consider to be the relatively small number of places made available for it. In 2018 charity Help Refugees challenged the process the Home Office used to establish the number of places for minors in the Dubs scheme, calling it \u201cseriously defective\u201d. It lost this challenge but the Court of Appeal ruled that reasons given to child refugees in Calais who were rejected for the scheme were \u201cpatently inadequate\u201d, and required the Home Office to provide more detailed reasoning for their rejection.\n\nThere is evidence from freedom of information requests made by Vice that local authorities offered significantly more places, 1,572, rather than the 480 places which were ultimately offered for unaccompanied minors. The first transfer of children under the Dubs amendment began in October 2016 after the closure of the Calais refugee camp. Organisations have told The Independent that they have struggled to get accurate figures about how many of the 480 Dubs places have been filled to date.\n\nWhen asked about how many children had now been transferred under the amendment, the Home Office replied: \u201cOver 220 children were transferred to the UK under section 67 when the Calais camp was cleared in late 2016, however we are not providing a running commentary on numbers.\u201d\n\nStephan Cowan, leader of Hammersmith and Fulham council, says he considered the government\u2019s approach to the Dubs amendment flawed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a failure because the government didn\u2019t even try. Look at what they did at crucial points and it\u2019s clear that rather than implementing the Dubs scheme they tried to scupper it from the start. It\u2019s only through the work of Lord Dubs, Safe Passage, Help Refugees and other campaigners that any children have been saved.\u201d\n\nCowan says that councils such as his would be able to do more if they were given support. \u201cMany councils have joined together to tell the government that if they guarantee to pay the full costs of looking after these desperate children, thousands more can be saved. That\u2019s exactly what great British governments have done in the past and it\u2019s what this government needs to do now.\u201d\n\nMaddy Allen who works on the ground in northern France with Help Refugees agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t frame that as a success because it\u2019s been a massive failing that we can\u2019t even transfer 480 children,\u201d she says.\n\nGreece, Italy and France were designated as the three countries where minors could be eligible for the amendment. Conditions for unaccompanied minors are under scrutiny in Greece after news that in Moria refugee camp, on the Greek island of Lesvos, one child was killed during a fight with another unaccompanied child in a designated \u201csafe zone\u201d. Charities alleged that conditions in the camp have lead to this death.\n\n\u201cThe safe zones, as well as all other sections, are severely overcrowded. Provision of services is scarce and inefficient. Incidents go unattended and create more tension. The staff and organisations can\u2019t cope with the numbers,\u201d Better Days, a charity which works on Lesvos, said in a statement. Moria has a population of more than 10,000, which is 10 times over its official capacity.\n\nIn Italy, Marta Welander, executive director of Refugee Rights Europe, told The Independent that conditions are little better. \u201cPoor reception conditions and frustration with lengthy procedures, resulting from the large volume of asylum applications received, mean many unaccompanied minors attempt to cross the border into France to either claim asylum there or to continue on to another European country such as the UK where they may have relatives or other support networks.\u201d\n\nItalian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, notorious for his uncompromising stance towards migrants and asylum seekers, reluctantly agreed to let 27 migrant teenagers disembark from a rescue ship on to the island of Lampedusa in August. He said this was in spite of it being \u201cdivergent to my orientation\u201d.\n\nAfter making the journey through countries such as Greece and Italy, many unaccompanied minors arrive in northern France with their sights set on the UK. \u201cI don\u2019t really sleep at night because I\u2019m trying to get to the UK,\u201d says Mazar, 17, from Iraqi Kurdistan. He has a large smile and is tall and long-limbed. \u201cI still have family in Kurdistan,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I had to leave because I had a problem.\u201d Mazar says that he will not give up trying to get to the UK. \u201cI hope I can study to become a mechanic when I get there.\u201d\n\nHe has heard this week that the large disused gym in Dunkirk where he is living with 900 others, of which 130 are unaccompanied minors, will be closed. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to close the gym,\u201d he says quietly, looking at his temporary home.\n\nGardiner-Smith says legal routes to the UK are essential for the welfare of unaccompanied children seeking asylum. \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to see children risking their lives, whether it\u2019s in the Mediterranean, or in Libya, or in the Channel itself we need to be offering safe and legal routes. We are a country that has managed great things internationally and diplomatically and the fact that we\u2019ve still seen so few children come through this scheme is depressing and disappointing.\u201d\n\nAazar, 17, from Afghanistan, says that living in northern France is difficult. \u201cI\u2019ve been here for two months and life is not good,\u201d he says in nearly fluent English. \u201cThe reason I want to go to the UK is that it\u2019s better for children. It\u2019s not good in France, they will put you in a camp.\u201d He says his family is still in Afghanistan but he made the long journey alone. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous there, I saw a policeman killed in front of me, there are bomb blasts everyday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love biology, I will try to be a doctor,\u201d he says. \u201cI will try the trucks; it\u2019s scary and dangerous.\u201d\n\nAzar enjoys cricket. \u201cI like cricket a lot. I support the English cricket team.\u201d He has cousins in the UK but he knows of no other way to get there other than the dangerous methods he\u2019s been trying. \u201cThere are no legal ways possible for me I don\u2019t think,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if there were it would be great.\u201d\n\nLike all the other minors who spoke to The Independent for this article, Aazar also says that he won\u2019t give up trying to get to the UK.\n\nMagid Magid, the Green MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber who came to the UK as a child refugee himself, says that he thought more children should have been taken under the Dubs amendment. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of admiration for Alf Dubs and I had the privilege to spend some time with him. He\u2019s someone who has dedicated his life to this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we keep forgetting unaccompanied minors aren\u2019t just statistics. It\u2019s just really difficult; and we\u2019ve all got a role and responsibility in it.\u201d he says. \u201cIn comparison to other countries, say Germany, we\u2019re quite awful in accommodating people,\u201d he says. \u201cOur happiness and relative safety doesn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of equality and opportunity for everyone else.\u201d\n\nMagid suggests that there are elements of racism at play. \u201cGod forbid it was Australian, American or white European children. They would not be in the same situation that these black and brown children are in at the moment. The people of Britain are full of love and compassion and are really able to, and want to, welcome these child refugees in.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why it had not yet filled all the spaces for Dubs, a Home Office spokesperson replied that: \u201cThe UK has made a significant contribution to protecting vulnerable children, providing protection to more than 39,500 children since the start of 2010. In 2018, the UK received the third highest number of asylum claims from unaccompanied children in the EU. We remain fully committed to relocating 480 children under section 67 and are continuing to make progress to achieve that objective.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office stated that in the year ending June 2019, the UK received 3,496 asylum claims from unaccompanied children, a similar number to that received in Germany.\n\nAs well as the lack of legal and safe routes, one of the issues raised by campaigners is the inadequate process to report missing migrant children. \u201cGovernment-imposed restrictions prevent the European hotline for missing children in France from taking on cases of missing migrant children. This is morally unacceptable. In other countries such as Greece, the hotline operates as intended and treats all missing children cases, migrant or not,\u201d says Aagje Leven, secretary general of Missing Children Europe.\n\nBrexit is another issue. \u201cBrexit has sucked the life out of politics,\u201d says Lord Dubs, who admits it\u2019s difficult to lobby for changes among such political turmoil. \u201cPeople say why don\u2019t Muslim countries do something? Well there\u2019s a million in Turkey, four million in Lebanon. I make that five to six million\u2026 we are arguing about a handful,\u201d he says.\n\nAlan Kurdi drowned on the journey from Bodrum to Kos, a distance of 2.5 miles. The Channel is 20.7 miles at its shortest distance between the UK and France and at least 80 children have crossed the channel in boats this year.\n\nThere is light, however, for some who have made it over on the Dubs scheme. Mohamed, 17, was previously living in a refugee camp in Greece. He is currently being cared for by a local authority in the West Midlands.\n\n\u201cI was so happy when I found out I could come to the UK, because it meant I could have a good life,\u201d he says. \u201cMy eyes were really damaged because I have diabetes and I lost sight in one eye. I had to wear dark glasses. But here the doctors gave me special contact lenses, which cover the damage. Now I feel much better and my diabetes is under more control.\u201d\n\nStella Creasy, Labour MP for Walthamstow and a vocal supporter of the Dubs amendment, says the government had failed to live up to its word on the issue. \u201cThere are children living in squalid conditions on our doorstep because this country made a promise and failed to honour it. Three years ago we said we would help 3,000 of the child refugees in Europe through the Dubs amendment, and only 220 have been able to come here to safety.\n\nMany more are still sleeping rough and at risk of violence or exploitation, with some as young as nine, all alone and frightened. \u201cWithout providing a safe and legal route for these children to travel it\u2019s likely many will risk their lives trying to cross the Channel or be lost to the traffickers. The Home Office wants us to give up on these children and pretend they don\u2019t exist. If we let them, all of us should hang our heads in shame.\u201d\n\nLord Dubs says that the Kindertransport set an important precedent about how the UK deals with unaccompanied refugee children. \u201cI don\u2019t think I would have survived the Holocaust,\u201d he says. \u201cOne thing about Kindertransport was that Britain was the only country that took them. America said no and Europe shut its doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still believe whatever the attitudes to migrants as a whole, people in Britain are sympathetic to child refugees, providing one explains the situation; and I think politically we can take more and I argue we should take our share, not take them all \u2013 we can\u2019t \u2013 but our share.\u201d\n\nLord Dubs says that he will keep putting pressure on the government to do more for child refugees. \u201cWe think the government has not delivered on its words; and I think they\u2019ve abdicated their responsibilities.\u201d\n\n* All names have been changed to protect the identities of the minors", "description": "On 2 September 2015, a three-year-old Syrian child, Alan Kurdi, drowned in the Mediterranean while his family was\u00a0attempting to cross the short distance from Turkey to the Greek island of Kos.\u00a0\u200bAlan\u2019s death sparked an international debate about how to deal with refugees and migrants making their way across\u00a0Europe, many via dangerous means.", "authors": ["Katy Fallon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/29/13/Calais-refugees-8.jpg"}
