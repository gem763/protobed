While the cryptocurrency is up 100% on the year, it is down some 45% from the year-to-date high of $14,000.\n\nThis dramatic drawdown from $14,000 to as low as $7,700 has led many optimists to claim that Bitcoin will soon restart its surge to fresh all-time highs. Yet, a prominent cryptocurrency skeptic claims that BTC\u2019s chart is \u201clook[ing] horrible,\u201d citing technical analysis indicators. Ouch.\n\nBitcoin Price Chart \u201cHorrible\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019ve followed cryptocurrency on Twitter at all over the past few years, you\u2019ve likely noticed the cynics, the haters of Bitcoin and its ilk.\n\nOne of the most prominent members of these groups is Peter Schiff, a prominent libertarian economist and investor whose father vehemently taxation. While some may see him as an archetypal cryptocurrency holder and lover of decentralized digital money, he isn\u2019t. In fact, Schiff owns less than one coin \u2014 which was obtained through donations and gifts \u2014 and has long bashed Bitcoin, calling it something with little inherent value and purpose over gold.\n\nThe libertarian continued to tout this line on Friday night, when he took to Twitter remarking that Bitcoin\u2019s price chart \u201clooks horrible.\u201d He remarked that the \u201c(bear) flag that followed the recent breakdown projects a move to $6,000,\u201d which would imply a 25% drop from current levels if this move pans out.\n\nThe Bitcoin chart looks horrible. Not only does the flag that followed the recent breakdown project a move to $6K, but we are close to completing the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top, with a $14K head, and neck line just below $8K, that projects a collapse to below $2K! \u2014 Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 19, 2019\n\nThat\u2019s far from the end of it. He continued that not only did Bitcoin fall out of a flag, \u201cbut we are [also] close to completing the right shoulder of a head and shoulders top \u2026 that projects a collapse below $2,000.\u201d\n\nOf course, Bitcoin bulls haven\u2019t taken kindly to Schiff\u2019s latest analysis. Anthony Pompliano, a former Facebook team member that has since become a cryptocurrency investor and tacit industry spokesperson, accentuated in rebuttal to the critic Bitcoin\u2019s scarcity, relative lack of penetration, amongst other facets of the cryptocurrency that may see it appreciate in the years to come.\n\nOnly ~ 1% of the world's population (~ 70M) owns Bitcoin, a more scare asset than Gold. You understand supply and demand economics \ud83d\ude09 \u2014 Pomp \ud83c\udf2a (@APompliano) October 19, 2019\n\nYet, Schiff stuck to his guns. In response to Pompliano\u2019s assertion that Bitcoin is the best-performing asset of the past decade, he wrote that \u201cWhat goes up, must come down. You\u2019re looking in the rearview mirror at what already happened\u2026 Bitcoin went up because everyone already bought. It\u2019s a crowded trade. As the crowd sells the price will collapse.\u201d\n\nLong-Term Bull Trend\n\nSchiff\u2019s technical analysis may be showing that it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin sinks to fresh lows, but for now, indicators suggest that the cryptocurrency market is in a macro bull trend.\n\nThe three-day Bitcoin chart on Bitstamp printed a \u201cgolden cross\u201d back in early-August. What\u2019s notable about this is the last time this technical event played out was early-2016, February 2016. What followed this last golden cross was the rally from $500 to $20,000 \u2014 a jaw-dropping 4,000% move \u2014 in under 24 months, of course. Should history repeat from here, Bitcoin could reach $400,000 by mid-2021.\n\nAlso, the one-month Ichimoku Cloud has seen its first lead line has crossed above its second, flipping green for the first time in months.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "It isn't a secret that Bitcoin (BTC) hasn't been doing too well as of late.
