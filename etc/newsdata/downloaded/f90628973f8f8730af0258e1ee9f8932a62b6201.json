She later admitted that it wasn\u2019t \u201ctotally\u201d random, as she\u2019s been outspoken against the president since 2012.\n\n\u201cJohn is boring and I do have a filthy mouth,\u201d she acknowledged. \u201cBut when the card lands on you that day it\u2019s just really like, \u2018Ugh, crap,\u2019 because your whole night\u2019s ruined.\n\n\u201cIt was a weird feeling,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was really angry. I think my eyes filled up with water just at the shock of it, that I can\u2019t believe this really happened right now. He just goes on these rants, and usually, it\u2019s very late at night for him, you just wait for him to say something, but you don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be you.\u201d\n\nMs. Teigen said she\u2019s now able to laugh about the situation, especially since her profane clapback became a top trending hashtag.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
