All deliberate say the crown. That was when the white girl reference was allegedly made.\"\n\nMr Tanney added: \"It's no trifling complaint that one has misbehaved on an aeroplane at 3,000ft to the extent that a restraining kit has been made ready.\"\n\nMr Tanney said Nelson's claims that he never used \"racist language\" were a \"conspiracy theory\".\n\nLauren Sales, defending, said: \"Mr Nelson accepts he was tired, petulant, churlish.\n\n\"He said, 'He didn't want that one serving him, he wanted another one' - maybe words that you and I might not use to speak to cabin crew, but certainly not racist.\n\n\"The prosecution put it to Mr Nelson, 'oh, you were drunk - that's why you acted in this way,' but we know not a single one of the prosecution witnesses said Mr Nelson was slurring. They did say he had the boozy breath.\n\n\"It wasn't white one, it was as Mr Nelson explained, he only wanted to be served by 'her'.\"\n\nNelson denies one count of racially aggravated abuse on the flight on June 2 last year.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "A business class passenger allegedly racially abused a stewardess on board a British Airways flight, demanding that he be served by a \"white girl,\" a court has heard.
