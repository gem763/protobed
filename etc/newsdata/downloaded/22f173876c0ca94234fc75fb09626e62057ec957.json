In Seoul, all city government vehicles are grounded and officials are not allowed to drive to work. The parking lots of 434 city-run organizations will be closed temporarily.\n\nViolators of the ban will be fined W100,000 (US$1=W1,116).\n\nChang Im-seok at the National Institute of Environmental Research said, \"Usually fine dust density starts to get worse in January and peak in March when sandstorms blow in\" from China and Mongolia.\n\nThe smog gets worse with unusually warm weather. When emergency measures were announced on Jan. 15 last year, the morning temperature was 3.9 degrees Celsius in Seoul, 9.8 degrees above average.\n\nBan Ki-sung at meteorological information provider Kweather said, \"If temperatures are warm in winter, we can be almost 100 percent sure they come with high levels of fine dust.\"", "description": "Fine Dust Pollution at Dangerous Levels", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/01/14/2019011401069_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-14"}
