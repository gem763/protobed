Apple removed the app a few days ago, then reinstated it, then pulled it again on Wednesday, a day after People\u2019s Daily, China\u2019s state-run news platform published a piece that proposed Apple was complicit in \u201cillegal acts\u201d by helping the protestors \u201cengage in more violence.\u201d\n\nReuters reports that Cook defended the decision in a statement posted on an internal company site. \u201cIt is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different,\u201d Cook wrote, according to Reuters, which reviewed the letter.\n\nApple Sells Out Pro-Democracy Protesters In Hong Kong To Appease Chinese Government Apple removed a smartphone app used by pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong Thursday in the tech giant\u2019s latest capitulation to China\u2019s authoritarian government. The app, HKmap.live, allowed users to see Hong Kong police movements via crowdsourced information as cops in the region continue to brutalise the local population. Apple had previously banned the app, but reinstated it just a few days ago, only to remove it again on Thursday. Read more\n\nThe letter (a copy that tech veteran John Gruber claims is authentic has been posted by here) went on to explain that the company reviewed \u201ccredible information\u201d from \u201cusers\u201d and \u201cHong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau\u201d and subsequently determined HKmap.live was used \u201cmaliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law,\u201d Cook wrote. \u201cSimilarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.\u201d\n\nApple confirmed to Reuters that the letter was written by Cook. The company did not immediately respond to a Gizmodo request for further confirmation or comment.\n\n\u201cNational and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts,\u201d Cook wrote. \u201cIn this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\u201d\n\nCook\u2019s claims are difficult to confirm but Pinboard founder and social critic Maciej Ceg\u0142owski has been on the ground in Hong Kong for some time, and they found the Apple CEO\u2019s remarks to be suspect. Ceglowski full statement on the matter is available over at Daring Fireball and reads in part:\n\nThe first allegation is that \u201cthe app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence\u201d. This makes no sense at all. The app does not show the locations of individual officers at all. It shows general concentrations of police units, with a significant lag. As the developer and @charlesmok, a Hong Kong legislator, have pointed out, the app aggregates reports from Telegram, Facebook and other sources. It beggars belief that a campaign to target individual officers would use a world-readable crowdsourcing format like this. Moreover, what are these incidents where protesters have targeted individual police for a premeditated attack? Can Mr. Cook point to a single example? Can anyone?\n\nU.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has been contributing heavily to the debate in a tweet on Tuesday. \u201cApple assured me last week that their initial decision to ban this app was a mistake,\u201d Hawley wrote. \u201cLooks like the Chinese censors have had a word with them since. Who is really running Apple? Tim Cook or Beijing?\u201d", "description": "Apple CEO Tim Cook has explained why his company decided to succumb to China\u2019s pressure and remove an app that was being used by Honk Kong pro-democracy protestors....", "authors": ["Matt Novak", "Sarah Basford"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/avhngw8tri8yy7ro6zrc.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
