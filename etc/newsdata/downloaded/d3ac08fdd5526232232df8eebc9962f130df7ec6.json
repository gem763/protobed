(Photo: Warner Bros.)\n\nThe problem with making a sequel to The Shining is, which version of The Shining are you talking about?\n\nThe upcoming movie Doctor Sleep is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen King. And, of course, King\u2019s novel continues the story of his original version of The Shining, a version that burns down the Overlook Hotel at the end. In Stanley Kubrick\u2019s film adaptation, though, the Overlook\u2014which is one of the most iconic things about that movie\u2014remains standing.\n\nThis posed a problem for director Mike Flanagan. More people know Kubrick\u2019s version of The Shining than King\u2019s and King famously doesn\u2019t really like Kubrick\u2019s version. So, to make a Doctor Sleep movie that pleased everyone, Flanagan would have to go to the man himself.\n\n\u201cWhen I first read [Doctor Sleep], I loved what [King] did with Dan [Torrence, played by Ewan McGregor] and I loved kind of revisiting that universe, but I just had this real ache to go back to Overlook. It was really kind of fun and the book didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Flanagan told /Film and other journalists on the set of his film last year.\n\n\u201cAnd so for us it was a question of how do we try to combine those two worlds in a way that\u2019s going to make Stephen feel really satisfied with what we did and also honour the legacy of the Kubrick film and what it means to cinephiles, one of the most influential, the most influential horror movie of all time. It seemed like such a wasted opportunity to revisit Dan Torrence and not revisit the Overlook Hotel.\u201d\n\nThe plan then was to be as faithful to King\u2019s book as possible, in terms of the story of Dan Torrence and his connections back to that mystical, but also to make sure the character went back to the Overlook Hotel, so audiences could go back too.\n\n\u201cOur job is to thread the needle and take the best DNA for both of them and hopefully bring that to the audience today in a fun, engaging way,\u201d producer Trevor Macy said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to, you know, take custody of one party versus another in the Kubrick divorce. Because there\u2019s a lot of stuff that\u2019s absolutely, you know, Stephen King has opinions about the quality of the adaptation. But it\u2019s impossible to argue that the Kubrick film is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe only way Flanagan and his team would move forward with this Kubrick/King mashup, though, was if King himself was ok with putting the Overlook Hotel from Kubrick\u2019s movie into his story. Thankfully, he said yes.\n\n\u201cWe needed to get Stephen on board,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cBut when we explained how we wanted to do it, he actually was really enthusiastic about it, which was very, quite a pleasant surprise. So if he had not wanted to do that, I don\u2019t think we would\u2026We wouldn\u2019t be here. We wouldn\u2019t have done it really.\u201d\n\nFor more from the set of Doctor Sleep check out the reports on Slashfilm, Nerdist, and other sites.
