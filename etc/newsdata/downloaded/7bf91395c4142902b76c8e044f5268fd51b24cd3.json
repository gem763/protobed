He was 52.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred announced Cooper's death Sunday.\n\nCooper died after having a blood clot.

Popular with his fellow umps, he was talking to them Saturday about his recovery.\n\nCooper made his debut in the majors in 1996 as a minor league fill-in and joined the big league staff in 1999.\n\nHis most recent assignment came in the playoffs this month when he worked the New York Yankees' sweep of Minnesota in the ALDS. He was at second base on Oct. 7 for the clinching Game 3 at Target Field.\n\nCooper worked the 2014 World Series between the Kansas City Royals and San Francisco Giants.

Cooper worked the plate in the final game in the career of Cal Ripken Jr.\n\n\"This is a very sad day across Major League Baseball,\" Manfred said in a statement. \"Eric Cooper was a highly respected umpire, a hard worker on the field and a popular member of our staff. He also served as a key voice of the MLB Umpires Association on important issues in our game.\"\n\nIn a statement, players' union chief Tony Clark said: \"Eric Cooper's friendly and familiar presence in the baseball community will be missed by all of us. He was a professional and gentleman whose passion for our game, the players and his fellow umpires was evident in the way he went about his work and life.\"\n\nCooper was an Iowa native and Iowa State graduate. He was known for rooting for another school \u2014 Notre Dame, and frequently wore Fighting Irish gear in the umpires' locker rooms while talking about the football team's success.", "description": "Eric Cooper, the Major League Baseball umpire who worked the AL Division Series two weeks ago, has died.
