There is this uncertainty. It\u2019s very hard to predict,\u201d Fillion, BNP Paribas U.S. CEO, said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade.\n\n\u201cIn spending a lot of time with CEOs daily, weekly their level of confidence remains very strong on the day to day. They are very active, very committed. It\u2019s a good business dynamic,\u201d explained Fillion. \u201cWhere I see some hesitation is when we start speaking about the medium term. I believe it\u2019s being driven by more outside factors \u2014 uncertainty linked to geopolitical factors and social tensions.\u201d\n\nEverywhere one looks at the moment, the yawning effects of the Trump administration\u2019s trade war on China are becoming apparent. Whether investors want to believe that\u2019s the case or not is a separate issue. But there is no denying the U.S. economy has geared down just as the heat around the trade war has turned up.\n\nFor instance, the U.S. added 130,000 jobs in the month of August. Wall Street expected 160,000, with some estimating a gain closer to 200,000. Downward revisions to the prior two months of jobs data were received.\n\nRetail employment declined 11,000. Manufacturing employment continued to be under pressure amid weakening business out of China.\n\nPrivate employment rose a modest 96,000.\n\n\u201cThe momentum is clearly slowing,\u201d Renaissance Macro strategist Neil Dutta said.\n\nThe ho-hum jobs report comes on the heels of plunging consumer confidence figures, further weakness in manufacturing purchasing manager indexes in the U.S. and tempered outlooks on capital expenditure spending by CEOs. This week alone brought a material sales warning from global economic bellwether JetBlue (JBLU).\n\nThe saving grace in the minds of some on Wall Street? August\u2019s softish jobs report means the Federal Reserve is very likely to cut interest rates by 25 basis points again at its September 17-18 meeting.\n\nWelcome back to the bad news is good news backdrop for the markets. CEOs will unlikely embrace that narrative.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
