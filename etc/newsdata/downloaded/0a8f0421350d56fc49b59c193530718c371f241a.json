(AP/Michael Wyke)\n\nAfter seven years apart, it\u2019s safe to say that Russell Westbrook is more than ready to be playing with James Harden again.\n\nThe duo officially reunited on Friday at the Houston Rockets\u2019 media day, marking the first time they\u2019ve been on the same team in the NBA since their time with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAnd with their reunion came a bit of a warning for the rest of the league.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be scary, that\u2019s all I can tell you,\u201d Westbrook said, via ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be scary \u2014 not for us.\u201d\n\nThroughout their respective time in the league, both Harden and Westbrook have turned into perhaps the best guards in the NBA.\n\nWestbrook averaged a triple-double last season for the third straight year. Harden averaged a career-high 36.1 points per game last year, and compiled a massive 32-game streak where he scored at least 30 points.\n\nThey both have a league MVP award under their belts, too, with Westbrook winning in 2016-17 and Harden in 2017-18.\n\nYet neither has won an NBA championship \u2014 and haven\u2019t even reached the NBA Finals since 2012.\n\nThat, Harden said, is the new goal in Houston.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished a lot of individual accolades,\u201d Harden said, via ESPN. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to accomplish something together that we haven\u2019t accomplished before.\u201d\n\nGetting Westbrook and Harden to work together\n\nWhile they\u2019ve played together before, a big concern for many is how coach Mike D\u2019Antoni will be able to mesh both of their games together. With both being so dominant offensively, it\u2019s a very valid question.\n\nYet with their history \u2014 the pair have been friends since they were children \u2014 Harden isn\u2019t stressed about making it work. They\u2019ll \u201cfigure it out.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cIf Russ got it going and Russ is having one of those games that we've all seen before, guess what I'm going to do: Sit back and watch the show, and vice versa,\u201d Harden said, via ESPN. \u201cIt's just a part of basketball. So you can't sit up here and say, \u2018Oh, Russ is going to have the ball for the first half and I'm going to have the ball the second half.\u2019 No, things happen through the course of the game that you just flow with and go with.\n\n\u201cAll of us in this locker room and this front office has one goal, and that's to win it. However that happens, it's going to happen, and we're just going to figure it out.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Antoni said on Friday that he will stagger their minutes this season, something that should help balance out their offense. Per the report, D\u2019Antoni plans to rest Westbrook about 16 minutes per game and sit Harden about 13 minutes per game \u2014 meaning the pair could only see the court together for a quarter and a half.\n\nRegardless, D\u2019Antoni is confident that Westbrook and his game will mesh well in Houston \u2014 even if it takes some time to figure out.\n\n\u201cIt'll work itself out. You try not to overcoach it,\u201d D'Antoni said, via ESPN. \u201cWe need Russell to be Russell. We don't want to change him. He's an MVP. That's who we need. We need his bravura to be Russell. That's good enough.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "James Harden and Russell Westbrook talked about playing together again for the first time in seven years on Friday at the Houston Rockets\u2019 media day.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OWg3wFvzlQkYUeROGBujnA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oTotBVJ75JN4n7XP9jt2Lg--~B/aD0yNzEzO3c9NDA3MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/56c49240-e1a4-11e9-b9db-9e4fc543e823", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
