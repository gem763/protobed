He\u2019ll be up first in the National League Divisional Series.\n\nPatrick Corbin will get the ball for the Nationals in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, after both Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg were required to get Washington a wild-card win Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI will tell you right now, yeah, Patrick Corbin will start Game 1,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said after the game.\n\nThe Nationals beat the Milwaukee Brewers 4-3 in the NL Wild Card Game. Scherzer pitched five innings and allowed three Brewers to score, all off home runs.

He signed a six-year contract with the Nationals last winter after starting his MLB career with the Diamondbacks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
