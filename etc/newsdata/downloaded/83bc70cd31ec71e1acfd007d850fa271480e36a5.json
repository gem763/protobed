Ahead of its inclusion at the Olympics next year, the mixed 4x400-metre relay makes its competitive debut at the Doha World Championships on Saturday when two men and two women per nation combine in track athletics\u2019 first mixed-gender event.\n\nWhether a sport that is almost unique in its level of focus afforded to men and women needs to force both genders together is a matter for debate but, as with all sports seeking to secure their status in a changing society, the buzzwords \u201cvibrancy\u201d and \u201cyouthfulness\u201d are at the forefront of explanations for innovation. So if the kids wants men and women together, that is what athletics will provide.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe theory behind the event suggests it should produce the additional excitement of huge leads being overhauled as teams are able to field their four athletes in whatever order they want. With six seconds between the world\u2019s best male and female 400m runners, there is scope for multiple dramatic overtaking opportunities.\n\nThe reality is somewhat different. Even at this early stage of the event\u2019s life, a pattern has quickly emerged: every team in the final of the World Relays earlier this year chose to line up in order of man-woman-woman-man, with the fastest runners on the lead and anchor legs.\n\nSuch uniformity is likely to cut down on the unpredictability sought when the event was first created, but its ascension to major global competition still raises a number of interesting issues.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf paramount importance is selection. With seperate men and women\u2019s 4x400m relays still on the schedule - as well as individual 400m races - each nation must decide how best to deploy their runners. Do you sacrifice the men\u2019s 4x400m relay in favour of loading your best male runners into the mixed 4x400m relay, for example?\n\nBritain, who have a whopping 15 runners to choose from across their 400m relay squads in Doha, remain typically coy about their plans, with team leader Neil Black only insisting the mixed event is \u201cas high a priority as any other relay\u201d and promising \u201ca serious team\u201d.\n\nWhile their unparalleled depth means the United States are likely to claim yet another gold medal, the event does provide the opportunity for some of the lesser nations who may not have enough runners of the same gender to challenge in conventional men and women\u2019s relays.\n\nLed by Shaunae Miller-Uibo and Steven Gardiner - two of the world\u2019s fastest individual 400m runners - Bahamas in fact beat the Americans to win the inaugural event at the 2017 World Relays, although they have opted against fielding a mixed quartet in Doha.\n\nMartyn Rooney believes mixed relay will be an exciting addition to athletics competition Credit: PA\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity for smaller countries to come through,\u201d says British 4x400m relay veteran Martyn Rooney. \u201cTeams like India and some of the South American countries who might only have two guys and two girls who are world class.\u201d\n\nRooney says the event has also posed challenges of how best to accommodate athletes of hugely varying sizes.\n\n\u201cThe training is quite interesting because there\u2019s a massive difference in heights and bodyweights,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite imposing for some of the smaller girls. You put Zoey [Clark] next to me - I\u2019m 6ft 6in and she\u2019s 5ft 5in, so it\u2019s quite tough for her when I\u2019ve been giving her a shove in the back.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s been giving it back and the girls have all become more confident and aggressive. It\u2019s going to be exciting.\u201d", "description": "A small slice of athletics history will be made this weekend.
