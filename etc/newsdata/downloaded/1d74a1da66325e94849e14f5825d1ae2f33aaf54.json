(Oct. 11) AP, AP\n\nSpeaking in a television interview Sunday morning, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said President Trump had ordered a \"deliberate withdrawal\" of U.S. forces from northern Syria, an even more comprehensive withdrawal than had been previously ordered.\n\nAppearing on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Esper told host Margaret Brennan that after discussions with the president, and as Turkish troops continued their assault against Kurdish forces further than originally expected, the decision had been made to withdraw about 1,000 troops, rather than just the 50 who had been previously ordered to withdraw.\n\n\"I spoke with the president last night after discussions with the rest of the national security team and he directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria,\" Esper said, though he declined to provide a time frame for the withdrawal.\n\nEsper's comments come as Turkey has begun a military operation in northern Syria against Kurdish groups that were allied with the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nMore: As Turkey pounds Syria, Trump downplays ties to Kurds: 'They didn't help us in the Second World War'\n\nMore: U.S. and Kurdish soldiers: Side by side just days ago, battling ISIS, now the Kurds are under attack\n\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in later Sunday on Twitter, criticizing \"endless wars\" and saying of the conflict, \"Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them!\"\n\nHe later tweeted about potential sanctions on Turkey \u2013 \"stay tuned!\" he wrote, of sanctions legislation drafted with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.\n\n.....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have slammed Trump's decision to pull back U.S. forces as potentially enabling a resurgence of the Islamic State and abandoning a U.S. ally.\n\nRep. Adam Kinziger, R-Ill., who has been highly critical of Trump's Syria policy, said later on \"Face the Nation\" of the troop withdrawal, \"it's going to be terrible and you know the secretary is doing his job and you know he has to follow orders.\"\n\nKinzinger said the decision put U.S. national security at risk and called the withdrawal \"weak.\"\n\n\"We have left them to the wolves,\" he said of the Kurds.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/13/esper-trump-ordered-deliberate-withdrawal-northern-syria/3968919002/", "description": "Turkey has begun a military operation in northern Syria against Kurdish groups that were allied with the U.S. in the fight against the Islamic State.", "authors": ["Nicholas Wu", "Published P.M.
