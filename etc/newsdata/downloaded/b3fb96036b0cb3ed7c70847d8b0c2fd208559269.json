Below is the first sijo that McCann ever wrote. [PARK SANG-MOON]\n\nWhile it\u2019s still taught in schools, sijo, the traditional three-line poetic form often compared to the Japanese haiku, is hardly a part of everyday life in Korea.There\u2019s one American, however, who\u2019s been sharing his passion for sijo with the world for the last few decades.Meet David McCann, the 75-year-old former Harvard professor of Korean literature who has done a lot with sijo - teach it, write it and perform it on a ukulele, among others.\u201cThe younger people in Korea may not be writing or reading sijo, but I think sijo\u2019s performance side may be a way for people to get interested,\u201d McCann said. The poetic form, which emerged in the Goryeo period (918-1392), has been traditionally performed in a singing style with instruments. \u201cThe person I think of is Psy of \u2018Gangnam Style.\u2019 He could do a sijo and people would be very interested.\u201dMcCann\u2019s interest in Korean literature began over fifty years ago. He developed a passion for Korean poetry when he first came to Korea in 1966 to teach English at a high school in Andong, North Gyeongsang, as part of the U.S. government-led Peace Corps. Upon returning to the United States, McCann went on to teach at Cornell University and later at Harvard, where he became the school\u2019s first professor of Korean Literature supported by the Korea Foundation, Korea\u2019s public diplomacy organization, and taught courses about writing Asian poetry.The Korea JoongAng Daily got a chance to meet with McCann on Oct. 18 and discuss his efforts to raise awareness of sijo and insights into the Korea literary scene. McCann was recently invited to visit Seoul and Andong as part of an appreciation program organized by the Korea Foundation for former Peace Corps volunteers. The following are edited excerpts from the interview.. The change in the last 50 years is breathtaking. In the 1960s, South Korea was one of the poorest countries in the world. Its per capita income was lower than North Korea\u2019s.The old Andong is gone. Before, the only paved street in the whole town was just in front of the railroad station. Everything else was just a dirt road. In Seoul\u2019s City Hall plaza there were ox carts going through - it was just a completely different setting. The urbanization of Korea has been extraordinary.One day at a bookstore in Andong, I noticed a small book with a red cover. In the 1960s there were no books with red covers, because red was communist. So I was very curious and took it out the shelf, and it was a collection of poems by Kim Sowol. I opened up the book and there were English translations and the original Korean, and I thought I could improve my Korean language with it.What I discovered, to my surprise, was the original language poems just drew me in, and before I knew it, I had memorized several of them.Kim Sowol is known as a folk song poet and I realized that there are other sung forms of traditional poetry, so I thought I would work on those. I read Chong Pyong-uk\u2019s \u201cDictionary of Sijo Literature\u201d when I was in Harvard before I came back on a Fulbright grant in 1973.I was studying sijo primarily as a literary form when I was working on my Ph.D. dissertation. It wasn\u2019t until when I was in Korea that I began to find out how much enjoyment and appreciation there was for sijo as a sung form and its performance dimension.I published my own book of sijo in English and that was translated into Korean. I\u2019ve been writing poetry in sijo and I\u2019ve taught it to students in my class on writing Asian poetry. I\u2019ve been working with the Sejong Cultural Society in Chicago, which has an annual sijo contest.About 10 years ago, when Kathleen Stephens was the U.S. Ambassador to Korea, she came to Harvard for a presentation and I was at a luncheon with her and I got talking about the sijo. I said, \u201cIf you think it might work, it might be fun to have a sijo workshop in Korea through the U.S. Embassy.\u201d She came up with the idea of having a sijo contest and she hosted it at the ambassador\u2019s residence. There were about 30 students and they sat down on the floor in the traditional style, just like the Confucian state examination. I served as one of the judges.I think sijo is a very different kind of poetry. In haiku, you cannot let yourself go into the poem, you keep yourself back. In sijo, the self can be right there. The voice can be the poet\u2019s voice.Also when you look at sijo, the first line introduces the subject, the second develops it and the third line you have the turn and the resolution of the poem. That is exactly the form of the freshman writing essay at Harvard University. It\u2019s in 4 parts: introduction, development, turn - consider another direction - and conclude. The sijo can be studied as a very effective form for presentation of a view.I do. But there\u2019s also a number of sijo I\u2019ve written where they break loose and arrange themselves differently on the page.When we go up to our family cottage in Maine in August and September, directly in front of it is the ocean. I sit on the front steps and write poetry. It was interesting on Wednesday going down to Andong on the bus and looking at the landscape. All of a sudden I started writing poetry. The landscape does that. I like to experiment with the form but I do have the three lines and the twist in my mind.It\u2019s a difficult thing to understand. Maybe 15 years ago I would get letters from the Nobel committee asking me to send a letter to inform them of poets or novelists that I may suggest for them to consider. They were quite actively reaching out to me, but also to [other] international literature [experts] to see who\u2019s out there.I don\u2019t know why, but I think they sort of closed on in their thinking of literature now. I think they\u2019re much more focused on European writers. But Korean writers have gotten international prizes in England and elsewhere. And I think the international recognition and enthusiastic interest is growing. I don\u2019t think poetry has quite the same, strong connection, but that\u2019s changing. There\u2019s been a really fine collection of poetry published in the last few years.That was a huge shock. I had translated a book of poems by Ko called \u201cTraveler Maps,\u201d and my former student Wayne de Fremery put the translations and the originals into a fold-up, like an actual map 20 years ago. Very soon after it came out, there was a reading in Washington, D.C., where Ko Un and I shared the stage and he would read the poem in the original and I would read the translation.Somebody in Andong actually mentioned that you can\u2019t get into a poem on a flat screen. It\u2019s not the same as a page, and that does concern me. I think it\u2019ll be an increasingly difficult challenge to get people to appreciate the sijo if it only appears on the screen, but that applies to poetry in general.However, on the screen people do find other ways to express ideas. When you look at emojis, for example, those little symbols are like Chinese hanja [characters]. A week ago my daughter sent me a \u201cHave a good trip\u201d message and it had four little images of a house, taxi, airplane and a happy face. It was like a line from a Chinese poem.Sleeping (laughs). I\u2019ve got really simple wishes. I want to spend more time with family and friends. My wife and I love to travel together - we\u2019ve been recently in Europe and Hawaii.But I also want to keep writing poetry and connect with other groups of poets and publishers like Sejong Cultural Society. When I was in Korea in June, I gave a talk in Seoul for the Sijo Poets Association and went down to Busan and gave another talk. I want to keep doing what I can for the development of sijo and for my own personal interest. I want to keep writing poetry.BY KIM EUN-JIN [kim.eunjin1@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/29182235.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
