(Photo: Special to the Statesman Journal)\n\nDETROIT, Ore. \u2013 Robb Campbell wasn\u2019t sure his 911 call worked.\n\nLost in a fierce snowstorm and wandering 7 miles from where he was supposed to be hiking on the Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon, he made a desperate call for help.\n\nBut the call dropped part-way through, and he was knee-deep in fresh snow with no idea whether anyone was coming.\n\nWithout food, his gear soaked and fighting blizzard-like conditions, the veteran backpacker knew that if he didn\u2019t find someone, he wasn\u2019t going to last long.\n\n\u201cYou just know, if anything happens, I\u2019m dead,\u201d Campbell told the Statesman Journal Saturday. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to find me until Spring.\u201d\n\nLost since Thursday, his best break came Friday when he found temporary shelter inside a pit toilet at Breitenbush Lake.\n\nNot long after that, Marion County Sheriff's Search and Rescue deputies Mark Knospe and Mark Ferran found Campbell at about 2:30 p.m. after spotting and tracking his fresh foot prints.\n\nThe All-Seasons Motel in Detroit gave the 50-year-old from the East Coast a complimentary room Friday night and he will pay to stay there the next two nights while he recovers from his ordeal, including frostbite to his feet.\n\n\u201cYou count your blessings,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cYou thank your lucky stars. Not to be overly dramatic, because people have been through much worse, I\u2019m sure. But I wouldn\u2019t have survived another night. I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d\n\nAfter being lost in blizzard conditions in the Willamette National Forest and eventually found by a Search and Rescue team, Robb Campbell recovers from minor frost bite at the All Seasons Motel in Detroit, Oregon, on October 19, 2019. Campbell has been hiking the Pacific Crest Trail since May, and intends to finish the trail.

It runs from Mexico to Canada over 2,650 miles, including the length of Oregon.\n\nPerhaps the most notable person to hike the trail was Cheryl Strayed, who wrote a book, \"Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail,\" about her experience. Later it was turned into the Reese Witherspoon movie \"Wild.\"\n\nRobb Campbell reaches mile 2,000 on his journey hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.

On Wednesday, the snow followed and chilled him to the bone. He tried following the Pacific Crest Trail up the ascent to the steepest point, but he got lost in a whiteout and ended up hiking 7 miles off the trail.\n\nLost hiker found: 73-year-old survived alone for a week in California mountains\n\nWhen he recognized his dilemma Thursday, he made his call to 911 but had no idea the 911 operator triangulated his location with a satellite.\n\nThen he stepped in a crack between boulders and to free his foot had to dig down, remove his shoe, pull his leg out and then his shoe.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be feeling sorry for yourself,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cNow is the time to grab you by your bootstraps. What really had me worried, though, was I was out of food for two days. I was really worried about losing the energy. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want to waste time.\u201d\n\nUsing an app on his phone that he had been using to navigate the trail, he headed toward Breitenbush Lake. When he arrived, it was blanketed in snow \u2013 the only signs of life were the tire tracks of a truck.\n\nIt turned out, that truck was Ferran and Knospe, and they passed by in their search for him.\n\nAfter his rescue, Campbell was checked over by a paramedic and told he had severe frostbite on one foot, but was otherwise fine after he warmed up. Afterward, he ate some lasagna.\n\nAfter being lost in blizzard conditions in the Willamette National Forest and eventually found by a Search and Rescue team, Robb Campbell recovers from minor frost bite at the All Seasons Motel in Detroit, Oregon, on October 19, 2019. Campbell has been hiking the Pacific Crest Trail since May, and intends to finish the trail.
