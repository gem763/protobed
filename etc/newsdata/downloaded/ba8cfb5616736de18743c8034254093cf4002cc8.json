Such rhetoric could be skilfully deployed to stir latent imperial sensibilities while simultaneously disavowing them. Upon his resignation as Foreign Secretary in July 2018, Johnson recalled his arrival at the Durbar Court in the Foreign Office two years earlier where he \u2018announced a vision\u2019:\n\n\u2018It was time \u2026 for Global Britain. And by Global Britain I meant a country that was more open, more outward-looking, more engaged with the world than ever before. It meant taking the referendum and using it as an opportunity to rediscover some of the dynamism of these bearded Victorians; not to build a new empire, heaven forfend \u2026.\u2019\n\n\u2018Heaven forfend\u2019? The reason for protesting so much was surely the weight of Johnson\u2019s own words, deftly calibrated to conjure the very object he abjured. Whether invoking Global Britain in the same breath as \u2018empires of the mind\u2019, or drawing more coded comparisons with the bearded dynamism of the Victorian age, Johnson exhibited his extraordinary capacity for having it both ways. Cake, and the eating all in one.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg deployed a variation on the technique, casting back to the nineteenth century for \u2018good historic precedent for what we are trying to do\u2019 while simultaneously insisting that there was no \u2018neo-imperial vision\u2019 (the empire, after all, was but one mere aspect of Britain\u2019s traditional \u2018international and global approach\u2019). Such disclaimers only enhanced the desired effect, simply by placing Global Britain in the same semantic frame as its imperial antecedents.\n\nThey also fuelled suspicion that the Government\u2019s advocacy of \u2018Global Britain\u2019 was an exercise in cynical euphemism \u2013 conjuring older, discredited enthusiasms that could no longer be articulated in polite company. The Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee took the extraordinary step of launching an official inquiry into the term itself, concluding that Global Britain, in its very vagueness, carried the risk \u2018of undermining UK interests by damaging our reputation overseas\u2019 \u2013 not least if the prevailing uncertainty and confusion about its historical resonances went unchecked. Yet this in no way dampened Boris Johnson\u2019s enthusiasm for his brainchild, repeating the phrase at the close of his first major speech as Prime Minister against the backdrop of 10 Downing Street.\n\nThat this is more than mere window-dressing is amply demonstrated by the current impasse over the EU withdrawal agreement \u2013 particularly the much-maligned Irish \u2018backstop\u2019. The inherent contradiction in leaving a customs union while maintaining \u2018frictionless\u2019 trade over the Irish border might have been more easily managed, were it not for the Brexiteers\u2019 fixation with negotiating \u2018new trade agreements\u2019 with the world beyond Europe.\n\nThis has remained an article of faith through three years of negotiations, and is the principal reason why solutions based on zero tariffs and regulatory alignment have failed to win support among Brexit hardliners. If the ultimate goal is to secure the right to compete with the EU in third markets, using tariffs and alternative product standards as bargaining tools, it becomes so much harder to accept harmonisation with EU standards as the price of allowing goods and services to flow across the Northern Irish border unchecked.\n\nFormer Commonwealth countries like Australia, Canada and New Zealand have been at the forefront of Brexiteer rhetoric about striking new trade deals, even though these countries account for only a fraction of UK trade compared with the EU. The situation was the exact opposite sixty years ago, when Britain\u2019s first overtures to joining the \u2018Common Market\u2019 (as it was then known) were hindered by the vast network of preferential trading deals with Commonwealth countries that could not easily be reconciled with a European customs union. \u2018We are not entitled to sell our friends and kinsmen down the river for a problematical and marginal advantage of selling washing machines in Dusseldorf\u2019, protested Labour\u2019s Harold Wilson from the Opposition benches in 1961, but within a few years he too was persuaded by the necessity of a European trading future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Australia, the realisation that Britain was prepared to sacrifice the interests of Commonwealth primary producers in order to trade with more lucrative European competitors provided the necessary shock to embark on a more Asian-oriented trading future. It was a process heavily overlaid with notions of filial duty within the Commonwealth \u2018family\u2019. Cartoonists had a field day depicting Britain variously as the neglectful mother, the wayward spouse, the fair-weather friend, while whispers of \u2018ingratitude\u2019 for wartime sacrifices were frequently insinuated. But by the time Britain finally negotiated entry in 1973, the process of adjustment \u2013 emotional as much as economic \u2013 was already well under way.\n\nWhich only makes the recrudescence of the Commonwealth in the politics of Brexit seem all the more extraordinary. Within a week of the June 2016 referendum, David Howell \u2013 former Thatcher Minister and President of the Royal Commonwealth Society \u2013 announced in the pages of London\u2019s Daily Telegraph: \u2018A bright future awaits Britain post-Brexit in the Commonwealth markets\u2019. This, despite the fact that virtually every major Commonwealth Government at the time had given little encouragement to the idea. But despite its shaky political and economic foundations, the proposition draws persuasive power from unextinguished memories of British global preeminence.\n\n\"For God\u2019s sake let\u2019s just get on, I mean, we\u2019re British. We stood alone for years \u2026 Let\u2019s get back to being a British empire again.\" \u2014 Leave supporter attending a Save Brexit rally in Yorkshire in October 2018\n\nIt also draws encouragement from residual voices in Australia equally in thrall to the open vistas of the rearview mirror. Tony Abbott has contributed frequently to the Brexit debate, most recently in a bid to rouse the passions of a people who had \u2018seen off the Spanish Armada, the French Emperor and the German Kaiser \u2026 No country should be more capable of standing on its own feet\u2019. He depicted the imminent restoration of \u2018the unrestricted commerce that we enjoyed for 150 years\u2019 as a species of historic vindication of Australia\u2019s truest loyalties \u2013 indeed, \u2018the best 2019 Christmas present either of us could have\u2019.\n\nNot everyone is convinced that the contemporary duel over Brexit is steeped in the memory of empire. Dissenting voices strike a note of caution against the rush to hasty judgement, pointing to the many ways in which the Brexit vote signalled an assortment of rival impulses \u2013 often starkly at odds with a pent-up desire to embrace the global dispensation of former times.\n\nJanan Ganesh views the voter backlash against the twin-spectre of globalisation and inward migration as the very opposite of a resurgent empire \u2013 a species of battening down the hatches, driven by a collective desire for \u2018less of the world, not more\u2019. Robert Saunders takes a different view, pointing to the equally empire-laden longings of EU-enthusiasts in their ready presumption that Britain was destined to \u2018lead\u2019 in Europe. At the very least, he argues, we should \u2018resist the temptation to project solely onto Leave voters irrational and pathological motives\u2019.\n\nIt is far from certain precisely what the British people make of their fallen empire, whether it presents a symbol of lost latitude in a world that has left them behind, or a source of indelible shame at the record of unbridled land theft, violence and plunder. Intriguingly, the anecdotal evidence of Brexit lends support to both sides of the equation, attesting to the positive as well as negative shared memory of empire. The ever-readiness of Remain supporters to tar Brexit with an imperial brush speaks to one set of emotions, but there are equally compelling reasons why leading Brexiteers persist with backward-looking motifs to evoke the boundless possibilities of leaving the EU.\n\nOne ardent Leave supporter attending a Save Brexit rally in Yorkshire in October 2018 achieved momentary notoriety for airing his unrepentant views in the presence of a Sky News crew: \u2018For God\u2019s sake let\u2019s just get on, I mean, we\u2019re British. We stood alone for years \u2026 Let\u2019s get back to being a British empire again. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about you know? It\u2019s about being a British empire\u2019. The sense of the empire cat escaping from the Brexit bag was palpable. But others are scathing of the flagrant misuse of the empire tag, which they see as little more than a gratuitous slur against Britain\u2019s good name, cynically deployed by Remainers to \u2018shut down the opposition\u2019.\n\nJohn Denham of the Centre for English Identity and Politics attributes the serial ruptures of the Brexit moment to a failure to understand contemporary Englishness \u2013 a political force frequently stigmatised as \u2018racist, backward-looking, imperialistic and xenophobic\u2019. More attention is needed, he says, to the alienation and resentment of these ordinary, decent people embodying an ethos of hard work and public service. If they are \u2018nostalgic, he insists, \u2018it is less for empire than for the place they once held at the centre of national life\u2019.\n\nBut this overlooks the empire\u2019s residual force as a stark reminder of that lost pre-eminence, furnishing an easily recognisable symbol of a time when Britain was very much \u2018in control\u2019, not just of its own destiny but also that of countless others. Britain\u2019s marginalisation on the world stage over the last half century serves as a potent metaphor for the diminished status felt by many ordinary Britons in their own country \u2013 which is not the same as\n\nsaying they want the empire back.\n\nThe British empire is indeed history. There remain few political or economic vestiges that might explain these enduring entanglements, little trace of the material fragments from which the empire might be refashioned. What\u2019s left are certain habits of mind and unstructured feelings \u2013 an almost ethereal presence, stirring lingering resentments rather than covert longings to restore its former glory.\n\nStuart Ward is Professor and Head of the Saxo Institute at Copenhagen University.\n\nThis piece is partly based on an extract from the recently published Embers of Empire in Brexit Britain (with Astrid Rasch, Bloomsbury, 2019).", "description": "There's more than a whiff of imperialism in the 'global Britain' evoked by Brexit's ardent fans, including former Australian PM Tony Abbott.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.192%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_97/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e42c6fd111931da50f58f67eed1fc70333bfe8c6", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
