For the men who suffer from erectile dysfunction the drug is a real lifesaver.\u201d\n\nThe drug is particularly used by men who have had surgery for prostate cancer, and for diabetes sufferers.\n\nKaren Stalbow, head of policy, knowledge and impact at Prostate Cancer UK, said: \u201cAlprostadil is an important treatment for some men with prostate cancer who are experiencing erectile dysfunction following surgery. We have recently been investigating shortages in this particular treatment which men have been experiencing. It is important that action is taken to ensure that these treatments are available for the men that need them.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Pfizer said: \u201cWe are aware Caverject has been included on the government\u2019s list of medicines to protect supplies for patients in the UK. We will continue to work with the Department of Health and Social Care to support the effective supply of all Pfizer medicines for patients in the UK. There are five formulations of alprostadil available in the UK , three of which have sufficient supply while the other two are currently experiencing supply issues.\u201d", "description": "The Government has banned export of an erectile dysfunction drug - because there is not enough to meet Britain\u2019s needs.", "authors": ["Laura Donnelly", "Health Editor", "Allister Heath", "Fraser Nelson", "Jacob Rees-Mogg", "Madeline Grant", "Iain Duncan Smith"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/17/01DA4354000003E8-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqrpfQw2hJyG_yckwxPAr0gqsW2GA9nAM4IFtGNFTInME.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
