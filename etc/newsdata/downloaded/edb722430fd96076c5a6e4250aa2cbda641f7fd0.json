(AP) - A Delaware school district played a parody version of the national anthem before a volleyball match this week, surprising spectators with Roseanne Barr\u2019s screeching 1990s rendition.\n\nThe News Journal of Wilmington reports the Seaford School District apologized Wednesday for the shock at its Tuesday game with Milford High.\n\nA letter by Superintendent David Perrington says pre-game proceedings will be improved, per an investigation into the lapse. Officials didn\u2019t immediately explain how Barr\u2019s version, performed before a San Diego Padres game, came to be used.\n\nIt says the district usually plays the national anthem before sports games as a way to honor the country and its armed forces. It says the district will use a district-approved version in the future.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., http://www.delawareonline.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Delaware school district played a parody version of the national anthem before a volleyball match this week, surprising spectators with Roseanne Barr's screeching 1990s rendition.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
