Google Translate\u2019s camera app didn\u2019t help. \u201cBulgaria!\u201d the label read when I scanned it with my phone, \u20184 arrange the lance! Of bacteria in the hen! Tummy Keep Good.\u201d You get used to it. There are awkward bits and pieces of English all around Japan. \u201cLet\u2019s watch the great power of live battle of men on the big screen!\u201d is my favourite, from a poster advertising a rugby fanzone in Fuchu. The jacket-back slogan \u201cvigorous throw-up \u2013 since 1973\u201d is a close second.\n\nHomeward bound: The lesser known lights who shone in World Cup pool stages Read more\n\nIt isn\u2019t easy getting this stuff right. Just ask your friend in that Superdry hoodie, the one with \u201cextreme speed try test\u201d written across the front in kanji. There are plenty of Japanese words that even the experts struggle to translate exactly. Like doryoku, which comes up over and again when you\u2019re reading or talking about Japanese sport. It means effort, yes, but ability, striving and endeavour, too. And all that still doesn\u2019t quite capture its significance.\n\nFortunately there\u2019s all sorts of lore about the men and women who personified doryoku. Like the champion baseball team at Ichiko school, who used to have a workout regimen called \u201cbloody urine\u201d because they practiced so hard they\u2019d piss red at the end of the day. Or the \u201cdeath training\u201d philosophy of the famous Waseda baseball coach Suishu Tobita, who wrote \u201cif the players don\u2019t try so hard as to vomit blood in practice, then they cannot hope to win games\u201d.\n\nThe history of Koshien, Japan\u2019s high school baseball tournament, seems to be full of these stories. Like how the legendary Sadaharu Oh won the title for his school by pitching four games in four days even though he had blisters so bad the blood was dripping down his fingers onto the ball. When he grew up, Oh would to sign his autographs \u201cdoryoku\u201d. These are all old and well-worn stories now, and overly-familiar to anyone who knows them, but new for the rest of us.\n\nIt was doryoku I saw at Yamanote high school, where the kids in the first XV were doing six hours training a day, six days a week. And doryoku I heard about in the words of three teenagers who had come over from New Zealand to play there, when they spoke with awe about how much training they were being made to do. \u201cBack in New Zealand we were training twice a week, here we are training every day, so it\u2019s way more intense,\u201d one of them said, \u201cand these guys are just monsters in gym, they spend too much time there, they all want to get big to climb over everyone they play.\u201d\n\nThose kids at Yamanote weren\u2019t the first foreigners to struggle with the concept. The baseball writer Robert Whiting filled his brilliant book, You Gotta Have Wa, with stories about overseas pros who struggled to cope with the workload. Like the former Major League Baseball all-star Davey Johnson, who flopped at the Yomiuri Giants because the endless batting practice gave him a neuroma. And they still wouldn\u2019t let him sit out training.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Japan\u2019s players work hard in the gym on Tuesday in preparation for Sunday\u2019s World Cup quarter-final against the Springboks in Tokyo.

Hirose spent two years playing as Japan\u2019s captain under Eddie Jones. He quit in 2015, but four years later he still winces when you ask him what it was like. \u201cVery hard,\u201d he said, shaking his head, \u201cvery, very hard.\u201d But Hirose had come up through Japan\u2019s high school system, same as his teammates, and what I couldn\u2019t work out was how Jones could have worked him any harder than he was already used to.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hirose explained, \u201cin Japan, we always do very long training, even from when we\u2019re very young, but we don\u2019t always do very good training, that\u2019s the difference.\u201d With Jones, he said, it was more about quantity than quality. \u201cEddie made us train for a short time but at a very high intensity.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a clear echo here of another of the characters in Whiting\u2019s book, the coach Don Blasingame, who was one of the first foreigners to manage a top Japanese baseball team. Blasingame had spent 14 years in Japan as a player and coach when he took over at the Hanshin Tigers in 1979, but it still didn\u2019t work. Blasingame reckoned one of the big problems was that his players were training so hard that they were getting tired in the back half of the season. Just like Jones he told his team it wasn\u2019t how long they practiced that mattered, but how well. He cut down spring camp and practice sessions to half the amount the other teams were doing. The Japanese players hated it. Blasingame was fired after a season and a half.\n\nJapan and All Blacks aim for greater rewards on showcase weekend | Robert Kitson Read more\n\nThat was 40 years ago though, and this Japan team have managed to fold together the traditional Japanese way of doing things with what Jones and his successor Jamie Joseph learned in Australia and New Zealand. The doryoku is still there. You can see it in their fitness levels, and their frantic speed of play. But their game is about more than hard work now. There are some powerful emotional currents pulling this Japanese team through this World Cup. Joseph wasn\u2019t exaggerating when he said his team are being \u201cdriven and supported by the whole country\u201d. More than 60 million people tuned in to watch them beat Scotland. They must appreciate the doryoku, but maybe they\u2019re learning, too, that effort is never enough in itself.
