And with an increasing interest in the spirit, 2020 is set to be a great year for British bourbon drinkers.\n\nTo give you a taste of what\u2019s in store, we\u2019ve rounded up some of those new arrivals that are worthy of further investigation, along with a few older classics for anyone looking to try bourbon for the first time or wanting some variety on their bourbon shelf.\n\nTo qualify as a bourbon, the spirit must be made in the US from a minimum of 51 per cent corn and aged in charred new oak. Anyone wondering why Jack Daniels isn\u2019t in this list, then it\u2019s because, although close, it\u2019s technically not a bourbon.\n\nBut there are plenty of alternatives here to get your taste buds going. Read on to find out which bourbons made the cut.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

This more expensive release was launched as a tie-in with the movie Kingsman: The Golden Circle, but don\u2019t let that marketing mechanism put you off \u2013 it\u2019s well worth the extra cost. The aroma is of vanilla with a background hint of sweet bubblegum, with more spices including cinnamon and clove joining upon sipping. Those spices are initially served in a smooth, buttery texture but they gradually break free providing warmth and leathery comforts. A fresh orange zestiness helps keep the bourbon lively, while you steadily become more relaxed under the spell of its boozy charms.\n\nBuy now\n\nRebel Yell French oak barrel special finish, 45%, 700ml: \u00a330, Master of Malt\n\nHere\u2019s a rare chance for UK whisky drinkers to get one up on Americans \u2013 this small batch bourbon from Lux Row distillers is being released first in the UK before hitting a few European markets and won\u2019t be made available in the US. It uses the original Rebel Yell wheated recipe and has been finished in toasted French oak for six months, with that extra time in wood giving it some gingery fire in its belly. Along with the spice there\u2019s chocolate, steamy fruit pie and cereal on the palate with a slight creaminess tempering the flames. It\u2019s a special treat for UK bourbon fans, and even more so given its generously low price tag.\n\nAvailable from mid-November\n\nThat Boutique-y Whisky Company bourbon whisky #1 24 year old, 48%, 500ml: \u00a3199.95, Master of Malt\n\nThat Boutique-y Whisky Company is an independent bottler delivering a fantastic lineup of limited edition whiskies that have only recently entered the bourbon market, with this being its first release. It may be a little pricey but with a limited run of just over 8,376 bottles, and an age statement of 24 years, they\u2019ve certainly hit the scene with a bang. As you might expect from such a mature bourbon, the flavours are rich and fruity with with lots oak drying out the taste buds, but this effect is beautifully balanced by a soft, buttery texture and some sweeter, chocolatey toffee notes. It\u2019s a superb whisky that\u2019s well worth trying \u2013 so if the high price puts you off then consider one of the 3CL drams which offer a more affordable treat.\n\nBuy now\n\nLegent bourbon, 47%, 700ml: \u00a347.95, The Whiskey Exchange\n\nLegent is a new bourbon collaboration between two legends of the whisky world. Fred Noe (seventh generation Jim Beam master distiller) was responsible for distilling the whisky to an old Jim Beam recipe, and Suntory\u2019s chief blender, Shinji Fukoyo, took over blending duties. The bourbon has been finished in a combination of wine and sherry casks and is billed as an \u201ceast meets west\u201d bourbon, with berry and fruit flavours teased from those finishing casks to compliment the spicy oak flavours.\n\nThere\u2019s an instant sherry-sweetness to the aroma, which is carried through to the flavour, and the toasty grains seem to take on something of a vinous feel. There\u2019s also quite a lot of brightness in this bourbon, the spices often emerging with a spring in their step, but those deeper notes of dried fruits and toasted nuts continue to play long after the whisky is finished.\n\nBuy now\n\nWild Turkey longbranch, 43%, 700ml: \u00a347.95, The Whisky Exchange\n\nThis bourbon is another collaborative creation, with Wild Turkey\u2019s distilling team taking input from the company\u2019s creative director, actor Matthew McConaughey. The spirit has received a double charcoal filtration, initially using American oak before being introduced to Texas mesquite wood, a nod to McConaughey\u2019s home state. This Kentucky-Texas partnership has produced a bourbon that isn\u2019t too challenging but has some good depth of flavour to it, mostly of the toasty, nutty kind. There\u2019s some corn sweetness, most evident in the aroma, and the spices are warm and soothing, while the oak flavours have a charred edge to them. We\u2019ve seen our fair share of poorly conceived celebratory-endorsed drinks, but Longbranch bucks that trend and deserves to be afforded star billing.\n\nBuy now\n\nMaker\u2019s Mark 46, 47%, 700ml: \u00a338.99, Distillers Direct\n\nBourbon producers are increasingly looking at ways in which wood can push flavours into new directions. For this spirit, Maker\u2019s Mark inserted seared virgin French oak staves into their cask strength matured bourbon and gave it another nine weeks in the cellar. This higher proof bourbon is much livelier than the classic Maker\u2019s Mark, kicking in with a whack of cinnamon and mulling spices alongside some juicy sweetness before finishing with some earthy green pepper flavours. The original version is a great introduction to the spirit; this edition is for bourbon drinkers in need of a more flavourful experience.\n\nBuy now\n\nFEW bourbon whisky, 46.5%, 700ml: \u00a350.89, Drinks Supermarket\n\nWhatever the year, we can always find room for a handsomely designed bottle of FEW bourbon on our must-buy list. The Chicago distillery, founded in 2011, supplements the necessary amount of corn with northern rye and a pinch of malt, and it crackles with character and flavour. That rye triggers the spice with every sip, whether consumed neat or as part of a punchy cocktail, while the malt gives it a polish around the edges to smooth its progress. It has a slightly oily texture and a touch of toasty sweetness, but it\u2019s those spices that most impress \u2013 mingling and lingering long after your last sip.\n\nBuy now\n\nSonoma Distilling Co, cherrywood smoked bourbon, 47.8%, 700ml: \u00a354.85, Master of Malt\n\nCalifornians often do things a little differently to the rest of America so it\u2019s not a surprise to discover that this unusual amber booze is a product of the golden state. Along with local and Canadian corn and rye, the distillers have introduced some cherrywood smoked barley from Wyoming into the mix, imbuing the oaky vanilla flavours with a sprinkling of ash. Although no actual cherries participated in the process, there\u2019s a definite hint of kirschwasser about the booze. It\u2019s a lovely bourbon that\u2019s full of classic whisky character along with a few Californian twists.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Bourbons\n\nWith so many new bourbons now available alongside established classics, choosing one bottle is a trickier-than-ever task, but our top choice is Old Foreseter\u2019s cinematically inspired statesman bourbon.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
