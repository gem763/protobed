She performs live monthly at Union Hall with her sketch group, Lo-Fi NYC, and with her comedy partner, Rachel Pegram, in their variety show, ThatShitRay, which has its own podcast on Earwolf.\n\nThis week, Rachel and I chatted about Jewish American culture, the power ladies of SNL, and Weezy F. Baby (don\u2019t forget the F).\n\nFound footage of me being kosher pic.twitter.com/mDly8uAUxY \u2014 (((RachelJoravsky))) (@rayjay3k) October 2, 2019\n\nOkay, this one is so important to me. Motherfuckers really slept on this one, so I\u2019m glad we\u2019re revisiting. I do identify as a queer power Jewess, and I love showing up as such on Twitter. Twitter and the internet in general are such unsafe places for Jews, queer folx, and POC. Since I\u2019m two of those identities, I really try to \u201cput on for my city,\u201d so to speak. A few years back, these alt-right groups created this visual dog whistle to identify Jewish journalists and then harass them \u2014 it\u2019s three parentheses facing each other: ((( ))). I chose to put that around my own name to identify myself and send the general message of \u201cI AIN\u2019T NEVA SCARED,\u201d just to quote that Bone Crusher song from 2013. In general, I love putting Jewish content up on Twitter, even though I know it\u2019s only relevant to like a quarter of my followers (maybe less), but tbh I\u2019m ultimately doing this for me. Also the concept of pussy being kosher is very funny to me and honestly should be funny to everyone.\n\nWhat made you decide to pursue comedy as a career?\n\nI was a goofy kid. As the youngest sibling, the best way to get my family to pay attention to me was to entertain them. We used to do a lot of bits in my house like lip-sync competitions or shooting home videos. I remember Googling the lyrics to Usher\u2019s \u201cU Got It Bad\u201d and lip-syncing it for my parents in the living room. I\u2019m sure they were like, How did we make her? In grammar school, I fell in love with power women of SNL \u2014 Tina [Fey], Maya [Rudolph], Amy [Poehler], Rachel Dratch, later Kristen Wiig. Around that same time, I attended a fine-arts magnet school in Chicago, and drama was a part of the curriculum. I did a ton of plays and was a total character actress. I played Fagan (okay, typecast) in my eighth grade\u2019s production of Oliver and researched how to do a full Yiddish accent. There was just such an intense validation in making others laugh for me.\n\nDo you think social media has changed the comedy industry at all?\n\nFor sure, it\u2019s changed it. It\u2019s created a lot of opportunity for folks who are masters of the medium. Personally, I can be a private person. If I\u2019m depressed, I don\u2019t want to tweet or post. I mean, I guess I could post about how depressed I am, but that shit\u2019s not cute lol \u2026 JK. I mean, some people do it and really rock it; it\u2019s not me. If you\u2019re someone who knows how to find your audience online, it can really launch you.\n\nIs this song blue lives matter? Asking for a (white) friend. pic.twitter.com/18vPXzGkPJ \u2014 (((RachelJoravsky))) (@rayjay3k) March 20, 2019\n\nLOL, laughing at my own tweet. Culturally, I\u2019m very much rooted in the years 2006 to 2010. I also love to poke fun at thirsty white ally culture. I have a whole solo show about it called Thirsty White Ally. White people trying to get it right and out-\u201cwoke\u201d each other is very absurd and annoying, and I like to make fun of it. Especially because I catch myself being one of those white people from time to time. And I\u2019m like GETCHO BIG (\n\nHow do you think your background has shaped your comedy?\n\nIn every way lol. I was surrounded by this mix of Jewish American culture (Mel Brooks, Woody Allen tbh, Fran Drescher) and black American culture (B.A.P.S., Scary Movie 1 & 2, 106 & Park). At 11, I was aesthetically the Ashkenazi Lil\u2019 Bow Wow \u2014 terrycloth Rocawear jumpsuits and cornrows in my scalp till it smelled like a belly button, which is, by the way, the price white girls pay for cultural appropriation. Like, natural consequences, bitch! I was definitely grappling with my identity, but there\u2019s a humor to that. It\u2019s like a person constantly trying hard and just slightly missing the mark. Most of the characters I write for myself today are based around that concept: good intentions not panning out.\n\nTell us about ThatShitRay, the show you co-host with another incredibly funny Rachel. What motivated it?\n\nThatShitRay is my safe space. Rachel Pegram is a such a fucking talented powerhouse, and I thank gay, black, Jewish God every day that SHE bestowed me with the gift that is Rachel. Pegram and I met at NYU in a sketch-comedy group called Hammerkatz. I was very thirsty to be her friend, and she was like, \u201cOkay, fine,\u201d and eventually let me in. Tbh, I hooked her up with my friend from high school\u2019s ID while Rachel was still underage, and I\u2019m pretty sure that sealed the friendship.\n\nThatShitRay is a comedic exploration of the daily hustle, a celebration of the scrappy. Pegram and I had inverse experiences \u2014 I was a queer white Jew in black spaces making sense of the parts of my identity that were privileged and the parts that were othered. Pegram grew up in Denton, Texas, navigating two different worlds \u2014 a predominantly black church and mostly white school. However, both of us were used to confronting expectations projected on us based on our identities and the spaces we occupied.\n\nWhen we started conceptualizing ThatShitRay, we wanted to create an opportunity for comedy that uplifted the scrappy and marginalized. We wanted to showcase our strong sketch and character background but also be able to tell our stories and celebrate the culture of us. A culture that is essentially two gritty-broke bitches getting it done and making a single meal stretch to three!\n\nWe put out a podcast with Earwolf and are hoping to do more in the pod realm. Love using pod.\n\nStarting the electric slide in an Atlanta strip club has been my greatest community building triumph to date \u2014 (((RachelJoravsky))) (@rayjay3k) June 3, 2019\n\nThis was based on true events. I went to this strip club in Atlanta called the Clermont Lounge for one of my best friends\u2019 bachelorettes. It is the oldest strip club in ATL, and it\u2019s known for being body positive and the dancers being mostly middle-aged women. I had low expectations for the whole experience, and then I ended up having truly the time of my life. It was such a classic crew in that place. Incredibly diverse both racially and generationally \u2014 like plenty of uncles and aunties, and I loved it. It truly felt like prom night for me emotionally. I ended up starting the Electric Slide and everyone joined in, old heads included. I felt like I was really a part of something.\n\nHave you accomplished anything since at the level of successfully starting the Electric Slide at the Clermont Lounge?\n\nThat is a really great question. The Electric Slide in Clermont was truly community building at its best, and I don\u2019t know if I can top it. I did, on that same trip to Clermont, buy weed from a bouncer in the club, which felt like a huge win. However, I also recently Milly Rocked for a group of 11-year-old Jewish boys, and they chanted my name and honestly I felt like a god.", "description": "Talking with New York\u2013based comedian, writer, and performer Rachel Joravsky about Jewish American culture, the power ladies of SNL, and writing funny tweets.", "authors": ["Taylor Garron"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/18/18-rachel-joravsky.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
