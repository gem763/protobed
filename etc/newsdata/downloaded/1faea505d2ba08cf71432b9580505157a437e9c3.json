She grew louder, her voice rising with each word: \u201cFrom this day forward, we commit that not one more school, not one more hospital, not one more post office, not one more grocery store \u2014 should close on our watch!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDignitaries from across West Virginia \u2014 and union leaders from across the country \u2014 had arrived at the end of this block to celebrate the construction of Renaissance Village, a mixed-use complex that officials hope will spark a revitalization of this dying town. And more than that, they\u2019re pinning their hopes on it attracting more teachers to the McDowell County school system, whose ills are exacerbated by a revolving door of novice instructors and substitutes.\n\nSlated to be completed in the spring, the building will have 16 apartments and two floors of commercial and retail space. The $8.5 million project is being funded by the teachers union, tax credits and a capital campaign and is the first multistory building to be constructed in McDowell County in 50 years, according to the union.\n\nThe building represents the latest in the county\u2019s ambitious efforts to boost academic achievement by first tackling the effects of rural poverty \u2014 including a lack of suitable housing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBuilt into the verdant, tree-covered slopes of the Appalachian Mountains, this county was once among the nation\u2019s largest producers of coal. There was a strong middle class and a robust business district in downtown Welch. The decline of the coal industry devastated the county, with population losses accelerated by natural disasters, including a pair of ferocious floods that struck in 2001 and 2002. The arrival of opioids sparked another catastrophe.\n\nAt one point, McDowell County had the second-highest rate of deaths from prescription opioids, a number 13 times the national average. Fewer than a dozen counties in the nation have a lower life expectancy. This convergence of events has made McDowell the poorest county in what by some measures is the poorest state in the union, a distinction that residents have internalized.\n\nThe events that have befallen McDowell County \u2014 and its isolating geography \u2014 have created a constellation of challenges for schoolchildren: absent parents, overwhelmed grandparents, a dearth of medical care, a lack of grocery stores and all of the traumas associated with household poverty. More than 40 percent of elementary schoolchildren live in multigenerational households \u2014 with parents and grandparents \u2014 or are raised by grandparents and other relatives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe school system faces a daunting challenge: With so many having abandoned the county, how could it ensure its children were not left behind?\n\nThe shifts that have beset McDowell County are happening all over the country. With the growing recognition of the ways poverty can impede learning, schools are playing a larger role in meeting the basic needs of children: feeding them, clothing them and connecting them with medical care and counseling. There is evidence, too, that schools are educating a larger proportion of students from low-income households. The Southern Education Foundation, analyzing 2013 data, found that a majority of U.S. schoolchildren qualified for free and reduced-price meals, the first time that threshold had been breached in five decades.\n\nThe driving principle is that children who come to school hungry or traumatized or sick are not poised to succeed academically until those problems are addressed. McDowell County has taken this to heart, partly out of necessity and partly because other measures have failed. The state took over the schools in the early 2000s, handpicking administrators and superintendents with the hopes that new leadership could turn the district around. It did not, said Gayle Manchin, wife of Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who served on the West Virginia Board of Education from 2007 to 2015.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take much investigation . . . to see that the problems went a lot deeper than the superintendent and the classroom,\u201d said Manchin, who now serves on the board of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. So she contacted Weingarten, and together they hatched a plan to expand the county\u2019s existing efforts to tackle the roots and the symptoms of poverty through an alliance called Reconnecting McDowell. The apartment building is their crowning achievement.\n\nAnd so the McDowell County schools have tried to meet students\u2019 needs, large and small, from connecting them with psychologists to providing them with lip balm \u2014 an often-overlooked necessity for children who endure long waits for the school bus in cold weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve heard before that it takes a village to raise a child,\u201d said Shannon Pace, the coordinator of Communities in Schools, a dropout prevention initiative. As part of her job, she manages reams of donations and secures sneakers, undergarments, jackets, backpacks and yes, lip balm, for needy students. \u201cWe are rebuilding that proverbial village.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not able to access the learning part until we meet their basic needs,\u201d Welch Elementary School Principal Kristy East said of students. Nearly 70 percent of her students come from low-income families, according to state data, and many come with issues \u2014 trauma, depression, illnesses \u2014 that teachers felt ill-equipped to deal with. \u201cWe were realizing that it\u2019s more than what the school system can do,\u201d East said.\n\nAs she struggled to tackle absenteeism, East discovered that many children were missing a full day of school because they or their siblings had a dental or medical appointment. Because of a shortage of medical professionals in the impoverished county, many people have to drive an hour or more on the county\u2019s winding, two-lane roads to see a doctor or a dentist. For a family with one car, it meant that every child in that household would miss school.\n\nSo East brings as many health-care workers as she can to the school. Mental health providers from local clinics send psychologists and therapists to see young patients for appointments, converting empty classrooms into makeshift offices. It allows them to communicate directly with teachers about a child\u2019s progress.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne day in early September, a mobile dental team arrived before the first bell rang, turning a computer lab into a dentist\u2019s office. There, hygienists and a dentist inspected and cleaned teeth amid posters warning about the dangers of the Internet and encouraging students to \u201calways be polite\u201d online.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather do this than math,\u201d said Pace\u2019s son, Braxton, 8, before settling into the dental chair.\n\nEast aims to help her staff see the behavior of students through the lens of what the children might be experiencing outside the classroom \u2014 something that has transformed aspects of the school. This year, teachers learned how trauma at home \u2014 an unstable family, a shortage of food, a parent on drugs or in jail \u2014 can cause a child to act out.\n\nAD\n\nDiscipline at Welch Elementary now looks different. Children who break the rules are sent to Kimberley Newbill, a social worker whose official title is \u201cattitude and behavior coach.\u201d Newbill tries to determine the root of the misbehavior and help students develop coping mechanisms.\n\nAD\n\nAt lunchtime one day, a half-dozen students lingered in her classroom for detention. But rather than have them sit idly at desks, Newbill had them arrange themselves on mats. In this classroom, hundreds of miles from the nearest beach, at a school where many children scarcely leave the county, she switched on a relaxing guided meditation recording.\n\n\u201cListen to the seagulls. Listen to the water,\u201d Newbill told the students, who stood quietly, eyes closed. \u201cFocus on that.\u201d\n\nNot far from the groundbreaking, on a hill near Welch\u2019s downtown, 33-year-old Misty Stanley lives in a rowhouse painted bright green that sits atop a steep set of broken steps. For Stanley, the help from the county came even before her youngest daughter, Marabella, set foot in Welch Elementary.\n\nAD\n\nPace, the Communities in Schools coordinator, arrived at Stanley\u2019s home with the mission of ensuring Marabella would be ready for school when the day came. Working with the organization Parents to Teachers, she brought children\u2019s books and crafts, showing Stanley activities that would give Marabella a foundation to learn reading, math and writing. The goal is to close the gap in preparation between middle-class children and their impoverished peers. Research shows that by the time children in poverty enter kindergarten, they already lag behind other, better-off students.\n\nAD\n\nBut Stanley said Pace did more than prepare her children for school. She brought donated clothes and diapers when Stanley could not afford them. Stanley said Pace felt like her only friend as she battled drug addiction. Once, after a bad fight with her husband, she drove off with her two children \u2014 and landed on Pace\u2019s doorstep.\n\n\u201cI pretty much lost all hope, and it felt like there was nothing for me to pretty much live for,\u201d said Stanley, recalling the throes of drug addiction. \u201cShe helped me in more ways than I could even explain.\u201d\n\nNone of these things can help tackle an intractable problem facing McDowell County and rural school systems everywhere: a lack of teachers. At Mount View High School, which sits in adjacent buildings built on an abandoned strip mine, a fifth of teaching positions are vacant or filled by long-term substitutes who may be doing little more than babysitting students. The school has not had a full-time English teacher for ninth- and 10th-graders for three years, said Debra Hall, the high school principal.\n\nThis year, desperate for a qualified instructor, Hall started using a program called Proximity Learning. A certified teacher, working remotely, gives live lessons over Skype three days a week. The rest of the time, students work on their own and turn in their assignments virtually.\n\nFor Miranda Osborne, a top student in the senior class, the rotating cast of teachers and substitutes has proved frustrating. And she blames the high school\u2019s persistently low test scores on the teacher vacancy problem.\n\n\u201cWith the substitutes and all of that, it\u2019s hard for a kid to get immersed in it,\u201d Osborne said.\n\nThe vacancies have created other issues. Students have grown distrustful of new instructors, often asking upon their arrival: \u201cHow long are you going to stay?\u201d And the high school can\u2019t offer many electives. Osborne has already taken all of the classes offered at this campus. So this year, she\u2019s taking college classes online, an experience that can be isolating.\n\nHall knows the dearth of housing and the slow parade of businesses leaving has made it difficult to attract teachers. And she is skeptical a single building in downtown Welch will make much of a difference. The solutions in the meantime, she said, are far from ideal.", "description": "McDowell County is one of the poorest in the nation.
