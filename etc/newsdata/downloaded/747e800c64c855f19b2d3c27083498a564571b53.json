We shouldn't be losing lives over it.\"\n\nHow has Trump reacted to the ceasefire?\n\nMr Trump tweeted about the Turkish ceasefire before his vice-president unveiled it, writing: \"Millions of lives will be saved!\"\n\nHe added later: \"This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some \"tough\" love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!\"\n\nMr Pence credited Donald Trump's \"strong leadership\" during the announcement, saying: \"He wanted a ceasefire. He wanted to stop the violence.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump on Turkey ceasefire: \"It's a great day for civilisation\"\n\n\"I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path,\" Mr Trump added on Twitter.\n\nJust a day before the Pence-Erdogan meeting, it emerged that Mr Trump had sent his Turkish counterpart a letter about the offensive, urging him: \"Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!\"\n\nAfter the ceasefire announcement on Thursday, he called Mr Erdogan \"a hell of a leader\" who \"did the right thing\".\n\nWhat does Turkey say?\n\nTurkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told journalists the offensive would only be permanently halted when the SDF had left the border zone.\n\n\"We are suspending the operation, not halting it,\" he said. \"We will halt the operation only after [Kurdish forces] completely withdraw from the region.\"\n\nMr Cavusoglu said Turkey had also secured its goal of having heavy arms removed from the Kurdish-led fighters, and their positions destroyed.\n\nMr Pence said the US would lift economic sanctions imposed on Turkey when the military offensive ended, and would not impose more in the meantime.\n\nThe reversal on sanctions was been strongly criticised by the two most senior Democrats in the US Congress.\n\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer described Turkey's suspension of hostilities as a \"sham ceasefire\", saying President Erdogan had given up nothing. They said the lifting of sanctions seriously undermined the credibility of US foreign policy.\n\nSpeaking to Al Arabiya, senior Kurdish politician Aldar Xelil said he welcomed an end to the fighting, but that the SDF would defend itself if exposed to violence.\n\nJames Jeffrey, the US special representative on Syria, acknowledged that Kurdish-led forces weren't happy about leaving their positions.\n\n\"We're basically doing our best efforts to get the YPG to withdraw using as a carrot and a stick the sanctions levers that we have,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the YPG wishes that they could stay in these areas.\"", "description": "US Vice-President Mike Pence says the pause in operations will allow Kurdish-led forces to withdraw.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07rbfw8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
