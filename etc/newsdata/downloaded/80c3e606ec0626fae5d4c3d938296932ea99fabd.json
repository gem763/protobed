The settlement requires the owners of Purdue Pharma, members of the Sackler family, to pay R43 billion of their own fortune in cash over the next seven years.\n\n\"Purdue Pharma continues to work with all plaintiffs on reaching a comprehensive resolution to its opioid litigation that will deliver billions of dollars and vital opioid overdose rescue medicines to communities across the country impacted by the opioid crisis,\" the company said in a statement emailed to Business Insider.\n\nThe source of the family's wealth is OxyContin, the prescription painkiller that many say has fueled the US opioid crisis. Purdue Pharma has faced thousands of lawsuits over what accusers say is misleading marketing of OxyContin that contributed to opioid-related deaths.\n\nThe Sacklers are far from a tight-knit family. The Guardian described them in 2018 as \"a sprawling and now feuding transatlantic dynasty.\" According to a 2017 article from The New Yorker, there are 15 Sackler children in the generation following the founders of Purdue.\n\nWhile some Sacklers serve as board members of Purdue Pharma, others, notably those descended from the eldest brother, Arthur M. Sackler, who died before OxyContin was invented, have distanced themselves from the company and condemned the OxyContin-based wealth, according to The Guardian.\n\nHere's a look at the secretive and controversial family.\n\nThe Sackler family is one of the richest families in the US.\n\nIn 2016, Forbes estimated their net worth at a \"conservative\" R205 billion, beating out famously wealthy families such as the Mellons and the Rockefellers. More recent estimates put the figure at R190 billion. They own Purdue Pharma, a pharmaceutical company in Connecticut.\n\nThe vast majority of the Sackler fortune comes from a well-known prescription painkiller that Purdue Pharma launched in 1996, OxyContin.\n\nBy 2001, sales of the drug made up about 80% of Purdue Pharma's revenue.\n\nOxyContin is seen as partly to blame for the opioid crisis sweeping the US.\n\nMore than 130 people in the US die each day after overdosing on opioids, including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse.\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in July indicated that overdose deaths actually dropped 5% from 2017 to 2018, the first year-to-year decline since 1990.\n\nPurdue Pharma, which generates R43 billion in annual sales, has faced hundreds of lawsuits over what accusers say is misleading marketing about the risks of addiction when taking OxyContin.\n\nThe Sackler family still completely owns the company, and the multibillion-dollar fortune is shared among 20 or so family members. The family fortune has been estimated at R43 billion, but, as The New York Times reported, the exact number is unknown as Purdue Pharma is a private company.\n\nOn September 11, the New York Times reported that the owners of Purdue Pharma \u2014 including members of the Sackler family \u2014 reached a tentative settlement agreement.\n\nThe settlement requires the Sacklers to pay R43 billion of their own fortune in cash over the next seven years, The Times reported.\n\nOn September 15, The Washington Post reported that Purdue Pharma had filed for bankruptcy. The Chapter 11 filing came as part of a tentative settlement of more than 2,000 lawsuits against the pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe proposed settlement includes the Sackler family giving up ownership of the company and turning it into a for-profit \"public benefit trust\" that would provide R58 billion in drugs - some of which are used to save people from overdoses - to cities, counties, and states, according to NBC News.\n\nThe deal would also include R43 billion in cash from the Sackler family, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn a statement released on September 16, the Sackler family said:\n\n\"It is our hope the bankruptcy reorganization process that is now underway will end our ownership of Purdue and ensure its assets are dedicated for the public benefit ... We are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them.\"\n\nDespite the tentative settlement, Purdue Pharma continues to deny any wrongdoing. In a statement to Business Insider, the company said: \"While Purdue Pharma is prepared to defend itself vigorously in the opioid litigation, the company has made clear that it sees little good coming from years of wasteful litigation and appeals.\"\n\nThe company declined to comment on any further details of the proposed settlement to Business Insider.\n\nThe pharmaceutical empire began when the brothers Mortimer and Raymond Sackler took over a small pharmaceutical company in New York City's Greenwich Village called Purdue Frederick as cochairmen.\n\nIt later became Purdue Pharma.\n\nArthur, the oldest Sackler brother, worked in pharmaceutical marketing and became one of the world's leading collectors of Asian art.\n\nHe died in 1987 at age 73, before OxyContin was invented. His descendants split off from the rest of the family years ago and are \"mere multimillionaires,\" according to Esquire.\n\nArthur's four children, Elizabeth Sackler, Carol Master, Arthur Felix Sackler, and Denise Marica, have said they have not made any money from OxyContin.\n\nElizabeth, a board member of the Brooklyn Museum, where she endowed the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, has called the OxyContin-based wealth of her family members \"morally abhorrent\".\n\nA 2018 investigation by The Atlantic found a court document that showed a nearly $20 million payment to Arthur M. Sackler's estate in 1997 from the Purdue family of companies, suggesting his descendants did benefit in some way from OxyContin.\n\nIn an email to Business Insider, Janet Wootten, a spokeswoman for Jillian Sackler, widow of Arthur M. Sackler, denied that Jillian, Arthur, or their heirs have financially profited from the sale of OxyContin.\n\nMortimer Sackler, the middle son who was one of Purdue Pharma's chief executives, died in 2010 at age 93. He left behind his third wife, Theresa Sackler, and seven children, three of whom are board members of Purdue Pharma, according to The Guardian.\n\nTheresa is heavily involved in philanthropic work. In 2011, she received the Prince of Wales Medal for Art Philanthropy.\n\nOne of those board members is his son, also named Mortimer.\n\nThe other two are the daughters Kathe Sackler, who is also the founder and president of the Acorn Foundation for the Arts & Sciences, and Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, the director of the Sackler Lefcourt Center for Child Development.\n\nThe elder Mortimer's other four children \u2014 Samantha Sophia, Michael, Marissa, and Sophie \u2014 are apparently not involved in the company.\n\nMarissa Sackler, who considers herself a \"social entrepreneur,\" is the founder of Beespace, a nonprofit that supports organisations such as the Malala Fund.\n\nSophie Sackler is married to a British cricket player, with whom she lives in a $40 million house in London, according to The New Yorker.\n\nRaymond Sackler, Purdue Pharma's other former chief executive, died in 2017 at age 97. He had two children: Jonathan and Richard.\n\nBoth are board members at Purdue Pharma.\n\nRichard's son and Raymond's grandson, David, is also a board member.\n\nRichard Sackler reportedly lives in a six-bedroom home in Austin, Texas.\n\nThe home in the Westlake neighborhood of Austin comes with a pool and views of Lake Austin.\n\nHis son, David Sackler, paid cash for a R330 million home in Los Angeles in 2018, according to Curbed.\n\nThe estate in the Bel Air neighbourhood includes a tennis court and a pool.\n\nDavid is married to Joss Sackler, the founder of a private social club and clothing company for women.\n\nJoss is the founder of LBV, a private social club that costs R36,500 a year in dues to be a core member. The club also recently launched its own fashion line.\n\nRaymond's granddaughter, Madeleine Sackler, is an award-winning filmmaker.\n\nIn response to criticism related to her family background, she said she had \"never worked at the company or had any influence in it\".\n\n\"The Sacklers have hidden their connection to their product,\" Keith Humphreys, a psychiatry professor at Stanford University who has written extensively about the opioid crisis, told Esquire.\n\n\"They don't call it 'Sackler Pharma,'\" Humphreys said. \"They don't call their pills 'Sackler pills.' And when they're questioned, they say, 'Well, it's a privately held firm, we're a family, we like to keep our privacy, you understand.'\"\n\nBut the family is well-known for their philanthropic endeavors, with their names visibly emblazoned on hospital wings and museum galleries.\n\nIn a 2017 New Yorker article about the Sacklers titled \"The Family That Built an Empire of Pain,\" Patrick Radden Keefe noted the Sacklers were well-known for their philanthropy.\n\nThe Sacklers reportedly donated R50 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City in 1974 to create the Sackler Wing, where the Ancient Egyptian Temple of Dendur sits.\n\nOn May 15, 2019, however, the Met announced it would stop taking gifts from the Sacklers.\n\nMany other institutions including nonprofits, museums, and universities have recently cut ties with the Sackler family over the opioid crisis.\n\nThere's a Sackler Center at the Guggenheim in New York City, as well as a Sackler Educational Lab at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nSource: Esquire\n\nThe family's influence on art extends beyond New York City. There's a Sackler Gallery at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.\n\nAccording to Esquire, at Yale University, there's a Raymond and Beverly Sackler Institute for Biological, Physical and Engineering Sciences and a Richard Sackler and Jonathan Sackler Professorship of Internal Medicine.\n\nAnd in London, there's the Serpentine Sackler Gallery.\n\nThere's even a type of rose named after a Sackler.\n\nSome have suggested the Sacklers should instead put their money toward helping those affected by opioid addiction, The New Yorker's Patrick Radden Keefe reported.", "description": "Purdue Pharma just filed for bankruptcy.
