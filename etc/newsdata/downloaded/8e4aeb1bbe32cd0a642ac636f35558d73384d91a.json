More fuel to the fire.\u201d\n\nAfter the pep talk came a little admonishment for the beleaguered customers of this damaged franchise: \u201cDon\u2019t be a fan later.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be a fan later.\n\nWith that, Haskins becomes the latest Redskin to throw shade at a once-dedicated fan base that seems to have found something else to do on Sunday afternoons. Many have moved on, and some are not coming back.\n\nThose who remain can brush off the rookie\u2019s \u201cwarning\u201d as social media foolishness, or, in some cases, twist the logic enough to find something comforting and inspirational in the No. 1 pick\u2019s tone-deafness.\n\nHaskins\u2019 supporters (see ESPN\u2019s Louis Riddick, who appears to be lobbying Redskins owner Dan Snyder for Prince of Darkness Bruce Allen\u2019s job) will either chalk it up to a generational social media gap, or play it down as part of the growing process for a young quarterback.\n\nEveryone will miss the point.\n\nHaskins and his ill-considered tweet represent everything that is wrong with the Washington Redskins.\n\nEverything.\n\nThis is the Redskins culture, and it is the disease. It is what gets in the way of the football.\n\nAll the focus on who will play quarterback Sunday against the New England Patriots at Ghost Town Field \u2014 Haskins, Colt McCoy or a returning Case Keenum?\n\nNone of that matters. Culture does.\n\nQuarterback for this team? Brad Johnson, Jeff George, Patrick Ramsey, Danny Wuerffel, Mark Brunell, Jason Campbell, Rex Grossman, Robert Griffin III, Kirk Cousins, Alex Smith \u2014 you get the idea. Makes no difference. Culture makes the difference.\n\nThe obsession over whether Jay Gruden will be fired? After Norv Turner, Marty Schottenheimer, Steve Spurrier, Joe Gibbs, Jim Zorn, Mike Shanahan and now Gruden \u2014 who cares?\n\nNone of them could fix a poisonous culture in which a rookie is empowered before he ever steps foot at Redskins Park. A culture in which a player who\u2019s done nothing feels no qualms about tweaking a fan base that\u2019s been bleeding for decades. A culture that permits Josh Norman to do the same last week without consequence.\n\nCulture is the disease that allows Riddick to characterize Haskins as some sort of victim.\n\nRiddick claimed on the ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d that putting Haskins \u2014 the backup quarterback for the game \u2014 into the Giants contest suggests there was some anti-Haskins agenda by Gruden.\n\n\u201cDo you think Dwayne Haskins feels totally supported in this process?\u201d Riddick asked. \u201cThese are the kinds of things I talk about all the time, setting people up for success. That young man right now is being set up for failure. [Owner] Dan Snyder needs to recognize that.\u201d\n\nAll he left out was, \u2018Dan, here\u2019s my resume.\u2019\n\nIs it any wonder Haskins feels entitled?\n\nHe was the only player at the NFL combine who had a meeting with the Redskins owner. He was the only player who reportedly got the phone call the night of the draft saying he was a Redskin from Snyder, whose son, as we all know, was a classmate of Haskins\u2019 at the Bullis School.\n\nAnd he was the only rookie in this draft given a revered jersey \u2014 Joe Theismann\u2019s No. 7 \u2014 to wear before he ever took a snap for the organization. Snyder put the Redskins icon in the awkward position of making the decision on Haskins\u2019 request for No. 7, the number he wore in college.\n\nCulture was the disease when Robert Griffin III was told by Snyder to march into Shanahan\u2019s office and tell him he would no longer run the coach\u2019s offense. It was the disease when Snyder gave Griffin\u2019s family entry to the locker room, a privilege not granted to other families. It was the disease when Snyder gave Griffin use of his previous yacht for the quarterback\u2019s honeymoon.\n\nThe diagnosis of what ails this franchise isn\u2019t new. But the toll it takes on the organization \u2014 on the field, off the field and in the locker room \u2014 is always underestimated by those who think football actually matters at Redskins Park.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t \u2014 not when this disease strikes the latest savior of the franchise four games into his rookie season.\n\nEarlier in the week, Haskins\u2019 Twitter account reacted to the report from Fox college football analyst Joel Klatt on the Rich Eisen show that Redskins coaches didn\u2019t want to draft Haskins with the No. 15 pick, but the \u201cfront office\u201d \u2014 Snyder and Allen \u2014 did.\n\nThat\u2019s been reported by various outlets before, and it\u2019s true \u2014 there was a major disagreement between the coaches, player personnel staff and Snyder, who insisted that Haskins be selected with the 15th pick.\n\nWhen the latest report came out, the Haskins account replied, \u201cFake News.\u201d Not long after, that was deleted.\n\nThe disease remains immune to deletion.\n\nIt should be pointed out that we don\u2019t even know if Haskins operates his own social media. It could be a member of the firm of Haskins & Haskins. And the young man may have been as pure as the driven snow before he became a Washington Redskin.\n\nNow? He has quickly become the latest evidence of the disease that runs through the organization.\n\nWho is playing quarterback Sunday? Like that matters.\n\nJust make sure you\u2019re not a fan later. You\u2019ve been warned.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday and Sunday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
