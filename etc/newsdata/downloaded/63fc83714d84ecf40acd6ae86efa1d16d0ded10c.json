This year, however, satellite data from Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has shown an increase of almost 85 percent in fires across the country from 2018, mostly in the Amazon region. In 2019 alone, more than 80,000 fires have been recorded. By the time you read this many more trees will have burned to the ground.\n\nTo understand why this is happening, it\u2019s important to understand how Bolsonaro got to where he is, and with whose help. Back in 2016, as the country was in the throes of an economic and political crisis, Bolsonaro emerged as the voice of the far-right, the man who would, among other things, liberate farmers all over the country from the \u201cshackles\u201d of environmental legislation. In an effort to reduce red tape, one of his campaign promises was to fuse together the Agriculture and Environment Ministry. It didn\u2019t come to pass, but there was no doubt on which side he stood. \u201cLet it be clear, the future [Environment] minister will come from the production sector,\u201d he told a news conference on October 11. \u201cThere will be no more fighting [between environmentalists and farmers].\u201d\n\nSince winning the election, Bolsonaro has presided over a deforestation boom. Earlier this month, following the publication of the satellite images showing fires all over the Amazon, Bolsonaro sacked the man who released them: Ricardo Galv\u00e3o was let go from his post of director of the Institute for Space Research, after being accused by Bolsonaro of \u201cbetraying his country.\u201d\n\nWhen is it right to meddle in the affairs of a sovereign state? It is a question as old as diplomacy itself, but it becomes especially poignant when that state possesses one of the keys to the world\u2019s welfare. In the late 90s, French legal scholar and co-founder of Doctors Without Borders Bernard Kouchner came up with his \u201cright of interference\u201d theory, arguing that in cases of extreme humanitarian and environmental crises, states should have their sovereignty challenged. In the past decades, many have questioned Brazil\u2019s exclusive right to the Amazon. Today, Al Gore denies he ever offered a controversial and widely reported quote on his 1989 visit to Brazil while serving as U.S. Senator: \u201cContrary to what Brazilians think, the Amazon is not their property, it belongs to all of us.\u201d Whether the words were ever uttered or not, they echo a common sentiment, and one at which some Brazilians, including Bolsonaro and many figures in the military, bristle.\n\nThe Brazilian military is invested in protecting Brazil\u2019s sovereignty over the Amazon, and Bolsonaro so far has shown himself unresponsive to verbal pressure. He came into power promising to put more money in the pocket of ordinary Brazilians, while promising to do away with big government. The budget for Ibama, the environmental agency charged with protecting the rainforest, has been slashed by 25 percent. During the presidential campaign last year he said the following: \u201cIt\u2019s unsustainable for Brazil to have more than 50% of the [Amazon] territory allocated as indigenous lands, as environmental protection areas, as national parks, because it hinders development.\u201d", "description": "Raise the stakes for Brazil\u2019s president\u2014and work with the nation's people, not against them.", "authors": ["Felipe Araujo"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/96cc9e083fda1b6e3b59f66bf949b8ff45084f19.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
