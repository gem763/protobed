It can target genes in a specific location \u2014 for instance, to disrupt a mutation.\n\nAbout two-thirds of known human genetic variants associated with diseases are single point gene mutations, so gene editing has the potential to correct or reproduce such mutations.", "description": "", "authors": ["Cnn.Com Health Gene-Editing-Study-Intl-Hnk-Scli-Scn Index.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
