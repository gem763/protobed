In the months that followed, no action was taken against Halkbank for its alleged involvement in a massive scheme to evade sanctions on Iran. That changed when an undated indictment was unveiled Tuesday \u2014 a day after Trump imposed sanctions over Turkey\u2019s military operation in northern Syria.\n\nIt marked an unusual intervention by a president to get his top cabinet officials involved in an active federal investigation. It\u2019s not clear whether Trump instructed Barr and Mnuchin to satisfy Erdogan\u2019s pleas or whether the president was simply tired of being asked about it.", "description": "", "authors": ["Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
