We own a lot of XRP.\u201d\n\nHe outlined how Ripple manages its XRP token holdings, noting that the company had created 55 escrows, each containing 1 billion XRP that become unlocked once a month.\n\nOnce released, he said Ripple returns 80% of the XRP back into newly-created escrows for the future. He emphasized that while Ripple may own the escrows, they have cryptographic signage on their contracts, meaning that the firm can\u2019t open them at its behest.\n\nWith the remaining released XRP, Garlinghouse said Ripple either sells the tokens programmatically or over-the-counter (OTC) to institutional clients wanting exposure to XRP.\n\nNow that the market has become more liquid, however, he said these OTC sales are declining and Ripple often refers such clients elsewhere.\n\nOverall, Garlinghouse estimated that Ripple sells XRP at 10 basis points of daily market volume \u2014 i.e. 99.9% of XRP volume is not connected to Ripple.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the only example of crypto and blockchain being used at scale, period\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse also made the claim that Ripple is the \u201conly example of crypto and blockchain being used at scale, period.\u201d\n\nWhile he conceded that he was himself long on Bitcoin \u2014 \u201cit is working, it is scaled\u201d \u2014 he said that when it comes to blockchain enterprise solutions, Ripple is the only project out there that has passed experimentation and moved onto scaled implementation.\n\nIn a sign, perhaps, of the prevalence of Ripple-related controversies, Garlinghouse\u2019s discussion of the relation between Bitcoin and XRP circled back to another contentious issue.\n\nThe CEO noted that several former Bitcoin engineers, as well as Ripple founders, were involved in the creation of the XRP ledger, yet underscored that \u201cthe XRP ledger was created before the company Ripple existed.\u201d\n\nAs reported, community members have previously taken the company to task for ostensibly attempting to obfuscate the nature of its relationship to XRP.\n\nCory Johnson \u2014 a former Bloomberg TV anchor who worked roughly a year as Ripple\u2019s chief markets strategist \u2014 has come under fire recently for his controversial analogy that \u201cRipple\u2019s relationship to XRP is akin [to] Chevron\u2019s relationship to oil.\u201d\n\nGarlinghouse himself had previously used the analogy in an argument against yet another controversy: XRP\u2019s possible security classification.\n\n\u201cExxon owns a lot of oil,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make oil a security.\u201d", "description": "Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has argued that his company\u2019s transparency made it vulnerable to a \u201cbunch of misinformation.\u201d", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODNjZGQ1ZjE5YzgwMTFiZTRiODUyOTFiYzQ0YmRjMTkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
