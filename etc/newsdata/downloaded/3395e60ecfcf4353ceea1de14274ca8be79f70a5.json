(Allen Institute Photo)\n\nSeattle\u2019s Allen Institute for Brain Science is sharing 70 trillion bytes\u2019 worth of data documenting electrical activity in mouse brains, collected by a new type of silicon probe that can monitor hundreds of neurons simultaneously.\n\nThe Neuropixels system, developed by an international collaboration that includes the Allen Institute, could be adapted to record brain activity in human patients as well, said Josh Siegle, a senior scientist at the institute who works with the probes.\n\n\u201cThe application I\u2019m most interested in is decoding the communication patterns of the brain, and really understanding how information is transmitted between regions,\u201d Siegle told GeekWire. \u201cWhat are the transmission protocols?\u201d\n\nNeuropixels has already produced insights into the brain\u2019s inner workings, Siegle said. This week, the institute is due to publish findings on the BioRxiv preprint server that confirm hierarchical patterns of connectivity in the brain.\n\nThe key advance has to do with the hundreds of electrodes that are built into the brain-reading system\u2019s needle-like probes.\n\nEach of the six probes on the institute\u2019s system is about as thin as a human hair (70 microns) and measures less than a half-inch (10 millimeters) in length. But each probe contains 960 electrodes that can pick up electrical activity from networks of brain cells with sub-millisecond precision once they\u2019re implanted. Siegle said more than 370 readings can be recorded by each probe at any given time.\n\nA single Neuropixels probe consists of a needle-like shank (barely visible at lower right) that\u2019s connected to the system\u2019s electronics. The technology was developed at IMEC, an international nanoelectronics research center in Belgium, with the help of a team including the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Allen Institute for Brain Science, University College London, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and Wellcome.

The experiments focused on interconnections involving six regions of the visual cortex plus two other areas of the brain, the hippocampus and the thalamus.\n\nThanks to Neuropixels, researchers were able to monitor the symphony of electrical impulses that spread across the brain as the lab mice processed a variety of images and videos \u2014 including the opening scene of Orson Welles\u2019 1958 classic film, \u201cTouch of Evil.\u201d\n\nThe same visuals were used in earlier experiments to study visual processing. \u201cWe wanted to keep the stimuli as similar as possible to what was used in our imaging experiments, so we could try to make as direct as possible a comparison between the Neuropixel recordings and the imaging data,\u201d Siegle explained.\n\nEach experiment monitored the activity of thousands of neurons, adding up to a data set that documents how 100,000 brain cells behave. That\u2019s still just a small fraction of the 75 million neurons in the mouse brain, but it\u2019s a huge step forward from the neuron-by-neuron monitoring methods that have been used in the past.\n\n\u201cThere are a vast number of neurons in this data set whose activity has never been seen by a human eye,\u201d said Christof Koch, chief scientist and president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science. \u201cThese data are unprecedented \u2014 and we\u2019re releasing them publicly and in a standardized format to that anybody on the planet can use them for their own discovery.\u201d", "description": "Seattle's Allen Institute for Brain Science is sharing 70 trillion bytes' worth of data documenting electrical activity in mouse brains, collected by a new type of silicon probe that can monitor hundreds of neurons simultaneously.
