(AP) - The Jacksonville Jaguars have listed cornerback Jalen Ramsey as questionable to play Sunday against New Orleans.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone made the designation Friday, a day after owner Shad Khan said he expects the disgruntled defender to return following a two-week absence because of an apparent back injury.\n\nKhan told The Street he had a \u201cheart to heart\u201d with Ramsey earlier this week and \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to come to what makes sense for all.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if that means trading Ramsey or repairing his fractured relationship with the franchise.\n\nRamsey was limited in practice for a third consecutive day Friday. He saw a back specialist Monday in Houston.\n\nThe Jaguars (2-3) ruled out rookie tight end Josh Oliver, who has yet to make his NFL debut because of a significant hamstring injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Jacksonville Jaguars have listed cornerback Jalen Ramsey as questionable to play Sunday against New Orleans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/jaguars_ramsey_football_35062_c0-118-2829-1768_s1200x700.jpg?7a43dd0c8228d06f4c9111e17b7b3597113e4cb8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
