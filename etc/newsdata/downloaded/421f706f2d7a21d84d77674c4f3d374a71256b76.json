U.S. equity-index futures climbed, while Treasuries slipped with European bonds.\n\nAutomaker shares advanced and tourism companies declined in the Index, while Japanese stocks led increases in Asia. S&P 500 futures ticked higher after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell gave his last speech before a Sept. 18 policy meeting and cemented views for another interest-rate reduction. Euro-area bonds fell as investors showed less conviction that the European Central Bank\u2019s policy meeting Thursday will result in bold steps for more monetary stimulus. On Friday, the People\u2019s Bank of China said it will cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves to the lowest level since 2007, injecting liquidity into the economy as the trade war with the U.S. weighs on growth.\n\nCentral banks returned to the spotlight as protectionist moves by the world\u2019s two biggest economies cast shadows across the growth outlook elsewhere and more high-level Sino-U.S. talks are not expected until next month. Traders were kept somewhat on edge with data over the weekend showing China\u2019s exports unexpectedly contracted in August, and last week\u2019s U.S. employment report weaker than many forecast.\n\n\u201cThere has been a tremendous rally in bonds and the central banks are the key determinant of what\u2019s going to happen with the rates market,\u201d Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist for multi-asset investing at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told Bloomberg TV. \u201cWith equities there is still an element of self-determination.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, oil extended gains after Saudi Arabia ousted its energy minister before an OPEC+ committee that monitors compliance with output cuts meets this week in Abu Dhabi. The pound steadied as Boris Johnson held fast to his Brexit plan, despite the latest defection from his political party.\n\nHere are some key events coming up this week:\n\nThe U.K. Parliament may be suspended as soon as Monday, and a bill blocking a no-deal Brexit could become law.\n\nOPEC\u2019s monthly oil market report, which includes demand forecasts and production estimates, is due Wednesday.\n\nThe ECB policy meeting Thursday is widely expected to see a cut to interest rates and a review of all options, including QE. Policy makers will also publish forecasts for growth and inflation. ECB President Mario Draghi will hold a press conference.\n\nThese are the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.1% as of 9:33 a.m. London time.\n\nFutures on the S&P 500 Index rose 0.2%.\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 Index was little changed.\n\nThe MSCI Emerging Market Index climbed 0.2%.\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed.\n\nThe euro rose 0.1% to $1.1035.\n\nThe British pound edged up 0.1% to $1.2297.\n\nThe Japanese yen was little changed.\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries increased three basis points to 1.59%.\n\nBritain\u2019s 10-year yield gained four basis points to 0.542%.\n\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield rose four basis points to -0.60%.\n\nCommodities", "description": "Stocks Drift as Bonds Decline Amid Stimulus Bets: Markets Wrap", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic3357ade9df8dc6aa9a1f96bc2badc869.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
