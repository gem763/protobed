Johnson has always said he would not delay Brexit but would also abide by the law\u2014without explaining how he would achieve this.\n\nHe reiterated on Saturday: \u201cI will not negotiate a delay with the EU and neither does the law compel me to do so.\u201d\n\nHowever, later in the day the British government formally asked the European Union to delay the country\u2019s departure from the bloc, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nEarlier in the day politicians had gathered Saturday morning for a historic meeting in the House of Commons\u2014the first time they had assembled on a Saturday since Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands. It marked only the fourth Saturday they have met in 80 years.\n\nJohnson\u2019s plans have been frustrated by moves from opponents to try to delay the legislation again and send lawmakers home without voting on the deal in a move to derail Brexit.\n\nOliver Letwin, a former Conservative minister, tabled an amendment to delay agreeing on any deal until all the legislation needed to implement it has been passed through Parliament.\n\nThis was carried by 322 votes to 306, which means the politicians withheld approval of the prime minister\u2019s deal until the legislation to enact it is passed.\n\nThe motivation was to remove any possibility of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.\n\nIn the U.S., geopolitical concerns, including Brexit and trade, weighed on stock indexes on Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day Johnson had told Parliament: \u201cI do hope in assembling for the purposes of a meaningful vote that we will indeed be allowed to have a meaningful vote. I hope...that this is the moment when we can finally achieve that resolution and reconcile the instincts that compete within us.\u201d But it was not to be.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition, who said he would refuse to back the prime minister\u2019s withdrawal deal, had said he wants the people to have another say on Brexit.\n\nHe had told Parliament: \u201cVoting for a deal today won\u2019t end Brexit. It won\u2019t deliver certainty and the people should have the final say. I totally understand the frustration and the fatigue across the country and in this House. But we simply cannot vote for a deal that is even worse than the one this House rejected three times.\u201d\n\nOn a day of high drama, thousands of people marched through central London calling for another \u201cPeople\u2019s Vote\u201d to check that the U.K. is happy to leave the EU under the new withdrawal agreement.\n\nThey converged on Westminster as MPs debated the deal in the Commons. The march, which began at midday, started on Park Lane and was to end in Parliament Square.", "description": "", "authors": ["Rupert Steiner"], "top_image": "https://asset.barrons.com/public/resources/images/ON-DG949_Brexit_SOC_20191019093429.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
