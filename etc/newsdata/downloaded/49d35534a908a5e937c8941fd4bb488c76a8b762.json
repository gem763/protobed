It lost. That team eventually went to Minnesota. The expansion team that replaced it moved to Texas. More than three decades later, baseball returned, Montreal Expos disguised as something new. And until Tuesday night, beneath bistro lights hung across the outfield bleachers, before 43,976 people who stood with their jaws clenched, across generations and generations of on-and-off-again hardball stories, there had not been another World Series team here, not since 1933.\n\nFinally, the baseball soared toward center fielder Victor Robles, pitcher Daniel Hudson raised his arms, grown men poured from the dugout behind him, and this town shed its hard and raw memories that too often came with baseball. The Nationals were 7-4 winners. They had swept the St. Louis Cardinals in four games. They would play the winner of the American League Championship Series, the New York Yankees or Houston Astros, in a World Series that wouldn\u2019t begin for a week, and then host a World Series game here for the first time in too many scores to remember.\n\nThe Washington Nationals are headed to the World Series.

Strasburg laughed and accepted the invitation. The two interlaced their fingers and danced a waltz, beer spilling down their arms, a couple dozen teammates cheering them on. When the season started, Strasburg didn\u2019t dance and avoided hugs. In the middle of October, a teammate twirled him across the room.\n\nThey had been 19-31 in May. They had qualified for October as a wild card. They had stepped across the Milwaukee Brewers, the 106-win Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cardinals, and became the first team in franchise history \u2014 Expos and Nationals, beginning in 1969 \u2014 to win a league pennant.\n\n\u201cYou think about all the miles you drive,\u201d said Mike Rizzo, the old scout and decade-long general manager of the Nationals, \u201cand here you are.\u201d\n\nWhen the baseball fell into Robles\u2019 glove, almost three hours after they\u2019d put seven runs in the first inning on Cardinals starter Dakota Hudson, Hudson turned and heaved his glove in the direction of his oncoming teammates, a series-ending and hazily-manufactured tradition furthered by Sean Doolittle and him. He fell into the arms of catcher Yan Gomes. Nationals arrived from every direction. They\u2019d clung to those seven runs all night long \u2014 barely, it must be said, in a swervy eighth inning \u2014 and together took their first long breath since that first inning.\n\n\u201cThis is the best time of my career,\u201d said 36-year-old Howie Kendrick, who batted .333 in the series and was its Most Valuable Player. \u201cThe best moments of my career have happened here.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals had grown up. A decade ago they\u2019d lost 205 games across two seasons, bad baseball that netted them Strasburg and Bryce Harper. They got good, better anyway, and won four division titles in six years, seasons that in the end had them leaning on that one foot out the door. They lost in the division series all four times.\n\nIt all speaks to the miles they put in along the Anacostia River. Ryan Zimmerman through 15 seasons in their uniform, now 35 years old, a free agent soon, for one, sat in a soaked T-shirt and marveled at the footprints laid out behind him.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s sunk in yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMe, the fans, the community, we\u2019ve kind of grown-up together. I was 20 years old when I got here. We were not very good.\n\n\u201cThe way we grinded through that season and then obviously through this game, I kept telling them we\u2019ve got to keep going, keep going, keep going.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the only way the miles come, of course. With old savvy, with young legs, with a good amount of luck. With the occasional laugh, because what would be the point otherwise? They\u2019d cover some of that distance with horses \u2014 with Strasburg and Max Scherzer and, Tuesday night, Patrick Corbin. Their innings grooved a wobbly bullpen, when they themselves weren\u2019t the bullpen. They formed a line behind manager Davey Martinez, who\u2019d fought for his job in an unsightly 50 games to start the season, and near the end reminded him to remain calm, to breathe. Martinez had undergone a heart procedure a month ago, maybe because a season like this one generally requires the sacrifice of an organ or two. And they won. They won a lot. When they should have won, when they shouldn\u2019t have, when the old barriers of playoff series came, they won a lot.\n\nHowie Kendrick was named NLCS MVP. (Alex Trautwig/Getty Images)\n\nThirty minutes after the final out, with the stadium still red with fans, the infield filled with family members, and a stage overflowing with players and coaches, Martinez leaned into a microphone and said, \u201cThese guys back here, they cured my heart. My heart feels great right now.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered again.\n\nAs he\u2019d said earlier, \u201cOften bumpy roads lead to beautiful places. And this is a beautiful place.\u201d\n\nLater, when the ballpark had emptied and the last bottles were being emptied, in a quieter moment, Martinez was asked about those roads.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d he said, and his voice thinned at the emotion, at the exertion. \u201cThis, right here, to me, tops everything I\u2019ve ever been through. I mean, I\u2019m so proud of the guys, honestly. They could have folded. They didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd, also, \u201cI feel like a wet dog right now.\u201d\n\nHe laughed at the soaked clothes that clung to him and plucked at his shirt. This, perhaps, is what comes of the sturdiest souls. What happens when they stay. And fight. Bright light or darkness. Postseason curse or win a game and see what happens. Sure, dance, too. They wouldn\u2019t have known it was possible unless they\u2019d tried, unless they\u2019d won that game forever ago and found it was the first one that would put them here. Those miles weren\u2019t going to drive themselves.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to earn it, man,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cAll the things in the past, all the failures \u2026 it just makes it sweet because we\u2019re getting older\u201d \u2014 he nodded toward Zimmerman \u2014 \u201cand the game keeps getting younger.\u201d\n\nNow they\u2019re going to the World Series, all of them. With both feet in.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "These Washington Nationals will be remembered as much for what they aren\u2019t than for what they are, which are champions of the National League, pretty good too.", "authors": ["Tim Brown"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tWWTemNGNQh._qQ0Bxf8TA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTQuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RSMKlMuy.Atwfnz6KCKGmA--~B/aD0zMTQ2O3c9NDcxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7cacfa40-efde-11e9-bfda-99ef0514a378", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
