I am slightly disturbed by how this topic has been politicized. I am not going to debate global warming here, but let\u2019s at least agree that an excess of carbon dioxide (CO2) is unhealthy for you, me, and the environment.\n\nRoughly two-thirds of the electricity generated in the U.S. is currently sourced from fossil fuels. The positive news is that only half of that comes from coal; the other half comes from natural gas, which produces half as much CO2 as coal (though it has its own side effects \u2014 it leaks methane). Another 20% of U.S. energy comes from nuclear power, which produces zero carbon emissions. The remaining 17% comes from \u201cgreen\u201d sources, such as hydro (7%), wind (6.6%), and solar (1.7%).\n\nSo if tomorrow everyone in the U.S. switched to an electric vehicle (EV), and our electrical grid was able to handle it, we\u2019d instantly cut the nation\u2019s CO2 emissions by more than one-third.\n\nThe reason I am a big fan of the electric vehicle is that it offers consumers choices. Gasoline-powered cars run on oil \u2014 that\u2019s it; electric cars open the door to multiple forms of alternative energy. Such flexibility and choice means oil could cease to be the commodity that dictates geopolitics.\n\nAlternatives to fossil fuel have much less impact on the environment \u2014 and on you and me. Nuclear energy, for starters, is a no-brainer. Nuclear power plants have little environmental footprint \u2014 they spit out steam. But we have witnessed Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima. It is unclear how many people died in those disasters, because the death toll estimates range from a few dozen who died from direct exposure to thousands who died from cancer caused by radiation.\n\nYet if clearer minds had prevailed, we would not be on the fourth generation of nuclear reactors but the four-hundredth. Nuclear should be our core energy source: It is cheap; it produces little CO2; it provides stable, predictable output; and the latest versions are safe (self-cooling if there is loss of power).\n\nYet what I have learned in investing is that what I think should happen doesn\u2019t matter; only what will happen matters. Here is the good news: Nuclear production is expected to increase by almost 50% over the next 20 years, and 90% of the increase will come from the two most populous nations \u2014 China and India.\n\nSolar power is another option. Ten or 15 years ago, the thinking was that the solution to our energy problems would be lower prices for solar power. Indeed, the cost of solar has declined by 50% to 80% over the past decade, and this trend will likely continue. The problem is that we expect heat and air-conditioning to be available instantly, even on cloudy days. On those days, solar output drops, and if the wind doesn\u2019t blow, wind turbines don\u2019t turn. Then \u201cpeak\u201d coal- or gas-fed power plants come online to fill in the gap. Peak plants are smaller, usually less efficient power plants that produce more CO2 per kilowatt hour than larger plants.\n\nInstead of peak plants, we need peak batteries on sunny days to store extra electricity in battery packs. Interestingly, Tesla TSLA, +2.72% provided a 100-megawatt battery system to the state of South Australia for $66 million to help the region deal with a massive blackout in February 2017. It is unclear if Tesla made money on this transaction. However, it was reported that the battery saved the Australian state $17 million over six months by allowing it to sell extra power to the grid.\n\nRecently, Tesla announced the Megapack (a battery pack that looks like a shipping container), a large, utility-grade solution that has 60% greater power density than the battery used in South Australia. Thus, the billions of dollars poured into battery technology for EVs are also lowering the cost of peak batteries.\n\nBut here\u2019s the inconvenient truth about batteries and renewables in general: they are made of earthly materials that have to be mined, transported, refined, and turned into finished products, which are often nongreen alternatives.\n\nThere\u2019s another concern specific to lithium-ion batteries. They require cobalt, a mineral found in the Earth\u2019s crust. About half to 70% (depending on the source) of the world\u2019s cobalt reserves are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a politically unstable country with questionable labor practices. Both Tesla and Panasonic PCRFY, -1.27% 6752, -0.15% have been reducing the amount of cobalt used in their batteries; it has declined by 60% \u2014 the Tesla Model 3 battery, for example, contains just 2.8% cobalt. (By comparison, the Volkswagen ID.3\u2019s battery VW, +0.00% contains 12% to 14% cobalt.) Tesla and Panasonic recently announced that they are working on a cobalt-free battery; substituting silicon for cobalt.\n\nI now understand why Jeff Bezos believes in mining asteroids for minerals and is committed to spending his Amazon.com wealth on Blue Origin, his aerospace venture. And I see why Elon Musk wants his SpaceX to relocate earthlings to Mars. No matter what path we take in generating electricity, humans will still produce plenty of carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nOil is unwell\n\nNowadays 70% of oil production is used for transportation: the world produces about 80 million barrels a day globally, and about 60 million barrels go to cars, trucks, and airplanes. The rest goes for plastics, heating, and other uses. As EVs take market share from internal-combustion engine cars, demand for oil will decline.\n\nOil production requires a significant up-front investment, and so oil companies have a strong incentive to pump as much oil as they can for as long as they can, as long as their marginal extraction cost is below the price of oil. But supply exceeding demand will eventually lead to a collapse in oil prices.\n\nLow oil prices will lead to bankruptcies, which in turn will lead to decreases in the supply of oil. Oil prices will face further declines as EVs continue to take market share. (At some point, national governments will put phase-out deadlines on gasoline-powered vehicles, which will accelerate EV adoption.) Oil prices will decline again, and the vicious cycle will continue.\n\nRead more about how EVs will disrupt the auto industry, including whether Tesla and traditional automakers will survive in the long run, and who's right in the Tesla bull vs. bear debate.\n\nVitaliy Katsenelson is chief investment officer at Investment Management Associates in Denver, which has no positions in any of the companies mentioned.
