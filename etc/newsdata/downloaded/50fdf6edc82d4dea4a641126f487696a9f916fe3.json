For two months, John Heilpern followed the band around and spoke to their managers about \u2018the machinery, intrigues, finances and gimmicks,\u2019 all leading to the \u2018quest for the real prize - America\u2019.\n\nKit Lambert (brother of Terence Stamp) wanted to make a documentary about pop and went in search of bands to feature.\n\nLambert recalls seeing the High Numbers (as they were then) at the Railway Tavern, Harrow and Wealdstone. \u2018As soon as I saw them I felt a total conviction that this was it,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s as simple as that \u2013 this was it!

They got a lucky break, too, on Top of the Pops when another group pulled out and I Can\u2019t Explain climbed to number eight off the back of it. And then they released My Generation.\n\nBut it\u2019s the great myth of pop that you make it big overnight, explained Lambert \u2013 they went for broke in America, but it didn\u2019t work out.
