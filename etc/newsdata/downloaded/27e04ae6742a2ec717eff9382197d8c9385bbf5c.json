I can pay for transportation easily, and I may have a little bit more to save.\u201d\n\nBesides New York, workers in up to 21 other states and the District of Columbia will receive higher minimum wages next year, according to a National Employment Law Project report given exclusively to USA TODAY. About 17 million workers will benefit from the 2019 wage increases, the nonprofit estimates.\n\nMore: Based on African principles, Kwanzaa holiday holds lessons for entrepreneurs\n\nMore: Bad review?

Thirty-eight cities and counties also are scheduled to raise their minimum wages, according to the NELP report.
