(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nPresident Trump said Monday that he had reached a trade deal with Japan but provided no details of its terms, including whether he had agreed to rule out imposing tariffs on Japanese automobiles.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to report that my Administration has reached an initial trade agreement regarding tariff barriers ... with Japan and I intend to enter into the agreement in the coming weeks,\u201d the president said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nThe statement came less than a month after Trump announced an agreement \u201cin principle\u201d with Japan at the Group of 7 summit in Biarritz, France. The president told reporters it was \u201ca very big transaction\" that would be \u201ctremendous for the farmers.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Japanese officials did not confirm the agreement, saying instead that the two sides had a \u201cconvergence of views.\u201d\n\nTrump is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later this month at the annual United Nations General Assembly session. White House officials had been hopeful that they could announce major progress regarding the talks during the meeting with Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy.\n\nComing to terms with Japan is especially important because Trump withdrew from an earlier Pacific trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), on his fourth day in office.\n\nThe president castigated that agreement, which the Obama administration had concluded with 11 other nations, as disastrous for American manufacturing.\n\nBut leaving the TPP meant that American farmers in particular faced higher tariffs for their sales to Japan than U.S. trading partners.\n\nThroughout the year-long talks with the Trump administration, which Japan entered into reluctantly, Tokyo has resisted giving the United States better terms than it provided in the TPP.\n\nWhen those talks began last year, Robert E. Lighthizer, the chief U.S. negotiator, said there would be \u201can awful lot of differences between what was negotiated in TPP and the kind of agreement we expect with Japan.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s announcement of an agreement with the Japanese on Monday was contained in a just a few paragraphs, and it was issued under a provision of law that gives lawmakers no role in approving the deal, according to Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch.\n\n\u201cWhat this notice means is they have actually completed the details of what tariffs both countries will cut,\u201d she said.\n\nThe president said he also plans to reach an \u201cexecutive agreement\u201d regarding digital trade, a focus of industries from financial services to retail.\n\nThat accord will not require legislative approval and will probably resemble the provisions of other trade deals such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, according to William Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nTrump also repeated his intention to move on eventually to a second step in the negotiations with Japan, which he called \u201ca comprehensive trade agreement that results in more fair and reciprocal trade between the United States and Japan.\u201d\n\nOne of the president\u2019s central objectives in his \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade overhaul is narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. Last year, Americans spent $67 billion more on Japanese goods than Japan bought from American suppliers.\n\nTrump has often focused on the auto industry as a barometer of overall U.S.-Japan trade. Despite years of effort, U.S. automakers have struggled to gain ground in Japan. Ford Motor Co. withdrew from the market in 2016 after years of woeful results, which it blamed on Japanese trade barriers.\n\nMany analysts are skeptical that Japan\u2019s Abe, who faces opposition at home from politically powerful groups like farmers, will move on to a second deal.", "description": "The White House is rushing to show progress on Trump\u2019s trade approach ahead of the 2020 elections.", "authors": ["David J.
