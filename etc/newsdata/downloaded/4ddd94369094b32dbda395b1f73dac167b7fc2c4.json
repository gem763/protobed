REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\n\nNASA said earlier this year it was considering paying for two more seats to the space station for this fall and the spring of 2020 to ensure U.S. access.\n\nFour days after Musk and Bridenstine exchanged public criticism, Bridenstine said on Twitter that the two spoke by phone, which appeared to open the door for Thursday\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to visiting @SpaceX in Hawthorne next Thursday,\u201d Bridenstine said on Twitter. \u201cMore to come soon!\u201d", "description": "SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk opened up his private rocket factory to the top official of NASA on Thursday for a tour and progress report on the company's long-delayed Crew Dragon astronaut capsule.", "authors": ["Steve Gorman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439296209&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991FI", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
