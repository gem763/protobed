The 49ers host Cleveland on Monday night.\n\nThe Chiefs (4-1) had scored at least 26 points in 27 consecutive regular-season games, the longest streak in NFL history. But the run ended with a lackluster effort against the Colts (3-2), who dominated the line of scrimmage.\n\nMarlon Mack had 132 yards rushing, finding holes against a defense that lost tackles Chris Jones and Xavier Williams to injuries.\n\nThe Colts were equally impressive against reigning league MVP Patrick Mahomes. They spent most of the night in Kansas City\u2019s backfield, stuffing the ground game and putting constant pressure on Mahomes. He was sacked four times, hit more often, and spent the final few minutes hobbling around Arrowhead Stadium.\n\n\u201cWe got beat in about every phase you can get beat this evening,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.\n\nMahomes finished with 321 yards passing and a touchdown.\n\nThe Chiefs will try to regroup next week against Houston (3-2), which scored 53 points - the second-most in franchise history - in a victory against Atlanta (1-4).\n\nHere are some other things that happened during Week 5 of the NFL season:\n\nSTILL WINLESS\n\nFour teams remain without a victory: Cincinnati (0-5), Washington (0-5), Miami (0-4) and the New York Jets (0-4). At least one of them should snap out of their early season slump next week because the Dolphins host the Redskins.\n\nFor now, though, it\u2019s the NFL\u2019s most winless teams through Week 5 in a decade. Kansas City, St. Louis, Tampa Bay and Tennessee were winless after five weeks in 2009. Each of them ended its drought in the next three games.\n\nThe Bengals got the closest to winning Sunday, scoring two touchdowns in a little more than 2 minutes against Arizona and tying the game at 23. But rookie Kyler Murray drove the Cardinals into position for the game-winning field goal on the final play.\n\nCincy\u2019s problem was evident: It allowed 514 yards.\n\nWashington and the Jets were downright dismal on offense. The Redskins scored on their second possession against New England, getting a 65-yard run from receiver Cam Sims, but did little else . The Redskins finished with 220 yards and two turnovers.\n\nThe Jets would have loved that kind of outburst considering they managed 128 yards at Philadelphia.\n\nANOTHER INJURED QB\n\nPittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph left the game against Baltimore because of a concussion caused by safety Earl Thomas\u2019 hit to the chin.\n\nTrailing 17-13 in the third quarter, Rudolph scrambled to his left, stepped up the field and flicked the ball to teammate James Washington just before the crown of Thomas\u2019 helmet hit Rudolph under the chin. Rudolph limply fell to the ground and laid there with his eyes closed while medical personnel rushed to his side. Rudolph woozily made his way off the field and to a nearby hospital for further evaluation.\n\nHe was the second Steelers quarterback hurt this season. Starter Ben Roethlisberger is out for the year following elbow surgery.\n\nCarolina, Chicago, Jacksonville, New Orleans and the New York Jets also are without their starting quarterback because of injury.\n\nPATRIOTS ROLL\n\nTom Brady passed Brett Favre for third place on the NFL\u2019s all-time passing list with 71,923 yards. Brady now trails only retired Peyton Manning (71,940) and injured New Orleans star Drew Brees (74,845). Brady also edged closer to Manning\u2019s record 539 touchdown passes with the 527th of his 20-year career.\n\nNew England\u2019s defense has been even better than its 42-year-old icon.\n\nThe Pats are allowing 6.8 points a game, better than two defenses widely considered the best in NFL history.\n\nThe 1985 Chicago Bears allowed 12.4 points a game, and the 2000 Baltimore Ravens surrendered 10.3 points a game.\n\nNEWSY NUGGETS\n\nMahomes reached 7,000 yards passing in just the 22nd game of his NFL career, becoming the fastest player to reach that milestone in the Super Bowl era. He topped the previous mark by Hall of Famer Kurt Warner (25 games). \u2026 Dallas\u2019 Amari Cooper notched his third game with at least 200 yards receiving. Only Calvin Johnson (5) and Jerry Rice (4) have more in the Super Bowl era. \u2026 The Jets have more defensive/special teams touchdowns (3) than offensive touchdowns (2) this season. \u2026 Houston\u2019s Deshaun Watson posted a perfect passer rating (158.3) thanks to having the same number of passing touchdowns (5) as incompletions.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NFL is down to two unbeaten teams.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Long"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/07/colts_chiefs_football_62142_c0-182-4350-2718_s1770x1032.jpg?b82e59a5bf24c4143cde02a64f3a6e922188099c", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
