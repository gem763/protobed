It\u2019s a good result,\u201d he said.\n\nMercedes have already secured the constructors\u2019 title for the sixth year in a row, and are also sure of an unprecedented sixth successive championship double.\n\nMAX CLASH\n\nBoth Mercedes drivers lost out at the start, with Vettel squeezing out Hamilton, who had lined up third behind the two Ferraris but had to take avoiding action.\n\nFour-times champion Vettel apologised to Hamilton, saying he had not seen him in his mirrors and was trying to get into Leclerc\u2019s slipstream for a tow down the straight.\n\nHamilton tracked across the grass runoff, wrestling with the steering wheel to prevent a race-wrecking spin, and returned in fifth place with Bottas losing a place to seventh.\n\nAs Leclerc led Vettel away, Red Bull\u2019s British-born Thai rookie Alexander Albon made the most of the mayhem to catapult himself into third place.\n\nVerstappen, who was stripped of pole on Saturday after failing to slow for warning flags, dropped to the back after contact with Bottas left the 22-year-old limping back to the pits on a wheel rim after a right rear puncture.\n\nThe Dutchman, winner in Mexico for the past two years, carved his way back through the field to sixth at the chequered flag with Albon fifth.\n\n\u201cLewis was just cruising for most of the second stint up to the point where the pack was arriving, and then I guess he had enough tyres left,\u201d said Vettel of an afternoon on which he overruled the team on strategy and stayed out.\n\n\u201cIt was a good race, but here and there maybe with strategy we could have been a bit sharper.\u201d\n\nFormula One F1 - Mexican Grand Prix - Hermanos Rodriguez Circuit, Mexico City, Mexico - October 27, 2019 Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton in action during the race REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\nMexican Sergio Perez was seventh for Racing Point, to cheers from the sellout crowd.\n\nAustralian Daniel Ricciardo was eighth for Renault with Frenchman Pierre Gasly ninth for Toro Rosso and German driver Nico Hulkenberg taking the final point for Renault.\n\nRussian Daniil Kvyat finished ninth on the track but was handed a 10-second time penalty after colliding with Hulkenberg and sending him spinning into the wall.", "description": "Lewis Hamilton won the Mexican Grand Prix for Mercedes after a first-lap scare on Sunday but the Briton will have to wait another week to wrap up his sixth Formula One world championship.", "authors": ["Alan Baldwin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445619371&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0T4", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
