Police are expected to recommend further charges against individuals and companies over the course of the probe, investigators have told the Journal.\n\nA spokeswoman for T\u00dcV S\u00dcD said the company wouldn\u2019t comment on the case, other than to say the group has cooperated fully with the authorities in the investigation. A spokeswoman for Vale declined to comment.\n\nVale has said it had no knowledge of any imminent risk at the dam, and has cooperated fully with authorities.\n\nSince the dam\u2019s collapse, authorities have narrowed in on safety audits carried out by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD in June and September last year, which concluded the dam at Brumadinho was stable. Vale used those certificates to prove the dam\u2019s stability to regulatory bodies in Brazil.\n\nAn investigation by the Journal in February found that employees of both Vale and T\u00dcV S\u00dcD knew for months of dangerous conditions at the mine-waste dam before it collapsed. Yet inspectors certified the dam as safe, expressing worry about losing contracts with Vale, the dam\u2019s owner and a major client.\n\nIn police testimony seen by the Journal, Makoto Namba, a senior engineering inspector at T\u00dcV S\u00dcD, told police he felt pressured by a Vale official to sign the dam\u2019s safety certification. T\u00dcV S\u00dcD had contracts for safety audits at tens of other Vale dams in Brazil, as well as new projects at the dam in Brumadinho. Mr. Namba\u2019s lawyer said he would only comment once the accusations were made public.\n\nIn May, an investigation by the Journal also found that several of Vale\u2019s own workers at the mine warned their bosses the dam was about to collapse. Supervisors brushed aside those concerns, in some cases citing fears about extra expenditures.\n\nThe crime of false representation, which can carry a prison sentence of up to six years in Brazil when related to some cases of environmental damage, may also serve as the basis for other charges, investigators have previously told the Journal.\n\nIf a judge finds T\u00dcV S\u00dcD\u2019s certificates were issued fraudulently, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD could be found guilty of corruption, given that the certificates were submitted to government regulators and other authorities as proof of the dam\u2019s stability, officials told the Journal earlier this year.\n\nUnder Brazil\u2019s 2013 anticorruption law, companies are considered guilty of corruption if they obstruct the activities of a regulator or other government authority. If found guilty, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD could face penalties ranging from hefty fines to the partial or total closure of its operations in Brazil, as well as possible scrutiny by prosecutors in Germany, legal experts said. The company employs about 500 people in Brazil, where it owns a laboratory as well as the engineering business that was tasked with auditing Vale\u2019s mine, which it acquired in 2013, according to its website.\n\nFounded in 1866, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD has built a reputation as one of the world\u2019s best-known inspection and certification groups. With a slogan \u201cAdd Value. Inspire Trust,\u201d the Munich-based group now employs about 24,000 people and is responsible for accrediting a range of items, including planes and health products.\n\nWrite to Luciana Magalhaes at Luciana.Magalhaes@wsj.com and Samantha Pearson at samantha.pearson@wsj.com", "description": "Brazilian police are set to announce the first criminal charges against employees of mining giant Vale and German safety inspector T\u00dcV S\u00dcD over the deadly collapse of a mine-waste dam in January.", "authors": ["Luciana Magalhaes", "Samantha Pearson", "Luciana.Magalhaes Wsj.Com", "Samantha.Pearson Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108057/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
