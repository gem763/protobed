He said he does not abuse drugs or alcohol and says he even submitted to random drug testing to prove it.\n\nRenner also, according to TMZ, hit back at a disturbing allegation he says his ex is making - that he sexually and physically abused Ava.\n\nHe says she used to brag to friends about 'bagging an Avenger' and that she plans her attacks on him to coincide with the release of his movies so that she gets the publicity.

But you cannot hide Pacheco.\n\nThe documents were obtained by TMZ on Monday.\n\nIn them, she claims Renner told a friend at a nightclub last November that he wanted to get rid of his ex-wife.\n\nHe said, she claims, that he 'could not deal with her anymore, and he just wanted her gone.'\n\nOn another occasion, he 'put a gun in his mouth, threatened to kill himself, and fired the gun into the ceiling while Ava was asleep in her bedroom.'\n\nPacheco also alleges that he abuses drugs and that he once left cocaine out on a bathroom counter in the house within their daughter's reach.\n\nShe also accused him of having a revolving door of women at the house, saying her daughter had referred to 'Tayler, Kelley, Natalie, Summer, Faith, Christina, Naz and Jessica' as visitors.\n\nPacheco said he also once claimed Ava would be better with 'no parents' than with her as a mother.\n\nRepresentatives for Renner, 48, did not immediately respond to DailyMail.com's inquiries on Monday morning.\n\nHowever one told TMZ: 'The well-being of his daughter Ava has always been and continues to be the primary focus for Jeremy.\n\n'This is a matter for the court to decide. It's important to note the dramatizations made in Sonni's declaration are a one-sided account made with a specific goal in mind.'\n\nIn text messages that she previously submitted to the court, she accused him of taking her passport hostage and also stealing their daughter's so she could not go on a family trip.\n\nRenner and Pacheco married in 2014, a year after Ava was born. They separated the same year.\n\nLast year they reached a new agreement on child support to last through 2020.\n\nThe star was originally paying $13,000 a month, but now if his yearly income exceeds $2.3 million, five percent will go to his ex.\n\nUnder the agreement, his payments to Pacheco will never exceed $200,000 per year.\n\nAny excess will go into an account for their daughter.\n\nWith funds initially going towards her education, any money left over will be hers to use freely once she turns 27.\n\nRenner told Playboy in 2015 that his time with his daughter is when he is happiest.\n\n'When it's Daddy and Ava time, that's all I do,' Jeremy gushed.\n\n'You're talking to a guy who's really happy in his f***ing flip-flops right now with his little daughter in her pajamas running around in the house, waiting for me.'", "description": "The actor and his ex-wife Sonni Pacheco are fighting over custody of their six-year-old daughter, Ava.
