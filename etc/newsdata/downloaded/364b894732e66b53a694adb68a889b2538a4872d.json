However, according to the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d of individual expectations, five members thought the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should have held its previous range of 2.00% to 2.25%, five approved of the 25 basis point cut but keeping rates there through the rest of the year, and seven favored at least one more cut this year.\n\nThe FOMC again cited \u201cthe implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures\u201d as the primary rationale for Wednesday\u2019s cut.\n\nAt 19:14 GMT, December Comex gold futures are trading $1497.10, down $16.30 or -1.08%.\n\nDaily December Comex Gold More\n\nDaily Technical Analysis\n\nThe main trend is down according to the daily swing chart. A trade through $1566.20 will change the main trend to up. The next main bottom target is $1412.10, but sellers are going to have to take out a key retracement zone before the market gets there.\n\nThe short-term range is $1566.20 to $1490.70. Its retracement zone at $1528.50 to $1537.40 is resistance.\n\nThe main range is $1412.10 to $1566.20. Its retracement zone at $1489.10 to $1471.00 is the next downside target. Trader reaction to this zone will determine the near-term direction of the market.\n\nDaily Technical Forecast\n\nBased on the early price action and the current price at $1497.10, the direction of the December Comex gold market into the extended close is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the main 50% level at $1489.10.\n\nBearish Scenario\n\nA sustained move under $1489.10 will indicate the presence of sellers. Crossing to the weak side of the downtrending Gann angle at $1486.20 will indicate the selling is getting stronger with additional targets an uptrending Gann angle at $1478.10, followed by a Fibonacci level at $1471.00.\n\nBullish Scenario\n\nHolding the main 50% level at $1480.10 will indicate that buyers are coming in to support the market. If this creates enough upside momentum then look for the rally to possibly extend into the uptrending Gann angle at $1506.40. Overcoming this angle will indicate the buying is getting stronger with the next target angle dropping in at $1526.20.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "Based on the early price action and the current price at $1497.10, the direction of the December Comex gold market into the extended close is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the main 50% level at $1489.10.", "authors": ["James Hyerczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MwTCgAtqamWbg6uuaEL1XA--~B/aD00MDI7dz04MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/fx_empire_176/2b54ddb6b0e9fbb6c7dc4f6c9de765eb", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
