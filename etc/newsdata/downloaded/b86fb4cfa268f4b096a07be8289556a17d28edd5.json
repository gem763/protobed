Constitutionally, I don't want the things I look forward to spoiled.\n\n'If there's a movie I'm looking forward to, I don't want to know jack squat about it before I'm sitting down in the theatres and the lights go down.'\n\nOne aspect that plagued them was how to get Bryan into the state stealthily, given he had an eight-night-a-week performance schedule for Network in New York.\n\nWith only Monday night off, they planned to fly the actor over on the Sunday after his play, film the next day and in the morning on Tuesday so he could return to the Big Apple in time to make his performance that night.\n\nSecretive: To avoid leaks and get Bryan into the state stealthily, given his eight-night-a-week performance schedule for Network in New York, they flew him in a loaned a private jet\n\nWorried that the plane would be delayed or someone would see him travelling on a chartered flight and figure out why he was there, the producers decided to sneak Bryan out in a loaned private jet.\n\nBut that wasn't all producers were concerned about, as Bryan had a full head of hair, but couldn't shave it off because of his commitments to his Broadway play, but they also felt it would give the game away if he did go bald.\n\nRecreating Walt's iconic look with a bald cap, despite being described as the 'greatest of all time', was quickly dismissed as the silhouette was off, so instead they decided to fix it digitally in post-production.\n\nThe flashback scene between Walt and his former-student-turned-partner Jesse Pinkman (Aaron) takes place in a diner in town, so to avoid anyone seeing the pair together they surrounded the building with screens and cars.\n\nImpressive drama: El Camino follows Jesse, now a fugitive from the law, as he tries to put himself back together after being kidnapped by an Aryan Brotherhood gang and escaping\n\nOne distinct vehicle used was Walt and Jesse's classic RV, which they parked outside the diner and told curious passersby was a replica used by the business to give Breaking Bad-themed tours - a lie people easily believed.\n\nAnd luckily, despite the drama, Bryan's involvement was successfully kept under wraps, giving fans a wonderful surprise when they had the chance to finally watch the film.\n\nEl Camino follows Jesse, now a fugitive from the law, as he tries to put himself back together after being kidnapped by an Aryan Brotherhood gang and escaping with his life following their clash with Walter White.\n\nDiscussing his return with Rolling Stone, Bryan said: 'It was wonderful. I was really grateful that he thought of me to be a part of this.\n\nDelighted: Discussing his return with Rolling Stone, Bryan (pictured with Aaron at the film's LA premiere) said: 'It was wonderful. I was really grateful that he thought of me to be a part of this'\n\n'At the same time, I was wondering, \u201cHow the hell is that going to work?\u201d I guessed it only could be retrospective, in flashback, and said, \u201cOK, whatever he has to do.\u201d And basically, that\u2019s it.\n\n'If Vince Gilligan called me and said, \u201cI need you to wash my car,\u201d I\u2019d say, \u201cHow about this Saturday?\u201d I would do anything for him, because I know he is so devoted to the integrity of the characters.'\n\nThe Isle Of Dogs star added that he wouldn't have returned had Vince decided to do 'two or three more years' of the show because it had the 'perfect' ending.\n\nEl Camino is out now in select cinemas and on Netflix.", "description": "The sequel film to Breaking Bad was released on Friday last week, after being shot in complete secrecy in Albuquerque, New Mexico.", "authors": ["Roxy Simons For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/08/19729352-0-image-a-23_1571126291444.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
