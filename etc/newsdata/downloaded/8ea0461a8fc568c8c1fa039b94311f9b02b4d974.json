(TSE:WBR) For Its Upcoming 0.8% Dividend", "language": "en", "text": "Readers hoping to buy Waterloo Brewing Ltd. (TSE:WBR) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. Ex-dividend means that investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of October will not receive this dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of October.\n\nWaterloo Brewing's next dividend payment will be CA$0.03 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed CA$0.1 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Waterloo Brewing stock has a trailing yield of around 3.1% on the current share price of CA$3.25. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Waterloo Brewing's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Waterloo Brewing has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Waterloo Brewing\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Waterloo Brewing is paying out an acceptable 62% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. The company paid out 99% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Companies usually need cash more than they need earnings - expenses don't pay themselves - so it's not great to see it paying out so much of its cash flow.\n\nWhile Waterloo Brewing's dividends were covered by the company's reported profits, cash is somewhat more important, so it's not great to see that the company didn't generate enough cash to pay its dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were Waterloo Brewing to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nTSX:WBR Historical Dividend Yield, October 10th 2019 More\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Waterloo Brewing's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 35% per annum for the past five years. Earnings have been growing quickly, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the past four years, Waterloo Brewing has increased its dividend at approximately 20% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nHas Waterloo Brewing got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? It's good to see that earnings per share are growing and that the company's payout ratio is within a normal range for most businesses. However we're somewhat concerned that it paid out 99% of its cashflow, which is uncomfortably high. In summary, it's hard to get excited about Waterloo Brewing from a dividend perspective.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Readers hoping to buy Waterloo Brewing Ltd.
