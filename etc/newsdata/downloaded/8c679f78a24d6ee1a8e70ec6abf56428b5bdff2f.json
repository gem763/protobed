Still inside - more details to come,\" tweeted congressman Matt Gaetz, a fierce Trump defender.\n\nThe House Homeland Security Committee chairman, Bennie Thompson, wrote the sergeant at arms complaining that lawmakers blatantly breached security by \"intentionally\" bringing their electronic devices into the SCIF.\n\n- 'Freaked out' -\n\n\"As such I am requesting you take action with respect to the members involved in the breach,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nThe sit-in delayed the deposition of Laura Cooper, a deputy assistant secretary of defense responsible for Ukraine policy, for several hours.\n\nCooper began testifying later in the afternoon, a staffer told AFP.\n\nThe House's number two Republican, Steve Scalise, joined the protest, saying lawmakers were being denied access as Democrats were \"trying to impeach the president of the United States with a one-sided set of rules.\"\n\nAll members of the three House committees conducting the investigation, including more than 40 House Republicans -- among them Vice President Mike Pence's brother, congressman Greg Pence -- are permitted to attend the depositions and question witnesses.\n\nSeveral of those with full access to the hearing actually joined other Republicans in the protest, arguing that the impeachment process deserves more transparency\n\nRepublicans opposed to the impeachment process have settled on the new strategy of attacking the process itself, claiming it is invalid because the House has not taken a floor vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, and that it lacks transparency.\n\nTaylor delivered a withering deposition Tuesday that some Democrats have described as the most damning testimony yet.\n\nNumber two Senate Republican John Thune acknowledged that the picture painted by the envoy according to reports was \"not a good one.\"\n\nIn a 15-page opening statement to lawmakers, Taylor provided extensive details of how Trump sought to withhold US military aid to exert pressure on his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, to launch an investigation of his political rival Joe Biden and his son.\n\nTaylor said in his statement that the US ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told him that \"'everything' was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.\"\n\n\"Bill Taylor gave a devastating opening statement yesterday, they're freaked out, (and) they're trying to stop this investigation,\" Democratic congressman Ted Lieu told reporters.", "description": "US congressional Republicans furious about being left out of the Donald Trump impeachment process stormed a closed-door witness deposition Wednesday and refused to leave for several hours, escalating a showdown over the investigation of the president.
