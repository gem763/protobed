Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), a longtime opponent of the voucher program, which provides low-income families money to attend private schools.\n\nAD\n\nWalden Ford \u2014 played by \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d star Uzo Aduba \u2014 and the filmmakers insist this is a human tale, not a political one. But the independent movie\u2019s debut this month comes as the Trump administration is pushing for an expansion of vouchers and as Democratic presidential candidates debate school choice.\n\nAD\n\nThe film\u2019s production company, Moving Picture Institute, has the financial backing of the Mercer Family Foundation, a powerhouse donor to Republicans, according to foundation tax filings. Tax records also show that Rebekah Mercer, listed as director of the family foundation, previously served on the production company\u2019s board. The president of the production company, Rob Pfaltzgraff, said in a statement that donors, including the Mercer Family Foundation, did not have influence over the content of the film.\n\n\u201cThis is not political,\u201d Walden Ford said in an interview. \u201cWhen we were marching in the halls of Congress, the only policy we thought about is how we can get better options for our kids.\u201d\n\nWhen the movie begins in 2003, Walden Ford\u2019s youngest son is struggling in a neighborhood public high school, where violence is rampant and learning is limited. The single mother fears for her son and wants to enroll him in a private school that she cannot afford. As she struggles to scrape together money for tuition while her son becomes more disengaged from school and drawn to the streets,she learns of a voucher programs that exists in other jurisdictions. She rallies residents to champion the program in the District.\n\nWhen the congresswoman declines to support her efforts, Walden Ford and other parents team up with a white lawmaker not from D.C. who succeeds in pushing through the legislation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am thrilled this bill will create a scholarship fund so low-income parents like Virginia can send their kids to school so they can break free from the shackles of poverty,\u201d the fictitious congressman, Cliff Williams, says at a news conference in the film announcing passage of the bill.\n\nCritics have said in the past that the initiative is problematic because most students using vouchers in the District attend religious schools. Many D.C. students with vouchers go to schools where nearly all students are voucher recipients, and some are enrolled in campuses that are not accredited, according to a 2012 Washington Post analysis.\n\nA 2017 U.S. Education Department study found that D.C. voucher students performed worse on standardized tests within a year after entering private schools than peers who did not participate. But a federal study also found that parents who use vouchers are more likely to perceive their child\u2019s school as \u201cvery safe\u201d and that graduation rates were higher among recipients.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMore than a dozen states have voucher programs, but the District is unique because Congress can enact a voucher program even if local lawmakers do not want it. The city is home to the nation\u2019s only federally funded voucher program, the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Act, which sends more than 1,000 students to private schools.\n\nFormer House speaker John A. Boehner was a major booster of D.C.\u2019s voucher program, citing his scholarship to attend a Catholic high school as a life-changing opportunity. The voucher program is now tied to federal funding for D.C.\u2019s public schools. In 2017, a majority of the D.C. Council asked Congress to phase out the voucher program.\n\nNorton declined to comment on the film because she had not seen it.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNorton is disappointed that the bill allows new students to enroll in the private school voucher program Congress imposed on the District, but is pleased the bill requires the participating private schools to comply with federal civil rights laws,\u201d Norton wrote in a June statement about the program. \u201cThe program has failed to improve academic achievement, as measured by math and reading test scores.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nR.J. Daniel Hanna, the film\u2019s director, said Walden Ford\u2019s story drew him to the movie \u2014 not the subject of vouchers. The movie is about a woman who started a movement, he said, an inspiring tale about the power of parents to advocate for their children. Hanna said he focused on parents and did not devote significant time to the arguments against vouchers or interview Norton and other local politicians for the film.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to tell a really great human story about one woman who sparked change,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cIt really is about keeping it to the human story, about a mother and a son.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiss Virginia\u201d filmed for four days in D.C., getting background shots of rowhouses, streets and Capitol Hill.\n\nWalden Ford said the film was true to her story and to the struggles and disappointment she faced as she searched for an adequate education for her son.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey approached me with the concept, and I thought it was a way to honor the legislative fight,\u201d Walden Ford said. \u201cThis is a story that belongs to parents all over the country.\u201d\n\nAfter Congress approved the voucher program, Walden Ford continued advocating for expanded school choice in the District through the group she founded, D.C. Parents for School Choice. She is a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative public policy think tank where she has written about her fight for vouchers. She now lives part-time in her home state of Arkansas, where she continues fighting for school choice.\n\nWalden Ford said her son\u2019s story shows how effective vouchers can be. He graduated from Archbishop Carroll High School in the District and served in the military. He works for UPS and recently purchased his first home in the Washington area.\n\n\u201cMiss Virginia\u201d is scheduled to be released Friday and will show in about a dozen theaters across the country. It will also be available on iTunes and video on demand.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cMiss Virginia\u201d tells the story of a mother who fought to get her son into a private school.", "authors": ["Perry Stein", "Reporter Covering D.C.
