He faces a minimum of 47 years in prison. If his cooperation is successful, prosecutors agreed earlier this year to lobby for a lighter sentence.\n\nHis utility as an informant has an inevitable expiration date. Mr. Ellison\u2019s and Mr. Mack\u2019s trial is expected to conclude within days, and it is unclear whether Mr. Hernandez would testify in any other potential trials that could stem from the government\u2019s case against Nine Trey.\n\nProsecutors have indicated he could enter the witness protection program.\n\nSuch a path would not be unprecedented.
