Beyond that starting three, Klopp could call upon any of James Milner, Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana and Xherdan Shaqiri if required from the bench, while Naby Keita is not far away from a return after injury.\n\nCritics of Liverpool have often pointed to that midfield area as homogenised, with a group stylistically too similar to each other and too workmanlike. But that is simply not true \u2013 Liverpool possess a deep and varied midfield corps, all of whom work hard to engage Klopp\u2019s press, enabling rotation without compromising the unit\u2019s strength.\n\n2. Firmino\u2019s introduction key in turning the pattern of the game\n\nRoberto Fimino\u2019s importance to Liverpool was again spotlighted this afternoon, with the Brazilian\u2019s introduction changing the pattern of the game.\n\nWhile Liverpool had equalised ten minutes before Firmino\u2019s arrival, Newcastle\u2019s five-man defence looked, on the whole, relatively comfortable.\n\nWhen Divock Origi limped off and Firmino came on, though, the Brazilian immediately asked different questions and created indecision. Dropping deep, the three Newcastle centre-halves were unsure of whether to step out with Firmino, and, if so, which of them should go with him.\n\nIt was from such a situation that Sadio Mane\u2019s second goal came. Firmino dropped deep and won the ball in a good area, turning to find the Newcastle defence fragmented and out of alignment, with Mane and Mohamed Salah both making their favourite diagonal, incisive runs into the spaces created.\n\nThough his pass was a touch overhit, Mane forced a fumble from Martin Dubravka and capitalised on the goalkeeper\u2019s mishandle and put Liverpool ahead.\n\nAnd then there was the trickery on the edge of the are to tee up Salah for the third, a joyful expression of footballing creativity executed to perfection, finding a modicum of space when there seemed to be none and turning the ball quite brilliantly into the Egyptian\u2019s pass. Naughty.\n\n3. Are Newcastle really that bad?\n\nThis is a question that had been tentatively put forward after Newcastle\u2019s surprise victory at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium, and after giving Liveprool a scare, it is fair to ask it again.\n\nWhen Steve Bruce arrived at Newcastle they were widely written off, declared relegation favourites and pointed to as an example of a dysfunctional Premier League club, particularly after letting key attacking influencers go in Salomon Rondon and Ayoze Perez.\n\nBut a scan of today\u2019s team sheet shows an underlying quality, and reveals the strength of the squad with which Bruce has to work. Jamaal Lascelles and Fabian Schar are two of the better centre-backs outside of the top six, while 22-time Dutch international Jetro Willems showed his quality with a magnificent turn inside and finish into the top corner. Emil Krafth has similar international experience with Sweden.\n\nFurther forward, Joelinton and Miguel Almiron were both expensively procured (though both have more to prove), while Christian Atsu\u2019s obvious abilities saw him bounce around the Chelsea loan system for longer than most.\n\nConsider, then, that this side was selected from a squad ravaged by injury \u2013 Andy Carroll, Sean Longstaff and exciting summer signing Allan Saint-Maximin are among seven or so first team players out. Perhaps we underestimated the quality of this Newcastle team, and their promising start to the season should come as less of a surprise.\n\n4. Magnificent Mane becoming Liverpool\u2019s most consistent attacker\n\nTwo more Liverpool goals for Sadio Mane, and the Senegalese attacker is beginning to move towards another level. It is easy to forget that Mane may only just be coming into his prime.\n\nMane is becoming the most consistent of Liverpool\u2019s front three, ever a threat as a runner, passer or scorer. He is timing his movements expertly; few players in the division recognise space more effectively, or appreciate how to exploit it.\n\nSince the beginning of last season, Mane is the only player to have scored 25 or more Premier League goals without scoring a single penalty. He is an instinctive, prolific goal scorer and hugely important to the Liverpool side.\n\n5. Liverpool\u2019s refusal to panic could be crucial to title race\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s side seem to have such calm throughout games, even after going behind.\n\nThe players trust in the system and their processes, not forcing passes or rushing things in the final third. They scored three today without truly finding top gear.\n\nIf you are to criticise Pep Guardiola\u2019s remarkable Manchester City side, it is that they sometimes look to have a desperation to them in adverse situations, and the panic that can sometimes ensue is often more curse than blessing.\n\nKlopp\u2019s side seem to avoid those moments, and with another ding-dong title battle setting itself up rather nicely, that lack of panic could be crucial.", "description": "Liverpool FC came from behind to beat Newcastle United 3-1 at Anfield and continue their winning start to the Premier League season.
