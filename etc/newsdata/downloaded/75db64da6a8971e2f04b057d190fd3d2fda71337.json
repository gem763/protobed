Media reported the government was expected to announce the ban effective from midnight.\n\nLi's donation comes after property firm New World Development (HK: ) said it would donate 3 million square feet of its farmland reserves for social housing.", "description": "Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing donates $128 million to support local business", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF930EQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
