For Lively\u2019s birthday in August, Reynolds posted a series of very unflattering pictures of his pregnant wife. She followed family tradition by picking out a cute photo to mark the occasion:\n\nLast week, Reynolds shared a not-very-polite birthday song on the big screens during a performance of Jackman\u2019s \u201cThe Man. The Music. The Show.\u201d tour. Jackman retaliated by tweeting a mock \u201cleaked\u201d video of himself complaining about Reynolds to his wife:\n\nWebster\u2019s dictionary definition of a LEAK. 2a.
