The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) is operating a service that automatically transfers change below 10,000 won (or an amount set by its clients) to their savings or investment account for each credit card transaction. Welcome Savings Bank came up with a similar product.In the United States, the birthplace of small-change finance, one fintech company helps customers pay back student loans by saving change.Mrs. Shim, a 40-year-old housewife in Seoul, is one newcomer to the penny-investment field. After signing up for a Toss card, a debit card from Viva Republica that offers such micro-investment services, she accumulated more than 100,000 won in just three months.Viva Republica collected change of less than 1,000 won from Shim\u2019s transactions with the Toss card and saved them to Shim\u2019s account on the company\u2019s mobile-based money wire transfer service app Toss.\u201cI started [the service] out of curiosity, but saving spare change is quite enjoyable,\u201d Shim said.Since its launch in July, more than one million Toss Cards have been issued, far surpassing the industrial standard for success of 200,000 issues per month.Some companies are preparing to start services that allow customers to make investments and buy stock with their pennies.Shinhan Card and Shinhan Financial Investment are planning a service that rounds up spare change from purchases made on Shinhan cards and invests it in foreign stocks.If a client pays 5,000 won for a cup of Starbucks coffee that costs 4,600 won, the remaining 400 won will go toward the purchase of foreign shares.The P2P lending industry, where small transactions are the norm, is a natural in this trend. PeopleFund and HonestFund, two tech-based financial platforms, recently adjusted the minimum transaction amount from 100,000 won to 10,000 won. Lendit halved its minimum amount from the previous 10,000 won to 5,000 won in 2016.\u201cBy lowering the minimum amount to 5,000 won, not only students but also people in their 20s and 30s with low incomes can now make investments actively,\u201d said a spokesperson for Lendit.Pennies have also gained more power in buying insurance.An insurtech company called Bomapp - insurtech refers to applying new technologies to the insurance industry - recently introduced a policy that covers possible accidents for commuters for 700 won per month. Despite the small amount, the policy even provides coverage for violent crimes and hospital stays resulting from traffic accidents. Samsung Life Insurance is also in the game with its 1,090 won per month policy for traffic accident compensation.\u201cCustomized insurance services for cars, travelers and pets are on the way,\u201d said Ryu Joon-woo, the founder of Bomapp.Some analysts say the small change financing market has grown as more people are tightening their belts in the face of an underperforming economy. Pennies have become more valuable for people in their 20s and 30s as they don\u2019t have much to start off bigger investments or saving programs.\u201cDeveloping small change finance products is necessary to target people in 20s and 30s who are familiar with mobile devices but don\u2019t have much money for savings and investments,\u201d Jang said.BY HWANG JEONG-IL and LEE CHANG-KYUN [kim.byungwook@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/09201432.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
