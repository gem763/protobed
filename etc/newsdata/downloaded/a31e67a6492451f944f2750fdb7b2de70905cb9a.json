We say that\u2019s a lie in order to cover up the violent, bad-tempered assault she perpetrated.\"\n\n(Image: North News & Pictures Ltd nort)\n\nOn March 30, Mr Taylor\u2019s friend, Shaun Hunter, arranged to meet him and they bought lager and went to Lee\u2019s home, where her friend was also present.\n\nMr Hunter \u201cfelt there was an atmosphere between the defendant and Mr Taylor\u201d.\n\nHe left at 9.18pm but on his way to get the Metro, he got a call from Mr Taylor asking to meet him, he told his friend his \"head was battered\" and Mr Hunter told him stay with him but he refused.\n\nA shop worker said earlier in the day Mr Taylor had been happy but by 9pm he appeared upset and asked for two bottles of Southern Comfort. He was crying but said he would be okay.\n\nMargaret Mason, Lee\u2019s upstairs neighbour said rowing was a regular feature of their relationship, and had heard a \u201cprolonged argument\u201d between Lee and Mr Taylor that night.\n\nMiss Goodwin said Lee was heard shouting: \u201cIt\u2019s my house\u201d and repeatedly threatening: \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, I\u2019m going to kill you, I will f ** kill you\u201d.\n\nMr Taylor was heard to shout back and Mrs Mason heard \u201csomething akin to a scuffle\u201d, she then heard Lee shout \u201cget out of that\u201d and then again \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you\u201d.\n\nShe then heard: \u201cPaul, Paul.\u201d\n\nLee called 999 herself, saying Mr Taylor had stabbed himself in the chest.\n\nAfter being cautioned and arrested, she said: \u201cHe is the love of my life, are you for f ** real.\n\n\u201dI would not hurt him in a million years. He does it to himself.\u201d\n\nA post-mortem examination showed a single stab wound had passed through a ventricle in his heart, he also had a superficial slash injury to his cheek, a cut to his finger and two superficial wounds to the back of his head.\n\nMiss Goodwin said there were other incidents between them - and between Lee and other men - in which the prosecution say she was the aggressor.\n\nShe told the court: \u201cThe Crown say she had acted violently in the past, not only to Paul Taylor but to others.\n\n\u201dShe has a propensity to be violent.\n\n\u201cThe Crown say she behaved abusively and aggressively towards partners, particularly when in drink.\n\n\u201cShe specifically used violence towards Paul Taylor.\n\n\u201cShe previously threatened to kill him and previously armed herself with weapons, including knives, to threaten unlawful violence.\u201d\n\n(Image: Northumbria Police)\n\nIn 2014, Miss Goodwin said, Lee was convicted of affray, after she threatened to kill a former partner while holding a knife.\n\nJurors were told on another occasion, Lee threatened the ex-partner with a garden fork, poured turps on him and threatened to kill him.\n\nAnother time she repeatedly punched and bit him.\n\nA different ex will say she \"kicked off\" with him after accusing him of being unfaithful and he woke up at 3am to find her punching him in the face. She went on to arm herself with a knife and he suffered cuts to his arm, it is claimed.\n\nWhen he shut a door on her, she smashed it with a hammer, the court heard.\n\nIn February, a friend got a voice message from Mr Taylor and it seems he rang the wrong number.\n\nShe could heard Mr Taylor\u2019s voice and Lee shouting: \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you, get out of my house. I\u2019m glad your son is dead.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict, Mr Taylor's family said: \"We would like to thank the legal team and Northumbria Police for all their hard work.\n\n\u201cWe would also like to thank family, friends and Paul\u2019s friends for their continued support - we could not have got through it without you all.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for us to grieve for Paul properly and allow him to rest in peace.\u201d\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Alan Cairns added: \"We know that no sentence will ever make up for what happened to Paul and our thoughts are with his family and loved ones at this difficult time.\n\n\"Hopefully they can find some comfort in today's conviction.\n\n\u201cThis was an awful attack, which resulted in Paul's death and he consequences of what happened that night will live for Paul's family for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nLee was further remanded in custody and will be sentenced next Wednesday.", "description": "Nicola Lee was described as 'evil, venomous and dangerous' and repeatedly subjected partners to serious domestic violence - now she's killed", "authors": ["Rob Kennedy", "Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "North News", "Pictures Ltd Nort", "Northumbria Police"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20691354.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-JS196567352.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
