REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n\nActivist investor Elliott\u2019s warning comes after Unizo had previously rebuffed an offer from Blackstone. The buyout group this week ratcheted up its pursuit of the company by launching the buyout offer, to which Unizo is still deciding its response.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge you to consider in good faith, and not unduly obstruct, the Blackstone proposal,\u201d Elliott, which owns 13.14% in Unizo, said in a statement.\n\nIt said Blackstone\u2019s offer of 5,000 yen is beneficial for shareholders and the employment conditions Blackstone has offered is \u201cvery generous to your employees\u201d.\n\nA Unizo spokeswoman said the company is unable to comment on Elliott\u2019s statement.\n\nUnizo was little known until travel services provider H.I.S. Co Ltd (9603.T) launched a hostile bid for it in July. Unizo ultimately rejected the bid but attracted the attention of other suitors who see the company as vastly undervalued.\n\nBut Unizo has played hard to get: Last week it rejected a proposal from Blackstone as well as one from an unidentified \u201clocally renowned\u201d fund.\n\nThis month Elliott ended weeks of silence and started to address its concerns about Unizo\u2019s disclosure to its board. That included seeking explanation on its sudden withdrawal of support for a bid from SoftBank Group-owned (9984.T) Fortress Investment Group.\n\nUnizo originally welcomed the \u201cwhite knight\u201d bid from Fortress but later back-tracked.\n\nIn a separate statement, Fortress said it would extend its tender offer period until Nov. 1 from Thursday. It did not sweeten its bid of 4,000 yen a share.\n\nUnizo shares closed at 4,940 yen on Thursday.", "description": "Unizo Holdings' <3258.T> top shareholder Elliott Management pushed the Japan hotel operator to accept a $1.6 billion tender offer from Blackstone Group , warning it would take \"all available measures\" if it fails to do its \"fiduciary duty\".", "authors": ["Junko Fujita", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441774422&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0HH-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
