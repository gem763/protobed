And it's far from the first time has not held back with his forthright opinions while in front of the TV cameras.\n\nRoy Keane was livid with Manchester United and Liverpool players embracing in the tunnel\n\nUnited's Brazilian pair Fred and Andreas Pereira embraced Roberto Firmino and Fabinho\n\nRoy Keane in twenty seconds.

Who is the most overrated player in the world?\n\nWell, according to Keane, it's Jack Wilshere.\n\nThe midfielder was still at Arsenal when he put in a rather under-powered performance in a UEFA Europa League defeat to Swedish minnows Ostersunds back in February 2018.\n\nAnd Keane, working on ITV, was scathing: 'Where do I start\u2026 I think Arsenal are a great example on how not to start a game of football.\n\nArsenal's Jack Wilshere performed terribly against Ostersunds and was ticked off by Keane\n\n'We can talk about being a shambles but they're so slow out of the blocks \u2013 poor attitude.\n\n'The manager summed it up. No energy, no desire, you're looking for your senior players to lead by example.\n\n'I always think, when Wilshere's your captain, to me, probably the most overrated player on the planet.'\n\n9. 'They are just not good at defending'\n\nIt may only have been a pretty meaningless third-place play-off but Keane didn't hold back in his criticism of England defenders Phil Jones and Danny Rose at last year's World Cup.\n\nThey made errors that resulted in Belgium's 2-0 win after Gareth Southgate fielded a number of squad players.\n\nKeane suggested that the pair 'weren't very good at defending' which you'd think would be a prerequisite to being an international defender.\n\nDanny Rose fails to stop Belgium's Thomas Meunier scoring in the World Cup third place game\n\nPhil Jones (centre) pictured after the match in Saint Petersburg, which England lost 2-0\n\n'If you're making the same mistakes every week, it's going to continue. They are not going to change. Rose and Jones,' he said on ITV.\n\n'Because they are just not good at defending, they are not good defenders.\n\n'They are working with some great coaches. If their coaches aren't going to change them, they are going to keep doing it and they are going to cost you big style.'\n\nKeane also tore into Rose following a poor performance in England's recent Euro 2020 qualifying loss to Czech Republic, calling his display 'shocking and abysmal.'\n\n8. Claiming Man City will mess it up\n\nIt's November 2017 and Pep Guardiola's Manchester City have just won 4-2 away to Napoli in the Champions League to book their place in the knockout stages.\n\nIn the Premier League, City remain unbeaten after 10 games and sit five points clear of Manchester United at the top.\n\nBut don't expect any praise from Keane, who mockingly reminds them of past failures.\n\nSergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling celebrate as Manchester City beat Napoli 4-2 in 2017\n\nKeane wasn't impressed by City's performance, saying it's in their DNA to bottle things\n\n'My only concern for City at the moment is that it is in their DNA, as a club, to mess things up. They have previous where people have got carried away with City.'\n\nUnfortunately for Keane, City didn't mess things up, going on to win the Premier League title that season and retaining it 12 months later. The Champions League, however, remains their final unconquered frontier.\n\nNot so Liverpool, however, who were the target of a classic Keane comment in November 2017 following an uninspiring Champions League win over Maribor.\n\n'There's not too much to say about Liverpool. I think if Liverpool were playing out in my back garden, I wouldn't watch them. They're just drifting. Drifting nowhere.'\n\nLiverpool went on to reach the Champions League final that season and lifted the trophy 12 months later.\n\n7. Roy will not be buying from Jesse Lingard's clothing line\n\nIt's Liverpool vs United in December last year. Jose Mourinho's job is hanging in the balance and Jesse Lingard has gone and launched his new fashion label in the days leading up to the fixture.\n\nKeane, whose views on the foibles of the modern footballer are about as sympathetic as a hungry lion mauling wounded prey, joins his former team-mate Gary Neville in criticising the United star.\n\n'If there was a good, strong dressing room that would not be tolerated. That is why I worry about the United dressing room. That wouldn't be tolerated in a good dressing room.\n\nKeane definitely wasn't impressed when Jesse Lingard decided to launch his fashion label in the week leading up to a Manchester United vs Liverpool game\n\nThe Man United star was on the receiving end of a blast from Keane for his 'Be Yourself' range\n\n\"Not this week!\" \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642o@GNev2 and Roy Keane question @JesseLingard's decision to launch a clothing line ahead of this week's clash with @LFC, saying football should be his only focus. \u26bd\n\n\n\nWatch Super Sunday live on Sky Sports Premier League now! https://t.co/ilA0zO28XG pic.twitter.com/1rO0Ji2KZh \u2014 Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) December 16, 2018\n\n'For a young player, who is still learning his trade. Again, he could be the nicest kid in the world, I don't know the lad.\n\n'But if you are coming out with all that nonsense, people say you should have other stuff outside of football, I don't think you should!\n\n'I think football should be your No 1 priority. It should be. Focus on the game, don't hide behind your cars, or your tattoos or your girlfriends or your agent, play the game.'\n\n6. 'You'd have been lynched'\n\nIn Keane's time at Old Trafford, finishing anywhere other that first constituted a major crisis.\n\nBut since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013, standards have slipped to the point where finishing in the top four and making the Champions League is considered an achievement.\n\nKeane slammed Man United's lowered expectations of a fourth place finish this season\n\nKeane and Sir Alex Ferguson lift the Premier League trophy for a third successive year in 2001\n\nAhead of United's match against West Ham last month, a fixture they lost 2-0, Keane said such thoughts would not have been tolerated in his day.\n\n'You're playing for Man United to win. God help me if in our dressing room someone mentioned can we finish fourth as a great achievement, you'd have been lynched,' he said on Sky.\n\n5. 'I don't care if it's Alex Ferguson or the Pope'\n\nKeane was Ferguson's on-field lieutenant for a decade but their relationship unravelled in 2005 following a series of disagreements and Keane's public criticism of the team.\n\nOccasionally the feud flares up again as it did last month when Keane was asked about his Old Trafford departure and claimed United and Ferguson had pushed to get him to leave because he was getting old and didn't get on with Fergie's assistant Carlos Queiroz.\n\n'I wouldn't forgive Ferguson. The media spin, how I apparently upset everybody, it was all nonsense,' Keane told Irish media outlet Off The Ball.\n\nKeane decided to reignite his ongoing war of words with former boss Ferguson last month\n\nThe relationship of the pair has remained frosty for several years with bitter words exchanged\n\n'I don't care if it's Alex Ferguson or the Pope, you're going to defend yourself.\n\n'I think when he apologises I will probably say hello to him, yeah. [But] I've no interest in speaking to the man.\n\n'People talk about Ferguson's man-management. Don't be kidded by all that.\n\n'I was at the club when Bryan Robson left, when Steve Bruce left, two brilliant servants for Manchester United, and I didn't like the way they were treated.'\n\nIt's probably going to be one disagreement that'll never end.\n\nLikewise with Queiroz, with Keane saying during last year's World Cup that he 'should have ripped his head off' after the Portuguese coach questioned his loyalty to United.\n\n4. 'It's TWO YARDS, Gary...'\n\nIt has become appointment television when Sky put Keane in the same studio with the likes of Neville, Mourinho or Graeme Souness.\n\nOne prime example came at the tail end of last season when United were beaten 2-0 at home by champions-elect Manchester City.\n\nAfter United's defenders had failed to close down a City scorer for one of the goals, Keane let rip.\n\nHe starts the debate by claiming United are in bigger trouble than he thought after a lacklustre performance before Neville interjects to defend the players, saying they were knackered.\n\nIt's fair to say that didn't cut any ice with Keane.\n\nKeane and Neville argue over the shortcomings of United's defenders after defeat to Man City\n\nNeville's attempts to defend the 'knackered' defenders cut little ice with Keane alongside him\n\nKeane (right) rolls his eyes as his former United team-mates tries to explain what's going on\n\n'Gary, Gary, it's two yards man,' Keane says. 'I guarantee if we'd done the same, would we be telling you off if you didn't close somebody down? Of course we would.'\n\nAs Neville continues with his explanation, Keane is caught rolling his eyes in sheer exasperation.\n\n'His legs have gone? It's two yards! Get out to him like your life depends on it.'\n\n3. Puncturing the English bubble\n\nIt's July 2018 and England have just lost agonisingly to Croatia in the semi-finals of the World Cup in Russia.\n\nNot that proud Irishman Keane has any sympathy, aiming a barb at his fellow ITV pundit Ian Wright and English expectations in general.\n\n'You have to focus just on one game but everyone's talking about the final... that football's coming home.'\n\nKeane (left) and Wright (centre right) get into an argument over English World Cup hopes\n\nWright leans in towards his fellow pundit after taking exception to his stinging criticism\n\nYes Roy Keane, saying what every Scottish, Welsh and Irish football fan was thinking #ENG pic.twitter.com/zpkbFMxB4H \u2014 \ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7fGordon Strachan\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f (@weeGordieStrach) July 11, 2018\n\nWright tries to claim they weren't being entirely serious but, in apparent confirmation Keane lacks any sense of humour, he continues the argument.\n\n'I don't mind you being happy but you're getting carried away, you were planning the final and where the parades were.\n\n'You can get excited about it when you get to the final - this was the semi-final.'\n\nWright later posted a picture of the pair together on Twitter suggesting they'd made up.\n\nITV pundits Wright and Keane looked to have made up following their fiery exchange on air\n\n2. 'They're very weak human beings'\n\nKeane is often at his best following United's managerial changes and the sacking of Mourinho last December was no exception.\n\nHaving been both a player and a manager, Keane can see both sides of the argument when it comes to who is to blame.\n\nOn this occasion, his sympathies lay entirely with Mourinho with the finger of blame pointed witheringly at the players, who are 'very weak human beings.'\n\n'I do think the players get away with murder, the way they hide behind the manager. They've thrown him under the bus.\n\nKeane sprung to the defence of Mourinho, now his colleague in the Sky Sports studio, when he was sacked by Manchester United last December, blaming the 'very weak' players instead\n\nRoy Keane, former #ManUtd captain, gives a scathing verdict on the players' behaviour over the Mourinho sacking, in an interview with Adrian Chiles.\n\n\n\n\"Shame on some of those players... The players get away with murder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tolerate players that hide behind their agents.\u201d pic.twitter.com/Z459MUrCYU \u2014 BBC Radio 5 Live (@bbc5live) December 21, 2018\n\n'People have said that Mourinho has been falling out with players\u2026 well, you would fall out with them when players turn up overweight, or players aren't training properly.\n\n'Then for some of them to down tools\u2026 shame on them. I'm not Mourinho's biggest fan, but I can't tolerate footballers who hide behind their agents, or their friends in the media. People say I'm a bit old school; I call it good school. No matter what's going on at your club, you go out and give it your all.\n\n'The idea that these players may be a little bit upset... and it's not just at United. The modern player, they aren't just weak players, they are very weak human beings.'\n\n1. 'You're going to war and they're hugging and kissing'\n\nSunday's entry is going straight in at No 1 in this list of Keane punditry gold.\n\nWe're just seconds before kick-off at Old Trafford and Sky are about to hand over to their commentary team when Keane spots something that clearly sickens him to the core.\n\nIn the tunnel, United's Brazilian players Fred and Andreas Pereira hug their Liverpool compatriots Roberto Firmino and Fabinho.\n\nKeane said that he was 'disgusted' with the scenes between two sets of rival players on Sunday\n\nKeane added that 'the players have changed' as he criticised the scenes in the United tunnel\n\nKeane was involved in an infamous disagreement with Arsenal's Patrick Vieira in 2005\n\nThe disagreement between Keane and Vieira was a far cry from the scenes at Old Trafford\n\nNow Keane, who famously spoke to nobody while about to walk out except for the time he argued with his Arsenal nemesis Patrick Vieira at Highbury, launches into a superb rant.\n\n'I\u2019m disgusted with the players. You\u2019re going to war, they\u2019re hugging and kissing.\n\n'Don\u2019t even look at the opposition. You\u2019re going into battle against them.\n\n'The game hasn\u2019t changed that much, the players have changed. You\u2019re going to war against these players and they\u2019re hugging each other. Chat to them after the game, or don\u2019t even chat to them after the game.'", "description": "Roy Keane never gave an inch as a combative, tough tackling midfielder during a trophy-laden career with Manchester United.
