Washington\u2019s deep state\u2014which loves to fight other people\u2019s wars\u2014mobilized to remove him.\n\nYanukovych, who had been elected on the narrowest margin, immediately felt political pressure from the West. He hired The Podesta Group in 2011 to purchase some influence, but to no avail.\n\nU.S. Senator and 2008 Republican presidential candidate John McCain flew to Kiev in December 2013 to foment a successful coup d\u2019etat against Yanukovych, in the name of\u2014get this\u2014democracy.\n\nHaving ousted Ukraine\u2019s democratically elected pro-Russia president to install a Western puppet, it was not long before Washington moved in to take its cut.\n\nVice President Joe Biden became liaison to Ukraine\u2019s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), and his son, Hunter, was made a board member of Burisma Holdings, a top Ukrainian energy company.\n\nHunter had been kicked out of the Navy for cocaine use in 2014. Unlike drug addicts in Ohio, though, he was soon after paid something north of $3 million for his Ukraine work. Not as much as China was paying the Bidens for influence peddling, but still not bad.\n\nThe gravy train was rolling along until someone came on the scene and threatened to derail it. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump began to question NATO\u2019s continued relevance and to criticize America\u2019s foreign policy in Ukraine.\n\nThat\u2019s when the puppet government in Ukraine fought back on behalf of its deep state overlords.\n\nIn a piece headlined \u201cUkrainian Efforts to Sabotage Trump Backfire,\u201d Politico reported on January 11, 2017 that Alexandra Chalupa, a Ukrainian-American operative, began doing opposition research for the Democratic National Committee about Trump and Russia in late 2015.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy worked closely with Chalupa. As Politico reported, \u201cThe Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort\u2019s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia.\u201d\n\nChalupa was so successful in fanning the Russian nonsense that on October 24, 2016, reporter Michael Isikoff portrayed her work as pivotal in a premature victory lap for the Clinton campaign at Yahoo News.\n\nThen Trump won. The deep state was left to hand-off the Russia hoax to a special counsel and hope for impeachment.\n\nThe special counsel, though, determined that Trump and Russia did not collude. By then, the citizens of Ukraine were so fed up that they elected a comedian to the presidency.\n\nUkraine began pounding on the doors of U.S. prosecutors trying to provide evidence that showed a conspiracy to undermine American democracy. Then President Trump called the new Ukrainian president.\n\nIn the conversation, Trump addressed Ukraine\u2019s role in trying to steal the 2016 election from him, specifically mentioning CrowdStrike and Joe Biden\u2019s role in the mess.\n\nI have explained CrowdStrike\u2019s connection previously:\n\nIncredibly, the DNC did not provide its allegedly hacked servers to the FBI for inspection. That task was left to CrowdStrike, a private contractor paid by the DNC. CrowdStrike\u2019s chief technology officer and co-founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a Russian expat and a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank with an anti-Putin agenda. The Atlantic Council is funded by Ukrainian Billionaire Victor Pinchuk, a $10 million donor to the Clinton Foundation, with additional millions promised. On December 22, 2016, CrowdStrike caused an international stir when it claimed to have uncovered evidence that Russians hacked into a Ukrainian artillery computer app to help pro-Russian separatists. The Voice of America later determined the claim was false, and CrowdStrike retracted its finding. Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense was forced to eat crow and admit that the hacking never happened. In other words, at the same time this \u201chighly respected private company\u201d was blaming the Russians for hacking the DNC computers, it was raising a false Russian flag on behalf of the government of Ukraine in its war with separatists. A reputable group of former intelligence officials, the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), has been critical of CrowdStrike\u2019s work, based on its own forensic analysis.\n\nIt was obvious Trump was getting close when Washington moved aggressively to protect itself. There was a leak disguised as a whistleblower complaint, followed by breathless coverage in the New York Times, that would portray the president\u2019s attempt to investigate as an impeachable offense.\n\nMasters of projection, the deep-state conspirators and their friends in the media have accused Trump of trying to collude with a foreign power to influence the 2020 election. Which is a way to deflect attention because the transcript shows the president trying to get to the bottom of Ukraine\u2019s admitted interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nUkraine is the key to the Russia hoax, and it is willing to talk. The Trump Administration would be derelict not to encourage cooperation in the investigation. When the lid finally is blown off this scam, we will find that there was never any Russian interference at all.\n\nThe whole thing was always just a deep state plot run through the puppet government in Ukraine to get Trump. That\u2019s not just a conspiracy theory. It is an actual crime.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1177283945.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
