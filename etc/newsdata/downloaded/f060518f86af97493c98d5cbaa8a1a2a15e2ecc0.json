Going to film with Prince Harry who contacted me about doing a charity idea with him, which is going to be good. I\u2019ve long admired him\u2026 from afar. I guess I\u2019ll see you there!\u201d\n\nIt then cuts to Sheeran ringing a door bell, which plays the British national anthem God Save the Queen, as Harry opens the door to the singer.\n\nThey are both dressed in identical clothes and Harry says: \u201cIt\u2019s like looking in the mirror.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry then says \u201cFor me, this is a subject of a conversation that\u2019s not talked about enough. I think people all over the world are really suffering.\u201d\n\nAs they talk about how they can help, Sheeran says excitedly: \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m trying to do\u2014people don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for people like us.\u201d\n\nHarry looks at him quizzically, and Sheeran continues: \u201cWith the jokes and the snide comments. I just feel like it\u2019s time we stood up and said: \u2018We\u2019re not going to take this any more. We\u2019re ginger, and we\u2019re going to fight.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrince Harry does his best confused face before saying: \u201cThis may be miscommunication, but this is about World Mental Health Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d replies Sheeran, as he is seen hastily deleting the title of a document that reads \u201cGingers Unite\u201d from his laptop.\n\nFunny stuff over, the video cuts to Harry sitting on a sofa with Ed, saying: \u201cGuys, this Mental Health Day, reach out, make sure your friends, strangers; look out for anyone who may suffer in silence. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nVery amusing, we are sure you\u2019ll agree.", "description": "The video is actually in support of World Mental Health day.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2844,w_5056,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570699223/RTX763V3_bt9rar", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
