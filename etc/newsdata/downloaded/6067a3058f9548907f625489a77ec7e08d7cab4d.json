The FCC shows that 24.7 million Americans cannot access broadband in their homes, while other data indicates that 162.8 million Americans do not use the internet at broadband speeds.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a gap, and some of it can be explained by inaccurate FCC data, but not all of it. Skorup said that studies have found that about half of the people who don\u2019t subscribe to broadband are smartphone only, getting their internet through their cell phones and not connections in their homes.\n\n\u201cMobile is enough for them,\u201d he told the Taxpayers Protection Alliance Foundation. \u201cThere are more people going mobile-only every year.\u201d\n\nMany non-adopters say home internet is irrelevant to them, or the cost of a computer is an issue, Skorup noted. He said those residents skew older, rural and low-income, which makes it difficult to make a business case for expanding broadband into the most rural regions of the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe highest-cost areas are where most people not likely to subscribe live,\u201d he told TPAF. \u201cIt\u2019s a big reason why wireless will be a big part of the solution for connecting rural areas.\u201d\n\nWill Rinehart, director of technology and innovation policy for the American Action Forum, said in a paper examining rural broadband economics last summer that \u201can econometric model of FCC data suggests that the presence of broadband does little to explain the unemployment rate, median household income, the change in employment, or the rate of population change in rural regions. Broadband adoption measures are far better at explaining these trends.\u201d\n\nRinehart argues that the current trend in policy is focused on expanding broadband, not promoting its adoption, which may be the wrong way to go about it.\n\n\u201cThe best mix of policies will certainly vary depending on local needs, but the key to helping local economics is getting more people connected to the Internet, not merely increasing availability,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat point was echoed by Blair Levin and Larry Downes in a Washington Post op-ed, which said \u201cthe singular focus on infrastructure deployment distracts policymakers from the actual explanation for why so many Americans are still offline.\u201d\n\nThe two point out that Census Bureau surveys have found that more urban households are unconnected than those in rural areas.\n\n\u201cAnd regardless of geography, access isn\u2019t the main reason these homes are without Internet service,\u201d Levin and Downes wrote. \u201cThe vast majority of U.S. homes without broadband service could have it today, but they don\u2019t want it. The real problem is convincing those who are offline of the value of being part of our digital life.\u201d\n\nThe FCC has moved to create better maps to identify gaps in broadband coverage, initiating a new process on August 1 for collecting fixed broadband data called Digital Opportunity Data Collection (DODC). This process will collect geospatial broadband coverage maps from fixed broadband internet service providers of areas where they make fixed service available rather than using census block data as in the past.\n\n\u201cWe see that as a significant improvement in the broadband data we will be collecting,\u201d Kirk Burgee, chief of staff of the FCC\u2019s Wireline Competition Bureau, told members of the commission\u2019s consumer advisory committee at its meeting last month.\n\nDODC will also allow for public input to be collected on the accuracy of service providers\u2019 broadband maps, facilitated by a crowd-sourcing portal that will gather input from consumers as well as from state, local and tribal governments.\n\nBurgee said this portal will allow consumers to dispute the accuracy of the information offered by providers when their own experiences with the service do not match what\u2019s being reported.\n\nJohnny Kampis is investigative reporter for the Taxpayers Protection Alliance Foundation.", "description": "As examiners of broadband growth debate the accuracy of federal .10/23/2019 5:39:56AM EST.", "authors": ["Johnny", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/162/a52e77e2-7f94-404d-b2dd-7a12edc3d42c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
