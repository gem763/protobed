The tie finished 0-0 before Mauricio Pochettino's side lost 4-3 on penalties. Speaking after the game the Tottenham manager admitted, 'When you have an unsettled squad you always need time to recover the time you lose.' With a number of potential player out-goings in January, most significantly Christian Eriksen, the message was about regrouping the squad: 'We need this mental connection, this energy to be all together, not to have different agendas in the squad.
