District officials have noted the penalty would be imposed on a case-by-case basis at a principal's discretion.\n\nAnother change allows students to order any cafeteria meal, regardless of their debt level. The district previously restricted those students to one choice \u2013 a tuna-fish sandwich meal that led to charges of food-shaming.\n\nIn recent days, the district has faced a barrage of online criticism from high-profile tweeters, including at least three presidential hopefuls.\n\nCaliforniaplans to end 'lunch shaming' with a new bill that guarantees meals for all students\n\nOhio: School changes lunch policy after taking away student's cheesy breadsticks on his birthday\n\n\"This is cruel and punitive,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Monday in a tweet that linked to an article about Cherry Hill's new policy.\n\n\" 'School lunch debt' is not a phrase that should exist,\" Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fellow Democratic contender, said above a similar link.\n\n\"No child should go hungry at school \u2013 period,\" a third candidate, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, tweeted Tuesday. \"As president, I will fight for universal free school lunch and relieve all school lunch debt.\"\n\nCloser to home, the district's congressman, Rep. Donald Norcross, a Democrat from Camden, New Jersey, declared the policy to be \"unacceptable.\"\n\nStudents in line for food at the school cafeteria.

No exceptions.\"\n\nSchool officials have expressed exasperation, with Superintendent Joseph Meloche observing no student has been denied a meal due to unpaid cafeteria charges.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is a discussion going on outside of our community that is dramatically different and not representative of what is going on within our community,\" Meloche said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe new policy also includes outreach provisions intended to identify and help families in need. Officials say that process would not occur if the district used donated funds to erase the debts for all students.\n\nBoard members have said that by being able to identify families and reach out to them, they could connect qualifying families to the free and reduced lunch program.\n\nAnother reason for avoiding donations is that they might inadvertently cover bills for families who are able to pay for school lunches, officials have said.\n\n\"There are children on the arrears list whose families are struggling, and there are children on the list who come from families and homes with means,\" Meloche said.\n\nSchool board members have said families that can afford to pay their children's lunch charges should be required to do so.\n\nBut angry tweets showed the issue in a harsher light.\n\nNationally: 500,000 kids could lose free school lunch under Trump administration proposal\n\nPennsylvania: CEO tries to play hero, pay for students' late lunch bills: School board says no\n\n\"Cherry Hill schools aren't interested in fiscal solvency, They WANT to punish poor kids for being poor,\" Ames Grawert, senior counsel for the Brennan Center, a nonpartisan law and policy institute, told his 5,000-plus followers.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy also tweeted a link to a story on the district, noting, \"No child should be shamed, punished or banned from extracurricular activities over lunch money.\"\n\nBut district officials have noted a state law directs districts to stop serving meals to students if lunch-debts remain unpaid. Cherry Hill's former policy included the mandated language, but did not enforce it.\n\nThe school board in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, approved a new policy for handling overdue lunch payments Oct. 15, 2019.

The program sent food home over the weekend for children in five schools.\n\nCherry Hill cleared $25,000 in school lunch debt two years ago to start with a clean slate. The back payments currently stand at $16,500.\n\nThe protracted and highly public debate began over the summer as the Cherry Hill school district began discussions over how to address the debt.\n\nThe state rule states that districts that have not collected full payment for a lunch debt within 10 days of notification will then send another notice saying lunch \"shall not be served to the student beginning one week from the date of the second notice unless payment is made in full.\"\n\nHowever, once the school board began considering enforcement of other existing policies \u2013 including one that allowed for an alternate lunch such as tuna-fish sandwiches for students with delinquent lunch accounts \u2013 the issue exploded into a national controversy.\n\nFollow Jim Walsh and Sheri Berkery on Twitter: @jimwalsh_cp and @SheriBerkery\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/10/24/cherry-hill-new-jersey-school-lunch-debt-plan/4081710002/", "description": "Critics of the Cherry Hill, New Jersey, school district's lunch debt plan call the plan punitive and lunch-shaming.", "authors": ["Jim Walsh", "Sheri Berkery", "Published A.M.
