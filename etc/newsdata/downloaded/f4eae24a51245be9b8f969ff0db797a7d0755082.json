It\u2019s made from a plush fleece on top with a smooth 100% cotton bottom to keep you comfy while the weight of the blanket helps destress. It\u2019s filled with small glass beads that are sewn between two layers of poly-fill batting to keep them secure. If you need to destress, this is the blanket for you.\n\nCuyana Recycled Cashmere Collection: Most recycled cashmere sweaters are made from only around 5-10% cashmere. Cuyana wanted to change that by introducing a collection that blends 95% recycled cashmere and only 5% virgin wool fiber. The collection features a crewneck sweater, a mock neck sweater, and a soft wrap sweater.\n\nReformation x New Balance Sneakers: Sustainable fashion brand Reformation and iconic sneaker brand New Balance have teamed up to create a stylish shoe that\u2019s sure to impress. The new collection features three silhouettes: the 997W, the X90, and the 574. As for sustainability? Post-consumer recycled polyester is everywhere plus the inserts are made from a combination of EVA foam and BLOOM algae that helps reduce the amount of fossil fuels used in shoe manufacturing.\n\nUniversal Standard Kanda Puffer: Just in time for the changing of seasons, Universal Standard upgraded its gorgeous, best-selling coat. With the addition of a zipper to the tie/snap combination closure, you\u2019ll stay even more secure in the elements. Cruelty-free down alternative was used for warmth and lightness and it\u2019s now, best of all, water-proof. And, as is standard, it comes in sizes 00 to 40.\n\nOutdoor Voices Intramural Capsule: The capsule features a collection of t-shirts and shorts for men and women. The tonal designs of the soccer shorts (or Solar Shorts) were inspired by \u201cpolycrystalline solar panels in Big Bend National Park,\u201d according to a press release. Each pair of shorts purchased helps offset a month\u2019s worth of CO2 emissions. The shirts are 100% cotton and made in LA.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
