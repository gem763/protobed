The judge\u2019s latest ruling is a potential mark in the \u201cwin\u201d column for Varga, as well as other Twitch streamers who might have grievances with Twitch in the future.\n\nThe trouble started back in 2016, when Varga was banned from Twitch after he streamed himself using CS:GO gambling sites. According to an expos\u00e9 by journalist Richard Lewis, Varga allegedly had a financial stake in one of these sites.\n\nTwo years later, Varga sued Twitch for lost income and damages incurred from what he now claims was a wrongful ban. Twitch responded with a counter-suit against Varga that asserted the streamer had violated multiple Twitch policies.\n\nVarga was suing for lost income, and while the legal system has yet to determine whether his ban was actually wrongful and that he should therefore be repaid, his lawsuit has revealed some unusual fine print in the contract he signed with Twitch. Apparently, Varga\u2019s contract stated that he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to receive anything more than $US50,000 ($74,000) from a suit against Twitch.\n\nThe judge\u2019s full ruling, first reported by Dexerto and also obtained by Kotaku, deemed that this $74,000 cap was \u201coverly harsh and unreasonably and unfairly one-sided\u2026 There is no reason to limit Varga to [$74,000] when he might well be entitled to a much, much higher sum.\u201d\n\nThe judge continued, \u201cFrom a practical point of view, which I think is an essential consideration, limiting recovery to [$74,000] virtually kills off the odds of a suit against Twitch at all. The agreement doesn\u2019t appear to have an attorney fees clause, and few \u2014 if any \u2014 lawyers would take on a contingency case against Twitch for some reasonable percentage of [$74,000]. The cap is unconscionable.\u201d\n\nVarga admitted in court that he hadn\u2019t actually read the contract before first signing it in 2012, nor did he read it when he signed a re-upped version of it two years later. He claimed he didn\u2019t know \u201cif that\u2019s what needed to be done.\u201d\n\nAccording to the judge\u2019s summary: \u201cVarga, who spent virtually all his waking hours on computers, and was familiar with a variety of programs, did not know he could scroll through the agreement. He had time, both in 2012 and 2014, to do so, and if he had, he would have seen [the relevant section]. He simply chose not to do so.\u201d\n\nIf Varga had read the contract, the judge theorised that the streamer could have tried to push back against it before signing. Nonetheless, the judge ultimately ruled that the language in the contact was \u201cunconscionable,\u201d meaning the court can ignore this clause when deciding how much money (if any) to award Varga.\n\nOne mark in Varga\u2019s favour was the \u201csignificant difference\u201d between him and Twitch \u201cin their legal sophistication. Varga in 2014 was 26 years old living with his parents, and he had little to no legal experience.\u201d In contrast, Twitch had paid a legal team to draft their end of the bargain, putting the platform at a clear advantage.\n\nAlthough Varga\u2019s case is not particularly sympathetic, since most people just associate him with the CS:GO gambling streams that led to his ban, his case has nonetheless revealed one way that Twitch had been unfair in its contract. Varga may or may not win his overall suit for lost income, but if he does, he\u2019ll now be able to ask for more than $74,000. (According to the ruling, Varga\u2019s income \u201caveraged over $US5,000 ($7,408) per month and appeared to cluster around $US10,000 ($14,816) per month,\u201d so multiple years of lost income would have exceeded the cap.)\n\nThe case will proceed, but regardless of its outcome, this ruling could potentially help other streamers who have a similar clause in their contract and who may bring a suit against Twitch in the future. Most important of all, it\u2019s a reminder to read anything you sign.", "description": "The legal saga between Twitch and the banned Counter-Strike: Global Offensive streamer James \u201cPhantomL0rd\u201d Varga continues.
