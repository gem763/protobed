Researchers from the Center for American Progress recently completed a survey of American foreign policy views. They write: \u201cWhen asked what the phrase \u2018maintaining the liberal international order\u2019 indicated to them, all but one of the participants in our focus groups drew a blank. Voters across educational lines simply did not understand what any of these phrases \u2026 meant or implied.\u201d That by itself is not a problem. The liberal order was built by foreign policy elites, from George Marshall to Madeleine Albright. The problem is that voters are now actively hostile to the project. Instead of widening the circle of concern, most Americans want the U.S. to simply look after itself. The C.A.P. researchers asked 2,000 registered voters what America\u2019s foreign policy priorities should be. The top priorities were protecting against terrorist threats, protecting jobs for American workers and reducing illegal immigration. These are all negative aspirations: preventing bad things from hostile outsiders.\n\nThe things that Brooks derides as \u201cnegative aspirations\u201d are fairly normal national security concerns that most people in most nations would have. Most Americans have this crazy notion that the U.S. government\u2019s primary responsibility is to the security and welfare of the United States, and Brooks wants you to know that he does not like it. He notes that there aren\u2019t many Americans that identify with what he calls traditional internationalism:\n\nThe C.A.P. study estimates that less than a fifth of voters are traditional internationalists. The Eurasia Group study estimates that only 9.5 percent are.\n\nThose numbers are probably right, and they are probably not that different from the past. Why is this a problem? If very few Americans identify with a \u201ctraditional internationalism\u201d that flourished in previous decades, that is because it is a view of the world made by elites for elites. It is also a view that belongs to another era, and it is natural that this will tend to fade as time goes by.\n\nThe U.S. does not face anything like the threat it did during the Cold War, the rest of the world has recovered from the devastation of WWII, and more countries than ever before are democratic, prosperous, and independent. If this is not the time when the U.S. should spend more of our time and resources on looking after ourselves, when will that time ever come? To the extent that the U.S. deserves credit for helping to usher in a better postwar world, the U.S. should also be freed of some of the burdens that it took on in the immediate aftermath of WWII that it no longer needs to bear. The U.S. took on those burdens because the other industrialized nations of the world were in ruins or bankrupt after the war, but that is no longer the case. If \u201cliberal international order\u201d maintenance conflicts with reducing our burdens, why shouldn\u2019t most Americans reject it?\n\nThe assumption embedded in Brooks\u2019 complaint is that the \u201cliberal international order\u201d is so fragile that it cannot survive if the U.S. devotes more of our resources to our own country. It is not at all obvious that\u2019s true. Scores of nations value and uphold the international institutions and laws created after WWII (many of them are much more respectful of both than the U.S. is), and they do so for their own reasons and because it serves their own interests. The U.S. gets credit for helping to build these structures, but we should not assume that they are so dependent on the U.S. that they will fall apart if we do not maintain the foreign policy status quo.\n\nBrooks\u2019 account of the postwar order is remarkable, and not in a good way:\n\nThen, in 1945 that stopped. The number of battlefield deaths has plummeted to the lowest levels in history. The world has experienced the greatest reduction in poverty in history, as well as the greatest spread of democracy and freedom. Why did this happen? Mostly it was because the United States decided to lead a community of nations to create a democratic world order.\n\nThis is a very flattering explanation for why there has not been another global conflagration as bad as or worse than WWII, but I doubt very much that it is a true one. Great power conflict disappeared after 1945 in part because the cost of WWII was so high and horrific that the nations of the world were determined not to repeat that disastrous error, and it disappeared in part because the proliferation of nuclear weapons made the costs of a future great power conflict so much worse that the superpowers settled for fighting each other through proxies and clients instead. The \u201cworld order\u201d Brooks mythologizes did not include most of the nations of the world. The majority of independent states remained non-aligned and wanted no part of the rivalry that still caused so much bloodshed and destruction across much of Asia and Africa. U.S. leadership played an important role in preserving the security and independence of our European and Asian allies, but let\u2019s not get carried away about how broad and inclusive the U.S.-led \u201ccommunity of nations\u201d was.\n\nPerhaps Brooks\u2019 biggest mistake is in thinking that the U.S. is still capable of and competent at \u201cpreserving liberal world order.\u201d Brooks berates non-interventionists on the right and the left with equal disdain:\n\nThe America Firsters and the New Doves may think of themselves as opposites, but they wind up in the same place. America should not be abroad preserving the liberal world order.\n\nThe reality is that the U.S. does a terrible job of \u201cpreserving the liberal world order\u201d and frequently undermines and attacks that very order in the name of \u201cleading\u201d it. The people that Brooks criticizes here are almost certainly more likely to oppose unnecessary and illegal wars of choice and other violations of international law than the supposed \u201cinternationalists\u201d that he valorizes. To the extent that the \u201cliberal world order\u201d isn\u2019t just a convenient and self-serving myth for proponents of U.S. hegemony, its critics are more likely to respect the rules and limitations contained in international law than its loudest supporters. Fetishists of \u201cliberal international order\u201d or \u201cliberal world order\u201d are happy to talk about the importance of a global order based on rules, but they are typically among the first to advocate breaking them when they get in the way of exercising American power. Many of these same people back illegal invasions and bombing campaigns, endorse regime change, and justify interference in the internal affairs of other states all the time. They like to use \u201cliberal world order\u201d rhetoric as a bludgeon against their political opponents, just as Brooks is doing in his column, but they suddenly lose interest in that order when it conflicts with their desire to intervene against this or that regime.\n\nThe argument today is not between those who want to uphold this imagined \u201cworld order\u201d and those that don\u2019t care what happens to everyone else, but between those who still possess the hubris to think that the U.S. can and should \u201clead\u201d the world as hegemon and those of us who believe the costs of this are too high and conclude that the task is beyond the competence of any government.\n\nBrooks makes another set of shaky assertions:\n\nAmerica is withdrawing from the world; the results are there for all to see. China is cracking down on democratic rights in Hong Kong. Russia launches cyberattacks everywhere. Iran is destabilizing the Middle East. The era of great power rivalry is coming back.\n\nIf the U.S. were actually \u201cwithdrawing\u201d anywhere, this would be a potentially interesting point, but there is no evidence to support this. Brooks says it is happening and then lists a number of actions by other governments that most or all of them would have been taking anyway. There are two problems here. First, U.S. withdrawal hasn\u2019t happened. If anything, the U.S. remains as thoroughly mired in the conflicts and rivalries of other regions as ever. Second, other states have agency and are going to act in certain ways whether the U.S. is \u201cwithdrawing\u201d or not. If \u201cgreat power rivalry is coming back,\u201d would an even more activist U.S. foreign policy actually be desirable? Wouldn\u2019t that run the risk of triggering the very great power conflict Brooks claimed that U.S. \u201cleadership\u201d had made a thing of the past?\n\nFor that matter, does anyone think that Beijing would not be tightening its grip on Hong Kong, just as it has been doing for the last 22 years, if the U.S. were somehow even more activist overseas? If Iran is \u201cdestabilizing the Middle East,\u201d what is it doing that it wouldn\u2019t be doing if the U.S. were even more involved in the region? Brooks apparently hasn\u2019t considered these questions, and so he settles for the predictable, false \u201cU.S. withdrawal causes chaos\u201d argument that was tired when it was trotted out ten years ago to bash Obama.\n\nBrooks warns:\n\nWe\u2019re in a dark spiral. Americans take a dark view of human nature and withdraw from the world.\n\nIt is curious that the advocate for optimism has such a bleak view of the present and the future, but Brooks also gets something important wrong here. One of the biggest failings of American foreign policy is that American policymakers don\u2019t usually have \u201ca dark view of human nature.\u201d They accept the idea that \u201cmost people are basically good.\u201d American policymakers are so susceptible to hubris and overreach because they often fail to take account of human passions, vices, and destructive impulses. They assume that everyone wants to be like us. More than that, they think that everyone should want to be like us and that there is something wrong with them if they don\u2019t. They overestimate U.S. capabilities and competence, and they underestimate the difficulties in dealing with other governments and other cultures. The first 20 years of U.S. foreign policy in this century have been marked by an insouciant stupidity about how other nations view the world, and part of the problem is that our policymakers are far too ambitious and optimistic in the worst way possible. It is that ambition and deranged optimism that have kept U.S. troops fighting pointlessly in Afghanistan for 18 years, and that is also what motivates elite pundits to look down on the majority of their countrymen simply because they think that U.S. foreign policy should have some discernible connection to America.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Brooks.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-13"}
