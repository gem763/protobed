According to the Institute of Supply Management figures below 50, indicate a contraction. The new export orders index was only 41, the lowest level since March 2009, down from the August reading of 43.3, according to the ISM. Exports were the key catalyst and with no agreement between the US and China on the horizon, manufacturing is likely to continue to contract.
