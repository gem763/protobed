Why?

Getty\n\nHe slyly played to that argument a couple of weeks after being handed the job when he said: \u201cWe're determined to provide certainty on Brexit \u2013 we are clear the UK is leaving EU by 31 October.\u201d\n\nJavid is surely well aware that if that means no deal it will do nothing of the sort because he\u2019ll have seen all the assessments of the consequences that the government is too scared to publish.\n\nNo deal will turn a gale force wind of \u201cuncertainty\u201d into a record breaking hurricane that will last for months, more likely years. Decades even.\n\nThe problem is, if you tell the truth in front of Dom Dominic Cummings and Don Boris Johnson - I still can\u2019t work out which of them is the boss and which is the under boss - you get shot. Metaphorically (at least for the moment).\n\nJavid\u2019s cowardice stands in terribly stark contrast to the bravery of his predecessor turned Rebel Alliance leader Philip Hammond.\n\nBut the knowledge of that doesn\u2019t help the business community counter the false narrative the government\u2019s muck spreaders are spraying all over the country.\n\nThe addiction to neutral sounding words and phrases such as \u201cuncertainty\u201d is understandable to a certain degree. Every time a CEO opens their mouth, their statements are put under an electron microscope by a battery of analysts and journalists. Regulators too. The statements of those who lead public companies are governed by strict rules and the penalties for falling foul of them can be severe, particularly in the US.\n\nThis, combined with the desire not to offend existing or potential customers, helps to explain why businesses regularly default to bland buzz, even to the extent of making themselves look very silly.\n\nAt one stage I found myself wondering which retailer would be the first to describe shops as \u201ccustomer solutions outlets\u201d. It\u2019s frequently a struggle to work out what it is that some companies actually do, especially in the tech sector.\n\nLobby groups such as the CBI exist to say things they can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, but this culture still feeds through to the way these mouthpieces express themselves. Hence \u201cuncertainty\u201d when what they really mean (and will tell you off the record) is that it\u2019s \u201ca godawful mess\u201d that will \u201cget a hell of a lot worse if the idiot in Number Ten gets his way\u201d. Or words to that effect.\n\nThis needs to end because if business continues to use mild and inoffensive words to describe the situation we face, they will inevitably be seized upon and manipulated by the likes of Javid.\n\nEarlier this week I wrote about a notable exception to the rule. It came courtesy of the British Retail Consortium, which delivered a searing rebuke to no deal planning chief Michael Gove in response to his pooh poohing the possibility of fresh food shortages.\n\n\u201cIt is categorically untrue that the supply of fresh food will be unaffected under a no-deal Brexit,\u201d the trade body declared, in refreshingly plain English.\n\nOther business groups and business leaders would do well to read and reflect upon its statement. This is no time to be tip toeing around and playing nice with the government in the hope of getting \u201ca hearing\u201d. Javid\u2019s statements make it clear that it is only willing to hear what it wants to.\n\nBusiness leaders should make a start by resolving to excise the word \u201cuncertainty\u201d for their vocabulary.", "description": "\u201cA small chink of light for business,\u201d is how the CBI described the parliamentary Rebel Alliance\u2019s bill to block this gangster government\u2019s brutally destructive no-deal Brexit.\u00a0 Director general Carolyn Fairbairn went on to say this: \u201cWith an election looming, many remain deeply concerned about the ongoing impact of uncertainty on the economy.\u201d There\u2019s that word again.", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/19/11/CBI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
