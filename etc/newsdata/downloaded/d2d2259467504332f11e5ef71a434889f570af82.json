Reuters noted ESPN\u2019s version included ten dashes and that ESPN had previously not used the illegal map on its broadcasts.\n\nThe use of the map follows the revelation this week ESPN commanded its employees to not be critical of Chinese communist regime, currently responsible for widespread human rights abuses against nearly every ethnic and religious minority in the country.\n\nA keen observer on Twitter shared images of the map from the Wednesday morning edition of Sportcenter, the network\u2019s flagship sports news show. The map was shown in the context of a report on basketball player LeBron James arriving in Shanghai for an exhibition match amid the turmoil following an NBA executive\u2019s public declaration of support for the pro-democracy protests currently underway in Hong Kong.\n\nESPN\u2019s map includes China\u2019s illegal claims to the Spratly and Paracel Islands \u2013 which belong to Vietnam and the Philippines \u2013 Manila\u2019s Scarborough Shoal, and the waters off of Malaysia and Brunei. The map cuts through one of the world\u2019s richest trade routes and through territory replete with oil and gas resources and fisheries.\n\nChina staked its claim to the region claiming that it has been Chinese since \u201cancient times.\u201d The government of the Philippines sued China in international court after China began acting on its claims, building artificial islands in the territory of Vietnam and the Philippines and equiping them with military assets. Chinese coast guard and government-supported private ships have also regularly partaken in violent acts against Philippine and Vietnamese civilian ships navigating their domestic waters.\n\nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague ruled China\u2019s artificial island construction was illegal and the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d was not a real, enforceable Chinese border. The Communist Party announced it would ignore the legal ruling.\n\nESPN is now using a map that violates international law.\n\nThe broadcast followed a report by Deadspin that revealed an internal memo to employees of ESPN warned them against talking about the Hong Kong protests or Chinese politics on air, significantly compromising their ability to discuss the biggest story in sports today: Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey writing \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\u201d on Twitter.\n\nThe Rockets forced Morey to issue an effusive apology to the Communist Party and offered one itself as a team. The NBA has also apologized on Morey\u2019s behalf. NBA security officials have expelled individuals from games this week for arriving with pro-Hong Kong shirts and signs, which do not violate any stated NBA policy.\n\nChinese state media have compared the Hong Kong protests, in which only Hong Kong police and pro-China mobs have engaged in violence and no deaths have been recorded, to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has repeatedly bullied international corporations for using accurate maps of China. Last year, the American clothing company Gap issued a profuse apology for a t-shirt that showed a real map of China. The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, published the shirt alongside images of the map ESPN used.\n\nAmerican clothing retailer @Gap on Monday apologized for printing incomplete Chinese map on T-shirts for sales outside #China, said the brand respects China's sovereignty and territorial integrity pic.twitter.com/uHJoLnpmr6 \u2014 People's Daily, China (@PDChina) May 14, 2018\n\nCoach, Givenchy, and Versace have been forced to issue similar apologies.\n\nESPN\u2019s parent company Disney makes billions in business with China. The NBA does, as well, and is currently operating a \u201ctraining camp\u201d in Xinjiang province, China \u2013 home to hundreds of concentration camps holding millions of Chinese Muslim ethnic minorities and subjecting them to torture, slavery, rape, and murder.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "The Disney-owned sports network ESPN aired the Communist Party's preferred map of China during a broadcast Wednesday morning.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/ChinaESPNFeatured-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
