I set up my prison advocacy when I was 23 years old, using music as a tool for reformation.\n\nDue to climate change, there's a lot of migration going on. And when there is migration, the tendency for the people migrating to be detained or end up in prison in the location they're migrating to is very high.\n\nThrough my organization, we raise funds to pay bail for innocent, minor offenders. In Nigeria, we've gotten freedom for 120 people.\n\nWhat inspired you to become a climate activist?\n\nFive years ago there was a climate issue in the northern part of Nigeria, drought and all of that, and people migrated from the north to the west. When they migrated to the west, I saw what they went though, trying to get accommodation, trying to fit in in the society, trying to get job opportunities.\n\nThat was where my interest began, because one of the guys I paid freedom for, I asked him, 'What are you doing here?' and he said, 'Oh, due to the crisis, the climate issue in the northern part of Nigeria, I came to Lagos for survival.' So he sells things to people sitting in traffic, like water. The law says don't sell in traffic. But he's trying to survive. They arrested him, and he ended up in jail.\n\nHow do you think your generation's climate activism is different from what's been done in the past?\n\nClimate change in the past was more like, the adults were the ones involved.\n\nWhen the children are involved, the adults take it more seriously, because they are the future. This generation has the power of technology. So this generation is able to mobilize.\n\nThe older generation, you probably had someone fighting for climate change in Brooklyn, for example, but because there was no technology for him to be able to reach the people in Houston or the people in Egypt or the people in South Africa, he was just the one doing it and there was no encouragement. But this generation, a child from New Jersey or a child from Somalia or a child from Ghana uses the power of social media to gain momentum and support globally.\n\nWhat's the first thing:", "description": "Hundreds of young people from countries around the world have their own ideas about how to solve the climate crisis.", "authors": ["Hilary Brueck"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8a2fdb21214c699530f335-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
