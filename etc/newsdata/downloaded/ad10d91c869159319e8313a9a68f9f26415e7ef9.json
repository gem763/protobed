Jones will make his first career start on Sunday when the Giants face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Raymond James Stadium.\n\n\"Ultimately, this is a move that I felt was best for this team at this time,\" Shurmur said. \"I have said it since I got here, I am very fond of Eli. His work ethic, his preparation, his football intelligence. All those attributes are as good as I have ever seen in a player. This move is more about Daniel moving forward than about Eli.\"\n\nDaniel Jones of the New York Giants throws the ball against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paul Brown Stadium on August 22, 2019, in Cincinnati, Ohio.
