His hovers around 830.\n\n\u201cAfter a certain point, it doesn\u2019t matter anyway,\u201d he quipped.\n\nHe\u2019s right. The widely used FICO credit score ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850. A high score \u2014 along with other financial factors \u2014 can place you in a tier that results in the best lending deals. But high scores beyond a certain threshold are pretty much equal.\n\nSo it\u2019s noteworthy that the national average credit score has hit an all-time high of 706, according to FICO, the company that created the scoring model used by most lenders.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big milestone,\u201d said Ethan Dornhelm, vice president of scores and predictive analytics at FICO. \u201cIt\u2019s worth celebrating when you can improve your score to the point that it starts with a seven.\u201d\n\nSince reaching a bottom of 686 in October 2009 during the Great Recession, the national average FICO score has been steadily increasing.\n\nDornhelm said the key drivers of the improvement in scores have been the U.S. economic recovery, consumer credit educational efforts and an initiative by the credit bureaus that has led to certain accounts in collections being removed from people\u2019s credit files.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty stable and growing economy over the last 10 years, driving things like lower unemployment, which in turn drives consumers being in stronger financial health,\u201d Dornhelm points out.\n\nIncreasingly, lenders have been providing free credit scores to consumers. I\u2019ve found that when people know their score isn\u2019t good, they want to work on improving it. The two biggest factors that will boost your score are paying your bills on time and reducing the amount you owe.\n\nSome consumers may have seen a boost in their scores because negative information has been removed. In a report last year, the New York Federal Reserve said collections accounts \u2014 which are unpaid debts sent to collection agencies \u2014 became more prevalent between 2008 and 2012 as Americans went through financial hardships stemming from the Great Recession.\n\nThe data showed the percent of consumers with a collections account dropped from over 14 percent to 12 percent between 2013 and 2017, according to the Federal Reserve. In the fourth quarter of 2017, that share declined to just 9 percent.\n\nThe Federal Reserve noted that the decline in collections accounts was the result of an initiative launched by the three major credit bureaus \u2014 Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Under the plan, which is part of a settlement with more than 30 state attorneys general, the credit bureaus agreed to remove certain debt information from consumer files \u2014 including civil judgments, tax liens and traffic and parking tickets or fines. The initiative also called for the deletion of previously reported medical collections that had been paid or eventually covered by insurance.\n\nFollowing implementation of the initiative, the number of individuals with a collections account on their credit report fell from 33 million down to 25 million between June 2017 and June 2018, according to the Fed report. There was an average credit-score increase of 11 points during the quarter the collections accounts were removed. Some individuals saw their credit scores increase by more than 30 points.\n\nPeople with FICO credit scores in the 800s often wonder why they haven\u2019t achieved perfection. But you don\u2019t need an exceptional score to be considered a premier borrower.\n\nBy the way, I should note FICO also creates industry-specific scores that allow a deeper look at consumer information to determine how risky a borrower may be. These scores can range from a low of 250 to a high of 900, according to Dornhelm.\n\nHere\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t fret that you don\u2019t have a perfect credit score.\n\nLet\u2019s say you want to purchase a car. Your lender reserves its most favorable auto interest rates for consumers with certain lending criteria that include a credit score of 720 or higher. Anything above this benchmark doesn\u2019t give you any extra leverage.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018beautiful\u2019 FICO score is really in the eye of the lender,\u201d Dornhelm said. \u201cEvery lender has their own risk appetite. But I will say, once you\u2019re looking at FICO scores over 700, consumers should be qualifying for most any credit they\u2019re applying for, and at pretty favorable terms.\u201d\n\nSo, if your credit score number starts with a 7, you\u2019re in good company.\n\nReaders may write to Michelle Singletary at The Washington Post, 1301 K St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20071 or michelle.singletary@washpost.com.
