Another 11 voted no\n\nHe told Sky News: \u2018The first person I bumped into as I came into the Palace of Westminster this morning said he was resigning as a whip.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m picking up that there\u2019s deep discontent on the frontbench and in the Whips\u2019 Office.\u2019\n\nHe added that Mr Corbyn had only been persuaded to back a snap poll by two of his closest aides, Seumas Milne and Karie Murphy.\n\n\u2018A clear majority of our Shadow Cabinet were against a December election yesterday but Jeremy Corbyn has been persuaded to override them after interventions from Milne and Karie Murphy,\u2019 he tweeted.\n\nMr Corbyn was forced to agree to an election yesterday morning after weeks of dithering.\n\nOn Monday he said a vote on December 12 was out of the question because it would be too dark for many voters and because some students would no longer be at university.\n\nBut yesterday morning Mr Corbyn had no choice but to say the conditions for Labour to back a Christmas-time poll in the Commons had now been met.\n\n\u2018I have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a No Deal Brexit being off the table,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018We have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to January 31 has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking No Deal off the table has now been met.\n\nWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen. This is a once in a generation chance to build a country for the many, not the few. It\u2019s time.\u2019\n\nSome 11 Labour MPs, including Barry Sheerman, actually voted against the election\n\nDavid Lammy (left) was another Labour rebel as was Margaret Beckett (right)\n\nLater a bizarre video posted on Instagram by the Labour leader showed him clapping his hands together and urging his activists to get on the campaign trail with a thumbs up.\n\nThe pro-Corbyn Momentum movement pledged to mobilise tens of thousands of activists to knock on doors in marginal constituencies.\n\nBased on US political campaigns, they will host hundreds of campaign events, including phone bank parties, street stalls, rallies and campus events.\n\nNational coordinator Laura Parker said: \u2018The choice before us all is clear. On one side there is a Labour Party which will invest in hundreds of thousands of good, green jobs, unite our country and bring real change to communities across Britain.\n\n\u2018On the other side, Tory No Deal extremists, who are happy to sow division amongst us, will sell off our public services and pitch our economy into chaos.\u2019\n\nYesterday Labour suspended its so-called \u2018trigger ballots\u2019 which are being held in constituencies up and down the country to allow members to challenge sitting MPs.\n\nSo far only four MPs were triggered and none ended up being deselected. Labour veteran Dame Margaret Hodge survived her deselection vote on Monday night.\n\nIt is believed that any outstanding candidate selections will be decided by the ruling NEC.", "description": "The Labour leader was effectively given no choice but to cave in and back the PM's bill for a snap poll after it became clear it had Liberal Democrat and SNP support.", "authors": ["Daniel Martin Policy Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/23/20352120-0-image-a-90_1572390611627.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
