Kamala Harris\u2019s political and racial identity. Ruth Eglash breaks down the negotiations for a new government in Israel. And Caroline Kitchener on who die-hard Hillary Clinton supporters will back in 2020.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nHow Howard University shaped Kamala Harris\n\nAs Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) has campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination, her four years at Howard have become central to her personal narrative and political identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo those who see her white husband and question her time in California as a prosecutor in a justice system that disproportionately punishes people of color, Howard has been her rejoinder. It\u2019s her knowing nod to black voters and a character witness for anyone who says her personal heritage is disconnected from the African Americans\u2019 history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was such a conscious decision to surround herself in a black environment,\u201d writer Robin Givhan says, \u201cone that was really rooted in the history of blacks in America, one that \u2014 in particular \u2014 celebrated black exceptionalism. It seems to speak very deeply to the way that she defined herself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from \u201cThe Pursuit,\u201d a series on the 2020 presidential candidates:\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael votes in national election, again\n\nFor the second time this year, Israelis cast their ballots after Benjamin Netanyahu, the country\u2019s longest-running prime minister, failed to form a majority coalition in April.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough more than 90 percent of votes have been counted, it looks like \u201ca dead heat between the two largest parties,\u201d says Ruth Eglash , who covers Israel and the Paliestinian territories.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two parties are the conservative Likud, and the left-centrist Blue and White party. Eglash says that, so far, it appears that Likud and Netanyahu still do not have the numbers to form a coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHe is really known as the political Houdini in Israel, or \u2018King Bibi\u2019 even,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it really comes down to the numbers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\nPantsuit Nation\u2019s pick for 2020\n\nThere\u2019s one thing that Hillary Clinton supporters can generally agree on, reporter Caroline Kitchener says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe number-one priority among Hillary die-hards is beating Donald Trump,\u201d Kitchener says. \u201cEvery single person that I spoke to said that no matter who the nominee is, they will vote for that nominee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond this consensus, pre-election allegiances are murky. Some expected former Clinton voters to dutifully enlist with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another white woman in her 70s who talks policy. Others feel that the group should align with Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) or take refuge in former vice president Joe Biden, whom they think stands a fighting chance against President Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of the women that I spoke to said this is not about being inspirational,\u201d Kitchener says. \u201cThis is not about being historic. This is about winning.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Robin Givhan examines Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s political and racial identity.
