It\u2019s built on the dream that we can grow old while being self-reliant and live that way until we die. That all you need is a tiny bit of help. That you would never want to be warehoused in a nursing home with round-the-clock caregivers. This is a powerful concept in a country built on independence and self-reliance.\n\nThe problem is that for most of us, it\u2019s a lie. And we are all complicit in keeping it alive.\n\nThe assisted living industry, for one, has a financial interest in sustaining a belief in this old-age nirvana. Originally designed for people who were mostly independent, assisted living facilities have nearly tripled in number in the past 20 years to about 30,000 today. It\u2019s a lucrative business: Investors in these facilities have enjoyed annual returns of nearly 15 percent over the past five years \u2014 higher than for hotels, office, retail and apartments, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care.\n\nThe children of seniors need to believe it, too. Many are working full time while also raising a family. Adding the care of elderly parents would be a crushing burden.\n\nI know this fantasy well. When my parents, who were then in their 70s, were unable to take care of themselves, I bought an apartment in Brooklyn that was big enough to fit them, in addition to my husband and our two young children. But then my husband lost his job in the Great Recession, and we could no longer afford the mortgage.", "description": "The assisted living industry is booming, by tapping into the fantasy that we can all be self-sufficient until we die.", "authors": ["Geeta Anand"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/opinion/sunday/01anand/00anand-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
