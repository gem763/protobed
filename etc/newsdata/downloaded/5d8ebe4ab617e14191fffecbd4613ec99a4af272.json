Radradra, the former rugby league player nicknamed \u201cSemi-trailer\u201d, won man of the match awards against Georgia and Wales, the latter of which Eddie Jones described as \u201ca humbling experience to see him play with such, power, pace and guile. It was one of the best displays I have seen\u201d. Statistically, against Georgia he scored two tries and set up three, running 177m with five clean breaks and beating 11 defenders. Against Wales he managed 148 metres from 15 runs, escaped five defenders and broke the line twice to set up scores.\n\nTagir Gadzhiev (Russia)\n\nThe former mixed martial arts practitioner plucked from Dagestan on the shores of the Caspian Sea was a relentless breakdown menace and made 18 tackles in their opening match against Japan alone. Gadzhiev, 25, who plays for Russia\u2019s RC Kuban, had never even played rugby when Russia made their World Cup debut in 2011 but has been one of the finds of the tournament. His final act in Japan was to drive four hours to see fellow Muslims Sonny Bill Willliams and Ofa Tuungafasi to deliver a gift of a \u201cPapakha\u201d hat popularised by the Dagestan-raised UFC fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\nEngland upbeat over Billy Vunipola's chances of facing Australia Read more\n\nTorsten van Jaarsveld (Namibia)\n\nThe hooker who vexed the All Blacks. For 185 seconds, Namibia led the world champions. At half-time, incredibly, it was only 10-9 to New Zealand. And even if it went on to be 71-9 as Namibia (playing population: 900) inevitably dropped off tackles, the man of the match could have been chosen from the first 40 minutes. Van Jaarsveld obliterated New Zealand at the breakdown, allowing Namibia the greatest half of rugby in their history.\n\nJake Polledri (Italy)\n\nDiscussion of superlative performances in the Italy back row have been the almost exclusive preserve of the captain, Sergio Parisse, since roughly 2003, until this World Cup. Openside Polledri has been a revelation \u2013 setting a record for the number of defenders beaten in a match by a forward against Canada when he went past 14 of the opposition. His elevation is timely as Parisse takes his leave from the international stage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Uruguay\u2019s captain Juan Manuel Gaminara was a combative presence for the South American side. Photograph: Mark R Cristino/EPA\n\nJuan Manuel Gaminara (Uruguay)\n\nThe Uruguay captain, all 5ft 7in of him, tackled mercilessly in the unexpected joyous victory over Fiji. While he may not have been the team\u2019s best player during the tournament \u2013 he had competition in that department, not least from Santiago Civetta, his back-row colleague and Felipe Berchesi the fly-half \u2013 in terms of winning hearts and influencing minds, the 5ft 7in openside\u2019s emotional reaction to Uruguay\u2019s first win will live long in the memory. Off the pitch, he used his status to call on World Rugby to build off this performance, saying \u201cwe are screaming for more competition\u201d in an interview before flying home.\n\nBen Tameifuna (Tonga)\n\nBefore facing Tonga, Billy Vunipola spoke about the emotion of facing the nation of his heritage; it also turned out to be a painful experience. Too often it was the sheer bulk of the hugely popular prop Ben Tameifuna in his way \u2013 the heaviest player at this World Cup - once, memorably, it was one of the hardest tackles he is likely to have faced on a rugby field from Zane Kapeli. Tonga\u2019s props made their mark in this tournament with Siua Halanukonuka causing all kinds of problems against France.\n\nEngland upbeat over Billy Vunipola's chances of facing Australia Read more\n\nMatt Heaton (Canada)\n\nTo be fair, Heaton might not seem like the obvious choice given he became the topic of multiple memes when he dropped the ball in front of the tryline against Italy and then suffered a yellow card in the second half. \u201cI pushed through, two-on-one, thinking: \u2018OK, I\u2019m going to get it here,\u2019\u201d Heaton said. \u201cTyler took on a defender and then the ball came out of his hands and I went \u2018oh crap, I better not drop this\u2019, and as soon as you think about something like that, that\u2019s how it works.\u201d But the 26-year-old flanker did score against the Springboks, one of only two tries Canada scored in the tournament. Not bad for a player who most recently spent three seasons playing for Darlington in National League One.", "description": "From flying Fijians and huge Tongan props to diminutive Uruguayan flankers, seven players who lit up the group phase in Japan", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52201872ca2773499069c54537712e5f2f362745/0_0_2419_1451/master/2419.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=96c68819a1d412a6eb6a5d1b8d7d42d5", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
