(Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)\n\nA former National Security Agency contractor accused of leaking classified information on drone warfare is arguing that his actions are protected under the First Amendment, in a challenge to the Espionage Act that has implications for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\n\u201cNo court has ever decided whether or to what extent First Amendment protections exist under the Espionage Act,\u201d his public defenders wrote in a motion filed Monday.\n\nLike Assange, Daniel Hale is accused in Alexandria federal court of sharing government secrets. Jeremy Scahill, a founding editor of the Intercept, published a series and book on drone warfare that included information Hale printed on his work computer in 2014.\n\nLeak prosecutions were rare until President Obama took office. Trump is the first president to prosecute the publisher of classified information along with the leaker, a decision some in the Justice Department opposed on constitutional grounds.\n\nA First Amendment challenge to the Espionage Act was rejected by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, but Hale argues that a decision made when leak prosecutions were almost nonexistent has no bearing here.\n\nHale argues that use of the Espionage Act to prosecute leakers and journalists goes beyond the intent of the law, passed during World War I amid fear of spies and antiwar activists.\n\n\u201cIt is abundantly clear from the history of the Act that it was written with confidence that it would never be used to criminalize actions undertaken to inform the American public,\u201d Hale\u2019s lawyers wrote. \u201cThey all thought it incomprehensible that the Act could or would ever be applied to anyone but spies and saboteurs.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia declined to comment.\n\nThe Espionage Act provisions under which Hale was indicted were added to the law in 1950, during the Korean War, in conjunction with anti-Communist legislation since deemed unconstitutional.\n\nAlong with four charges related to obtaining, retaining and disclosing classified intelligence or national defense information, Hale is also accused of stealing government property. He is set to go to trial next year; if convicted, he faces up to 50 years in prison for the disclosures.\n\nHale\u2019s lawyers maintain that all five charges against him are unconstitutionally broad because of the \u201cchilling effect\u201d on free speech. But they argue one count, of obtaining the information with reason to believe it \u201cwould be obtained, taken, made or disposed of by any person\u201d in violation of the Espionage Act, directly implicates the reporter who received the information.\n\n\u201cCriminalizing communication to a journalist substantially burdens a free press in much the same way as criminalizing publication by a journalist,\u201d they wrote.\n\nHale also argues that the charges against him are redundant, as all four relate to the same eleven documents. The charge of stealing government property, they say in a separate motion, should not apply to sharing information with the news media, although the Fourth Circuit ruled otherwise in 1991.\n\nHis lawyers note that no damage to national security from the disclosures has been alleged, only potential harm.\n\nAssange, who is jailed in London and fighting extradition, is accused of soliciting classified information from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nRead more:\n\nBefore he died in prison, prosecutors were trying to cut down his 40-year sentence\n\n\u2018A failing of the systems\u2019: In rowhouse fire, D.C. missed many chances to save lives\n\nMan who fatally stabbed D.C. runner in random attack sentenced to 30 years in prison\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Daniel Hale is accused of sharing information on drone warfare.", "authors": ["Rachel Weiner", "Local Reporter Covering Federal Court In Alexandria", "Va.", "Local Court In Arlington", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/XR9whT1Iy8WTUNYgoVzJlPugd7c=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DVNVBVXTIUI6JMXTV5KHTZV33U.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
