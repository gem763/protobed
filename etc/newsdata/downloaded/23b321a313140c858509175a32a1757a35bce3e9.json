The way I hear it he was besotted with her\u2026 if he loved her give her back up to us so I can bury my daughter.\n\n\u201cIf I get to see her before I die I\u2019ll be very grateful.\u201d", "description": "Joy Morgan, who was last seen in December last year, was murdered by Shohfah-El Israel but her body has never been found", "authors": ["Chris Kitching", "Image", "Hertfordshire Police", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528604.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_BREAKING-Missing-Joy-Morgan-Police-searching-for-murdered-student-midwife-find-body-in-woodland.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
