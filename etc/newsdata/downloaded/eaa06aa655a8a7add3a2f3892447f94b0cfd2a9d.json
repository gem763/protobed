I went and sat down and the wife called 911.\"\n\nWhile en route to the hospital, Briggs reportedly had a heart attack in the ambulance.\n\n\"It caused this recurrent arrhythmia which is associated with death,\" said Dr. Gregory Stefano of University Hospitals Geauga, who treated Briggs.\n\nBriggs's heart purportedly went into a ventricular fibrillation \u2014 a condition in which the heart beats erratically and causes the ventricles to shake instead of pumping blood. As a result, paramedics shocked him once in the ambulance.\n\n\"Usually it\u2019s just one and done, in terms of getting the heart back into a normal rhythm,\" said Stefano. \"But in Frank\u2019s case it was just incessant, it wouldn\u2019t stop.\"\n\nOnce Briggs was in the emergency room, medical staff shocked him 33 more times before his heart was stabilized enough for surgery. Fortunately, Stefano was eventually able to carry out the procedure and unclog the blocked artery.\n\n\"He was living on the E.R. staff beating his heart by chest compressions because when you have that rhythm, a heart just is not squeezing out blood and doing what it is supposed to do,\" Stefano said.\n\nMonths later, the Ohio man is slowly recovering but must receive physical therapy several times a week.\n\n\"I\u2019m alive, pretty good. My brain is not much worse than it was before, which wasn\u2019t the greatest,\" he said. \"I'm still here.\"\n\nStefano said his patient's lucky to be alive, thanks to his wife's quick thinking.\n\n\"If Frank\u2019s wife would\u2019ve brought him in and he had the arrhythmia in the car, there would\u2019ve been no way to save him,\" the doctor said. \"He was saved because medical personnel were right on top of him right away.\"", "description": "A 63-year-old man from Ohio who had his heart shocked 34 times is coming forward with his near-death experience to educate others", "authors": ["Justin Chan"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HFOr8.wwx11SXZrPyhXfyA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1922x1259+0+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/aa738ad0-e3b7-11e9-bbbb-4fe8dd4d4c5c", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
