He's balanced in his teenage years.\"\n\nJolie also revealed, \"He got tattooed.\"\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress has had her kids by her side for most of the Maleficent 2 red carpets, with Maddox even joining her at the Tokyo, Japan, premiere. Jolie told ET that she wouldn't have it any other way.\n\n\"It would be quite lonely if I was doing it all by myself,\" she confessed. \"It's never fun to focus on yourself anyway. When you're all taking care of each other and you're making a game out of it and being silly, it's nice for me as a mom. It's moments.\"\n\nJolie continued, \"I'm also watching my kids grow up and watching my daughter put on a beautiful dress and figure out the right heels and all that mom stuff. It just means a lot.\"\n\nView photos Vivienne, Angelina Jolie, Zahara, Shiloh and Knox attend the premiere of 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' at Odeon IMAX Waterloo on Oct. 9, 2019 in London, England.
