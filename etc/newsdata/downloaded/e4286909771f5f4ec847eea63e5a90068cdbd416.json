I did not see myself represented in the classic children\u2019s books or the media I consumed,\u2019 Vese tells Metro.co.uk.\n\n\u2018It left a lot of children with the subconscious idea that black is second class.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When I had my daughter two years ago, I realised we had made very little progress. There weren\u2019t many quality children\u2019s books that featured a black or minority ethnic main character.\u2019\n\nIn 2017, less than 1% of children\u2019s books in the UK featured a BAME main character. That is what Vese is hoping to change.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want her to grow up with the same experience I had,\u2019 she says. \u2018I wanted to create a diverse children\u2019s character she and kids everywhere can love and identify with.\n\n\u2018Children like her deserve to know they are important\u2019 (Picture: Vese Aghoghovbia Wolu)\n\n\u2018One who is brave, confident and happy, goes on adventures, as curious as George, laughs from within and loves wholeheartedly with tight hugs and lots of kisses.\u2019\n\nVese says this is more important than simply seeing a character who looks like you, she says it feeds in to a child\u2019s sense of self-worth.\n\n\u2018She deserves to know that she matters,\u2019 explains Vese.\n\n\u2018Children like her deserve to know they are important. Children around the world deserve to see the world for the richness and diversity that it offers.\u2019\n\nWhen Vese presented the book to Philly, she was delighted and could barely contain her excitement.\n\n\u2018She kept pointing at the pages of the book with a massive smile on her face,\u2019 says Vese. \u2018I have videos of her acting out different scenes without any prompting. It made my heart melt, watching her take in and instantly replicate what she saw.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She\u2019s also such a daddy\u2019s girl; she loves the scene with the dad tickling Philly.\n\n\u2018I felt it was important to highlight the father-daughter relationship, which is so vital in the development of confidence in children, particularly little girls.\u2019\n\nThe key message of Who Do I See in the Mirror? is self-love and acceptance. It encourages children to love each part of their body while reminding them that they are so much more than their physical appearance.\n\n\u2018The book concludes with a strong message that it\u2019s what is on the inside that counts,\u2019 explains Vese.\n\n\u2018As Philly looks at her reflection in the mirror, she realises that from her curly hair to her legs that love to dance, she is unique.\n\n\u2018But what makes her truly special is her good heart and curious mind. The important message conveyed is for children to love the skin they are in. It\u2019s what you are on the inside that matters most.\u2019\n\n\u2018I felt it was important to highlight the father-daughter relationship\u2019 (Picture: Vese Aghoghovbia Wolu)\n\nVese wants to use her work to give back. She says that her mission is to empower literacy in disadvantaged communities.\n\nFor every book sold, Vese sponsors the shipment of a book into the hands of an underprivileged child through a partnership with Books2Africa.\n\n\u2018We must do right by the next generation,\u2019 says Vese. \u2018Our children need to see themselves and others represented in the books they read, toys they play with and the media they consume.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Representation is everything; it shows our kids that they matter. You believe what you see, and you become what you believe.\u2019\n\n\u2018I truly believe that diverse books aren\u2019t just for kids from minority ethnics; they are for everyone. They teach love, tolerance and acceptance; they make the world a better place.\u2019\n\nVese is now working on a children\u2019s non-fiction biography called Remarkable African Women: 40 Brave African Women.\n\nThe book introduces the untold stories of 40 inspirational women from different African countries, including Asli Hassan Abade; the first female military pilot in Africa and Funmilayo Ransom-Kuti; a women\u2019s rights activist and first Nigerian woman to drive a car.\n\n\u2018I had a negative experience during my A-levels in Bristol. I was walking home from school in and had some kids laughing and chanting behind me. I got home to find they spat me, my winter jacket was covered in spit,\u2019 explains Vese.\n\n\u2018Looking back, I can\u2019t help but think, if we told \u201cour stories! and these kids understood who we are, they might have been a tad bit nicer.\n\n\u2018I hope through this book, children around the world will grow up understanding that we are all the same, human at the core. Underneath the skin is a heart and soul that desires to be loved and accepted.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Father-of-six marries his girlfriend from his hospital bed just hours before dying of cancer\n\nMORE: The health dangers of not getting enough sunlight\n\nMORE: Man sick of daily grind and city living quits job to climb all 1,001 mountains in the UK and Ireland\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Vese Aghoghovbia Wolu was sick of the lack of diversity in kid's books, so she wrote her own to teach her daughter self-love.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/diverse-book-comp_1571996869.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
