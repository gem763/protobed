His teammates immediately checked on him. Seeing Mahomes\u2019 condition, receiver Tyreek Hill put his hands on his helmet in concern \u2014 a feeling shared by a legion of Chiefs fans. Mahomes is a big reason why Kansas City was a preseason favorite to reach its second straight AFC championship game.\n\nBroncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. showed his respect by coming over and shaking Mahomes\u2019 hand.\n\n\u201cYou looked at it and were like, \u2018Oh no, there is something wrong with him,'\u201d Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said. \u201cYou just hope a guy isn\u2019t injured that bad and can come back.\u201d\n\nOne of the members of the Kansas City medical team worked on the knee to help straighten it out. A cart was summoned to take him away, but Mahomes refused to use it.\n\nInstead, he put an arm around each trainer and made his way off the field. Mahomes, who entered the game with a sore ankle, then slowly made his way into the locker room.\n\nSeattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson wrote on his Twitter account: \u201cPraying for you bro.\u201d It was a similar sentiment shared by Houston QB Deshaun Watson on social media: \u201cPraying my bro @PatrickMahomes is straight!\u201d\n\nThe reigning MVP was 10 of 11 for 76 yards and a 125.8 rating before his injury.\n\nMahomes has thrown 15 touchdown passes and one interception this season. Last weekend in a loss to Houston, Mahomes recorded his 14th career game with at least three TD passes. That\u2019s third-most in team history.\n\nMoore\u2019s number was called. Before going in, he tapped Mahomes on the chest and wished him well. When Moore entered the huddle, he had a quick conversation with his teammates.\n\n\u201cJust something to let them know we were going to be all right. Kind of got them fired up a little bit,\u201d said Moore, who didn\u2019t play last season. \u201cI just said, \u2018Hey, I need you guys. You guys need me. Let\u2019s go here. Help me and let\u2019s go.'\u201d\n\nIt worked. Moore finished 10 of 19 for 117 yards and a 57-yard TD strike to Hill in the third quarter. Moore also had a grasp of the playbook despite being signed around two months ago after an injury Chad Henne.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Let\u2019s go. I know it all. I\u2019m good. Just call it. Let\u2019s roll,'\u201d Reid recounted. \u201cHe\u2019s got ice water in the veins, that whole deal. He doesn\u2019t flinch. There\u2019s no panic.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, Moore said Mahomes addressed the team in the locker room and praised the defense for a nine-sack performance.\n\nThen, he complimented Moore.\n\n\u201cHe said something about me, yes,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe said, \u2018How about my guy, Matt?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m trying to downplay it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited for the win, division opponent, road game \u2014 all things that are hard to do,\u201d Moore added. \u201cAt the same, a guy like Patrick gets hurt it can be deflating. He\u2019s obviously a huge part of this team, a huge part of the league. You hate to see that. We all know that injuries are part of this game. He\u2019s doing to do his best to get back out as quick as he can.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "DENVER (AP) \u2014 Now the wait begins to see how long it takes Patrick Mahomes to return from a gruesome right knee injury.
