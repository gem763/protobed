I tore through it, totally wrapped up in Laurel\u2019s war with herself \u2014 with the conflict of externally having what other girls want but living with this invisible heaviness that slowly ate her from the inside out. I loved the deep but nuanced dive into the power of peer influence and the weight of grief. As an adult who had been cheer captain and class president, a high schooler who \u201cseemed to have it all,\u201d as a classmate once put it, but who also fought to hide her relative poverty and a troubled home life, I got Laurel. And though I never spiraled into drug use, I appreciated seeing what might\u2019ve happened if I\u2019d chosen that path.\n\nIt was the first explicitly teen-centered book written by a fellow black woman to crawl down inside me, grab hold of my heart and squeeze.\n\n\n\nThe author Jacqueline Woodson. (Tiffany A. Bloomfield)\n\nIn truth, I could\u2019ve grabbed any of Woodson\u2019s books \u2014 and there were plenty to choose from in both the YA and middle-grade sections of the library where I found \u201cMeth Moon\u201d \u2014 but I was afraid.\n\nThe fiction I was used to reading by lauded black women writers \u2014 Toni Morrison, Zora Neale Hurston, Alice Walker, Nella Larsen \u2014 while rich and textured and stimulating, oozing that elusive snap, crackle and pop known as literary merit, often left me feeling emotionally wrung out. The works were stunning in their authenticity and in the way they made the struggle of blackness tangible through metaphor, and by exposing the truly horrific circumstances black folks have had to live through in this country, they revealed an indomitable resilience inherent in our spirits.\n\nBut they were painful to read. They are painful to read still.\n\nBy the time I heard about Jacqueline Woodson, I\u2019d had enough gut-wrenching reading about people who looked like me, thank you very much.\n\nSo. I grabbed the book about the white girl.\n\nWoodson\u2019s writing stuck with me. There was something about the way she cut to the core of a narrative using the fewest words possible \u2014 but always the right words. As a budding writer myself, that was something I needed to figure out how to do.\n\n[How a kid who didn\u2019t read a book until he was 17 grew up to become a literary star]\n\nI decided to check out the audiobook versions of \u201cLocomotion\u201d and \u201cPeace, Locomotion\u201d from the library next, knowing full well that I might be wading into arduous waters. I figured listening would make the blows to my spirit easier to take.\n\nAnd there were some blows. Of course there were. It\u2019s a pair of books \u2014 one in verse and one epistolary \u2014 written from the perspective of a black boy who, after the loss of both parents in a fire, winds up in foster care separate from his baby sister. (I teared up even typing that just now.)\n\nThere was \u2014 is \u2014 something else, though. A thing that I have since discovered is laced through every Woodson children\u2019s book I\u2019ve had the pleasure of devouring: hope.\n\nIt\u2019s true of \u201cBeneath a Meth Moon,\u201d and it\u2019s true of her books about black children: \u201cMiracle\u2019s Boys,\u201d \u201cFeathers,\u201d \u201cIf You Come Softly,\u201d \u201cAfter Tupac and D Foster,\u201d and on and on. It\u2019s even true of her book about herself, the (deservedly) acclaimed \u201cBrown Girl Dreaming.\u201d And it\u2019s that balance of truth and hope that will keep a literary-heartbreak-hating reader like me coming back to her kid lit, as we call it, over and over again.\n\nBut what of Ms. Woodson\u2019s adult fiction? It could be said that books written for children have to be hopeful; otherwise, no one would buy them. Is the veritable queen of kid lit \u2014 Woodson is the National Ambassador for Young People\u2019s Literature, after all \u2014 able to bring that same balance of veracity and optimism to her fiction for grown-ups?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIn fact, \u201cRed at the Bone,\u201d Woodson\u2019s second work of adult fiction in three years, does much more than perfectly balance truth with hope. The multi-point-of-view, time-hopping saga traces the effects of race, religion, sexuality and class through three generations of a black family in Brooklyn, beginning with the youngest member, Melody, as she prepares for the coming-of-age ceremony that exists in the narrative as an opening, a bridge and a coda. It is through this ceremony that we learn of Melody\u2019s strained relationship with her mother \u2014 whom she calls by her first name, Iris \u2014 and her mother\u2019s strained relationship with her own parents and with Melody\u2019s father. We see the consequences of self-sacrifice for the happiness of another, and the inevitable fallout that permeates the relationships of a woman who chooses herself and a future of her own making over the one that\u2019s expected of her.\n\n[\u2018Another Brooklyn\u2019 reminds us of a Brooklyn far from the tony borough of today]\n\nWe see that love is enough \u2014 until it isn\u2019t. The power of hurt both inflicted and received, hidden and exposed, unintentional and fully known. We see life and we see death \u2014 of feelings, of people, of hopes and dreams. Things lost and things found. A shoving apart and a coming together.\n\nBut what\u2019s more than all that, \u201cRed at the Bone\u201d showed me something I didn\u2019t realize I needed in a book: home.\n\nBecause throughout their trials, tribulations and triumphs, the people in this book were my people. This family, my family. Their ups, their downs, their pains, their pleasures, I have known them like I know my own skin.\n\nTheir history is my history.\n\n\u201cRed at the Bone\u201d is a narrative steeped in truth \u2014 and, yes, it\u2019s painful. But it\u2019s also one of healing and hope.\n\nThank you, Ms. Woodson, for leading me home.\n\nNic Stone is the author of several books for young readers, including \u201cOdd One Out\u201d and \u201cDear Martin.\u201d At 7 p.m. on Thursday, Sept. 19, Jacqueline Woodson will be in conversation with Lynn Neary at Politics and Prose, 5015 Connecticut Ave. NW, Washington, DC.", "description": "With \u2018Red at the Bone,\u2019 Woodson extends her range and grabs us with a story that balances pain and hope.", "authors": ["Nic Stone", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qXlhlx4KLcuyrgGAimxk6EK69sg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TWLEQIWZRUI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
