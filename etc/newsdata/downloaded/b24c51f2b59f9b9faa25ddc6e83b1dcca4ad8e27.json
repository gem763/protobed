Can you believe?!\u201d\n\nThe president then looked across the audience and commented about how attractive his supporters had become.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about me, but you look all much better than you did three years ago,\u201d he said to loud cheers.\n\n\u201cYou look all much better than you did three years ago,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou\u2019re wealthier\u2014and even with the #MeToo movement, I can\u2019t say this but I\u2019ll say it anyway\u2014you\u2019re all better looking, including the men. Including the men. Nah, you\u2019re all looking good.\u201d\n\nAfter taking credit for how smoking hot MAGA nation is looking right now, the president went on to question how he lost New Mexico, since it is \u201cdoing better than any state in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain that one,\u201d he wondered. \u201cHow do we lose that one? And yet, for whatever reason, it has been quite a while since a Republican won the state. But I think we are going to win this state easy.\u201d", "description": "\u201cYou're wealthier\u2014and even with the #MeToo movement, I can't say this but I'll say it anyway\u2014you're all better looking, including the men.
