Divac threatened to retire, but eventually relented on joining the Hornets. After the moratorium, Bryant went to Los Angeles, where he had a Hall of Fame career.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t let go of draft night, though.\n\nBryant on the Knuckleheads podcast:\n\nYou get drafted, you get on the phone with the GM of the team that drafted you and all this stuff. So, I get on the phone with the Charlotte GM. He just tells me, \u201cHey, you know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Like, \u201cYeah. Yeah, yeah.\u201d And you\u2019ve got media in front of you and all that. And he goes, \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing we\u2019re trading you, because we couldn\u2019t have used you anyway.\u201d You motherf. OK. OK. Alright. So, that\u2019s what happened on draft night. So, I was already triggered. I was triggered. I was ready to go to the gym. Like f\u2014 the media. I don\u2019t want to do any more interviews. I\u2019m trying to \u2013 what are you telling me that for? I\u2019m 17. What are you telling? OK. Alright.\n\nThe Hornets\u2019 general manager was Bob Bass. He died last year, so he can\u2019t tell his side of this story.\n\nHowever, in previous tellings, Bryant said Charlotte coach Dave Cowens delivered that message. Cowens denied it.\n\nDid Bryant forget whether he talked to the general manager or coach? Forget which position Cowens held? That\u2019d be perfectly understandable decades later.\n\nOr maybe both Bass and Cowens were on the call. Perhaps, Bryant initially thought Cowens said it and more recently learned it was Bass. That could explain Cowens\u2019 denial.\n\nBut\u2026\n\nStephen A. Smith of The Inquirer at the time:\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday, the Hornets took Bryant with the 13th pick of the NBA draft. Within minutes, there was talk of Bryant\u2019s going to L.A. Dave Cowens, the Hornets\u2019 new coach, was among those who raised the possibility, dismissing Bryant as \u201ca kid\u201d who would have a hard time playing for Charlotte.\n\nThat was a reasonable expectation. Bryant was just a teenager. Charlotte had veteran wings like Glen Rice and Dell Curry.\n\nBut Bryant was that special. He quickly became a contributor with the Lakers then developed into an all-time great.\n\nIn part because he fanned his competitive fire with perceived slights like this one.\n\nBryant is right: Who would say that to a 17-year-old? It just sounds cruel. Of course, Bryant would want to avenge being treated that way.\n\nHere\u2019s my guess: Someone from Charlotte \u2013 either Cowens or Bass \u2013 tried to comfort Bryant in a chaotic situation by saying the trade would work out for the best because the Hornets wouldn\u2019t have played him much. It was supposed to be nice. Bryant took it as an insult.\n\nBut that\u2019s just a guess. It was a private conversation many years ago. We\u2019ll probably never know exactly what was said, let alone what was intended.", "description": "Kobe Bryant spent 16 days as a Charlotte Hornet.
