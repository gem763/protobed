Richard Wolf reports. USA TODAY\n\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo apologized after facing a backlash over an exchange he had about gender pronouns with Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., during the CNN Equality Town Hall on Thursday.\n\nAs Harris walked on stage for the discussion about LGBTQ rights and equality, she greeted Cuomo and thanked the audience.\n\nShe then immediately presented her preferred gender pronouns, or the set of pronouns an individual uses to describe themselves.\n\n\"Thank you, guys. And my pronouns are she, her, and hers,\" Harris said to the audience.\n\n\"She, her, and hers?\" Cuomo asked. \"Mine too.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Harris flatly responded.\n\nCuomo's comments were met with backlash. LGBTQ advocacy organization GLAAD called it \"so disappointing\" for Cuomo to \"mock\" Harris.\n\nEquality Town Hall: Protesters draw attention to violence against transgender women of color at CNN LGBTQ town hall\n\nThe response led to Cuomo's apology.\n\n\"When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality,\" Cuomo wrote on Twitter. \"Thank you for watching our townhall.\"\n\nTraditional pronoun usage can often present issues for transgender or gender nonconforming people, who might prefer a different pronoun than the one others initially use to describe them. Harris is one of several Democratic presidential candidates who include their preferred pronouns in their Twitter account biographies.\n\nLGBTQ issues: 'Trump is a reaction to our great progress': LGBTQ voters looking for change in 2020\n\nPLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. \u2014 Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019\n\nKamala Harris declared her pronouns on such a major stage and she should be applauded but instead it was so disappointing for Chris Cuomo to mock it in that moment. #EqualityTownHall#PowerOfOurPride \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 11, 2019\n\nZach Ford of the Alliance for Justice said Cuomo \"[ruined] this important moment.\"\n\nAs soon as she is introduced, @KamalaHarris immediately shares her pronouns. Then @ChrisCuomo promptly ruins the important moment. #EqualityTownHallpic.twitter.com/GqjVXBwmfx \u2014 Zack Ford (@ZackFord) October 11, 2019\n\nThe National Center for Lesbian Rights tweeted at Cuomo to say \"people's pronouns are not a punchline.\"\n\nDear @ChrisCuomo, people\u2019s pronouns are not a punchline. In a year where LGBTQ Americans are finally being recognized on the national Presidential stage, making jokes about gender pronouns is beneath your dignity. Please do better in the future. #EqualityTownHall \u2014 National Center for Lesbian Rights (@NCLRights) October 11, 2019\n\nThere is a producer at CNN somewhere saying \u201cI didn\u2019t think I needed to tell him not to do that\" https://t.co/GPXU2wwGwf \u2014 Ben Dreyfuss (@bendreyfuss) October 11, 2019\n\nThere couldn\u2019t possibly be a worse forum for him to make this extremely stupid joke https://t.co/cQf1ExuutE \u2014 Laura Bassett (@LEBassett) October 11, 2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/11/cnn-anchor-chris-cuomo-apologizes-after-backlash-over-gender-pronouns/3941703002/", "description": "\"She, her, and hers?\" CNN host Chris Cuomo asked, after Sen.
