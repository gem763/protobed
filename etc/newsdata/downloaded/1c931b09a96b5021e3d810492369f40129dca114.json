Just \u2026 what is happening with them? Are they okay? Because each and every one of them is doing something preposterous. I don\u2019t just mean in Paradise. Look around \u2014 everywhere you look, there\u2019s a man just doing a thing that no one asked for. No one asked for ANY OF THIS. You can\u2019t see it, but I\u2019m gesturing wildly to the general environs. But there seems to be something else happening. Men are now not only doing things that are too much, but they also seem to think just standing and plainly stating what is wrong with them without actually doing anything to fix that problem is the same as fixing the problem.\n\nImagine how that would work in any other situation. If a plumber came to your house and said, \u201cListen, your toilet is broken and I know that and, honestly, I\u2019m thinking about that so hard.\u201d If your math teacher looked at you and just said, \u201cI know I\u2019m supposed to teach you the Pythagorean theorem and I\u2019m so scared and I\u2019m nervous because anything can happen.\u201d Well, \u201canything\u201d won\u2019t happen if you actively teach me some damn math. Because, Dean, you could prevent being \u201ca bad boyfriend\u201d if you did literally one thing to be a good person.\n\nAnd I must admit that it isn\u2019t just the men this week. Almost everyone in Paradise has me writing down, \u201cWell, it sounds like you should talk to a therapist about that\u201d and \u201cThat sounds like your problem and not someone else\u2019s\u201d in my notes, because folks seem to think that it\u2019s the job of the other person in the relationship to fix all your problems.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nThe first person to offload any and all emotional responsibility is Dean. OH. DEAN. You sad, smarmy, vain bitch. He\u2019s shaved off his mustache and thinks jokingly that Caelynn totally could have thought he was an idiot for asking her to leave Paradise with him, BUT SHE DOESN\u2019T HA HA HA! Dean says that there are things for them to work on but he wants to try because that\u2019s all we could ever ask of an attractive man who has appeared on television.\n\nFortunately for Dean, Caelynn seems to lack any decorum, tactfulness, or desire to let Connor down easy. She takes him aside and tells him that Dean asked her to leave Paradise and then stares at him. What does he have to say about all of this? Connor just says things that Dean has done, like dump Caelynn on her birthday. Caelynn nods and says that Connor makes some good points but she\u2019s absolutely intent on ruining her life over some dude wearing all black chambray. There was really nothing Connor could have done.\n\nKristina confronts Dean because no one else on the daybed 75 feet away has any idea what\u2019s going on. Dean says that he\u2019s just trying to do the right thing by asking Caelynn to hurt someone else\u2019s feelings to satisfy his whims. Sure, he knows he runs away from relationships when they get too real, and SURE, he\u2019s already run away from this relationship once, but now he\u2019s trying.\n\nCaelynn finally sits down with Dean again and says that he spent the entirety of Paradise talking about what a terrible boyfriend he would be and that she\u2019s scared of getting hurt again. Dean tells her that Connor might hurt her so why not go for the option that has already hurt her in the past? Listen, I\u2019m not the biggest Caelynn fan, but MY GOD, RUN. RUN FAR AWAY, WOMAN. Just because a guy changes his facial hair does not mean he\u2019s done any of the actual reflection required to be a better person. When a guy tells you he \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he\u2019s not being spontaneous and romantic. He\u2019s telling you that he has no obligations between now and the end of the year, including any obligation to you. Caelynn says she\u2019s going to fly back with him, and when he asks if she\u2019s sure, she says, \u201cIt feels wrong!\u201d Aaah, modern romance!\n\nThen they make out in front of everyone because nothing matters and everything is terrible. Everyone cheers and shrieks and then the camera cuts to Connor. Long Michael Cera is crushed. All the women who have been watching Dean and Caelynn like a soap opera in a doctor\u2019s waiting room remember that these are real people whose actions affect other real people. Caelynn sits down with Connor to do the most perfunctory breakup in Bachelor in Paradise history. \u201cI\u2019m leaving with Dean. My bad, I guess. This doesn\u2019t make sense but bye,\u201d then she reenacts the final scene of The Graduate with Dean wearing a white bathing suit instead of a wedding gown.\n\n(Did anyone else catch when Dean yelled \u201cVICTORY!\u201d while he was waiting for Caelynn to formally break up with Connor?)\n\nNow that the dust has settled from Caelynn\u2019s completely ill-advised departure, the pressure is on the other couples to perform a completely meaningless but over-the-top romantic gesture to solidify a shaky relationship. First up is Katie and Chris! Katie has been feeling like Chris hasn\u2019t been giving her what she needs in the relationship, and she can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s actually into her, because that\u2019s where you want your relationship to be the week before you might get engaged. Katie and Chris get a date card, and they sit across from each other and just repeat the phrase \u201c100 percent\u201d to each other in place of words like \u201ccommitment\u201d and \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cintimacy.\u201d Chris says that he knows he doesn\u2019t know how to communicate with another adult about his feelings but he\u2019s 1,000 percent sure he\u2019s 100 percent all in.\n\nUp next, it\u2019s time for Demi and Kristian\u2019s check-in. This one is a bit tough, but ultimately it comes down to the fact that Demi choosing to come out on national television in a competitive dating reality show is causing her to freak out. Kristian\u2019s love language is \u201cphysical touch,\u201d and Demi\u2019s is \u201cbeing on television.\u201d Demi is uncomfortable that Kristian is exchanging platonic physical touches with straight women who have no interest in her. Demi\u2019s concern about Kristian\u2019s friendship arm touches evolves into Demi doubting if she\u2019s physically affectionate enough for Kristian and if Demi\u2019s friends think she\u2019s weird for being \u201cthat gay girl.\u201d Whoa whoa whoa. This is (a) a lot and (b) sounds like something for a therapist. There\u2019s a lot of stuff wound up in here, and most of it seems like Demi is actively reconciling what it\u2019s like to be an openly queer woman. On a very strange precolonial Mexican cleansing ritual date, she tries to parse exactly what Kristian needs to do to support her and the answer is \u2026 stop hugging her friends? Kristian tries to console her by saying that her hugging and touching their friends isn\u2019t romantic or sexual, and Demi says, \u201cI knew you would say that.\u201d Okay. WOW. Ultimately, Kristian is able to comfort Demi and they hug on a beach after being cleansed with burning herbs.\n\nBack at the resort, JPJ has decided to throw Tayshia a prom because she didn\u2019t go to prom and he cannot fathom a greater injustice than Tayshia having not gone to prom with a hot date. EVERYONE goes to prom, and if you didn\u2019t, you were a \u201cbookworm,\u201d according to JPJ. Tayshia squeals for three full hours as JPJ takes her to a daybed decorated with \u201cPROM\u201d balloons. Also, there\u2019s a saxophone player. Because nothing says \u201cAmerican Prom\u201d like a loose saxophone player.\n\nBlake watches JPJ and Tayshia and knows that he, too, has to do a completely over-the-top gesture in order to save his alleged \u201crelationship\u201d with Kristina. Blake is completely incapable of reading the damn room. He tries to playfully hug Kristina, and she tells him \u201cEASY.\u201d He tries to compliment her perfume, and she asks why he\u2019s smelling her. He gives her a date card, and she\u2019s like \u201c\u2026 What is this.\u201d\n\nThe entire issue with Blake is he\u2019s decided that he\u2019s supposed to end up with Kristina without any input from her. He\u2019s never had a meaningful conversation about what she wants in a relationship or if she\u2019s still attracted to him. He\u2019s internalized all the wrong messages from the Big story line on Sex and the City. You can be charmingly aloof with a woman until you decide you\u2019re ready to commit. And if she tries to deal with any of your bad behavior, she\u2019s being unreasonable because that was when you were being casual, baby. Blake knows that he\u2019s just got to remind Kristina that her heart wants Blake even if her mind, consciousness, sense of self, id, ego, and superego tell her that it\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nOf course, Kristina tells him that she just can\u2019t get there. She also says that she wanted to come to Paradise and help Blake find love and smile as he rode into the sunset with another woman. Okay, so we all being delusional, now? Cool.\n\nBlake breaks down and doesn\u2019t understand how or why Kristina wouldn\u2019t want to be with him. She was only his fifth option in Paradise and he repeatedly gaslit her and every other woman on the beach about his actions. They both choose to leave Paradise in separate vans. Blake says that this all feels like Karma. No, Blake, that\u2019s not karma. That\u2019s just a pattern of consequences for your actions that you refuse to change or examine. As Blake rides to the airport, he asks, \u201cI learned a lot but at what cost?\u201d Blake, what did you learn and what was the cost? A couple of ladies told you that you were kind of a dick. Imagine the toll this must be taking on his soul. If only he could do something \u2014 or anything \u2014 to prevent that from happening all over again.\n\nRemember when we all thought he was really cute and Becca should have picked him?\n\nSee you tomorrow!", "description": "Everyone in Paradise seems to think that it\u2019s the job of the other person in the relationship to fix all your problems.
