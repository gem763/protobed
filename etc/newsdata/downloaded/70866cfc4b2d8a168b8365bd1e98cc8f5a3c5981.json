Mr Justice Teare rejected the claim that New Balance had not acted in good faith when submitting the matching offer, which had been another element of Liverpool's case.\n\nNew Balance immediately applied for permission to appeal the judgment, but this was dismissed. An application for appeal could still be made to the Court of Appeal.\n\nLiverpool said they were 'pleased' with the decision and said they would continue to work with New Balance for the remainder of this season, when the contract expires, and would also be working with Nike on next season's kits.\n\nIt was ruled Liverpool could not expect New Balance to use 'global superstar athletes of the calibre of LeBron James and Serena Williams' to help promote the club and generate revenue\n\nGlobal music superstar Drake will also be used by Nike in their marketing of Liverpool", "description": "LAURA LAMBERT: Liverpool have won their High Court battle against New Balance, over a \u00a330m-a-year, five-year kit sponsorship deal from next season.", "authors": ["Laura Lambert For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/12/20176540-0-image-a-2_1572001839042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
