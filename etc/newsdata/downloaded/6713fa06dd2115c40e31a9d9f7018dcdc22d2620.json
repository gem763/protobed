Will Republicans let him get away with it?", "language": "en", "text": "Congressional Republicans have been terrified of Trump\u2019s 'base' long enough. Let them know they ought to be even more worried about the rest of us.\n\nAfter the last few weeks, you might think we\u2019re past the point of needing an impeachment investigation and need a family intervention instead. President Donald Trump and his often-deranged surrogates seems to have decided that if he is going to be impeached, it\u2019s going to be big league. Huge! The most beautiful impeachment ever!\n\nBut while there\u2019s a madness to Trump\u2019s method, there\u2019s a method nonetheless. It\u2019s the final act in the corruption of the Republican Party. Trump stood in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue and shot the Constitution, and now he\u2019s daring Republicans to call him on it. If they will not, he knows he will own them forever, no matter what he might do in the future.\n\nHis shamelessness has removed all ambiguity and shredded the usual fig leaves his supporters use to excuse his actions. He's not pretending that he didn't ask Ukraine to do opposition research for his 2020 campaign. He revels in it and thinks it's \"beautiful.\" He's not pretending that foreign governments aren't pouring money into his hotels in the hopes of buying some influence with him. Foreign leaders like Zelensky tell him so. He's not pretending that he's not doing his best to steer taxpayer dollars to his company and profit from his office, the very definition of corruption. He doesn't think there's anything wrong with that and he's outraged that political pressure forced him to move the G-7 from his Florida resort.\n\nRepublicans are now left with a simple choice. Do they swear eternal fealty to Trump and fully become his creatures, without hope of redemption or reprieve? Or do they stand up for the rule of law and principles, like the sanctity of U.S. elections, that they espoused until very recently?\n\nWhy sacrifice integrity for Trump?\n\nWhile they ponder this choice, they should consider what would happen if their project were somehow successful and Trump manages to finish his term and even get reelected. Should that occur, Trump will know that congressional Republicans will accept any outrage without demur. He will also be unconstrained by the prospect of the next election.\n\nIn other words, Republicans will look back with fond regret on the restrained and statesman-like President Trump of 2019. It\u2019s entirely possible that 2021 Trump will humiliate them just for his own amusement. Bullies often do. Is that really a future they are willing to accept?\n\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Donald Trump in New York on Sept. 25, 2019. (Photo: UKRAINE PRESIDENTIAL PRESS SERVICE / HANDOUT, EPA-EFE)\n\nPersonally, I cannot fathom why being in Congress would be worth sacrificing your last shreds of dignity and integrity while knowing that history will remember you with utter embarrassment. And yet, that\u2019s what many Republicans seem to be willing to do. Watching people I have admired for many years contradict themselves from one day to the next simply because Trump commands them to do so is immensely sad, not just for me, but for the country \u2014 and for them.\n\nWhatever they may think of his policies, it\u2019s hard to believe that most congressional Republicans are thrilled that their leader is a foul-mouthed troll \u2014 and a none-too-bright troll, at that. Do even the president\u2019s most committed congressional followers really believe that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201chates America?\u201d That\u2019s the way we used to talk about al-Qaida.\n\nRepublicans need more courage\n\nBy some estimates, 35 Republican senators would vote to remove Trump if there were a secret ballot. But there are far too many Republicans in the \u201cvote no, hope yes\u201d caucus. There are even more in the \u201ckeep your mouth shut and your head down\u201d caucus. This has to stop. These people can no longer free-ride on the political courage of the rest of the Republican Party, because there isn\u2019t any.\n\nBigger than the president: Impeachment isn't just about Trump. It's about stopping the Republicans who enabled him.\n\nTo grasp their final chance at redemption, congressional Republicans need not necessarily conclude that Trump must be impeached and removed from office. But they do need to stop considering their short-term political interests and start considering the country\u2019s long-term interests. Allowing a president to abuse his office for political and personal gain cannot be tolerated. American justice is impartial.\n\nWhen the president pushes anyone to investigate an American citizen, whether it\u2019s an attorney general or a foreign country, it\u2019s wrong. When the president does so for political gain and encourages a foreign country to interfere in an American election, it\u2019s doubly wrong. Republicans need to stand up and rebuke the president.\n\nNot a Netflix series or spectator sport\n\nIt\u2019s our duty to help congressional Republicans find the courage to do what needs to be done. The past few weeks have been nothing if not dramatic, but we\u2019re not binge watching a new Netflix series and this isn\u2019t a spectator sport. When history is written, what we did as individual citizens will matter too.\n\nMemo to GOP: Forget Donald Trump. Save Republicans for the sake of the party's future\n\nSo here is a thumbnail guide to political activism. Calling is better than writing. But writing a letter or sending an email is a lot better than doing nothing. It\u2019s easier to speak with someone by calling your representative\u2019s or senator\u2019s local office. But calling the Capitol switchboard and asking to be put through to your representative or senator\u2019s office is good, too. That number is (202)224-3121. You can also look up your representative\u2019s contact information at house.gov just by entering your Zip Code.\n\nWhen you call, give your representatives and senators a simple message: Say you are a constituent and you expect them to publicly tell President Trump that asking a foreign government to interfere with an American election is not \u201cbeautiful\u201d and that he should be ashamed of himself.\n\nCongressional Republicans have been terrified of Trump\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d long enough. It\u2019s time to let them know they ought to be even more worried about the rest of us.\n\nChris Truax, an appellate lawyer in San Diego, is an adviser to Republicans for the Rule of Law and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.\n\nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @usatodayopinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.
