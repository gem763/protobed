A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBut Mr Trump admitted this week that he had done some of what his own advisers feared, using the call to raise the Biden issue with Mr Zelensky.\n\nAnd the wave of consternation triggered by that call led someone in the US intelligence community to submit an extraordinary whistleblower complaint, setting in motion a sequence of events that now includes the start of an impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Where does he come from,\u201d Mr Trump tweeted this week.\n\nMr Trump\u2019s closest advisers, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was ordered by Mr Trump to suspend the aid to Ukraine, are also increasingly targets of internal finger-pointing.\n\nMr Mulvaney has agitated for foreign aid to be cut universally but has also stayed away from meetings with Mr Giuliani and the US president, officials said.\n\nBut the person who appears to have been more directly involved at nearly every stage of the entanglement with Ukraine is Mr Giuliani.\n\n\u201cRudy \u2013 he did all of this,\u201d one US official said. \u201cThis s***show that we\u2019re in \u2013 it\u2019s him injecting himself into the process.\u201d\n\nSeveral officials traced their initial concerns about the path of US-Ukrainian relations to news reports and interviews granted by Mr Giuliani in which he began to espouse views and concerns that did not appear connected to US priorities or policy.\n\nThe former New York mayor appears to have seen Mr Zelensky, a political neophyte elected president of Ukraine in April and sworn in in May, as a potential ally on two political fronts \u2013 punishing those Mr Giuliani suspected of playing a role in exposing the Ukraine-related corruption of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and delivering political ammunition against Mr Biden.\n\nAfter the conclusion of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Mr Giuliani turned his attention to Ukraine, officials said, and soon began pushing for personnel changes at the embassy while seeking meetings with Zelensky subordinates.\n\nHe also had his own emissaries in Ukraine who were meeting with officials, setting up meetings for him and sending back information that he could circulate in the United States.\n\nThe US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, became a primary Giuliani target.\n\nMs Yovanovitch, a longtime State Department Foreign Service officer, arrived in Ukraine as ambassador at the end of the Obama administration, more than two years after an uprising centred on Kiev\u2019s Independence Square ousted the Russian-leaning government.\n\nThough she was widely respected in the national security community for her efforts to prod Ukraine to take on corruption, Mr Giuliani targeted Ms Yovanovitch with wild accusations including that she played a secret role in exposing Mr Manafort and was part of a conspiracy orchestrated by the liberal financier George Soros.\n\n\u201cShe should be part of the investigation as part of the collusion,\u201d Mr Giuliani said in a recent interview with The Washington Post, adding that \u201cshe is now working for Soros.\u201d\n\nMs Yovanovitch is still employed by the State Department and is a fellow at Georgetown University. She declined to comment.\n\nMr Giuliani also said the entire State Department was a problem, and officials familiar with his actions say he regularly briefed Mr Trump on his Ukrainian endeavours. \u201cThe State Department is a bureaucracy that needs to change,\u201d he told The Washington Post.\n\nMany of Mr Giuliani\u2019s charges were either recycled from, or subsequently echoed by, right-wing media outlets.\n\nIn late March, the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr amplified this campaign with a tweet calling for the removal of \u201cObama\u2019s US Ambassador.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

protester holds a sign accusing the president of being a traitor Getty\n\nMs Yovanovitch, who was to depart in July after a three-year assignment, was prematurely ordered back to Washington, a move that both baffled and unnerved senior officials at the State Department and the White House, officials said.\n\nWithin days of her ouster on 9 May, Mr Giuliani seemed determined to seize an unsanctioned diplomatic role for himself, announcing plans to travel to Ukraine to push for investigations that would \u201cbe very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government\u201d.\n\nMr Giuliani cancelled the trip amid an ensuing backlash over his purpose but later met with one of Mr Zelensky\u2019s senior aides in Madrid and pressed the issue of Ukraine\u2019s helping against Mr Biden.\n\nIn a 19 May interview on Fox News, Mr Trump recited repeatedly disproved allegations that then-vice president Joe Biden had coerced Ukraine to drop an investigation into the owner of an energy company, Burisma, for which Mr Biden\u2019s son, Hunter was a board member.\n\nThe allegations were baseless. Though Hunter Biden had served on the Burisma board for five years \u2013 a questionable decision given his father\u2019s influential position \u2013 he was never accused of any wrongdoing by Ukrainian authorities.\n\nThe probe had been shelved before any action by the vice president, and the elder Biden\u2019s efforts involved removing a prosecutor widely criticised by the West as failing to tackle corruption.\n\nNevertheless, Mr Trump is alleged to have used his 25 July call with Mr Zelensky to get Ukraine to revive this dormant inquiry and widen it to include possible wrongdoing by Mr Biden.\n\nIn Washington, officials outside Mr Trump\u2019s inner circle who were dismayed by Ms Yovanovitch\u2019s ouster reacted with growing alarm and confusion over Mr Giuliani\u2019s subsequent activities.\n\nThen-national security adviser John Bolton was outraged by the outsourcing of a relationship with a country struggling to survive Russian aggression, officials said.\n\nBut by then his standing with Mr Trump was strained, and neither he nor his senior aides could get straight answers about Mr Giuliani\u2019s agenda or authority, officials said. Mr Bolton declined to comment.\n\nMr Giuliani told The Washington Post that one of his calls with a top Ukrainian aide was partially arranged by Kurt Volker, a State Department official, and that he briefed the department afterward.\n\n\u201cWe had the same visibility as anybody else \u2013 watching Giuliani on television,\u201d a former senior official said.\n\nOfficials at the US Embassy in Kiev were similarly deprived of information, even as they faced questions from Ukrainians about whether Mr Giuliani was a designated representative.\n\n\u201cThe embassy didn\u2019t know what to do with the outreach,\u201d said senator Chris Murphy, who travelled to Ukraine this month.\n\nIn a Tuesday interview on Fox News, Mr Giuliani said he had been enlisted by the State Department to intervene on the Ukraine matter.\n\n\u201cYou know who I did it at the request of? The State Department,\u201d he said, holding up his cellphone to indicate that call records would back up his claim.\n\nHe also said that he began pursuing the issue in late 2018 after a visit from an investigator he did not identify.\n\nThe perception of a parallel, hidden agenda intensified in the summer as officials at the NSC, Pentagon and State Department began reacting to rumours that hundreds of millions of dollars of military and intelligence aid to Ukraine was being mysteriously impeded.\n\n\u201cThere were never any orders given, any formal guidance from the White House to any of the agencies,\u201d said a US official familiar with the matter. \u201cAnd the NSC was scratching their heads: How is this possible?\u201d\n\nNSC officials, including Tim Morrison, who had replaced Fiona Hill as the senior director for European and Russian affairs, began organising meetings to try to understand these hidden forces affecting Ukraine policy, officials said.\n\nBut even then, clear answers proved elusive. Officials were told that the money was being blocked by the Office of Management and Budget, without any accompanying explanation.\n\n\u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d the official said.\n\nA former official familiar with the meetings said participants began to file out raising troubling questions about what was driving the White House to withhold the aid as well as a meeting with Mr Trump that had been all but promised to Mr Zelensky.\n\nAlthough the question of a linkage or leverage never came up in the formal NSC discussions, participants began to believe that Mr Trump was \u201cwithholding the aid until [Ukraine] gave him something on Biden or Manafort.\u201d\n\nIt was during this stretch, in July, when some officials began to hesitate about the wisdom of proceeding with a Trump call with Mr Zelensky.\n\nIn part, there was a desire to hold off until after Ukraine\u2019s parliamentary elections.\n\nBut, mindful of Mr Giuliani\u2019s agitation and influence, some worried that even if he were coached before the call, Mr Trump would not be able to resist pressing the Ukrainian president for dirt on Mr Biden.\n\nOn 24 July, Mr Mueller testified before congress on the outcome of the Russia investigation, a probe that had threatened Mr Trump for much of his presidency and was focused on whether he had conspired with Moscow to influence the US election.\n\nThe next day, Mr Trump spoke with Mr Zelensky on a call, and the vague misgivings that had risen over the preceding five months hardened into alarm.\n\nAmong those who listened in on the call or were in position to see a transcript, the president\u2019s persistence with Mr Zelensky on the corruption probe marked the crossing of a perilous threshold.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to pressure the leader of Ukraine followed a months-long fight inside the administration that sidelined national security officials and empowered political loyalists \u2013 including the president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani \u2013 to exploit the US\u00a0relationship with Kiev, current and former US\u00a0officials said.", "authors": ["Greg Miller", "Josh Dawsey", "Paul Sonne", "Ellen Nakashima"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/08/trump-giuliani.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
