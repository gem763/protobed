We also have an Alsace riesling to match hearty fall dishes, a Bordeaux to illustrate the importance of vintage, and a bubbly ros\u00e9 to get the party started.\n\nGREAT VALUE\n\nLa Salette 2018\n\nCotes de Gascogne, France, $9\n\nGascony grows most of its grapes for distillation into brandy, but the table wines can be delicious and cheap. This juicy white blend is 80 percent colombard, familiar to wine drinkers of a certain age as the mainstay grape of American chablis. The rest is gros manseng and ugni blanc. You won\u2019t want to waste time contemplating this crowd pleaser, because you\u2019ll want to snag another pour before it\u2019s gone.

This wine is dry, so riesling-phobes who shy away thinking it\u2019s always sweet should feel confident enough to give it a try.

Many Bordeaux are arriving on the market from the fabulous 2016 vintage, and here\u2019s an early entry (the first I\u2019ve seen), from the troublesome rainy 2017s. I encourage anyone just learning about wine, or curious about why we should pay attention to vintage, to try this against a similarly priced 2016. The 2017 Peynaud-Bagnac, a blend of 65 percent merlot, 30 percent cabernet sauvignon and 5 percent cabernet franc, is textbook Bordeaux, with black fruit flavors and a mineral note commonly called graphite or pencil shavings. It\u2019s medium-bodied and somewhat angular, while a 2016 is likely to be riper and more mouthfilling. The 2017s will be a vintage to enjoy while waiting for the 2016s to develop in the cellar, even at this price level.
