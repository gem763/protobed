Apple just added a third camera to the back of the fanciest iPhones to encourage you to upgrade. As a camera guy, I can tell you three lenses are better than one. But this \u201ctriPhone\u201d will cost you $1,000 \u2014 or more.\n\n\n\nCEO Tim Cook presents the new iPhone 11 Pro. (Stephen Lam/Reuters)\n\nI had a chance to try the new iPhones after Apple\u2019s launch event Tuesday. Figuring out whether to buy a new iPhone always requires sorting through marketing mumbo jumbo. Is it a legit upgrade \u2026 or just another upsell? This year\u2019s crop of iPhones, arriving in stores Sept. 20, offers some of the most incremental improvements I\u2019ve ever seen from Apple. However, there are also ways to avoid overpaying for features you don\u2019t really need.\n\nTo make matters more confusing, Apple monkeyed around with the names of the new stuff. So let\u2019s rewind:\n\nThe $700 iPhone 11 is the 2019 entry-level model, the successor to the iPhone XR. It also has a 6.1-inch screen. There are just two lenses in the back and a slightly less high-end screen technology.\n\nThe $1,000 iPhone 11 Pro is the 2019 flagship model, replacing the iPhone XS. It also has a 5.8-inch screen. This is the phone that sprouted the third lens.\n\nThe $1,100 iPhone 11 Pro Max (can you believe this awful name) is the big boy. It\u2019s a 6.5-inch screen version of the 11 Pro, the replacement to the iPhone XS Max.\n\nAnd the iPhone XR, the hit iPhone of 2018, is still around and now priced at just $600.\n\n\n\nApple's 2019 lineup of iPhones. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News)\n\nIf you\u2019re currently using an iPhone 6, 6S or 7 \u2014 which covers about half of the globe\u2019s iPhone owners, according to research firm Sensor Tower \u2014 any of the four phones above is going to feel like a major upgrade. They all have larger screens, better battery life, better cameras, faster processors and Face ID instead of the fingerprint reader.\n\nFor most people, the XR is a fabulous choice at that new price, lowered from $750 last year. (You can save even more by buying a refurbished model, and the earth will also love you.) The nerds might call an XR the \u201ccheap\u201d iPhone \u2014 I call it the \u201cI spent half as much and flew to Hawaii instead\u201d iPhone.\n\n[Help Desk: Ask our tech columnist a question]\n\nIf you crank it up to iPhone 11 instead, what do you get? A fair amount of upsell: You\u2019ll get a processor that feels just slightly faster (but might make the phone last longer), stronger glass (that you still shouldn\u2019t drop on concrete), and Face ID that might work even when the phone is flat on a table. Apple claims the battery on the 11 Pro lasts four hours longer than last year\u2019s laggard iPhone XS. And there are some new colors with names like \u201cmidnight green\u201d \u2014 like green, but darker.\n\n\n\nThe iPhone 11 has just two back lenses and comes in new colors. (Tony Avelar/AP)\n\nStill, you won\u2019t get some features rival Android phones have. You can\u2019t wirelessly charge headphones on the back of the phone. The screen doesn\u2019t fold up to fit in your pocket. There\u2019s no support for ultrafast 5G. And don\u2019t hold your breath about ever getting back a headphone jack \u2014 that\u2019s how they upsell AirPods.\n\nDespite all that, the No. 1 selling point of the iPhone 11 is the camera. There is a set of people, myself included, who use their phone more as a camera than as a phone. For us, the prospect of a significantly better camera is a big deal.\n\nHow much better is this camera? Let\u2019s zoom into the details, because I\u2019m not yet convinced it\u2019s $1,000 better.\n\n\n\nColumnist Geoffrey A. Fowler tries making a \"slofie\" \u2014 a slow-motion selfie \u2014 on Apple's new iPhone 11 Pro. (James Pace-Cornsilk/The Washington Post)\n\nThe front-facing camera on all of the 11 models is capable of slow-motion selfies, or what Apple is really hoping people will call \u201cslofies.\u201d I can report these look great on anyone with long hair and a fan, not so great on people with prominent cheeks like yours truly.\n\nAll the iPhone 11s also have \u2014 at long last \u2014 a night mode that helps you get shots without a flash in dim restaurants, on moonlight vistas and other places you have fun in the dark. Apple\u2019s description of the technology was vague, but it sounds like it stitches together multiple shots like the Night Sight mode on Google\u2019s Pixel phones. The verdict is still out whether Apple\u2019s version is as impressive.\n\nAnd this brings us to all the lenses making the back of phones look like beehives. High-end iPhones have come with two back lenses since 2016, typically one for regular wide shots and another for two-times zoom.\n\n\n\nApple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller, on stage at Apple's launch event, describes the iPhone 11 Pro's three-lens camera system. (Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe entry-level iPhone 11 includes a second lens missing in the XR \u2014 but it adds ultrawide shots, not zoom. This is a disappointment: Ultrawide angle is useful if you\u2019re Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars or trying to wrangle your own large group of friends into a photo. Ultrawide is one step before fish-eye. But in my life, I much more often want to zoom in \u2014 to a concert, sunset or other attraction in the distance. The iPhone 11 doesn\u2019t help there.\n\nThe lens count notches up to three on the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. They\u2019re buried inside a square glass bulge, which sadly makes the phone lie unevenly on a table. (A case could help with that.)\n\nSo what makes three eyes better than two? To start with, now you can take regular wide, zoom and ultrawide shots. The iPhone interface makes switching between them feel as smooth as turning a dial. Giving a photographer more lenses is like giving a painter more colors, and I\u2019m sure it will unleash a lot of new creativity in iPhonography. But again here, I would have wanted even more zoom over an ultrawide angle option.\n\n\n\nThe FiLMiC app's Christopher Cohen, right, and filmmaker Sean Baker, left, explain how FiLMiC Pro records video from all of the iPhone 11 Pro's cameras simultaneously. (Tony Avelar/AP)\n\nIn one demonstration, Apple showed how a video-recording app could capture input from all three lenses \u2014 plus the one on the front \u2014 at the same time. Imagine filming someone and capturing their face, as well as your own, all at once.\n\nApple didn\u2019t show that capability for still photos. And when I tried taking shots, it only kept an image from a single lens, not all three.\n\nSuper camera buffs will also be interested in one more thing Apple promises is coming eventually through a software upgrade. A mode called \u201cDeep Fusion\u201d will use artificial intelligence to boost the detail and range of tones in your photos. Here\u2019s how it works: The iPhone takes four long-exposure and four short-exposure photos before you press the shutter \u2014 and then another longer one when you press the button. Then the phone merges them into one, keeping just the sharpest details, with the least amount of \u201cnoise\u201d from the camera sensor. Apple executive Phil Schiller called it \u201ccomputational photography mad science.\u201d\n\n\n\nApple shared this sample photograph taken using its \"Deep Fusion\" technique, coming to the iPhone 11 Pro in a software update. (Tony Avelar/AP)\n\nThis sounds fascinating, and it\u2019s further evidence that our photos are \u201cfake\u201d now \u2014 generated by computers to produce the most pleasing images.\n\nBut we don\u2019t really know yet how good these iPhone 11 shots will look. Apple is no longer the hands-down camera leader. Samsung already sells a phone with four (!) back lenses, the Galaxy S10 5G. And Huawei\u2019s P30 Pro has a five-times optical lens that telescopes inside the phone.\n\nIn the days ahead, Apple will undoubtedly show off pretty photos taken by hand-selected photographers and the company\u2019s special friends. But if you\u2019re considering spending your hard-earned savings on an iPhone just for the camera, I\u2019d recommend waiting until independent photographers and journalists like yours truly have had a chance to test these features in the real world.\n\nRead more tech advice and analysis from Geoffrey A.
