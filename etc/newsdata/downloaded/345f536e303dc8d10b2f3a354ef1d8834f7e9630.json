Retuning. Working hard.\"\n\nHe even produced a glorious chip over goalkeeper Bernd Leno to score that showed he hasn't lost any of his strikers instinct.\n\nArsenal will be buoyed by his return as they bid to keep pace with top two Liverpool and Man City.\n\nThe Gunners have managed to keep results ticking over without Lacazette in the side, and remain unbeaten since losing him to an ankle problem.\n\nThere is slight pressure on Unai Emery's men to get a result at Bramall Lane however, after they slipped out of the top four due to wins for Leicester and Chelsea .\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\nA win would see Arsenal move back up to third, but Sheffield United could prove a tricky test.\n\nThe Blades caused league leaders Liverpool several problems during their clash at the end of last month, with the Reds fortunate to come away from the tie with all three points.\n\nBut defender David Luiz feels the club can use the fixture to show their credentials and believes Arsenal can challenge for the title.\n\nLuiz told NBC Sports: \"For me, if you start something, and we've just started the Premier League and all of the competitions, if you don't think you can win the competition then you won't start anything in your life.\n\n\"I want to win titles with Arsenal. I want to improve and adapt myself for the style of Arsenal, as a club and how the manager wants us to play. I think we can do that together.\n\n\"My vision, my ambition and my will is always to fight for the title and between the club, the players and the coach, we have the possibility to fight for the title. I think this club deserves to shine again.\"", "description": "The French forward has not featured for the Gunners since the draw with Tottenham at the beginning of last month", "authors": ["Darren Wells", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20659572.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Arsenal-v-Burnley.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
