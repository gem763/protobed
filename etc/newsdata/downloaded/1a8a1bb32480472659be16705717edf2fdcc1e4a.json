(AMZN.O), Facebook Inc (FB.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O), and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google (GOOGL.O), widening the antitrust probe of Big Tech.\n\nThe letters seek by Oct. 14 internal emails over the last decade from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet CEO Larry Page, among others, about acquisitions.\n\nApple shares fell about 1.8% after the market opened. While Apple had been mentioned as a potential target, the House letter offered the first concrete evidence of a wide-ranging antitrust investigation.\n\nApple has faced criticism that its App Store\u2019s policies and algorithms support its own products and stifle third-party applications.\n\nOn Monday, the Texas attorney general led a group of 50 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories in a probe of whether Google abuses its market power in advertising.\n\n\u201cThere is growing evidence that a handful of corporations have come to capture an outsized share of online commerce and communications,\u201d said House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, who signed the letters along with Ranking Republican Representative Doug Collins and Representative David Cicilline, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee and ranking Republican Jim Sensenbrenner.\n\n\u201cThis information is key in helping determine whether anticompetitive behavior is occurring, whether our antitrust enforcement agencies should investigate specific issues and whether or not our antitrust laws need improvement to better promote competition in the digital markets,\u201d Collins said in a statement.\n\nThe lawmakers seek emails from senior executives on topics including acquisitions like Amazon\u2019s purchase of AbeBooks, PillPack, Eero, Ring, Zappos and Whole Foods; and Google\u2019s acquisition of AdMob, YouTube, Android and DoubleClick.\n\nThey also seek information on various policies including Google\u2019s decision to automatically sign into Chrome any user to logs into any Google service.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Amazon and Facebook declined to comment. Google referred to a blog post this week that said its services \u201ccreate choice for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe committee requested information from the companies\u2019 executives on market share, competitors, their largest customers for specific products and documents from other investigations.\n\nIt asked Apple for information on App Store concerns such as the decision to remove some parental control apps and its policy regarding whether iPhone users can set non-Apple apps as defaults.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The logos of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google in a combination photo from Reuters files./File Photo\n\nThe committee seeks communications on Facebook\u2019s purchase of Instagram, WhatsApp and Onavo and its decisions to integrate Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and to cut off apps from its social graph.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department said in July it is investigating \u201cwhether and how\u201d large tech companies in \u201csearch, social media, and some retail services online\u201d are engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Google said it received a formal request for documents from the Justice Department in late August.", "description": "A U.S. House of Representatives panel on Friday demanded internal emails, detailed financial information and other company records from top executives of Amazon.com Inc. , Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , and Alphabet Inc's Google , widening the antitrust probe of Big Tech.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429472692&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C17K", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
