Last year when my wife and I attended we knew that we were expecting our first child, no one else knew, but we did.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s voice broke and he appeared close to tears as he stepped back from the lectern. Host Gaby Roslin stepped forward and patted his arm to comfort him.\n\nAfter a few seconds during which he composed himself, Harry went on, \u201cI remember squeezing Meghan\u2019s hand so tight during the awards and both of us thinking what it would be like to be parents one day, and more so what it would be like to protect and help our child should they be born with immediate challenges or become unwell over time.\n\n\u201cAnd now talking to all of you as a parent pulls at my heart strings, in a way I never could have understood, until I had a child of my own. No parent wants to hear that their child will suffer, that they will face extraordinary challenges that will affect them throughout their lives.\n\n\u201cAfter meeting all the WellChild kids and parents over the years you have managed to give us a sense of optimism, of hope and of strength that no professional, no bestselling book or advice could ever give us, so thank you for being you.\u201d\n\nThe emotional breakdown comes after reports that Harry and Meghan have given a fresh on-camera interview to their friend, journalist Tom Bradby, in which they will \u201c lay bare the world of pressure and pain behind the brave faces.\u201d\n\nBradby said the special, to be screened on Sunday night, will follow Meghan and Harry\u2019s recent tour of Africa which was overshadowed by an extraordinary statement from Harry in which he attacked the press as and alleged a campaign of \u201crelentless propaganda\u201d against his wife.\n\nHarry announced that Meghan was to sue the Mail on Sunday and days later added that he was suing the Sun and the Mirror over \u00adallegations of phone hacking.\n\nBradby said of making the film: \u201cIt was a journey but not always the one I was expecting. The story of their time was of passion for their work private happiness but also a world of pressure and pain behind the brave faces.\u201d", "description": "Harry\u2019s public display of emotion comes after it was revealed Harry and Meghan will discuss the \u201cworld of pressure and pain\u201d they face in a new documentary.", "authors": ["Tom Sykes"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_576,w_1024,x_0,y_59/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571211480/GettyImages-1176059236_cpqbwj", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
