(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nFollow our live analysis throughout Game 3 between the Washington Nationals and Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nFirst inning (in progress \u2014 Nationals 0, Dodgers 0):\n\nAn\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez worked his way into a jam in the first inning against the Dodgers \u2014 just as he did back on July 26, in his only other start against them this season in Nationals Park. S\u00e1nchez walked two and allowed a single before locking in to strike out A.J. Pollock with a 71-mph butterfly change-up to escape. Nationals Park got loud, and the team on the field hopes S\u00e1nchez can repeat the dominance from July 26 too, when he later retired 20 Dodgers in a row.\n\nPregame:\n\n7:43 p.m.: The Nationals public-address system let loose a name it\u2019s done thousands of times before: \u201cRyannnnn Zimmerm-mannnnn!\u201d Nationals Park lost it. He wasn\u2019t in the starting lineup, he hasn\u2019t delivered a clutch hit this series or done something to change the trajectory of the season, but the crowd knew that every day cheering him might be their last, due to his uncertain contract. So, they roared for the franchise cornerstone, roared for him louder than anyone but maybe star pitcher Stephen Strasburg, who\u2019s been nails in the playoffs. It was a moment that made you remember what Nationals Park could be like, a hint of what it could be if this game goes as the Nationals hope it might.\n\nNLDS Game 3: Los Angeles Dodgers at Washington Nationals (tied 1-1)\n\nWhen: Sunday, 7:45 p.m.\n\nWhere: Nationals Park in Washington\n\nTV: TBS | Stream: TBS.com\n\nStarting pitchers: Hyun-jin Ryu (14-5, 2.32 ERA) vs. An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez (11-8, 3.85 ERA)\n\nThe Washington Nationals will be without their starting center fielder \u2014 at least to start Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nVictor Robles\u2019s MRI on Saturday revealed a mild right hamstring strain, and Manager Dave Martinez decided to hold the 22-year-old out of the starting lineup. The Nationals will instead go with veteran Michael A. Taylor, who spent most of this season in Class AA Harrisburg but seemed to rebound in September with the big league club. Martinez said Robles is available to pinch-hit in an emergency.\n\n\u201cWe all know how Victor plays, he wanted to play today,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cBut I really believe that it\u2019s best that we get him treatment, and he\u2019s going to try to ride the bike and run a little bit today and see how he feels.\u201d\n\nRobles tweaked his right hamstring trying to leg out a sacrifice bunt in the eighth inning of Game 2 on Friday night. He advanced Ryan Zimmerman to third base and, ultimately, helped him score an important insurance run in the 4-2 victory. The Nationals\u2019 rookie center field with relentless energy is a loss, but Taylor will hope to continue hitting and maintain his elite defense to show the team it hasn\u2019t lost much.\n\nNationals start An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez instead of Max Scherzer\n\nThe Washington Nationals will start An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez in Game 3 with a chance to take their first lead of this National League Division Series with a win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The team\u2019s ace, Max Scherzer, was slated to start, but after his dramatic relief appearance in the Game 2 victory, Scherzer was seemingly unable to throw on his regular start day. Manager Dave Martinez has expressed confidence in his fourth starter all season \u2014 asserting he had a \u201cBig Four,\u201d not a Big Three \u2014 and this is now S\u00e1nchez\u2019s biggest test.\n\nSunday was supposed to be Scherzer\u2019s start day on regular rest. He last started Tuesday, and his surprise appearance in the eighth inning of Game 2 came three days afterward, meaning he was scheduled to throw a side session that day anyway. Scherzer struck out all three batters he faced, and he did it on 14 pitches, but the appearance was higher leverage than any side session and apparently compromised his availability to start Game 3.\n\nThis decision creates some mystery as to how the Nationals will now use their remaining starters \u2014 Patrick Corbin, Stephen Strasburg and Scherzer \u2014 for the rest of the series. The Nationals will likely start two of them (if it goes to Game 5) and use one in the bullpen because, as Scherzer\u2019s relief appearance in Game 2 showed, they do not trust any of their bullpen arms in high-leverage situations beyond Sean Doolittle or Daniel Hudson. Scherzer seems the logical starter for Monday\u2019s Game 4 and Stephen Strasburg for a potential Game 5 on regular rest. This means the Nationals could use left-hander Patrick Corbin out of the bullpen to either match up with lefties, as Doolittle did in the seventh inning of Game 2, or in the Scherzer-esque setup role. It seems somewhat more likely the Nationals might match up Corbin with lefties because of Doolittle\u2019s comfort in higher-leverage roles toward the back-end of games.\n\nBut the Nationals, right now, are focused on S\u00e1nchez. This nod would have seemed impossible in the middle of May, as the veteran right-hander struggled to start this season with an ERA ballooning to 5.10. He hit the injured list with a hamstring strain and the team wondered if it might need a new fourth starter. S\u00e1nchez returned two weeks later and transformed into a skid-stopper and streak-starter. He finished the season strong with a 3.42 ERA over 123 2/3 innings. One of his most impressive outings came against the Dodgers in Washington on July 26, when he struggled in the top of the first inning then settled in to retire 20 in a row. He departed having allowed one run on three hits across seven innings.\n\nThe Nationals would like more of that. They need the length to spare the bullpen\u2019s high-leverage innings and the quality to keep pace with Dodgers\u2019 starter Hyun-jin Ryu, who was a National League Cy Young candidate for much of the season. The left-hander has an effective five pitch mix which mostly features a change-up (27.5 percent of the time), four-seam fastball (27.3), cutter (19.4), sinker (13.3) and curve (12.2). The Nationals need to get to Ryu early and hope S\u00e1nchez can replicate his magic against the Dodgers from earlier this season.\n\nLineups\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n\nJoc Pederson RF\n\nMax Muncy 1B\n\nJustin Turner 3B\n\nCody Bellinger CF\n\nCorey Seager SS\n\nA.J.
