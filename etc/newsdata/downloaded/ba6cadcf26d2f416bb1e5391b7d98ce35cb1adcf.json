But cameras posted above Earth also make plenty of scientific contributions.\n\nThey allow scientists to measure oncoming storms and the extent of the flooding that follows. They help lead researchers to animal life in places that are hard to monitor or explore on land \u2014 such as Antarctica, where researchers can use satellite imagery to track penguin colonies using the brown color of their guano trails. And they capture the ebb and flow of animal and plant life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nEpisode 1 of the series, \u201cMoving Planet,\u201d is filled with gorgeous imagery and breathtaking views. One of its highlights is footage of the 2017 solar eclipse taken from high-altitude weather balloons launched by schoolchildren and college students across the United States. (Not all satellite footage involves rockets.)\n\nThe live, near-space views of the eclipse flip traditional eclipse imagery on its head. Suddenly, the eclipse isn\u2019t the sun disappearing behind the black disc of the Moon\u2019s shadow \u2014 it\u2019s the sweep of that shadow across the landscape. And imagery from the International Space Station shows the enormous shadow\u2019s trajectory across the entire country, illustrating the scale of the celestial body.\n\nWhether you watch for the scientific tidbits or just the pretty pictures of the planet, \u201cLife From Above\u201d offers plenty of eye candy \u2014 and a refreshing bit of perspective thanks to cameras that literally rise above daily life.\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cLife From Above\u201d shows how such imagery contributes to the study of weather, environment, geology and other fields.", "authors": ["Erin Blakemore"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/NU24wJSk72TN47e3ITbHmznL5t0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TLGHLYXRWMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
