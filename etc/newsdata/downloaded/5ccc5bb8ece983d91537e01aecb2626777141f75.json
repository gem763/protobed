We simply had the courage to stand up and say something\u2014but in the end it\u2019s our voices no one can hear. Because of our NDAs, we can never say what is factually correct or incorrect about what happened to us at Fox.\u201d\n\nCarlson\u2019s case was settled in 2016 and is now the subject of the forthcoming film Bombshell, which tells the story of the women who facilitated Ailes\u2019 takedown at Fox. The executive\u2019s two-decade rule over Fox News came to a swift end weeks after Carson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit in July 2016.\n\nThe push among former Fox staffers for the company to lift their NDAs follows criticism of NBC\u2019s Friday announcement from Time\u2019s Up CEO Tina Tchen, who called for the network to lift all NDAs, rather than require employees to make specific requests.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Vanity Fair", "description": "Following NBC's announcement that it will release employees from non-disclosure agreements, former Fox staffers are asking the network to do the same.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Fox-News.jpg?fit=1133%2C800", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
