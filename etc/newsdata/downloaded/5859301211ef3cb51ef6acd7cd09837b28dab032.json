We\u2019re not fighting. We\u2019re policing,\u201d he tweeted on Monday.\n\nBut senior Republicans criticised the decision, with even staunch ally Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority leader, saying: \u201cA precipitous withdrawal of US forces from Syria would only benefit Russia, Iran, and the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nIran, a key backer of the Syrian government, also said on Tuesday it opposed any military action by Turkey.\n\nIn a call to Ankara, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif \u201curged respect for Syria\u2019s territorial integrity\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Safe zone\u2019 \u2013\n\nAnkara says it wants to establish a \u201csafe zone\u201d on the Syrian side of the border where it could send back some of the 3.6 million refugees from the eight-year civil war.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Monday that the operation into Syria could \u201ccome any night without warning,\u201d while Kurds in the area girded for fighting.\n\nKurds argue that Ankara\u2019s goal is to dilute their dominance in the region with an influx of mostly Sunni Arab refugees now living in southwestern Turkey.\n\nTrump\u2019s announcement appeared to have caught many US officials by surprise, and they spent Monday seeking to discourage Ankara from acting.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman warned Turkey of destabilizing blowback to the region if it invades.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2014 as did the president \u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nSDF spokesman Mustefa Bali said Washington\u2019s decision \u201cis about to ruin the trust and cooperation between the SDF and US.\u201d\n\nA Turkish attack raised the specter of some 10,000 Islamic State fighters currently held by the SDF being let loose if SDF soldiers have to battle Turkish troops.\n\nAround 2,000 of them are IS \u201cforeign fighters\u201d, and Trump assailed US allies in Europe for not taking back their nationals.\n\nIf they escape or are released, they could reconstitute the Islamic State, less than one year after it was defeated and its \u201ccaliphate\u201d disintegrated.\n\nTrump declared that it would be the responsibility of Turkey and other countries to deal with the IS prisoners.\n\n\u201cTurkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u2018neighborhood,\u2019\u201d he said, using another acronym for the jihadists.\n\nburs-er/txw", "description": "Istanbul (AFP) \u2013 Turkey said Tuesday it was ready for an offensive against Kurdish militants in northern Syria despite mixed signals from US", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/a153ab_turkey-it-establish-safe-zone-on-syrian-border-turkey-syria-offensive-mixed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
