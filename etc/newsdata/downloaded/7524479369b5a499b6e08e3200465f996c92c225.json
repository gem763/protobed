But a bigger story is being missed.", "language": "en", "text": "Wrong on all counts.\n\nInstead, we\u2019ve gotten a schoolyard brawl. After the Fed\u2019s decision last week to cut its key lending rate (the Fed funds rate on overnight loans among banks) by a quarter of a percentage point (to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent), apparently not enough for Trump, the president unleashed one of his furious tirades. \u201cJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cNo \u2018guts,\u2019 no sense, no vision!\u201d\n\nPreviously, Trump had called Powell a \u201cbonehead\u201d and an \u201cenemy\u201d of the country, comparing him to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Just about the only thing Trump hasn\u2019t done is insult Powell\u2019s mother. But who knows what happens next?\n\nAll this makes good copy and, perversely, contributes to widespread uncertainty that weakens the economy. There is no mystery about Trump\u2019s game. He is setting up Powell and the Fed as scapegoats should the economy slow sharply or fall into a recession.\n\nYet, beyond these political theatrics, there is a more complicated story that is largely being missed. The Fed may be approaching \u2014 or may have already reached \u2014 the limits of its economic powers. Over recent decades, we (meaning politicians, public officials, institutional investors, pundits and economists) have assumed that the Fed had enormous powers to direct and shape the \u00adeconomy.\n\nParadoxically, the Fed\u2019s reputation benefited from its role in preventing the 2008-2009 financial crisis from turning into a second Great Depression. The Fed flooded the economy with cash. This rescued some large financial institutions, even though the Fed was also complicit in the complacency that caused the crisis in the first place.\n\nRecall the basic model by which the Fed supposedly manages the economy. It raises or lowers the interest rate on fed funds, which are overnight loans largely among banks. If the economy is lackluster, it lowers rates to stimulate borrowing and spending. The decline in the fed funds rate theoretically causes rates to fall on home mortgages, corporate bonds, consumer loans and other forms of credit that affect the economy. Similarly, if inflation is too high, the Fed raises rates to slow the economy and dampen price \u00adincreases.\n\nThis, of course, is a highly simplified version of what happens or, at least, what\u2019s supposed to happen. But what if these assumptions are only partially true or, at times, not true at all?\n\nThen the Fed\u2019s influence on the economy is overstated. So concludes a new study by economists Alan M. Taylor of the University of California at Davis and \u00d2scar Jord\u00e0 of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. They examined interest rates from 1955 to 2018 for four major countries: the United States, Japan, Germany and Britain. They found that \u201cinterest rate setting is driven by factors outside policymakers\u2019 control.\u201d\n\nThe economists add: \u201cIn this paper we show that global forces set the course of interest rates over the medium to long run. This happens to a degree perhaps insufficiently appreciated.\u201d The Fed is important, but it\u2019s not omnipotent.\n\nThe economists attribute about 40 percent of interest rate changes to deliberate policy decisions by central banks and most of the remaining 60 percent to various long-term factors. The understanding of interest rates and credit conditions requires a global viewpoint and not, as is often assumed, mainly a domestic one, the economists argue.\n\nAlthough they don\u2019t say much about what those factors might be (more research!), plausible candidates include: inflation, both high and low; demographic shifts \u2014 younger or older populations; changes in savings and investment behavior; technological changes; the rise of China and other \u201cemerging market\u201d countries; and large-scale global capital flows \u2014 mass movement of money among countries.\n\nThe Trump-Powell feud shows no signs of abating. Trump may even call for an overhaul of the Fed to centralize more power in his hands. This would be undesirable, but even if he succeeds, Trump might discover that some of the powers he so covets have already moved offshore.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.\n\nRead more:\n\nDavid Wilcox: Should the Fed enable Trump\u2019s destructive trade policies?\n\nRobert J.
