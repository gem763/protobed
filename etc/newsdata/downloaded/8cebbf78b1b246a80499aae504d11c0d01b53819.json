I said that it was likely to test back down to retrace at least half of the rally. The overnight selloff has accomplished this minimum objective.\n\nTraders are still not sure if the rally was a bear flag or the 1st leg up in a 2 legged reversal. They will get information over the next few days that will help them decide. If today\u2019s selloff continues for 2 \u2013 3 days, the odds will favor a new low. But if tomorrow forms a reversal day, traders will expect a 2nd leg up to the August 26 lower high.\n\nEvery bottom attempt for the past year failed. As a result, traders expect every 2 \u2013 3 week rally to form a lower high and then lead to another new low.\n\nOvernight Forex trading\n\nI said yesterday that the bears had a micro double top at the EMA on the daily chart and that there would probably be a test of the September 3 buy signal bar high. The 5 minute chart has been selling off in a tight bear channel overnight and it is near that target.\n\nWhen a selloff is in a tight bear channel, day traders will only sell. They sell for scalps or swings. Since the selloff is near the support of the September 3 buy signal bar high, there is probably not much left to the bear trend today. Consequently, the bears will begin to take some profits. In addition, they will switch from selling at the market to selling 20 \u2013 30 pip bounces. This should convert the tight bear channel into a trading range.\n\nOnce the bulls believe the chart is beginning to enter a trading range, they will look to buy reversals up for 10 pip scalps.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Al Brooks covering: EUR/USD.
