But neither is expected to get the 50% plus one vote needed to win outright and avoid a runoff in November.\n\nWith the Broad Front at the helm, Uruguay has seen significant economic growth. Poverty has dropped dramatically, to 8.1%, while the legalization of gay marriage, abortion, and the sale of marijuana in pharmacies has strengthened the country's reputation as a trailblazer in the region.\n\n\"Even though I'm a Christian and I'm not in favor of things like legalizing abortion, I'm voting for the Broad Front because the country has progressed, people are better off,\" said Nicol\u00e1s Robledo, 24, who works at car wash. \"Who could buy themselves a car before?\"\n\nUruguay's presidential frontrunner Daniel Martinez, left, and his running-mate Graciela Villar, of the ruling party Broad Front, attend their closing campaign rally in Montevideo, Uruguay, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019.

Vice President Ra\u00fal Sendic had to resign in 2017 over corruption allegations, the government has failed to address a dismal high school graduation rate, and a record 414 homicides last year have made public safety an urgent issue.\n\n\"I think Mart\u00ednez is a good person, but I'm not voting for him because I don't want the Broad Front to win and open the door for some of the shameless people in this government to show up,\" said Susana L\u00f3pez, a 60-year-old shop worker.\n\nMart\u00ednez, a 62-year-old engineer who has held posts in government and the private sector, has urged voters to stick to the process of \"change and social justice\" that his party promotes.\n\nLacalle Pou, 47, who was the runner up in the 2014 election, has a political pedigree, with a father who was president and a mother who was a senator. He has been plugging his own policies and those of a range of other parties from the center-left to the right that he hopes will help him form a government.\n\nAlthough the Broad Front leads in the polls, political scientist Adolfo Garc\u00e9 said a second round win could be difficult. A number of other parties have already declared their intention to support the National Party or the candidate with the strongest chance of beating the incumbent in a second round.\n\nUruguayans will also elect 99 deputies and 30 senators and they will be voting on a series of referendums on tough on crime measures. They include introducing possible life imprisonment for the most serious crimes, creating a new unit of the military to help with public safety, and scrapping early release of prisoners convicted of the worst offences.\n\nPresidential frontrunner Daniel Martinez, of the ruling party Broad Front, speaks to supporters during his closing campaign rally in Montevideo, Uruguay, Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2019.
