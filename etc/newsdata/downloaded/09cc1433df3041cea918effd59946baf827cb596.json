REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\n\nBREZE, Bosnia (Reuters) - Zorica Rebernik has spent her life in red and plans to stay that way \u2014 even after she dies.\n\nAfter four decades dressing in the colour from head to toe, the 67-year-old Bosnian has had tombstones made for herself and husband Zoran \u2014 whom she married wearing a red gown \u2014 from a special red granite imported from India.\n\nThe retired schoolteacher lives in a red house, where she and Zoran eat from red plates, drink from red glasses and sleep in red bedding. Even her hair is dyed red.\n\n\u201cWhen I turned 18 or 19 there came a sudden, strong urge to wear red,\u201d Rebernik told Reuters. \u201cThere must not be a single dot of any other colour on my home decorations or clothes.\u201d\n\nWearing shades like scarlet and vermillion gives her \u201cthe feeling of strength and power\u201d.\n\nRebernik\u2019s obsession with the colour has made her a local celebrity in her hometown of Breze, close to Tuzla in northern Bosnia.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows me. As soon as people see me, they offer me different red things,\u201d she said, adding that she would reject any gift that was not red, no matter how precious.\n\nShe even goes to funerals dressed in red, eschewing traditional black.\n\nThe only problem is that her husband does not notice when Zorica wears something new. \u201cI can\u2019t tell the difference. Everything is the same,\u201d he said.", "description": "Zorica Rebernik has spent her life in red and plans to stay that way -- even after she dies.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441890222&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G18J", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
