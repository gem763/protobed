Air is not fit to breathe. Pollution levels are off the charts; at some places the safe limit of AQI has been crossed by 16-20 times. However, there are some people who still seem to be justifying the bursting of crackers, and the pollution and littering that followed.\n\nThese people do not seem to care for those suffering from respiratory issues like asthma or even their own health, in general. The excess pollution during Diwali makes life difficult for everyone; we all end up inhaling smoke and toxins we really should not be. Strays and pets are massively frightened and scared of the noise that is produced.\n\nThe East Delhi Municipal Corporation had to 'sprinkle water on roads in Anand Vihar area, to settle the dust as a pollution control measure', according to ANI.\n\nDelhi: East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC)\n\nsprinkles water on roads in Anand Vihar area, to settle the dust as a pollution control measure.

Son had massive breathing issues. Had to run around at 1am for his nebuliser medicine. Went to 24-hr chemists at Artemis, Medanta, Cloud 9, finally found it at Paras. We are all doomed for the next two months now. https://t.co/XO4EM7AH4V \u2014 Satbir Singh (@thesatbir) October 28, 2019\n\nInstagram\n\nOne of my stray dogs has forced her way in my house and is hiding under the table absolutely petrified because of the crackers \u2014 her whole body shaking, her teeth chattering. Just want to say fuck you all to the depths of hell if you burst crackers you jerks. \u2014 Mahima Kukreja \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf08\u270a\ud83c\udffd (@AGirlOfHerWords) October 26, 2019\n\nI FUCKING HATE YOU ALL FOR DOING THIS TO ANIMALS YOU HEARTLESS SWINE pic.twitter.com/I5w21IPvli \u2014 Mahima Kukreja \ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf08\u270a\ud83c\udffd (@AGirlOfHerWords) October 26, 2019\n\nMy dog was in a terrible state last night! So many really LOUD fireworks for Diwali and went on for hours! Couldn\u2019t get her to go in the garden for a wee! She\u2019s nearly 11 and breaks my heart to see her so scared. \u2014 Catherine Kelly (@cathykelly62) October 28, 2019\n\nHappy Diwali to all my fellow Indians. Let\u2019s hope this Diwali brings more light and shine to us. Let\u2019s light up Diwali with diyas and keep these furry ones in mind before bursting any crackers. It was horrible to see them this scared. pic.twitter.com/2TGmx8sYoa \u2014 Rohit Sharma (@ImRo45) October 27, 2019\n\nMy neighborhood dog has come inside the house and he is clearly scared of the firecracker booms outside.\n\nEnjoy your #Diwali #KaliPujo, but don't make it a scary one for our furry friends \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nA bright #Diwali is better than a #LoudDiwali pic.twitter.com/JtWHR9E7SQ \u2014 Raymond Rozario (@BasicallyRay) October 27, 2019\n\nI am only worried about the post diwali smoke that fills up the early morning skies with tremendous toxicity and its tough to do breathing exercises(especially if you are asthmatic) or any workout. I hope all fitness icons take this issue very seriously. \u2014 Sengri B \ud83e\udd8b (@barman_rini) October 27, 2019\n\n\n\nLet us care for people around us who suffer from problems and for creatures who cannot voice their emotions. Crackers are not only bad for the environment, they're almost unnecessary, if you think about it. Not bursting crackers worth thousands of rupees won't take anything away from the joy or meaning of this festival. It might, however, spare us the toxins we will be breathing in for the next couple of weeks.\n\nFB Image Credits: Reuters", "description": "Internet is filled with the news of the aftermath of the Diwali celebrations of last night- Delhi NCR are choking on air.
