This is something that we felt was the right decision for the both of us.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDanny continued: \u2018I would like to say thank you to everyone who has been understanding of the situation, and who has personally supported us both through this difficult time.\n\n\u2018My time spent with Jourdan was honestly one of my most happiest, and I would like to wish her the best moving forward.\u2019\n\nHowever, Jourdan\u2019s statement on the split was a lot less positive.\n\nThe influencer \u2013 also accompanying a moody picture of herself \u2013 wrote: \u2018I have to respect me first.\n\n\u2018I genuinely had such a great time in my relationship and I don\u2019t regret the decisions I\u2019ve made as far as choosing to give someone a chance however, I have boundaries. In a relationship there are things I won\u2019t tolerate. Lack of respect, disloyalty & dishonesty are amongst those things.\n\n\u2018I know people will come with the \u201cI told you so\u201d, \u201cyou should\u2019ve listened\u201d (maybe it\u2019s true) & more than likely snigger/laugh at my situation. The reality is my mum raised me to be a strong woman and always give the benefit of the doubt and let people prove themselves to you. Which is what I did.\n\nI went into this with a genuine heart & real intention to make it work. The love was as real as the hurt is now. But\u2026. I will continue to grow and love myself first. If it doesn\u2019t feel right, it\u2019s not right.\u2019\n\nJourdan ended things (Picture: Splash News)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis shock split comes just weeks after the couple confirmed they had moved in together.\n\nWhile it was assumed that Jourdan had moved into her own house alone, Danny, 21, was seen holding the keys to the same gaff and wrote on Instagram: \u2018Feeling grateful to be able to make this possible. Hard work pays off\ud83e\udd42Excited for the next chapter.\u2019\n\nThe pair were only a couple for a few days in the villa, following Danny\u2019s romances with Yewande Biala and Arabella Chi, but just a week after they were dumped from the island, the islanders had made it official.\n\nNow just two couples from the class of 2019 remain \u2013 Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, and Curtis Pritchard and Maura Higgins. Let\u2019s hope the winter edition has better luck.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
