But the 24-year-old maintained his composure and set about his gameplan.\n\nSpivak exploited Tuivasa\u2019s lack of takedown defense as he took the Australian to the canvas SEVEN times over the course of the contest.\n\nAnd after the seventh successful takedown, Spivak quickly gained mount, where he connected with a plethora of powerful punches before switching from strikes to submissions and locking up an arm-triangle choke.\n\nTuivasa refused to tap as he attempted to ride out the hold, but the Ukrainian\u2019s squeeze was too powerful as Spivak choked Tuivasa unconscious to score his first UFC win in dramatic fashion and take his promising career record to 10-1.\n\nSilencing the Melbourne faithful!\n\n\n\nSerghei Spivak picking up an impressive submission in the second at #UFC243! \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddfa pic.twitter.com/NXVZ8oUZkZ \u2014 UFC Europe (@UFCEurope) October 6, 2019", "description": "Largely unheralded Ukrainian heavyweight Sergei Spivak stunned the Melbourne crowd at UFC 243 as he put crowd favorite Tai \u2018Bam Bam\u2019 Tuivasa to sleep with an arm-triangle choke in Melbourne.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d997f8185f5404068605d19.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
