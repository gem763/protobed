The \u201cAll In\u201d campaign, launched in July, has the support of baseball\u2019s Giants and the NFL\u2019s 49ers, as well as Airbnb, Google, Postmates and dozens of nonprofits and other businesses.\n\nPhilanthropist Daniel Lurie, founder of the anti-poverty nonprofit behind \u201cAll In,\u201d says he wants to inspire people in a city known for its liberal politics to tackle a problem mired in negativity, despair and partisan fighting.\n\n\u201cSome people are fed up, some people are exasperated, some people are just giving up and we need to bring all of those people and say, \u2018Listen, here are solutions that you can get behind,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to sacrifice a little bit.\u201d\n\nA one-night count earlier this year found the number of homeless people increased 17% over two years to more than 8,000 people, according to The Associated Press.\n\nMeanwhile, the city is booming with well-paying tech and finance jobs that critics say are squeezing out the working and middle classes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "San Francisco\u2019s Public Works Department removed numerous boulders along city streets just after a band of residents placed them there to deter open-drug dealing and to keep people from camping out.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/homeless-boulder-KTVU.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
