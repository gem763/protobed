The same themes are discussed, again and again, through shifting formats and avatars. A short story about a reality TV contestant may foreshadow a theoretical essay on Kim Kardashian. Stagg picks apart modern dating by examining her own experiences and giving us picturesque vignettes about young people living with bedbugs. Meanwhile, the many narrators in these pieces make it hard to tell who exactly is speaking. Certain details align fleetingly with the author\u2019s biography, while other sections are related through third-person characters with distinctly different lives.\n\nSleeveless opens at a restaurant in Manhattan, where the narrator is listening to people at the next table over trade declarations on the city\u2019s faded charms. She overhears that \u201cparties\u201d and \u201cgetting fucked up\u201d are still viable activities, though the latter may soon be \u201cgoing out of style.\u201d She notices the group\u2019s names, occupations, and the almost nostalgic tableau they form: four high-powered friends gabbing over \u201ctequila cocktails,\u201d an early-aughts ideal of urban sociality with witty banter as its garnish. The narrator, meanwhile, strikes a more contemporary pose, alone with her laptop open, in good freelancer form. \u201cYou can\u2019t move here and expect to be able to live the way the locals do,\u201d she remarks\u2014who today can afford \u201cdeep-rooted friendships,\u201d anyway?\n\nThe residents in this neighborhood are universally \u201cawful to talk to and great to eavesdrop on.\u201d One of them brags about having recently taken the subway.\n\nEavesdropping might be the only enduring tradition the city has left, and Stagg weaponizes this outsider-insider sensibility wherever she goes, feeding all the best lines to her reader. \u201cWomen are so trendy right now,\u201d claims someone at a magazine launch; we witness another individual \u201cidentify\u201d as \u201chairless.\u201d Stagg\u2019s powers of observation benefit from her position on the margins, and when she prowls the Upper East Side she does so with an eye specially attuned to the mustiness of old glamour. She lists the wedge salads, the big diamonds, the dogs that look like they trotted out of a \u201c1950s painting.\u201d The residents in this neighborhood are universally \u201cawful to talk to and great to eavesdrop on.\u201d One of them brags about having recently taken the subway. New York is the mirror plane of social media, where voyeurs are free to relate every observation, and \u201cthe best thing to be \u2026 is watched and heard.\u201d\n\nEven as Sleeveless perfectly inhabits the disorienting feel of our digital times, Stagg also seems self-consciously frustrated with the book\u2019s limits. While the internet induces confusion and boredom, it also possesses its own corners of rapture, spaces of belonging and discovery where emotions pitch at a joyous, almost hysterical key. How to portray this without lapsing into clich\u00e9? Stagg herself notes that when she thinks of the internet, she feels \u201ccrushed \u2026 maybe like I have an infatuation with everyone at once.\u201d She adds later: \u201cIt is hard to write about how high it makes me feel.\u201d\n\nIf the traditional bildungsroman metes out knowledge in slow and painful bursts, Stagg seems to possess, at the outset, a perfect understanding of our turbo-connected era. Sleeveless resonates with recent books by Sally Rooney, Halle Butler, and Ottessa Moshfegh, in which young women come of age but never quite feel a loss of innocence, often because they started out already familiar with the world\u2019s limits and hypocrisies.", "description": "A new collection of essays perfectly evokes the excitement and the anguish of young creative people in New York.", "authors": ["Zo\u00eb Hu"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d06e1fc69c95942dcfa1faf45faf9b9584326703.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
