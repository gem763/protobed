Can It Last Into Fall?", "language": "en", "text": "The canned hard seltzer White Claw made a splash on social media as the pumpkin spice latte of the summer. It started with a video created by comedian Trevor Wallace. In the clip, titled \u201c*drinks White Claw once*,\u201d the YouTuber lounges by a pool, calls the sparkling beverage LaCroix \u201cjust a virgin White Claw\u201d and declares, \u201cAin\u2019t no laws when you\u2019re drinking Claws.\u201d That phrase has already made its way onto unofficial, Etsy-created merchandise like T-shirts and drink koozies. Even the frequently invoked tagline \u201cHot Girl Summer,\u201d popularized by rapper Megan Thee Stallion, has been replaced by some with the term \u201cWhite Claw Summer,\u201d inspiring writer Harry Lyles Jr. to tweet: \u201ca stranger yelled \u201cwhite claw summer!\u201d to me across the pool. as much as i wanted to be all \u201ci don\u2019t know you\u201d i had to raise my lime claw and agree that it is indeed, white claw summer\u201d. Twitter says there have been 700,000 tweets about White Claw this year, 85% of which were posted between June 1 and September 3.\n\nSocial media and memes are just two factors that have fueled the rise of hard seltzers, with Mark Anthony Group\u2019s White Claw taking a firm lead in the category. As of July, the brand represented more than half of hard seltzer sales, followed by Boston Beer Company\u2019s Truly with 29%. And as millennial drinkers enter their 30s, White Claw checks off the qualities they most value in a beverage: convenience in a 12 oz. can, carbonation, not savoring heavily of alcohol, light in calories and coming in basic fruit flavors, especially compared to increasingly complex craft beers and IPAs. Heading into summer, White Claw sales tripled within a 12-week span, according to analysis of IRI data by Beer Marketer\u2019s Insights.\n\nWas White Claw\u2019s dominance just a fleeting, meme-happy moment that managed to beat booze\u2019s typical end-of-summer slump? After sales peak for Memorial Day and Fourth of July, the beer industry enters its own \u201cdog days of summer,\u201d says Lester Jones, chief economist at the National Beer Wholesalers Association. \u201cBut for hard seltzers, it stayed elevated and it kept on growing,\u201d Jones says.\n\nThe drink\u2019s resilience will be tested over the next couple of months, when wines and spirits typically reach their sales peaks\u2014but when hard seltzer is predicted to fall. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting for both the fall and the winter, just how many more occasions seltzer can take from other products,\u201d Jones says. \u201cSeltzer\u2019s real impact on the industry will be evident in the fourth quarter of this year if we see some sustained level of sales in the retailers for those months.\u201d\n\nAccording to White Claw\u2019s senior vice president of marketing Sanjiv Gajiwala, the drink\u2019s sales are up slightly since the memes first took off in June. White Claw says the flood of user-created social content will be recognized in upcoming communications from the brand. (The brand says it spent $12 million on advertising between April and September of this year.)\n\nGajiwala says the next step is to turn the product into a year-long staple. \u201cWe feel like hard seltzers play a role in every occasion where consumers are celebrating. There are a lot of occasions like that through the fall and into the winter, whether it\u2019s football tailgating or Halloween or holiday parties,\u201d says Gajiwala. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna try to activate around those times of years and those periods.\u201d Gajiwala hopes that the beverage will enter more households than the 5.6% of American ones that have purchased it so far.\n\nFor Jessica Smetana, 25, White Claw has been and will continue to be a year-round beverage. She was first introduced to the hard seltzer back in 2016 during a tailgate at the University of Notre Dame. Smetana has a gluten allergy that prevents her from drinking beer and White Claw was the ideal drink for the event. \u201cWhen you\u2019re tailgating, you can\u2019t just drink a shot of vodka. You want something to sip on,\u201d she says. She plans on drinking White Claw and other spiked seltzers at sporting events this fall. \u201cI can see it definitely staying popular into the fall. I don\u2019t know January through May if people will want to drink them...I will, because it\u2019s a great option for me as a non-beer drinker.\u201d\n\nSmetana also notices that the White Claw memes have continued into the fall. Making the Twitter and Instagram rounds is a mock White Claw advertisement for a fictional, autumn-focused pumpkin spice flavor. The image was originally posted on country music entertainment site Whiskey Riff by its White Claw\u2013drinking co-founder, Wes Langeler. \u201cWe like to do a lot of stuff where we just leave it up to interpretation,\u201d Langeler says about the ad. \u201cThere\u2019s tons of people who are like, \u2018This is 100 percent fake,\u2019 and then tons of other people are like, \u2018Where can we get this?\u2019\u201d (According to White Claw, a pumpkin spice flavor of White Claw has not been developed). In anticipation of drinking White Claw this winter, Smetana recently tweeted that during the holiday season, White Claws will be called \u201cSanta Claws.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get so many suggestions from consumers for such off-the-wall flavors,\u201d says Gajiwala, citing a Twitter recommendation for ham-flavored White Claw. Still, the brand plans to stick with their classic varieties like black cherry, mango and lime. \u201cFor us, we want to build a brand with flavors that are widely accepted. Ones that are simple and natural.\u201d", "description": "Despite social media gags, there\u2019s no pumpkin spice White Claw in the offing\u2014and no \u201choliday ham,\u201d either. So how will the drink of summer fit into colder months? Meme-makers, drinkers and analysts weigh in", "authors": ["Natalia Barr"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107126/social", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
