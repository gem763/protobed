It starts off like a rehash of the NYT\u2019s hit job on Brett Kavanaugh, but as correspondent Jan Crawford noted on Twitter, it takes a sharply critical turn at the end. Not only does Crawford note that every one of Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s cited witnesses say the alleged high-school party with Kavanaugh never happened, Crawford uses the cutting-room floor clippings from the NYT\u2019s story to focus on Leland Keyser\u2019s claim of witness tampering.\n\nOuch. Very much ouch:\n\nWe report tonight the real bombshell: Christine Ford\u2019s close HS friend (who Ford says was at the party when Kavanaugh allegedly assaulted her) said Ford\u2019s story is not believable and told the FBI Ford\u2019s allies pressured her, threatened her with a smear campaign to say otherwise https://t.co/GQhBTXHcze \u2014 Jan Crawford (@JanCBS) September 17, 2019\n\nThe details of Keyser\u2019s experience with those who pressured her to change her story started coming out last October, but only now \u2014 buried at the back of the new book from two NYT reporters \u2014 do we have an outright dismissal of Blasey Ford\u2019s claims from Keyser. Somehow the NYT\u2019s editors thought rehashing old and utterly uncorroborated campus gossip from the Golden Girls era was bigger news than witness tampering by Blasey Ford\u2019s allies. If you missed yesterday\u2019s adventures in the collapse of credibility at the New York Times regarding Keyser, catch up here.\n\nCrawford, one of CBS News\u2019 more independent voices, sums up the situation well at the end of this report:\n\nNow, all four people that Ford identified as being at that high school party in the summer of 1982 have all said that no such party occurred. And today, both the Republican chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Democratic chair of the House Judiciary Committee said they would not support impeaching Kavanaugh.\n\nCase closed, right? Actually, maybe. Politico reported last night that senior Democrats have heard enough about Kavanaugh and want to end talk of impeachment, although they\u2019re not exactly being gracious about it:\n\nSenior Democrats are moving quickly to snuff out calls to impeach Brett Kavanaugh, arguing those tactics are unrealistic and politically harmful. \u2026 \u201cGet real,\u201d as Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) put it Monday afternoon. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get beyond this \u2018impeachment is the answer to every problem.\u2019 It\u2019s not realistic,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cIf that\u2019s how we are identified in Congress, as the impeachment Congress, we run the risk that people will feel we\u2019re ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families.\u201d\n\nPolitico also reports that other Democrats are \u201clivid\u201d that the FBI didn\u2019t check out the claim from a third party that Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a different party. Er, what exactly were they supposed to investigate? The informant wasn\u2019t at the party, and the supposed victim doesn\u2019t recall such an incident happening. The FBI has better things to do than to chase down 35-year-old campus rumors about rowdy parties with no complaining witnesses. Talk about not realistic.\n\nNo one expects the Democrats to admit that they participated in a witch hunt and character assassination, although such an admission would certainly be nice. But maybe, just maybe, they can shut the hell up about it and let us pretend they have some remorse over the Kavanaugh episode. Especially now that CBS\u2019 Jan Crawford has boiled it down to its essence.", "description": "Politico: Senior Democrats pulling the plug on impeachment.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cbs-keyser.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
