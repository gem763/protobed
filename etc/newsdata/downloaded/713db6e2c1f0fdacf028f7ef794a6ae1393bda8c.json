Or are they all a bit 1990s, and a leftover from a world prior to the disruption wrought by the internet?\n\nThe MBA originated in the fast-growing US economy of the early 20th century, as companies sought scientific ways to manage bureaucratic conglomerates. A degree with a bit of accounting, law, ethics, managerial economics, marketing, operations and much else besides was seen a great way to train young thrusters wanting to have a shot at running companies.\n\nYet it is essential that these degrees keep up with today\u2019s disrupted world, where the internet has killed barriers to entry and where \"move fast, break things\" types in T-shirts can very quickly destroy old business models. Those on the Boss list who have done the degree sing its praises for giving them a skill edge in the business world. Now it\u2019s up to MBA providers to retain that edge.", "description": "An idea born in the 20th century must work in the 'move fast and break things' era.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/2117c086426d950aa0a37c7464a6b18d2fc04d1b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
