Yet am I an active campaigner? Do I do enough? No\u2026\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not saying, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist, guys.\u201d But I could do more. I eat meat. Not loads, but I like a roast. And I drive a car. I don\u2019t not get on planes\u2026.\n\n\u2018This is what I mean about bigger thinking, for all of us. We just need more ingenuity. But the plane thing is tough. I won\u2019t not fly, because I\u2019ve got to get where I\u2019m going.\u2019\n\nMatt Smith and Lily James have been dating since 2014 (Photo by David M.

I\u2019ll go, \u201cOh man, polar bears. F**king polar bears!\u201d I\u2019ll wig out about them not having ice to get back on.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t have children yet, but having them would make me think about it a lot more.\u2019\n\nThe former Doctor Who actor \u2013 who is currently in a relationship with actress Lily James \u2013 admitted his friends and family are central to his existence and, although he likes to \u2018take risks\u2019 and have fun, he ultimately thinks the purpose of life is to \u2018procreate\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
