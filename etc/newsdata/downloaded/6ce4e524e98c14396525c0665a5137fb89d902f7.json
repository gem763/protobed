The offices IAB targeted included the headquarters of the Special Victims Division, the Manhattan Special Victims Squad, and the DNA cold case squad in the Bronx, where the investigation of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was centered.\n\n\u201cThis investigation has nothing to do with the Weinstein case,\u201d one senior police official told The Daily Beast.\n\nLast year, the Special Victims Division\u2014the model for the \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d television franchise\u2014was the subject of a scathing watchdog report by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation, which found that the division was woefully understaffed and that some detectives were not properly trained.\n\nThe NYPD launched an overhaul, transferring more detectives to the division, requiring that all felony sex crimes cases go to the division, and renovating facilities. Deputy Chief Judith Harrison, a 21-year veteran, was tapped to run the division, and said she was introducing a \u201cvictim-centered\u201d approach.\n\nBut the IAB probe would be another black eye for the division, which has come under fire for its handling of the Weinstein investigation.\n\nLast year, prosecutors dropped one of the charges against the producer after revealing that one of the lead investigator, Detective Nicholas DiGaudio, did not flag contradictions in an accuser\u2019s account.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office claimed that DiGaudio told her to keep quiet about the inconsistency, which he denied. A different accuser told prosecutors that DiGaudio told her to delete anything on her phone she didn\u2019t want the DA to see before she turned it over\u2014giving Weinstein\u2019s lawyers ammunition to cry police misconduct. DiGaudio is no longer on the case.", "description": "A top team in the Internal Affairs Bureau appears to be investigating someone in the vaunted sex-crimes division, a source said.", "authors": ["Michael Daly", "Pervaiz Shallwani", "Special Correspondent", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569342815/190924-connor-nypdsvu-tease_vgo26n", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
