Michael \"shroud\" Grzesiek is joining him.\n\n\"Apex Legends\" livestreamer Michael \"shroud\" Grzesiek has moved from Amazon's video game viewing service Twitch to Microsoft's competitor, Mixer, where he is featuring new release \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare,\" at least initially.\n\nOriginally a professional-level \"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\" player, the Canadian channel host shifted primary focus from \"CS:GO\" to smash hit \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" and then another popular Battle Royale genre choice \"Apex Legends.\"\n\nGrzesiek left for Mixer at a time when he had amassed 7 million followers on Twitch. Financial terms were not disclosed, though Blevins is thought to have agreed to a USD $50m deal.\n\nThat audience made him the service's third most-followed streamer, behind \"Fortnite\" player Turner \"Tfue\" Tenney (7.1m followers) and Ninja (\"Fortnite,\" 14m), who has not streamed on Twitch since July 29.\n\nNinja now has 2.4 million followers on Mixer, where he is currently the service's most-followed channel host; Shroud accumulated 1.7m followers in the day since his own move.\n\nMixer is incentivizing sign-ups by offering free member subscriptions to shroud's channel until November 22.\n\nAs for Microsoft, it is not only raising Mixer's profile but also preparing for a new generation of console and video game technology that accommodates both video streaming and the streaming of games themselves.\n\nA new Xbox console, codenamed Project Scarlett, is to launch opposite the PlayStation 5 late 2020. Scarlett will support Microsoft's game streaming platform Project xCloud, which is currently in testing.\n\nMeanwhile, Xbox Game Pass has been gaining traction as a subscription service that provides access to several hundred video games on demand, including day and date releases of popular first-party titles such as \"Sea of Thieves,\" \"Forza Horizon 4,\" \"Gears 5,\" \"The Outer Worlds\" and 2020's \"Halo Infinite.\"", "description": "Microsoft's video game livestreaming service Mixer recruited high-profile player and entertainer Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins in July.
