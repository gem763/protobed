I want to make sure that there\u2019s nothing that I do that jeopardizes the whistleblower in any way,\u201d Schiff told CNN when asked if the whistleblower has contacted him.\n\nThe Post called this answer a \u201cclassic dodge\u201d and noted that the CNN host didn\u2019t bother with a follow-up question \u2013 which helped Schiff avoid giving a potentially damaging answer.\n\n\u201cHe managed not to mislead; he just simply did not answer the question,\u201d Kessler wrote of Schiff.\n\nMIKA BRZEZINSKI PUBLICLY SUPPORTED NEWS VET BROKAW AMID MISCONDUCT CLAIMS, PRIVATELY APOLOGIZED TO ACCUSE\n\n\u201cSchiff earns Four Pinocchios.\u201d \u2014 Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler\n\nThe very next day, Schiff appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d where he seemingly graduated from dodging to lying, the Post says.\n\n\u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower,\u201d Schiff said on MSNBC.\n\nKessler noted that this is \u201cflat-out false\u201d given information that has since become available.\n\n\u201cUnlike the quick two-step dance he performed with Anderson Cooper, Schiff simply says the committee had not spoken to the whistleblower. Now we know that\u2019s not true,\u201d the Post\u2019s fact-checker wrote.\n\nA committee spokesman attempted to defend Schiff in a statement to the Post: \u201cHe intended to answer the question of whether the Committee had heard testimony from the whistleblower, which they had not\u2026 the whistleblower was then awaiting instructions from the Acting DNI as to how the whistleblower could contact the Committee. Nonetheless, he acknowledges that his statement should have been more carefully phrased to make that distinction clear.\u201d\n\nPELOSI DEFENDS SCHIFF AFTER BEING PRESSED ABOUT HIS 'PARODY' OF TRUMP'S UKRAINE CALL\n\nOn Sept. 19, Schiff was at it again, according to the Post, when speaking with reporters at the Capitol.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of the actions, and I want to thank the inspector general, in the absence of his actions in coming to our committee, we might not have even known there was a whistleblower complaint alleging an urgent concern,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nThe Post\u2019s fact-checker called this \u201cmisleading\u201d comment \u201cmore dissembling\u201d and noted that \u201chis committee knew that something explosive was going to be filed with the IG.\u201d\n\nKessler wrote there \u201care right ways and wrong ways to answer reporters\u2019 questions if a politician wants to maintain his or her credibility\u201d and there is \u201cnothing wrong with dodging a question, as long as you don\u2019t try to mislead.\u201d\n\nBut Schiff \u201cclearly made a statement that was false\u201d on MSNBC and \u201ccompounded his falsehood\u201d when speaking with reporters at the Capitol, Kessler wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cThe explanation that Schiff was not sure it was the same whistleblower especially strains credulity,\u201d Kessler wrote. \u201cSchiff earns Four Pinocchios.\u201d\n\nThe Post\u2019s Fact Checker team considered Four Pinocchios to be \u201cwhoppers\u201d and most egregious offense outside of the rare \u201cBottomless Pinocchio.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have also decried how Schiff, during a hearing last week, read a \"parody\" version of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine's president.\n\nFox News\u2019 Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "The Washington Post awarded \u201cFour Pinocchios\u201d to House Intelligence Committee Chairman\u00a0Adam Schiff on Friday, claiming he hadn't told the truth\u00a0about his knowledge of the whistleblower.", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Washington Post Fact-Checker Glenn Kessler", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.
