But they have yet to receive any answers from the Pentagon.\n\nThe inquiry is part of a broader, previously unreported probe into U.S. military expenditures at and around the Trump property in Scotland. According to a letter the panel sent to the Pentagon in June, the military has spent $11 million on fuel at the Prestwick Airport \u2014 the closest airport to Trump Turnberry \u2014 since October 2017, fuel that would be cheaper if purchased at a U.S. military base. The letter also cites a Guardian report that the airport provided cut-rate rooms and free rounds of golf at Turnberry for U.S. military members.\n\nTaken together, the incidents raise the possibility that the military has helped keep Trump\u2019s Turnberry resort afloat \u2014 the property lost $4.5 million in 2017, but revenue went up $3 million in 2018.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
