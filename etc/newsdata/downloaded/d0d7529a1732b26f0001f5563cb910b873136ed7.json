The sisters also claim that they have been contacted by three more people linked to the women through DNA sites like Ancestry.com and 23andMe.com.\n\n\"I don\u2019t deny it. I don\u2019t admit it,\u201d Jones, now 80, told KUSA. When a reporter asked Jones if he fathered the children, the doctor called the question \"impertinent\" and added, \"I'm not going to answer it.\"\n\n\u201cI feel [Jones] needs to own up to what he did,\u201d Emmons-Boring told the station at her home in San Antonio. \u201cI would like to ask him, \u2018Why? Why did you do this?\u2019\u201d\n\nKANSAS MAN TAKES JOY RIDE THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD ON CONSTRUCTION ELEVATOR, POLICE SAY\n\nEmmons-Boring, 39, says she realized that the father she\u2019d grown up with was not her biological father after receiving a message from a stranger in her Ancestry.com inbox on New Year's Eve of last year.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019re close matches, so I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re half-siblings,\u201d wrote the stranger. \u201cMy father was a sperm donor in Grand Junction, Colorado [Emmons-Boring's hometown]. I\u2019ve found three more half-sisters and a half-brother who\u2019s [sic] parents also used the donor at the same clinic.\u201d\n\nAt first, Emmons-Boring thought the message was part of a scam and began researching the reliability of Ancestry\u2019s DNA testing. What she found online convinced her the message was not a hoax, and after informing her younger sister, Tahnee Scott, the pair decided to talk to their mother, Cheryl Emmons.\n\n\u201cAt first [our mom] said, \u2018No,\u2019 and then my dad, who is very quiet and reserved, he says \u2014 he kind of interrupted her \u2014 he said, \u2018Yes, we used a sperm donor to conceive you and Tahnee,\u2019\u201d Emmons-Boring said. \u201cOur world got turned upside down more or less,\u201d Scott added.\n\nThe station reported that Cheryl Emmons consulted Dr. Jones to help her conceive out of fear that she and her husband would be unable to do so due to his recent bout with testicular cancer.\n\nJones, who had been practicing since 1972, assured Emmons he would use an anonymous sperm donor.\n\n\"[Jones] said there were medical students, you know, at St. Mary\u2019s [Medical Center], and so, anyway, one thing led to another and we said, \u2018OK,\u2019\u201d Emmons told KUSA. At the time, freezing sperm was not common practice, so doctors relied on \u201cfresh samples\u201d provided 30 minutes or so before the mother\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cInstead of using \u2018fresh\u2019 sperm from an anonymous donor to inseminate Mrs. Emmons during these procedures, Dr. Jones used his own \u2018fresh\u2019 sperm to artificially inseminate Plaintiff Mrs. Emmons,\u201d the suit alleged.\n\nJones procured successful insemination and helped deliver baby Maia in 1980. Five years later, Jones assisted again with the artificial insemination of Emmons and returned to helped deliver baby Tahnee.\n\n\u201cWe have pictures. Maia has them now,\u201d recalled Emmons. \u201c[Jones] took some pictures of all of us, you know, in the delivery room.\u201d\n\nEmmons recalled that when she visited Jones\u2019 office in Grand Junction, \u201cHe never included my husband in anything, and I thought that was odd.\u201d However, Emmons added that \u201cI really thought he was doing a good thing for me and my sweet husband.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Jones told the couple to go home on the night of the insemination and \"make love so that they would not know if the conceived child was from the anonymous donor...\u201d according to the lawsuit. Emmons said she had thought it was possible, though unlikely, that her husband was the biological father of her daughters.\n\nIn the years that followed, Jones would occasionally send letters to the family. After the Emmons family moved to California, Emmons said they unexpectedly ran into Jones at a mall and he made a point of saying hello to Maia.\n\nUTAH MAN, 24, ALLEGEDLY KILLS MOM, LIVE STREAMS SCENE ON FACEBOOK: POLICE\n\nEmmons-Boring told KUSA she set out to find who her biological father was after her sister took a DNA test and confirmed that they had been conceived from the same sperm donor. She was it took her three weeks to figure it out.\n\nHer attorney requested a genealogy report, which used a public family tree posted by Dr. Jones\u2019 brother. The tree linked a common ancestor, a second cousin, between Emmons-Boring and Jones. From this, genealogist Kathleen Hinckley deduced that the siblings might be the biological children of Jones or his brother.\n\nJones\u2019 brother said he couldn\u2019t have supplied the sperm because he moved from Grand Junction in 1972.\n\nWhen KUSA confronted Jones at his Grand Junction home, he told the station: \u201cMy attorney says don\u2019t talk to the press.\u201d He said he would not take a DNA test, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to have any incriminating evidence against me.\u201d He later added that he might consider taking a test if the Emmons family would consider dropping the case.\n\n\u201cNever, ever did [Jones] tell me that he would be the donor,\u201d said Patty Gray, a patient of Jones whose son Ryan appears to be a half-sibling of Emmons-Boring and Scott. \u201cI would have remembered, because I would have left.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is a doctor who is supposed to be a professional, somebody you have trust in,\u201d she added. \u201cHe owes all of us an explanation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we would have stayed in Grand Junction, we could have been marrying our brothers and sisters, which is kind of disgusting to me,\u201d said Shawna Hults, who was donor-conceived and is thought to be another half-sibling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe lawsuit alleges negligence, fraud and other causes of action and seeks damages in civil court.\n\nCurrently, Colorado has no specific law against doctors using their own sperm when inseminating a woman from an \u201canonymous\u201d donor. Texas, where Emmons-Boring currently lives, passed a law earlier this year prohibiting a doctor from inseminating a woman with his own sperm without her consent.\n\nEmmons-Boring told KUSA she plans on working with Colorado legislators to help change the law there, which could open up the possibility of doctors being charged with sexual assault.\n\nClick for more from 9News.com.", "description": "A Texas\u00a0woman\u00a0has accused a longtime\u00a0Colorado fertility doctor of using his own sperm -- rather than sperm from an anonymous donor -- to impregnate her\u00a0mother nearly four decades ago.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/11/pregnancy_dr_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
