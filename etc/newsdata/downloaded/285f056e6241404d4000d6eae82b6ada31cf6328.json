It just doesn\u2019t appear that it\u2019s going to be the distraction that yesterday the market thought it might become.

The S&P 500 technology index .SPLRCT was up 1.2%, while the Philadelphia chip index .SOX gained 1.8%.\n\n\u201cGood economic data is fighting with political noise and good data is winning,\u201d said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.\n\nAdding to the stronger tone, Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected, comments that were in contrast to his harsh rhetoric the day before.\n\nAlso on the trade front, Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced initial details of an emerging trade deal between the two countries, with Trump saying it would open up Japanese markets to $7 billion worth of American products.\n\nShares in Philip Morris (PM.N) surged 5.2% after the tobacco company called off merger talks with Altria Group Inc (MO.N) and said it would instead focus on the U.S. launch of its tobacco-heating product, iQOS.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 18, 2019.
