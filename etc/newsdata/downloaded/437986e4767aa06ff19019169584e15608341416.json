Antonio Brown doesn't have NFL future until allegations are resolved", "language": "en", "text": "Just an hour after his release on Friday by the New England Patriots, Antonio Brown tweeted: \u201cthe marathon continues.\u201d\n\nHopefully Brown wasn\u2019t referring to his football career because if he was, the proper response to that is simple \u2014 you sure?\n\nBrown, one of the NFL\u2019s most gifted wideouts in the past decade, has been a tornado of drama since last year, more so in the past two months. He forced his way out of Oakland with an array of defiant behavior, and saw his short-lived Patriots career end following the fallout from sexual assault and sexual misconduct allegations. He is facing a pending civil lawsuit in federal court on the former.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAt this point, there\u2019s no doubt that playing football immediately should be the absolute last thing on his mind. Yet, here he was again on Twitter on Friday, demonstrating his inability to fully understand his current situation.\n\nIn addition to his \u201cmarathon\u201d message, Brown announced his own dismissal, saying, \u201cThank you for the opportunity @Patriots\u201d and later writing, \u201cJust got fired on a Friday,\u201d a reference to an iconic line in the 1994 classic comedy \u201cFriday.\u201d What\u2019s more, Brown\u2019s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, tweeted that Brown \u201cwants to play the game he loves and he hopes to play for another team soon.\u201d\n\nIt looks like it's going to be awhile before Antonio Brown catches another pass in the NFL. (Getty Images)\n\nThere\u2019s really no humor here. Any rational human being would say: good luck with that, at least for the time being.\n\nDon\u2019t be deluded about how the NFL functions and how the sausage is made. It is the ultimate performance league, one where elite players who can help teams win \u2014 and thus, the coaches and executives employed with their million-dollar salaries \u2014 get longer leashes than others.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut now, we\u2019ve entered territory where Brown is radioactive to every NFL team, at least for the time being. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty in the court of law, but the court of public opinion is another matter. Any team willing to sign a player with sexual misconduct and rape allegations is begging to get crushed by fans, media and impartial observers alike. And rightfully so.\n\nThe league issued a statement Friday night, acknowledging its investigation of Brown and the allegations he\u2019s facing. The statement read:\n\n\u201cWe have as yet made no findings regarding these issues. The investigation is ongoing and will be pursued vigorously and expeditiously. \"As long as Mr. Brown is a free agent, placement on the Commissioner's exempt list is not appropriate. If he is signed by a club, such placement may become appropriate at any time depending on the status of the investigation. Upon the conclusion of the investigation, he may also be subject to discipline if the investigation finds that he has violated the law or league policies.\n\nGood luck trying to prepare for a game with that going on, and if you want to know what that looks like, check out Patriots coach Bill Belichick\u2019s news conference on Friday. Belichick is unflappable for sure, but after a barrage of Brown questions, he had enough and walked away from the podium.\n\nIf Belichick and the Patriots decided Brown wasn\u2019t worth the hassle, why would anyone else? Especially when, after signing him and absorbing that huge public relations nightmare, he could still end up on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list and not be allowed to play \u2013 with a team still footing the salary.\n\nAt this point, Brown has to prioritize getting his off-field affairs in order. The sexual assault lawsuit must resolve itself as it makes its way through the court system, and even then, the NFL will continue to investigate that case and the sexual misconduct allegation against him. The ugly text messages he allegedly sent following the second woman\u2019s public accusation could serve as means for discipline as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Brown\u2019s release means the NFL isn\u2019t under a time crunch, so the investigation can be thorough and teams will likely stay out of it until everything is resolved. If Brown doesn\u2019t understand that now, there\u2019s a good chance he will be confronted with that reality soon.\n\nBeyond that? Maybe \u2014 maybe \u2014 if and when all the aforementioned issues are resolved, he\u2019ll then be afforded the opportunity to work on climbing the other mountain in front of him, which is convincing teams that they won\u2019t have to worry about him duplicating the circus that surrounded him in Oakland.\n\nThat will prove to be a tough chore. No matter how talented a player is, teams will eventually reach their breaking point. The Raiders proved that by cutting him six months after surrendering a pair of draft picks for him, and the Patriots just cut bait with far less lost on their part.\n\nTeams hate distractions, and you have to go back years to find a bigger distraction on an NFL roster than Brown.\n\nBrown\u2019s age (he turns 32 next year) is working against him. Add that to his recent troubles, it\u2019s possible to envision a scenario where Brown never plays in the NFL again, even if he apparently can\u2019t (or simply won\u2019t) see it.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Brown is radioactive to every NFL team.
