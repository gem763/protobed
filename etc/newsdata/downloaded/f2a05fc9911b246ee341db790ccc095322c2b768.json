Netflix NFLX, +0.71% had projected 7 million net subscription additions worldwide, a healthy jump from 6.1 million in the year-ago quarter, and analysts on average projected 6.7 million, according to FactSet.\n\nThe fourth quarter is a different story, however. Netflix projected 7.6 million additions in the fourth quarter, far shy of the 9.6 million Wall Street analysts were expecting, and less than the 8.8 million that Netflix reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. The company also said that it no longer expects subscriber growth to increase for the full year from the 2018 total, in part due to increased competition.\n\n\u201cWhile we had previously expected 2019 paid net adds to be up year-over-year, our current forecast reflects several factors including less precision in our ability to forecast the impact of our Q4 content slate, which consists of several new big IP launches (as opposed to returning seasons), the minor elevated churn in response to some price changes, and new forthcoming competition,\u201d Netflix executives said in a letter to investors.\n\nIn a video earnings call late Wednesday, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings expressed confidence Netflix can compete effectively against less-expensive services coming from Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.40% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.85% , though he acknowledged the considerable content catalog of Disney.\n\nRead more: Netflix has history on its side heading into earnings\n\nThe subscription growth, coupled with strong revenue and earnings, sent shares of Netflix up more than 10% in after-hours trading. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company reported revenue of $5.25 billion, up 31% from a year ago, in line with FactSet estimates. Earnings per share of $1.47 blew past estimates of $1.03 a share, according to FactSet. It did, however, offer Q4 revenue guidance ($5.44 billion) that fell short of FactSet estimates ($5.51 billion).\n\nThe company\u2019s recent story arc has been fraught with fear and uncertainty: A well-documented dip in net subscription additions in the second quarter; the pending loss of seminal content such as \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d to competing streaming services; emerging threats from Apple, Disney, AT&T Inc. T, -0.29% , Comcast Corp.\u2019s CMCSA, -0.15% NBCUniversal and even AMC Theatres. It all added up to a 26% decline in Netflix shares since July 3.\n\n\u201cThe launch of these new services will be noisy,\u201d Netflix executives admitted in their letter. \u201cThere may be some modest headwind to our near-term growth, and we have tried to factor that into our guidance.\u201d\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives warned in a research note Tuesday that Apple in particular has the chance to reduce viewership hours of Netflix. Less expensive subscription services from Apple ($4.99 a month) and Disney ($6.99), their ability to provide potent content through original programming and acquisitions, and massive installed bases \u201ccould enable Apple and Disney to disrupt roughly 15% of Netflix\u2019s target customer base within the next 12 to 18 months and create a much more competitive pricing environment.\u201d\n\nIves added that Apple has committed $6 billion annually to original shows \u2014 significantly more than the $1 billion originally reported \u2014 to \u201ckeep pace in the content arms race.\u201d\n\nWhile Netflix acknowledged in its letter to investors that its rivals have \u201csome great titles (especially catalog titles), none have the variety, diversity and quality of new original programming that we are producing around the world.\u201d Hastings pointed to a \u201cway better\u201d original movie slate that includes \u201cThe Irishman\u201d and \u201cDolemite\u201d during the video call.\n\nThe company said that beginning next quarter it plans to disclose revenue and membership by regions: Asia Pacific (APAC), Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), Latin America (LATAM), and the U.S. and Canada (UCAN). The change in reporting reflects healthy subscription growth overseas and a saturated U.S. market.\n\nMore than the company\u2019s bottom line, subscriptions have been keenly scrutinized. Netflix raised flags in the second quarter when it added 2.7 million new subscribers, well short of its previous guidance for 5 million.\n\nDiminished subscriptions and new streaming services next month from Apple and Disney prompted Raymond James analyst Justin Patterson on Monday to chop his price target on Netflix shares to $415 from $450. Patterson lowered his third- and fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenue estimates by 1%, though he maintained a Strong Buy rating on the strength of improving content library.\n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Bernie McTernan is concerned that competition, in turn, will force Netflix to spend more than $15 billion on content over the long haul to maintain its market dominance, cutting into profits. He slashed his price target to $265 from $330 in an Oct. 8 note.\n\nInfluential media pundit Richard Greenfield, who just launched market research firm LightShed Partners, initiated coverage of Netflix last week with a Buy rating and $375 price target. He acknowledged investors are skittish about another subscriber miss and overly cautious fourth-quarter guidance, but Netflix\u2019s vast content library and status as iconic entertainment hub make it a \u201cunique buying opportunity heading into 2020.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the cracks in the legacy media ecosystem become deeper and more visible with Netflix\u2019s content slate ramping notably into Q4 2019 and 2020, our excitement for Netflix stock over the coming year has grown,\u201d Greenfield wrote.", "description": "Netflix Inc. announced the net addition of 6.77 million paying subscribers in its third-quarter financial results Wednesday afternoon, an about-face from the...", "authors": ["Jon Swartz", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT272_Netfli_ZG_20191014153615.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
