MO, +1.08% \u2014 which owns 35% of e-cigarettes heavyweight Juul Labs Inc. \u2014 lost ground following the news on Wednesday afternoon that the Trump administration was stepping up its efforts to address youth vaping. But the stock then recovered, and it was recently up 0.6%, after trading lower by more than 1%.\n\nThe FDA plans to share more specifics about its plan soon, the Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release. Azar stressed that tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes also could end up being targeted.\n\n\u201cWe want the tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes to remain available for adults who may be using e-cigarettes to be off of combustible tobacco. But if we find that children start surging into tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes, or if we find marketing practices that target children\u2026 we\u2019ll engage in enforcement actions there also,\u201d the HHS chief said.\n\nI just announced with @POTUS and @FDACommissioner that we will be finalizing policies that will clear flavored e-cigarettes from the market. New provisional data show that youth use continues to rise rapidly, and we will not stand idly by. \u2014 Secretary Alex Azar (@SecAzar) September 11, 2019\n\nJust before Azar\u2019s remarks, President Donald Trump voiced support on Wednesday for cracking down on youth vaping. He said \u201cvery, very strong action\u201d may be needed on vaping to protect \u201cinnocent children.\u201d\n\nRelated: Juul\u2019s billionaire co-founder plays defense as House Democrats question company\u2019s moves on youth vaping\n\nAnd see: Makers of flavored e-cigarettes face \u2018a make-or-break year\u2019 in Washington\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s latest move comes a day after the FDA issued a warning letter to Juul for selling its e-cigarettes as \u201cmodified risk tobacco products\u201d without permission from the agency. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recently said they were looking into hundreds of cases of severe respiratory disease possibly associated with e-cigarette use. In addition, Michigan this month took steps to become the first U.S. state to ban flavored e-cigarettes, after San Francisco in June became the first major American city to ban the sale of all e-cigarettes.\n\nAs federal regulators and members of Congress take aim at Juul, the San Francisco-based company \u2014 which is the dominant e-cigarettes player in the U.S. with an estimated market share of about 70% \u2014 has ramped up its lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C. It disclosed lobbying spending of $1.01 million in this year\u2019s second quarter after shelling out $940,000 in the first quarter, meaning it already has topped last year\u2019s outlay of $1.64 million.\n\nThe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said the Trump administration\u2019s planned action on flavored e-cigarettes was \u201ca necessary and long-overdue step,\u201d adding that it \u201cmust be comprehensive, immediate and long-lasting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has taken far too long to stop Juul and other e-cigarettes companies from targeting our nation\u2019s kids with sweet-flavored, nicotine-loaded products that are addicting a new generation and threaten decades of progress in reducing youth tobacco use,\u201d the prominent advocacy group also said in a statement. \u201cWe will work to support a comprehensive prohibition on flavored e-cigarettes, and we urge the administration not to back down in the face of the inevitable pressure from Juul and other manufacturers.\u201d\n\nJuul didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The Trump administration announces a crackdown on electronic cigarettes in an effort to combat the youth vaping epidemic, with Health and Human Services...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GX420_juul_1_ZG_20181031135507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
