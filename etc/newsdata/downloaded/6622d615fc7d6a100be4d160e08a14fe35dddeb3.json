But that still feels like a long time to go (in a galaxy far, far away).\n\nLe Creuset is making the waiting period a little more bearable by releasing a \"Star Wars\" collection, combining iconic characters and objects from George Lucas' universe with its kitchen gear.\n\nThe Star Wars x Le Creuset Collection will launch exclusively at select Le Creuset boutique stores, at the online Le Creuset store, and at Yuppiechef on November 1st.\n\nAvailable for purchase, the line includes novelty products that fans of the series will immediately recognize, like this Han Solo Carbonite Signature Roaster (available in South Africa for R6,550) inspired by \"Star Wars: Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.\" Harrison Ford himself might be impressed by the likeness.\n\nIf the roaster is out of your price range or just a little too difficult for you to look at daily, you may be more interested in the robot Mini Cocottes (R435 each), which you can use for cooking smaller dishes. R2-D2, C-3PO, and BB-8 each have a unique design.\n\nBut fans of the dark side can enjoy some kitchen fun, too.\n\nThe Darth Vader Round casserole (R5,750) and Death Star Trivet (R290) are both fit for a Sith Lord.\n\nThere's also a Millenium Falcon Trivet (R290), which you can see below next to the Death Star Trivet.\n\nBut only a select few superfans will be able to purchase the Tatooine Round Dutch Oven (R14,000), inspired by the desert island of the same name that's famous in the \"Star Wars\" universe. Only nine Tatooine casseroles have been created worldwide, but you can sign up for a chance to purchase one here on Le Creuset's website.\n\nVisit Le Creuset's website to see the full \"Star Wars\" cookware collection.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:\n\n\n\n", "description": "Le Creuset's new collection includes the Darth Vader casserole, Millennium Falcon Trivet, R2-D2 Mini Cocotte, and more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7756/f17272886e4b4bffa2e36488a2fd7292.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
