(Twitter, @jairbolsonaro)\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will need four days more than planned to recover from abdominal surgery, his spokesperson said on Thursday.\n\n\"The president of the republic's team of doctors has decided to keep him away from the exercise of his duties... four additional days, from September 13, to give him a longer period to recover,\" said Otavio Rego Barros, his spokesperson.\n\n\"The state of the president's health... is evolving positively,\" he added.\n\nBarros had earlier said that Bolsonaro would return to work on Friday, though he would still be feeding via a nasogastric tube due to intestinal problems which prevented him from taking food normally after the surgery.\n\nBolsonaro, 64, underwent a five-hour operation on Sunday to repair an abdominal hernia, leaving Vice President Hamilton Mourao as acting president during his recovery.\n\nThe procedure on Bolsonaro took two hours longer than anticipated. It was his fourth operation since being stabbed in the stomach a year ago at a campaign rally.\n\nOn Monday, the president broadcast a video of himself on Twitter walking along a hospital corridor, and was also able to ingest liquid food.\n\nThursday, he posted a photo of himself standing besides his doctors, with the nasogastric tube inserted.\n\nBolsonaro is due to fly to New York later this month to address the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro will need four days more than planned to recover from abdominal surgery, his spokesperson has said.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7518/82d6dc875b3b49478eb56f148b016d9f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
