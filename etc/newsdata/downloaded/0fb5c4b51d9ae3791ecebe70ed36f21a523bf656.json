Jones heading for the end zone in the fourth quarter \u2026 and another desperation heave on the next series that Bills safety Jordan Poyer pulled in as if he were the intended receiver. There was the swing pass he spiked into Saquon Barkley\u2019s feet, the pass that sailed several yards wide of Jones that drew the jeers of the crowd \u2026 and the tipped-pass interception when the Giants were on the move late in the first half that left head coach Pat Shurmur staring in disbelief.\n\nAnd on three straight third-quarter possessions, the Giants defense stopped the Bills cold and turned it back to the Giants offense, which could not manage to score a single point in response.\n\nThat also may not have been totally Eli Manning\u2019s fault.\n\nBut when you are the face of a franchise that has begun its season with two humiliating losses, and the leader of an offense that has managed to score just 31 points in those two games, pretty much everything is perceived to be your fault.\n\nAnd whether it is fair or not, that is where the fingers of many of the 74,569 fans were being pointed on Sunday at Met Life Stadium.\n\nEli Manning looks on after the Buffalo Bills defeat the New York Giants 28-14 at MetLife Stadium. (Getty Images)\n\nNot only were the fingers pointed, but so were the questions.\n\nAfter the Giants\u2019 28-14 loss to the Bills \u2014 the only undefeated New York football team \u2014 Shurmur was asked point blank if it was time to think about taking a shot with Daniel Jones, who the Giants chose with the No. 6 pick in this year\u2019s draft.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a conversation for right now,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to get better.\u201d\n\nWith that deft non-answer, the Giants\u2019 second-year coach at least proved himself move elusive than his 38-year-old quarterback.\n\nAsked to assess Manning\u2019s performance, Shurmur said, \u201cI think his play is indicative of how our team played. There were some really good plays in there and there were some things we need to improve.\u201d\n\nThe full-blown New York quarterback controversy, every tabloid headline writer and talk-show host\u2019s dream, may not have begun yet. But it is certainly on the way.\n\nThe truth is, while it is hardly only Eli Manning\u2019s fault that the Giants have started the season so poorly, the 15-year veteran and two-time Super Bowl MVP is certainly part of the problem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to make better throws and better decisions and find a way to convert on third downs,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThat\u2019s a quarterback\u2019s job.\u201d\n\nToo often on Sunday, it appeared as if Manning was no longer up to that job. It was obvious from the opening drive of the game, when the Giants used five straight running plays, including a 20-yard end around by Bennie Fowler, a backup wideout pressed into service due to all the injuries to the regulars, and a 27-yard burst by Saquon Barkley that gave the Giants an early 7-0 lead.\n\nIn fact, Manning did not even get to attempt a pass until the Giants\u2019 seventh offensive play of the game, and did not complete one until there were nearly two minutes gone in the second quarter. It was almost as if Shurmur was trying to keep the ball out of Manning\u2019s hands for as long as possible.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get Saquon involved as much as we could until the score got to the way it was,\u201d Shurmur said. \u201cUltimately we didn\u2019t make enough plays to win.\u201d\n\nThat also might have been Manning\u2019s fault. He did throw a couple of good passes, especially the perfectly lofted pass to T.J. Jones in the back of the end zone early in the fourth quarter that cut Buffalo\u2019s lead to 21-14.\n\nBut he would miss on his next five passes, and after that touchdown, the Giants would manage just three more first downs. Manning finished 26 for 45 for 250 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Clearly, he is no longer a feared playmaker in the Giants offense.\n\nThat is now the sole territory of Barkley, who rushed for over 100 yards \u2013 107 on 18 carries \u2013 for the second straight game. But once Buffalo figured out the obvious, that if you stop Barkley you stop the Giants offense, the game was as good as over.\n\nThe Bills held Barkley to 38 yards on nine carries in the second half.\n\n\u201cYou could see they were a little more focused on the running game,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cThat\u2019s life. I think a lot of teams will do that the rest of the season. They\u2019ll try to take away our running game. I think Eli did a great job of answering but we just got to answer better.\u201d\n\nAt this stage of his career, Eli Manning may no longer be able to come up with those answers.\n\nAsked to describe his feelings about the beginning of the Giants season, Manning said, \u201cIt\u2019s not the way you want to start.\u201d\n\nAs he nears the end of an admirable career, Eli Manning might have added this: It\u2019s not the way you want to finish, either.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Eli Manning isn\u2019t solely to blame for the Giants 0-2 start, but he\u2019s not helping things either.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5_ue62fo5qW2MCt.Jwa36g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04OTAuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Btlnkjn9IPCZzTJRfMfBLQ--~B/aD0yMjQ0O3c9MzIyMztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/ea0a1110-d812-11e9-b67e-47ad54b2058d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
