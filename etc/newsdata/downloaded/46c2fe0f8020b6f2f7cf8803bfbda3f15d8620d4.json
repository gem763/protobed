He termed the delay a goodwill gesture made at the request of Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, as Oct. 1 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nThe planned tariff increases were to cover largely nonconsumer items\u2014materials businesses use to produce goods\u2014with the levy going from 25% to 30%. The tariff hikes were widely opposed by U.S. business groups as well as farmers, who have suffered heavy losses as China has cut off purchases of American soybeans, corn and other crops.\n\nThe announcement came as Chinese and American officials plan to hold trade talks in Washington in early October.\n\nThe U.S. on Sept. 1 imposed new tariffs on about $111 billion in products, including for the first time some consumer goods imported from China. Another round of tariffs set to take effect Dec. 15 would cover consumer goods extensively, including smartphones, toys and apparel.\n\nWhen China announced it would retaliate against those tariffs, Mr. Trump said he would respond by raising tariff levels and added in a tweet that American companies are \u201chereby ordered\u201d to look for an alternative to doing business in China. He touted emergency powers that would allow him to punish businesses abroad.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How do you think this delay in tariffs will affect the upcoming trade talks between the U.S. and China? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe threats against companies led to a market decline at the time as well a major campaign by the business community to influence Mr. Trump to slow any escalation of the trade war, according to a person familiar with the effort.\n\nThe White House has faced criticism for taxing imports through tariffs amid some signs of economic weakness. Since the business backlash following the tweet, the Trump administration has sought to de-escalate the trade war, the person said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, China\u2019s State Council released two lists of U.S. products that will be exempt from higher tariffs starting Sept. 17.\n\nFor the 12 types of imports on the first list, including shrimp, lubricants, alfalfa meal and other items, the Chinese cabinet\u2019s tariff commission said companies can apply for a refund on additional tariffs already imposed.\n\nThe four products on the second list, the commission said, would not be eligible for refunds. It said it would continue to review goods for exemption and announce them at a later date.\n\nHigher tariffs on these goods were imposed last July as part of tit-for-tat punitive tariffs.\n\n\u2014Grace Zhu in Beijing contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nAn earlier version of this article misspelled reporter Catherine Lucey\u2019s last name as Lucy.
