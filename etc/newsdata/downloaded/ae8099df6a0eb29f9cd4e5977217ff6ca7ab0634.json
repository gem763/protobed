It referenced Donald Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader, reportedly the president of Ukraine, and a promise he may have made. (The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that during a July phone call, Trump repeatedly pressed Ukraine\u2019s president to pursue discredited corruption allegations surrounding the business dealings of Joe Biden\u2019s eldest son in the country. There was no quid pro quo discussed during the conversation, according to the report. Trump has dismissed the complaint and the news storm surrounding it as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cpartisan,\u201d and has denied wrongdoing.) Atkinson reviewed the complaint, and deemed that it was credible and met the whistle-blower statute\u2019s definition of urgent concern. He then passed it to Trump\u2019s acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire. And that\u2019s when the process ground to a halt.\n\nRead: It\u2019s happening in plain sight\n\nMaguire was supposed to pass the complaint to Congress. Instead, he has held onto it after consultations with the Justice Department, arguing that the complaint may contain privileged communications. The controversy first came into public view last week, when Adam Schiff, the Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee, revealed that Maguire was refusing to send the complaint his way.\n\nMaguire\u2019s argument is on shaky legal ground. But it points to a problem: It\u2019s hard to get around the authorities.\n\nFor instance, whistle-blowers from the intelligence community could go directly to Congress with their concerns, but in doing so they would lose whistle-blower protections afforded to them under the law. They could be fired, for example, or demoted, or lose their clearance. They could be outed.\n\nIf there is a case of reprisals against the whistle-blower by their superiors, meanwhile, then the case is decided by the DNI. Such cases are full of legal and administrative hurdles and can take years to play out. \u201cSo the very agency that is being accused of the misconduct sits as the prosecutor, judge, and jury, so to speak, on the whistle-blower\u2019s retaliation case,\u201d Colapinto said.\n\nRead: It\u2019s 2016 all over again\n\nAdvocates and lawyers have in the past raised two potential remedies to this problem: Create a legally protected channel for whistle-blowers to go to Congress on their own, or a way to let their complaints reach federal court. Neither has been adopted into law, however.\n\nThe recent complaint, Colapinto told me, shows why the congressional outlet for whistle-blowers is so important. Ideally, he said, their complaints could be brought directly to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, whose members hold security clearances and are well versed in dealing with classified material. \u201cThey are perfectly \u2026 capable of handling classified information. That\u2019s how they\u2019re set up,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do it all the time.\u201d", "description": "As the country learned this week, authorities have too much power to decide the fate of whistle-blower claims, especially when they involve the intelligence community.", "authors": ["Mike Giglio"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2Q1P4/facebook.jpg?1569013965", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
