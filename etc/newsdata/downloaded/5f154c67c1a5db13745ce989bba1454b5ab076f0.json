Democrats latched onto Mulvaney\u2019s statements as further evidence of what they consider White House wrongdoing out in the open.\n\n\u201cHe was deeply, deeply unhelpful,\u201d said another House GOP aide.\n\nIt was a self-inflicted pile-on for the acting chief of staff, whose relationship with the president already had been tenuous and who typically prides himself on his communication skills. It gave Mulvaney\u2019s detractors in the West Wing ammunition to speak ill of him to the president and sideline him even more from the impeachment response and strategy.\n\n\u201cThose who have their knives out for him are happy, but I am not sure what the president\u2019s read on it was. We will know more today,\u201d said one White House official, who described the West Wing as quiet Friday morning following the president\u2019s Dallas rally on Thursday night and the vice president\u2019s late return from Turkey.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s performance raised questions with Trump allies about whether the White House team was properly prepared to fight impeachment. \u201cThere\u2019s growing concern \u2014 whether it\u2019s other advisers, whether the legal team is not coordinating and communicating with the rest of the team well enough,\u201d a Republican close to the White House said. \u201cThere are questions about who\u2019s doing what and who\u2019s responsible.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s top spokesperson maintained that it\u2019s business as usual in the building for Mulvaney and the rest of the staff. \u201cThis will not affect his role at all,\u201d White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. \u201cWe all work at the White House as one team.\u201d\n\nTrump on Thursday, asked about the Mulvaney appearance, said he had not seen it yet but told reporters \u201cI have a lot of confidence\u201c in Mulvaney.\n\nHis campaign, borrowing a line from Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing, began selling T-shirts on Friday with the phrase \u201cGet Over It\u201d emblazoned across the front.\n\n\u201cAmericans should call their members of Congress and tell them: get over it and get back to work!\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement accompanying the latest Trump merchandise debut.\n\nMulvaney has emerged as a key focal point in the Ukraine scandal in recent days through both congressional testimony and reporting. This has given a new, darker sheen to Mulvaney\u2019s West Wing management mantra, \u201cLet Trump be Trump.\u201d In hindsight, his approach appears to have been more of a facilitator, someone who \u201cHelps Trump Be Trump,\u201d said one White House adviser.\n\nMulvaney was involved in the decision to withhold aid to Ukraine. His national security aide, Robert Blair, reportedly listened in on the president\u2019s July 25 call with the Ukraine president, a conversation which one Mulvaney ally called \u201cappropriate.\u201d A former top national security aide told congressional lawmakers this week that the former National Security Adviser John Bolton had objected to Mulvaney\u2019s involvement in the shadow Ukraine foreign policy spearheaded by Rudy Giuliani, saying, \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d\n\nMulvaney only put himself deeper into the Ukraine scandal on Thursday, when he told reporters at a formal press briefing the president wanted to withhold aid until Ukraine agreed to investigate corruption. Mulvaney later walked back those statements, saying \u201cthe president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d\n\nRepublican lawmakers were not sold on his about-face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an etch a sketch,\u201d Republican Rep. Francis Rooney of Florida said about Mulvaney\u2019s comments. \u201cIt is kind of hard to argue that he didn\u2019t say it, right? if I understood it correctly, he basically cleared up what was a matter of some vagueness that he basically said it was a quid pro quo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hold up foreign aid that we had previously appropriated for a political initiative. Period,\u201d added Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski.\n\nNor were lawyers. The White House counsel\u2019s office, the Department of Justice and the president\u2019s private lawyer Jay Sekulow all quickly distanced themselves publicly and privately from Mulvaney. Sekulow made it publicly clear he was not consulted, saying in a statement, \u201cThe President\u2019s legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney\u2019s press briefing.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom a legal standpoint, the entire defense is totally shattered by Mulvaney\u2019s admission,\u201d said a Republican close to the White House. \u201cIt like admitting guilt and then saying, \u2018It\u2019s just not that serious.\u2019\u201d\n\nA former administration official said the entire episode could have been avoided if the president wasn\u2019t so paranoid about his closest aides and advisers. Though it was unclear if Mulvaney volunteered to conduct the briefing \u2014 which began with him announcing the location of next year\u2019s G-7 summit \u2014 or if he was personally asked to get in front of the cameras, the official said Trump was undoubtedly monitoring his chief of staff\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: This was a loyalty test for Mick,\u201d the former official said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out soon enough if he passed or failed.\u201d\n\nOthers warned that Mulvaney became a walking target on Thursday in the event that Trump \u2014 who just this week dismissed his former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as \u201coverrated\u201d \u2014 begins searching for a fall guy. The president\u2019s relationship with his top aide has rarely been seamless and has only grown worse in recent weeks as Mulvaney\u2019s West Wing colleagues have questioned whether he\u2019s equipped to guide the White House through impeachment and the near-universal outrage over Trump\u2019s abrupt decision last week to pull U.S. troops away from the Turkey-Syria border.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a stressed president right now and he\u2019s going to take it out on people,\u201d said a person close to Mulvaney, who suggested that Trump has no reason to be concerned about the former congressman\u2019s fealty.\n\n\u201cIf Trump said, \u2018I need you to be the fall guy,\u2019 he would probably say, \u2018fine,\u2018\u201d the person said.\n\nMelanie Zanona and Daniel Lippman contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3d/65/c0abfcb749a78e55f89c316c22eb/191018-mick-mulvaney-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
