REUTERS/Staff/File Photo\n\nEuropean stocks [.EU] and the euro [FRX/] both suffered shaky starts as euro zone manufacturing data showed the sharpest contraction in almost seven years, but it was by no means the only alarm bell ringing.\n\nAustralia's dollar AUD=D4 had tumbled overnight after its central bank cut interest rates in its trade war-hit economy for the third time this year. That in turn dragged the neighboring Kiwi dollar NZD=D4 to a 4-year low.\n\n\u201cOn we go with the dollar,\u201d said Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes. \u201cIt is the pick of the major economies and I don\u2019t think anything is going to change (for the dollar) until the economy slows.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you are very sensitive to global trade and sensitive to manufacturing you are having a very tough time of it at the moment, there is no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nThe dollar index .DXY against a basket of major currencies rose 0.2% to 99.585, its highest level since May 2017.\n\nBond markets were also grumbling after a weak auction of Japanese government debt underscored the lack of enthusiasm for the negative interest rates that more and more countries will be heading toward if economies and inflation stay weak.\n\nThat worry fed across to higher bond yields across major markets, with 10-year German, French and Spanish and U.S Treasury yields all up 2 to 4 basis points. [GVD/EUR]\n\nEconomic surprise indexes published by Citigroup for the United States and Europe .CESIUSD, .CESIEUR showed an increased divergence.
