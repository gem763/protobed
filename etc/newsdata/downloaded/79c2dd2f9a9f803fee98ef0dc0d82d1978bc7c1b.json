They\u2019ve sold squillions of records, taken almost as many drugs, had rows on stage, split up, reunited and buried one of their two lead singers. But until now they had never performed their most famous album in full. Welcome to the Hotel California.\n\nWith whole-album gigs, half the trick is in the timing, and they\u2019ve got that right. Released in 1976, Hotel California was not just a classic LP but a critique of the USA as her 200th birthday approached. Its themes, from over-consumption to the drawbacks of the American Dream, are all too relevant today.\n\nIn Las Vegas, the Eagles have been performing their album Hotel California in full and at 72, Don Henley (above) has a few creaks in his voice, which only add to the impact\n\nIn a perfect world this concert would be taking place in Laurel Canyon, in some vast natural amphitheatre, with old hippies free to come and go. Instead it\u2019s in Las Vegas, which, though full of music, is not known for its philosophical soft rock.\n\nStill, it does share LA\u2019s palm trees, pale sunsets and a taste for doomed hedonism. And it knows how to put on a show.\n\nWith 31 million copies sold, Hotel California is third on Wikipedia\u2019s certified list of all-time bestselling albums, behind Thriller by Michael Jackson (47 million) and Their Greatest Hits (41 million), also by the Eagles. Most of those hits will feature tonight too, but they\u2019re tour staples that rang out around Wembley Stadium only this summer. So the show is really about one album.\n\nIt starts with an actor in a cape doing something that was commonplace in 1976, but now feels exotic: lowering an LP on to a turntable. Hotel California the album opens with Hotel California the single.\n\nSlowish, stately, six minutes long, it\u2019s not a natural show-starter but works because, with its different moods, it\u2019s a gig in miniature. At 72, Don Henley has a few creaks in his voice, which add to the impact, like peeling paint. It would take a spine of stone not to tingle.\n\nIT'S A FACT That most archetypally Californian of bands was made up of members from Nebraska, Texas, Detroit and Kansas.\n\nThe album is front-loaded, starting with three hits. Vince Gill, the country singer who\u2019s been the Eagles\u2019 guest star since 2017, stands in for the late Glenn Frey on New Kid In Town and exudes easy warmth. (Frey\u2019s son Deacon is on stage too, but his moment comes later.) Henley returns for Life In The Fast Lane, his vocals sparring with Joe Walsh\u2019s riff. Part of the Eagles\u2019 secret is the way they use rock guitars: maximum fun, minimum bombast.\n\nThe lesser-known tracks are like loving parents giving a shy child a boost. Halfway through Wasted Time the lights behind the band go up to reveal an orchestra with a white-haired conductor \u2013 Jim Ed Norman, who did the original string arrangements. \u2018We met in college in 1968,\u2019 Henley says proudly. Typical: the musician he\u2019s stayed friends with the longest is one who wasn\u2019t in the Eagles.\n\nHotel California culminates in The Last Resort, making only its tenth live appearance in 43 years. \u2018She packed her hopes and dreams,\u2019 Henley sings, \u2018like a refugee.\u2019 Half folk song, half history lesson, The Last Resort shows America what she\u2019s made of.\n\nBy now the orchestra has been joined by a choir. The Eagles\u2019 sound, with its glowing harmonies, barely needs them, but they add to the sense of occasion \u2013 and the delight of the crowd. I\u2019ve never seen so many songs receive a standing ovation.\n\nIt\u2019s a memorable evening that deserves a wider audience than the 40,000-odd who witnessed one of the three nights in Vegas. The video relay, shot mostly with unmanned cameras, was strikingly sharp, which makes you wonder if the Eagles will do the show as a Netflix special, like Springsteen On Broadway. Or they could go one better than The Boss and turn it into a world tour.", "description": "The Eagles have done just about everything.
