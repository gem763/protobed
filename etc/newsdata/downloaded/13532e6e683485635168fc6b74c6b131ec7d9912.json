Five days earlier, Miranda Schaup-Werner also died of pulmonary edema, as well internal hemorrhaging and an enlarged heart, authorities said.\n\nThe State Department announced the results of their toxicology reports on Friday and alerted the deceased\u2019s family as well as the Dominican officials.\n\n\u201cMethanol poisoning from tainted alcohol was ruled out by the FBI in these cases during the toxicology screening, and it was not the finding in any other cases of U.S. citizen deaths investigated by Dominican authorities,\u201d the State Department said.\n\nSteven E. Bullock, an attorney representing Holmes and Day, remained skeptical over his clients\u2019 death, according to the New York Times.\n\n\u201cYou had a couple that died of the same ailment at the same time, and they want to say that it\u2019s natural causes,\u201d Bullock told the Times. \u201cI think there\u2019s something for us to continue to look into.\u201d", "description": "The FBI is conducting toxicology tests on three of the deceased Americans.
