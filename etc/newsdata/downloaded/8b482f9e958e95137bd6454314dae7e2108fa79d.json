Most candidates back impeachment\n\nSyria pullout\n\nWhile foreign policy does not always take center stage at debates, the candidates are likely going to face questions on Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, which Democrats and Republicans have both criticized. The move is seen by critics as an abandonment of U.S. Kurdish allies that will put their lives at risk.\n\nAffording higher education\n\nStudent loan and debt forgiveness have been frequently discussed on the campaign trail. Warren and Sanders have both proposed four free years of college education. Biden released his plan proposing two free years of college education last week, and the two progressive senators could see an opening to hit the former vice president on that plan.\n\nHealth care\n\nHealth care is shaping up to be the biggest policy debate in the party. Biden clashed with Warren and Sanders on the issue at the last debate, defending the Affordable Care Act in the face of progressive proposals to scrap it in favor of \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nDrugs\n\nDemocrats could also address the ongoing opioid crisis in the U.S., which has hit Ohio especially hard. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the state was home to the nation\u2019s highest per capita rate of opioid overdoses in 2017.\n\nVaping\n\nVaping and e-cigarettes could also come up during the debate, amid a growing number of deaths related to the practice.\n\nJobs and the economy\n\nTrump promised to revamp Ohio\u2019s manufacturing and agricultural sector in 2016. However, Democrats say that the president has not made good on those promises in the state. Expect the Democratic candidates to push their own economic messages at the debate.\n\nWho won\u2019t be there?\n\n-Sen.
