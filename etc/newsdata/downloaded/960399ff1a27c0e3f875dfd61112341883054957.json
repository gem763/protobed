Get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.\u201d\n\nLabour whips managed to hold down the number of rebels. Two Labour MPs \u2013 John Mann and Kate Hoey \u2013 voted with the government, while two others \u2013 Kevin Barron and Derek Twigg \u2013 abstained.\n\nPlay Video 2:03 Johnson says he will seek snap election after losing crucial vote \u2013 video\n\nStarmer tweeted: \u201cHugely important first step in stopping Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a no-deal Brexit. Important we remain united in making sure the bill becomes law in the coming days.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Labour\u2019s leader and the shadow Brexit secretary were examining plans which might avoid leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October, as threatened by the prime minister.\n\nIt is understood that Labour wanted to use parliamentary procedure to force the Conservatives to hold an election on a particular date, instead of giving Johnson an option of moving it until after 1 November.\n\nLabour\u2019s chief whip, Nick Brown, told the parliamentary Labour party that they would not back the prime minister\u2019s snap election plans if it might lead to a no-deal Brexit.\n\nClive Efford, the MP for Eltham, asked Brown about comments from Tony Blair in which the former Labour prime minister said supporting a general election would be an \u201celephant trap\u201d because it would give the government a free hand to change the polling date during an election campaign.\n\nJeremy Corbyn 'will be delighted' to fight general election Read more\n\nBrown was applauded by a packed meeting after replying that Labour would not support a general election that could lead to a no-deal Brexit, a Labour source said.\n\n\u201cThere was not that much detail, there was just an unequivocal assurance,\u201d the MP Clive Lewis said.\n\nThe choice of polling day is in the gift of the prime minister, who advises the Queen as to which date to proclaim. Johnson could, in theory, schedule an election for after no-deal, in another move that would push the bounds of convention without breaking the law.\n\nConcerns about the possible manoeuvre were raised following a rally in Salford on Monday night, when Corbyn said: \u201cI will be delighted when the election comes. I\u2019m ready for it, you\u2019re ready for it \u2013 we\u2019ll take that message out there and above all we will win.\u201d\n\nHis enthusiasm caught some Labour frontbenchers by surprise, after a meeting of key opposition figures last week at which it was agreed the first priority was legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOne shadow minister told the Guardian it would be \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d to agree to an election before 31 October \u2013 but another claimed the doubts about an election emanated from MPs who were sceptical about Corbyn\u2019s leadership.\n\n\u201cSome of the people saying, \u2018we can\u2019t have a general election\u2019, are just frightened Jeremy will actually win,\u201d one shadow minister said.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Corbyn suggested his party would back a general election \u2013 but only if it could also block a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAfter another cross-bench meeting, Corbyn said: \u201cLabour wants to prevent a no-deal Brexit, and to have a general election, so we can end austerity and invest in our communities. I am confident we can have both, and we\u2019ve been in discussions about a way to achieve this.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Johnson succeeds in forcing a general election, few at Westminster doubt that one is likely in the coming weeks and months, and Labour MPs are turning their minds to the contest ahead.\n\nThere is likely to be a lively debate about whether the party\u2019s manifesto should leave open the possibility of going ahead with Brexit.\n\nLabour MPs in leave-voting areas were targeted by party whips seeking to defeat the government.\n\nLeave supporter MP Ronnie Campbell, who has rebelled against Labour several times and backed the government on Brexit, said: \u201cI\u2019m a leaver, there\u2019s no doubt about it \u2013 but on this I\u2019m half and half.\u201d", "description": "Labour leader warns Boris Johnson his MPs will only vote for election once no-deal off table", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal", "Heather Stewart", "Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/161729be26e748a9935d24b161e894cbd3cf807d/408_2_1592_955/master/1592.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a2393756982709f9f2f28392db6820b2"}
