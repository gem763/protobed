When James Taylor sat down to write about the childhood sweetheart who had finally agreed to be his girl, which vegetable metaphor did he plump for?\n\nThe sweet potato. That\u2019s right. \u201cOh Lord, I feel fine today,\u201d he crooned on his 1988 album Never Die Young. \u201cI\u2019m walking on cloud nine today \u2026\u201d\n\nWhy, you ask. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to tell you why,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt\u2019s strictly on account of my sweet potato pie.\u201d\n\nAlthough few women would be delighted to be compared, however loosely, to a dish made with starchy tubers, Taylor does a decent job of selling it, and its main ingredient. It is tender, he says, it\u2019s sweet, it\u2019s soft and deep; it\u2019s soulful.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a slow-roasted batch of this succulent vegetable, you\u2019ll know he\u2019s right. Sweet potatoes \u2013 now at the peak of their season \u2013 are the business.\n\nThey are also big business. Over the past decade, according to Kantar Worldpanel, demand for sweet potatoes in the UK has quadrupled. For a while, they mostly came from warmer climes \u2013 North Carolina, Israel \u2013 but in 2015, farmers in Kent pulled out all the stops to put a UK-grown crop in the supermarkets. That same year, the Office for National Statistics included the sweet potato in the illustrative shopping basket it uses to measure inflation. And last year, consumer research showed most people would opt for a sweet potato side dish over a straight-up potato one. Yet most of us have only begun to plumb those tender, sweet, soulful depths.\n\nFirst up, sweet potatoes don\u2019t have to be orange. Those Kentish farmers chose to cultivate the familiar red-skinned, flame-fleshed variety, often known as yams in the southern US. But if you have a Caribbean market stall or an Asian grocer nearby, you can probably get hold of something different. There are purple sweet potatoes, white sweet potatoes, yellow sweet potatoes. With the variations in colour come differences in texture, density, flavour and uses. The food website Saveur has a tantalising guide to 16 kinds, from the tan-skinned hannah, which bakes into a soft, dry yellow, perfect for mashing, to korean purple, with its white flesh and magenta exterior yielding a subtle chestnut flavour. If you can, try them all.\n\nSweet potato fries or baked wedges are, it would appear, the thing that has pushed the root veg into the mainstream. And it is hard to argue with them. The food writer Anna Jones recommends coating wedges in polenta before baking \u2013 it crisps them up nicely. She serves hers with a chipotle yoghurt dipping sauce. If you want to deep-fry yours, Felicity Cloake cautions that they are best thick-cut, par-boiled (with a little bicarb) and coated in a cornflour paste (she spikes hers with paprika), then rolled in cornmeal.\n\nThere is, however, more to sweet potatoes than chips. The Mississippi-born chef Brad McDonald, in his book Deep South, does a smoked pork belly served with a spiced sweet potato casserole topped with pecan praline and Italian meringue. Yotam Ottolenghi mixes them, roasted, with pickled onion, coriander and goat\u2019s cheese as an accompaniment to fish or chicken. Vegans and \u201cclean-eaters\u201d, meanwhile, routinely tout the virtues of the sweet potato just as much as any meat eater.\n\nDepending, of course, on what you load them up with, sweet potatoes are a healthier option than conventional potatoes. They are lower in carbohydrates and calories, and higher in fibre and vitamin A. Their sweetness marries with a host of aromatics \u2013 from paprika to cinnamon, thyme to cumin and coriander. And their creaminess suggests all manner of pairings: sour cream, salsa verde, miso, chilli. Nigel Slater steams slices to make a fragrant split orange lentil dal that he serves with fresh coriander. And Melissa Hemsley uses chunks as the base for a lemongrass-infused chickpea and coconut curry. Sweet potatoes also make an excellent starting point for a soup, a stew, a bake or a pie.\n\nThe traditional sweet potato pie \u2013 a Thanksgiving classic \u2013 is made with butter, flavoured with vanilla and cinnamon, encased in shortcrust and served with whipped cream. Deb Perelman of the Smitten Kitchen blog went through a southern food infatuation, as she put it, a few years back, but hankered after something a little lighter for afters. She found it in the Lee Brothers\u2019 buttermilk sweet potato pie \u2013 more cheesecake than stodge.\n\nTanya Harris, of the My Forking Life blog, does a mean vegan take on the trad Jamaican sweet potato pudding using coconut milk, brown sugar and allspice, but forgoing the rum you would find in other recipes. Jamaican sweet potatoes are of the denser kind, meaning the pudding is more cake-like. But even if you only have orange jewel sweet potatoes and have to spoon the resulting bake into a bowl, it will still be delicious.\n\nThen there are the many Japanese sweets to be made with the vegetable. The most popular is a double-baked beauty: sweet potato puree with butter, sugar, cream and egg. A scattering of black sesame seeds on top, and you\u2019re golden.\n\nMostly though, it\u2019s best to remember that the sweet potato doesn\u2019t need much doing to it to be perfect. It is one of those culinary failsafes, a foil to every kitchen foible. There are vendors in Japan who park vans on street corners and belt out: \u201cIshi yaki imo\u201d, which means stone-baked sweet potato. That is all they are selling. One bite of the piping-hot tat wrapped in newspaper and you\u2019re sold. You\u2019re going home to rustle up more of the same in a hot, hot oven. Slow-roasting the potato in its skin means the moisture is retained and the sugars in the skin caramelise. As savoury as it is sweet, this is a whole warming meal for cold hands on a winter\u2019s day. And that\u2019s something to sing about.", "description": "Britons prefer them to traditional tatties, but we\u2019ve hardly begun to plumb their tender depths \u2013 there\u2019s much more to them than fancy chips or Thanksgiving pie", "authors": ["Dale Berning Sawa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed8cbae8fd9115ddceaed75f83221b5b83d90b2/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1be4beba2e5c161c93f9918ab845ce2f", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
