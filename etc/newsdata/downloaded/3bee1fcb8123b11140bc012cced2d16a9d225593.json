And as the year turns, our thoughts turn to how to optimize for the new season with the latest smart home technology.\n\n\n\nBelow, some futuristic tech to make the most of your fall.\n\n\n\nKobi\n\n\n\nWhile fantastic foliage may be the hallmark of fall, leaves lose a lot of their luster as soon as they leave the tree and lie all over your lawn. Autumn yard maintenance is a time-consuming and repetitive task, so why not employ a helper who has no concept of tedium? The Kobi is an automated leaf blower that will patrol your perimeter (and everything in between) as soon as the first dead plant drops to keep your yard clean and clear. And while you can control Kobi via a smartphone app, the autumn-minded automaton is more than capable of taking care of itself, deploying whenever it detects work needs to be done and heading back to its charger whenever it needs a bit more juice. Kobi is no one-season slouch either\u2014the robot can also operate as an automated snow blower and automated lawn mower.\n\n\n\nKobi costs $3,999.\n\n\n\nHelios Lounge\n\n\n\nHelios Lounge\n\nWith fall comes falling temperatures and an end to evenings spent enjoying the outdoors\u2014unless you are prepared.

Like a hot tub soak without any of the pesky water, the Helios Lounge will help extend your outdoor entertaining well into winter.

Alchema owners simply select a recipe via the accompanying smart phone app, add the appropriate ingredients, and the appliance takes care of the rest. Via the Alchema app, cider makers can track each stage of the fermentation process\u2014or they can sit back and just wait for the notification that drinks are ready. And if cider is not your speed\u2014don\u2019t worry, the Alchema is capable of brewing wine, beer and mead too.\n\n\n\nThe Alchema is available for $399.\n\n\n\nCoway Mighty AP-1512HH\n\n\n\nCoway Mighty AP-1512HH\n\nWhile spring may be the biggest culprit when it comes to allergies, fall is no slouch when it comes to sneeze-inducing seasonal particles. Ragweed, mold and dust mites can play havoc with the olfactory glands of allergy sufferers but The Mighty from Coway is here to help. The smart air purifier offers a four-stage filtration process to reduce airborne odors and contaminants\u2014and it does so automatically. The Mighty continually monitors air quality and kicks into gear, with the appropriate fan speed and filtering, as soon as it detects damaging pollutants in the atmosphere. When the Mighty feels the air is appropriately cleaned, it puts itself to bed via an energy-saving Eco Mode, only to awake when it once again perceives a pollutant.\n\n\n\nThe Coway Mighty AP-1512HH is available for $252.99\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["John Elliot"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-114480?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
