It did not give details of the pricing.\n\nIFR News reported the launch was increased from a planned $400 million to $425 million, priced at 8.125%.", "description": "Virgin Australia issues $425 million notes to fund Velocity acquisition", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9N242_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
