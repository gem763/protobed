She drives our writer through LA to talk Donald Trump, existential angst and her anthem called Air BnB\n\nBefore she came to typify deadpan Downtown New York cool, Kim Gordon was a teenager in 1970s Los Angeles, smoking pot and listening to Joni Mitchell. It was the pot that landed her in \u201cDisney jail\u201d. Gordon and her friend were in a cave on pirate-themed Tom Sawyer\u2019s Island, lighting up a joint, when the Disney cops swooped in.\n\n\u201cThey took us underground,\u201d Gordon recalls \u2013 to a netherworld where she saw \u201cMickey Mouse with a walkie-talkie\u201d and endured creepy comments from the officers: \u201cDoes your mother know you\u2019re not wearing a bra?\u201d\n\nGordon was left in a juvenile holding cell overnight. She was taking a political science class at the time, and her mind whirled. \u201cI was writing this paper in my head about Disneyland and how fascist it was,\u201d Gordon tells me. \u201cIt confirmed my beliefs about American consumerism.\u201d It\u2019s a belief she still holds. \u201cConsumerism is killing us,\u201d she says today.\n\nKim Gordon v Disney is an unusually revealing punk-rock folk tale: from the earliest days of Sonic Youth, the band she co-founded with her ex-husband Thurston Moore, Gordon\u2019s music, art criticism and paintings have been a kind of post-Warhol skewering of American myths. That sceptical eye extends to her first solo album, No Home Record \u2013 a bold mix of industrial noise, art-punk poetics and wry wit, which I\u2019m discussing with Gordon at her sunny home in the quiet hills of LA\u2019s Los Feliz district.\n\nOn display is a signed copy of Neil Young and Crazy Horse\u2019s Zuma; a poster for Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Made in USA; and another of Darby Crash of the Germs, who are Gordon\u2019s favourite LA punk band because of their tendency to \u201cdeconstruct\u201d on stage unexpectedly. \u201cThat\u2019s my kind of entertainment.\u201d Books cover the coffee table: Claire Denis by Judith Mayne; Black Is a Color by Elvan Zabunyan; Fascination by Kevin Killian. \u201cI used to feel this existential nausea here,\u201d Gordon says of LA. \u201cNow it\u2019s a sigh of relief.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kim Gordon in Sonic Youth with (from left) Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo and Steve Shelley. Photograph: Frans Schellekens/Redferns\n\nBefore Sonic Youth, Gordon fronted a situationist-style project focused on domestic interiors called Design Office. Once, in 2013, I watched her and the German artist Jutta Koether do a \u201cone-act play\u201d in which they read a 1991 magazine Q&A between Gordon and the late artist Mike Kelley. If a home can be conceptual art, or reciting an interview, an interview in her home could be doubly so.Gordon was always what made Sonic Youth punk: her bass and guitar; the inspired reach of her speak-sung vocals, her declaration that \u201cwomen make natural anarchists\u201d, her decades-long suggestion that things you wouldn\u2019t expect can be art. She approached the mainstream with the irreverence of the underground and, in her abstracted way, tackled grim social realities, writing songs about Karen Carpenter and body image, media misogyny and sexual harassment at Sonic Youth\u2019s record label.\n\nGordon has long regarded herself more as a visual artist than a musician. \u201cPlaying bass was never my desire,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a byproduct of wanting to make something exciting.\u201d At first, Sonic Youth were influenced by the brash extremities of the no-wave scene: \u201cIt was like a gauntlet was thrown down,\u201d Gordon says. \u201c\u2018Here, you try to make something.\u2019\u201d But in the male-dominated New York noise milieu, it was Gordon who made it seem as if anyone could pick that gauntlet up \u2013 that to be an artist you just have to begin. Her career has been an inspired testament to her own 1983 maxim that at concerts \u201cpeople pay to see others believe in themselves\u201d.\n\nGordon and Moore\u2019s divorce spelled the end of Sonic Youth. Her raw 2015 memoir, Girl in a Band, aired the details of his infidelity and their difficult divorce. \u201cWhen I first found out Thurston had a double life, seeing the texts, I was about to go to yoga,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was just looking at the time when I picked up his phone.\u201d Gordon still went to yoga.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kim Gordon\u2019s artwork on display at the London Frieze art fair, 2014.

She is co-editing a book of writing about women in music and has been consulting for the television show Daisy Jones and the Six, based on the bestselling novel about a fictional 70s band a la Fleetwood Mac. \u201cI think they want to make it darker,\u201d she says, \u201cor that useless word, \u2018authentic\u2019.\u201d\n\nGordon has lived in Los Feliz for three years, having moved from, Massachusetts, where she and Moore raised their daughter, Coco, now 25. (Gordon later gives me one of Coco\u2019s poetry zines, which includes a beautiful piece dedicated to her mother: \u201cThere\u2019s a Crack in the Carpet \u2013 There\u2019s a Dream in My Chest.\u201d) Warm though still a bit elusive, at 66, Gordon says she is still not totally comfortable giving interviews to promote her work and talking about herself: \u201cAfter a while, you feel like an imposter.\u201d One of her paintings comes to mind: the dripping words Secret Abuse, Gordon\u2019s comment on artists\u2019 relationship to the commercial world. It reminds me of artists\u2019 relationships to themselves, too, and she agrees: \u201cThe process is torture.\u201d\n\nFor her solo album, Gordon worked with an outside producer for the first time. In Gordon fashion, there is no particular reason now for making a solo album beyond the persistence of her producer, Justin Raisen. It is the first time she has worked so collaboratively with one. Raisen is an eccentric, new-age-y Angeleno by way of Long Island who says he made a habit of regularly chanting Gordon\u2019s name in the weeks before the universe conspired to bring them together: he DM\u2019d her after his brother met her at a restaurant. Gordon felt that Raisen \u2013 who has worked with Sky Ferreira and Angel Olsen \u2013 understood her \u201ctrashy, dissonant\u201d sensibility. \u201cIt was pretty casual,\u201d she says. \u201cJustin just said: \u2018Bring over your fucked-up poetry and we\u2019ll make some shit.\u2019 He was calling me Kimye.\u201d\n\nNamed after a film by Chantal Akerman, No Home Record powerfully makes the case for Gordon as an art concept herself, one who combusts notions of what music can be in order to obliquely expose the status quo. Her music feels more aligned with her visual art practice than ever \u2013 the lyrics of the vertigo-inducing Murdered Out mention matte-black spray. In her art and her music, her language is striking. She has recently painted hashtags \u2013 #Resist, #PussyGrabsBack, #YouDontOwnMe \u2013 and on No Home Record there is an abrasive anthem called Air BnB.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just subject matter,\u201d she deflects, before adding: \u201cWhat is the modern-day landscape? What is a portrait now? I\u2019m fascinated by the pictures on Airbnb, these little utopias you can try on, to escape from one\u2019s objects and life.\u201d She mentions the influence of Courbet and Manet, art depicting life happening. \u201cThe most interesting art to me is always kind of a critique of the culture,\u201d she says. \u201cTechnology gives us a false sense of confidence that everything is always evolving.\u201d\n\nWhen composing the lyrics for No Home Record, Gordon\u2019s friend, the poet Elaine Kahn, prompted her to write down words from her everyday life. She often snatched phrases while driving around LA, looking at the signs in shopping malls. The title of the thundering closing track Get Yr Life Back was a phrase from a plastic sidewalk sandwich board promoting Get Your Life Back Yoga. \u201cEverything is branded now: Get Your Life Back, Be Here Now, these slogans,\u201d she says. In the album\u2019s skittering opener, Sketch Artist, the lyric \u201cdreaming in a tent\u201d refers to LA\u2019s homeless population. I ask if she is collaging reality. \u201cA little,\u201d she says, \u201cor curating.\u201d She suggests we drive around.\n\nGordon grew up on the other side of the city, 45 minutes away, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where her father was a sociology professor. Her parents grew up during the Great Depression; Gordon says they never bought into consumer culture. She attended a laboratory school at UCLA that focused on learning-by-doing, which, Gordon says, \u201creally affected the process of how I make things\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I learned how to draw, I couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI would get stuck if I just thought of the pencil on the paper. So I thought of designing the page in lights and darks. You can get so paralysed in art making. I pretend I\u2019m doing something else.\u201d\n\nShe drives us through MacArthur Park, past Otis College of Art and Design, where she studied in the mid-70s. Other landmarks along the way include a taco stand and her favourite carwash. \u201cDoes that say Barbie Spa?\u201d she asks at one point.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gordon performing with Sonic Youth in 2001. Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns\n\nThe songs on No Home Record are also about the consequences of convenience, the breakdown of communication in relationships and the breakdown of the world. The slinking Paprika Pony features a \u201cmodern-day Adam and Eve, but they are on their cellphones\u201d. Hungry Baby is about sexual harassment \u2013 a subject Gordon broached in 1992 with Sonic Youth\u2019s Swimsuit Issue (Youth Against Fascism, from the same year, also feels upsettingly relevant again). \u201cIt was the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Gordon says. I ask if she ever had to fight for her ideas. \u201cThere\u2019s some unseen wall of faceless men that I have to climb over,\u201d she says, \u201cas if on a mission.\u201d\n\nWhen Gordon opens Get Yr Life Back with a statement about \u201cthe end of capitalism\u201d, she means that the system does not work: \u201cTrump is the ultimate capitalist, destroying everything,\u201d she says. Her wrenching conclusion \u2013 \u201cI feel bad for you / I feel bad for me\u201d \u2013 is both personal and political. \u201cPeople advocate forgiveness, which is a good thing, but the reality is different,\u201d Gordon says. \u201cYou have to look out for yourself. Even the Dalai Lama says: you can be empathetic, but you don\u2019t have to forgive someone.\u201d\n\nIn the car, I suggest that perhaps the spaciousness of the LA landscape relates to Gordon\u2019s use of space and rhythm in her vocal phrasings; The Sprawl, as Sonic Youth called it. She tells me that she recently listened to an audio version of Joan Didion\u2019s 1970 novel Play It As It Lays while driving around \u2013 the tale of an anguishing woman traversing LA\u2019s freeways alone. \u201cBleak on bleak,\u201d Gordon laughs. \u201cIt really did capture that sense of driving around LA if you weren\u2019t trying to get somewhere, but were doing a drift. And how isolating it can feel in the city.\u201d\n\nThat classic LA isolation is something she still experiences. \u201cI definitely have moments where I feel, not lonely, but the fear of being alone for ever,\u201d she says \u2013 articulating each word, slowly, with space. She\u2019ll listen to music to cope \u2013 the Steve Gunn-Truscinski duo records, lately, and Kurt Vile \u2013 which \u201ccreates its own environment\u201d, or she\u2019ll do something physical, such as weightlifting.\n\nGordon says that No Home Record\u2019s Earthquake is, in part, about that audience-performer relationship, and I ask if she still feels the way she did, decades ago, when she wrote, \u201cThe most heightened state of being female is watching people watch you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people are listening, you can feel this intense concentration, and it builds a level of trust,\u201d she says. \u201cI can be vulnerable in a way that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to be if I was just talking.\n\nAfter our MacArthur Park cruise, I wonder how it feels for her to be at another beginning. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that we work, and then we arrive somewhere, and that\u2019s true \u2013 because if you work on something for most of your life, when you get into your 50s, you build momentum, and in a way it steamrolls,\u201d Gordon says weeks later, by phone from the south of France, where she has an art show. \u201cBut maybe the Buddhism I read as a teenager rubbed off on me \u2013 I also like the idea of just always becoming.\u201d", "description": "She\u2019s the art-rock legend who made Sonic Youth punk \u2013 and now, at 66, she has made her first solo record.
