Ahead of its next season \u2014 or possible a completely new chapter \u2014 Fortnite has gone down in just about every way imaginable. It\u2019s widely believed that when the game is back up and running it will be a rebooted version featuring a brand new map.\n\nThings happened in dramatic fashion. Everything started when the meteor, which had been static in the middle of the island since its appearance at the beginning of season X, started to act up, eventually obliterating the entire map at around 2:00PM EST. Since then, players haven\u2019t been able to do little more than stare at a black hole. There have been flickers of activity, but not a whole lot has happened during that window. (If you enter the Konami code, you\u2019re at least able to play a simple Space Invaders-style mini-game while waiting.)\n\nThose who weren\u2019t able to log into the game in time for the event not only found it impossible to get into a game; the actual lobby and character screens were similarly pulled into the black hole. At one point the official Fortnite Twitter account even deleted all of its tweets, and Epic\u2019s public Trello board, which was used to track in-game issues, similarly went dark. Meanwhile, PlayStation had to issue a statement confirming that the game and all of those V-bucks you spent weren\u2019t gone for good.\n\nIt appears to be extended downtime, but one that\u2019s connected to the ever-changing Fortnite lore. The in-game event is currently being watched by millions across platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Twitter.\n\nRIP Fortnite: Battle Royale\n\n\n\nFULL LIVE REACTION TO THE END! pic.twitter.com/ifX4CJcnEK \u2014 Jack \u201cCouRage\u201d Dunlop (@CouRageJD) October 13, 2019\n\nTried logging into fortnite after the black hole, and this happened.

Prior to today\u2019s event a new storyline kicked off centered on seven travelers messing with the timeline; there were in-game missions that included collecting audiologs to learn more. (You can read them all right here.) Fortnite\u2019s in-game store even featured new emotes to either welcome the visitors or tell them to go home. On Friday, Epic tweeted out the cryptic phrase \u201cthe end is near.\u201d Today that was followed by \u201cthis is the end.", "description": "Epic\u2019s battle royale game has seen its most dramatic change yet: the island has been destroyed, and fans have been staring at a black hole, unable to play, for hours.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_USOkzBXkcZvV_iklkp57UQSzA=/0x25:1280x695/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19283884/EGx9rm7UUAA_p_W.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
