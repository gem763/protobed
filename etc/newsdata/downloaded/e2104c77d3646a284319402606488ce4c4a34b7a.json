It\u2019s really easy for brands to do what everyone else is doing. We want to go after things that are really exciting and are successful, and not just mediocre. At this point, we\u2019re not leaning into that.\u201d\n\nThe nationwide vegetarian menu will roll out Thursday at more than 7,000 of the chain\u2019s locations and comes after its successful test run in Dallas earlier this year. The menu will include the black bean Crunchwrap Supreme and black bean Quesarito, as well as the classic seven-layer burrito and bean burrito.\n\nTaco Bell\u2019s decision to implement a permanent vegetarian menu comes as other fast-food competitors like Burger King, White Castle, and KFC have been adding alternative meat products from the likes of Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods to menus. California-based Tex-Mex chain Del Taco said it sold 2 million of its meatless tacos made with a plant-based substitute from Beyond Meat two months after the launch. It was so well-received, the chain rolled out meatless burritos.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nAround 11% of Taco Bell customers follow a vegetarian diet, and that number is increasing every year, the chain confirmed. Still, the chain's No. 1-selling item is its beef crunchy taco, showing consistent demand for meat. The bean burrito is the second best-selling item.\n\nMatthews says Taco Bell's vegetarian menu will be on par with the prices of its regular meat items.", "description": "Taco Bell is launching its first-ever vegetarian menu.
