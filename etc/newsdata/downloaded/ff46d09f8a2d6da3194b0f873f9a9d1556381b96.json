Very few people produce anything for themselves. The country stopped producing a long time ago. People act like they're working, and the state acts like it pays them,\" the 46-year-old novelist and poet says.\n\n\"There's no schedule. No one ever has to be somewhere urgently. There's no traffic, and public transportation problems have made us all officially unpunctual.\"\n\nIn her novel Everyone Leaves, Guerra's heroine ends up frozen on Havana's famous seaside boulevard, the Malecon, \"stuck in the immobility of Cuba\".\n\nCuban artist Alejandro Campins also addresses the island's lethargy in his work.\n\n\"Every Cuban's subconscious is a waiting room,\" he says.\n\nStanding in line \"is in our DNA\", says port agent Daniel Rios, 36, whose job involves a lot of lining up.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201709/15/59bb8200a310d4d95c4c4a36.jpg", "published_at": "2017-04-17"}
