The five albums the Cars released from 1978 to 1984 each sold more than a million copies in the United States alone, with ubiquitous radio singles like \u201cJust What I Needed\u201d in 1978, \u201cShake It Up\u201d in 1981, \u201cYou Might Think\u201d in 1984 and \u201cDrive\u201d in 1984; \u201cJust What I Needed\u201d and \u201cDrive\u201d had lead vocals by Mr. Orr.\n\nAfter the Cars broke up in the late 1980s, Mr. Ocasek released solo albums and worked as a record executive and as a producer for bands that he admired \u2014 like the punk-era pioneers Suicide and Bad Brains \u2014 and that were admirers of the Cars, including Weezer, Bad Religion and No Doubt. The surviving Cars released a final album, \u201cMove Like This,\u201d in 2011.\n\nThe Cars were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, with a brief reunion of its surviving members joined by Scott Shriner of Weezer on bass. Inducting them into the hall, Brandon Flowers of the Killers described the band as \u201ca slick machine with a 340 V8 under the hood that ran on synergy, experimentation and a redefined cool.\u201d\n\nIn 1987, Mr. Ocasek told The New York Times, \u201cI\u2019m happy that the pop songs have a bit of a twist. When I\u2019m writing, I never know how it\u2019s going to come out. I don\u2019t think, well, I\u2019ve done a catchy one, now I can do a weird one. I read a lot of poetry, and that gives me a wide range of permission to say anything in a song \u2014 they\u2019re more twisted than I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d", "description": "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee updated classic sounds for a broader pop audience, making polished songs with sonic depth.", "authors": ["Jon Pareles"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/15ocasek/15ocasek-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
