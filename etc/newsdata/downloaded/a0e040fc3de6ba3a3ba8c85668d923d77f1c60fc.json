Called VC Cohorts, All Raise is for the first time speaking publicly about how these 12-person subgroups will give their members career guidance and, perhaps more importantly, the ability to share deals.\n\n\u201cThe idea was how do we hack the old boys\u2019 network? said Elisa Schreiber, Greylock\u2019s vice president of marketing and a member of All Raise\u2019s advisory committee. \u201cWe have to force this familiarity, connectivity among women in venture so that people are helping each other.\u201d\n\nCurrently, All Raise manages 14 active cohorts made up of 175 women. The idea is to put women with check-writing abilities, typically partners and general partners, together in groups with newer VCs, typically with an associate or principal title, paired together. These groups are expected to meet every six to eight weeks to talk shop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically like having 12 coffee chats in one evening,\u201d Impact Capital managing partner Heidi Patel, who helps oversee the VC Cohorts program, tells TechCrunch. \u201cIt\u2019s highly concentrated. It\u2019s highly efficient and everyone walks out of there feeling like they\u2019ve got a new tool in their tool kit.\u201d\n\nThe new program has already proven an effective avenue for deal sourcing. During the first VC Cohorts meeting, NEA partner Vanessa Larco found an investor to lead the Series B of one of her existing portfolio companies, an Atlanta identity and credential verification startup called Evident. That Series B lead was Aspect Ventures partner (now a founding partner at aCrew Capital) Lauren Kolodny. The two All Raise members now sit on the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\n\u201cOur cohort meetings always end with talking about portfolio companies that are currently raising,\u201d Larco said in a statement. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to share a deal with someone in my cohort, but she was an ideal investor for one of my portfolio companies.\u201d\n\nMale VCs have always had cross-firm relationships that facilitate deal-making. Women, who are much less represented \u2014 occupying only 11% of investment partner roles, according to Crunchbase News \u2014 have historically had fewer resources available to develop these critical relationships.\n\nMoving forward, All Raise will continue building and launching new products tailored for women in tech, add additional folks to the small but growing All Raise team and determine how they can better reach women outside of VC hubs.\n\n\u201cJust because you\u2019re sitting in Oklahoma doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the most amazing idea that can disrupt an entire category,\u201d Kostka said.", "description": "All Raise has established new chapters in Los Angeles and Boston.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DSC06135.jpg?w=600", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
