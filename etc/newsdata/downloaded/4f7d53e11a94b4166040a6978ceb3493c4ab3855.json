And now, one of the best receivers in the NFL history, Terrell Owens, is expressing an interest in talking with him amid his recent issues on and off the field.\n\n\"I would love to talk to (Antonio Brown) personally,\" Owens said recently, per Jennifer Lee Chan of NBC Sports Bay Area. \"We all go through life and we are going to make mistakes.
