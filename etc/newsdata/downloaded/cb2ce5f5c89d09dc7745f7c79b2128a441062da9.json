Even though Delta Air Lines (NYSE: ) and United Airlines (NASDAQ: ) reported lower-than-expected revenues, both industry heavyweights surpassed earnings estimates. Results were aided by factors like upbeat passenger revenues due to strong demand for air travel and low fuel costs.\n\nWith most airlines yet to report their numbers, through this write-up, we intend to help investors zero in on stocks in the space that are likely to report better-than-expected earnings per share in the ongoing reporting cycle despite high non-fuel costs mainly due to headwinds like the grounding of Boeing (NYSE: ) 737 MAX jets.\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper and have a look at the factors that most likely influenced the third-quarter performance of airline stocks.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that fuel prices represent a substantial input cost for any airline company. Airlines have been well served in this regard as oil prices declined 8.5% during the July-September period mainly due to the restoration of production capabilities of crude following the drone attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities in mid-September. This drop in oil prices is likely to have supported bottom-line growth in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nAdditionally, robust traffic during the summer season may have aided airlines\u2019 third-quarter performance. Upbeat demand for air travel most likely boosted passenger revenues thereby bolstering the top lines of carriers. This is because passenger revenues account for the bulk of top line of most airline companies. Affordable air fares along with a much-improved job market and rising disposable income have provided consumers an added incentive to opt for air travel.\n\nAnother factor that may aid third-quarter results for airlines is the fact that the impact of Hurricane Dorian on bookings was not as severe as anticipated initially. Low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines (NYSE: ) primarily attributed this reason for its improved third-quarter 2019 total revenue per available seat miles (TRASM: a key measure of unit revenues) projection.

As a result of economic improvement in Latin America, strong passenger revenues should bolster third-quarter results of leading carriers in the region like Azul and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (NYSE: ) .\n\nDespite the tailwinds, one needs to be mindful of the challenges posed by the prolonged grounding of Boeing 737 MAX jets. The bottom line of carriers with Boeing 737 MAX jets in their fleet is expected to reflect the impact of escalated non-fuel costs due to the grounding of the jets. For example, Southwest Airlines (NYSE: ) , which has 34 Boeing 737 MAX jets in its fleet, expects non-fuel unit costs to have increased between 8% and 10% in the third quarter. Moreover, flight cancellations due to the groundings are also likely to impact third-quarter results. For example, American Airlines (NASDAQ: ) , which canceled 9,475 flights in the July-September period due to the Boeing 737 Max groundings, expects the cancellations to hurt its pretax income to the tune of approximately $140 million.\n\nHow to Pick Winners?\n\nThe above writeup clearly suggests that despite adversities associated with the 737 MAX groundings there are quite a few positive for airlines that are likely to brighten their earnings picture in the current reporting cycle.\n\nHowever, given the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right transportation bets with the potential to beat on earnings can be a daunting task.
