Following the explosion, President Donald Trump tweeted a surveillance image depicting the apparent aftermath of the incident and declared that the U.S. had nothing to do with what transpired at the launch site.\n\nWith the latest sanctions, the Trump administration can subject foreign companies and governments, including international space cooperation organizations, to penalties if they have any involvement with the Iranian space agency. They would also freeze any of the agency\u2019s assets in U.S. jurisdictions, though there aren\u2019t likely to be any given the state of relations between the two nations.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the \u201curgency of the threat\u201d was underscored by Iran\u2019s recent attempt to launch a space vehicle. \u201cThe United States will not allow Iran to use its space launch program as cover to advance its ballistic missile programs,\u201d he said in a statement announcing the sanctions.\n\nOfficials said the move was not directly related to last week\u2019s explosion but that the surveillance image provided evidence of the U.S. assertion that the Iranian space program is used to develop missiles, including ones capable of carrying nuclear warheads or other weapons of mass destruction over long distances.\n\nThe sanctions are part of the Trump administration\u2019s escalating campaign of economic and diplomatic measures against Iran since unilaterally withdrawing last year from an international accord that was intended to curb the Iranian nuclear program.\n\nIran insists it is developing rockets to launch satellites into space, which it has done twice since 2013. The explosion marked the third failure involving a rocket at the Iranian center, which has raised suspicions of sabotage in Iran\u2019s space program.\n\nIran government spokesman Ali Rabiei said Monday the explosion was \u201ca technical matter and a technical error.\u201d\n\nCommercially available satellite images by Planet Labs Inc. and Maxar Technologies showed a black plume of smoke rising above a launch pad Thursday, with what appeared to be the charred remains of a rocket and its launch stand. In previous days, satellite images had shown officials there had repainted the launch pad blue.\n\nThe blast followed failed launches of the Payam and Doosti satellites in January and February. A separate fire at the Imam Khomeini Space Center in February also killed three researchers, authorities said at the time.\n\nIran is preparing to launch the Nahid-1, a communication satellite, into space.\n\nThe U.S. alleges such satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on Iran to undertake no activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Trump administration imposed sanctions Tuesday on Iran's space agency for the first time, accusing it of developing ballistic missiles under the cover of a civilian program to launch satellites into orbit.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Matthew Lee"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/29/iran_satellite_06810_c47-0-1278-718_s1770x1032.jpg?a1ccb1c6111430bbd995e1e036cb578c11839875"}
