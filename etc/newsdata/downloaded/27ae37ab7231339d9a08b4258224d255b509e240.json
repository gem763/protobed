Threatening to call the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency as a discriminatory move also will violate the guidelines.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security officially defines \u201calien\u201d as \u201cany person not a citizen or national of the United States.\u201d\n\nNo human being is \u201cillegal.\u201d Calling someone an \u201cillegal\u201d or an \u201cillegal alien\u201d to demean them violates New York City\u2019s protections based on immigration status and national origin.

These include harassing a restaurant patron because of their accent, demanding that store customers speak English or refusing to repair a unit occupied by an immigrant family and threatening to call ICE if they complain.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the issuance of this guidance, which is an important step forward in the fight for respect for immigrants\u2019 humanity and dignity,\u201d Jessie Hahn, a labor and policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement accompanying the commission\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cAt a time when hateful political rhetoric is engendering a climate where private employers and landlords are increasingly discriminating and retaliating against immigrant workers and tenants on the basis of their status, these kinds of enforcement actions are urgently needed,\u201d Hahn said.\n\nAs part of his efforts to target discrimination statewide, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) signed a bill into law in August banning employers from discriminating against job applicants because of their religious attire and facial hair.", "description": "Those using the phrase with a harmful intent could be fined.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d93fb5c2200008c01dc1642.jpeg?cache=zd6lhrhbfw&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
