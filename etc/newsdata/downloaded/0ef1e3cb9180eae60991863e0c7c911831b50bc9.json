Braveboy said in her \u201cstate of justice\u201d speech. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nStanding on the stage of a bright conference hall, Prince George\u2019s County State\u2019s Attorney Aisha N. Braveboy gave a 20-minute speech about the \u201cstate of justice\u201d in the county. Claps and cheers punctuated the address as the county\u2019s top prosecutor talked about convictions won and criminals sentenced. But there was one clear high point when it came to the audience\u2019s reaction.\n\n\u201cI do not believe in the cash bail system,\u201d Braveboy said last week, with the local president of the NAACP, public defenders and justice reform advocates leaping to a standing ovation. \u201cStarting October 1, my office will no longer request cash bail as a condition of release.\u201d\n\nThose presumed innocent who are not a threat or a danger to the community should not be in jail before trial, said Braveboy, who took office in January.\n\nBraveboy\u2019s new policy adds her to a growing list of progressive prosecutors around the country seeking to end cash bail as part of their criminal justice agendas. And the shift also comes a little more than two years after Maryland changed its bail rules to require that judges impose the \u201cleast onerous\u201d release conditions for defendants who are not considered dangerous or a flight risk.\n\nBraveboy\u2019s office said alternatives to cash bail include counseling, mental health evaluations and drug testing in addition to electronic monitoring through pretrial services under the county Department of Corrections.\n\nFor supporters of the move, the wait now is for the specifics on how the plan will play out and how judges respond.\n\n\n\nThe Prince George\u2019s County courthouse. (Bill O'Leary/Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe devil is in the details,\u201d said District Public Defender for Prince George\u2019s County Keith Lotridge, who said he is excited about Braveboy\u2019s move to help eliminate cash bail. \u201cThe state may not ask for cash bond but it's not up to the state. Unless the judges have buy-in and the judges believe there are resources available to secure people returning to court or to ensure there are no safety issues, some judges will have knee-jerk reactions and hold people without bond.\u201d\n\nGroups working to end widespread incarceration found some evidence that in the absence of being able to set cash bail terms, more judges will order defendants held without bond in an abundance of caution. The groups also fear strains on the county\u2019s pretrial resources if there is an increased use of GPS monitoring.\n\nA report by the Color of Change and Progressive Maryland looked at the 11 months after the Maryland Court of Appeals in February 2017 backed an opinion from Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh (D) stating that cash bail is unconstitutional. Frosh said cash bail unfairly keeps poor people in jail for months awaiting trial while others facing similar charges can pay to go free.\n\nThe groups\u2019 report found the 2017 rule change resulted in a drop \u2014 from 61 percent to 50 percent \u2014 of defendants being held on cash bail. Those ordered held without bond rose 14.5 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy to see progress being made around the money-based bail system . . . but we don\u2019t want an implementation of this that leads to more people being held without bond and therefore not being able to be released,\u201d said Larry Stafford, executive director of Progressive Maryland.\n\n[She used to chase down teens to figure out why they skipped school. Now she wants to help them as Pr. George\u2019s top prosecutor.]\n\nStafford also worried that no cash bail could drive an increase in ankle monitoring, which can incur fees for defendants who submit to such services through a private company.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trading the bail industry for another industry,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cThese can be financially onerous conditions too.\u201d\n\nAndrew Cephas, a spokesman for the county Department of Corrections said there are no fees associated with any of the four levels of pretrial monitoring through the county, \u201cas these individuals are under the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nThe costs could come for defendants who opt for private monitoring services and less demanding oversight requirements.\n\nDiego Albornoz, owner of Diego\u2019s Bail Bonds, said that while defendants monitored by the county don\u2019t pay additional fees, they also may have to undergo drug screening, prove they have a landline, visit Upper Marlboro once a week or put up proof of residence. Albornoz said if their release conditions allow, some people are willing to pay the $250 to $500 a month to be privately monitored to avoid the county\u2019s requirements.\n\n[Alexandria prosecutor moves to limit use of cash bail, part of national trend]\n\nHe also said bonds are a method for compelling people to come back to court.\n\n\u201cI understand that people can\u2019t pay because they don\u2019t have money,\u201d Albornoz said. \u201cBut people won\u2019t go to court if you don\u2019t hold them accountable. We [bail bondsmen] made people go to court.\u201d\n\nThe number of defendants who don\u2019t show up for court proceedings appears to have increased since the state changed its rules on cash bail, state court data indicates.\n\nFrom July 2016 to June 2017, the fiscal year before the statewide cash bail rule took effect, about 16 percent of the roughly 19,200 criminal cases filed in Prince George\u2019s District Court reported failures for the defendant to appear in court, according to data from the Maryland judiciary. Failure-to-appear incidents rose to nearly 18 percent of the roughly 18,600 criminal cases filed in the county in the fiscal year after the rule change took effect.\n\nBraveboy said her policy shift won\u2019t end the cash bail system, but \u201cwe hope that the steps that we are taking will signal to other decision-makers that there are alternatives.\u201d\n\nProsecutors will still request no bond for individuals considered to be a danger to the community or to themselves, said Denise Roberts, a spokeswoman for Braveboy.\n\n\u201cFor example, when someone is charged with murder, we routinely ask for no bond because we believe the community would be at risk,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cOftentimes there is no condition of release that would protect the public.\u201d\n\nCephas said as of last week there were 50 defendants on electronic monitoring and 110 defendants on pretrial release with case management. Each of the county\u2019s case managers is not permitted to carry a caseload of more than 50 defendants, he said. The department currently has 16 correctional treatment coordinators doing pretrial work, he said, and can lean on other employees who don\u2019t work in pretrial to take on cases as needed.\n\n\u201cThe Prince George\u2019s County Department of Corrections is prepared to handle a possible influx if there is an increase of defendants being released on pretrial monitoring,\u201d Cephas said in a statement.\n\nScott Roberts, senior director of criminal justice campaigns for Color of Change, echoed Stafford\u2019s fears that more people would be electronically monitored or held in jail without bond. But, Roberts said, he remains \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat gives us hope that Prince George\u2019s County will catch up in the way that it should be as the wealthiest black-majority county in the country,\u201d he said of the criminal justice policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a place that demographically is \u00adtailor-made for these types of reforms, but there\u2019s been a reluctance to take this kind of bold action.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nFrom defendant to top prosecutor, this tattooed Texas DA represents a new wave in criminal justice reform\n\nShe got 12 years for $31 of pot.
