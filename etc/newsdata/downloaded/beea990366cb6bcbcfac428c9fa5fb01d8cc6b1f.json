Our writer straps in for the high-altitude thrill of his life\n\nI am standing on an enormous limestone plateau almost 3km up, peering over the edge of a cliff that seems to plunge all the way to the centre of the Earth. Behind me in the distance are stratified towers of rock, their tips gleaming through wisps of cloud in the morning sun. And in front of me is this breathtaking drop, the gateway to what our guide Alessio calls \u201cthe danger zone\u201d.\n\nAlessio stands on the edge, beckons us nearer, then says: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have fun in here.\u201d And over we go, white-faced and silent, feeling like we\u2019re leaping out of a plane. But instead our boots crunch down onto a concealed ledge that rapidly leads to a heart-pounding procession of cables, rungs and ladders banged into the sheer sides of the rock, all of which have turned this soaring, rippling cliff into one giant vertical adventure park. The white faces soon turn red and sweaty, the silence gives way to gasps and loud exclamations.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 1km drop on Francesco Berti via ferrata\n\nThis descent, the most exhilarating of my life, was a whole new way of experiencing the Dolomites, that magnificent mountain range in northern Italy. We had walked right through this spellbinding landscape the year before, from north to south. But now, instead of heading for the passes, we were tackling the lofty peaks \u2013 an endeavour only made possible by what may well be Italy\u2019s greatest gift to the planet: its extraordinarily numerous and utterly electrifying via ferrata routes.\n\nVia ferrata translates as \u201cthe way of iron\u201d, which is what these climbing aids were made of when they were first fixed to rock faces during the first world war, when Italian and Austrian troops fought ferocious battles on these mountains. Today they\u2019re made of steel \u2013 and superbly maintained. On this spectacular stretch, known as the Francesco Berti, the via ferrata opened up what would otherwise have been a preposterously treacherous descent down, through, under and across smooth slabs, notched ridges, spiky outcrops and tottering ledges that can quickly thin to nothing. The drop was about 1km. The thrill was immeasurable.\n\nVia ferrata works like this: you wear a harness with two leashes, each bearing a sturdy quick-release clip at the end. These you attach to the cable, always keeping at least one latched on. There are no ropes to lug around; no nuts, hexes or other fiddly anchors to fasten to the rock; no elaborate knots to master. If you fall, the cable will catch you before you drop too far, and there\u2019s a built-in shock absorber to stop you snapping in half, just in case.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The edge of the plateau that Andrew and his group went over\n\nAt the start, I was seeking out holds, thinking this would provide a more authentic experience, letting me feel at one with the mountain. But after about 10 minutes, I was completely at one with the cable, gripping it with both fists and even my knees \u2013 particularly when, after one ill-judged stretch, I slowly spun through 180 degrees and found myself facing outwards, feet dangling in thin air, gazing at nothing but blue skies and distant summits. The cable, I realised, is there to be grabbed.\n\nWhen people gasp at your photographs, at those giddying images of you nonchalantly hanging off a pinnacle nosing up into the stratosphere, you have to fight the urge to blurt out: \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that hard!\u201d We\u2019re not even climbers. We\u2019re hillwalkers. And we\u2019re pretty rubbish. The four of us have got lost on every big peak in the Scottish Highlands, and plenty of small ones too.\n\nBut there we were on the Giro del Sorapiss \u2013 a grade three route, according to Cicerone\u2019s guidebook, on a scale that rises to six \u2013 each feeling like Spider-Man as we scaled up, down and along its via ferrata sections. You just get a huge amount of high-altitude bang for your buck: the chance to feel like a real mountaineer while soaking up those stunning views. From isolated peaks to sprawling saw-toothed ranges, everywhere you look there\u2019s yet another cross-hatched, vertical colossus \u2013 all formed of fossilised coral reef thrust up from the seabed 50 million years ago when Italy battered into Europe. Corbusier called the Dolomites the greatest architecture on Earth and we were right in the heart of it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rounding Punta Anna\n\nThe rock formed by this tumult is perfect for climbing, which is one of the reasons why the Dolomites have the world\u2019s highest concentration of via ferrata routes, roughly 170. But there is a downside: the routes are understandably popular, especially in summer when crowds and queues can detract from their wild character. That\u2019s why it was great to make our debut on Sorapiss, a longer, more out-of-the-way route. The epic circuit (or giro) takes two days and includes a lengthy pair of practically sheer via ferratas: the Alfonso Vandelli lifts you up high on the first day; the Francesco Berti spins you back down on the second. \u201cWe won\u2019t see many people today,\u201d said Alessio as we set off. \u201cThis route is wild.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dolomites at dawn \u2026 a morning view of stratified towers on the way to via ferrata Francesco Berti\n\nThe Giro del Sorapiss is also a terrific introduction to the world of refuges, those magical hostels that pepper the trails and are a vital part of any Dolomites trip, allowing you to venture far into the mountains, hiking from hut to splendidly located hut. Some are well-equipped, others more cramped and basic, but all are unfailingly welcoming, right down to the window-boxes spilling over with alpine blooms.\n\nYou may get the odd remote refuge that lacks showers and hot water, but they\u2019ll still manage to bring you mounds of freshly grated parmesan with every hot and hearty meal, and a pair of fancy slippers or Crocs to change into the moment you arrive and wearily pull off your boots.\n\nWe arrived in Venice, drove two hours north into the Dolomites, parked in a layby, then hiked up for an hour or so to stay first at Rifugio Vandelli, one of the more spartan refuges but very friendly. It is here that the Giro del Sorapiss begins, by a turquoise lake ringed by dwarf pine. There was a mood of trepidation in the tavern that night: maps and tips were nervously exchanged, but people kept largely to themselves, quietly playing cards and nipping out to catch the glorious sunset before turning in early.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Idyllic spot \u2026 Rifugio San Marco\n\nThe next night at Rifugio San Marco \u2013 a gorgeous cuckoo clock of a refuge swaddled by mountains \u2013 it was party time. \u201cHow did you get on?\u201d yelled Ed, a 65-year-old New Yorker who was walking the circuit with his son. \u201cDid you get caught in the hail?\u201d As we sank our beers in the garden\u2019s fading light, we told Ed we\u2019d dodged the brief burst of afternoon hail by sheltering under a ledge, but had then got trapped there by a flash flood cascading down the mountainside. Alessio had to rope us together and lead us through the gap behind the torrent, which would have swept away anyone in its path.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d said Ed, eyes popping. He ran off to tell his son before dashing back to add: \u201cHey, have you guys tried the solar-powered showers? They\u2019re outdoor and unisex \u2013 very European! And the water\u2019s warm enough to be pleasant.\u201d\n\nHe was right. Besides the hail, we\u2019d had nothing but searing sun all day. But when my turn came to shower, a snap electrical storm suddenly descended, lighting up the peaks all around me in flash after flash. It might not have been the wisest idea, to stand under water pouring from a metal faucet on a tree-lined mountainside as lightning blazed, but I wouldn\u2019t have missed that shower, or lovely family-run San Marco, for anything.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On via ferrata Alfonso Vandelli, minutes after leaving Rifugio Vandelli\n\nIn the bar later, the refuge\u2019s guitar was passed around and, as an enthusiastic cross-language singsong developed, a group of Italian hikers began doing magic tricks and asking us for Scottish tunes. Platefuls of steaming goulash and bolognese soon followed, rounded off with sublime strudel, grappa by the ladleful, and louder singing.\n\nAlessio had been wary when I first floated the idea of finishing our via ferrata odyssey with a Dolomites classic: the mighty Punta Anna, a hair-raising grade five route right up the face of Tofana di Mezzo, which rises ridiculously steeply to a whopping 3,244 metres. But having been with us on Sorapiss, he relented and, after a short drive and a hike, we found ourselves strolling into Rifugio Pomedes, near the Punta Anna starting point.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Beetroot gnocchi brushed with poppy-seed butter at Rifugio Pomedes\n\nA much larger refuge, Pomedes couldn\u2019t match San Marco for charm, but it did have compensations: en suite rooms; a menu boasting beetroot gnocchi brushed with poppy-seed butter; and a stuffed squirrel doing via ferrata up its foyer walls. \u201cYour face looks familiar,\u201d we overheard one climber say to another out on the terrace. \u201cDidn\u2019t we meet on the Matterhorn?\u201d Clearly, we had entered another level.\n\nIn the morning, the route \u2013 exposed, airy and a good deal more technical \u2013 shot us straight up the cliffside, with big reaches, crazy drops, sketchy footholds, and quite a few heart-stopping sticking points. After the five most adrenaline-fuelled hours of our lives, we reached the top of Punta Anna and broke out the whisky for a celebratory nip in the rarefied air.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest View of Pelmo from Pomedes terrace\n\n\u201cHow do we ever beat this?\u201d we asked Alessio, looking out, or rather down, at the massive mountains all around. After some thought, he reeled off an itinerary that included Coldai, Civetta and \u2013 gleaming pink just to the west \u2013 the staggering Tofana di Rozes, the pearl of the Dolomites, which was once roamed by wild horses. \u201cCan I pay now?\u201d I said.\n\n\u2022 Car hire for the trip was provided by Europcar, which hires economy vehicles from Venice Marco Polo airport from \u20ac18 a day, and compacts from \u20ac25.\n\nHow to do it\n\nGuide and kit\n\nAlessio Nardellotto works for Dolomiti Ski Rock. Prices start at \u20ac250 for a day\u2019s guiding on via ferrata and \u20ac600 for the two-day Giro del Sorapiss. Prices vary with group size and include kit and rescue insurance. If you want your own kit, Snow+Rock\u2019s Edelrid Via Ferrata Cable Kit (\u00a385) is excellent, with instant easy release; pair with its Black Diamond Solution harness (\u00a370). The map we used was Tabacco 03, Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo e Dolomiti Ampezzane (\u00a311.99). The guidebook we used was Cicerone\u2019s Via Ferratas of the Italian Dolomites Vol 1 (\u00a317.95), but don\u2019t do Sorapiss anti-clockwise as it suggests. Go clockwise and you\u2019ll hit the via ferrata in the morning when you\u2019re fresh, it\u2019s cooler, and there\u2019s less chance of bad weather.\n\nAccommodation\n\nDorm beds at Rifugio Vandelli start at \u20ac52, Rifugio San Marco \u20ac53, Rifugio Pomedes \u20ac60 (all half-board).\n\nGetting there\n\nTrain from Verona to Bolzano from \u20ac9. Details of trains to Italy from the UK from the Man in Seat 61. Or fly to Venice from several UK airports.\n\n\n\nLooking for a holiday with a difference?
