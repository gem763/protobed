He was represented by the Belfast-based civil rights organisation the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ).", "description": "Belfast court decides that suspension will not damage peace process", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6cacd2d2df115c38dfdf99d679fb1333b1948c/0_23_1020_612/master/1020.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a6c6fd93fa30bd5cf752d9669dc7783a", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
