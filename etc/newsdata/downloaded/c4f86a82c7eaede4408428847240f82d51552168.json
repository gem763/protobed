In the months since prosecutors announced criminal charges against 51 people, observers have questioned whether any of the defendants would serve time in prison. In June, former Stanford sailing coach John Vandemoer, the first person involved in the scandal to be sentenced, was not sentenced to time in prison.\n\nOne complicating factor has been a legal debate over whether any victim suffered a financial loss as a result of the bribery scheme\u2014which could affect how lenient the sentences are. Federal probation officers, in conflict with prosecutors, concluded in a report this week that there was no victim of Huffman\u2019s crime.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She ultimately decided not to pursue the same scheme for her youngest daughter.\n\nIn a letter to U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani last week, Huffman said there was \u201cno justification for what I have done,\u201d but explained that her \u201cdesperation to be a good mother\u201d drove her to meddle with her daughter\u2019s test score.\n\n\u201cI talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot. I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nThe charges against Huffman and other parents\u2014and anticipation that they might not serve time in prison\u2014have fueled conversations about racial and socioeconomic inequality in the criminal justice system and fairness in higher education, as those accused of bribing their way into elite schools also had access to legal advantages, including private tutors, expensive college counselors and powerful connections.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, prosecutors mentioned the case of Kelley Williams-Bolar, a mother in Akron, Ohio who was convicted in 2011 on felony charges related to registering her daughters for public school under their grandfather\u2019s address in a nearby district. She was sentenced to 10 days in jail, three years of probation, and fined $70,000. Her conviction was later reduced to a misdemeanor by then-Gov. John Kasich.\n\n\u201cI was a divorced mom, a black mom, living in an inner-city, just trying to make my way, trying to go to college, trying to start over again, and the justice system didn\u2019t have any mercy on that at all,\u201d Williams-Bolar told TIME this week. \u201cThe justice system is not just for everyone.\u201d\n\nHuffman\u2019s sentence provides some insight into what other defendants in the admissions scandal can expect as their cases unfold. Talwani noted that Huffman did not involve her child in the scheme and paid a smaller bribe than many parents, given that some paid bribes as high as $6.5 million to secure their child a spot at an elite college.\n\nSeveral defendants\u2014including Full House actor Lori Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli, accused of paying $500,000 to have their daughters designated as crew team recruits at the University of Southern California\u2014have pleaded not guilty and are proceeding to trial.\n\nThey could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted.\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "description": "Actor Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in jail on Friday for her role in the college admissions cheating scandal", "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/felicity-huffman-college-scandal-sentence.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
