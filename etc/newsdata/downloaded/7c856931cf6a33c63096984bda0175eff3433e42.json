Vriet, moenie praat nie. Ek gaan vir jou moer.\" (Eat, that is not my faeces, it's my dog's... Eat, don't talk. I will hit you.)\n\nWilliams had tried to resign but this was rejected as she had to give the department at least one month's notice.\n\nShe could face suspension for bringing the hospital into disrepute as well as disciplinary action if she is reported to the South African Nursing Council.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
