A third or less of workers have an \u201cideal\u201d situation, where they\u2019re consistently working a traditional job with benefits between ages 50 and 62, according to researchers at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Only 26% of workers had a \u201ctraditional job\u201d with health and retirement benefits during the 12-year period the researchers analyzed, said Alicia Munnell, one of the authors of the report.\n\nInstead, many follow a sequence that includes retiring early or bouncing between no work and gig work. \u201cAnd, worse, many have a weak attachment to the labor force or are in nontraditional jobs consistently,\u201d the researchers said. Workers who consistently took nontraditional jobs were less likely to use these gigs as temporary work in between traditional jobs, or as a means to fill the time until retirement.\n\nOnly 26% of workers had a \u2018traditional job\u2019 with health and retirement benefits between the ages of 50 and 62.\n\nWorkers who take nontraditional jobs not only end up with less in retirement income, but could also eventually suffer from depression, the report said.\n\nSee: You\u2019re probably not ready to retire \u2014 psychologically\n\nNontraditional jobs have become a popular way to earn more. A third of workers today are a part of the gig economy, such as freelancing in writing and graphic design or driving for Lyft LYFT, +6.56% and using their skills on TaskRabbit, an Intuit INTU, -3.38% and Emergent Research report found. That type of on-demand gig work is expected to make up 43% of the workforce in 2021.\n\nThe Center for Retirement Research paper defines nontraditional work as one that lacks benefits and either has flexible work hours or includes an individual working with no employees of her own. It also did not find the share of workers in nontraditional jobs to be rising.\n\nGig work doesn\u2019t often lead to a robust retirement account. Many of the companies dedicated to facilitating these on-demand jobs don\u2019t have 401(k) plans as part of their benefits for gig workers (though Uber does offer retirement plans in the form of an individual retirement account to drivers). Many of these workers are using the money earned through these jobs to thwart living paycheck to paycheck, or to pay off debt. If they aren\u2019t offered retirement plans through their work, they would have to search for and open up the next best option, such as an IRA or solo 401(k). IRAs, while beneficial, also have much lower maximum contribution limits than 401(k) plans.\n\nStates are beginning to address these issues for workers. Oregon, California and Illinois have already implemented state-run retirement programs where small businesses are required to provide employees with an alternative to a 401(k) plan (in these cases, IRAs). California and Oregon have also opened their programs to gig workers.\n\nAlso see: The 401(k) retirement is coming \u2014 are you prepared?\n\nMany Americans nearing retirement are financially unprepared. A person\u2019s retirement security can rest on how much he personally saved for the moment, unlike in decades past, when workers could expect a pension from their companies to secure their lifestyle in old age. There isn\u2019t enough data on retirement available, and some experts disagree about how ready (or not) American are for their retirement, but studies and surveys consistently show every few months how unsure individuals are for their future security.\n\nSaving and investing enough for retirement aren\u2019t the only issues Americans face for their futures \u2014 some people may suffer from overconfidence in their nest egg, which is an entirely different, and dangerous, problem. A Federal Reserve report from May found the perception of retirement preparedness increased with age, even among those who had little or no assets earmarked for their futures. About 17% of Americans between 45 and 59 years old had no retirement savings but 42% of them said they were on track, while 13% of those 60 and older said they had no savings but 45% said they felt prepared.", "description": "Taking a nontraditional job late in life will likely hurt your retirement, this study indicates.", "authors": ["Alessandra Malito"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT752_uber_ZG_20191022084500.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
