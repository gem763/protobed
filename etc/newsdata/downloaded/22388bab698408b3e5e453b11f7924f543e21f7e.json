Biden owns a 10 percent stake in BHR.\n\nBiden and his father, Vice President Joe Biden -- who's seeking the Democratic Party's nomination to run against Trump -- have come under scrutiny over the younger man's business dealings in Ukraine. House Democrats are conducting an impeachment inquiry into a whistleblower's claim that the president asked the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden's work there in the hopes of generating ammunition for his 2020 reelection campaign.\n\nTrump responded to the move by saying he has a responsibility as president to address potential corruption, whether it involves the Bidens or anyone else.\n\nBiden attorney George Mesires did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment. Megvii, the firm in which BHR invested, designs image recognition and deep-learning software used to track ethnic minorities in China\u2019s Xinjiang province.\n\nThe U.S. government \"cannot and will not tolerate the brutal suppression of ethnic minorities within China,\u201d said Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. \u201cThis action will ensure that our technologies, fostered in an environment of individual liberty and free enterprise, are not used to repress defenseless minority populations.\u201d\n\nMegvii, which is backed by Chinese tech giant Alibaba, filed in August for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. It\u2019s seeking to raise up to $1 billion in the stock sale, which is expected to occur before the end of the year. It is unclear if Monday\u2019s actions will alter the company\u2019s plans.\n\nEarlier this year, Megvii raised $750 million in a funding round, giving it a valuation of more than $4 billion, according to Reuters. Megvii lost 5.2 billion yuan ($730 million) in the first six months of this year, more than in all of 2018.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nFOX Business' R.N.
