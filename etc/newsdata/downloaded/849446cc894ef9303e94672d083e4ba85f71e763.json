World Tour eco-friendly.\n\n\"We're actually bringing someone from Reverb, this company that basically specializes in the best and most healthy and green ways to do everything,\" she said.\n\n\"So there's no plastic straws allowed, the fans are going to bring their own water bottles, there's going to be recycle cans everywhere, because if something's recyclable, it doesn't matter unless there's a recycle bin.\"\n\nEvery stop on the tour will also include a \"Billie Eilish Eco-Village,\" where fans can learn about climate change and what they can do to make a difference.\n\nEarlier, Eilish teamed up with actor Woody Harrelson to make a point about climate change.\n\n\"Our Earth is warming up and our oceans are rising,\" says Eilish in the video. \"Extreme weather is wrecking millions of lives.\"\n\n\"We cannot let this happen on our watch. Up to one million species are becoming extinct because of man's actions, and time is running out.\"\n\nReleased in March, Eilish's latest album When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and has since become the biggest-selling debut album in a decade.\n\nEilish is the first female artist to have 14 simultaneous chart entries, and her songs have been streamed over 15 billion times.\n\nThe Where Do We Go? World Tour kicks off March 9 in Miami and ends in London July 27. The only Canadian date is April 11 at Rogers Arena in Vancouver.", "description": "'Our Earth is warming up and our oceans are rising,' says Eilish in a video.
