Scheer is due to release his full party platform on Friday.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, median household total income in 2015 was just over C$70,000.\n\nThe debate - the third and last encounter between the leaders before the election - was much more sedate than a bad-tempered English encounter on Monday.\n\nFrench is the language spoken by most people in Quebec, Canada's second most populous province, which accounts for 78 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons.\n\nThe Liberals started the campaign with 40 of those seats and initially targeted another dozen to help make up for expected losses elsewhere.\n\nSurveys show the once moribund separatist Bloc Quebecois, recovering quickly under new leader Yves-Francois Blanchet, could take some of the extra seats Trudeau is counting on.\n\nThis strongly suggests the most likely result is a minority Liberal or Conservative administration that will be reliant on the support of smaller parties to govern. Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than two years.\n\nCommentators generally agree Scheer did poorly in a French-language debate last week but held his own in the English session on Monday.\n\n($1=$1.33 Canadian) (Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, struggling to establish a lead ahead of an Oct. 21 election, on Thursday accused his main rival of planning to cut taxes on the country's richest people.
