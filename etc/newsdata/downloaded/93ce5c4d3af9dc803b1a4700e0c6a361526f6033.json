Sports shows aren\u2019t included.\n\nA decade or so ago, such a statistic would prompt audible wailing from network executive suites. The nature of television has changed so much that it\u2019s too early to tell if viewers are bored with what the offerings or if those numbers reflect that more people are watching on their own time and making their own schedules.\n\nNetworks will have a better idea on how the shows are doing after a month, when delayed and digital viewing is figured in.\n\nOne quick example: Last season NBC\u2019s \u201cThis is Us\u201d averaged 8.3 million viewers on the night an episode first aired, Nielsen said. After 35 days of digital and delayed viewing was added, the typical episode of the show reached 19.9 million. It grew further to 21.7 million viewers after 100 days, meaning a minority of viewers actually watched it live.\n\nProducer Dick Wolf likely isn\u2019t panicking that his dramas \u201cChicago Fire\u201d and \u201cChicago Med\u201d are down 8% in live viewership this season. He isn\u2019t alone.\n\nThe live numbers shouldn\u2019t be ignored, though. The 45% drop in live viewership for Fox\u2019s \u201cEmpire\u201d isn\u2019t likely to improve that much. Similarly, NBC might want to keep an eye on the comedy \u201cThe Good Place\u201d and medical drama \u201cNew Amsterdam,\u201d both of which are down 28%.\n\nSo far this season, the most popular scripted program in live viewing is a dependable one, CBS\u2019 \u201cNCIS,\u201d and it is down only 2% from last year.\n\nCBS won last week in prime time, averaging 6.6 million viewers. NBC was second with 6.4 million, Fox had 6 million, ABC had 4 million, Univision had 1.3 million, ION Television had 1.12 million, Telemundo had 1.06 million and the CW had 1.03 million.\n\nESPN was the week\u2019s most popular cable network, averaging 3.03 million viewers in prime time. Fox News Channel had 2.72 million, TBS had 2.22 million, MSNBC had 2 million and TLC had 1.25 million.\n\nABC\u2019s \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d topped the evening newscasts with an average of 8.1 million viewers. NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d was second with 7.4 million and the \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d had 5.1 million viewers.\n\nFor the week of Oct. 7-13, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: NFL Football: N.Y. Giants at New England, Fox, 16.26 million; NFL Football: Pittsburgh at L.A. Chargers, NBC, 14.89 million; \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d CBS, 12.41 million; NFL Football: Cleveland at San Francisco, ESPN, 11.56 million; \u201cSunday Night Pre-Kick,\u201d NBC, 11.54 million; \u201cNCIS,\u201d CBS, 11.21 million; \u201cFootball Night in America, Part 3,\u201d NBC, 9.73 million; \u201cThursday Night Pre-Kick,\u201d Fox, 9.34 million; \u201cFBI,\u201d CBS, 8.7 million; \u201cThe Voice\u201d (Tuesday), NBC, 8.55 million.\n\n___\n\nABC is owned by The Walt Disney Co.
