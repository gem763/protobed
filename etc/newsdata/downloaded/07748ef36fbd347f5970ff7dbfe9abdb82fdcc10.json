It was 1979, in the middle of the Studio 54 era, when she moved to New York. She was 21 years old, had just been signed by the Elite model agency and appeared to have the world at her feet. But she soon wanted to go back to her home town. \u201cThere was a lot of cocaine around,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a small experience at the very beginning and hated it. I hated it! It was only, like, a month. I really didn\u2019t like the way it felt. It didn\u2019t make me feel good and I couldn\u2019t sleep. I actually went into my agency and said I wanted to go home, and they said: \u2018You need new friends. You\u2019re around the wrong people.\u2019\u201d\n\nWho was she hanging out with? \u201cI don\u2019t even remember, honestly,\u201d she says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t around famous people at that point. It was not what I intended to do.\u201d John Casablancas, the founder of Elite, flew with her to Paris, \u201cand this young man showed up at the agency who didn\u2019t drink, smoke or do drugs, and it was like, I had a boyfriend.\u201d\n\nThe young man was Olivier Chandon de Brailles, the heir to Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they prearranged the whole thing, but it sure did work out well for me. I started working non-stop and my whole life opened up. I was about to go home for a few seconds there.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anybody that story so please don\u2019t make it sound like I was a big druggy because I really wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI meet MacDowell at her house, a secluded Spanish-style property that is modest by Hollywood Hills standards and homely, with a \u201cHello\u201d doormat. A tiny rescue dog called Ava Gardner is sunning herself on the terrace. Next door is a building site, which MacDowell apologises for. A house is being built, she says, for her daughters, Margaret, 24, and Rainey Qualley, 29, who have followed her into the movie business.\n\nMargaret is the breakout star of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, playing one of Charles Manson\u2019s followers. The day before I meet her mother, she has been nominated for an Emmy for her supporting role in the TV show Fosse/Verdon. MacDowell was in her car when she heard the news. \u201cI was having a hard time driving, I was so excited,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where I\u2019m going, but I\u2019m crying; I was really having to focus.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest MacDowell with Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.

There were more nominations for the romcoms Green Card (in 1991) and Four Weddings and a Funeral (in 1995), and she had success, too, with the 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. Now 61, MacDowell has continued to work consistently, while spending much of the past 20 years bringing up her daughters and their older brother, Justin, in North Carolina, after divorcing their father, Paul Qualley, in 1999.\n\nShe grew up in Gaffney, South Carolina, not too far from where she raised her own kids, and her deep resistance to drugs and alcohol can be attributed to her upbringing. Her mother was an alcoholic and the role of carer fell to MacDowell, the youngest of four siblings. She and her mother, \u201chad a great relationship and I always felt loved,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was this old-fashioned can opener attached to the wall and she\u2019d be in the kitchen drinking and I\u2019d clean the oil off the can opener and talk to her and ask: \u2018Why do you drink?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen she was 10, she would get up in the middle of the night to check that her mother\u2019s cigarettes were stubbed out properly. \u201cThere were burn marks all over the floor and on the couch; it\u2019s amazing we didn\u2019t burn down,\u201d she says. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility for a child, I say. \u201cI think I\u2019ve felt responsible all my life. But I\u2019m good at it. I\u2019ve been in training for a long time.\u201d\n\nAt 16, she was working in McDonald\u2019s alongside her mother, a former music teacher, and watched her get fired for turning up drunk. At 17, she involved doctors to try to help her mother overcome her alcoholism, which failed when one of them gave her mother Valium. \u201cThat was a bad decision because then I couldn\u2019t communicate with her. And I communicated really well with her. We could have committed her; we just didn\u2019t have the guts. The doctor told us she would die in five years. The strange thing is, she did.\u201d\n\nMacDowell was living in Paris when her mother died of a heart attack, and clings to a letter she received from her. \u201cShe said she had quit drinking and that she was so proud of me,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the last year of her life and I didn\u2019t really get to be around it, which was super sad. I think about going back to Gaffney. I\u2019d like to go back and try to find out from other people what that year that I didn\u2019t get to experience was like.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest MacDowell with Hugh Grant in Four Weddings and a Funeral. Photograph: Polygram/Working Title/Kobal/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nShe is a big advocate of therapy, which helps, although she is not having any currently. \u201cI feel like everything is going really well for me right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThe last therapist I had \u2013 I felt like I\u2019d done so much therapy \u2013 I was like: \u2018She\u2019s already diagnosing me and we\u2019ve only had two conversations.\u2019 You have to listen a little longer before you start telling me what\u2019s wrong!\u201d\n\nHer latest role, in the comedy-horror Ready or Not, is fun; she plays the glamorous matriarch of a rich, ridiculous family who embark on a deadly game of hide and seek to \u201cinitiate\u201d their son\u2019s new wife into the firm.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really know what I was getting into,\u201d she shrugs. Yet, with generally positive reviews and a supposedly handsome box-office return, it looks set to become one of the year\u2019s unexpected success stories in the horror genre. It is directed by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett. She says she liked the fact that \u201cthey were young guys and they\u2019re weird; their energy was different from anything I\u2019ve ever experienced.\n\n\u201cI thought it was really smart and original, but scary and gory as well,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s some classic horror movie stuff, but then all these great lines.\u201d\n\nMacDowell adopted a big fake glossy ponytail to make her character, Becky Le Domas, \u201clook a bit crazier and more powerful\u201d. It is reminiscent of the eccentric Aunt Ivy she played in the latest series of the bizarre British sitcom Cuckoo, earlier this year.\n\nWhile the roles she has played most recently are entertaining \u2013 and show off her sense of humour \u2013 they do not showcase the full range of her talent. By comparison, her depiction of a grieving widow in 2017\u2019s Love After Love was so raw that critics compared it to her Sex, Lies and Videotape breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you watched it,\u201d she replies. \u201cNot as many people have seen it as I would have liked.\u201d\n\nShe is baffled by this. \u201cIs it my fault it\u2019s not a huge hit? I still did great work, you know. You\u2019re probably seeing better work in that than in Four Weddings. But it\u2019s not a hit, so \u2026 therein is the problem, because everyone is looking for a hit. If you don\u2019t have hits, you don\u2019t resonate as well within the business. Interestingly, very few people have blockbusters. But once you\u2019ve had blockbusters, you\u2019re expected to have blockbusters.\u201d\n\nWhen Love After Love was released, MacDowell described herself as \u201cstarving\u201d for the role. \u201cThere was just a lack of interesting characters,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard every woman say it, because it\u2019s the truth. We\u2019re a very youth-oriented culture. In most movies, the leads are in their 30s and a great leading role for a mature woman is hard to come by. I have felt lulls. Since I was 40, I have felt particular lulls! I\u2019ve been struggling since I was 40.\u201d\n\nThat was the year people started asking her how it felt to have reached an age where she would never work again. \u201cEveryone said everything was going to change at 40 \u2013 and it was true,\u201d she says. \u201cI did some shitty movies that I\u2019ve never even seen!\u201d She cites Town & Country (2001), one of the biggest box office flops in Hollywood history, as an example.\n\nHow did she cope with no longer having her pick of roles? \u201cI kept trying to be positive. I didn\u2019t want to be a whiner because I knew that men were in control and I didn\u2019t want it to be harder than it already was. I knew if you spoke out and whined, they hated you. So I just tried to project this positive attitude. Even in the back of my mind, I\u2019m still trying to please them, because they\u2019re in control.\u201d\n\nThe month before we met, she heard a male actor (\u201cI\u2019m not going to say who\u201d) say: \u201cPeople go to movies to see men, not women.\u201d Did she challenge him? \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like I was going to change him,\u201d she sighs. \u201cThere are a lot of people [in Hollywood] that still push that way of thinking. That is what they think. They\u2019re going to continue to think it. They\u2019re going to continue to push it. Even if a story is about a woman, they\u2019ll cast the male lead first because they believe people do not care about seeing women. Even women, they\u2019ll say that women and men go to the movies to see men.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest MacDowell as the eccentric Aunt Ivy in the British sitcom Cuckoo. Photograph: BBC/Rough Cut\n\n\u201cIt sucks the air out of you. It hurts, not just for me, but for every woman, that this is our position still.\u201d She is heartened by the Time\u2019s Up movement, and the attitudes she sees in women her daughters\u2019 age. \u201cThe younger generation are not like my generation. We were well trained to be \u2018less than\u2019. We had a certain acceptance of our position that the younger generation is not going to tolerate; the wherewithal to teach them they deserve better and they\u2019re not gonna settle for less. I know my kids won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nI ask if she had any reservations about her daughters getting into the movie business, knowing from her own experience what lay ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s funny; everyone says that like there\u2019s some fear of being in this business, but it\u2019s actually a really good business. I just didn\u2019t want them to do it as children. Rainey was asking me at 14. I was like: \u2018At 18, if you want to, you can.\u2019\n\n\u201cLife can be crazy in any profession. When there\u2019s a lot of money, there\u2019s more opportunity to be crazy, but that\u2019s not my lifestyle and it\u2019s not their lifestyle either. We\u2019re really kind of boring people. We barely want to go out ... I\u2019m a home body and I do yoga and I hike, that\u2019s kind of it. No drugs and rock and roll!\u201d\n\nShe moved to California to be near her daughters in 2017, and says she had no idea how much she would enjoy it. For all the struggles women in Hollywood have when they pass 40, she is clearly realistic and healthy, appropriately optimistic. \u201cEveryone has their own journey,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe something fabulous is going to happen for me at 70.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ready or Not is in UK cinemas from 25 September", "description": "She learned responsibility young, caring for her mother \u2013 then became a stunningly successful model and screen star.
