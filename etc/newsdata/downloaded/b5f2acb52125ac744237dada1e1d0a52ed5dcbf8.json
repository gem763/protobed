Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), a ranking member on that committee, tweeted findings in a lengthy thread on Friday.\n\n\u201cThe NRA lied about the December 2015 Moscow trip not being an official trip,\u201d Wyden tweeted. \u201cNRA leaders were told the trip was needed to prove Torshin\u2019s American connections to the Kremlin, and that building relationships with Russians was \u2018NRA business.\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliam A. Brewer III, counsel to the NRA, provided the following statement: \u201cThis report promotes a politically motivated and contrived narrative. An avalanche of proof confirms that the NRA, as an organization, was never involved in the activities about which the Democrats write. This report goes to great lengths to try to involve the NRA in activities of private individuals and create the false impression that the NRA did not act appropriately. Nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) noted to Yahoo Finance that the \u201cCommittee\u2019s Republicans have their own report, based on reviewing the same material.\u201d\n\nMaria Butina walks with Alexander Torshin then a member of the Russian upper house of parliament in Moscow, Russia.

According to prosecutors, she was led by Torshin, who was Russia\u2019s deputy central-bank governor at the time.\n\n\u201cWhile in Moscow, the NRA delegation met with a host of senior level Kremlin officials, including some of Putin\u2019s closest advisors (at least two of whom had been sanctioned by the U.S. government), and multiple Russian oligarchs close to Putin,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThe now-convicted Russian agent Maria Butina made clear to the NRA she wanted to bring the \u2018head of the most powerful political organization in America\u2019 to Russia.\u201d\n\nTo persuade then-incoming NRA president Pete Brownell to agree to participate in the Moscow trip, Butina offered to explore business deals with Russian weapons manufacturers \u201con the condition that he bring the NRA to Russia.\u201d After news of the trip surfaced earlier this year, the NRA released a statement that its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, had been opposed to the trip, and that the trip\u2019s expenses had been repaid.\n\n\u201cPete Brownell was a last minute addition to the NRA trip to Russia after then-NRA President Alan Cors announced he could not attend due to health concerns,\u201d Ryan Repp, a spokesman for Brownell, told Yahoo Finance in an email statement. \u201cHe sought out and obtained compliance guidance, including checking with the government, and followed that guidance before, during and after the trip. He went to support the NRA as the incoming President, and would not have gone if it was not an NRA trip. Pete received absolutely no business for his company as a result of this trip. He has fully cooperated with all inquiries into this matter and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nWyden highlighted an email apparently showing that Brownell was offered a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe was even offered a meeting with Vladimir Putin. pic.twitter.com/TVCZa7BDui \u2014 Ron Wyden (@RonWyden) September 27, 2019\n\n\u201cAfter returning from Moscow, the NRA gave the Russians free rein over the guest list for its 2016 Annual Meeting,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cIt also provided access to other political organizations in 2015 and 2016 like the National Prayer Breakfast and the secretive right-wing Council for National Policy.\u201d", "description": "NRA leaders were told the trip was needed to prove Torshin\u2019s American connections to the Kremlin, and that building relationships with Russians was \u2018NRA business.\u2019\u201d", "authors": ["Adriana Belmonte", "Associate Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jdBXVrMUxeOCkiJr3Avmaw--~B/aD0yNDYzO3c9Mjk5MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/ecffad90-03af-11e9-ae77-17530f119c27", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
