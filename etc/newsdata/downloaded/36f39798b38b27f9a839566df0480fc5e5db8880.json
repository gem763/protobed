At peak strength, Dorian reached Category 5 status, the most severe designation.\n\nJeff Masters, who's been a meteorologist for almost 40 years, wonders whether the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale accurately conveyed the destruction Dorian was capable of inflicting. Masters, who has kept a close eye on the evolution of natural disasters throughout his career, argues that the scale could be doing more harm than good as storms become more frequent and severe.\n\n\"[There's been] a really noticeable upsurge in these sort of catastrophic, almost Category 6 storms,\" he told Day 6 host Brent Bambury.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\"A low-end Category 5 with 160 mile-an-hour winds has 60 per cent less destructive power than Dorian had \u2026 So yeah, it might be good to include an extra notch on the scale to show that 'Hey, these sorts of extreme storms are going to do a lot more damage.'\"\n\nWhat exactly does the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale measure? Is it enough?\n\nHurricane damage is caused by three forces: storm surge, heavy rains and extreme wind. The Saffir-Simpson scale measures sustained wind speed and potential property damage.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Centre , a Category 1 hurricane would have sustained winds of at least 119 km/h. A Category 3, beginning at 178 km/h, is the point at which the storm is considered \"major\" and the damage is estimated to be devastating to catastrophic.\n\n\"You really need to have three separate scales, or maybe you need to have a colour-coded danger scale for all of these factors taken together,\" Masters argued, citing the fatal impact of hurricane flooding in storms that don't surpass the first or second category.\n\nA man smokes a cigarette while watching flood waters caused by Hurricane Sandy from his driveway on October 30, 2012 in New York City.

And people weren't taking it seriously.\"\n\nShould we introduce a wider scale to account for the changing nature of storms?\n\nMasters said he isn't satisfied with the system in place when it comes to educating the public about a hurricane's potential danger.\n\n\"We can do better. We've seen a lot of cases where people don't act on the messages we give them,\" he said.\n\n\"In Europe they use scales where they talk about yellow alert, orange alert and red alert. And they very rarely use the red alert. So something like that might work.\"\n\nMeteorologist Jeff Masters explains the scope of a hypothetical \"Category 6\" hurricane. 0:49\n\nWhere are these \"mega hurricanes\" coming from?\n\nOcean temperatures have been rising at an accelerated, record-breaking rate, and the energy that drives hurricanes is drawn from the warmth of the water, Masters said. Warming waters have been met with faster winds, which cause more extreme damage, he continued.\n\n\"We can anticipate as the decades come, we're going to see a sharp increase in these sort of mega-hurricanes projecting out into this century.\"\n\nTo hear the full interview with Jeff Masters, download our podcast or click 'Listen' above.", "description": "At peak strength, Hurricane Dorian blew past the threshold for Category 5 status.
