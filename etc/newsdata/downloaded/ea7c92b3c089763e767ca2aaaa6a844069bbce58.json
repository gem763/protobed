An SDF media official said he could not confirm these deployments.\n\nAin Issa commands the northern approaches to Raqqa, former capital of the Islamic State \u201ccaliphate\u201d, which Kurdish fighters recaptured from the militants two years ago in one of the biggest victories of a U.S.-led campaign.\n\nMuch of the M4 lies on the southern edge of territory where Turkey aims to set up a \u201csafe zone\u201d inside Syria. Turkey said it had seized part of the highway. An official of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said clashes were ongoing.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this photo taken from the Turkish side of the border between Turkey and Syria, in Akcakale, Sanliurfa province, southeastern Turkey, smoke billows from fires caused by Turkish bombardment in Tal Abyad, Syria, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2019.

Washington announced on Sunday it was abruptly pulling out its entire force of 1,000 troops which had fought alongside Syrian Kurds against Islamic State since 2014.\n\nA U.S. official said on Monday a diplomatic team working to help stabilise territory captured from Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed caliphate had already been pulled out.\n\nU.S. troops were still on the ground but early phases of their withdrawal had started, the official said.\n\nTwo other U.S. officials have told Reuters the bulk of the U.S. pullout could be completed within days.\n\nSunday\u2019s announcement of the U.S. retreat came just a week after Trump said he would shift a small number of troops out of the way, allowing Turkey to attack the Kurds in what they described as a stab in the back.\n\nThousands of Kurdish fighters and their allies have died fighting Islamic State in a close partnership with the United States, a strategy the Trump administration had continued after inheriting it from his predecessor Barack Obama.\n\nTrump says he aims to extract the United States from \u201cendless\u201d wars in the Middle East, in keeping with his view that Washington cannot be the world\u2019s policeman.\n\nHis policy reversal allowed Turkey to launch a cross-border assault last week that sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing and the Kurds scrambling to find new friends.\n\n\u201cAfter the Americans abandoned the region and gave the green light for the Turkish attack, we were forced to explore another option, which is talks with Damascus and Moscow to find a way out and thwart these Turkish attacks,\u201d senior Kurdish official Badran Jia Kurd said.\n\nJia Kurd described the arrangement with Assad\u2019s forces as a \u201cpreliminary military agreement\u201d, and said political aspects would be discussed later. The Kurds have led an autonomous administration in the area they controlled.\n\nAssad aims to restore his government\u2019s authority across all of Syria after more than eight years of civil war.\n\nAnother senior Kurdish politician, Aldar Xelil, described the pact with Damascus as \u201can emergency measure\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe priority now is protecting the border\u2019s security from the Turkish danger,\u201d Xelil said. \u201cWe are in contact with the Damascus government to reach common (ground) in the future.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Syrians bury Syrian Democratic Forces fighters killed fighting Turkish advance in the Syrian town of Qamishli, Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019.

Hours later, the Kurdish-led administration said it had made such a deal for the Syrian army to deploy.\n\nTurkey says it aims to form a \u201csafe zone\u201d in Syria to settle many of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it is hosting.\n\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the operation would extend from Kobani in the west to Hasaka in the east, and go some 30 km (20 miles) into Syrian territory, with the town of Ras al Ain now in Turkish control.\n\nTurkey\u2019s European allies have criticised the incursion, warning of potential sanctions. Erdogan says that Turkey will \u201copen the gates\u201d to Europe for Syrian refugees if the European Union does not back the offensive.\n\nTurkish armed forces continued sporadic cross-border bombardment overnight, residents on the Turkish side said. A Reuters cameraman in the town of Suruc reported occasional howitzer fire.\n\nThe fighting has raised Western concerns that the Kurds, holding large swathes of northern Syria previously controlled by Islamic State, would be unable to keep thousands of jihadists in jail and tens of thousands of their family members in camps.\n\nThe region\u2019s Kurdish-led administration said 785 Islamic State-affiliated foreigners escaped a camp at Ain Issa over the weekend. The British-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, citing sources in the camp, said around 100 people had escaped.\n\nErdogan dismissed the reports and told the state-run Anadolu news agency that accounts of escapes by Islamic State prisoners were \u201cdisinformation\u201d aimed at provoking the West.\n\n(Writing by Tuvan Gumrukcu, Dominic Evans and Peter Graff; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "The Syrian government began deploying on Monday in a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad and his principal ally Russia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da46528210000b908acd8a4.jpeg?cache=6ehxqgai4q&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
