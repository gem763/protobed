Claiming that it is the media\u2019s fault for setting up \u201cterrible incentives\u201d for people to make \u201cextreme and mindless statements\u201d to get on TV, Carlson then held up Schiff as a \u201cprime example.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe recently went into a kind of trance and delivered his own prophetic version of what he believed must have happened between President Trump and the president of Ukraine,\u201d Carlson stated, playing a clip of Schiff delivering a parody version of the call at Thursday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cKeep in mind, that isn\u2019t some guy babbling in the men\u2019s room at Starbucks, that is the man who chairs the mighty House Intelligence Committee,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe trust him with the most sensitive information and yet he is clearly, demonstrably mentally ill,\u201d Carlson added.\n\nThe Fox News host didn\u2019t qualify his diagnosis of the Democratic congressman other than to suggest that it was insane to want the president impeached for pushing the Ukrainian president to look into his political rival.\n\nCarlson\u2019s latest inflammatory remarks are just the latest controversy for the conservative Fox News star. This week has seen him get into an on-air spat with his fellow colleagues Shep Smith and Judge Andrew Napolitano after one of his guests called Napolitano a \u201cfool,\u201d an insult that went unchallenged by Carlson. It also has been less than two months since the primetime host sparked outrage for saying white supremacy is a \u201choax\u201d just three days after the El Paso shooting.\n\nThe Fox host\u2019s comments also come on the heels of the backlash caused by Fox News guest Michael Knowles calling 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg a \u201cmentally ill Swedish child,\u201d prompting the network to issue a quick apology and state that they have no plans to book Knowles in the future.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
