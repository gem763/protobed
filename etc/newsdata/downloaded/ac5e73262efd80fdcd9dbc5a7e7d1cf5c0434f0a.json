Despite being down to 14 men for 50 minutes, Ireland went on to win 45-7 and finished second in the group behind Japan.\n\nThat sent Ireland into the toughest of the quarterfinals possible, against the defending champion New Zealand All Blacks at Tokyo Stadium. If Ireland is knocked out before the World Cup final, the balance of Aki\u2019s sanction will be transferred to his club.\n\nIreland head coach Joe Schmidt said before the ban that he\u2019d be ready to prepare a lineup missing the strong-running midfielder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all split-second stuff. But once it\u2019s a red card you sense a loss of control over what happens next, no matter what you present,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI certainly feel for Bundee, he\u2019s pretty devastated that any further participation is potentially at risk.\u201d\n\nFlyhalf Jonny Sexton on Monday said Ireland was positive about overcoming some setbacks in the group stage, including the upset 19-12 loss to Japan. At the World Cups in 2011 and 2015, Ireland was dominant in the group stage but then lost quarterfinals to Wales and Argentina. Despite a knockout game against New Zealand, which has won the last two titles and is a three-time champion overall, Sexton is confident the Irish can reach the semifinals for the first time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been some negativity around us and we\u2019d feel that\u2019s been pretty strange,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re really confident in how we\u2019re building. I\u2019m hoping that having lost a pool game that we\u2019ve got that (bad) quarterfinal performance out of our system that we\u2019ve had in other tournaments.\n\n\u201cThe difference now is we\u2019re not favorites going into this quarterfinal whereas we were in the last two. So we\u2019re building nicely, we haven\u2019t hit our best performance yet and we need to get close to that to get the right result on Saturday.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ireland center Bundee Aki will miss the rest of Ireland's Rugby World Cup campaign after failing to have his red card overturned for a high tackle in the Pool A game against Samoa last weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/14/aptopix_japan_rugby_wcup_ireland_samoa_11751_c0-534-1597-1465_s1200x700.jpg?29c2463112dbb0449989cc7e4ece4f14ad02cebb", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
