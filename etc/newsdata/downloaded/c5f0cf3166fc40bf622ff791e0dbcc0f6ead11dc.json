But it seems Trisha Goddard has been having a nightmare so far\n\nUploading a video to the photo, Trisha was visibly upset and fighting back tears as she detailed the stress she had been put under.\n\nThe former chat show host posted a caption: 'Apologies!!! This post should be about being excited to meet my @dancingonice #iceskating pro later today, but..... Ugh! My back! Agony!\n\n'Not much sleep for 2nd night after my flight from #nyc Result? I\u2019m feeling really low to think of the dramas I\u2019ve been through to finally find (*last-minute!) accommodation and end up with a bed with a mattress-from-hell for the next freakin\u2019 six weeks training here in the UK!\n\n'Watch out! You can book and pay for accommodation on a website, only to discover that the place advertised as being available for the dates you need, actually isn\u2019t!\n\nStressed out: Having had to relocate from her home in America to take part in the show in London, Trisha, 61, took to Instagram to document her drama - which saw her turn up to the accommodation she had paid to rent in the capital only to learn it's not available\n\nIn training: Trisha was pictured last week at a rink in New York, starting her training before heading to the UK\n\nComplaints: Trisha expressed her disgruntlement on Instagram\n\n'Cue nightmare scenarios of wrangling refunds, and trying to find somewhere else, without repeating the cycle...' [sic]\n\nIn the video, she was seen sat at the edge of the aforementioned bed, struggling to motivate herself to get up.\n\nShe said: 'Isn\u2019t it weird how something like a really bad bed can just change your mood.\n\n'So sorry producers if you wanted a happy \"yay I'm meeting my professional\", I can hardly stand up or walk for the backache so... ugh! Really ugh! Really ugh!'\n\nA happier note: She was next seen out for a run in the autumn sunshine, posting - 'Recipe for lifting mood after night on #nightmare #mattress in rented apartment: '1) Take a #painkiller for resulting #backpain 2) Go for #gentlejog in #sunshine\n\nShe said: 'Isn\u2019t it weird how something like a really bad bed can just change your mood. So sorry producers if you wanted a happy \"yay I'm meeting my professional\", I can hardly stand up or walk for the backache so... ugh! Really ugh! Really ugh!'\n\nTrisha likened the mattress to a marshmallow and moaned that her foam pillows were too fat in a previous post.\n\nShe also apologised to Steps star Ian 'H' Watkins after initially ridiculing him for carrying his own pillows wherever he went.\n\nAfter fellow contestant Caprice Bourret offered Trisha the chance to stay at her place instead - and Instagram followers suggested she invest in a mattress topper from Argos or John Lewis - Trisha was contacted by the owner of the accommodation.\n\nShe told fans: 'It\u2019s ok. The owner has got in contact and is onto it.
