Anthony played poorly for the Thunder then even worse for the Rockets. He\u2019s now 35. Occasionally, washed-up players still land on NBA rosters, but they usually don\u2019t. It\u2019s not worth fretting over the common outcome happening.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe question that really intrigues me about the latter stages of Anthony\u2019s career:\n\nHow did Houston go from giving Anthony a major role to deciding he suddenly couldn\u2019t be with the team at all?\n\nBaxter Holmes of ESPN:\n\nStill, the Rockets know they can\u2019t just take him out of the rotation; doing so would cause a media firestorm. \u201cBecause his name was Carmelo, we treated it differently,\u201d one team source says.\n\nThe Rockets hope that parting ways with Anthony quickly might allow him to join another team.\n\nThis is a strange explanation.\n\nWhat made a \u201cmedia firestorm\u201d so inevitable? Even if it were inevitable, what made a \u201cmedia firestorm\u201d so difficult to deal with? The Rockets couldn\u2019t handle a few questions about Anthony?\n\nIf Anthony protested about a reduced role, that would\u2019ve been one thing. But by all accounts, he did what Houston asked of him while there. He didn\u2019t even get a chance to show whether he could\u2019ve helped as a non-rotation player.\n\nThe Rockets gave him 20-39 minutes in each of his games with them. If he deserved that much playing time, he couldn\u2019t have helped at all in situational spot minutes? Maybe Anthony\u2019s awful defense would have been at least tolerable if he could\u2019ve conserved his energy for smaller bursts on the court.\n\nIf Houston tried to do him a favor, it failed. Anthony never landed with another team. His abrupt and confusing end with the Rockets certainly didn\u2019t instill confidence around the league.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnthony has expressed resentment for how Houston exiled him. He deserves some blame for the predicament. His prior objections about coming off the bench in Oklahoma City contributed to everyone being on pins and needles about his role.\n\nBut it remains strange the Rockets handled the situation in such an extreme manner.", "description": "What made a \"media firestorm\" so inevitable?
