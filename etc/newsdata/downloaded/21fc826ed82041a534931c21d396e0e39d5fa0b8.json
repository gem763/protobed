What do you remember? The Avengers smashes box-office records. Barack Obama battles Mitt Romney to retain control of the Oval Office. Taylor Swift releases Red. Scientists announce the discovery of the Higgs boson. Kim Jong-un becomes the Supreme Leader of North Korea. The Spice Girls reunite at the London Olympics. More than 1,000 people tweet the phrase \u201cpooping bottles.\u201d Macklemore releases \u201cThrift Shop.\u201d Argo. Hurricane Sandy. Elizabeth Warren is elected to the Senate. Lebron James wins his first NBA championship with the Miami Heat. The New York Giants win the Super Bowl. You feel the youngest you\u2019ll ever be and the oldest you\u2019ve ever been. Opportunity is in front of you; all you must do is reach out \u2014 and grab it. On Twitter, so many people write the phrase \u201cpooping bottles\u201d and it is honestly so funny.\n\nTo me, \u201cpooping bottles\u201d remains in the upper tier of infamous internet typos, alongside \u201cHODL,\u201d \u201cbabby,\u201d \u201cbone apple tea,\u201d \u201chamberders,\u201d and \u201cthe smell of my bf\u2019s colon \ud83d\ude0d.\u201d What was nice about \u201cpooping bottles\u201d is that for a time, you could search Twitter and come up with dozens of instances, people defecating when they should be celebrating. It was funny. And then: It stopped. It seems like hardly anyone poops bottles anymore. What happened?\n\nIf you plug the phrase \u201cpopping bottles\u201d into Google Trends, the company\u2019s tool for viewing the relative popularity of search queries over time, you\u2019ll see two spikes. One occurs at the end of 2007, and the second occurs at the end of 2010. This was when bottle-popping fever took over the country. The 2007 spike, it seems, was related to the release of \u201cPop Bottles,\u201d the lead single off Birdman\u2019s album, 5 * Stunna, which featured Lil Wayne (\u201cOkay we popping champagne like we won the championship game\u201d). In late November 2010, Far East Movement\u2019s \u201cLike a G6\u201d peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was next to impossible to turn on Top 40 radio without hearing \u201cPopping bottles in the ice / Like a blizzard.\u201d In early December, T.I. released his song \u201cPopping Bottles,\u201d featuring Drake.\n\nTo find out where \u201cpooping bottles\u201d went, I scraped all 3,470 tweets that contained the phrase \u201cpooping bottles\u201d (I compiled this data in mid-July 2019, so stats for 2019 are partial) and built a spreadsheet of relevant metadata, including time stamps of when they were posted to Twitter. The oldest remaining tweet containing the phrase came just after midnight on April 19, 2009. \u201celement right now pooping bottles, lil hood fro Ray J in the building,\u201d @KP_52 writes.\n\nelement right now pooping bottles, lil hood fro Ray J in the building \u2014 K.P (@KP_52) April 19, 2009\n\nHere are some \u201cpooping bottles\u201d tweets with the most engagement.\n\nPoopin bottles in the club that's what winners do \u2014 MackenzieMerritt (@MackenzieXO_) February 14, 2012\n\nLebron's a trader.

That\u2019s more than double the number from 2011, while 2013 saw a nearly 25 percent drop-off in pooping bottle tweets.\n\nIf you break the trend down even more granularly, by month, you\u2019ll find that \u201cpooping bottles\u201d peaked at the end of 2012. Its most popular months were November (117 mentions) and December (119), when roughly four times a day, someone was pooping bottles. Tweets from the beginning portion of this peak sometimes mention Barack Obama, who was presumably pooping bottles to celebrate his reelection.\n\n#obama congrats now we gonna be pooping bottles. \u2014 WhoSawm3\u2122 (@_K33P_IT_G) November 7, 2012\n\nFrom that peak in 2012, \u201cpooping bottles\u201d appears less and less frequently. In December 2013 and 2015, the phrase spikes again, particularly in the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve when the Champagne flows freely. There\u2019s also a small spike in July of 2014, when BuzzFeed covered the typo and a bunch of bots repeated the headline.\n\nWhile examining obvious concentration of \u201cpooping bottles\u201d tweets around 2012, I discovered that the tweets were spread pretty evenly across the week and around the clock. I isolated November and December 2012, the months that represented peak bottle-pooping, and found that the typo occurs pretty regularly around the clock, with a slight dip between 4 a.m. and noon (ET). In fact, in late 2012, \u201cpooping bottles\u201d tweets occurred twice as frequently between midnight and 4 a.m., than between 4 and 8 in the morning. Surprisingly, in this peak period, the day of the week featuring the most typos was Monday, rather than weekend nights. The least popular days for pooping bottles were Tuesday and Sunday, understandable given that those are down days.\n\nClearer trends become apparent as we zoom out and examine the entire data set. \u201cPooping bottles\u201d tweets are a little more likely to occur on a Friday or Saturday \u2014 34.8 percent of typos occurred on these two days. Meanwhile, the full data set shows that pooping bottle tweets across the date range were more likely to occur, understandably, between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m. (ET) \u2014 a 44.7 percent chance. These are, understandably, the hours in which someone is most likely to pop bottles.\n\nBut how did these posts make their way to Twitter? That might help us further examine the trends, and luckily, Twitter\u2019s API allowed me to pull the names of every client used to post a \u201cpooping bottles\u201d tweet.\n\nThe most popular client was \u201cTwitter for iPhone,\u201d responsible for a whopping 1,116 tweets (given the iPhone\u2019s position as a luxury status symbol, its dominance makes sense among the \u201cpoop bottles\u201d crowd). It was followed by the \u201cTwitter Web Client\u201d (692 tweets) and \u201cTwitter for Android\u201d (505 tweets). Altogether, these three first-party options cover 2,313 of the 3,470 tweets I scraped, or 67 percent.\n\nSo why did the \u201cpooping bottles\u201d tweets disappear? That first-party mobile clients alone cover nearly half of the errors also leads me to theorize that many of the \u201cpooping bottles\u201d errors were caused by autocorrect, which has presumably gotten a lot smarter over the past decade and thus led to a decline in the rate of error. Many of the 90-plus clients listed in the data were mobile (it is impossible for me to determine what type of browser \u201cTwitter Web Client\u201d tweets originated from).\n\nTo test this hypothesis, I pulled the names of the ten-most-popular mobile clients used by \u201cpooping bottles\u201d and calculated their percentage relative to the total number of typo tweets each year. What I found was \u2026 confusing. By the time the typo peaked in 2012, mobile posting represented 62 percent of that year\u2019s tweets. The percentage of mobile tweets continued to rise until it now constitutes pretty much all \u201cpooping bottles\u201d tweets. So the overall number of error tweets has decreased. But, if autocorrect is getting better, and mobile now encompasses nearly all of the errors, how are the errors still happening? Maybe autocorrect has been trained inadequately. Maybe people think it\u2019s funny. Maybe a cultish group of fanatics are actually pooping bottles. A mystery \u2026\n\nTechnological changes may account for some of this, but in reality, the typo\u2019s decline is because the public\u2019s fascination with \u201cpopping bottles\u201d itself is in decline. This n-gram from the lyrics database Genius shows that references to \u201cpopping bottles\u201d in songs peaked at roughly the same time, 2011 and 2012, that \u201cpooping bottles\u201d peaked on Twitter (no rapper has yet to mention pooping bottles on a track, unfortunately). Put simply, \u201cpopping bottles\u201d has been superseded by similar but not identical activities like going to \u201cthe turn up function,\u201d as Macklemore once put it.\n\nFarewell, \u201cpooping bottles\u201d typo. You burned fast and bright and very funny.", "description": "The famous typo peaked in 2012. But how did it start and why did it disappear?
