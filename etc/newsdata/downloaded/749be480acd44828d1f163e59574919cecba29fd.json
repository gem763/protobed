I didn't know he was coming but it was great to put on a performance like that for him.'\n\nWesley scored a brace in Aston Villa's victory against Norwich at Carrow Road on Saturday\n\nThe visitors' frontman capitalised on Ben Godfrey's error to fire beyond Michael McGovern\n\nMATCH FACTS Norwich (4-2-3-1): McGovern 6; Aarons 5, Amadou 4, Godfrey 5, Lewis 5; Leitner 5, McLean 4; Buendia 5, Stiepermann 5 (Roberts, 76), Cantwell 7 (Srbeny 80); Pukki 4 (Drmic, 84) Subs not used: Byram, Idah, Famewo, Mair Booked: Pukki Aston Villa (4-3-3): Heaton 7; Guilbert 5, Engels 7 (Konsa, 75), Mings 8, Targett 5; McGinn 7, Nakamba 6, Hourihane 8 (Douglas Luiz, 78); El Ghazi 7 (Trezeguet 64, 6), Wesley 7, Grealish 9 Subs not used: Taylor, Steer, Jota, Davis Booked: McGinn Referee: Andrew Madley 6\n\nTwo goals from centre-forward Wesley and further strikes from Grealish, Conor Hourihane and substitute Douglas Luiz ended a run of 10 away defeats in the top flight for Villa. Substitute Josip Drmic scored a stoppage-time consolation for Norwich, which Smith missed as he needed to go to the toilet.\n\nWesley could have had a first-half hat-trick, but his penalty was saved by Michael McGovern, the third-choice goalkeeper for injury-ravaged Norwich, whose manager Daniel Farke will want to forget his 100th league match in charge.\n\n'I'm really pleased with Wesley,' said Smith. 'He's only 22, a long way from his family. He has a big price tag on his shoulders. He didn't play that well last week, he admitted that to me, then he has put in a performance that he is capable of. There's room for improvement.'\n\nStarting on the left of an attacking three, Grealish was given a free role by Smith and repaid him with a creative masterclass. Hourihane and Tyrone Mings, booed throughout because of his spell at Ipswich, were also very impressive, but Grealish, local boy and captain, is the one Villa have been waiting for.\n\nWesley then pounced from close range to double Aston Villa's lead on the half-hour mark\n\nWesley celebrates after scoring Aston Villa's second goal of the game on Saturday afternoon\n\nVilla's striker later saw a penalty superbly saved by McGovern five minutes before the break\n\nJack Grealish extended Aston Villa's lead further in the second half with an unerring strike\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was his first top-flight goal in four years and more performances like this from him will attract the attention of Gareth Southgate and make Villa believe they can charge up the table. For Norwich, last month's win over Manchester City already feels a long time ago.\n\nMcGovern was playing his first senior game since April 2017, because of injuries to Tim Krul and Ralf Fahrmann, two of 10 injured players for Norwich.\n\nVilla struck first when Anwar El Ghazi crossed from the right, and Wesley was allowed to control the ball on his chest before poking it past McGovern. Two flares were launched on to the pitch from the Villa section, claret and blue smoke briefly filling the air.\n\nVilla moved up a gear. El Ghazi nodded against the bar after Wesley's header had cannoned back off McGovern's chest, before John McGinn curled just wide. Then, shortly before the half-hour mark, Norwich were convinced they should have had a penalty when Todd Cantwell's deflected cross hit the back of Mings' arm but, after appearing to consult VAR, referee Andrew Madley played on.\n\nThe visitors' captain played a one-two with Anwar El Ghazi before steering into the far corner\n\nConor Hourihane's superb strike added further gloss to the scoreline for Dean Smith's side\n\nVilla made the most of the close call by taking the lead almost immediately following a fine move down the left involving Grealish, Matt Targett and Hourihane, with Wesley again left alone in the six-yard box to tap in Hourihane's low cross.\n\nThe Brazilian should have had his hat-trick seven minutes later when Villa were awarded a penalty for a clear trip by Kenny McLean on Hourihane, only for McGovern to stop the spot-kick and then block Wesley's follow-up.\n\nThat should have given Norwich - still very much in the game - momentum, yet Villa again showed more quality in attack. Grealish glided from left to right, found El Ghazi and then steered the return pass past McGovern.\n\nBy this time, Norwich were increasingly ragged, yet persisted in attempting to play out from the back. The plan led to Villa's fourth as Targett robbed Emiliano Buendia on the edge of the penalty area and Hourihane drove beyond McGovern from 20 yards.\n\nThe Irish midfielder received the ball on the edge of the box and blasted beyond McGovern\n\nSubstitute Douglas Luiz added further gloss to the scoreline late on with a superb strike\n\nNorwich struggled to repel the visitors and looked forlorn after Wesley's second in the first half\n\nThe hosts would grab a late consolation, however, when Josip Drmic scored from close range\n\nThe one concern for Smith will be centre back Bjorn Engels, who appeared to sustain an ankle injury in a tussle with Teemu Pukki. Nothing could derail Villa in this one, though, and Douglas Luiz - on for Hourihane - curled in a spectacular fifth seven minutes from time.\n\nThe sole blight on Villa's performance came when goalkeeper Tom Heaton was surprised by Mings' miscued clearance and substitute Josip Drmic tapped home.\n\nFarke said: 'The most important thing is to stick together. I didn't expect a situation where there would be so many injured.'", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT CARROW ROAD: Dean Smith promised to give the Duke of Cambridge a ticket for Aston Villa's home game with Brighton after they produced a display to delight him.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/17/19336862-0-image-a-64_1570291571787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
