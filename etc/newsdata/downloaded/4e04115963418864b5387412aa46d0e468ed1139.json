REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Before starting his first address before the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, 38-year-old El Salvador President Nayib Bukele asked the audience to hold on a second, took out his phone, and snapped a selfie.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, many more people will see this selfie than will hear this speech,\u201d Bukele quipped before delivering his address calling on the United Nations to change with the times and for world leaders to do more to connect with their countries\u2019 youth.\n\nThe former mayor of the capital, San Salvador, who took office in June, is a prolific user of social media. In his speech, he attributed his election victory to his mastery of platforms like Facebook Live, which he said his political opponents did not fully grasp.\n\nIn another made-for-social-media moment, Bukele\u2019s wife Gabriela brought their baby daughter Layla to hear the president\u2019s address.\n\nAfter finishing his speech, Bukele uploaded the photo to Twitter, where it received more than 7,000 likes in less than an hour. The picture showed him smiling in front of the U.N. logo - a map of the world surrounded by olive branches - and Argentine U.N. Ambassador Martin Garcia Moritan, one of several General Assembly vice presidents.\n\n\u201cMaybe in a few years, thousands of us will not have to travel to New York to meet in this building,\u201d Bukele said. \u201cA series of videoconferences would have cost several hundred million dollars less, and I\u2019m sure it would have the same effect, if not greater.\u201d", "description": "Before starting his first address before the United Nations General Assembly on Thursday, 38-year-old El Salvador President Nayib Bukele asked the audience to hold on a second, took out his phone, and snapped a selfie.", "authors": ["Luc Cohen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434313472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P248", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
