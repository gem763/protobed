He was 95 years old.\n\n\u201cIt is with the utmost sadness that I announce the passing of Zimbabwe\u2019s founding father and former President, Cde Robert Mugabe,\u201d his successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, said in a message from his official Twitter account Friday morning. \u201cCde Mugabe was an icon of liberation, a pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to the emancipation and empowerment of his people. His contribution to the history of our nation will never be forgotten.\u201d\n\nSaviour Kasukuwere, a former minister under Mr. Mugabe and confidante of his family, said the former president died at a hospital in Singapore where he had been receiving medical treatment since April.\n\nMr. Mugabe\u2019s topsy-turvy rule became the narrative of Zimbabwe\u2019s independence story. In 1980, he was elected prime minister of the newly independent nation and initially went to great lengths to cultivate goodwill among white people. He would frequently invite Ian Smith, the erstwhile leader of the white-minority government that ran Rhodesia, to tea. The former colony had detached itself from the British Empire 15 years earlier, but many white settlers retained deep ties to Britain.\n\nWhen his Zanu-PF party lost control of Parliament in 2000, in part because white farmers had swung their support behind a rival, Mr. Mugabe felt betrayed. In keeping with a pattern that would define his long political career, he moved to neutralize his opponents, giving the green light for veterans of Zimbabwe\u2019s liberation war to invade white-owned farms.\n\nAn expanded version of this story is available at WSJ.com", "description": "Less than two years ago, he was toppled by a bloodless coup", "authors": ["Peter Wonacott", "Gabriele Steinhauser"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FY782_mugabe_ZG_20171121105427.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
