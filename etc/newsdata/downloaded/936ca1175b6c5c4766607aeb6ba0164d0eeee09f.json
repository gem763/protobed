And EU citizens make enormous contributions to our society, economy and culture,\u201d she said.\n\nBack in 2016, voters were blitzed by hardline anti-immigration messages such as Vote Leave\u2019s notorious stoking of fears about Turkish immigration by claiming the Muslim country could join the EU by 2020.\n\nIn the days before the referendum, Nigel Farage unveiled his inflammatory \u201cBreaking Point\u201d poster of desperate refugees, which was condemned as akin to 1930s fascist propaganda.\n\nOnce informed about the immigration controls the UK could be introducing already, public opposition to EU rules falls away dramatically, the poll found.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of those surveyed (64 per cent) said the \u201cthree-month rule\u201d would provide \u201cenough control\u201d over EU immigration, including most Conservatives (61 per cent) and most Leave supporters (58 per cent).\n\nDr Alan Renwick, the deputy director of UCL\u2019s Constitution Unit, said: \u201cThese results suggest that a majority of British adults would be content with a system that enforced all the controls available to it on EU immigration.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to accessing the single market and controlling immigration, it may be that the choice is not such an either/or one as is often supposed.\u201d\n\nAnd Dr Lee de-Wit, director of the political psychology lab at Cambridge University, pointed to the huge attention given to \u201cmisinformation in political campaigns\u201d, adding: \u201cThis poll highlights the simpler phenomenon of \u2018missing information\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe survey, of more than 1,000 British adults, carried out by YouGov between 20 and 30 August, builds on previous polls finding remarkable changing attitudes towards immigration.\n\nIn April, an Ipsos Mori survey for the BBC, found it was a concern for only 11 per cent of people \u2013 the lowest level since 2001.\n\nA month earlier, the same company found that British adults expressing positive views about immigration\u2019s impact outnumbered those with negative views.", "description": "The public no longer believes it is necessary to leave the EU to control\u00a0immigration\u00a0in an extraordinary turnaround since the Brexit referendum,\u00a0a survey has found, Voters \u2013 including Leave supporters \u2013 said they now judge that existing EU rules provide \u201cenough control\u201d on incomers from the continent, without the need for the UK to pull out.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/18/17/border-control-heathrow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
