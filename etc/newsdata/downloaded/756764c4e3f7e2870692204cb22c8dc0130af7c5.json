There\u2019s four points for a win, and bonus points available for scoring four-or-more tries or losing by a margin of seven or fewer points.\n\nIf both Pool A games were to be called off, all four teams would get two points and credited with a 0-0 scoreline - and that would allow the Japanese and Irish into the quarterfinals. Ireland beat Scotland on the opening weekend but lost to Japan, which is 3-0 in the pool stage. Scotland rebounded from the loss to Ireland to win its next two games.\n\nThe anticipated impact of Typhoon Hagibis has already forced the cancellation of two matches scheduled for Saturday - the Pool C decider between England and France at Yokohama, near Tokyo, and the Pool B game between New Zealand and Italy in Toyota.\n\n\u201cYou do sympathize. We all knew there was going to be a risk and a lot of the managements have spoken about the \u2018what ifs?\u2019 around the World Cup,\u201d Ireland scrum coach Greg Feek said Friday. \u201cOf course you\u2019d be disappointed, and all the rest of it. But that\u2019s out of our hands.\u201d\n\nFeek, who played test rugby for New Zealand, said it has been important for Ireland\u2019s players not to get too distracted by the growing typhoon talk - or about what might happen to the Scots.\n\n\u201cFrom our point of view, as soon as we knew we had a game on, no matter what happens on Sunday we need to win our game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good group of guys in keeping our focus on a good Samoan team.\u201d\n\nThe 44-year-old Feek has previously lived in Japan, so he knows about weather threats.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t control these things,\u201d he said. \u201cPlayers and other teams have been affected, and fortunately our (game) is going ahead. No matter what decision is made, it wouldn\u2019t have been easy calling a game of rugby off \u2026 let alone at the World Cup.\u201d\n\nNot everyone has been so understanding about the decision to cancel games.\n\nItaly\u2019s veteran captain Sergio Parisse blasted tournament organizers as \u201cridiculous\u201d for not putting into place what he called a \u2018Plan B\u2019 to ensure games got re-arranged. He believed Italy was disrespected, and went as far as saying the match would not have been cancelled if the defending champion All Blacks needed the points to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nIreland\u2019s players sympathized on a personal level with Parisse, but kept in mind wider safety issues.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for players like Parisse, potentially playing in their last World Cup game and they don\u2019t get to do it against New Zealand,\u201d Ireland winger Keith Earls said. \u201cYou can\u2019t not feel sorry (for him). But I\u2019m not going to get into the politics of the other stuff.\u201d\n\nBackrower CJ Stander added: \u201cIt\u2019s tough \u2026 but there\u2019s safety and what needs to be done. If I would have been in that situation, personally it would have been tough as well. We\u2019re lucky enough our game is going ahead.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Ireland's sympathy for Scotland's predicament at the Rugby World Cup only stretches so far.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jerome Pugmire"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
