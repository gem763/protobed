Al Green (D-TX) accused President Donald Trump of exhibiting \u201chate,\u201d which he argued has caused \u201csocietal changes in a very harmful way.\u201d\n\nGreen said, When asked about Trump\u2019s lynching comments, Green said, \u201cHate does not dissipate simply because the person who initiated it has left the scene as it were. The president has done some things to cause societal changes in a very harmful way. I talk to people who are now telling me that on their jobs, they\u2019re having people say and do things they did not anticipate. I read a story from the Jerusalem Post recently where in the American Jewish community has found eight or more of ten persons believe anti-semitism has spiked in recent years.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the empirical evidence seems to indicate that it\u2019s on the rise,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the president is contributing to this with his words, deeds, and actions. There are very fine people among the bigots in Charlottesville, were a woman was killed, to says Muslims ought to be banned from the country and then put a policy in place, to use lynching, something we know is not the equivalent of Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution which deals with impeachment. Not equivalent in any way, but to compare it to the impeachment, the president goes beyond the pale.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Sunday's broadcast of\u00a0 MSNBC's \"Weekends With Alex Witt,\" Rep.
