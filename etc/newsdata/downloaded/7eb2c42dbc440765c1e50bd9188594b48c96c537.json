A peck on the cheek when we said goodbye.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nI would have probably put the band in another room. It was quite hard to chat with someone playing the drums 6ft away. They were very good, though.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n8.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nI\u2019d be happy to if our paths crossed.\n\nOlivia on Patrick\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nA sudden romance or exciting crush.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nBig business guy. He wanted to order steak for starters and steak for main.\n\nWhat did you talk about?\n\nHe was a great conversationalist. We spoke about everything from bikes and terrible flatmates to Naples and negronis (he had his first that evening).\n\nAny awkward moments?\n\nThere was some great live music, but there was a period where we couldn\u2019t hear what the other was saying without leaning in quite intimately. I think I\u2019m an awkward queen, though.\n\nGood table manners?\n\nHe was up for sharing food, which I rate. But he got up to go to the loo while I was still eating.\n\nBest thing about Patrick?\n\nHe had really great chat, asked thoughtful questions and was interested in loads of different things.\n\nWould you introduce him to your friends?\n\nNot as a love interest.\n\nDescribe Patrick in three words\n\nCurious, open-minded, fun.\n\nWhat do you think he made of you?\n\nHe probably thought I was a weirdo.\n\nDid you go on somewhere?\n\nNo. I had work early the next day and he needed to get to Brighton.\n\nAnd... did you kiss?\n\nA friendly peck.\n\nIf you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?\n\nI would probably have made the date a different night so we could have gone on somewhere. It\u2019s difficult to know after one dinner.\n\nMarks out of 10?\n\n6 as a love interest. The night was a high 9.\n\nWould you meet again?\n\nWe didn\u2019t swap numbers.\n\n\u2022 Patrick and Olivia ate at the Curtain, London EC2.\n\n\n\nFancy a blind date?
