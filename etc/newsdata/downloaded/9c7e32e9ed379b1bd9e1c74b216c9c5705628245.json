It\u2019s a transformative role played with so much gusto that the 50-year-old Zellweger will be hard to beat for this year\u2019s best-actress Oscar, a major coup considering her recent six-year break from the screen.\n\nBut it took us a while to get to all that. First, there was the matter of coaxing Zellweger to the interview in the first place: As a publicist kept emailing me to push her arrival back, our lunch date crept closer to happy hour. I wondered whether Zellweger, who\u2019s sometimes had a rough go of it in the media, might be stalling for time.\n\nFor nearly two hours in the hotel lobby, I watched a series of well-dressed women and underdressed men emerge from the elevator, and then Zellweger appeared, small and inconspicuous in workout clothes, her blond hair tucked beneath a weathered Texas Longhorns ball cap. \u201cThank you for sticking around,\u201d she said shyly. \u201cEverything kept spilling over.\u201d", "description": "After a six-year break from acting, the Oscar winner returns to the screen playing Judy Garland in her final year.
