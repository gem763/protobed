It also offers guidance on how to handle instances of harassment and abuse, advising, for instance, that men accused of acting inappropriately on the dance floor be asked to leave.\n\n\u201cTango is a reflection of what is happening in our culture, and for a long time our culture has allowed men to touch you when they want to and if you complain you\u2019re dismissed as crazy,\u201d Ms. Beytia said.\n\nMs. Furi\u00f3, a 56-year-old documentary filmmaker, became acquainted with tango as a child. Her father, a strict military intelligence officer who years later would be convicted of grave crimes committed during Argentina\u2019s dictatorship, made watching \u201cThe Grand Values of Tango,\u201d a weekly television show, an obligatory family ritual.\n\nThe show paid homage to the sensual, theatrical dance that arose in poor immigrant enclaves and attained mainstream appeal among Argentines.\n\n\u201cI had a fascination with the dance,\u201d Ms. Furi\u00f3 said on a recent morning, sitting in the sun-drenched living room of the apartment she shares with her German wife. \u201cThat unique embrace, those sensual choreographies, it\u2019s something that I remember vividly.\u201d", "description": "A group of activists is trying to make tango less dogmatic about traditional gender roles, and more assertive about rooting out sexual harassment and assault.", "authors": ["Ernesto Londo\u00f1o"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/reader-center/06tango-dispatch-subp1-promo/merlin_157634235_a5a03157-edaa-40c5-862e-07400d32bc92-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
