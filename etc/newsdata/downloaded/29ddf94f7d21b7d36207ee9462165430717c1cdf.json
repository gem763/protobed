I hope that other young women will see my story and be motivated and determined to achieve their goals too.\u2019\n\nKhadijah has been riding at Ebony Horse Club in Brixton every week for more than six years. She just loves being around horses and the personal challenge that riding presents.\n\n\u2018After sitting my A Levels I moved to Newmarket to ride out in the mornings and exercise the horses with other jockeys,\u2019 she explains. \u2018To get my race riding and fitness to where it needed to be, I needed to ride as often as possible.\n\n\u2018Riding a racehorse is quite different from riding the horses at Ebony Horse Club, racehorses are athletes so are built differently, they\u2019re fitter and stronger than the horses I had been used to riding so I had to learn a new technique.\u2019\n\n\u2018For someone like me to have won a horse race and made history for British female Muslims feels very important\u2019 (Picture: Mark Cranham/focusonracing.com)\n\nOn top of this, Khadijah also had to complete rigorous fitness tests to make sure she was up for competing. She had regular assesments and tough training sessions to get her to where she needed to be. But she knows it was worth it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Being able to prove that you can achieve your dreams and change perceptions is important to me, so this has been great motivation to continue making a change and inspire other women,\u2019 says Khadijah.\n\n\u2018When I\u2019m riding, I feel like I can accomplish anything, and I think all young women and girls should be able to feel like that.\n\n\u2018Riding also gives you this amazing sense of independence because you learn how to care for another being and how to be responsible. Horses are amazing, gentle animals so they can bring a lot of joy to life.\u2019\n\nAhead of the release of the documentary Khadijah had a special meeting with her hero, Egyptian runner and founder of online community Surviving Hijab, Manal Rostom.\n\nLike Khadijah, Manal, is using sport to break down social stereotypes and empower young women and hijab wearers to follow their dreams.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe documentary explores the benefits that Ebony Horse Club is providing for young people in Brixton, and culminates at the Qatar Goodwood Festival as Khadijah takes her place among a field of 11 other competitors in the Magnolia Cup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe film, directed by Tom Bolwell and Mattia Reiniger and produced by Oli Bell and his brother Philip Bell, will be released in early autumn.\n\nFor now, Khadijah is focusing on starting her university degree, but she wants to keep riding and hopes to one day get her jockey\u2019s license.\n\n\u2018I also hope I can continue to push myself to try new things, broaden my horizons and inspire other women.\u2019\n\nMORE: Mixed Up: \u2018Friends tell me I\u2019m not \u201cblack enough\u201d but I won\u2019t change who I am\u2019\n\nMORE: Gay and bisexual South Asian men launch HIV test campaign to help diversify LGBTQ+ spaces\n\nMORE: Dope Black Dads: \u2018Navigating fatherhood and the black British experience can be complex\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "18-year-old Khadijah made history after becoming the first female Muslim jockey to win a major race - now she's staring in a documentary.", "authors": ["Natalie Morris"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Khadijah-Mellah-09f5-e1571842787990_1571843863.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
