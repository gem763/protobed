After wearing a black-and-white print maxi wrap dress by Myamiko (a fair trade brand from Malawhi, one of the countries Harry will visit during the tour!) for the couple\u2019s first engagement of the day, a visit to Cape Town\u2019s Nyanga township, the royal mom arrived at the District Six Museum wearing a sky blue dress featuring a wrap waist and button details down the front.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason the dress looks so familiar \u2014 Meghan previously wore the casual chic ensemble during the couple\u2019s visit to Tonga\u2019s Tupou College in Oct. 2018. Instead of wearing her hair in a low ponytail like she did in Tonga (as well as at their first engagement of the day in Africa), Meghan let her hair flow in loose, bouncy waves.\n\nMeghan, 38, also opted for different footwear \u2014 she paired the dress with her go-to black wedges, a subtle yet cute change from when she previously wore the dress with pale blue heels.\n\nView photos Meghan Markle and Prince Harry | Chris Jackson/Getty More\n\nView photos Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in Tonga last year | Chris Jackson/Getty More\n\nThe royal duo kicked off their 2018 fall tour \u2014 which also included stops in Australia, New Zealand and Fiji \u2014 by announcing they were pregnant with their first child.
