I would say that we have choices in the world and it makes sense that if you're not a smoker, you shouldn't start using e-cigs.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Researchers looking for cause of vaping-related illnesses Replay More Videos ...

They vaped using e-liquids that contained 50% propylene glycol and 50% vegetable glycerine, but no nicotine and no flavors.\n\nAt the start of the study and then five weeks later, all of the adults underwent bronchoscopy -- a procedure that looks inside the lung airways -- so that the researchers could analyze their lung tissue and lung health.\n\nBetween the control group and the e-cigarette group, the researchers found no significant differences in the levels of inflammatory cells and proteins in the adults' lungs.\n\nHowever, when looking specifically at the lungs of the adults in the e-cigarette group, the researchers found a correlation between the amount of propylene glycol they inhaled and the concentration of inflammatory cells in their lungs.\n\nThe researchers knew how much propylene glycol each person in the e-cigarette group consumed by measuring propylene glycol levels in their urine samples.\n\n\"So people with higher changes in levels actually inhaled more, and when you look at that, you see an increase in inflammation,\" Shields said.\n\n\"But then the question is so what? How much is there?\" he said about the inflammation. \"Given that these people were no different than the control group, what it says is that we measured an increase but they were still within the normal range.\"\n\nThe study had some limitations, including that a small sample size of adults were involved and the study went on for only about a month. Also, the e-cigarettes in the study did not have nicotine or flavors.\n\nIf the study continued for more than one month and if the e-cigarettes were used more than twice a day or contained flavors and nicotine, \"it's quite possible that more use would give more inflammation,\" Shields said, \"and now we have direct evidence for inflammation from an important part of e-liquids.\"\n\nThe study is the most recent addition to a proliferation of research aimed at measuring the impact of e-cigarette use on the heart, blood vessels, lungs and brain -- but experts caution much of that research remains in its early stages, often taking place in the lab or in animals\n\n\"This is a nice start to hopefully more longitudinal studies with more participants, if able in the future,\" said Dr. Maria Rahmandar, pediatrician and medical director of the Substance Use & Prevention Program at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago , who was not involved in the new study.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n\"Really all we currently know is that the FDA calls propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin safe for ingestion or putting on skin. These have not been deemed safe to inhale,\" Rahmandar said.\n\n\"We're still learning so much about e-cigarettes. Even these components that seem like they should be safe, we have no idea what they do once they're heated up, aerosolized and broken down into their byproducts, and what effect those have, especially when they're broken down into teeny tiny ultrafine particles that can go into deep parts of the lung,\" she said. \"This, I think, is a great beginning to what we need to look at more deeply.\"", "description": "A new study suggests that vaping e-liquids, specifically propylene glycol and glycerin, may lead to some inflammation in the lungs -- but more research is needed to determine just how much inflammation over a prolonged period of time may occur.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190918111837-01-e-cigs-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
