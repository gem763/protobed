Most co-working spaces in the Thai capital are in the central business district, especially along mass transit lines.\n\nTHAILAND\u2019S office landlords have seen strong growth in the co-working market, with \u201cmanageable exposure\u201d to struggling operator WeWork, according to a recent report from DBS analyst Chanpen Sirithanarattanakul.\n\nThis is even as the management reshuffle and failed listing at WeWork sparked concern about global landlords\u2019 exposure to the troubled co-working operator - including in Singapore and Jakarta, where information technology firms have driven the take-up of flexible offices.\n\nWhile WeWork\u2019s woes have dimmed the lustre of the co-working sector, \u201cmid-sized operators with a similar business model but smaller scale were growing less aggressively\u201d and pose less risk of rental default to landlords, DBS analysts wrote in a recent report.\n\nThailand\u2019s larger players include market leader Regus and Australia-listed Servcorp, as well as JustCo and Common Ground. WeWork, a newer entrant, has four spaces in Bangkok.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nNotably, developer Central Pattana (CPN) last year took a majority stake in the Common Ground (Thailand) joint venture, along with Malaysian counterparts, with a mandate to invest 800 million baht in 20 co-working spaces across the country by 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, JustCo\u2019s aggressive Asia-Pacific expansion plans are backed by partnerships with conglomerates such as Sansiri and Fraser Property Group\u2019s Thailand real estate unit, Ticon.\n\nMost co-working spaces in Bangkok are still located in the central business district (CBD), especially along mass transit lines, such as in Sukhumvit, the DBS report noted. The floor area taken up by Thai co-working spaces ballooned fivefold between 2012 and 2018 - although it still made up just 1.3 per cent of Bangkok office space.\n\nBut the co-working market was also tipped as a key driver of office demand, accounting for about 13 per cent of annual demand for office space - roughly twice its share five years ago.\n\nReal estate consultancy Edmund Tie & Co had said in August that demand for CBD office space will stay firm in the second half of 2019 as limited prime stock pushes rents upwards, with the new office space in the imminent pipeline largely from mixed-use developments.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES ASEAN Business - THAILAND\u2019S office landlords have seen strong growth in the co-working market, with \u201cmanageable exposure\u201d to struggling operator WeWork. .
