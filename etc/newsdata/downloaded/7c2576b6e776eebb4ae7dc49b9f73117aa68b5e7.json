While the administration has tried to blunt the pain with two rounds of financial assistance, farmers have increasingly pleaded with the White House to end the trade war, saying the handouts are not enough to make up for the lost sales.\n\nThat pain was set to get worse next week. Until Friday\u2019s truce, Mr. Trump had planned to increase tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods to 30 percent from 25 percent, a hike that would likely have been met with further retaliation by China and been particularly burdensome for consumers and businesses going into the holiday season.\n\nMr. Trump said on Friday that China has agreed to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of American farm goods annually, after scaling up over a period of two years. He compared the figures to annual Chinese purchases before the trade war, which were about $24 billion.\n\n\u201cThe deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday morning. \u201cIn fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d\n\nThe compromise is even more timely for Mr. Xi. Sharply rising food prices have become a national issue in China. A lethal epidemic among the country\u2019s pigs, with mortality as high as what people in Europe faced during the Black Death of the mid-14th century, has sent prices skyward for pork as well as for alternatives like beef and lamb.\n\nAs the Chinese public has begun asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef?\u201d, China\u2019s trade negotiators suddenly have an answer: It can come from the United States, along with a lot of pork, soybeans and other food.", "description": "President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to a compromise on trade in recent days as they feel political pressures at home and face weakening economies.", "authors": ["Keith Bradsher", "Ana Swanson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/us/politics/12dc-tradechina-sub1/12dc-tradechina-sub1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
