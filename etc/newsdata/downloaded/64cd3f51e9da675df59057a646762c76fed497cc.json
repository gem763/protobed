It ended the day down, at $11.75.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cVirgin Galactic is making history again today as it becomes the world\u2019s first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company,\u201d chief executive George Whitesides said in a statement. \u201cFor the first time, anyone will have the opportunity to invest in a human spaceflight company that is transforming the market.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Virgin Galactic debut is a major milestone for the fast-growing space sector, which is projected to be worth $2.7 trillion by 2045, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For years, it has been locked in competition with fellow billionaire-led enterprises, such as Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin. Bezos has said Blue Origin is vying to build a lunar lander for NASA, as it aims to return astronauts to the moon by 2024. (Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)\n\nVirgin Galactic was founded in 2004 but suffered serious setbacks after a spaceship came apart during a test flight over the Mojave Desert in 2014, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury. The company has raised more than $1 billion since its inception, but much of it came directly from Branson. Boeing recently invested $20 million for a 1 percent stake in the company, which said its first commercial flights would commence in mid-2020.\n\nAD\n\nWith the capital it raises by going public, Virgin Galactic said it will be able to sustain its operations until it begins commercial flights and starts generating its own revenue. The company estimates it will carry more than 1,500 tourists a year by 2023, according to a regulatory filing, and generate close to $600 million in revenue. But it remains to be seen whether commercial spaceflight will truly take off.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNo disrespect, but Virgin Galactic is both a plan and a dream, rather than a secure cashflow,\u201d Swen Lorenz of Undervalued Shares wrote in a research note ahead of the company\u2019s NYSE debut.\n\nSo far, Virgin has flown its vehicle SpaceShipTwo to the edge of space twice. The first flight, in December, was with two test pilots. The second, in February, had two pilots and a crew member. The five members of the flights were awarded commercial astronaut wings by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nAD\n\nMore than 600 people in 60 countries \u2014 including pop star Justin Bieber \u2014 have put down more than $80 million in deposits to join Virgin Galactic\u2019s reservation list; that\u2019s $250,000 a ticket. The company\u2019s customer backlog alone would double the number of people who have ever gone to space. Earlier this month, it unveiled the sleek spacesuits Under Armour built for its passengers.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWith our proprietary spaceflight system, special airspace access at Spaceport America, globally-recognized brand and broad investor interest, we believe Virgin Galactic is ideally positioned to capitalize on the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar commercial space market and ultimately open space to thousands of new astronauts,\u201d Branson said before trading began Monday, according to a statement.\n\nUnlike a traditional rocket that launches vertically, Virgin Galactic has built a spaceplane that is tethered to the belly of a carrier airplane, which hoists it to an altitude of about 40,000 feet. There, the spaceplane is released, fires its engine and races through the atmosphere to the edge of space, where passengers would spend about four minutes in a weightless environment.\n\nThe company is still transitioning from test facilities to its permanent home in rural New Mexico: Spaceport America, the \u201cworld\u2019s first purpose-built commercial spaceport,\u201d which cost New Mexico taxpayers $220 million to build.\n\nAD", "description": "The debut is a major milestone for the fast-growing space sector, which is projected to be worth $2.7 trillion by 2045.", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HCqOivcQkp-Un9OdSVfY-ICWVok=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RZE5ENXKEYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
