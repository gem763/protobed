Chinese internet giants listed in the U.S. were hit hard. Alibaba BABA, -5.15% fell 5% and Baidu BIDU, -3.67% lost nearly 4%.\n\nSee: What investors need to know about a potential White House effort to block U.S. investment in China\n\nEven though \u201ctrade wars are good, and easy to win\u201d, according to President Trump in March 2018, the White House now feels the need to widen the struggle with China from a dispute about traded goods and intellectual property rights into a whole new arena involving potential capital controls.\n\nThe move comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-China relations, as the two countries seek a resolution of the trade dispute in talks in Washington on Oct. 10-11, with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nFor Chinese investors though Monday will be the last chance to react to the new risk before a five day market closure until Oct. 8 to mark the 70th anniversary of the Communist Party taking power in 1949.\n\nU.S. investment in China\u2019s domestic markets is limited with residents holding only about $203 billion of mainland Chinese financial assets as of June, according to the U.S. Treasury, but this month China removed another hurdle for foreign investment in its stock and bond markets.\n\nChina also recently launched the so-called Star board in Shanghai with looser trading rules to encourage China\u2019s startups to list on local exchanges rather than in the U.S. or Hong Kong, but for now major Chinese companies depend on raising capital in the U.S. The market capitalization of Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges is about $1.2 trillion, according to a report by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s potential new policy reported Friday was preceded by the introduction in Congress of two bipartisan bills aimed at pushing U.S.-listed Chinese firms to comply with auditing rules in the U.S. and if those companies failed to submit to regulatory oversight, they would face de-listing.\n\nCitigroup described the proposed legislation as the most extreme potential American move against China in the escalating rivalry between the world\u2019s largest two economies: restricting access to U.S. finance. The bills could \u201chave a profound impact\u201d on the more than 200 Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges, Citigroup economist Cesar Rojas wrote in a report earlier this month.\n\nIf the White House were to go through with the plan to restrict U.S. - China capital flows, \u201cit would be an unmitigated disaster,\u201d Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale University and former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, said in a CNBC interview on Friday.\n\n\u201cOpen access to each other\u2019s markets is really important, especially with China likely to be the biggest consumer market in the world in the first half of this century,\u201d Roach said.\n\n\u201cWith the global economy really weakening, recession likely in Europe, downside in Japan and throughout east Asia, the American consumer has really been the only thing that\u2019s held the economy afloat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with businesses in the U.S. turning cautious on capital spending, the same businesses that make decisions on hiring, if they pull the plug on job growth, then consumers are in trouble.\u201d\n\nU.S. consumers already cited trade policy as a negative factor, slowing U.S. economic progress in a Conference Board survey last week.\n\nGiven given Trump\u2019s accusation that China is manipulating its currency, Friday\u2019s report also raises the risk of widening the U.S - China struggle over trade and capital flows still further into a currency war, as China promotes the global use of the yuan in competition with the U.S. dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. For now though, in a Friday note Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pand is keeping a near term forecast for the yuan to drop to 7.2 per dollar, \u201cin light of renewed uncertainty around portfolio flows,\u201d along with the expectation that the U.S. proceeds with the next round of tariff hikes as scheduled on Oct. 15\u201d.\n\nThe bigger picture\n\nThe bigger picture here though is that Trump\u2019s trade war is driven by U.S. anxiety over China\u2019s rise to the become the second largest economy in the world in one generation, rather than by economic rationality, argues Koichi Hamada of Yale University and a special adviser to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan has seen this movie before in its own struggles with the U.S. over trade policy in the 1980s.\n\nIndeed, the U.S - China trade dispute reminds historians and foreign policy analysts of what is called the \u201cThucydides Trap\u201d in which a series of trade and shipping disputes between ancient Athens and Sparta in the 5th century BC escalated into the 27-year long Peloponnesian War which ultimately destroyed both the two regional superpowers of the day.\n\nAs for economic rationality, as Robert Barro, an economic professor at Harvard University, has noted recently, the reason that countries participate in international trade is to get imports of consumer goods and capital equipment in exchange for exports. Exports are simply the goods that Americans are willing to part with to acquire something they want or need. As economists have noted for two centuries international trade also boosts the size of the overall economic pie, because it means that countries can focus on doing whatever they do best, producing goods in areas where they are relatively more productive.\n\nBut by embracing a primitive mercantilist model in which exports are \u201cgood\u201d and imports are \u201cbad,\u201d Trump and his adviser Peter Navarro have reversed this long held economic logic, Barro argues. In a mercantilist model, an excess of exports over imports or a trade surplus, such as China runs with the U.S., increases China\u2019s national wealth at the expense of America. In reality China\u2019s trade surplus with the U.S. of about $500 billion per year has been re-invested in U.S. Treasury bonds, helping to fund the U.S. federal budget deficit.\n\nWhile it is true that China imposes costs on foreign investment, often by forcing foreign businesses to transfer technology to their Chinese partners and sometimes by outright theft of intellectual property, imposing import tariffs only disrupts global manufacturing supply lines and undermines growth in both economies.\n\nThe favorable short term impact on U.S. economic growth from the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax cuts is now fading, and Trump has tried to pin the blame on the US Federal Reserve, but it now seems likely that the US is faced with an ongoing trade war, implying long-term costs for American consumers and businesses which could push the US economy into recession.", "description": "Is the White House\u2019s reported plan to restrict U.S and Chinese investment a negotiating ploy in Trump\u2019s efforts to get a trade deal or a symptom of a...", "authors": ["Clive Mckeef"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GG015_china__ZG_20180322104654.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
