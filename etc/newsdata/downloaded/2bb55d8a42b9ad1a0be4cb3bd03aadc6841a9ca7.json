But in \u201cKnives Out,\u201d Rian Johnson has revived the genre with an affectionate ode to Agatha Christie that has some contemporary twists of its own.\n\n\u201cKnives Out\u201d made its raucous premiere Saturday night at the Toronto International Film Festival, keeping rapt festival audiences engrossed in following Johnson\u2019s clever genre construction and the film\u2019s comic and star-studded ensemble, all of them crowded throughout a lavish country manor that one character refers to as \u201clike a Clue board.\u201d\n\nThe crime is the apparent suicide of the wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). But the famous detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig, a kind of Louisiana-accented version of Christie\u2019s Hercule Poirot) suspects foul play, and he has a colorful cast of family members and others to investigate including Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Ana de Armas. Armas plays Thrombey\u2019s faithful immigrant nurse, whose nationality none of the family can get right and who can\u2019t help but vomit every time she tells a lie.\n\nJohnson, whose last film was the contentious \u201cStar Wars\u201d installment \u201cThe Last Jedi,\u201d has already put his deconstructionist touch on film noir (\u201cBrick\u201d) and sci-fi (\u201cLooper\u201d). But his love of whodunits runs deep. He grew up reading Christie paperbacks and loving their film adaptations - particularly those with Peter Ustinov as Poirot, such as \u201cDeath on the Nile\u201d and \u201cEvil Under the Sun.\u201d\n\nHe even counts himself a fan of the recent Adam Sandler-Jennifer Aniston Netflix film \u201cMurder Mystery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just love the genre,\u201d Johnson said in an interview. \u201cEven though it\u2019s sort of a niche corner of a genre, I feel like it\u2019s a genre people love disproportionate to the amount of stuff that\u2019s out there. Whenever I say \u2018I just made a whodunit murder mystery,\u2019 there\u2019s a little glint in people\u2019s eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnives Out,\u201d which Lionsgate will release Nov. 27, faithfully abides many of the traditions of the whodunit while playfully inverting others. Though saying much would spoil the fun, the mysteries of \u201cKnives Out\u201d hover around issues of class disparity and immigration.\n\n\u201cA lot of Christie\u2019s characters - like the stuffy old colonel or the butler or the free-thinking young woman who\u2019s smoking cigarettes - these are characters that now we think of as entombed in amber as if they\u2019re cliches,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut at the time, these were caricatures reminding us of types in British society. So the idea of using that same element of caricature in the framework of this very fun mystery with a modern American setting, with modern American character types, that seemed like fertile ground.\u201d\n\nJohnson had the idea for \u201cKnives Out\u201d about 10 years ago and initially planned it as his follow-up to 2012\u2019s \u201cLooper.\u201d \u201dStar Wars\u201d changed that. Johnson is also developing a new trilogy for the expanding franchise.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a break in the sense of \u2018Oh god, I\u2019ve got to get out this Star Wars machine,\u2019\u201d said Johnson of \u201cKnives Out.\u201d \u201dBut there was something really nice about the contrast of doing a very dialogue-based movie. I could hire all these fantastic actors and give them a lot of words. It\u2019s just been an essential part of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 to some degree you\u2019re always trying to figure out the simplest way to say any thought.\u201d\n\nJohnson has some company in his admiration for Christie. Kenneth Branagh made 2017\u2019s \u201cMurder on the Orient Express.\u201d It did well enough at the box office (an impressive $352.8 million worldwide) that he\u2019s prepping another adaptation for next fall: \u201cDeath on the Nile.\u201d\n\nLike Branagh\u2019s film, \u201cKnives Out\u201d is an old-fashioned showcase for movie stars. But its appeal will, for many, be more in how it updates what can be a musty and familiar genre. It\u2019s certainly the only whodunit inspired, in part, by Radiohead. While the band\u2019s song \u201cKnives Out\u201d doesn\u2019t play in the film, Johnson (a fan) liked the expression.\n\n\u201cI hope they don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s not like the movie has anything to do with the song at all but it\u2019s a fantastic phrase,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt always stuck in my head.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The whodunit, with its puffy armchairs, missing murder weapons and meandering trail of clues, never exactly went out of favor.
