I\u2019m pleased to report that the final episode of this miniseries rebalances the tears-to-laughs ratio, sending us out on a clear-eyed but less bleak note. I do need to offer a content note that this episode addresses both risk factors and methodology for death by suicide. Viewers, please put your well-being first.\n\nAfter finding Alaska\u2019s puzzling marginalia in her copy of The General in His Labyrinth, Pudge, the Colonel, and Takumi go full Hardy Boys with their investigation into her death. My librarian\u2019s heart grew three sizes seeing them developing a decent search string, tracking down primary sources, and relying on their own background knowledge to refine their research process as appropriate.\n\nInitially, their attempts to map suicide risk factors to Alaska\u2019s behavior don\u2019t yield much. Of the signs that applied to her, she talked about death \u201cjust to be pretentious,\u201d and though she had experienced significant loss, it was years ago, and although she was drinking heavily, she had lost none of her sexual appetite. The state trooper who witnessed Alaska\u2019s car crash shares some details that make the Colonel more willing to consider that she intended to die. She never swerved or braked to avoid the crash, and her BAC was 0.21, or \u201cpowerful drunk,\u201d as the trooper puts it. But after reading the trooper\u2019s written report, the Colonel is convinced Alaska\u2019s death cannot have been purposely self-inflicted, because it was clearly an impulsive act by someone who was planning for her future. On the other hand, her failure to swerve or brake doesn\u2019t make sense as an accident, either.\n\nThe only way to resolve this conundrum, the Colonel believes, is to get in Alaska\u2019s head the night of her death. Clearly, he must get as drunk as she was, and he\u2019ll know for sure just how drunk he is by testing his BAC using the breathalyzer the Eagle keeps in his house. You know what that means: It\u2019s heist time!!\n\nOkay, I\u2019ve been calling the Eagle\u2019s house the Eagle\u2019s Nest for the last two episodes, not knowing that the Eagle himself calls it that, too! Lesson: I \u2026 am not that clever and have only ever been harvesting low-hanging humor fruit. C\u2019est la vie! While Pudge and the Colonel distract the Eagle with a semi-earnest request for some kind of memorial service for Alaska, Takumi is sneaking in to retrieve the breathalyzer, but there\u2019s a twist: Ms. O\u2019Malley is there! In a really cute pink robe festooned with cherry blossoms! I can only echo the Colonel\u2019s horrified but also very delighted response: O mon dieu! Also, I need a GIF of Takumi\u2019s \u201cthis is gossip GOLD\u201d face, and one of his triumphant dance, seen through the Eagle\u2019s window. As the boys leave, the Colonel pronounces the Eagle and Ms. O\u2019Malley \u201ccrazy cute,\u201d and I could not agree more.\n\nBack in Pudge and the Colonel\u2019s room, they learn that drinking to 0.21 BAC is very challenging! The Colonel is doing shot after shot of ambrosia to the strains of J-Kwon\u2019s \u201cTipsy\u201d and remarks that \u201cthe milk is what may kill me.\u201d I\u2019ve never heard of a fatal case of lactose intolerance, but someone needs to take pity on this child and hand him a bottle of Lactaid pills. There\u2019s no way the Colonel could get behind the wheel in his current state, which makes him and Pudge realize just how poor their judgment was the night of Alaska\u2019s death. Takumi points out that they believed Alaska was fine to drive \u201cbecause we never knew if she was drunk or not, if she was happy or not, and we always did what she wanted.\u201d\n\nTheir detecting work comes to an abrupt end when the Eagle pays a visit. Pudge explains that he asked Takumi to come over and help comfort a dramatically fake-crying Colonel, while Takumi offers that his \u201cshoulder is known as Culver Creek\u2019s best for crying on.\u201d The Eagle, bless his simple, earnest heart, is glad the Colonel has such good friends and offers the services of a grief counselor to the boys while chivvying Takumi off to his own room: \u201cIt\u2019s way past your bedtime.\u201d Bravo to this series for clowning the Eagle relentlessly while also making him a strong role model for sincere Dudley Do-Right types everywhere.\n\nOn the phone with his parents, Pudge notices a classic Alaska flower doodle on the wall by the payphone and has a flash of insight: The little bouquet of plastic daisies from her room, where are they? Were they in her room when they went through it for contraband? According to the police report, they were in the car the night of her accident. They must mean something! When they realize that Alaska might have been taking the flowers to a cemetery, they hit legacy.com, which yields \u2026 a single result for the surname \u201cYoung\u201d? Okay, I can\u2019t get derailed by this impossibility. Maybe they did an advanced search that we aren\u2019t being shown because literally nobody but librarians cares about accurately dramatizing the research process; it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll live \u2014 just know that a single-term search on a massive website is going to provide an ocean of mostly irrelevant results in 99 percent of cases.\n\nAnyway! Bingo, they find Alaska\u2019s mom\u2019s obituary. Alaska\u2019s crash was eight years to the day after her mother\u2019s death. It\u2019s all clear now: She was distraught about nearly forgetting the anniversary of her mom\u2019s death. The Colonel and Pudge race to share their discovery with Takumi, but he\u2019s down at the smoking hole with Lara and isn\u2019t impressed with what they\u2019ve learned: Even if the Colonel and Pudge do discover the truth of what happened, would it matter? Alaska will always be dead, the mystery will always go unsolved, and her friends have to live with not-knowing forever.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, tempers flare and moods swing wildly as people process their grief in different ways. As a result, the core friendships among Pudge, the Colonel, and Takumi are all unsettled throughout the episode until they return from Christmas break. They\u2019ve all had the time and space to begin to believe Dr. Hyde\u2019s reassurance that managing to show up every day for class and for their friends is evidence that they are actually okay and will likely continue to be okay.\n\nWhen the students return to campus for the second semester, it turns out that the Eagle has chosen to honor Alaska\u2019s love of reading and imagination by unveiling the Alaska Young Memorial Bench.\n\nMe, a sap: Aw, that\u2019s sweet! But it fails to capture her essence.\n\nThe Colonel, no fool: She would have hated that shit!\n\nYou say potato, Chip, I say potahto. The gang decides, at Lara\u2019s suggestion, to pursue the Alaska Young Memorial Prank. She\u2019d been saving it for their senior year, but the timing is right to do it now. The entire school needs to get onboard, and it could result in everyone getting in major trouble. Pudge is instantly in.\n\nSara and Pudge pitch their class\u2019s Speaker Day speaker, Dr. William Morse. He\u2019s a friend of Pudge\u2019s dad, a professor \u201cat a university in Florida\u201d who \u201cstudies adolescent sexuality\u201d and who is against premarital sex. The Eagle thinks this sounds promising, and when he calls the number Sara provided, Pudge\u2019s dad (a Culver Creek alumnus who was party to some pretty sweet pranks in his day) poses as Dr. Morse.\n\nAt Speaker Day, Gus the convenience-store attendant appears in a natty three-piece suit as Dr. Morse. He introduces the topic, speaking from some crumpled notes about how, among heterosexual teens, boys often objectify girls, and girls usually don\u2019t objectify boys. Lara stands up and hollers lustily at him to strip, followed by then Sara, then Ruthie, then Holly, and well, he can\u2019t disappoint the ladies, can he? Surely not when they\u2019re calling for a subversion of the patriarchal paradigm! As Takumi cues up Kelis\u2019s \u201cMilkshake,\u201d Gus yells into the microphone \u201cTHIS IS FOR ALASKA YOUNG!\u201d and rips off his tearaway suit, proceeding to gyrate and caper around the stage in an iridescent silvery Speedo. His performance isn\u2019t a patch on Magic Mike, but it is enthusiastic, and within seconds, all of the male students follow suit, stripping to their underwear and shaking what their mamas gave them, all in the mischievous name of Alaska Young, whose memory will forever be a blessing.\n\nThroughout this performance, the Eagle is somehow glued to his seat, only arising at the very end to chase Gus out of the gym, remarking, \u201cWell, that was unexpected. It\u2019s not funny!\u201d But then, in the grand tradition of initially hard-ass school administrators who wind up being fondest of the students who drive them battiest (see also: Vice-principal Van Clemmons from Veronica Mars), it turns out that the Eagle is actually wildly entertained by the whole thing, commenting that it\u2019s as if Alaska herself had written Gus\u2019s speech, and chuckling heartily as he walks back to the gym.\n\nThe episode closes out with Pudge and the Colonel finally visiting the site of Alaska\u2019s car crash and having a cathartic cry together. Pudge\u2019s voice-over is his final essay for Dr. Hyde, a lovely and thoughtful weaving together of all that he\u2019s discussed and learned in the classroom and outside it over the course of the year. In the end, although Alaska is gone, something of her essence endures and can\u2019t be destroyed. Pudge has made peace with never being certain what caused Alaska\u2019s death, but \u201cthe not-knowing will not keep me from caring. Alaska\u2019s last words to me were \u2018To be continued\u2019, and so I choose the labyrinth, even if there\u2019s no way out, even if we\u2019re all going, even if everything falls apart.\u201d\n\nAs one final prank, Alaska\u2019s friends steal the bench and install it at the smoking hole, as she\u2019d have wanted. Life goes on, as it must.\n\nFamous Last Words\n\nMusical Cue of the Episode: \u201cMilkshake,\u201d by Kelis. What a perfect little sonic bookend! Alert readers may recall that a plaintive, acoustic version of \u201cMilkshake\u201d played over Paul and Marya\u2019s tryst in \u201cFamous Last Words.\u201d Using the original reminds us never to accept any substitutes when subverting the dominant patriarchal paradigm!\n\nI promised I\u2019d keep an eye out for Wes Anderson allusions and am very pleased to sound the allusion klaxon one last time. When we see Miles at the bottom of the pool over Christmas break, that is a direct homage to a depressed Bill Murray at the bottom of the pool in Rushmore.\n\nA special shout-out to Dr. Hyde, whose steps in at Christmas to coach the Colonel through the worst of his grief. Feel your feelings! And remember, it\u2019s all right to cry!\n\nIn crisis?
