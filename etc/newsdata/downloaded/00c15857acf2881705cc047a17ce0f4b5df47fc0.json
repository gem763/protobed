Mr. Trump asked his acting chief of staff to place a hold on $391 million in aid to Ukraine more than a week before a July phone call in which the president urged his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s son, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Trump said he approved the Wednesday release of an unredacted transcript of that July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. But Democrats are also seeking details of the full whistleblower complaint. Mrs. Pelosi said if the administration is blocking the whistleblower report from coming to Congress, that is a violation of the law. \u201cThe dam has broken because this is a form of betrayal of his presidential oath and national security that is taking place in real time,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D., Md.), who supports pursuing an impeachment inquiry. \u201cTrump\u2019s not just a candidate now, he\u2019s president of the United States.\u201d\n\nInvestigation May Harm Foreign Policy\n\nPlease consider Why Trump\u2019s release of the Ukraine call transcript could hurt US foreign policy\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that he will \u201crelease the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript\u201d of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a conversation that is at the center of a growing political scandal that has prompted appeals from Democrats for Trump to be impeached. The scandal has to do with whether Trump improperly used his position to try to coerce the Ukrainian government into investigating his 2020 political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 perhaps by withholding military aid to the Eastern European country until it agreed. Trump has admitted to discussing Biden with Ukraine, but he maintains that the phone call with Zelensky was \u201ca very friendly and totally appropriate call.\u201d Putting the contents of the call out, some say, will help shed additional light on the issue. The problem is that the move is woefully inadequate \u2014 and could actually harm US foreign policy in the process. Here\u2019s why: Heads of state need the ability to speak candidly to one another, and they will only do that if they have 100 percent assurance that what they say will remain confidential. It takes a lot of trust to speak on the phone with another world leader about sensitive diplomatic and political issues. \u201cThis is a big mistake \u2014 terrible precedent, as no foreign leaders in [the] future will speak candidly with the president on any future calls,\u201d Michael McFaul, who served as the US ambassador to Russia during the Obama administration, tweeted after the news broke. \u201cPresidents need to have the right to conduct diplomacy privately.\u201d\n\nJumping the Gun by a Mile\n\nAll we have are comments from a whistleblower coupled with a document that Trump does not seem to mind sharing.\n\nDemocrats ought to at least wait until they have seen the un-redacted statements.\n\nEven if those whistleblower comments are somehow pertinent to an impeachment process, unless the charges are bullet-proof and of a spectacular nature, there is no way the Senate will convict.\n\nTrump Receives OK From Ukraine", "description": "Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry based on claims Trump .09/25/2019 19:26:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike Shedlock", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/4eac3f1e-f209-4120-b351-68e1cf258b71.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
