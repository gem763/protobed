Complemented by outstanding athletes like Marcel Brache (a stalwart at the Western Force in Australia) and dynamic sevens convert Martin Iosefo, there is potency aplenty in the backs.\n\nMLR has attracted a higher calibre of forward to American rugby and allowed those in the pack not plying their trade elsewhere to develop, and the USA are a real threat if any of the big three in Pool D have an off-day, and will certainly challenge Tonga for fourth in the group.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A vastly experienced coach with a varied career, Gold had stints in his native South Africa, Japan and at three English clubs before taking the USA job last year. Since then, the Americans have recorded their first ever victories over Scotland and Samoa and pushed Japan close.\n\nAxed as an assistant after South Africa\u2019s disappointing 2011 World Cup campaign, Gold gets a chance for redemption in Japan, and the USA find themselves in a tough pool, their coach has plenty of experience from which to draw if they are to secure an underdog victory.\n\nKey Player\n\nJoe Taufete\u2019e. Few players, let alone hookers, manage to maintain a try-scoring rate of one per game, but Taufete\u2019e does exactly that at international level as an all-action front rower. Indeed, the Worcester Warrior has more tries than any other front-rower in international rugby.\n\nIntelligent at the back for a maul and a thumping carrier, he is less known for set piece solidity, but if the USA are to cause a shock they will need to build from their scrum and lineout. Taufete\u2019e needs to get the nitty-gritty right at the World Cup.\n\nPast Record\n\nAustralia/New Zealand 1987 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (one win)\n\nEurope 1991 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (no wins)\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (no wins)\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (one win)\n\nFrance 2007 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (no wins)\n\nNew Zealand 2011 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (one win)\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stage (no wins)\n\nPrediction\n\nFour defeats and bottom of Pool C, though USA give Tonga a scare in their final fixture\n\nFixtures\n\nThursday 26 September \u2013 England vs USA (11.45am), Kobe\n\nWednesday 2 October \u2013 France vs USA (8.45am), Fukuoka\n\nWednesday 9 October \u2013 Argentina vs USA (5.45am), Kumagaya\n\nSunday 13 October \u2013 USA vs Tonga (6.45am), Higashiosaka\n\nOdds\n\nUSA to win the World Cup: 2000/1", "description": "Despite finding themselves in a particularly tough Pool C, the USA\u00a0possess an extremely talented squad and will hope to cause a shock at the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
