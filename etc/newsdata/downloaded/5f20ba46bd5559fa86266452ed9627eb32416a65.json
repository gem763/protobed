(In this study, researchers controlled the data for variables that influence digital engagement, such as age and sex, race and ethnicity, stress, social support and health.)\n\nSo banning kids from using technology altogether, or implementing age restrictions, isn't the best solution for parents who are concerned about their children's screen use, \"particularly as screen usage in some cases has a net positive impact,\" Andrew Przybylski, Director of Research at the Oxford Internet Institute and study author said in a press release.\n\nThere is an upper limit for screen time, though: This study also found that kids could watch four hours of TV or use an electronic device for five hours before it started to affect their behavior. Compared to the average amount of time that kids use devices (about two hours of tablets and smartphones, and one hour and 45 minutes of TV), these numbers are very high.\n\nLike this story?
