Chaves, who hails from French Polynesia, wore a traditional outfit made of Tahitian chocolate.\n\nDesigner Elsa Muse described the level of work which goes into such a dress. She made 2,000 individual chocolate pearls and covered them in different textures using cocoa powder and crushed cocoa to create a pattern, before threading each pearl on to an elastic string to be attached to the dress.\n\nThe Paris Chocolate Fair, which runs until 3 November brings together 500 participants and chocolate from 20 countries. Visitors can attend chocolate-making demonstrations, an exhibition on the history of the chocolate fashion show, or sample the creations of 230 different exhibitors.", "description": "The fashion show celebrated chocolate-producing countries including Peru and Ivory Coast.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/94/18/1000x563_cmsv2_4f44a5aa-3972-5df8-9f43-f8aa890df612-4269418.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
