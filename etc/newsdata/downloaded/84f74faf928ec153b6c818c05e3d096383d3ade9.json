It is, funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happened as well.\"\n\nMulvaney replied: \"We do \u2014 we do that all the time with foreign policy.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And I have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\"\n\nImmediately after the briefing, President Trump's legal team distanced themselves from Mulvaney's remarks.\n\n\"The President's legal counsel was not involved in acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's press briefing,\" said White House counsel Jay Sekulow in a statement.\n\nShortly after, Mulvaney issued a statement claiming that his earlier remarks had been twisted.\n\n\"Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump. Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\n\n\"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\"\n\nMulvaney's remarks Thursday have been seized on by Democrats investigating impeaching the president over his dealings with Ukraine \u2014 who have focussed on claims Trump made military aid to Ukraine conditional on agreeing to his demands as part of a quid pro quo arrangement.\n\nLater, they ridiculed Mulvaney's reversal.\n\n\"Mick Mulvaney was either lying then, or he's lying now,\" Rep. Ted Lieu, a California Democrat involved in the impeachment inquiry, told The New York Times. \"I think he's lying now.\"\n\nThe House probe was launched after a whistleblower alerted officials to concerns that Trump had used his power improperly in pressuring Ukraine to probe Democrats.", "description": "\"Once again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments,\" said the acting White House chief of staff.", "authors": ["Tom Porter"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da984d2cc4a0a29162d6302?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
