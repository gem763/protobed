(Reuters) - Just months after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a $16 million project to restore sandy beaches in Jacksonville, Florida, Hurricane Dorian is about to pound them again, illustrating the uphill battle that American coastal cities face in protecting their most valuable asset.\n\nPeople watch waves at the beach as Hurricane Dorian makes its' way north, in St. Augustine, Florida, U.S. September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Maria Alejandra Cardona\n\nThe hurricane, which has already caused devastation and at least five deaths in the Bahamas, is forecast to cause some erosion at about 80 percent of the sandy beaches between Florida and North Carolina as it curves northward this week, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThat figure is similar to forecasts ahead of other past major hurricanes in the region, and some of that erosion will be temporary: Sand that gets swept offshore in a storm is slowly returned to the beach in the following weeks in gentler weather.\n\nBut dunes, which are often the last buffer between the ocean and coastal buildings and infrastructure, can take months or years to naturally recover from damage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural process, but obviously with a hurricane it kind of speeds that up,\u201d Rick Powell, the 48-year-old owner of a marine construction company, said in an interview in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. His company is building a pier on the beach, and he admired the recent handiwork of the Army Corps of Engineers: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame because the dunes have never looked better.\u201d\n\nSandy beaches are a prime tourist draw in Florida. The land behind them has become increasingly valuable and developed over the last century, requiring elaborate efforts to stop the coastline from changing too much through natural erosion brought about by storms and rising sea levels caused by climate change.\n\nMost of that work has been done by the Army Corps of Engineers, which has been carrying out \u201cbeach nourishment\u201d projects since the 1950s. The projects involve adding tons of extra sand to beaches, increasing the protective buffer for the land behind.\n\nThe Army Corps\u2019 recently finished project around Jacksonville included restoring the dunes damaged by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Irma a year later.\n\nAs with all such projects, it is designed to be eroded during a storm, dissipating a storm\u2019s energy and protecting the city behind. The Army Corps says the costs of the projects are far outweighed by the potential cost of the damage they prevent happening.\n\nStill, beach renourishment is a piecemeal effort. Florida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection says that nearly half of its beaches, about 400 miles (640 km), are critically eroded.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a not a whole lot you can do preceding a storm event like this,\u201d Kara Doran, a scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s coastal science center in St. Petersburg, Florida, said in a telephone interview. Dorian\u2019s huge size and slow crawl toward the U.S. mainland only worsens the problem, she said, with damaging storm waves eroding the beaches for days at a time.\n\nThe USGS forecast that Dorian could send water surging over up to a quarter of the dunes in Florida and nearly 60 percent of the dunes in Georgia and South Carolina. \u201cThe dunes, once they erode, take decades to build back up,\u201d Doran said.\n\nChris Condon, 51, has lived in Jacksonville Beach for seven years, and says previous hurricanes have taught him that a first priority is \u201cto shore up the dunes.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re building up the dunes,\u201d he said, \u201cclosing up the entrances and making sure that there\u2019s no big gaps for the water to run through and get into the neighborhoods.\u201d", "description": "Just months after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers completed a $16 million project to restore sandy beaches in Jacksonville, Florida, Hurricane Dorian is about to pound them again, illustrating the uphill battle that American coastal cities face in protecting their most valuable asset.", "authors": ["Zachary Fagenson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425914033&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821Q2"}
