CASA has worked closely with aviation regulators in Singapore and Indonesia to review and coordinate the ferry flights, he said.\n\nA Singapore Airlines representative said the company doesn\u2019t have information to share about the matter at this point.\n\nIt is still unclear when the Max 737 will resume scheduled flights as investigations by various authorities around the world are ongoing. CASA said it is following flight profiles for ferrying the aircraft in the US, Canada and Europe. In one California facility, the cost of storage runs to about $2 000 (R30 000) a month for a plane, according to an industry veteran.", "description": "Australia has given clearance for Singapore Airlines\u2019 SilkAir to store its six Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the country, as the global grounding of the jet continues following two deadly crashes within the past 12 months.", "authors": ["Will Davies"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8838/6c98690c2fb74276986100c174f00e47.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
