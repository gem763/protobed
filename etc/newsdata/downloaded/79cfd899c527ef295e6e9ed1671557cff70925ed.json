The federal government says it has tried unsuccessfully to send a delegation of Canadian experts to China to examine the evidence.\n\nThe government has supplied an additional $150 million in insurance to canola farmers.\n\nSaskatchewan's Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said Friday the federal move was months overdue.\n\n\"We'd been calling for the national government to initiate the WTO challenge from virtually day 1 of the Chinese decision to exclude canola into their market,\" said Harrison.\n\n\"If they had initiated it in April, when I think was when we first asked them to do that, that would have been six months further along in this process than we are right now.\"\n\nThe Canola Council of Canada welcomed the government's decision because \"the scientific basis for China's actions remains unclear,\" Jim Everson, the council president, said in a statement.\n\n\"China has an obligation to explain the scientific basis for its actions as part of its commitments to World Trade Organization rules.\"", "description": "Canada has requested a formal meeting with China before the World Trade Organization to resolve a Chinese ban on Canadian canola shipments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5141343.1558129848!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1163010496.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
