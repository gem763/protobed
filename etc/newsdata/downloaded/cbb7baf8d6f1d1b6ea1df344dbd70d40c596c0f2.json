The company\u2019s most profitable shop is nearly twice its original size.\n\nCrowds of people formed lines early Friday morning awaiting Apple\u2019s new product launches, including its iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max in addition to new Apple Watches. CEO Tim Cook greeted customers to kick off the reopening, taking selfies with fans outside the store.\n\nApple teamed up with Foster + Partners to rebuild its glowing glass cube reminiscent of I.M. Pei\u2019s Louvre pyramid. The original design was overseen by founder Steve Jobs.\n\nTo manage crowd control, two new sidewalk-level entrances have been added on either side of the store, a stone\u2019s throw away from Central Park. Customers can take a spiral staircase or elevator down to the underground store. Once customers are underneath, there's a combination of natural light beaming through portholes and a new LED system above that will adjust its color throughout the day. Several trees have also been planted along with a wall covered in plants to bring life into the space.\n\nOutside the subterranean store, there are now 62 circular skylights that reflect natural light onto the store. There are also 18 shiny metal seats \u2013 what the company calls \u201csky lenses\u201d \u2013 that offer a view down into the retail space.\n\nThe store has been a destination for tourists since it opened in 2006. It will be open 24-hours a day, every day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n", "description": "Apple reopened its iconic Fifth Avenue flagship in New York City.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/hsG1qIDcdkw9Tw6il2dP2w--~B/aD0yNDg4O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/9d15b4c0-dbc0-11e9-9f76-219a25fb768f", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
