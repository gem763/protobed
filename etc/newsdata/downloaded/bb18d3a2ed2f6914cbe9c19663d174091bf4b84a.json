President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement in 2017.\n\nAmazon pledges to use 100% renewable energy by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. The company is also starting a fund to invest $100 million in restoring forests and wetlands and launching a sustainability website to report on its commitments, initiatives, and performance.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, speaks in Washington, DC as the company co-founds The Climate Pledge.

Ford (F) also invested $500 million in Rivian. Amazon will start to put electric delivery vans on the road by 2021, and deploy all 100,000 vans by 2024, according to Bezos.\n\nThe move comes two years after the company committed to power its global infrastructure with 100% renewable energy. Amazon has been under pressure from its own employees who asked the company to play a leading role in dealing with climate change. Over 1,500 Amazon employees plan to strike over climate change inaction on Friday.\n\nAmazon should lead on climate, not follow\n\nFollowing Amazon\u2019s Climate Pledge, employees say Friday\u2019s protest will be held as planned. \u201cAmazon\u2019s newly-announced \u2018Climate Pledge\u2019 is a huge win for Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, and we\u2019re thrilled at what workers been able to achieve in less than a year,\u201d said employees who organized the walkout. \u201cToday, we celebrate. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll be in the streets to continue the fight for a livable future.\u201d\n\nBesides setting a carbon-neutral goal by 2030, employees are also calling the company to stop providing its Amazon Web Services to oil and gas companies and funding lobbyists and politicians who deny climate change. These demands were not addressed by Amazon\u2019s pledge on Thursday. A New York Times report in July found Amazon is funding the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a think tank that is associated with the climate denial movement.\n\nEmployees at major tech companies are using activism to pressure their employees to take a more active role in fighting climate changes. Some employees at Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) are also planning to join the Global Climate Strike on Friday.\n\nRobert Engel, a spokesperson at Free & Fair Markets Initiative, a nonprofit watchdog that has been a vocal critic of Amazon, applauded the move. \u201cAmazon must become a better corporate citizen by listening to its employees and taking meaningful action against climate change.\u201d\n\nWrite to Krystal Hu via krystalh@yahoofinance.com or follow her on Twitter.\n\nRead more:\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews,LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Amazon wants to lead Corporate America to fight with climate changes.", "authors": ["Krystal Hu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/RALPymg1hm6aeqSN2EyjYA--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/095431f0-dafb-11e9-bf77-916b498efaf3", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
