(AP) - Southeast Missouri State coach Tom Matukewicz probably cringed just a little bit when he watched film of Missouri\u2019s first-half destruction of rebuilding West Virginia last week.\n\nThen he probably cringed a little more when he watched the second half.\n\nThe Tigers bounced back from a stunning road loss to Wyoming by building a 31-0 halftime lead on the Mountaineers, showcasing just why so many people initially pegged them a Top 25 team. Then they were awful out of the break, sleepwalking through so much in the second half of their 38-7 victory that they vowed this week they wouldn\u2019t let up like that again this season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we kept the same intensity, especially on the offensive side,\u201d Missouri coach Barry Odom said. \u201cAnd I know a number of guys are rolling in but the standard of what we need to do when those guys get in the game, there shouldn\u2019t be any drop-off.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for the Redhawks, even if the Tigers build a quick lead early on Saturday in this matchup of 1-1 teams.\n\n\u201cI feel like we got off to a really good start as an offense,\u201d Tigers quarterback Kelly Bryant said, \u201cbut the big thing for us is playing all four quarters. I don\u2019t feel like we did that.\u201d\n\nSo even after an easy victory, the Tigers are rolling into Memorial Stadium a little bit ornery.\n\nAs if the Redhawks needed anything else to overcome.\n\nThey\u2019ve only beaten one team from the Football Bowl Subdivision, and that was Middle Tennessee in 2002. They\u2019ve put a couple of scares into Kansas, but they were throttled 34-3 by Missouri in 2015.\n\nMatukewicz certainly respects the bigger in-state school, and not just for what the Tigers have accomplished on the field. He recalled the program that Odom inherited just a few years ago, when there were race riots and walk-outs on campus, and the school had become a hotbed of student discontent.\n\n\u201cIt was a Dumpster fire,\u201d Matukewicz said. \u201cThen he takes over and gets a bowl ban and it had nothing to do with anybody that was there, and they didn\u2019t lose a soul. What they\u2019re doing there, they are connected. I love the culture and the team he\u2019s build. I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d\n\nMatukewicz has seen the film of the Tigers\u2019 loss to Wyoming. The West Virginia film, too.\n\n\u201cThey lost on the road to a team they shouldn\u2019t have lost to,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think West Virginia paid that price.\u201d\n\nMILESTONE MOMENT\n\nThis will be Missouri\u2019s 500th game at Memorial Stadium, which opened in 1926 and has undergone a series of renovations over the years. The latest was a nearly $100 million upgrade in the south end zone.\n\n\u201cWe got to protect our house,\u201d Odom said. \u201cWe\u2019re off to a good start with that.\u201d\n\nBOLTON\u2019S BIG DAY\n\nThe Tigers\u2019 Nick Bolton was voted SEC defensive player of the week for his performance against the Mountaineers. He had two interceptions, returning one for a score, and a pair of tackles behind the line of scrimmage.\n\n\u201cHe played well, was very productive,\u201d Odom said. \u201cAnd I think Nick is just starting to scratch the surface on the player that he\u2019s going to be for us.\n\nSEMO\u2019S SITUATION\n\nThe Redhawks rolled past Southern Illinois in their opener before falling at Montana State last week. But the outcome of those games doesn\u2019t seem to matter to Matukewicz as much as the way his team performed.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we have a good enough team to win the Ohio Valley,\u201d he said, \u201cand really that\u2019s what the focus is, and really these four nonconference games are there to get us better, give us feedback on what we\u2019re good at and not so good at.\u201d\n\nDIRTY LAUNDRY\n\nMissouri was penalized nine times for nearly 100 yards in the first half alone against West Virginia. But the Tigers were flagged just once for five yards in the second. \u201cSo the message at halftime obviously fixed it,\u201d Odom said with a smirk.\n\nBRYANT\u2018S HEALTH\n\nAfter a solid first half last weekend, Bryant went to the locker room for what Missouri called an issue of overheating. Odom has been watching him closely this week but Bryant is expected to start vs. the Redhawks.\n\n\u201cIt was just a weird feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wanted to check and make sure everything was good. I can\u2019t really describe it. It\u2019s just one of those things.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Southeast Missouri State coach Tom Matukewicz probably cringed just a little bit when he watched film of Missouri's first-half destruction of rebuilding West Virginia last week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Skretta"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/west_virginia_missouri_football_16627_c0-141-2902-1833_s1770x1032.jpg?daf37e256360c7781e32014c7664f8091bc9ddea", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
