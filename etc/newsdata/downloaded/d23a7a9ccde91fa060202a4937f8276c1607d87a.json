MUST WATCH How measles was eliminated and then came back 02:55\n\n\"Although the overall percentage of children with an exemption increased slightly for the second consecutive school year, children with exemptions still represent a small proportion of kindergartners nationally and in most states,\" the researchers wrote. \"More importantly, in 25 states, the number of nonexempt undervaccinated kindergartners exceeded the number of those with exemptions.\"\n\nThe report noted that nonexempt students include those provisionally enrolled, in a grace period or otherwise without documentation of vaccination. A grace period refers to a set number of days during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption, but provisional enrollment allows a student without complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule. In many states, nonexempt undervaccinated students are attending school in a grace period or are provisionally enrolled, according to the report.\n\nStates with lowest and highest vaccine coverage\n\nThe new report summarized vaccination coverage data on about 3.6 million kindergarteners during the 2018-2019 school year. The data was collected by state and local immunization programs in 49 states: all states except Alaska, for which data was not reported to the CDC.\n\nThe report also included vaccine exemption data on some 3.6 million kindergarteners in all 50 states.\n\nFederally funded immunization programs collaborate with departments of education, school nurses and other school personnel to assess vaccination coverage and exemption status of children enrolled in public and private kindergartens and then to report that data to CDC.\n\nJUST WATCHED How personal belief vaccine exemptions cause measles outbreaks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How personal belief vaccine exemptions cause measles outbreaks 01:48\n\nThe new report found that nationally, during the 2018-2019 school year, vaccination coverage among kindergartners for the two-dose MMR ranged from 87.4% in Colorado to at least 99.2% in Mississippi.\n\nThe recommended coverage for MMR is at least 95%, according to the report.\n\nFor the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine or DTaP, coverage ranged from 88.8% in Idaho to at least 99.2% in Mississippi, according to the report.\n\nFor the varicella or chickenpox vaccine, the report found that coverage ranged from 86.5% in Colorado to at least 99.2% in Mississippi.\n\nNationally for the 2018-2019 school year, coverage among kindergarteners for those vaccines was: 94.7% for two doses of the MMR; 94.9% for the required doses of DTaP; and 94.8% for the varicella vaccine, according to the report.\n\nThe report had some limitations, including that the data are based on documentation from schools so some children might not be included in the data, such as those who are homeschooled.\n\nMore research is needed to directly compare regions or states -- since in the new report, comparability is limited due to variation in states' requirements, data collection methods and definitions of grace periods or provisional enrollment when it comes to vaccine requirements.\n\n\"Today's data reinforces that childhood vaccine coverage remains high,\" Ranee Seither in CDC's Immunization Services Division and first author of the report said in an email on Thursday.\n\n\"Most parents continue to protect their children from 14 vaccine preventable diseases. But while nationwide vaccination coverage is high, and even high in many states, we still see pockets of under-vaccinated communities,\" Seither said.\n\n'Clusters of refusal overlap clusters of outbreaks'\n\nWhile the CDC regularly reports on statewide exemptions of vaccinations, the agency could better predict possible measles outbreaks -- or outbreaks of other infections -- that result from declining vaccine coverage by also examining vaccine exemptions on a more local level, such as by county or school, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development , who was not involved in the new report.\n\nHotez and his colleagues conducted their own county-level examination of non-medical vaccine exemptions across the United States, published last year in the journal Plos Medicine\n\nThat study found that the number of nonmedical \"philosophical-belief\" vaccine exemptions had risen between 2009 and 2017 in more than half of the 18 states that allowed such policy at the time: Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas and Utah.\n\nOverall that previous study showed \"at least 100 counties, including 14 urban counties, that are highly vulnerable to measles,\" Hotez said.\n\n\"Sure enough, measles erupted in seven of those 14 counties, so we wound up making the first good measles prediction map,\" he said. \"I would recommend instead that the CDC publish at least county or even school based exemption rates in addition to state-level exemptions, and they should do this on an annual basis.\"\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOther research, published in the medical journal JAMA in 2016, has shown that states with philosophical exemptions had both higher rates of refusal and higher rates of disease\n\n\"Clusters of refusal overlap clusters of outbreaks,\" Saad B. Omer , a professor of global health and epidemiology and pediatrics at Emory University who led that separate research, told CNN last year.\n\nHowever, \"if it's difficult to obtain an exemption, then you have lower rates of refusal and lower rates of disease,\" he said.", "description": "There has been a small increase in vaccine exemption rates among kindergarteners in the United States, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190613115158-mumps-measles-vaccine-file-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
