In the future, further options could appear for traders.\n\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, commented in the press release:\n\n\u201cOur partnership with Amun in launching the BNB ETP will provide investors with a new and regulated asset class with a unique dimension to utility tokens, making them more accessible and reliable through a traditional financial infrastructure.\u201d\n\nBNB, currently the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, increased by around 4.5% on the back of the news.\n\nSIX grows its crypto integration\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, SIX began trading the world\u2019s first multi-cryptocurrency ETP in late 2018. Organizers, including Amun, have remained bullish about their appeal to investors, despite the mixed fortunes seen on crypto markets since that time.\n\nEarlier this month, Amun partnered with Bitcoin Suisse to launch an ETP based on the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).", "description": "A deal with Amun sees the Binance Coin ETP start trading on Tuesday, using Switzerland\u2019s popular SIX exchange", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZDMwMDI3MTNhYzU4MTg2MDM0NTFiNWRjN2NkYzZiOTIuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
