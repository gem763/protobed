These days the banks struggle to pass on a fall in rates to depositors, many of whom are already earning virtually nothing on their deposits. That means the banks have to swallow higher costs on the deposit side which they need to make up on the lending side.\n\nAnd the broader picture is that credit growth is the ultimate driver of bank profits, and this peaked years ago. We now live in the shadow of a once-in-a-generation credit boom, with the indebtedness to show for it.\n\nThere are two key metrics worth paying attention to, and both speak to this \u201cdeteriorating\u201d profit picture. The banks\u2019 net interest margins, or NIMs, capture the difference between what the bank charges you for a loan and how much it costs to fund that loan.\n\nThe broadest measure of a bank\u2019s profitability is its return on equity, or ROE. Both have been on a downward trajectory over the past decade or so, and particularly so in recent years. ROE now sits at around 11 per cent for the banks, against 13 or 14 per cent a few years back.\n\nWestpac CEO Brian Hartzer says Australia benefits from a profitable banking system. AAP\n\nReserve Bank officials give short shrift to banks\u2019 complaints of falling profitability. Aussie banks \u201cremain very profitable\u201d, the RBA says in its latest Financial Stability Report. Not only that, the lenders\u2019 returns on equity are \u201chigh by international standards\u201d.\n\nBank profits \u201cfell somewhat\u201d in the first half of 2019, but these were self-inflicted wounds. This decline was \u201cprimarily driven by customer remediation costs arising from misconduct\u201d, the RBA noted. Indeed, some of the big banks have included compensation costs in their NIM figures \u2013 which muddies the argument that falling NIMs purely reflect worsening funding conditions and heightened competition.\n\nWhich would you rather have: a vibrant CBA with a return on equity of 12 per cent, or a virtual zombie lender like Deutsche Bank? Of course the choice doesn\u2019t have to be so stark. Somewhere in between, you might say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBanks need to \"make a reasonable level of return\", Hartzer said this week.\n\nAnd that is the key question for policymakers, regulators and investors: given the world we live in, what is a \u201creasonable\u201d level of profitability for the big banks? Is it low double-digit ROE \u2013 in which case we are there now \u2013 or should it be nearer to offshore lenders, where mid to high single-digit ROEs are prevalent?\n\nThe answer is as elusive as it is political.\n\nFrom the comment above it\u2019s clear that the central bank, for its part, reckons a \u201creasonable\u201d level of profitability lies below what the big four earn today.\n\nThe related question for shareholders: are current dividends sustainable in a new era of lower profitability? Payout ratios for our big banks look high and vulnerable to an eventual rebasing. But what's a \"reasonable\" payout?\n\nUsing UBS estimates for this financial year, payout ratios range from 76 per cent for ANZ, to around 84 per cent for NAB and Westpac, to 95 per cent for CBA. On the international stage, comparable offshore retail banks like the Netherlands' ING and Wells Fargo in the US pay out around 37 per cent of profits.\n\nThe very high dividend yields on offer from the big banks suggest the market believes the current payouts are too high.\n\nRegulators, too, must balance some idea of a reasonable level of profitability versus capital buffers. But, again, it's a relative concept and Tuesday brought a new regulatory impost, this time for banks with \"large exposures\" to subsidiaries in New Zealand.\n\nSo whether it's everyday Australians, politicians, central bankers, regulators or investors, the view seems that profitability in the banking system is too high. The question remains: how far should it fall?", "description": "There seems to be a consensus that the banks are making too much money - so how much should they make?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_52/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/1595b54eca3fccf61f8453d45f6049bf9a229fd3", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
