Trump tweeted in response to the criticism: \u201cThose Tweets were NOT Racist. I don\u2019t have a Racist bone in my body!\u201d\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) launched an investigation into Munchetty\u2019s conduct after a viewer complained that the remarks were biased against Trump.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent, the BBC said: \u201cThe ECU ruled that while Ms Munchetty was entitled to give a personal response to the phrase \u2018go back to your own country\u2019 as it was rooted in her own experience, overall her comments went beyond what the guidelines allow for.\u201d\n\nNo action against Munchetty has yet been taken, with the ECU due to publish their full summary on the complaint in the coming weeks.", "description": "The BBC has upheld a complaint that BBC Breakfast presenter Naga Munchetty exhibited \u201cbias\u201d by suggesting\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0was guilty of racism.", "authors": ["Adam White"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/10/gettyimages-1148715760.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
