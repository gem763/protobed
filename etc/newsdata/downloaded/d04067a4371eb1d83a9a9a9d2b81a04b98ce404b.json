Even the slightest chance must be used. A no deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU.\"\n\nWill there be a Brexit deal?\n\nVaradkar and Johnson on Thursday. Noel Mullen via Reuters\n\nWhile some progress does appear to have been made at the meeting, the EU remains far apart from the UK's position, with customs proposals by far the biggest sticking point.\n\nJohnson called last week for the Irish backstop to be replaced with a plan that would see Northern Ireland remain in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union along with the rest of the UK.\n\nBut Brussels has said it will not accept the proposal on the grounds that it would require customs checks on the island of Ireland, which it says would threaten the Irish peace settlement.\n\nVaradkar's words Thursday indicated that Johnson might have shifted his red lines and could now be willing to keep Northern Ireland in the customs union.\n\nBut any concession that would keep Northern Ireland in the customs union would cause a political storm within the Conservative Party, and it is unclear whether there would be a majority in Parliament for such a deal.", "description": "Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar's upbeat assessment of his meeting with Boris Johnson sent the pound soaring amid renewed hopes of a Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Thomas Colson"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da03c8c4af9096d331e49d8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
