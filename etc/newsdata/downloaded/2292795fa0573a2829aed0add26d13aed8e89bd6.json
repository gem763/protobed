The U.S. services sector grew in August for the 115th consecutive month. Additionally, job growth remains strong, consumer spending remains healthy and new and existing home sales saw a nice bump in August.\n\nBut while leading indicators are still positive, they have fallen from 6.6 a year ago to 1.1 in August. A drop below zero could have big implications for the economy.\n\n\u201cThere's some numbers rolling off in the next few months, it will mean there's a good risk of the leading indicators going to zero,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the reason why that matters is there hasn't been a recession in decades of economic tracking, there has not been a recession ever without leading indicators first going negative.\u201d\n\nThe stakes are high for the president, as a recession, or two consecutive quarters of negative growth, occurring before Election Day could be the death blow that prevents him from winning a second term.\n\nFive of the last seven presidents to oversee a recession in the two years ahead of their reelection bid lost, including the most recent example, President George H.W. Bush\u2019s defeat at the hands of President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhile keeping the economy stable at best is critical, Gundlach also says the Trump administration could borrow a page from President Barack Obama\u2019s playbook.\n\n\u201cIf you cut payroll taxes it absolutely helps the economy because that's money that's all at the middle-class level and it\u2019s all going straight into the paycheck,\u201d Gundlach said. \u201cSo that might actually help to put a monkey wrench into these indicators...if the economy is left alone.\u201d\n\nTrump could also eliminate the tariffs on Chinese goods in order to stimulate the economy, Gundlach says.\n\n\u201cWhat if we just pull all the tariffs in I don\u2019t know March, we just eliminate them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat would probably create a pretty big pent up demand. I mean if you were thinking of buying something that has a tariff on it. Well, maybe you're waiting for the tariff to be removed.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve has cut rates in each of its last two meetings, their first-rate cuts in more than a decade. Gundlach thinks the central bank is likely to lower rates one more time before the end of the year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cSo it looks like there's these tools in the kit that might help forestall a recession and then get Trump reelected,\u201d Gundlach concludes.", "description": "\u201cIf you have a recession, a negative sign in front of GDP, especially nominal GDP, that would just be horrific,\u201d billionaire bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach told FOX Business. \"I think there is just nothing for Trump to run on if the economy is negative.\u201d", "authors": ["Jonathan Garber"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/jeffrey-gundlach-Getty-Thumb.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
