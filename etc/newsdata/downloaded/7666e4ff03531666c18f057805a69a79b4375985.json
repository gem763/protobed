Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi movement has claimed responsibility.\n\n\u201cThe UK is attributing responsibility with a very high degree of probability to Iran for the Aramco attacks. We think it very likely indeed that Iran was indeed responsible,\u201d Johnson told reporters on the plane to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.\n\n\u201cWe will be working with our American friends and our European friends to construct a response that tries to deescalate tensions in the Gulf region.\u201d\n\nA UK government official said the Houthi\u2019s claim of responsibility was \u201cimplausible\u201d, with the scale, sophistication and range of the attack inconsistent with their capabilities.\n\nAsked whether Britain would rule out military action, Johnson said it would be closely watching a proposal by the United States to do more to help defend Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cClearly if we are asked, either by the Saudis or by the Americans, to have a role then we will consider in what way we could be useful,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson said he would be discussing Iran\u2019s actions in the region with President Hassan Rouhani at the UN meeting, as well as pushing for the release of several dual national Iranians who he said were being held \u201cillegally and unfairly\u201d.", "description": "Britain believes Iran was responsible for an attack on Saudi oil facilities and will work with the United States and European allies on a joint response, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432864456&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M095", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
