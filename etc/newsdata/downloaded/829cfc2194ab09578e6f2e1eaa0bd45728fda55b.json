Read on to learn more about the difference between interest rates and APRs.\n\nWhat is an interest rate?\n\nWhen you use a credit card, take out a student loan or apply for a mortgage, the lender charges you interest, which is a percentage of your loan balance.\n\nSimply put, interest is the basic cost of borrowing money.\n\nYour interest rate can be variable or fixed, and is typically impacted by your credit score and how much money you're borrowing (your principal).\n\nThere are two types of interest: simple interest and compound interest.\n\nThe majority of loans utilize simple interest, but credit cards complicate things with compound interest. That is, you pay interest on your interest.\n\nWhat is APR?\n\nWith most types of loans, like personal loans, mortgages or auto financing, APR \u2014 not to be confused with the APY on deposits \u2014 refers to your yearly interest rate rolled up with some of the additional costs of taking out the loan.\n\nCredit cards are the exception. With credit cards, your APR and the interest rate are the same thing. The annual rate is used to determine how much extra you'll owe when you carry a balance on your credit card from month to month.\n\nBut with the other kinds of loans, think of your interest rate as the base cost of borrowing money month to month, while APR refers to an overall cost of borrowing once fees and expenses are included.\n\nIt's important to note that lenders don't have to include all costs in the APR, so \u2014 when you're comparing loan terms \u2014 be sure to find out what is and is not included in the APR.\n\nComparing interest and APR\n\nHere's how APR and interest rates compare on mortgages:\n\nLet's say you want to buy a $200,000 home.\n\nOption 1: You're offered a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 3.875% and an APR of 4.274%.\n\nNote that the 4.274% APR might include discount points, mortgage broker fees and other charges that you pay to get your mortgage.\n\nOption 2: You're offered a 15-year fixed-rate mortage with an interest rate of 2.75% and an APR of 3.00%.\n\nOn any mortgage, the APR will usually be higher than the interest rate, because the APR is your interest and more.\n\nWhether you choose a 30-year or 15-year mortgage depends on whether you want to save money now or over the long haul.\n\nLonger-term mortgages have higher interest rates and cost more over the lifetime of the loan, but your monthly payments will be more reasonable than the payments on a shorter-term loan.\n\nOption 1 could be a smart move if you're a first-time homebuyer, you're looking for a lower payment, and you think you'll be moving within five years. If you're likely to stay put and can afford to pay more each month, Option 2 will cost you less in the long term.\n\nEither way, you'll have an interest rate \u2014 and an APR.\n\nJoin the MoneyWise mailing list.
