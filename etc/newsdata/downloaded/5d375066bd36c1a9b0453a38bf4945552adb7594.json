The court will initially have to decide whether to hear the case before moving on to consider substantive arguments.\n\nJohn Major to join legal fight to stop Johnson suspending parliament Read more\n\nOther senior politicians have requested permission to intervene in the case, but their applications, it is understood, have been rejected. They included Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, the Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson, and the Labour MPs Jess Phillips and Alex Sobel.\n\nOn 28 August, Johnson announced that he was seeking royal assent to prorogue parliament \u2013 ending the current session \u2013 from next Monday, 9 September. MPs and peers will not return until 14 October, effectively preventing debate on Brexit for five weeks at a crucial political moment. The Queen gave her approval.\n\nGina Miller\u2019s challenge is over the legitimacy of the prime minister\u2019s advice to the monarch. She is due to be represented by Lord Pannick QC, who represented her successfully in the article 50 Brexit case in 2016.\n\nBoris Johnson, the prime minister, who is formally listed as the respondent, is expected to be represented by Sir James Eadie QC. Eadie and Pannick are in the same set of London chambers, Blackstone.\n\nLawyers for Miller and her supporters will argue that the real purpose of the prorogation is to prevent MPs subjecting the government\u2019s Brexit plans to proper scrutiny and blocking a no-deal exit from the EU. Parliament, it will be said, is sovereign, not the executive.\n\nThe monarch is normally bound to accept the prime minister\u2019s advice, so it is not the Queen\u2019s formal approval that is being challenged.\n\nEven though the Scottish court dismissed the application, many senior lawyers believe Miller and her supporters have strong legal grounds to defeat Johnson\u2019s lengthy prorogation.\n\nThe Oxford constitutional law professor, Paul Craig, has argued that Johnson in effect acted illegally. \u201cThe sovereignty principle inheres in parliament and the totality of members thereof at any one point in time,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe very idea that parliament can be swept aside because its view does not cohere with the executive is to stand principle on its head. We are constitutionally impoverished if we regard this as the new constitutional norm.\u201d\n\nWhoever wins, the judgment is likely to be appealed. The supreme court has confirmed a provisional date of Tuesday 17 September to bring together applications from the multiple legal challenges against the prime minister\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament.\n\nJudicial review cases have been launched separately in the Edinburgh, Belfast and London courts alleging that the suspension of parliamentary business for such a long period is unlawful.\n\nLawyers for the SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC have already indicated that they intend to appeal after their application was turned down by the court of session.\n\nThe supreme court does not normally start hearing cases until after the formal opening of the new legal year at the beginning of October. Many justices are understood to be away on holiday. It will be the first time the UK\u2019s highest court has sat for an emergency application outside its normal legal terms.\n\nThe article 50 Brexit case heard by the supreme court in 2016 involved 11 justices hearing the high profile case. A similar, odd number \u2013 to avoid the danger of a draw \u2013 could sit on 17 September.", "description": "Judicial review on prorogation will be supported by John Major and Shami Chakrabarti", "authors": ["Owen Bowcott"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b85c44769991a516fb0062a78a6903f858719b/0_0_3686_2212/master/3686.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94c1c5aaa79c12d5510a554ba6fbdfa2", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
