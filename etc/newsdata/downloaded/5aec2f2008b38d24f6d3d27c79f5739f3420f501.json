Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on government operations. \u201c. . . There are a lot of hopeful signs, not the least because management is paying attention, but there\u2019s a long ways to go in the area of customer service. Connolly has proposed legislation that would provide Metro with an additional $150 million a year in federal funding.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTuesday\u2019s hearing before the subcommittee was the latest in a continuation of ongoing, periodic reports the House has required from Metro after a series of high-profile incidents, including the 2015 L\u2019Enfant Plaza smoke incident, which resulted in the death of a passenger.\n\nConnolly praised Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld for leading the transit authority out of a period that included the unprecedented federal takeover of safety oversight for the rail system, and he noted the year-long SafeTrack maintenance program, a more than $110 million maintenance overhaul that included temporary station and line-segment shutdowns.\n\n\u201cSome of these initiatives have not been popular,\u201d Connolly said, \u201cbut these improvements coincide with increases in on-time performance, customer service ratings and ridership \u2014 trends we must strive to continue.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHouse members\u2019 issues remain, however, citing a train crash this month that remains under investigation.\n\nThe crash probe is the first major test of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, the new independent oversight agency.\n\nBut among House members\u2019 chief concerns was how Metro leaders were addressing the fallout from the handling of the ethics scandal involving Evans. Connolly dubbed Metro\u2019s ethics code \u201ca walking billboard for the ethically challenged.\u201d\n\nEvans, a D.C. Council member (D-Ward 2), resigned from the Metro board in June after the panel\u2019s ethics committee found he committed a violation by failing to disclose private consulting work for Colonial Parking. Colonial, the District\u2019s largest parking company, was paying Evans\u2019s consulting firm $50,000 a year.\n\nAD\n\nThe investigation into Evans began in January 2018, just as the transit authority launched its Rush Hour Promise money-back guarantee program to win back riders and rebuild trust after SafeTrack. The probe, undertaken by the board\u2019s Ethics Committee, was conducted in secret and its findings were not made public until The Washington Post published leaked findings of the investigation and elected leaders in Maryland and Virginia pressured the board to make the information public.\n\nAD\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Paul C. Smedberg, a former Alexandria City Council member who replaced Evans as Metro board chairman, told House members that the panel has revised its ethics code, clarifying disclosure requirements for board members. New guidelines also require board members to discuss ethics investigations or allegations in public and make written reports of findings and decisions accessible.\n\nThe code also requires board members under investigation to recuse themselves from any official discussions or decisions related to their own case. Connolly, however, said the policy should go further.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI guess I want to be reassured that, God forbid, that if it be the chairman of the board, for the sake of the organization, that chairman steps aside, pending the adjudication of the issue,\u201d he told Smedberg. \u201cI highly commend that to you. . . . And it\u2019s just essential that the person we\u2019re dealing with be above reproach.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSmedberg said: \u201cWe would be open to exploring that option in a broader context.\u201d\n\nThe House panel also heard from David L. Mayer, chief executive of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission, which was created last year to oversee Metro after more than three years of federal oversight.\n\nAfter the fatal L\u2019Enfant Plaza incident, Metro\u2019s record of chronic safety problems and lax oversight led then-U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to order the Federal Transit Administration to conduct on-the-ground inspections and safety audits. The Washington Metrorail Safety Commission replaces the previous regional oversight body, which was largely viewed as ineffective and powerless.\n\nAD\n\nConnolly and others did not question the work of the new safety commission, which continues to investigate the Oct. 7 low-speed collision of two empty trains after service hours. But during questioning, Connolly stressed how clear the commission and Metro need to be when responding to safety questions, adding that such clarity and openness could help bring back riders.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me say, Dr. Mayer, in a system that\u2019s trying to recover ridership and that has lost a lot of ridership because of a loss in confidence in safety number one, reliability number two, I just think I would commend you in speaking a little more forthrightly and directly,\u201d Connolly said.\n\nSaid Mayer: \u201cWe share your value of transparency and we will be transparent.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "At a House hearing, Metro pledges to provide more transparency after ethics scandal", "authors": ["Justin George", "Transportation Reporter Focusing On National Transit", "Metro", "The D.C.-Area Public Transportation System"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/q1BcEPJJlmXgDMz79yZl85MkerY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HXKQYOV2AEI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
