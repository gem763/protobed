But the $14.99-per-month HBO Max is more than HBO Now, and to prove it, AT&T wants to give HBO Max away for free to as many customers as possible.\n\nHBO Max is going to be free for a lot of people, but figuring out who those customers are is still difficult to parse. AT&T is going to give its wireless customers who already subscribe to HBO through AT&T\u2019s services (like AT&T TV or U-Verse TV) a free one-year subscription to Max. That\u2019s approximately 10 million people. The goal is to get those people to eventually continue subscribing to HBO Max once the year is over, dropping the older HBO subscription, which also costs the same $15 per month. Also, subscribers of premium AT&T mobile and broadband services will be eligible for HBO Max bundles at no extra charge.\n\nHBO Max is also going to be a free upgrade for people who already subscribe to HBO Now, but there\u2019s a bit of a caveat: it\u2019s only free for people who are billed directly through HBO, according to AT&T. That means the offer is only eligible for customers who subscribe through hbonow.com and are billed by HBO. Customers who subscribe to HBO Now via other services, like Amazon Prime or Apple, are not eligible for the free offering.\n\nAT&T wants as many customers as possible to sign up for HBO Max\n\nSimilarly, customers who subscribe to HBO through other cable providers and more traditional pay TV providers, like Comcast, will also not be eligible for a free year of HBO Max \u2014 at least for now. John Stankey, AT&T\u2019s chief operating officer, told investors at an HBO Max media event on Tuesday night that the company is working to strike deals with those traditional providers. It\u2019s increasingly beneficial for AT&T to have customers subscribe to HBO Max directly through AT&T instead of through third parties, and AT&T has designed its systems to reward customers who subscribe directly through AT&T.\n\nDon\u2019t expect anything too soon, though. Cable providers pushed back against HBO Now when that streaming service launched in 2015, seeing it as a direct competitor to their own services that also included HBO. AT&T is instructing customers who are subscribed to HBO Now through third-party platforms to \u201cstay tuned for more details as we get closer to our launch date.\u201d\n\nAT&T wants as many customers as possible to sign up for HBO Max. Stankey\u2019s goal is to hit 50 million HBO Max subscribers in the United States by 2025. HBO currently has approximately 34 million subscribers in the US and around 130 million worldwide. Getting all of those customers to move over to a new streaming service may be more difficult than Stankey imagined. And even if Stankey manages to move all 34 million HBO subscribers \u2014 not all of whom will receive free HBO Max upgrades \u2014 to Max, HBO still needs an additional 16 million new subscribers by 2025 to hit those goals.\n\nHBO Max is representative of everything AT&T bought WarnerMedia for, packaging its entire collection \u2014 more than 10,000 titles \u2014 into a sleek-looking interface that feels more like a social network than a streaming service. There are podcasts tied into top-tier shows and human-curated \u201chighlight\u201d packages that should help subscribers cut down on time spent endlessly scrolling. HBO Max will launch in May 2020 for $14.99 a month.", "description": "HBO Max is AT&T\u2019s big bet in Hollywood\u2019s new streaming-first landscape, and the telecom company wants to give it away for free to as many people as possible.
