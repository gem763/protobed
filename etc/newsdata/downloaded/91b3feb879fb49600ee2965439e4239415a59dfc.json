Joe Biden will take the stage on Tuesday night at the centre of 12 Democratic candidates in the first such debate since the impeachment inquiry was launched last month.\n\nSeveral Democratic strategists have questioned the wisdom of Hunter speaking out at this critical moment. The fear is that it might switch the focus away from Trump\u2019s efforts to enlist the help of the Ukraine government and on to the president\u2019s home ground: his unsubstantiated claims of corruption on the part of the Bidens.\n\nHunter Biden also used the ABC interview to deny Trump\u2019s unfounded allegation that he made $1.5bn from his work on a Chinese investment company. He said he had made \u201cnot one cent\u201d from that relationship.\n\n\u201cLook, this literally has no basis in fact,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about a 2013 trip to China in which he accompanied his father on an official vice-presidential flight, he said he had gone to accompany Joe and his daughter Finnegan. He said he had not discussed any business matters at any point.\n\nFusion GPS founders to release book on Trump\u2019s ties with Russia Read more\n\nThe ABC interview is part of what appears to be a coordinated attempt by both Bidens to lance the boil of the Trump/Giuliani conspiracy theories. On Sunday Hunter announced he was stepping down from the board of the Chinese investment company. He also said he would desist from any foreign contracts were his father to win the presidency.\n\n\u201cI have committed I won\u2019t serve on any boards,\u201d Hunter Biden told ABC. \u201cI won\u2019t work directly for any foreign entities when dad becomes president.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the month, Trump stood in front of news cameras and openly encouraged China to look into the activities of his political rival and son.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Joe Biden pledged that were he to win the presidential election next year no one in his family would have any business dealings with foreign companies.\n\nHe then attempted to turn the ethical spotlight back on Trump by saying that none of his relatives would \u201chave an office in the White House\u201d \u2013 a dig at Trump\u2019s senior adviser, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his wife Ivanka Trump.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s son admits to \u2018poor judgment\u2019 in taking Ukraine job as he breaks silence over foreign business dealings", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae73caf56bb90498c87b9cf1da562d9dafacbdbc/0_38_2589_1554/master/2589.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=825352bc06998abebd326d26ae7a8bb7", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
