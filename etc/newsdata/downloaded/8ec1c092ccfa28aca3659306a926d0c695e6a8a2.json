Nothing the American president does could surprise any longer.\n\nWhat they found particularly disappointing, instead, was the servility with which his young counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, sought to ingratiate himself with Mr. Trump, pretending that he had won the Ukrainian presidency by imitating him, claiming to have appointed a new prosecutor general who would be \u201c100 percent my person,\u201d and happily joining in the Euro-bashing that has become one of Mr. Trump\u2019s trademarks.\n\nMasks were falling off. So this popular maverick comedian turned real-life politician after playing one in a TV series, this promising reformer that President Emmanuel Macron of France had hosted at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e even before he was elected, was in fact another spineless, unprepared leader jumping into President Trump\u2019s every trap.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Macron have been wise enough not to comment on this pathetic turn of events. Privately, French diplomats insist that Paris still actively supports Mr. Zelensky \u2014 even more so in light of the American meltdown. What is at stake in Ukraine for the European Union is far too important, and the risk of seeing Mr. Trump\u2019s dirty work derail laborious efforts to reform that post-Soviet country far too real.", "description": "Trump\u2019s threatening phone call underscored for Europe how Volodymyr Zelensky and his country face pressure on all sides.", "authors": ["Sylvie Kauffmann"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/03Kauffmann/03Kauffmann-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
