Since May UTX has made a saucer-like continuation pattern. I suggest this pattern will breakout on the upside because UTX is now above the rising 50-day and the rising 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has risen as this pattern has formed and tells us that buyers of UTX have been more aggressive during the pattern's formation. This is tends to foreshadow an upside breakout.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator just turned upwards for a fresh buy signal above the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of UTX, below, we can see a bullish set-up with prices above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is edging higher and the MACD oscillator is in a bullish configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of UTX, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $171.\n\nBottom line strategy: Will the earnings for UTX be bullish Tuesday? I don't know but the charts are very positive and I would trade UTX from the long side risking a close below $133. The $171 area is our first price target.", "description": "Let's see how the charts are positioned ahead of the earnings report....UTX", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "United Technologies Looks Bullish Here So Go Long", "Let'S See How The Charts Are Positioned Ahead Of The Earnings Report.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "James", "Rev Shark", "Jim Cramer", "Maleeha Bengali", "Bob Lang"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/bd7482e6-d9ca-11e7-8340-df62006d9151.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
