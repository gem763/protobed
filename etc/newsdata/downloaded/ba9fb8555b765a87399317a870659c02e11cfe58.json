They argue \u2014 with little or no evidence \u2014 that leniency on immigration will lead to more crime and say that social equity programs and more environmental regulation will chase away businesses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegardless of who wins, the elections will overhaul a board that, mostly, has been run by the same group of people for the past decade.\n\nBoard Chairman Sharon Bulova (D-At Large) and Supervisors John C. Cook (R-Braddock), Catherine M. Hudgins (D-Hunter Mill) and Linda Q. Smyth (D-Providence) are all leaving in January, while Supervisor Jeff C. McKay (D-Lee) is giving up his seat to run for Bulova\u2019s spot.\n\nHere are the candidates seeking to succeed them, or running in the other two contested races. [Supervisor Daniel G. Storck (D-Mount Vernon) and Democratic nominees Rodney Lusk (Lee) and Walter Alcorn (Hunter Mill) are running unopposed]:\n\nBoard Chairman\n\nMcKay vs. Galdo\n\nThe contest to replace Bulova revolves around McKay\u2019s vows to \u201chit the accelerator\u201d on affordable housing, climate change and social equity. His Republican opponent, Joseph Galdo, has alternated between Trump-like declarations of wanting to \u201cMake Fairfax Safe Again\u201d and more sober calls to scale down development in the county.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMcKay, 44, touts his decade of experience on the county board, where he\u2019s led the budget and legislative committees. He spearheaded plans to redevelop the Richmond Highway corridor and co-sponsored a 2017 \u201cOne Fairfax\u201d initiative, which uses social and racial equity as a lens for county spending and planning.\n\nMcKay has been dogged by allegations that he benefited from a quid-pro-quo relationship with a developer friend when he bought his family home in 2017, the subject of a state police investigation. He has called those allegations, made by a primary election opponent, \u201cborderline libelous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an election where people appreciate the good leadership that we\u2019ve had in the county but also are going to expect more,\u201d McKay said.\n\nAD\n\nA former Defense Department technology intelligence analyst, Galdo, 73, wants to limit higher-density development to areas where the surrounding infrastructure already supports it. He says McKay is too cozy with developers and that the \u201cOne Fairfax\u201d policy is unnecessary \u201csocio-economic engineering.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nGaldo also attacked McKay\u2019s stance on immigration, citing the recent suspension of a police officer who turned an undocumented immigrant over to federal immigration authorities as an example of political grandstanding replacing \u201ccommon-sense law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is time to stop playing politics and start solving problems,\u201d Galdo said during a recent GOP candidates\u2019 rally.\n\nAD\n\nSpringfield District\n\nSperling vs. Herrity\n\nRepublican Supervisor Pat Herrity, 59, has been a voice of fiscal restraint who championed pension reforms during his three terms on the board. He chairs a committee dedicated to services for elderly residents.\n\nHerrity wants to give the county police more resources to combat gangs and drugs and says he would oppose allowing single-occupancy housing units in areas with single-family homes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe need for experienced voices and balance on the board is clear,\u201d he said during a recent candidates\u2019 forum.\n\nDemocrat Linda Sperling, 42, wants the county to add more permanent classrooms, consider increasing density in some areas slated for single-family homes and increase access to public transportation.\n\nAD\n\nA marketing executive, she argues that Herrity has grown out of touch with the changing Springfield area that includes new immigrants and young professionals.\n\n\u201cA new district deserves new leadership,\u201d Sperling said.\n\nSully District\n\nSmith vs. Palle\n\nA first-term Democrat, Supervisor Kathy L. Smith (D) could be vulnerable in a district that was represented by a Republican for 24 years before she was elected.\n\nA former school board member, Smith, 64, says she will push for more funding for permanent classrooms in overcrowded schools and higher pay for school employees. She wants more diversified affordable housing in Fairfax, including smaller units, and says she\u2019s been working to get public transportation to a new district community center scheduled to open in 2022.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cPeople are pretty happy here,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to focus on the work I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nRepublican Srilekha R. Palle, 42, plans to focus on controlling high-density development. A health-care company administrator, she accuses Smith of being disconnected from the area\u2019s growing South Asian population, and says the supervisor\u2019s support of limiting cooperation on immigration enforcement signed by Smith an affront to legal immigrants.\n\nWhile property taxes have increased in recent years, she said, the quality of life for Smith\u2019s constituents hasn\u2019t. \u201cYou start wondering: Where is the fiscal discipline?\u201d Palle said.\n\nBraddock District\n\nRemer vs. Campbell vs. Walkinshaw\n\nWith Cook\u2019s departure, the three-way Braddock race has been mostly a fight for moderate voters.\n\nAD\n\nDemocrat James R. Walkinshaw, 37, wants to bring higher-density housing to the Fairfax Center area and eliminate the \u201ccut-through\u201d traffic that spills into residential streets from busy Braddock Road.\n\nAD\n\nWalkinshaw, who is chief of staff for Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.), vows to focus on constituent services: \u201cI see the role of supervisor as being a neighborhood advocate.\u201d\n\nHe has attacked Republican Jason Remer for hiring a campaign manager who was affiliated with a Christian fundamentalist group that has espoused anti-Muslim views. Remer said he wasn\u2019t aware of that connection and severed ties with the aide once he found out.\n\nRemer, 60, hopes to step into Cook\u2019s role as champion of a county program that steers criminal suspects with mental illness and addiction toward treatment.\n\nAD\n\nA mechanical engineer who works in renewable energy, Remer says he also supports reducing carbon emissions. \u201cThis position is not about party or creed or anything like that; it is about serving the people who live here,\u201d Remer said.\n\nAD\n\nIndependent Carey C. Campbell, a 63-year-old accountant, says his main goal is to require new developments to be near mass transit and bike lanes in an effort to take cars off the road. \u201cAll new communities would be required to be car-free and carless,\u201d he said.\n\nProvidence District\n\nPalchik vs. Jones\n\nSmyth\u2019s successor will take over as steward of a major portion of the Tysons redevelopment effort.\n\nDemocrat Dalia Palchik, 36, says she wants to speed up the construction.\n\nA current school board member, Palchik supports the development of \u201cworkforce housing\u201d for county employees and efforts to help religious institutions build homes on their land. She says the board should make sure immigrants understand the county will not assist in deportation efforts: \u201cThey shoudn\u2019t fear our local government, schools or law enforcement.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nRepublican Eric A. Jones, 67, is a late addition to the race after the August death of Paul Bolon, the GOP\u2019s original nominee.\n\nA retired Foreign Service officer, he wants to do away with a sales tax on food bought at grocery stores and says the county retirement system should move toward a \u201cdefined contribution\u201d plan like 401(k).\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of employees here, and that\u2019s going to keep growing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to avoid pension problems down the line that are just going to squeeze everything else.\u201d\n\nMason District\n\nGross vs. Aiken\n\nSupervisor Penelope A. Gross (D), 75, is seeking her seventh term in a district that is home to a growing number of Latino and Asian immigrants and several neighborhoods with aging shopping plazas and snarled traffic.\n\nGross, the board\u2019s vice chairman, says she is focused on implementing revitalization plans for those neighborhoods. Gross also has led efforts to reduce carbon emissions and is the chief negotiator on raises for county employees.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about diversity and growth and revitalization,\u201d Gross said about her campaign. \u201cBut I always end up with leadership and experience.\u201d\n\nRepublican Gary N. Aiken, 40, says Gross has failed to revive the local economy. He also attacks her for not protecting local streams from urban runoff caused by construction at Tysons, Merrifield and other parts of the county.\n\nAiken, the chief risk officer for a not-for-profit group that provides life insurance to members of the U.S. military, proposes a housing allowance for county employees who can\u2019t afford to live in Fairfax.\n\n\u201cI want to see Fairfax County continue to thrive, and I want to see Mason district rebound,\u201d he said.\n\nDranesville District\n\nFoust vs. Martin\n\nSupervisor John W. Foust (D), 68, is seeking a fourth term in a district that includes Tysons and the wealthy neighborhoods of McLean and Great Falls. His chief priority is economic development, including efforts to attract new industries to Fairfax.\n\nFoust has championed the installation of energy-efficient bulbs on county streetlights and an annual $4.5 million budget allocation toward energy efficiency investments. He promises to be even more active on climate change initiatives in 2020 and beyond.\n\n\u201cThe key is to have a Democratic agenda and to ensure that it\u2019s implemented,\u201d Foust said.\n\nRepublican Ed R. Martin, 49, is president of the conservative Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund. He has attacked Foust for co-sponsoring a budget item this year that allocated $200,000 toward legal expenses for undocumented immigrants facing deportation.\n\nAnd he wants to kill the \u201cOne Fairfax\u201d policy, arguing that it has opened the door for school busing. He said he would push for more permanent classrooms and make county spending more transparent", "description": "Energized Democrats have embraced a left-leaning agenda, spurring warnings from GOP.", "authors": ["Antonio Olivo", "Reporter Covering Government", "Politics", "Demographics In Northern Virginia"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3VAICoFNhhr9OFc1rS9zcLFDnuU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KQ6FXEUOGAI6TNXUAMZVMUBNZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
