(Gage Skidmore)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have both distanced themselves from fellow candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s call to revoke the tax-exempt status afforded to religious institutions that oppose same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone \u2026 that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us.\u201d O\u2019Rourke said during CNN\u2019s \u201cEquality in America\u201d town hall last Thursday night. \u201cAnd so as president, we are going to make that a priority, and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\u201d\n\nDespite widespread bipartisan criticism, O\u2019Rourke reiterated his stance during a Sunday interview, telling NBC News that he would ensure that all institutions that \u201cprovide services in the public sphere,\u201d would be forced to comply with certain non-discrimination standards if they wish to continue enjoying tax-exempt status.\n\nAsked by the Associated Press whether she agreed with O\u2019Rourke\u2019s assertions, Warren\u2019s campaign replied by email, saying that \u201cElizabeth will stand shoulder to shoulder with the LGBTQ+ community,\u201d but would refuse to eliminate the tax-exempt status of religious organizations as part of an anti-discrimination effort.\n\n\u201cReligious institutions in America have long been free to determine their own beliefs and practices, and she does not think we should require them to conduct same-sex marriages in order to maintain their tax-exempt status,\u201d campaign spokeswoman Saloni Sharma said in an email.\n\nPete Buttigieg has also distanced himself from O\u2019Rourke, saying Sunday that \u201cgoing after the tax exemption of churches, Islamic centers or other religious facilities in this country\u201d will \u201cdeepen the divisions that we\u2019re already experiencing.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg have both distanced themselves from fellow candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke's call to revoke the tax-exempt status afforded to religious institutions that oppose same-sex marriage.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
