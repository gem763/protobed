But you wouldn\u2019t know it from the way many people still talk and think about therapy.\n\nWhile society is more accepting of mental health than it\u2019s ever been, there\u2019s still some level of shame associated with seeing a therapist. It\u2019s not uncommon to hear phrases like \u201cNo wonder you\u2019re in therapy\u201d or \u201cYou should see someone\u201d used in a pejorative manner. I\u2019ve personally been on the receiving end of it. It\u2019s meant to be a dagger. It\u2019s meant to make you feel ashamed.\n\nThere are also still TV and movie plots that rely on salacious tropes about therapy. (No, it\u2019s not always dramatic. No, patients aren\u2019t constantly sleeping with their therapists.) There are still many workplaces that aren\u2019t accepting of regular therapy appointments. There are still people in our lives \u2015 family members, people we date, friends \u2015 who don\u2019t understand why therapy is important.\n\nTherapy should be celebrated rather than stigmatized or hurled as an insult. We should embrace more positive portrayals of therapy in entertainment. There shouldn\u2019t be a fear of repercussions at work if you need it. People should be praised for seeking mental health help, not made to feel demoralized for it.\n\n\u201cPeople should be praised for seeking mental health help, not made to feel demoralized for it.\u201d\n\nAnd changing how we view and talk about therapy is just the first chain in the link.\n\nSure, we can empower people to be more accepting of the process. But that will do little if someone is too hesitant to take the leap themselves, they don\u2019t know how to find the right therapist, they don\u2019t know how to make it work with their jobs, they aren\u2019t open to the process or they can\u2019t afford it.\n\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve launched \u201cYou Should See Someone,\u201d a HuffPost Wellness series that will teach you everything you need to know about doing therapy. We\u2019re not only flipping the script on the negative language and portrayals associated with therapy, but we\u2019re showing you how to seek help and actually get something out of it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not only flipping the script on the negative language and portrayals associated with therapy, but we\u2019re showing you how to seek help and actually get something out of it.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll learn how to start therapy if you\u2019ve never been, from finding the right therapist to making it more affordable. We\u2019ll give you guidance on what to expect once you\u2019re in therapy, like the questions you\u2019ll probably be asked in a session.\n\nWe\u2019ll give you the tools on how to talk about therapy in your everyday life, such as how to tell your boss about your weekly appointments. We\u2019ll explore the cultural aspects of therapy, from how it became fodder for memes to how it\u2019s portrayed on reality TV. We\u2019ll also highlight real people\u2019s stories on their experiences with therapy and why it changed their lives.\n\nMental health issues \u2014 especially among young people \u2014 are on the rise. We want to normalize therapy and show you how to do it within your own life and budget.
