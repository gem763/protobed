Renee Brown (pictured) shared the 10 steps to make a relationship last forever - which include telling your partner you love them 1. Tell your partner you love them: Take a moment every now and then to verbalise your feelings for your partner. It shows commitment and makes your partner feel secure. 2. Show some affection: Small acts of physical intimacy can have a 'big ripple' in your relationship. When you show affection, a partner feels noticed, respected, and cherished. 3. Show appreciation: Appreciation is also important. It makes the other person feel good about what they do. 4. Share yourself: When people share their opinions and feelings they develop a greater understanding of each other\u2019s likes and dislikes. 5. Be there for your partner: It's as important to be there for the little challenges as well as the big ones, whether it's a rough commute or a misplaced wallet. 6. Give gifts: Gifts have always been an important part in developing healthy, loving relationships. A well-chosen gift is particularly powerful. 7. Respond gracefully to demands: A big killer of relationships is unreasonable expectations. Learn to recognise and appreciate your partner's quirks for what they are: an essential part of who they are as people. 8. Make 'alone' time a priority: No matter how busy both of your lives are, make sure you commit at least an evening every week or two to be alone together. 9. Take nothing for granted: Cultivate a daily sense of gratitude for your partner and the thousands of little blessings he or she has brought into your life. 10. Strive for equality: Make sure you follow the Golden Rule in your relationship: do unto your partner as you would have done unto you.
