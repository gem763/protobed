(Mario Anzuoni / Reuters)\n\nA$AP Rocky, Trump, Sweden, democracy, dictatorship, and more\n\nIn basketball \u2014 in sports generally \u2014 there is a phrase: \u201cTrust the process.\u201d It means, \u201cThe team is down now, but we are in the process of rebuilding. Trust it. Have patience.\u201d\n\nI thought of this phrase when thinking about democracy versus dictatorship. The rapper A$AP Rocky, as you may know, has been arrested in Sweden for assault. President Trump has made this a cause:\n\nVery disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven for being unable to act. Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky, and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly! #FreeRocky\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think Trump should have racialized this affair. Either the country \u2014 the United States \u2014 is let down or it isn\u2019t. I would not, if I were president, specify \u201cour African American Community.\u201d\n\nIn any case, Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Karin Olofsdotter, responded as follows:\n\nPrime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven ha[s] explained and emphasised the complete independence of the Swedish judicial system, prosecutors and courts. In Sweden everyone is equal before the law. The Government is not allowed, and will not attempt, to influence legal proceedings.\n\nIn my observation, Western leaders often prefer to deal with dictators, rather than with fellow democratic leaders. Dictators can snap their fingers and get things done. They can bark orders. In a democracy, there is a system, a process \u2014 and the head guy\u2019s rule is not absolute.\n\nPutin, Kim, Xi, MBS, Erdogan, Sisi? They can order anyone released or jailed. The prime minister of Sweden? No.\n\nPeople are impatient with the process, as they are with democracy in general. Long may it live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 For The New Criterion, I wrote about a show called \u201cThe Black Clown\u201d \u2014 based on the Langston Hughes poem of the same name. I mentioned that the poem was printed in the evening\u2019s program booklet. And the poem came with a warning: \u201cPlease Note: This work contains the use of a racial slur.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, there was another warning \u2014 a broader one: \u201cPlease Note: This production contains racial slurs and stylized representations of violence \u2014 particularly related to slavery \u2014 as well as haze and bright lights.\u201d\n\nI had this comment \u2014 see what you think: \u201cApparently, we are delicate flowers, contemporary Americans. It occurs to me that we are a nation both trigger-happy and triggerable.\u201d\n\nIf you would like to write to me, try jnordlinger@nationalreview.com. (Incidentally, I am doing a music podcast for The New Criterion called \u201cMusic for a While.\u201d To see the archive of this show, this \u2019cast, go here.)\n\n\u2022 News from China is often hard to take. But let\u2019s absorb a little \u2014 this is far from the worst:\n\nAuthorities in western China\u2019s Sichuan province have begun a campaign of large-scale demolition at the Yachen Gar Tibetan Buddhist center, with Chinese work crews tearing down over a hundred dwellings of nuns evicted from the complex in recent weeks, Tibetan sources say.\n\nI have quoted a report from Radio Free Asia, here.\n\nThis is how totalitarian governments behave \u2014 and, specifically, how the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) behaves. I believe that civilized governments, and civilized people, should stand against this, in whatever ways they can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAm I talkin\u2019 globalism, to use one of the great bogeyized words of our day? Cosmopolitanism? I do not think we are utterly disconnected from our fellow man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 I noticed a comment from Julia Macfarlane on Twitter. She is a foreign-affairs reporter for ABC News. During PMQs, Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s new prime minister, blasted Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the opposition, for, among other things, appearing on Iranian state TV. The very next day, as Macfarlane pointed out, the prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley, appeared on the same TV.\n\nI thought of something that Jeb Bush said in 2013, after his mother made a statement that was awkward for him, politically: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got a mother.\u201d Everyone has a father, too.\n\n\u2022 President Trump said, \u201cFrankly, if I didn\u2019t become president, we\u2019d be right now in a war with North Korea. You\u2019d be having a war, right now, with North Korea. And by the way, that\u2019s a certainty. That\u2019s not, like, maybe.\u201d\n\nDo you believe that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 President Trump said, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have meetings,\u201d referring to the United States and North Korea. \u201cNobody was going to meet. President Obama wanted to meet, and Chairman Kim would not meet him. The Obama administration was begging for a meeting. They were begging for meetings constantly. And Chairman Kim would not meet with him. And for some reason, we have a certain chemistry or whatever.\u201d\n\nDo you believe that? I mean, not about the chemistry. Do you believe that Obama and his administration \u201cwere begging for meetings constantly\u201d?\n\n\u2022 President Trump said, \u201cYou have a man that was so happy to see me,\u201d referring to Kim Jong-un. \u201cYou have a man that doesn\u2019t smile a lot, but when he saw me, he smiled, he was happy.\u201d\n\nDoes that bode well for the U.S. interest? The realist in me says: beware.\n\n\u2022 President Trump, referring to the Constitution, said, \u201cI have an Article Two, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president.\u201d\n\nIs that your reading of the Constitution as well?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 According to news reports, Dan Coats is on thin ice with his boss, Trump. He may be out on the street, or back home on the farm, by the time my column appears. But Coats has done an excellent, reassuring job as director of national intelligence, including in his latest move.\n\nHe created the position of coordinator for election threats. The first such coordinator will be Shelby Pierson, a career intelligence official. She will be responsible for coordinating the U.S. response to threats against the security of our election process \u2014 threats that come primarily from the Kremlin.\n\nI will miss that old Hoosier politician and statesman, Coats, when he\u2019s gone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Recently, I met a man who enrolled at Harvard in 1956. His major was government. \u201cDid you have Sam Beer?\u201d I asked. Oh, yes. Also, the triumvirate of Huntington, Kissinger, and Brzezinski.\n\nOf Beer \u2014 Professor Samuel Beer \u2014 the man said, \u201cHe told us about the Holocaust. He had pictures and everything. No one had ever heard of it. This was more than a decade after the war.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes \u2014 awareness of the Holocaust crept in slowly, and really got going in the 1960s, as I understand it. Or even later.\n\n\u2022 Do you remember Bruce Laingen? I met him once, in the mid-1990s, and was tickled to do so. He was known to a great many Americans, and he had given an example of grace \u2014 and professionalism \u2014 under pressure: He was the highest-ranking American held hostage in Iran during that ordeal (444 days).\n\nHe has died at 96. To read the New York Times obit, go here.\n\n\u2022 Alan Brinkley, the historian of 20th-century America, has died at 70. (Obit here.) He was a son of David Brinkley, the famed newsman. I have one memory of Professor Brinkley, which I would like to share.\n\nStephen Ambrose had come to discuss his recent biography of Nixon. A student asked him about Nixon and Joe McCarthy, and, in his answer, Ambrose brought up the relationship between RFK and McCarthy. The student protested a bit and looked at Brinkley as if to say, \u201cSay it ain\u2019t so.\u201d Brinkley gave him a look that said, \u201cIt\u2019s so.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2022 Care for a little language? A headline read, \u201cBen Zobrist intends on returning to Cubs this season.\u201d (Article here.) I sort of don\u2019t mind the Americanism \u201cintending on\u201d \u2014 especially in the sports pages.\n\nYou?\n\n\u2022 Speaking of sports \u2014 well, this is sports-related. A couple of weeks ago, New York experienced a heat wave (like a lot of the country). I was talking with a friend of mine \u2014 a female friend \u2014 about how everyone was doing. I almost said, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t look so hot!\u201d\n\nIt did not come out of my mouth. But it almost did, and I told her so \u2014 and related this legendary story:\n\nIt was hot down in spring training. A woman said to Yogi Berra, \u201cWhy, it looks like you\u2019re keeping pretty cool in those pinstripes, Yogi.\u201d He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look so hot yourself, lady.\u201d\n\nBless you, see you.", "description": "A$AP Rocky, Trump, Sweden, democracy, dictatorship, and more.", "authors": ["Jay Nordlinger", "Mairead Mcardle", "Jonah Goldberg", "David French", "Matthew Continetti", "Brian Stewart", "Jack Crowe", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kyle Smith", "Read More"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/AAP-Rocky.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-07-29"}
