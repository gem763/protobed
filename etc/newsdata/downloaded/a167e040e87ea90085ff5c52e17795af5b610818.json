The investment could unlock more financing options for WeWork, which is in talks for a $3 billion to $4 billion loan from a consortium of banks, FT added.\n\nWeWork declined to comment on the report. SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWeWork co-founder Adam Neumann resigned as CEO on Tuesday and gave up the majority of his voting control, after SoftBank - its biggest backer - and other shareholders turned on him over a drop in the U.S. office-sharing start-up's estimated valuation.\n\nSoftBank invested in WeWork parent We Company at a $47 billion valuation in January, but investor scepticism led to a potential IPO valuation of as low as $10 billion earlier this month, Reuters reported.\n\nWe Company has said it is evaluating the \"optimal timing\" for an IPO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Mekhla Raina and Maria Ponnezhath in Bengaluru; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Stephen Coates)", "description": "SoftBank initially planned to invest $1.5 billion in the U.S. office-sharing startup as part of a warrant agreement, giving WeWork the right to receive the money in April next year in exchange for Class A common stock.
