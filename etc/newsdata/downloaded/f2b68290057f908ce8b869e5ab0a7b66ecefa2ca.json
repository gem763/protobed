This isn\u2019t good for Ecuador.\u201d\n\nBig jumps in the costs of gasoline and diesel after Moreno ended subsidies last week set off the upheaval, but other complaints have come out amid the protests, looting, vandalism, clashes with security forces, the blocking of highways and disruptions of Ecuador\u2019s vital oil industry.\n\nMoreno does not appear to be in immediate danger of being ousted, but his political stature is badly shaken. While he has maintained support of the military and other state institutions, his decision to move government operations from Quito to the port of Guayaquil after the turmoil erupted highlighted an image of an administration under siege.\n\nCrucially, Moreno has received statements of support from the Organization of American States and individual Latin American countries that emphasize he took office as Ecuador\u2019s constitutionally elected president in 2017.\n\nStill, the government seems to have been taken aback by the ferocity of the unrest, a miscalculation that undermined its credibility among indigenous groups and others who have long felt marginalized in this nation of 17 million people.\n\nIndigenous protesters are playing a key role in the confrontation with the government, as they have in the past due to their traditional grievances as a minority.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about what might happen,\u201d said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a U.S.-based research group.\n\nHe contrasted Moreno\u2019s decision to cut subsidies while trying to reduce the government\u2019s big debt with the more free-spending policies of his leftist predecessor and former ally, Rafael Correa. \u201cThe big lesson is that it\u2019s very difficult to go from populism to a more orthodox economic policy,\u201d Shifter said.\n\nHe also drew a parallel with Argentina, where conservative President Mauricio Macri has faced a backlash for trying to impose fiscal discipline as the country struggles with low growth, rising poverty and austerity measures after leftist administrations.\n\nAn indigenous leader and four other people have died in Ecuador\u2019s violence since last week, according to the public defender\u2019s office, which monitors human rights. It identified the leader as Inocencio Tucumbi of the Cotopaxi region.\n\nThe president\u2019s office has reported two deaths.\n\nPolice officers were forced to carry the coffin of an indigenous activist during a memorial service at a Quito cultural center being used by indigenous protesters as a base. Earlier, one of eight captive officers was forced to drape a national flag on his shoulders and wear a hat used by some indigenous people. The lone female officer in the group was seen wiping away tears.\n\nAll were forced to remove their boots in front of hundreds of demonstrators, some of whom held white roses in tribute to people who have been killed in the unrest. The officers appeared to be unharmed, and were released late Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith the blood of our brothers, we won\u2019t negotiate,\u201d indigenous leader Jaime Vargas declared in a speech.\n\nHe accused the government, which has floated agricultural aid and other incentives for indigenous groups as a way to resolve the crisis, of deceiving and neglecting Ecuador\u2019s poor.\n\nJos\u00e9 Briones, secretary general of the president\u2019s office, said protesters must release all people \u201ckidnapped\u201d before any dialogue with the government can proceed.\n\nBriones also said order was being restored nationwide and that more than 70% of Ecuador\u2019s cities were peaceful.\n\nProtesters temporarily blocked roads in several parts of Quito on Thursday, but traffic was flowing in many areas following clashes around the capital\u2019s historic center a day earlier.\n\nEcuador\u2019s cuts in fuel subsidies were among measures announced amid a $4.2 billion credit plan with the International Monetary Fund, which says the funds will strengthen the economy and generate jobs.\n\nIndigenous groups condemn the deal with the IMF, saying austerity measures will deepen economic inequality.\n\nMoreno has accused the former president, Correa, of plotting a coup against him with the help of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Both men say the accusation is absurd.\n\nOn Thursday, Correa called for early elections to solve the crisis in Ecuador. He spoke during an interview with The Associated Press in Belgium, where he has lived since leaving office in 2017. He faces an Ecuadorian arrest warrant for alleged corruption that he says is politically motivated.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Christopher Torchia in Rio de Janeiro and Luis Alonso in Washington contributed to this report.", "description": "QUITO, Ecuador (AP) \u2014 Anti-government protesters forced captive police officers to carry a coffin containing the body of an indigenous activist,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/11/8ed9f9_ecuador-political-crisis-34429-indigenous-anti-government-protesters-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
