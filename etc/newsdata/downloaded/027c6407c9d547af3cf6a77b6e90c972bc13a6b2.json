REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas\n\nThe 47-year-old, who retired from international cricket in 2008, filed his nomination for the president\u2019s post of the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) on Monday for the elections to be held on Oct. 23.\n\nSince 2017, the BCCI is being run by administrators appointed by the Supreme Court after its office-bearers failed to implement administrative reforms within the world\u2019s richest national cricket body.\n\nThe Court-appointed administrators will hand over responsibilities once the board members elect the new office bearers during the Oct. 23 elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy I\u2019ll say because it\u2019s a very important time in Indian cricket administration because of all what\u2019s happened in the last three years,\u201d Ganguly told reporters after filing his nomination at the BCCI headquarters.\n\n\u201cTo be a position where I can make a difference along with a team would be extremely satisfying. So hopefully in the next few months we can put everything in place and bring back normalcy in Indian cricket.\u201d\n\nCricket is almost a religion in India. Its star players are the highest-profile athletes and enjoy rockstar status in the world\u2019s second most populous country.\n\nGanguly has the support of most members of the board and could end up as the lone candidate for the president\u2019s post. He would then be elected unopposed.\n\nThe former left-handed batsman, who played 113 tests and 311 one-day internationals and led India to 21 test wins, has already been an administrator for his home state association.\n\nHe was part of the BCCI\u2019s technical panel in the past and also part of a three-member Cricket Advisory Committee, alongside Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman.\n\nGanguly said he had never aspired to be BCCI chief but hoped his experience as a former captain would stand him in good stead.\n\n\u201cWe have lot of things to do, to get the administration in order,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCricket on the field has been brilliant for India, the team has played exceptionally well.\n\n\u201cMy biggest focus will be first-class cricket. I have been very vocal on looking after first-class players because that\u2019s your base, that\u2019s your strength.\u201d\n\nJay Shah, son of Home Minister Amit Shah, filed his nomination to become BCCI secretary.", "description": "Former captain Sourav Ganguly is set to take charge as the head of India's cricket board this month, completing his transition from star player to a top administrator.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440693243&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0VD", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
