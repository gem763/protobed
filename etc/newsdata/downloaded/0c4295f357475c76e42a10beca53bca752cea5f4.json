While power has been restored to much of Grand Bahama, the electrical grid around Abaco's largest city was destroyed, according to the Associated Press.\n\nA senior administration official told CBS News on Wednesday that the Trump administration will not be granting protected status to people fleeing the destruction of the Bahamas.\n\nIt's something the Trump administration had said was a possibility, as the president's White House seeks to restrict the flow of immigrants into the country.\n\n\"The Bahamians impacted by Hurricane Dorian are facing a humanitarian crisis, and the American government, international partners and private organizations continue to support them with aid and services,\" a White House official told CBS News. \"At this time we do not plan to invoke Temporary Protected Status for those currently in the United States.\"\n\nKathryn Watson and Fin Gomez contributed to this report.", "description": "Prime Minister said Dorian impacted the northwest Bahamas' islands for approximately 60 hours, with \"the southern eyewall planted over Grand Bahama for about 30 hours\"", "authors": ["Caroline Linton"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/bf3669b8-6ebd-4b10-acc2-48cb08823c89/thumbnail/1200x630/de1a94fd62b86e45f7f480fdf188a57d/2019-09-11t012550z-2019214400-rc126f7be4f0-rtrmadp-3-storm-dorian.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
