My question would be, why haven\u2019t we done this yet? It\u2019s not controversial any more. We\u2019ve got enough examples now of countries around the world and we can compare and contrast how they have done it. We now have lots more evidence on where it is working well.\u201d\n\nShe said legalisation, which would free up police time, had been supported by prominent former police officers. \u201cThis has been a Lib Dem manifesto commitment for several years, but what brought it to the fore for me was my work with the cross-party commission on serious youth violence. There was clear evidence coming out of it that the more exposure [young people] had to the illicit drugs market, the more likely they were to be exposed to serious violence or know people who were.\n\n\u201cWith resources stretched as well, police don\u2019t want to be diverted into activity on cannabis. If you can regulate and make sure the quality is much safer, it removes the need for police to be looking out for that.\u201d\n\nLegalisation has growing support among MPs. Several Tories now privately say they believe the idea is gaining ground. Benita cited comments from former Metropolitan police chief Bernard Hogan-Howe last year, in which he called for an \u201curgent review\u201d of Britain\u2019s cannabis laws. He said the US had shown how changes could be made in a safe way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not seen clear evidence to say change the law now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have seen clear evidence to say let\u2019s review it, in a time-limited way, not a kicking-into-the-long-grass way. We need to get on with it. We\u2019re lucky \u2013 we\u2019re not the pioneers and we can learn from others\u2019 mistakes. The evidence is out there and it shouldn\u2019t be ignored.\u201d\n\nBenita also called for a \u201cyouth happy hour\u201d to tackle youth crime and violence. It would see venues across London lay on activities for them between 4pm and 6pm.\n\n\u201cWe know there is a problematic time when young people are particularly vulnerable to getting involved in criminal activity or serious violence \u2013 that\u2019s as they leave school,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a mayor that says, \u2018I\u2019d do this if I had the resources\u2019. The message I\u2019m getting is that there are organisations that have the venues and volunteers. There are a lot of public buildings across London that lie empty.\u201d", "description": "Siobhan Benita says the capital should make the move to tackle youth crime", "authors": ["Michael Savage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0440dd0486c6d83f244400a998d8438cf2b3d57a/659_105_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=fd95a3ddd6f023cff78485648efb5876", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
