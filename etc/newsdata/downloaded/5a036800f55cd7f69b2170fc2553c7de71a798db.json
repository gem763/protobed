Processing it is impossible at first. It can\u2019t be your family, your child.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\n\u201cBut having it come back a second time and now a third time is devastating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an aggressive cancer and we knew it would most likely return, but we didn\u2019t think it would be so soon.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Mirror Online revealed how the twins' incredible bond had helped James recover from his first brain tumour.\n\nAged just two he had been diagnosed with an aggressive grade three (cancerous) ependymoma brain tumour .\n\nHis parents were the first to notice something was seriously wrong when RAF engineer Carl, 32, filmed a sweet video of the twins dancing.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nJames was wobbly on his feet but he was only two so his parents weren't worried,\n\nHis symptoms of vomiting, behaviour changes and an aversion to bright lights and certain pitches of sound, were put down to reflux and he was prescribed medication.\n\nBut something was niggling Chantelle and Carl and they knew it was something serious.\n\nThey took him to Lincoln County Hospital\u2019s A&E on February 2 2016, where scans revealed a brain tumour.\n\nAfter an eight-and-a-half-hour operation which removed the whole tumour in February 2016, James endured 56 weeks of chemotherapy, which made his hair fall out and caused painful ulcers.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nHe was left unable to walk for two months and speak for two weeks but slowly recovered with Joshua\u2019s encouragement.\n\nChantelle explained: \"They\u2019d snuggle up in James\u2019 hospital bed and Joshua was so gentle with him.\n\n\"Back at home, he was the first one who got James to climb off the settee to play as he wanted to join in his brother\u2019s fun.\"\n\nBut then the family were told in January last year thatJames' tumour had grown back.\n\nChantelle said: \"We sat the boys down and explained it to them.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\n\u201cThey are very switched on and so we've always found it better to be honest but age appropriate.\u201d\n\nWhen they met with their consultant, James said: \u201cI'm here because I need some help to get this small poorly lump out. I need a man in green to get it for me. A surgeon.\u2019\n\nIn March 2018, James had surgery to remove the 3mm x 3mm tumour and biopsy results confirmed it was the same sort of brain cancer he\u2019d had before.\n\nThen Chantelle and Carl flew out with the boys to Jacksonville, Florida for nine weeks where James had proton beam therapy.\n\nMum Chantelle said: \u201cIt was so daunting at first but the team was amazing. We told him that he has to have some \u2018special medicine\u2019 in America.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\n\u201cBy the end of his time there, James was putting himself to sleep using the \u2018special sleepy medicine\u2019 from the \u2018sleepy doctor.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe youngster tolerated his treatment well but his hair fell out again and he suffered terrible fatigue.\n\nChantelle said: \"As always, James took everything in his stride with a lot of help from Joshua.\n\n\u201cAnd they loved Disney World so we made sure they had fun, too.\u201d\n\nBack at home in July 2018, Chantelle and Carl were overwhelmed with relief when James\u2019 scan showed swelling due to radiation but no evidence of disease.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nBut his three-monthly routine scan in January 2019 revealed he had three new tumours at the front of his brain and a possible tumour at the base of his spine.\n\nChantelle said: \"The boys were with us in the room when the consultant broke the news.\n\n\u201cThey looked at the scan photos with us we explained his poorly lump had come back, along with some friends this time.\n\n\u201cWe were clearly upset but tried to put on a brave face as we explained that we were going to try to help the poorly lumps.\u201d\n\nThis time it was too dangerous to operate due to the tumours\u2019 position so Chantelle and Carl explained James would need more \u201cspecial medicine\u201d \u2013 radiotherapy - which he had at City Hospital, Nottingham.\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nJoshua \u2013 who had a secret language with James when they learned to talk that no-one else could understand - didn\u2019t miss a thing.\n\nChantelle said: \u201cHe asked me how the poorly lumps were going to go away if they couldn\u2019t be cut out.\"\n\nLooking at his innocent little face, Chantelle knew, as always, she had to be honest about his brother.\n\nShe said: \"I had to explain that these poorly lumps might never go away now.\n\n\u201cBut that James\u2019 doctors and nurses would do everything they could to try and keep him and the poorly lumps OK.\u201d\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nJames finished treatment in August and the family have just come back from a week in Disneyland.\n\nChantelle said: \u201cThankfully, he hasn\u2019t suffered too much with sickness, but he\u2019s struggling with his appetite.\n\n\u201cJames is also suffering a lot of fatigue, which is emotionally and physically draining.\n\n\u201cHe finds it hard to play which is tough on Joshua as he misses his best friend and sidekick to play Super Heroes \u2013 James usually Captain America and Joshua Spiderman - and Lego with.\n\n\u201cBut they had lots of giggles in Disneyland and also love snuggling up together watching films and Disney TV shows like PJ Masks and Mickey Mouse .\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\n\u201cAnd Joshua loves helping James with his colouring in.\u201d\n\nSince James\u2019 diagnosis, the family have supported The Brain Tumour Charity\u2019s HeadSmart campaign to raise awareness of children\u2019s brain tumour symptoms and reduce diagnosis time.\n\nThe twins made a video to spearhead the campaign which has halved overall diagnosis time from 13 weeks to 6.5 weeks and aims to reduce this to four weeks or under.\n\nChantelle said: \u201cIt means everything to us to help The Brain Tumour Charity raise awareness.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re blessed with amazing family and friends who give us so much support.\u201d\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nJames uncle, Daniel Spink, ran the Cardiff Half-Marathon on Sundayfor The Brain Tumour Charity, inspired by his brave little nephew he calls Super James.\n\nAnd in July, another uncle, Mark Green, raised over \u00a32,000 for The Brain Tumour Charity when he cycled 310 miles from London to Paris.\n\nJames is due to have a scan this week and will get the results in a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nChantelle said: \"We are hoping that radiation has shrunk the tumours and that James is stable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a waiting game and we take it a day at a time. We\u2019ve always been realistic but we hope for the best and live each day to the full.\u201d\n\n(Image: THE BRAIN TUMOUR CHARITY)\n\nAnd their Super James is their role model.\n\nChantelle said: \u201cJames\u2019 strength and courage keeps us all going.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taught us to make the most of every single day and that it really is the little things in life that matter the most.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re are incredibly proud of both our boys \u2013 they have shown so much courage which inspires us.\n\n\u201cTogether, we are having as much fun as possible and continue to make and cherish memories and special moments as a family.\u201d\n\nSarah Lindsell, The Brain Tumour Charity\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe are incredibly grateful to Carl and Chantelle for sharing their beautiful boy\u2019s story to help us raise awareness about brain tumours \u2013 the biggest cancer killer of children and under-40s.\n\n\u201cJames\u2019 courage is truly astonishing and inspirational and we are all very touched by the bond between him and Joshua.\"\n\nThe Brain Tumour Charity is holding a fundraising midnight walk in Edinurgh on Sunday.
