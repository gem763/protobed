He finally appears to have recovered from the lingering affects of three surgeries to repair the broken leg he suffered last season. McCoy, who has been in Gruden\u2019s system for five years and is a favorite of the head coach, was thought to be leading the race to be the starter during training camp, but issues with the leg arose and held him out until last week.\n\nAD\n\nMcCoy said the leg feels good now, and he\u2019s just trying to trust it and get back into the groove of the game, which includes working with a mostly new set of pass catchers.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten a lot of time with them outside of Paul [Richardson Jr.] and Trey [Quinn], really,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cSo the more I can work with those guys, the more confidence I\u2019ll have. \u2026 Training camp, although it started out well, it went downhill real fast. I think everyone still has some visions of that, especially me. More than anything, it\u2019s just time and figuring out how I\u2019m moving around, how I\u2019m throwing the ball. It\u2019s my plant leg. So far, it\u2019s felt good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Redskins haven\u2019t decided on a starting QB, and frustration is starting to build\n\nThe quarterback uncertainty resurfaced after Keenum, who was limited during Thursday\u2019s practice with a foot injury, struggled mightily the past two weeks. He threw three interceptions and sprained his foot in a 31-15 loss to the Chicago Bears on \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d then got off to a horrible start in a 24-3 loss to the Giants, missing two wide-open deep passes and throwing an interception. Haskins entered in the second quarter against the Giants but struggled, completing 9 of 17 passes with three interceptions and seemingly proving the coaching staff correct in thinking he wasn\u2019t ready to start.\n\nAD\n\nGruden declined to specify how the reps were divided during Thursday\u2019s practice.\n\nWhichever passer gets the starting nod runs the risk of playing with an offensive unit decimated by injuries. Guard Brandon Scherff (ankle), tight ends Vernon Davis (concussion) and Jordan Reed (concussion) were held out of practice Thursday, while center Chase Roullier (knee) and wide receiver Terry McLaurin (hamstring) were limited. Gruden said they being extra cautious with McLaurin, who starred in his first three games as a rookie, because hamstring injuries can linger. He said Friday\u2019s practice will be a significant one as it pertains to determining McLaurin\u2019s availability.\n\nAD\n\nWashington will be going up against a New England defense that is allowing fewer than seven points per game and is on pace to set NFL records for sacks and interceptions. Things don\u2019t figure to be any easier on the other side of the ball, and the defense has a pair of banged-up players in cornerback Josh Norman (knee) and Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring) ahead of the matchup with Brady.\n\nAD\n\nNorman, who landed awkwardly on his knee against the Giants, said there\u2019s nothing structurally wrong.\n\n\u201cStill working out the soreness,\u201d Norman said. \u201cTaking it day by day. [The Patriots] are a special group. Because what they do, they don\u2019t change. And they\u2019re really good at it. \u2026 [Brady] is so efficient. He\u2019s the best of the best.\u201d\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nThe Redskins would be a lot of fun if they were as good as Bill Belichick says they are\n\nFive Redskins bright spots on a humiliatingly bad team\n\n\u2018Coaching malpractice\u2019: Analysts rip Jay Gruden for playing Dwayne Haskins against Giants\n\nAD", "description": "Colt McCoy appears to be fully recovered from the broken leg he suffered last year, although the rest of the team's offense is dealing with injury issues.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZhumPni4BWkOLxJSLjmbFQ3NMJ4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LTD35IG3GMI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg"}
