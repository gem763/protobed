I don\u2019t think about it like that, I\u2019m not a negative person,\u201d said Asher-Smith, who ran 22.32 seconds in her 200m heat.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just proud of myself, I\u2019ve definitely taken my time and worked my way up from being a relay runner and then through Beijing through London and the broken foot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a lot of hard work that I\u2019m proud. We\u2019ve got more goals to go through the week. I\u2019ve never really got nervous, not since 2013 but I definitely get adrenaline which is good.\n\n\u201cThat means it\u2019s all within my control. But no I wasn\u2019t nervous because I knew that I had it within me.\u201d\n\nBeth Dobbin also reached the semi-finals after coming third in heat six in 23.14secs.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s my first worlds. This time two years ago, if you\u2019d said I was coming I\u2019d have laughed in your face. It\u2019s a new experience for me. This is the longest I\u2019ve ever been away from home. There are loads of first times.\n\n\u201cMy coach isn\u2019t here which has been tough, as well as dealing with injuries. It\u2019s been tricky but I\u2019m through to the semis.\u201d\n\nIn the men\u2019s 200m Gemili reached Tuesday night\u2019s final at the Khalifa International Stadium.\n\nGemili ran a season\u2019s best of 20.03s and told the BBC: \u201cMy coach said \u2018win the semi, get a good lane and once you are in the final you have a chance of medalling\u2019.\n\n\u201cI feel good, I feel fit and healthy, so no complaints. I don\u2019t think I have quite lived up to what people expected and I am just trying to run my best.\u201d\n\nZharnel Hughes failed to progress and Miguel Francis was forced to pull out after suffering a quad strain in Sunday\u2019s heats.\n\nHughes, who came sixth in the 100m final, added: \u201cI try not to dwell too much in disappointment \u2013 as an athlete you will feel some over the years and it\u2019s hard.\n\n\u201cSometimes it can be a heavy pill to swallow, but at the end of the day you have to recover yourself and try not to get too consumed in disappointment.\u201d\n\nLaviai Nielsen reached the 400m semi-finals with a run of 51.52s but Emily Diamond missed out, while Andrew Pozzi also reached the 110m hurdles semi-finals in 13.53s.\n\nPA", "description": "Dina Asher-Smith\u2019s chances of World Athletics Championships gold continued to grow after a raft of rivals pulled out of the 200m \u2013 as Adam Gemili kept his medal hopes alive.
