Her father Phil B. Colson is a musician who played with bands like Foreday Riders, Rum Jungle and Mount Lofty Ranger. Her mother, Loene Furler, was a singer-songwriter, musician and art teacher.\n\nSia began her career as a singer for a Jazz band called Crisp. She was featured on both albums \u2018Word and the Deal\u2019 and \u2018Delerium\u2019. In 2000, Sia moved to London to embark on her solo career and signed her first record label with Sony Music Label. She released a second solo album called \u201cHealing is Difficult\u201d, which was a mixture of R&B and Jazz.\n\nDuring her success as a solo artist, Sia also wrote songs for other singers like Beyonce, Britney Spears, and Katy Perry. She had a hard time adjusting to newfound fame and keeps her personal life out of the spotlight, which is why she regularly conceals her face underneath cropped wigs and big bows.\n\nDuring her interview with the New York Times in 2014, she was asked the question about why she wears a wig, she said: \u201cI just wanted to have a private life.\u201d In 2015, Sia was nominated for four categories in the Grammy: Best performance of Solo Pop, Recording of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Music Video.\n\nWhat is Ehlers- Danlos syndrome?\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Health (NIH), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissue supporting the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many more organs and tissues.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS). Many of them are rare, but the most common types of EDS are Hypermobile EDS, Classical EDS, Vascular EDS, and Kyphoscholiotic EDS.\n\nAs of now, there are no specific treatments for EDS but it is possible to manage the symptoms of these chronic diseases with proper support and advice from specialists. It's important for people who have EDS to be careful about certain activities that put a lot of strain on the joints. Swimming and Pilates are some of the best-recommended exercises to maintain a fit and healthy lifestyle.\n\nSia struggle with mental health and EDS\n\nDuring Sia's interview with Billboard in 2013, she revealed that in the year 2010, after contemplating suicide she began a 12-step program to better herself. \u201cI got seriously addicted to Vicodin and Oxycodone, and I was always drinking but I didn\u2019t know I was an alcoholic.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, during her interview with the New York Times, she said \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a different place every day there\u2019s this kind of madness that sets in.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get away with getting high because everybody\u2019s drinking on the road. None of my friends thought I was alcoholic and neither did I.\u201d\n\nOn 11th September 2018, Sia tweeted on her official twitter account \u201cEight years sober today. I love you, keep going. You can do it\u201d.\n\nOne year later on 5th October 2019, she discussed her experience with EDS, \u201cHey, I\u2019m suffering from chronic pain, a neurological disease, Ehlers-Danlos and I just wanted to say to those of you suffering from pain, whether physical or emotional.\n\nI love you, keep going. Life is hard. Pain is demoralizing, and you\u2019re not alone\u201d.", "description": "The Australian singer/songwriter recently opened upon her battle with a chronic disease called 'Ehlers-Danlos syndrome'.", "authors": ["Music Crowns", "Read More On The Same Topic Galila Rafaat", "Selena Gomez Wrote An Essay For Time On The 'Immigration Crisis In United States'", "Billie Eilish", "Discussed How Her World Tour Will Be Eco-Friendly", "Mike Mendel Television Producer For 'The Simpsons'", "'Rick", "Morty' Dies At"], "top_image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2019/10/5/os/b_1200x630/boston-calling-day-one-sia-and-sufjan-stevens-photos-c-2016-by-scott-murry-image-credit-digboston-flickr_2335133.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
