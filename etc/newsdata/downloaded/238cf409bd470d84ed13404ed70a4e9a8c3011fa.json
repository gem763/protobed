We have a big surprise for their BIG family this morning! https://t.co/W1vUNMab63 pic.twitter.com/yUY1FphM1u \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) October 11, 2019\n\nKeith recalled, \u201cChild protective services says, hey Keith, we got this sibling group of four sitting in our office. We\u2019ve tried all day to find a home for these kids. Could you just take them for a weekend?\u201d\n\nThat evening, Keith and Staci met Koby, Kylie, Bailey and Emmy.\n\n\u201cI sort of thought if we didn\u2019t come here, then we might be separated,\u201d said 16-year-old Koby.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue in foster care that many children face: being separated from their siblings and being placed in different homes sometimes to never see each other again.\n\nABC News\n\n\u201cA lot of families don\u2019t have the space,\u201d said Keith. \u201cNot only were they losing their mom or their dad because of circumstances that they didn\u2019t create they were now re-traumatized or re-victimized because they are separated from their siblings. The person that you should have the longest relationship in your life - with your sibling.\u201d\n\nRunning the shelter, Keith knew if he didn't take the four siblings in, it would impact them forever.\n\n\"If they didn't go into the shelter they would've gone into two, three, maybe four homes and I don't know if they would have ever been back together,\" said Staci.\n\nMonths later, they decided to foster and eventually adopt all four siblings. They were already parents to two children of their own, but wanted to give Koby, Kylie, Bailey and Emmy a forever home.\n\nABC News\n\n\"We want these kids to thrive,\" said Keith. \"Just grow into their personalities, into their potential that they have.\"\n\nKeith is president and CEO of Circle of Care. By his estimate, the organization has raised $4 million to build homes for families willing to take sibling sets. The charity hopes it will make it easier for people to help.\n\nKeith's work has left a lasting impact on families and many foster siblings.\n\n\"GMA\" was so touched by Keith's work and how he's left a lasting impact on families and many foster siblings, that they surprised his family with a Disney River Cruise.\n\nABCNews.com\n\nStaci said she and Keith couldn't imagined their lives without the kids.\n\n\"They have brought such a blessing to our family,\" she told \"GMA.\" \"They have filled our home with so much love and so much joy.\"\n\nAs for advice to people considering fostering or adopted, Keith said to \"just do it.\"\n\n\"There's kids living this hard reality every day and so we need good people, strong people to step up and give safe homes, safe families and lots of love to these kids,\" he told \"GMA.\"", "description": "Keith and Staci Howard run a non-profit called Circle of Care which helps adoptive families keep foster sibling sets.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/191011_gma_breakfast1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
