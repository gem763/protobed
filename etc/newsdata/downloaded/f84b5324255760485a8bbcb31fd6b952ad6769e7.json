For now, what the universe has delivered is very much in the spirit of a \u201cchosen family\u201d.\u2019\n\nIncluded in that \u2018chosen family\u2019 is South Sudanese model Adut Akech, who has become one of Naomi\u2019s proteges.\n\nIn the past year, Naomi has been romantically linked to the likes of Skepta and Liam Payne, the latter of whom she was rumoured to have dated earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair never confirmed their relationship and Naomi appears to have been single ever since.\n\nNaomi\u2019s busy being a queen (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nAddressing her dating life, the British model said: \u2018For me, privacy is important to know each other, and I always worry that my job will not allow that.\u2019\n\nRecalling advice given to her by an a-list friend, Naomi added: \u2018But I have ways. I was taught that by Robert De Niro. Being alone doesn\u2019t mean you are lonely. I don\u2019t have time to be bored, and I don\u2019t have time to be lonely.\u2019\n\nPreach it.\n\nThe model\u2019s fast-paced lifestyle and charity work was praised by British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful, who told the magazine: \u2018If Naomi wasn\u2019t modeling, she could run a small country.\n\n\u2018She has that thing, like most black people in any industry: You have to fight twice as hard. She\u2019s always been fighting, but now even more.\u2019\n\nNaomi\u2019s certainly been a busy lady recently. The fashion muse hosted another year of her Fashion For Relief charity show during London Fashion Week, to fight against poverty and disadvantaged people around the world, raising millions in donations over the past 14 years.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
