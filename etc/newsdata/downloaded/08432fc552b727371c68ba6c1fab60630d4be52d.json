Have you secretly wondered what the worst thing about menstruation is? (It\u2019s okay if you have.) Perhaps it\u2019s the cramps. Perhaps it\u2019s the mess. Perhaps it\u2019s all those wacky hormones.\n\nBut no, it\u2019s none of those things, as Always, a sanitary-products company, has discovered. Apparently, the worst thing about periods is that only women get them. . . . Seriously. Periods are not sufficiently inclusive.\n\nPer CNN:\n\nAlways sanitary products will remove the Venus symbol, historically used to represent the female sex, from its products to be inclusive of transgender and nonbinary customers. Transgender activists and allies had publicly urged Proctor & Gamble to redesign its pad wrapper without the gender symbol, a circle atop a cross. . .\n\nPer a trans activist:\n\ntw// periods hi @Always i understand that you guys love girl positivity but please understand that there are trans men that get periods, and if you could please do something about the \u2640\ufe0fsymbol on your pad packaging, i\u2019d be happy. i\u2019d hate to have any trans males feel dysphoric. \u2014 jocelyn \u2730 (@phiddies) October 13, 2019\n\nAnd per Proctor & Gamble:\n\nFor over 35 years Always has championed girls and women, and we will continue to do so . . . We\u2019re also committed to diversity & inclusion and are on a continual journey to understand the needs of all of our consumers.\n\nPeriods, eh. Too much information? No, sir. Too much insanity.", "description": "Apparently, the worst thing about periods is that only women get them. . . . Seriously.", "authors": ["Madeleine Kearns", "Robert Verbruggen", "Andrew C.
