And you\u2019d better believe I followed his channel as soon as I saw it existed.\n\nThe channel\u2019s been verified, so I gotta assume it was set up by someone from the President\u2019s actual team. (I\u2019ll keep saying \u201che\u2019s streaming,\u201d even though I\u2019m pretty sure Trump is not handling the tech himself.) As yet, all he\u2019s streamed is a rally in Minneapolis. His channel had only 135 followers last night, according to The Verge, but at the time of this writing it\u2019s got almost 50,000.\n\nI gotta admit, that peaks my curiosity. It\u2019d be like your most graceless family member entering a ballet competition \u2014 you have no idea what they\u2019re doing there, and you feel like you need to keep an eye on them. So yeah, I followed the President on Twitch because I gotta see what he does with this.\n\nI dare not surmise what political purpose a Twitch channel plays. Maybe it\u2019s an attempt to harness the youthful demographic who\u2019ve replaced most other forms of entertainment with game streaming? Good luck tearing those kids away from Fortnite streams long enough to pay attention.\n\nAlso, you may have heard this, but Trump has some animosity towards Amazon \u2014 or at least owner Jeff Bezos. He\u2019s hardly alone in that, but I wonder if anyone told him Amazon literally owns Twitch. Then again, Bernie Sanders also has a history of publicly calling out the Big A and he\u2019s also got a channel on Twitch, so I guess it\u2019s not actually that big of a deal. One of his staff members told The Verge it was to tap a \u201cpotentially supportive audience that we may not be hitting other ways,\u201d which sounds like it supports the aforementioned Fortnite generation hypothesis.\n\nSo basically, it\u2019s the How Do You Do, Fellow Kids meme. I\u2019m cool with that.\n\nThat said, if you do go there, I highly recommend keeping the chat turned off. I dipped in when the channel was offline and was treated to a cavalcade of spam \u2014 most of it not even relevant to the President\u2019s politics. If there\u2019s one thing more annoying than chat spam, it\u2019s off-topic chat spam. I can only guess it\u2019ll get worse once he\u2019s online again.\n\nIf nothing else, it\u2019s going to be incredibly bizarre to read the notification \u201cDonaldTrump has started streaming.\u201d\n\nRead next: Why migrating to another planet is a stupid and implausible idea", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FDonald-Trump-Twitch.jpg&signature=9ce58bbdde5fb56f0d69497f733c2788", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
