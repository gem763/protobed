His announcement was condemned by the Palestinians, Arab countries, the UN, and the EU.\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry said on Wednesday that Netanyahu\u2019s move could \u201clead to a sharp escalation of tension in the region and undermine hopes for the establishment of a long-awaited peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours\u201d. The Kremlin has not yet commented on Netanyahu\u2019s statement.\n\nToday\u2019s meeting in Sochi, on Russia\u2019s Black Sea coastline, is the third meeting between Netanyahu and Putin this year. They also held talks ahead of Israeli elections in April. The two leaders have met over a dozen times since 2015.\n\nNetanyahu and Putin are also set to discuss the conflict in Syria. Russia has backed Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, while Israel has conducted hundreds of strikes in Syria, most of them against what it says are Iranian and Hezbollah targets. Both Iran and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shia group, support Assad.\n\nNetanyahu told Russia\u2019s RBC media outlet that his good relationship with Putin had helped avert \u201ca near-unavoidable clash\u201d between the Israeli and Russian militaries in Syria. The two countries signed a deal in 2015 to coordinate military actions over Syria in order to avoid accidentally trading fire.\n\nRussian media reports said this week that Russian Su-35 fighter jets prevented Israeli warplanes from carrying out airstrikes on southern Syria. The incident came after Iranian-backed forces were reported to have launched a rocket attack on Israel.\n\nPutin is due to meet the Iranian president, Hassan Rohani, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Ankara next week to discuss the Syria conflict. Russia last month offered to help Iran dodge US sanctions by allowing Tehran to transport crude oil through its ports in Crimea, which Russia seized from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nNetanyahu sought to dissuade Russia from closer ties with Iran, telling RBC that Tehran posed a threat not only to Israel and the west, but also to Moscow.\n\nNetanayhu\u2019s visit to Russia was interpreted back home as a last-minute attempt to win over Russia-speaking Israelis in next Tuesday\u2019s election. The prime minister has launched an aggressive campaign to woo the minority of one million people, running ads in Russian and erecting a giant poster of him and Putin on his Likud party\u2019s Tel Aviv headquarters.\n\nThe leader wants to steal voters from his ally-turned-rival, Avigdor Lieberman, himself an immigrant from the Soviet Union. He is widely predicted to win enough seats to become Israel\u2019s kingmaker next week, and possibly end Netanyahu\u2019s 13-year career in high office.\n\nLieberman, a hardline secular ultranationalist, has slammed Netanyahu as weak on security and for making deals with religious parties. The 61-year-old former defence minister\u2019s refused to join Likud\u2019s previous coalition in May, shattering Netanyahu\u2019s attempts to form a government. Now a repeat poll will be held on 17 September, less than six months since the last general election.", "description": "Moscow says proposal could increase regional tensions, as Israeli PM meets Putin", "authors": ["Marc Bennetts", "Oliver Holmes", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97dec4da582dd61e6c07685c6e08488d7e4579e/0_124_4699_2820/master/4699.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=94fb0c7ec05b58d1affc33b6267ddf99", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
