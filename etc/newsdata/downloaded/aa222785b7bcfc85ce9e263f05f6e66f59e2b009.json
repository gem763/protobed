This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device.\n\nNSO Group said it would fight the allegations.\n\n\"In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,\" the company said in a statement to the BBC.\n\n\"The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.\"", "description": "Facebook-owned WhatsApp alleges NSO Group was behind a cyber-attack on phones and messages.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/511D/production/_109456702_gettyimages-630348510.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
