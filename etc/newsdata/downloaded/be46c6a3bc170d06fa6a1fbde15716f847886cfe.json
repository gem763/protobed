Sure, we\u2019ve settled for our 2-in-1 hair and body washes, irritating deodorants and questionable beard conditioners, but most of us have grown tired of hiding the fact that yes, we could use a little help too.\n\nIt seems the world has woken up to the fact that men want more and the big business that means, with grooming the fastest growing section of the cosmetics industry this year \u2013 soon to be worth over \u00a323 billion by 2024.\n\nWe are all realising that self-care is important and that there are only benefits from dipping our fingers into the many grooming goodies now on offer.\n\nNot that we will settle for anything; we\u2019re an impatient bunch, barely giving a product one skin cycle (28 days, if you were wondering) before deciding whether or not it has a permanent place in our bathroom cabinets. We want efficacy, we want efficiency and we want extraordinary results.\n\nAfter months (years, really) of testing a range of products on the market, these are the skincare buys that hold pride of place in our grooming bags. Trust us \u2013 you won\u2019t be disappointed.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nOrveda the healing sap: \u00a3125, Harvey Nichols\n\nA serum-essence hybrid and the most efficacious product in this list, Orveda\u2019s healing sap is a godsend for all skin types. It is literally like taking a shot of chlorophyll for your face, which is no surprise as the formula derives its actives from nature. The unique mix of 10 potent ingredients work to brighten, hydrate, heal and tone for a complexion that ends up pretty damn perfect. It is the ultimate multitasking maverick.\n\nBuy now\n\nCeraVe SA smoothing cleanser: \u00a312, Look Fantastic\n\nA good cleanser should be many things, but first and foremost should be able to wash away the dirt and debris of the day (or night). CeraVe\u2019s newest cleanser up\u2019s the ante with salicylic acid, an oil-dissolving acid that can remove pore-clogging impurities such as sebum and pollution to clear congested skin. To make the most out of the actives, which also includes CeraVe\u2019s signature ceramides (barrier restoring lipids), massage it into the face for a good minute.\n\nBuy now\n\nDr Michael Prager urban protect acid peel mask with AHA\u2019s: \u00a3141.67, Net-A-Porter\n\nMen have thicker skin than women, which explains why we age a little slower. The downside is that we have more overzealous oil glands, meaning we are more prone to congestion and built-up dead cells. Sort it out with a great exfoliator, like Dr Prager\u2019s, which has all the big boys of the acid world in it \u2013 lactic, mandelic, glycolic & salicylic. The cooling gel will slough away skin to keep you fresh faced and feeling like you\u2019ve gone for a facial in Dr Prager\u2019s sleek clinic (highly recommended, FYI).\n\nBuy now\n\nLa Mer the replenishing oil exfoliator: \u00a385, John Lewis & Partners\n\nIf acids make you nervous, stick with a scrub. While many can be irritating (stay away from any walnut, please) there are a few on the market that are gentle enough to not cause micro-tears but strong enough to have you touching your smooth skin all day (note: don\u2019t!). La Mer\u2019s scrub feels so luxurious you will want to leave it on your face, which is totally acceptable considering the oil it is suspended in is filled with the brands iconic miracle broth.\n\nBuy now\n\nAesop parsley seed anti-oxidant facial toner: \u00a345, Mr Porter\n\nIf you like a mimosa, you\u2019ll love this. It is refreshing, light (and goes down just as quickly) perking up your face with antioxidants and priming it with hydrating. While most toners are normally full of alcohol, the ever-considered Aesop has taken the difficult ingredient out, focusing instead on its philosophy of natural and efficacious formulas. Use this before a cleanser but prior to any serums.\n\nBuy now\n\n111SKIN bio cellulose facial treatment mask: \u00a320, 111SKIN\n\nBirthday party? Business meeting? Big event? Throw a face mask on beforehand. Nothing forces active ingredients deep within the dermis like a great sheet mask, thanks to its bio cellulose body (500x finer than tissue and commonly used to treat wounds) which acts almost like a second skin. Leave it on for a good 15 minutes then pat on any extra essence still in the bag. Hydration heaven.\n\nBuy now\n\niS clinical super serum advance: \u00a372, Victoria Health\n\nAnother strong multitasker that deals with everything from fine lines, wrinkles, pigmentation, collagen production and free-radical protection, iS Clinical\u2019s super serum is aptly named. A 15 per cent concentration of vitamin C would traditionally sensitise your skin, but the stable formula and pairing with copper peptides and botanical antioxidants mitigates all that irritation. Definitely worth the investment.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe Inky List caffeine serum: \u00a38.99, Cult Beauty\n\nCoffee is used to wake you up in the morning so why not use it on your eyes too? At least that was the thought process behind the scientist who started testing caffeine against the skin and (no surprise) found out it was as effective topically as it is to drink. Loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, this serum is one of the few that can actually lessen dark circles while alleviating puffiness and water retention (coffee is a diuretic, after all). We\u2019ll take a double shot, thank you.\n\nBuy now\n\nMarie Reynolds face night oil: \u00a337.99, Marie Reynolds\n\nThere is a reason Marie Reynolds, who operates her energy healing and master-lift facials from Fortnum & Mason, is referred to as \u201cthe witch of the West End\u201d. She\u2019s absolutely magic, a magic that has now been meticulously filtered into her brand\u2019s skincare range. One of the latest highlights includes a dry oil that is packed with natural actives, including a slow release vitamin A that doesn\u2019t cause the inflammation you see from other retinol products. We\u2019re totally enchanted.\n\nBuy now\n\nAugustinus Bader the cream: \u00a3125, Augustinus Bader\u200b\n\nThere is a reason this cream is a desert island must-have for grooming editor\u2019s everywhere; it just works. Using his years of experience in stem cell research and wound healing, professor Augustinus Bader formulated this cream to kickstart dormant stem cells for an instantly more youthful, brighter, clearer complexion. Get involved.\n\nBuy now\n\nVotary body treatment oil: \u00a355, Space NK\n\nThe face comes first, but we have to look after our bodies too. Formulated to deal with rough skin, unsightly bumps and even spots (thank you, salicylic acid), Votary\u2019s body treatment oil will you have you beach (or bedroom) ready after a few goes.\n\nBuy now\n\nTom Ford bronzing gel: \u00a339, Tom Ford\n\nBronzing powder is frustrating \u2013 you need a brush and sometimes it just sits on the skin, visible to the world. A good gel is sheer, lightweight and totally invisible to the naked eye on the face, giving you a sunkissed, natural glow. Smother this Tom Ford one (which has been a cult classic for quite a while) all over to look like you\u2019ve been on the best holiday, or simply apply it above the beard line, at the top of the forehead, under the jaw and along the nose to give your face a touch of definition. It\u2019s healthy looking skin in a bottle.\n\nBuy now\n\nClinique aloe shave gel: \u00a316, Clinique\n\nAloe vera is cooling, soothing, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial, so it is no shock that Clinique has cleverly made it the base ingredient in its shaving gel. It makes for a beautiful, smooth shave, softens any facial hair and infuses the skin with the hydrating properties that aloe vera also has.\n\nBuy now\n\nSisley confort extreme hand cream: \u00a345.95, All Beauty\n\nHands are (believe it or not) one of the first things people notice on a man \u2013 after all, the moment we meet someone we shake their hands. That is why a great hand product is so important. If you are after one that gives you a silk glove of nutrition, moisture and protection then look no further than Sisley\u2019s buttery cream. Despite the ultra-soft texture, the formula absorbs instantly, is non-greasy and will leave you wanting to shake everyone\u2019s hand (just to show off).\n\nBuy now\n\nMauli Rituals grow strong hair oil: \u00a332, Mauli Rituals\n\nA solid hair and beard oil is a man\u2019s secret weapon. Hear us out \u2013 your beard will be soft (which your partner will appreciate), your hair will remain thick (clinical studies link using botanical oils on your scalp to healthy hair follicles) and you\u2019ll have the sheen of a freshly groomed retriever. The Mauli Rituals oil takes it one step further, using ayurvedic ingredients that have 2000+ years of research behind them to stimulate hair growth and nourish strands. Now go fetch!\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Men\u2019s skincare\n\nStrong, soothing and sustainable, Orveda\u2019s healing sap is a state-of-the-art answer to great skincare. The potent formula is as versatile as they come, addressing all concerns and conditions without compromise while the aqueous texture is so luxurious you\u2019ll want to swim in it. If you can afford it, please do.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
