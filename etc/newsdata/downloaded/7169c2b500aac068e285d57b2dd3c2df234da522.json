The idea of making a washable wool shoe was revolutionary, and now they\u2019re going one step further. The Mizzle collection for men and women is the brand\u2019s first foray into weather-resistant shoes that don\u2019t lean on the use of synthetic materials or chemicals to do their job.\n\nThe new collection features the iconic Wool Runner and brand new shape, the Wool Runner-Up, made from a thick layer of ZQ-certified Merino Wool (ZQ is one of the world\u2019s top ethical suppliers of wool). In addition to the wool, each shoe features Puddle Guard, a combination of a thin, water-repellent membrane and a fluorine-free DWR coating to help rain bead up and roll off. The brand has also added a reinforced SweetFoam sole with traction to keep you from slipping and sliding in the rain. The Mizzle Wool Runner will be your go-to when there\u2019s rain in the forecast but you want to stay true to your style. Go one step further with the Mizzle Runner-Up, which is a new take on a rain boot and a far cry from the bulky boots we all rely on. There\u2019s so much to love about Allbirds shoes and the addition of the Mizzle collection means you can wear your favorite shoes, rain or shine. | Shop at Allbirds >\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
