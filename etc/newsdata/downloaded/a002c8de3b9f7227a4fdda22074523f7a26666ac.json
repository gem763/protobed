The idea is for people to invite a group of friends to an activity that they would do together. The packages often come with perks\u2014free drinks or entry into a club, for example. In return, the sellers earn rewards that can go toward funding their own trips or other perks in the future.\n\nPollen takes an 18% commission on sales it delivers, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nPollen has 35,000 members who have used the service at least once in the past 12 months, according to Callum Negus-Fancey, the company\u2019s co-founder. Users have sold more than 330,000 experiences since the beginning of the year, the company said.\n\n\u201cWhat we are really doing is helping [marketer clients] design the rewards program and getting it onto our platform,\u201d said Mr. Negus-Fancey. \u201cOver years and years of doing this, we have collected lots of data on what type of rewards work and why.\u201d\n\nPollen clients outside music and travel so far include BMW AG\u2019s BMW Performance Center driving schools and the Jacksonville Jaguars football team. Pollen works with more than 500 partners, the company said.\n\nMarketers are looking for ways to win consumers beyond traditional advertising. Even influencer marketing is losing its appeal for some brands, which are enlisting real customers to praise them instead.\n\n\u201cMarketers have lost a certain amount of trust because they are shouting from the rooftops so loudly that people don\u2019t know if what they are shouting is true versus hyperbole,\u201d said Scott Kellner, vice president of marketing at George P. Johnson, which works on so-called experiential marketing campaigns for clients such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV\u2019s Jeep.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to value other people like them who are making recommendations, as opposed to trusting corporate messaging,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Pollen\u2019s roots are in music festivals and concerts, travel now accounts for a majority of the company\u2019s revenue, according to Gareth Jefferies, investment manager at Northzone, the lead investor in Pollen\u2019s funding round. The new funds will fuel the company\u2019s effort to expand into categories including restaurants, fitness, live sports events and others that make sense for groups.\n\n\u201cExperiences don\u2019t have to be ticketed events; you could be planning your birthday and you know 20 people are coming\u2014that\u2019s a great table for a restaurant, who might offer a private dining room or free bottles of champagne,\u201d said Mr. Jefferies.\n\nMr. Jefferies said Northzone was drawn in part to Pollen because of its ability to reach younger consumers. A vast majority of Pollen\u2019s members are between the ages of 18 and 25, a hard-to-reach demographic that values word-of-mouth recommendations, he said.\n\nPollen generates tens of millions of dollars in revenue each year, Mr. Negus-Fancey said, declining to be more specific. Revenue for this year is on track to be up 250% versus last year, he said.\n\nThe new investment round gives the company a valuation 375% higher than it had in the prior funding round in October 2017, he added.\n\nOther backers participating in the round included Sienna Capital and existing investors Draper Esprit, Backed and Kindred Ventures. Pollen has raised $100 million to date.\n\nAs part of the funding, Pollen acquired a company called Lifestylez, which sells custom ski and snowboard group tours for college students in North America and Switzerland, for $10 million including earnouts, cash and stock, the company said.\n\n\u201cThe key part of the vision is having all of the best experiences on one platform,\u201d said Mr. Negus-Fancey.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com", "description": "Events marketing company Pollen, whose platform encourages people to promote group experiences to their friends, has raised $60 million to continue its expansion into categories beyond music and travel.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120056/social", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
