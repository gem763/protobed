Uber customers tip on just 16% of rides, the paper concluded after analyzing 40 million rides. However, the average tip is $3.11, or approximately one quarter of their fare.\n\nHere\u2019s what else he found:\n\n\u2022 Some 60% of ride-share customers never tip, while only 1% always tip.\n\n\u2022 Men tip on 17% of trips, while women tip on 14.3% of trips.\n\n\u2022 Women drivers are tipped up to 12% more than male drivers.\n\n\u2022 But men and women drivers aged 65 and over are tipped at the same rate.\n\n\u2022 Uber customers tip better from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., and on Fridays and Saturdays at 6 p.m.\n\n\u2022 Riders with 5-star ratings tip more than twice as often as those with 4.75-star ratings.\n\nThe paper examined UberX trips from Aug. 18, 2017 to Sept. 14, 2017, and analysis was restricted to six cities: Chicago, Boston and San Francisco (as three large cities in different regions); Salt Lake City and Asheville, N.C.; as well as college town Bloomington, Ind.\n\nUber customers tip on just 16% of rides, he concluded, after analyzing 40 million rides. However, the average tip is $3.11, approximately one quarter of their fare.\n\n\u201cField experiments provide an empirical look at consumer behavior that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise,\u201d said List, the Kenneth C. Griffin Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at UChicago. \u201cIn this case, we found clear differences in tipping behavior informed by environmental and demographic factors, such as gender, age and race.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn addition, we were able to go beyond simple measurement and answer the \u2018whys\u2019 behind tipping,\u201d he added, according to a statement provided by the University of Chicago. \u201cIn so doing, we can provide a unique glimpse of social preferences in the field and provide insights into how norms and defaults work in tandem to change behaviors.\u201d\n\nThe paper was co-authored by economist Uri Gneezy of the University of California, San Diego; UChicago alumni Bharat Chandar, currently a doctoral student at Stanford University; and Ian Muir, who now works at Lyft LYFT, -1.34%, and is a former Uber UBER, -0.48% employee who still retains equity in that company.\n\n\u201cEven though social preferences affect nearly every facet of life, there exist many open questions on the economics of social preferences in markets,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe leverage a unique opportunity to generate a large data set to inform the who\u2019s, what\u2019s, where\u2019s, and when\u2019s of social preferences through the lens of a nationwide tipping field experiment on the Uber platform.\u201d\n\nAlso see: Is this the worst tipper in America?\n\nPrevious research suggests that older customers are often the most generous tippers, especially when it comes to ride-share services. \u201cGive as if you were taking,\u201d Hisham Matar, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of the memoir \u201cThe Return,\u201d said his late father advised him. But not everyone follows that rule when dealing with members of the service industry, according to separate research.\n\nMore than half of Americans aged 65 and over tip 20% or more at restaurants, the highest of any age group, the survey released Thursday by CreditCards.com found. Women are better tippers than men and baby boomers are more generous tippers than millennials, according to the survey.\n\nGovernment data concluding that women are paid 83 cents on the dollar compared to men might suggest that men would tip more rather than less. But that\u2019s not the case.\n\nBaby boomers are more likely than millennials to tip restaurant servers and taxi or ride-share drivers (63% versus 40%), hair stylists (73% versus 53%), food delivery (72% versus 56%) and hotel housekeepers (33% versus 23%).\n\nWhy the differences? \u201cConventional wisdom says that if you have more money, you tip more,\u201d said Ted Rossman, an industry analyst at CreditCards.com. \u201cSo maybe boomers have saved more money, or they have higher salaries if they\u2019re still working.\u201d\n\nFor many people, tipping is a source of anxiety. \u201cAlmost everyone knows that it\u2019s customary to tip at a restaurant,\u201d Rossman added. \u201cI don\u2019t think most people know that it\u2019s also expected with a hotel housekeeper and a barista.\u201d Or, for that matter, the person who washes your hair.\n\nCase in point: More than half of U.S. adults (53%) said they give their kids\u2019 teachers or child-care providers holiday tips at least on occasion. But a majority of people said they never give their trash/recycling collectors or mail carriers holiday gratuities.", "description": "A group of economists also found that male and female drivers are not tipped at the same rate.", "authors": ["Quentin Fottrell", "Personal Finance Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP796_airpor_ZG_20180910135414.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
