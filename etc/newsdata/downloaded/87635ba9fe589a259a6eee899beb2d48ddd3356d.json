It\u2019s unclear what the punishment will be if a student or faculty member is caught using a mobile device on campus.\n\nAccording to local media, the extreme measure was likely the brainchild of the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Indian monk and Hindu nationalist Yogi Adityanath, who already prohibits the use of mobile phones during cabinet meetings. That ban was reportedly put in place because ministers were caught reading messages on WhatsApp during important government consultations.\n\nAlso on rt.com #FreeTheKnees: Women\u2019s college in India withdraws strict dress code after student protest (VIDEO)\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
