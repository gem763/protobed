We hit rock bottom and I found out what it\u2019s like to feel invisible.\u201d\n\nThe couple have since married and had daughter Lily, aged four.\n\nThe family now live in a \u201clittle house\u201d in Pensilva, near Liskeard, and Gylisa Jayne has found fame as mummy blogger Rock and Roll Mother.\n\nHowever, when she first came to Cornwall from Stratford-upon-Avon, Gylisa Jayne \u201cfelt like I wasn\u2019t part of society \u2013 it was so degrading\u201d.\n\nThe couple were living in the historic birthplace of William Shakespeare but both felt \u201ccompletely unfulfilled\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was living with my dad who was mentally unwell and I was being bullied at work.\n\n(Image: Gylisa Jayne)\n\n\u201cWe were members of a health spa in Stratford-upon-Avon and one day we were in the jacuzzi when Ryan said \u2018why don\u2019t we just go?'\n\n\u201cPeople talk about it all the time, don\u2019t they \u2026 running away and starting a new life, but no one ever does.\u201d\n\nWithout telling anyone \u2013 including their parents \u2013 Gylisa Jayne and Ryan threw some clothes and a duvet into their battered old Renault Clio and drove from the West Midlands to Cornwall.\n\n\"Pretty soon we ran out of money and were on skid row,\" she said.\n\nGylisa Jane now admits that they were both naive and didn't realise how difficult it would be to find work and a home while living in a car in Torpoint.\n\n\"We found out that not many people want to hire people for work when you don't have an address.\"\n\nThe couple started off in the Torpoint area before parking up opposite the Child Support Agency and Tesco store in Plympton, Plymouth .\n\n(Image: Gylisa Jayne)\n\nThe couple had to sleep sat up in the Clio's seats as they didn't recline and washed twice in two months at Plymouth Life Centre.\n\n\"We scrubbed and scrubbed until we were red\" - and would use the Tesco toilets and wet wipes the rest of the time.\n\nShe added: \"We couldn't tax and insure the car because we had run out of money and were homeless. We were s****ing ourselves as the car was all we had.\n\n\"We came down with the best intentions and started looking for jobs and homes immediately, but didn't realise how difficult it would be - without the safety net of a home it's almost impossible to get benefits and get yourself out of the situation.\n\n\"We realised we were on our own.\"\n\nIt was during this time that Gylisa Jayne started writing a diary, which provides the basis for Ever the Optimist.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\n\"We were living on two tins of soup a day and a two-litre bottle of water - it wasn't pleasant,\" she recalled. \"We became so ashamed of how we were living and started to think we had made a huge mistake.\"\n\nDespite some passersby being rude, judgmental and even reporting them to the police, they also saw the good side of humanity.\n\nGylisa Jayne said: \"In the book I talk about quite a few moments where strangers performed random acts of kindness.\n\n\"There was a woman who worked at the Child Support Agency, near where we were parked, who kept saying if we needed anything to let her know.\n\n\"One day she gave us a huge parcel of food, filled with all sorts of things. Even chocolate and juice were like luxuries to us by then. It was amazing.\"\n\nThings started to improve when Ryan got a job as a delivery driver. After living in the car for three months (they survived on just \u00a315 worth of petrol for the last two months), the couple got the keys to a flat in Liskeard.\n\n(Image: Gylisa Jayne)\n\nRyan now works as a self-employed builder and the couple were married this year, and now live in a house in Pensilva with their daughter. \"We are completely settled,\" said Gylisa Jane.\n\nShe added: \"Writing my diary got me through being homeless - it would while away the hours and allowed me to think things could only get better.\n\n\"The response to the book has already been incredible. It was a very difficult time but our lives are now wonderful.\"\n\nThe independently published book is available in Kindle and paperback versions here .", "description": "Gylisa Jayne Evans, 27, washed herself using wet wipes and survived on tins of soup and bottles of water after moving to Cornwall with her partner six years ago", "authors": ["Lee Trewhela", "Image", "Gylisa Jayne", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13896632.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gylisa-Jayne.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
