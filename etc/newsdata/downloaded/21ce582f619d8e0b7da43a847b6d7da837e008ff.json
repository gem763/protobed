One of those revealed today is a set of branded cookware from Le Creuset, which includes one item in particular that aims a blaster right at your poor wallet.\n\nDisney execs have dubbed today to be \u201cTriple Force Friday,\u201d a day when they reveal their new toys and merch ahead of the film\u2019s release. Le Creuset\u2018s new products were part of this, presumably targeted towards a more mature breed of fan.\n\nAnd I admit, they look pretty good. We\u2019ve got Millennium Falcon trivets, a Porg pie bird, a round Dutch oven with Darth Vader\u2019s helmet etched into the lid (a comparatively subtle design too), and three mini cocottes painted to resemble each of the series most famous droids. See the collection for yourself in this video:\n\nProbably the most attractive is the Han Solo Roaster, which depicts the famous smuggler\u2019s carbonite form on the lid. It won\u2019t come cheap at $450, but damn is it cool to look at.\n\nBut the most exclusive and expensive part of the collection wasn\u2019t even announced with the rest. It got its own special promotional video. I give you\u2026 the Tatooine Round Dutch Oven:\n\nThis 3.5 quart Dutch oven is hand-painted enameled cast iron. Le Creuset reports it\u2019ll only be making nine of them, in reference to the nine films in the Skywalker saga. And gird your loins: according to the store page, this little beaut will set you back a whopping $900.\n\nJust for the sake of comparison, a non-Star Wars 3.5 quart enameled cast iron Le Creuset Dutch oven (try saying that five times fast) I found on Amazon costs $350. That\u2019s still a high price, but much less than the princely sum its demanding for the Tatooine Dutch Oven. I\u2019d only give that much for a piece of branded merch if the proceeds were going to charity.\n\nBut you and I both know nine Star Wars superfans out there will gladly shell out 900 credits for this madness.\n\nI\u2019m curious about the fact that the least-branded piece of cookware costs the most. Maybe this is a mark of my failing as a fangirl, but I\u2019d have to look at that Dutch oven for a very long time before it clicked for me that the two blots of color are supposed to be Tatooine\u2019s twin suns. The Millennium Falcon trivet or the R2-D2 mini cocotte are instantly recognizable and yet are comparatively inexpensive ($20 & $30, respectively).\n\nThe cookware will be available to purchase November 1. According to Le Creuset, it\u2019ll be available from its own stores and YuppieChef.\n\nRead next: How to get started on Threads, Instagram's DM app", "description": "", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FStar-Wars-Dutch-Oven.jpg&signature=f85a3ee9c2ead521f61934bbe8cc574b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
