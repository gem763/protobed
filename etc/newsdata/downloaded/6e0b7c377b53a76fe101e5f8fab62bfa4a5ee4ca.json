But she is betting that consolidating the left is her best path to victory. The WFP endorsement is a step in that direction, not simply because it will add some field troops to Warren\u2019s side. \u201cWhat\u2019s most important is that it sets up a permission structure for people to gravitate to the candidate with the most authentic progressive brand,\u201d Kwatra says. \u201cIt\u2019s an unequivocal statement that the progressive energy in the race is increasingly moving toward Warren. It\u2019s a pretty emphatic exclamation point in the primary-within-a-primary fight between her and Bernie, and it\u2019s going to allow other progressive organizations and unions to get behind Warren.\u201d\n\nThe next front in the battle will be trying to land crucial institutional players in battleground states, like AFSCME and the state teachers union in Iowa and the Culinary Workers union in Nevada. \u201cYou could argue that Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t have squeezed by us in Iowa in 2016 if she hadn\u2019t had SEIU and AFSCME working as hard as they did,\u201d Longabaugh says. \u201cClearly they gave her a slight organizational boost.\u201d\n\nThe WFP endorsement could also help Warren in her pursuit of the glossiest individual prize on the left: The backing of Ocasio-Cortez. The star congresswoman volunteered on the Sanders campaign in 2016, and traveled to Kansas for a rally with him last year. In March, Ocasio-Cortez met privately with Warren, who later wrote an effusive essay for Time about the freshmen Democratic socialist. This summer both Sanders and Warren endorsed Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a progressive outsider running for district attorney in Queens; AOC\u2019s congressional district covers part of the borough. \u201cBernie is still winning the millennial vote, but Warren is a close second. People\u2019s hearts and minds are split, and I think hers are too,\u201d an Ocasio-Cortez colleague says. \u201cIf she ends up staying neutral, it may be more damaging for Bernie\u2014but it would be less damaging to AOC.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Chris Smith", "Vanityfair.Com News How-Elizabeth-Warren-Is-Eating-Sanderss-Left-Lunch"], "top_image": ""}
