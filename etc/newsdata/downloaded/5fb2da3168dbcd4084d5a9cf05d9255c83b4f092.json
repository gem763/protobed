The police came into the bus and checked everyone,\" James Reis, a passenger who arrived nine hours ahead of his flight home to Portugal, told AFP.\n\n- Travel chaos -\n\nIn recent weeks, the airport -- the world's eighth busiest -- has become a repeated target of pro-democracy protesters as they try to ramp up pressure on Beijing and city leaders by denting Hong Kong's reputation as a stable business hub.\n\nBut the tactic is controversial because of the travel misery it causes -- and the fact that the target is not the state but ordinary people.\n\nLast month hundreds of flights were cancelled over two days when huge crowds of protesters staged a sit-in at the airport, with ugly scenes playing out as two men suspected of being Chinese spies were beaten.\n\nPrevious protests at the airport had been non-disruptive and peaceful, aimed at enlightening travellers about the movement's goals.\n\nSince the violent scenes, security has been ramped up around the sprawling hub -- which lies on reclaimed land west of the main city -- and access to the terminals has been restricted to those with boarding passes.\n\nBut last Sunday protesters returned to the airport and showed they could still wreak havoc.\n\nOperators of the express train that links the airport and the city suspended services after the station was besieged and objects were thrown onto the rail line.\n\nRoads we also blocked forcing stranded travellers to abandon their vehicles and drag their luggage for many kilometres.\n\nProtesters have said their movement will only end when other key demands are met such as an amnesty for those arrested, an independent inquiry into the police and the granting of fully free elections, all of which Lam and Beijing have rejected.\n\n- 'Sacrifice' -\n\nAt a peaceful rally on Friday night in the city's commercial district, many protesters said they planned to continue hitting the streets.\n\n\"It's too late now. In these three months, a lot of people have sacrificed themselves and been arrested,\" said a retiree who gave his surname as Cheng, bursting into tears as he spoke.\n\nThe same night, tear gas was fired at small groups of more hardline protesters who were shining laser pens at a police station in the district of Mongkok, an area that has seen repeated clashes.\n\nThey later built barricades and vandalised a nearby subway station. Protesters are planning a rally outside the US consulate on Sunday afternoon.", "description": "Riot police fanned out across Hong Kong on Saturday and thwarted plans by pro-democracy protesters to target the airport, days after the city's leader made a surprise concession which was rejected by the movement as too little, too late.
