Without that there is no game anymore.'\n\nAs an aside, the situation tested the laws to breaking point. While the match was expunged from both sides' win/loss records, the five yellow cards picked up by United players remained on their records and it counted as one game served of Emmanuel Petit's three-fixture ban that he was serving at the time.\n\nNevetheless, Arsenal won the replay by the same 2-1 scoreline and Sheffield United were eliminated.\n\nA legendary save... and a player KO'd by a ref\n\nA further seven meetings would follow over the next decade across the FA Cup, League Cup and Premier League.\n\nAlthough the Baldes would draw one and win just one of those fixtures, they became a persistent thorn in the side of Wenger and his steadily declining team.\n\nThe first game after that infamous fifth-round clash was also in the FA Cup - but this time for a place in the final.\n\nHaving fought their way to the semi-final at Old Trafford, Warnock's men had sight of a major final and were the better team for much of the game.\n\nDavid Seaman pulled off an incredible save to deny Paul Peschisolido in the FA Cup semi-final\n\nThe Gunners had a miracle save from David Seaman to thank, the veteran stopper defying physics to somehow reach back and claw away Paul Peschisolido's header from on the goal-line in the 84th minute.\n\nIndeed, the man himself rates it quite highly: 'They say, \"I don't know how you managed to get a hand to it when the ball was only two inches from the line\", and I tell them it was a lot closer than that!'\n\nIt took a Freddie Ljungberg tap-in after penalty-box pinball to secure progress for the eventual cup winners, but even that goal was not without controversy.\n\nIn the build-up, Blades' Michael Tonge and referee Graham Poll had collided, rendering the midfielder unable to assist in defence.\n\nIn what was becoming a recurring theme of these match-ups, Warnock was infuriated and demanded a rematch, also calling for Poll to be banned.\n\nA rare victory over Arsenal was secured by Christian Nade at Bramall Lane in 2006\n\n\ud83d\udd19 to when Phil Jagielka had to go in goal against Arsenal and he ended up keeping a clean sheet! \u274c\n\n\n\nClass \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f#SUFC #TwitterBlades pic.twitter.com/T6OAXgUUCr \u2014 \u2694 Blades1889 \u2694 (@Blades1889_com) October 14, 2019\n\n'I just cannot accept that they should go on to the next game without being punished when they make such unbelievable errors and nothing is said, it's just soul destroying.'\n\nThe growing tension between the clubs was again on show during their 2005 FA Cup tie, which was not for the faint-hearted. A Philippe Senderos handball in the final minute handed United the gift of a penalty, which Andy Gray converted. United lost the replay in a shootout at Bramall Lane after another match of bone-crunching intensity.\n\nBut when Warnock and his team won promotion to the Premier League the next year, things would ramp up a notch again.\n\nA defender in goal\n\nArsenal won their first meeting with ease but in their next encounter Christian Nade would write his name into Sheffield United folklore with the winner.\n\nWenger's men were riding high as usual while their rivals were suffering down in 17th, so nobody expected an upset. Except perhaps the Bramall Lane crowd who roared their team into every crunching challenge on a cold, wet Yorkshire night.\n\nYet Nade, spinning onto a long ball and calmly firing past Jens Lehmann - who had charged crazily off his line - secured a rare victory against the title contenders.\n\nThat was barely half the story though, after keeper Paddy Kenny was forced off injured in the 60th minute.\n\nThroughout this period, Warnock opted to nominate Phil Jagielka as his back-up keeper, and somehow the centre-back kept Arsenal at bay.\n\nRobin van Persie and Julio Baptista were both denied in a fraught and backs-to-the-wall effort.\n\nBlades defender Phil Jagielka was forced into playing half an hour as goalkeeper in the win\n\nWarnock regularly opted not to select a specialist keeper on the bench due to Jagielka's skill\n\n'It was probably the proudest moment since I became a manager, with the crowd and the atmosphere,' said Warnock afterwards. 'We always put everything in. We won tackles, the goal was super and the crowd were brilliant. It was a great result.\n\n'I like having an extra forward on the bench. I didn't panic when he (Jagielka) went in goal, he doesn't get worried and neither do I. It's the only chance he's got of being man-of-the-match.'\n\nWhat next?\n\nThat great triumph was perhaps the peak of the rivalry between the two clubs - although Warnock and Wenger continued to go hammer and tongs at each other pitchside for many more years.\n\nThe next two matches saw heavy defeats for United in the League Cup before an enforced ceasefire due to their Premier League relegation.\n\nThe last game was a heavy 6-0 League Cup third round loss in September 2008, with Nicklas Bendtner and Carlos Vela scoring twice each and Jack Wilshere notching his first professional goal.\n\nThis week's match has already attracted the rancour of Gunners fans - it comes just three days before Vitoria Guimaeres visit the Emirates in the Europa League.\n\nThe Blades have enjoyed a moderate start to life back in the top flight, although Chris Wilder warned: 'Arsenal are an historic, iconic club and it is another brilliant fixture for us as a football club,' he said.\n\nMonday night may, though, see those fires of rivalry burn bright again once more.", "description": "Arsenal and Sheffield United are set to renew hostilities - more than 11 years after the clubs last met.
