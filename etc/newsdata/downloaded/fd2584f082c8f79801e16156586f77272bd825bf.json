The fell about 2% in August, pressured by rising recession worries and on-again, off-again hopes of a trade resolution, which moved the market in both directions.\n\nWith these macro headwinds in mind, here are three stocks investors should keep an eye on this coming week, especially as some top U.S. companies will start to see the actual impact of the U.S. enhanced tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to kick in beginning Sept. 1.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple (NASDAQ: ) will be among the most exposed companies to the U.S.-China trade war and this coming week will see some of the company\u2019s hardware hit by the higher tariffs.\n\nApple has been lobbying the Trump administration to find a way to save its products from the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. During a recent dinner with the president, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook voiced concerns that Apple\u2019s main rival, South Korea's Samsung Electronics (OTC: ) will get an edge since its products won\u2019t be subject to the levies.\n\nAAPL Weekly TTM\n\nThese worries have weighed on Apple shares, which have fallen about 7% during the past 12 months. They closed on Friday $208.74, down 0.25%.\n\nThe biggest risk that Apple is facing is a possible disruption of the company\u2019s massive supply-chain system in China if the two countries fail to resolve differences.The iPhone, which accounts for more than half of Apple\u2019s revenue, won\u2019t be subject to this 15% tariff until Dec. 15. But the company's other hardware products won\u2019t be able to escape the new tariff regime.\n\nAccording to a Bloomberg report, a 15% tariff on Apple wearable gadgets sold in the U.S. would likely reduce earnings by $0.5 to $0.10 a share per year.\n\n2. Zoom Video\n\nZoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ), one of the most successful U.S. IPOs so far in 2019, will release its second quarter earnings on Thursday, Sept. 5, after the market close.\n\nZM 300 Minute Chart\n\nOn average, analysts expect a penny a share profit on sales of $130.31 million. For the , the video conferencing company had posted earnings that beat expectations, powering the stock\u2019s 151% run since its IPO in mid-April. Its shares closed at $91.67, up about 1% on Friday.\n\nOne stark difference between Zoom Video and other high profile IPOs in 2019 has been that the company has shown profitability from day one of its public debut, unlike other tech names which typically burn significant amounts of cash ahead of any profitability. Zoom made $7.58 million in net income last year. Revenue surged 118% to $330.5 million.\n\nThe company is trying to make video communication frictionless, at a time when more employees work remotely, using conferencing services to connect with coworkers. International Data Corp. has estimated that the segments of the market in which Zoom operates could be worth as much as $43.1 billion by 2022, according to a regulatory filing.\n\n3. Slack Technologies\n\nSlack Technologies (NYSE: ), another newly-listed tech company, reports its second quarter earnings on Wednesday, Sept. 4, after the market close. Analysts, on average, expect a loss of -$0.18 a share on sales of $140.7 million.\n\nWORK 300 Minute Chart\n\nSince it started trading on June 20, Slack shares have been on a downward slope, losing about a quarter of their value. They fell more than 4% on Friday to close at $28.64 a share.\n\nSlack lost $31.9 million in the three months ended April 30, up 28% from the year prior, according to its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June.\n\nBut even with widening losses, Slack is also expanding sales, which rose by 67% to $134.8 million in Q1 as the number of paying customers surged. The company may instill some life into its sagging stock if it reports a higher number of paying customers for the past quarter while also having succeeded in shrinking its losses for Q2.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Haris Anwar/Investing.com covering: S&P 500, Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Zoom Video Communications Inc.
