It's like it's possessed.\n\n\"You can imagine how shocked I was. When I was a child I had my mouth washed out with soap by my mum if I swore so I don't swear. I didn't laugh, I was put out by it.\"\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nTracy, who has a reputation for being terrible at directions, was given the device by her exasperated sister Donna Brooke 12 months ago.\n\nDonna offered her the GPS after discovering Tracy had ended up driving round Heathrow terminal three on her way home from visiting her in Brentwood - a trip she'd made countless times before.\n\nTechnophobe Tracy spent months hopping out of her blue Nissan Note to stop people on the street and ask them to input her destination into the GPS.\n\nOne day a kind-hearted passerby gave her a crash course in how to use it and activated the voice instructions so Tracy wouldn't have to rely on reading the map while behind the wheel.\n\nTracy claims that one day out of the blue six months ago, instead of the soothing strains of the female sat nav voice a 'deep growly' male voice popped up and started spouting filth.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\nTracy said: \"It's hit and miss, he doesn't come on all the time.\n\n\"If I delay in taking the turning because of traffic or I go past a turning that's when he generally starts.\n\n\"As I'm driving along I start to think the horrible man has gone away and it's just the nice lady and then all of a sudden when you least expect it the chap butts in and he starts again.\n\n\"My sister Donna gave it to me because I get lost quite easily.\n\n\"When I first got it I couldn't figure out how to use it so I used to stop and ask strangers to show me, but then someone showed me how to set up the 'home' button.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"When I started using it it used to get me lost even more so I used to have rows with it.\n\n\"I would shout 'you're a stupid sat nav, you don't have a clue where we're going, I'm not listening to you anymore.\n\n\"All of a sudden it just started talking to me and swearing at me, I was most put out.\"\n\nAfter six months of putting up with the rude voice, Tracy confessed to her 22-year-old primary school teacher daughter the issue she was having.\n\nTracy said: \"I was in the car with Jade and said 'I've got a rude sat nav'.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"She found it funny and thought her 17-year-old brother Ethan was responsible but he hasn't been near it and it doesn't sound anything like him.\"\n\nJade said she was unconvinced the sat nav was actually swearing at her mum but burst out laughing when she heard the foul language for herself.\n\nJade said: \"I wasn't convinced that the sat nav was swearing at her, I thought maybe she was mishearing it.\n\n\"Then it did it and I was crying with laughter.\n\n(Image: Kennedy News and Media)\n\n\"I knew people wouldn't believe me so I tried recording it, it was really frustrating when I kept missing this voice.\n\n\"I have minutes of video on my phone just trying to capture it and managed to catch it when we arrived at our destination.\n\n\"I confronted Ethan over it and he said he hadn't touched it. It doesn't sound like his voice, he's never in the car with and has sworn on all our lives it's not him.\n\n\"My aunty and uncle had bought it new. But they are very sensible and have two young children, so it's not likely to have been them.\"\n\nTracy said: \"I'm used to it now so it doesn't shock me as much as it did when it first started.\n\n\"I wouldn't miss him if he suddenly disappeared.\"\n\nA TomTom spokesperson said: \"It's likely that Tracy has a sat nav where it's possible to record your own voice guidance (this is possible on some of our older devices).\n\n\"Whether it's a previous owner, or a cheeky family member or friend, we can assure Tracy that it's not the sat nav shouting obscenities at her.\n\n\"If Tracy changes the voice on her sat nav, the swearing will be gone.\n\n\"Because this story brought such a smile to our faces, we're going to send Tracy our latest and greatest TomTom Go Premium sat nav.\n\n\"It's the most feature-packed, best connected, and smartest navigation device on the market, and best of all, it doesn't have a potty mouth!\n\n\"She can also add more fun to her drive with TomTom navigation voices such as Brian Blessed, Billy Connelly or even Spongebob Squarepants.\"", "description": "Tracy Dockerill says her sat nav is getting revenge for her shouting at it - by repeatedly shouting an obscenities while she drives", "authors": ["Helen Le Caplain", "Lorraine King", "Image", "Kennedy News", "Media"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743687.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Kennedy-News-and-Media.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
