It\u2019s like watching TV for us,\u201d says Jennifer Cattet, an animal behavior researcher and owner of Medical Mutts, a service dog training center in Indianapolis.\n\nAlthough odors are probably the main attraction here, we shouldn\u2019t underestimate dogs\u2019 other senses. Contrary to popular belief, Cattet says sight is a dog\u2019s primary source of information. An open window is much more interesting than laying in the back seat.\n\nZielinski likens an open car window to a sensory trifecta for dogs. In addition to constantly changing sights and smells, dogs also get tactile stimulation from the air blowing on their faces, which probably feels good.", "description": "", "authors": ["Megan Schmidt", "Blogs.Discovermagazine.Com Crux Why-Your-Dog-Likes-Sticking-Its-Head-Out-The-Car-Window"], "top_image": ""}
