I think there\u2019s plenty of reasons to learn Scottish Gaelic and this just makes it more accessible for people to do so.\u201d\n\nMore than four million people are learning Irish on the site, with 1.2 million signed up to learn Welsh, while courses in \u201cindigenous and endangered\u201d languages including Navajo and Hawaiian were also launched last year.\n\nColin Watkins, Duolingo\u2019s UK country manager, said: \u201cOur mission is to make education free, fun and accessible to all.\n\n\u201cWe want everyone with an interest in seeing Scottish Gaelic thrive to share details of the course with their friends and family.\n\n\u201cAll it takes is to stop scrolling for five minutes a day and start doing something rewarding with your time, and at the same time keep Gaelic growing in Scotland and around the world.\u201d\n\nTo sign up for the Scottish Gaelic course, visit the Duolingo website.", "description": "Duolingo was launched in 2011 and has more than 90 languages to choose from.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/12/wire-19834808-1571312947-106_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
