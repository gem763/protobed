Companies such as Beyond Meat want their products to be housed where consumers go for real meat, but some grocery stores instead put them in the frozen department, or in the vegan or vegetarian aisle.\n\nBased on the results of the study, retailers will benefit by having \"clear, consistent, and accurate research results to guide merchandising and marketing decisions,\" Kroger and the PBFA wrote in a press release.\n\nRead more: The chief strategist at a $1 trillion investing giant says Trump is doomed to lose his trade war - and explains why that would be the best possible outcome for markets\n\nThe stakes are high for plant-based food producers. In the US, plant-based meats are a $14 billion industry that analysts think could balloon to $140 billion over the next decade. As demand for the plant-based products soars, many traditional food producers have launched their own lines to compete, including Kroger. The grocery store recently announced its own plant-based brand, called Simple Truth.\n\nIt's already clear the customers who buy plant-based meat also buy traditional meat - in fact, Beyond Meat's goal is to win over people who do eat meat as opposed to vegans or vegetarians with its products. It's shown in financial documents that more than 90% of customers who bought its product at a Kroger also bought meat last year.\n\nThe PBFA is also involved in a number of cases pushing back against labelling laws that make it illegal for plant-based meat producers to use words such as \"hot dog\" \"burger\" and \"bacon\" to describe products. Recently,\n\n\"Plant-based meat sales have been increasing dramatically year over year, even while most of them are placed where only the most dedicated consumers are likely to find and purchase them,\" Julie Emmett, senior director of retail partnerships for the Plant Based Foods Association, said in a press release.\n\nShares of Kroger are down about 7% year to date.\n\nMarkets Insider", "description": "Some Kroger stores will soon put plant-based meat alternatives in the conventional meat department.
