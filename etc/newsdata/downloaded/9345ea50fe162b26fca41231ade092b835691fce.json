Oh, and your Parmigiano Reggiano and Scotch whisky are about to get more expensive. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 3rd October.\n\n1. Stocks set for dead cat bounce\n\nWall Street is set for a weak bounce at the open Thursday, with no indication of any serious rethink of the fears that were behind Wednesday\u2019s sell-off, the worst in two months.\n\nBy 6:15 AM ET, were up a modest 85 points or 0.3%, recouping barely 15% of yesterday\u2019s losses. were up 11 points or 0.4%. were also up 0.4%.\n\nPepsiCo (NASDAQ: ) started the day\u2019s earnings roll with a year-on-year decline in per share earnings on a modest increase in revenue. Both top and bottom lines were marginally above expectations. Brewer is due up next, while reports after the closing bell.\n\n2. Trump announces tariffs on EU imports\n\nThe Trump administration opened a new front in the trade war, announcing import tariffs on a range of European products after getting the go-ahead from the World Trade Organization to retaliate against unfair state aid to Airbus.\n\nIn addition to a 10% tariff on Airbus planes, there are 25% tariffs on Scotch whisky, Parmesan cheese and various luxury goods, although not leather goods. The tariffs on Airbus exempt components shipped to the company\u2019s factory in Mobile, Alabama, something that may appease U.S. airlines who lobbied against having to pay more for Airbus aircraft.\n\nThe tariffs announced were at the mild end of a range of expectations. Airbus (PA: ) was the biggest gainer on the Paris exchange Thursday morning, along with spirits maker Pernod Ricard (PA: ) and luxury goods group LVMH (PA: ).\n\n3. Growth fears resurface after weak PMIs, Brexit news\n\nThe day\u2019s data calendar is dominated by the release of IHS Markit\u2019s and purchasing managers indices, along with the Institute of Supply Management\u2019s surveys. They're due at 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT) and 10 AM ET (1400 GMT) respectively.\n\nMarkit\u2019s numbers for Europe were worse than expected, with the eurozone falling to 50.1, only a whisker above the line that divides expansion from contraction. The U.K. index fell below 50 to 49.3., triggering a further sell-off in U.K. stocks, compounded by a negative reaction from Brussels to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals for a tweaked withdrawal deal to ensure an orderly Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\n4. Tesla, GoPro disappoint\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: ) fell short of its own \u2013 and the market\u2019s \u2013 expectations with its third-quarter deliveries, which totalled 97,000. CEO Elon Musk had predicted the company would crack 100,000 for the first time.\n\nThe figures set the company up for an earnings disappointment too, given that the sales mix is now heavily skewed to the lower-margin Model 3. Tesla shares fell 4.0% in after-hours trading.\n\nAnother company to disappoint after the closing bell on Wednesday was GoPro (NASDAQ: ), whose shares fell 16% after production delays to its new Hero8 Black camera caused it to cut its outlook for the second half. GoPro has moved some production from China to Mexico in the last year but the company said that wasn\u2019t responsible for the delays.\n\n5. Impeachment depositions\n\nKurt Volker, a former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, will be deposed behind closed doors Thursday by the three House committees looking into President Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine to investigate the son his political rival, Joe Biden. He\u2019s the first of five current and former State Department staff who\u2019ve been called to appear before the House over the issue.\n\nTrump increased his attacks against House Intelligence Committee leader Adam Schiff at a press conference on Wednesday, calling for him to resign and be investigated for \u2018treason\u2019.\n\nThe official who first assessed the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint against Trump, Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, will testify behind closed doors on Friday, according to Bloomberg.", "description": "Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Thursday", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/wallstreet_2_800x533_L_1411479921.jpg"}
