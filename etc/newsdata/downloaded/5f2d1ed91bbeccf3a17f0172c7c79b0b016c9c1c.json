REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe global community had engaged with China to help it grow but now must demand the world\u2019s second-largest economy bring more transparency to its trade relationships and take a greater share of the responsibility for addressing climate change, Morrison said.\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s global institutions must adjust their settings for China, in recognition of this new status,\u201d said Morrison in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, referring to China as a \u201cnewly developed economy\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat means more will be expected of course, as has always been the case for nations like the United States who\u2019ve always had this standing,\u201d Morrison said in the speech, according to transcript provided to Reuters.\n\nGlobal trade rules were \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d and in some cases were \u201cdesigned for a completely different economy in another era, one that simply doesn\u2019t exist any more\u201d, he added.\n\nReferring to China as a newly developed economy marks a change from Beijing\u2019s self-declared status as a developing economy, which affords it concessions such as longer times to implement agreed commitments, according to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nIt also puts Australia into line with a campaign led by U.S. President Donald Trump to remove China\u2019s developing nation status. In an April 7, 2018 tweet, Trump wrote that China was a \u201cgreat economic power\u201d but received \u201ctremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S.\u201d\n\nMorrison has previously urged China to reform its economy and end a trade war with the United States but has until now stopped short of taking a public position on its WTO status.\n\nWhile two-way trade between Australia and China has grown since the countries signed a trade pact in 2015, increasing to a record A$183 billion (\u00a3102.2 billion) last year, the bilateral relationship has at times been strained.\n\nIn December 2017, former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull accused China of meddling in its domestic affairs. The relationship was further soured by Canberra\u2019s decision last year to effectively ban Chinese telecoms firm Huawei Technologies from its 5G broadband network rollout.\n\nMorrison said Australia and the United States had different relationships with China, given Australia had a trade surplus with China while the United States had a trade deficit.\n\n\u201cThe engagement with China has been enormously beneficial to our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to see that continue.\u201d", "description": "Global trade rules are \"no longer fit for purpose\" and must be changed to accommodate China's new status as a developed economy, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a major foreign policy speech in the United States.", "authors": ["Byron Kaye", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433138300&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N013", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
