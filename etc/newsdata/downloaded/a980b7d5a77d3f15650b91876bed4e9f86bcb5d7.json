However, she was grateful for the opportunity to enjoy a meal while her youngest child was entertained.\n\n\u201cI was iffy at first, my son doesn\u2019t do well with strangers,\u201d Corbitt said of Hampton\u2019s offer to assist her at El Mazatlan in Munfordville. \u201cI stood there holding my son as we chatted for a moment then I handed my son to the trooper. My son fussed but then began smiling and cooing so I sat down and ate while the trooper stood close with my son.\u201d\n\nThe moment became even sweeter as the 3-month-old baby named Zerak started smiling at the officer. Corbitt, who was accompanied by her 8-year-old son, 10-year-old daughter, and her mother, decided to take a quick snapshot.\n\n\u201cI wanted to capture the moment to share with my son when he got older,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mother posted it [to social media] first, then I posted immediately after.\u201d\n\nStill, neither Corbitt nor Hampton realized how much attention the photo would actually get. The trooper didn\u2019t even see the photo until it was shared on a Facebook page supporting local police.\n\n\u201cIn a time where law enforcement is viewed as the enemy, I am very happy to be a part of something so positive,\u201d Hampton tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cI never in a million years thought it would get this much attention, but it just goes to show you, sometimes the little things have a large affect on people. And if God puts something on your heart, please follow through.\u201d\n\nThe officer said he felt the need to offer his support to the mother since he has a young son of his own, and understands the difficulties of eating in public with a baby. To show her gratitude for the kind gesture, Corbitt quietly paid for Hampton\u2019s meal before leaving the restaurant.\n\n\u201cAround the world people are at war with those in blue, and this moment shows that they do go above and beyond their duties,\u201d Corbitt says. \u201cHolding my baby for a few moments so I could eat might not mean much to others but it meant the world to me!\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "A Kentucky State Trooper is receiving praise for his kind gesture toward a mom of three.", "authors": ["Kerry Justich"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.B7Ho60h1M9DZNJzhOYjuw--~B/aD0xNDQwO3c9ODAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/1a823070-e6f0-11e9-beaf-7121a13c1ef0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
