Not only that, but Brydge is suing Kickstarter, too, for hosting a crowdfunding campaign in support of the Libra keyboard.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a federal court in New York, accuses the company it believes is Libra\u2019s creator, OGadget, of violating a patent owned by Brydge. That patent covers the key features that make a Brydge keyboard work: primarily, a U-shaped hinge that\u2019s able to rotate the keyboard open and closed like a laptop when it\u2019s attached to something like an iPad.\n\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a bit of a kick in the face to our staff.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see something as brazen as this launch on Kickstarter ... honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a kick in the face to our staff tirelessly building the reputation we\u2019ve built,\u201d Nick Smith, CEO and co-founder of Brydge, tells The Verge.\n\nBrydge wants the court to block all sales of the Libra keyboard, which would include removing the crowdfunding campaign from Kickstarter. It\u2019s seeking punitive damages for the alleged patent violation, too.\n\nWhile there\u2019s a wide array of keyboard attachments for iPads, Brydge\u2019s products have always been distinct. They mimic the style of Apple\u2019s laptops, making the iPad look a lot like a MacBook Pro when one is attached. My colleague Sam Byford recently called one of Brydge\u2019s keyboards the \u201cbest option\u201d for getting a laptop-like experience out of the iPad Pro.\n\nBrydge has a patent protecting elements of its U-shaped clamp\n\nThe Libra keyboard looks very similar to a Brydge keyboard, and it attaches to the iPad in a similar way, using a U-shaped clamp. Smith says Brydge\u2019s patent, which revolves around the clamp mechanic, is the reason many other keyboard makers use folio designs or magnet arrays to attach to tablets. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt what we have is very unique,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s why no one else does it.\u201d\n\nIn its lawsuit, Brydge includes a series of photos showing side-by-side similarities between the two devices, from their hinges to their overall design. While Smith says Brydge also has design patents protecting its keyboards, this lawsuit only focuses on the functional elements that make the keyboard attachments work, with a heavy focus on the hinge.\n\nThe Libra keyboard does have one major difference, though: it has a built-in trackpad, whereas Brydge doesn\u2019t include a trackpad on any of its iPad products. To make the two devices look more alike, the lawsuit includes photos of an unreleased prototype Brydge keyboard with a trackpad on it.\n\nSmith says Brydge is weeks away from beginning to manufacture its own iPad keyboard with a built-in trackpad. Brydge hopes to start sales in January or February, though production will be limited to no more than 4,000 units at first. Smith says the initial launch will be branded as a \u201cbeta,\u201d in large part because he wants to make sure customers understand that the trackpad\u2019s features are limited because only basic mouse features are available in iPadOS.\n\nSuing Kickstarter is meant to speed up the process of taking down Libra\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be putting ourselves out there as great, but the iPad experience isn\u2019t amazing,\u201d Smith says of the mouse features that were added to iPadOS last month. The \u201cbeta\u201d launch will let interested customers use the product \u201cknowing iPadOS will improve.\u201d\n\nBrydge says it sent a cease-and-desist letter to OGadget in mid-September and that OGadget stopped selling Libra on its website shortly thereafter. An image of the Libra keyboard is still up on OGadget\u2019s site, but the link to learn more about the product leads to an error page that says the website is \u201cno longer available.\u201d\n\nWeirdly enough, Brydge doesn\u2019t actually know for sure that OGadget makes the Libra keyboard. OGadget appears to be the company behind the product, but a spokesperson says Brydge is \u201cnot certain\u201d about it. That\u2019s because the Kickstarter campaign for Libra, as well as a press release about it, are both marketed under the brand Sentis. Outside of those two places, Sentis doesn\u2019t appear to have any online presence \u2014 even its advertised website doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThere are several ties between the two brands, though. Sentis links to a YouTube page for \u201cO Gadget\u201d in its press release, and it links to a Facebook Messenger page for OGadget on its Kickstarter campaign. OGadget also links to the Libra Kickstarter on its Twitter and Facebook accounts. But OGadget doesn\u2019t state that it owns the brand.\n\nThe Verge reached out to OGadget by email and did not hear back. We reached out to Sentis by email and on Kickstarter and did not hear back.\n\nThat confusion is one of the big reasons why the lawsuit\u2019s real target is Kickstarter, which is where Libra has been getting much of its exposure. The campaign, which launched September 24th, currently has more than 1,700 backers and has raised more than $220,000.\n\n\u201cKickstarter is really dear to our heart ... but we obviously had to include Kickstarter in the claim to ensure that it gets taken down,\u201d Smith says.\n\nBrydge got its start on Kickstarter, with a 2012 campaign that raised nearly $800,000 from more than 3,000 backers. The company has launched dozens of products since, including keyboard attachments designed to fit most iPads, but none have appeared on Kickstarter since the first campaign.\n\nKickstarter will remove projects over patent violations, according to a copyright help page that a spokesperson sent to The Verge. The company relies on court findings of infringement, though, and Brydge may not have that until long after the Libra campaign wraps up. Suing Kickstarter directly seems to be meant to make a takedown happen faster. Kickstarter\u2019s spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nBrydge isn\u2019t the first company to go after Kickstarter over projects it\u2019s hosting. 3D Systems sued Kickstarter in 2012 when it claimed a crowdfunded 3D printer was violating one of its patents. And in 2015, a patent troll sued Kickstarter for hosting a campaign for a cybersex product it claimed was infringing on a patent. Neither case worked out for the plaintiffs: both 3D Systems and the patent troll dropped their cases.\n\nSmith says Brydge is also targeting Kickstarter because it\u2019s an American company, unlike OGadget, which appears to be based in China.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what is Libra? Libra is not a little company,\u201d Smith says. \u201cLibra\u2019s basically a factory in Shenzhen that\u2019s copied our product and is using Kickstarter to sell it. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d", "description": "The lawsuit accuses Libra\u2019s creator of violating a patent owned by Brydge. \"To see something as brazen as this launch on Kickstarter ... honestly, it\u2019s a bit of a kick in the face to our staff tirelessly building the reputation we\u2019ve built,\" says Nick Smith, CEO and co-founder of Brydge.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsLNfoaQ5kSp7ukzfd5_CVIK5XE=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19272003/DSCF7154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
