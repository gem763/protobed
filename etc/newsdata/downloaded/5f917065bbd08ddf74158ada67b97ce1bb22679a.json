Security leaders at large financial services organizations would dress up in superhero costumes and hand out flyers to their employees, reminding users of basic security concepts such as strong passwords. This was a time-intensive, one-off activity that was limited to those organizations that could afford it.\n\nFast-forward to now: Cybersecurity strategy is on the agenda of most of the world's boardrooms. Your employees and customers are much more digitally savvy and expect you to protect them without annoying them. Communicating cybersecurity messages and ensuring that all employees remain cybersafe is no longer a niche activity. In that vein, many CISOs I speak with see this month as a must.\n\nHere are some tips to get the most out of Cybersecurity Awareness Month:\n\nPlan for it as you would for any other security project. This time of year sneaks up on us in security every single year. October -- the month of Halloween and Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Cybersecurity Awareness Month is a bit like birthdays, anniversaries, and Christmas. They happen every year, and yet every year some people (like me) are surprised by them and run around scrambling for gift ideas -- and then there are others, like my sister, who methodically compile a list of gifts, prepare a menu, and purchase everything months before the event. Be like my sister! Stay on top of planning and start organizing your Cybersecurity Awareness Month campaigns well in advance.\n\nThis time of year sneaks up on us in security every single year.

Partner with governments and like-minded communities to learn and share ideas. Help build and develop a security ecosystem by engaging agencies and associations to deliver far-reaching solutions. Take an example from the Australian government's Stay Smart Online team on Safer Internet Day: It collaborated with several CISOs around the country to determine a theme for secure communication. They ended up agreeing on the \"ask out loud\" concept, which organizations used to encourage nontechnical users to discuss security concerns and ask questions when they aren't sure. Another Aussie example: The Australia Security Influence and Trust Group community provides an affirming and energizing way to meet other professionals tackling similar issues and share solutions.\n\nHelp build and develop a security ecosystem by engaging agencies and associations to deliver far-reaching solutions.

Determine your outcomes and measure the ROI of your campaigns. We know that many CISOs struggles with justifying any investment in awareness, behavior, and culture activities, and Cybersecurity Awareness Month is no exception. Be clear on the behaviors you want to target during the month and define a way to measure whether the campaigns you put in place have been successful in changing those behaviors. For example, if you have a booth or an escape room that engages users in selecting strong passwords, measure whether users changed their passwords after taking part.
