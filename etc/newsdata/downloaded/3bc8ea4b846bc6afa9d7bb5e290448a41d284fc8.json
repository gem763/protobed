Attackers using the flaw could alter text from quoted messages and manipulate the thread of a conversation\n\nIsraeli-based cybersecurity firm Check Point Research (CPR), who uncovered the flaw, warned that 'malicious actors' may use the glitch to spread misinformation and fake news.\n\nTheir team detailed the hack at the Black Hat cyber-security conference in Las Vegas, attended by other experts who also uncover vulnerabilities in popular software.\n\nCPR screened a video which illustrated how easily a message can be doctored.\n\nThey claim Facebook bosses were made aware of the issue last year, but are yet to resolve it.\n\nIn a written statement on CPR's site, the company said: 'Towards the end of 2018, Check Point Research notified WhatsApp about new vulnerabilities in the popular messaging application that would enable threat actors to intercept and manipulate messages sent in both private and group conversations, giving attackers the power to create and spread misinformation from what appear to be trusted sources.\n\n'We believe these vulnerabilities to be of the utmost importance and require attention.'\n\nBefore: Here, the team at Check Point Research illustrate the glitch by depicting a conversation between an employee and their manager\n\nAfter: Here, the message from the boss has been doctored - a clear example of how 'malicious actors' can use the flaw to spread misinformation and fake news\n\nFake views: The glitch also allows people to send themselves messages on behalf of someone else, effectively creating what appears to be a two-way conversation\n\nWhatsApp says it doesn't recognise the glitch as a flaw in its software but it did fix another error, which allowed people to send a private message to another group participant, disguised as a public message.\n\n'We carefully reviewed this issue a year ago and it is false to suggest there is a vulnerability with the security we provide on WhatsApp,' a spokesperson told Forbes.\n\n'The scenario described here is merely the mobile equivalent of altering replies in an email thread to make it look like something a person didn\u2019t write.\n\n'We need to be mindful that addressing concerns raised by these researchers could make WhatsApp less private, such as storing information about the origin of messages.'\n\nMailOnline contacted representative for Facebook - the company that owns WhatsApp comment, but they are yet to respond.\n\nDetails of the flaw are published on the Check Point Research site.", "description": "WhatsApp could be following in Snapchat's footsteps with new self-destructing messages.
