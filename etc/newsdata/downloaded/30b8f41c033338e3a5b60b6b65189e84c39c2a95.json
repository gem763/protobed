(Photo: The CW)\n\nWhen Arrow launched an entire universe or two of superhero TV in 2012, one of its most audacious moves \u2014 beyond like, being good; it was a dark time for superhero TV! \u2014 was to immediately set comic book fans\u2019 heads on fire with the mother of all teases: Deathstroke\u2019s mask nonchalantly sitting on the shore of Oliver\u2019s island of exile. Turns out, it was a tease that wasn\u2019t just unplanned, but also weirdly random.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly, Marc Guggenheim, Arrow\u2019s consulting producer and co-creator, revealed that the tease of that iconic black-and-orange mask sitting atop a speared arrow on Lian Yu\u2019s shore wasn\u2019t actually planned.\n\nIn fact, Arrow\u2019s creative team apparently had no intent of teasing either Deathstroke or his alter ego, Slade Wilson (who would eventually be played in the series by Manu Bennett) in the first season at all. The decision to throw the mask into the pilot was a spontaneous decision from DC Comics\u2019 Geoff Johns and pilot director David Nutter:\n\nDavid Nutter was on set [of the pilot], and he wanted basically a foreground element. He was like, \u2018What can we stick here?\u2019 and he had the idea of maybe something with an arrow through it. Geoff Johns happened to be on set and said, \u2018Well, what if it\u2019s like a mask, it\u2019s half-black and half-orange, and it\u2019s basically the Deathstroke mask?\u2019 And we were like, \u2018Oh, great Easter egg!\u2019 because we were all about the Easter eggs back then.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly remarkable how noncommittal it all seems \u2014 especially in the context of here and now, with Arrow about to come to a final end after eight seasons of almost non-stop comics cameos and crossovers, amid the universe of shows it\u2019s spawned coming together for what is shaping up to be the most ridiculous crossover superhero TV could ever do, Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nBut what\u2019s funniest about this now is that, essentially, Guggenheim\u2019s story of how randomly \u201ceh\u201d teasing Deathstroke\u2019s appearance came about actually made it into the text of the show. Back in the show\u2019s fifth season, Arrow\u2019s flashback sub-plot finally gave us the backstory of how Oliver Queen made it back to the island of Lian Yu.\n\nThose flashbacks, of course, had already spent five seasons showing Ollie getting stuck on Lian Yu, getting off of Lian Yu, bumping into John Constantine, hanging out with some Russians, and ditching a truly, spectacularly good-bad wig, so, you know \u2014 he had to get back so he could be where he needed to be to line up with how Arrow actually began in the first place.\n\nAnyway, as part of that process \u2014 and after five whole years of fans speculating just how that Deathstroke mask got to Lian Yu in the first place, because surely it must have meant something \u2014 Arrow\u2019s answer to that question, considering it had already shown Slade had long been off of Lian Yu at this point in its confusing continuity, was basically \u201clol dunno\u201d:\n\nIt\u2019s still hilariously blah to watch unfold. Just random chance, an ominous sign, that it happened to wash up on the shore? All that speculation for nothing? This is a series that, moments afterwards, managed to explain Ollie\u2019s incredible castaway flashback hair wig within the actual text of the show (he was given it as cover!). And yet the Deathstroke tease was just meant to be happenstance? Talk about an anti-climax.\n\nBut at least we know now, thanks to Guggenheim, it was just as anti-climactic behind the scenes, too.", "description": "When Arrow launched an entire universe or two of superhero TV in 2012, one of its most audacious moves \u2014 beyond like, being good; it was a dark time for superhero TV! \u2014 was to immediately set comic book fans\u2019\u00a0heads on fire with the mother of all teases: Deathstroke\u2019s mask nonchalantly sitting on the shore of...", "authors": ["James Whitbrook", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/rpsxrskuznrkwvikcflq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
