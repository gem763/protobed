And on Tuesday evening they were put through the wringer.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat spent much of the evening\u2019s Democratic primary debate being dragged by her opponents. It was a different treatment from what she received in the past, when she often managed to skate through the debates without drawing attacks or ire.\n\nBut that ended on the stage inside Otterbein College\u2019s Rike Center. And it signified that Warren\u2019s steady rise in the polls has turned her insurgent candidacy into that of a frontrunner.\n\nAfter The New York Times\u2019 Marc Lacey asked Warren to answer yes or no whether her Medicare for All plan would raise taxes on the middle class\u2014as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) has conceded would happen under his similar proposal\u2014Warren launched into a detailed, and now familiar, dodge.\n\nPressed again by the moderator, she did it again.\n\n\u201cCosts will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hardworking middle-class families, costs will go down,\u201d Warren said, side stepping the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d request.\n\nWhen asked to respond, Mayor Pete Buttigieg called her out.\n\n\u201cYou heard it tonight: a yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said. \u201cYour signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything, except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.\u201d\n\nThen Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) brought down the hammer.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipe dream is a plan is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nIt was the beginning of a sustained attack of Warren and her canon of plans, seemingly aimed at bringing her and her poll numbers down to earth as well as highlight the moderate options in a primary that has increasingly rewarded the most liberal proposals. The exchanges also provided a glimpse into what the next few months could look like for Warren should she remain at or near the top of the pack.\n\nDuring the conversation about Warren\u2019s wealth tax\u2014a plan to tax the ultra wealthy at 2 percent or 3 percent depending on their income, several candidates sought to shut down the senator\u2019s claim that she and Sanders were the only candidates willing to go up against the super rich.\n\n\u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\u201d Warren said during one defense of her proposal. \u201cIt\u2019s why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\u201d\n\n\u201c I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. \u201d \u2014 Amy Klobuchar\n\n\u201cNo one is supporting billionaires,\u201d former vice president Joe Biden interjected.\n\nFrom there, Klobuchar picked up the baton. \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\u201d\n\nWarren responded, \u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.\u201d\n\nTo which Klobuchar replied, \u201cYou know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re fighting for regular people.\u201d\n\nThe exchanges between Warren and several of the candidates weren\u2019t the only contentious moments of a three-hour marathon debate featuring 12 presidential hopefuls. A heated exchange over how the U.S. should extract itself from the conflict in Syria between Buttigieg and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) offered a stark contrast between the two military veterans on the stage.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump shocked the international community last week after his surprise removal of U.S. troops stationed on Syrian border triggered an immediate invasion from Turkey, whose forces slaughtered Kurdish fighters who have fought alongside U.S. troops against ISIS for years. The action drew condemnation from both sides of the aisle, and was viewed as a betrayal of a vulnerable ally.\n\n\u201cWe need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution,\u201d Gabbard said.\n\nButtigieg replied Gabbard was \u201cdead wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it is a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d he said. \u201cOK, I didn\u2019t think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan, but it\u2019s also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we\u2019re seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201c We\u2019ve got to level with people\u2026 Tell people what it\u2019s going to cost, how you\u2019re going to do it, and why you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade. \u201d \u2014 Joe Biden\n\nBut time and time again, the debate returned to Warren\u2014and at times Sanders\u2014and their collective visions for America. The Massachusetts Democrat was taken to task for her call to break up the major tech giants, with several candidates saying they understood the idea in principle but thought it was ill conceived or impractical. Former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-TX) called it Trumpian for a politician to single out individual companies like Warren had done.\n\nLater in the debate, Warren\u2019s competitors went after her for being overly partisan and overly audacious. Biden said her pitch for structural political change, while attractive to \u201ca lot of people,\u201d was ultimately unrealistic.\n\n\u201c[Y]ou know, Senator Warren said we can\u2019t be running any vague campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to level with people\u2026 Tell people what it\u2019s going to cost, how you\u2019re going to do it, and why you\u2019re going to do it. That\u2019s the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.\u201d\n\nBy that point, Warren seemed to have gotten her footing a bit more. And when she pointed out that she had dreamed up and ultimately helped pass the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014an agency designed to shield consumers from corporate malfeasance\u2014Biden nearly exploded with exasperation.\n\n\u201cI got votes for that bill,\u201d Biden said. \u201c I convinced people to vote for it, so let\u2019s get those things straight, too.\u201d\n\nWarren paused and then said carefully, \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did a hell of a job in your job,\u201d Biden replied.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Warren, responded, sounding a little surprised.", "description": "Now leading the polls, the Massachusetts Democrat took heat from all sides Tuesday night\u2014and her opponents were no longer content to let her dodge the tough questions.", "authors": ["Jackie Kucinich", "Washington Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571197127/191015-debate-wrap-tease-2_ofztjy", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
