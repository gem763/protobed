He said they also wanted Ukraine's cooperation in investigating whether Democratic National Committee's email servers were in Ukraine. They also were looking at levels of assistance European nations were providing to Ukraine, he said.\n\nMulvaney denies there was a quid pro quo and says \"we do that all the time with foreign policy.\"\n\nHe pointed to the example of the administration holding up aid to Central American countries to force them to change their policies on immigration.\n\nTrump ultimately released nearly $400 million in military and other aid to Ukraine.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House is acknowledging that President Donald Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate his country's role in meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
