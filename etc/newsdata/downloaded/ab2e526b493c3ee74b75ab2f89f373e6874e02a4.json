The region is also home to the Chiquitano dry forests, where many indigenous communities typically supportive of Morales have lived for hundreds of years.\n\nAwe-inspiring.

Morales has rejected this idea on the grounds that it could \u201cinvite foreign meddling in a sovereign issue.\u201d\n\nThe issue may prove crucial in the country\u2019s presidential election this month, where Morales may be forced into a second-round runoff against his rival Carlos Mesa, himself a former president. Despite being a member of the Revolutionary Left Front (RFI), Mesa is widely seen as more business-friendly and a less radical version of Morales, who has allied the country with authoritarian regimes around the world such as Cuba, Iran, and China.\n\nAddressing the United Nations General Assembly last month, Morales affirmed his government\u2019s commitment to dealing with the forests, while also raising the alarm on the issue of climate change.\n\nThe consequences of climate change will condemn, according to data from our organization [the United Nations], millions of people to poverty, hunger, no potable water, losing their homes, forced displacement, more refugee crises and new armed conflicts. In recent weeks, fires have broken out in Bolivia, which we have been fighting against using our financial, technical and human resources. To date, our country has spent more than $15 million to mitigate fires.\n\nBrazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has so far taken most of the flak for his supposed lack of response to the fires, with liberal and left-wing media outlets using it as an opportunity to undermine the economic and agriculture policy of his conservative government.\n\n\u201c[Bolsonaro and his Environmental Minister Ricardo Salles] have not merely permitted these devastating fires, but have encouraged and fueled them,\u201d Guardian columnist David Miranda recently bemoaned, without making any reference to Morales. \u201cThey have done so with a toxic brew of radical ideology, political corruption and banal greed. Put simply, the ongoing destruction of the Amazon is taking place because of policy choices made by those who now rule Brazil.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Thousands of people took to the streets in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz on Sunday to protest against far-left President Evo Morales.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Bolivia-protesting-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
