All three were taken to hospital.\n\nHe declined to comment on what might have caused the vessel to tip over as it transported cars.\n\n\u201cOperations will now shift fully to environmental protection, removing the vessel and resuming commerce,\u201d USCG tweeted.\n\nHelicopters rescued 20 crew members from the 656-foot (200-meter) Golden Ray on Sunday after it became disabled, began listing and eventually fell helplessly on its side in St. Simons Sound, near Brunswick, Georgia, the Coast Guard said in a statement.\n\nThe ship had previously called at the Port of Brunswick and was headed to Baltimore, according to the Vessel Finder website. The carrier was built in 2017 and was sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands, it said.", "description": "Rescue workers on Monday freed the final crew member trapped inside a South Korean cargo vessel that flipped on its side off the coast of Georgia, the U.S. Coast Guard said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
