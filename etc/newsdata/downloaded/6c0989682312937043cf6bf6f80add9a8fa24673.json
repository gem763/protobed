How\u2019d it go? Very, very mixed.\n\nThe numbers were broadly better than expected \u2014 more than half of companies reported better revenue numbers than expected, while three-fourths of companies reported better profit numbers than expected. But, the beats weren\u2019t very compelling, and things are slowing \u2014 the market\u2019s revenue growth rate in Q2 2019 was the slowest since Q3 2016, while the profit growth rate was negative.\n\nBroadly, then, it wasn\u2019t a great earnings season. But, it wasn\u2019t an awful one, either.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHaving said that, the second-quarter earnings season was awful for a handful of stocks, which bucked the broader market trend and reported worse-than-expected second-quarter revenues and profits. Many of these stocks were hammered, considering the sentiment backdrop during Q2 wasn\u2019t great.\n\nWhich stocks got killed this earnings season? And will they remain in a downtrend for the foreseeable future?\n\nLet\u2019s answer those questions by taking a deeper look at seven stocks that flopped this earnings season \u2014 all of them are down more than 20% since they reported earnings \u2014 and see whether these stocks have any bounce-back potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorst Stocks That Flopped This Earnings Season: Ulta (ULTA)\n\nWorst Stocks That Flopped This Earnings Season: Ulta (ULTA) More\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nLoss Since Earnings Report: 30%\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a kind earnings season for retailers, as trade war woes broadly weighed on management sentiment and resulted in depressed back-half 2019 outlooks. But, for cosmetics retailer Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA), the second-quarter earnings season was particularly ugly.\n\nIn late August, Ulta reported second-quarter numbers that missed everywhere. The headline revenue and earnings numbers both missed expectations. Comparable sales growth in the quarter came up shy of estimates. Margins fell short of estimates, too. The full-year revenue growth, comparable sales growth, margin and profit guides were all cut in a big way \u2014 to well-below consensus marks.\n\nIn response to the across-the-board miss quarter, ULTA stock plunged \u2014 by about 30%. It now trades at its lowest levels since Christmas Eve 2018, when the broader indices were flirting with bear market territory.\n\nCan the stock rebound from these depressed levels? I think so. The secular growth drivers in the cosmetics industry remain favorable, supported by Selfie Generation consumers who are obsessed with looking good. Ulta still dominates this industry. The only problem is that after several years of red-hot growth, the industry is cooling off in 2019. Historically speaking, such cooling off periods are never that big, and never last that long.\n\nAs such, the macro backdrop will improve here. Probably by 2020. When it does, Ulta\u2019s numbers will bounce back, and ULTA stock will rebound in a big way.\n\n\n\n\n\nUber (UBER)\n\nWorst Stocks That Flopped This Earnings Season: Uber (UBER) More\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nLoss Since Earnings Report: 28%\n\nRide-sharing giant Uber (NYSE:UBER) has been a public company for about three months now. Over those three months, not only did UBER not get an IPO honeymoon, but the stock has actually been through a tremendous amount of pain \u2014 headlined by the stock\u2019s huge plunge following its latest earnings report.\n\nIn early August, Uber reported second-quarter numbers that missed estimates across the board. The headline revenue and profit numbers missed Street estimates. So did bookings and monthly active platform consumers. Perhaps more importantly, top-line growth metrics (revenue growth, bookings growth and user growth) all slowed dramatically from Q1, while core platform margins actually deteriorated year-over-year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "With 99% of S&P 500 companies having reported numbers so far, it's safe to say that the second-quarter earnings season is essentially over.
