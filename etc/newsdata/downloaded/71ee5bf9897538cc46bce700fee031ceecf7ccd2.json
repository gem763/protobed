During the event, the family\u2019s now 7-year-old daughter, who is both biracial and has autism, poised with an actor dressed as Gru from \"Despicable Me.\"\n\nIt wasn't until months later that the parents of the young girl noticed a photo showing the character had formed an upside-down \u201cOK\u201d symbol just above her shoulder, according to the report.\n\nThe hand gesture, in which the thumb and forefinger form a circle to show everything is fine, is now widely associated with white supremacy and the far right when the hand is turned downward instead of upward.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe darker meaning dates to at least 2017, when message boards such as 4chan falsely promoted it as a hate symbol, claiming it represented the letters \u201cwp,\u201d for \u201cwhite power\u201d according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization. It quickly gained popularity among some members of the far right, who posted pictures of themselves making the gesture, the organization said.\n\nAfter the Zingers began digging into the matter, they happened upon a video taken at the same time as the picture, USA Today reported. The film showed the girl being gestured toward the character, who formed his hands into the symbol while she was standing beside him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA Universal Orlando Resort spokesman confirmed to FOX Business that the actor has since been fired.\n\n\"We never want our guests to experience what this family did,\" the spokesman said. \"This is not acceptable and we are sorry \u2013 and we are taking steps to make sure nothing like this happens again.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n", "description": "The hand gesture, in which the thumb and forefinger form a circle to show everything is fine,\u00a0is now widely\u00a0associated with white supremacy when the hand is turned downward instead of upward.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OhiPBrTkF7CUqovR5qOYRg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://d.yimg.com/hd/cp-video-transcode/1009217/e933adf5-f880-461c-b673-f919a3853408/3b3d0fc2-9df9-5b6f-9f98-379e26cea35a/data_3_0.jpg?s=a184b4841155bcf03449f879b50ef7fb&c=d946a3d5ecaaf3e844b74cf525290910&a=tripleplay4us&mr=0", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
