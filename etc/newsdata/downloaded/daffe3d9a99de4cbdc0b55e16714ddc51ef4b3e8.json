Firstly, there's the question of style: would you like a set that's feminine and floral, bright and striped, or geometric? Are you a follower of fashion brave enough to deck your bed in Ultra Violet? Or are you simply after a soothing neutral or pastel colour scheme?\n\nThen, of course, there's the material itself. Cotton is a popular choice, and 100 cotton is the most breathable and 'strokable' in texture. The thread count is used to judge the quality, and measures threads per square inch. Meanwhile, cotton \"fibre\" refers to the cotton used, and is an indicator of quality. The longer the cotton fibre, the better. Egyptian cotton is the most highly regarded.", "description": "An inviting bedding set may not only induce sweet dreams as you tuck yourself in after a long day:", "authors": ["Madeleine Howell", "Katie Russell", "Shane Watson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/interiors/2019/03/07/duvet-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqfTCWBQ5pcVqNtVYH0DiOst7rJt9chb1onbNPhCNv1iU.PNG?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-03-07"}
