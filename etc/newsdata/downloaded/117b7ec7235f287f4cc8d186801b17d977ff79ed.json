Over the course of the last few years, Suse put a strong emphasis on the OpenStack platform, an open-source project that essentially allows big enterprises to build something in their own data centers akin to the core services of a public cloud like AWS or Azure. With this new strategy, Suse is transitioning away from OpenStack . It\u2019s ceasing both production of new versions of its OpenStack Cloud and sales of its existing OpenStack product.\n\n\u201cAs Suse embarks on the next stage of our growth and evolution as the world\u2019s largest independent open source company, we will grow the business by aligning our strategy to meet the current and future needs of our enterprise customers as they move to increasingly dynamic hybrid and multi-cloud application landscapes and DevOps processes,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe are ideally positioned to execute on this strategy and help our customers embrace the full spectrum of computing environments, from edge to core to cloud.\u201d\n\nWhat Suse will focus on going forward are its Cloud Application Platform (which is based on the open-source Cloud Foundry platform) and Kubernetes-based container platform.\n\nChances are, Suse wouldn\u2019t shut down its OpenStack services if it saw growing sales in this segment. But while the hype around OpenStack died down in recent years, it\u2019s still among the world\u2019s most active open-source projects and runs the production environments of some of the world\u2019s largest companies, including some very large telcos. It took a while for the project to position itself in a space where all of the mindshare went to containers \u2014 and especially Kubernetes \u2014 for the last few years. At the same time, though, containers are also opening up new opportunities for OpenStack, as you still need some way to manage those containers and the rest of your infrastructure.\n\nThe OpenStack Foundation, the umbrella organization that helps guide the project, remains upbeat.\n\n\u201cThe market for OpenStack distributions is settling on a core group of highly supported, well-adopted players, just as has happened with Linux and other large-scale, open-source projects,\u201d said OpenStack Foundation COO Mark Collier in a statement. \u201cAll companies adjust strategic priorities from time to time, and for those distro providers that continue to focus on providing open-source infrastructure products for containers, VMs and bare metal in private cloud, OpenStack is the market\u2019s leading choice.\u201d\n\nHe also notes that analyst firm 451 Research believes there is a combined Kubernetes and OpenStack market of about $11 billion, with $7.7 billion of that focused on OpenStack. \u201cAs the overall open-source cloud market continues its march toward eight figures in revenue and beyond \u2014 most of it concentrated in OpenStack products and services \u2014 it\u2019s clear that the natural consolidation of distros is having no impact on adoption,\u201d Collier argues.\n\nFor Suse, though, this marks the end of its OpenStack products. As of now, though, the company remains a top-level Platinum sponsor of the OpenStack Foundation and Suse\u2019s Alan Clark remains on the Foundation\u2019s board. Suse is involved in some of the other projects under the OpenStack brand, so the company will likely remain a sponsor, but it\u2019s probably a fair guess that it won\u2019t continue to do so at the highest level.", "description": "Suse, the newly independent open-source company behind the eponymous Linux distribution and an increasingly large set of managed enterprise services, today announced a bit of a new strategy as it looks to stay on top of the changing trends in the enterprise developer space.
