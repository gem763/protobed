Brinkley\u2019s 21-year-old daughter is set to replace her for the rest of the competition.\n\nWilliams chimed in Monday by telling viewers on her show that the injury \u201clooked fake as hell.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what I see. What I see is a 65-year-old hot stuff who looks like if you\u2019re going to fracture anybody you should\u2019ve said the tailbone \u2019cause I don\u2019t see a wrist and a shoulder being fractured. But that was real cute,\u201d said Williams.\n\nBrinkley didn\u2019t appreciate Williams\u2019 unfounded theorizing, however, and told People later Monday that she was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d at the talk show host\u2019s commentary \u201cbecause I have been there for Wendy Williams.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is so weird,\u201d she told the publication. Then, bursting into tears, she said: \u201cI have to give her a call. \u2026 I\u2019m really stunned.\u201d\n\nEXCLUSIVE ballroom bombshell! @SeaBrinkley is out of @DancingABC before the season begins. She tells @Ginger_Zee about her injury and the moment she called her daughter Sailor to ask her to step in for mom coming up on @GMA! #DWTS https://t.co/vCu1GI9DWR pic.twitter.com/SBDoWy84Aq \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) September 16, 2019\n\nWilliams went into detail about her conspiracy theory on Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show,\u201d speculating that Brinkley got invited on the show, agreed to do it, and then \u201cplotted her schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, I think what Christie did was she signed up for \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 knowing that she\u2019d put her daughter Sailor in there,\u201d said Williams, who described Brinkley\u2019s daughter as \u201ca Sports Illustrated model, but that\u2019s not as big as being, like, a Kendall Jenner.\u201d\n\nThe host went on to say that Brinkley put her daughter in her place to \u201cget this leg up\u201d because \u201c\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 has got a lot of eyeballs watching.\u201d\n\nShe elaborated:\n\nChristie doesn\u2019t really need that. You know who she is from the beginning to the end. She doesn\u2019t have to dance with the stars, you know, for you to know who she is. So my thought is that she said, \u201cLook, Sailor, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. I\u2019m going to go to a few of these practices. I\u2019m going to go on the \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 and line it with everybody else, get all the press and stuff, you know? I\u2019m going to walk around looking hot and sexy. And then I\u2019m gonna play like I broke something.\u201d And she did break something. Allegedly.\n\nWilliams continued: \u201cAlthough, Christie, I must tell you, there wasn\u2019t a believing person in my entire ... meeting this morning. When I presented my case, everyone was like, \u2018Uh huh.
