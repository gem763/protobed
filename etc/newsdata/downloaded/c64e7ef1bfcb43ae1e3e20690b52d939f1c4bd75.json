Yet, later in the day when it's warmer, the holes appear dark, like they were turned off to keep cool.\"\n\nBy examining fossils and 3-D images of Tyrannosaurus rex's skull, the scientists discovered that the dinosaur had similar holes.\n\nIn the past, scientists believed the two large features in the roof of the extinct predator's skull - called the dorsotemporal fenestra - were filled with muscles that assist with jaw movements.\n\nBut Casey Holliday says: \"It's really weird for a muscle to come up from the jaw, make a 90-degree turn, and go along the roof of the skull.\n\n\"Yet, we now have a lot of compelling evidence for blood vessels in this area, based on our work with alligators and other reptiles.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption T. rex appears to have had similar structures in its skull\n\nLarry Witmer, a professor of anatomy at Ohio University, who was also involved with the study, commented: \"We know that, similarly to the T. rex, alligators have holes on the roof of their skulls, and they are filled with blood vessels.\n\n\"Yet, for over 100 years we've been putting muscles into a similar space with dinosaurs. By using some anatomy and physiology of current animals, we can show that we can overturn those early hypotheses about the anatomy of this part of the T. rex's skull.\"\n\nCasey Holliday added: \"If you're an active predator, as we think T. rex probably was, at some point, you want to be able to shed heat, as much as you want to gather heat.\n\n\"Having a bed of capillaries (small blood vessels) up here in the skull roof provides a mechanism for these types of animals to collect heat or shed heat.\"\n\nThe findings have been published in the Anatomical Record.\n\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "description": "Two holes in the mighty predator's head may have helped it lose heat, according to scientists.", "authors": ["Paul Rincon", "Science Editor", "Bbc News Website"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/60BA/production/_108626742_mediaitem108626741.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
