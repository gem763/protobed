Part of Square's challenge is doing due diligence on each merchant \u2014 because the CBD industry is so new, there's no way to automate that process, so it requires \"a lot of eyeballs,\" Whiteley said.\n\nRead more: CBD companies were courted hard by a unit of US Bank \u2014 but they got ghosted despite having a 100% legal business\n\nPayment processors, in short, handle credit- and debit-card transactions on behalf of companies that sell their products online. They take a fee for each transaction. A new booming industry like CBD could provide a windfall for Square, since most other large payment platforms do not accept CBD companies.\n\nSquare is pushing into an industry in which there are not many ways for young companies to safely process payments, Whiteley said. Elavon, US Bank's payment-processing subsidiary, pulled out of the CBD industry in May over what the company said was the lack of clarity around CBD's legality in the US, Business Insider previously reported.\n\nHemp-derived CBD \u2014 containing less than 0.3% THC, the chemical responsible for the \"high\" associated with marijuana \u2014 was legalized in December through the Farm Bill. Each state has its own rules guiding the industry, however.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the CBD industry, Whiteley said launching Square's service to CBD merchants took an effort across the company's sales, risk, product, and compliance teams.\n\n\"We had to understand the general legal and regulatory landscape,\" Whiteley said, which involved conducting \"enhanced due diligence\" on CBD sellers compared with merchants in other industries.\n\nOnce Square put together a program on its due-diligence process, Whiteley had to \"shop it around\" to its payment partners \u2014 credit-card companies \u2014 to make sure that \"everyone was on board.\"\n\nOnce Square got everything aligned, they rolled out the closed beta program in March.\n\n\"That was an interesting experience because we saw how much demand there was outside of the beta for credit card processing,\" Whiteley said.\n\nA worker adds CBD oil to a drink at a coffee shop. Associated Press\n\nSolving the biggest pain points for CBD startups\n\nFor CBD merchants, Square's entrance into the industry will smooth over a lot of the headaches they faced while trying to build their businesses.\n\nDespite selling what's ostensibly a legal product, most online CBD sellers have been forced to turn to high-risk payment processors that are often based overseas and charge exorbitantly high fees.\n\nThese payment processors charge fees upward of 10% per transaction and often hold the funds for weeks, CBD sellers previously told Business Insider, whereas most noncannabis-related e-commerce businesses are charged in the 3% range, and the funds are dispersed immediately.\n\nRead more: Square has started working with a select group of CBD startups while other payments rivals shy away from the trendy substance\n\nApart from the higher fees, companies that use overseas payment processors are sometimes forced to set up companies abroad, and customers' credit cards often get flagged, adding an additional headache for entrepreneurs, CBD sellers previously told Business Insider.\n\nSquare, for its part, is charging 3.9% plus a 10 cent fee for each in-store credit-card transaction, and 4.2% plus a 30 cent fee for online transactions. While higher than other e-commerce businesses, Whiteley said this price reflected the added due diligence Square must conduct to onboard new CBD sellers.\n\nAs part of the rollout, Square will also provide payroll and inventory-management services to CBD sellers. On that front, Square has some competition.\n\nShopify rolled out its online platform for CBD sellers in September, though payments are contracted out to a third-party processor.\n\nPayment processing is just one of the myriad ways that CBD sellers \u2014 startups in an ostensibly legal industry \u2014 face specific challenges.
