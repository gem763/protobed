Someone alert the House GOP.\"\n\nFound my emails at the Venice Biennale.

The remark was often attributed to Clinton opposers who were searching for a way to offset the latest negative news about Trump.\n\nClinton was reportedly already in Italy to attend an economic forum.\n\nIn a statement provided to the Hill, the curatorial team said \u201cThe exhibition is a way to allude to an alternative world that will never exist. We are happy that the real Hillary Clinton has been part of this image full of possibilities.\n\n\"The exhibition is indeed the portrait of a powerful woman, but also the portrait of a historical change in our understanding of notions such as transparency, propaganda, public and private space,\u201d they also said.\n\nContributing: William Cummings, USA TODAY\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Hillary Clinton leafs through her emails at Italian art exhibit", "description": "The former Democratic presidential candidate flipped through thousands of her emails at the art exhibit in Venice, Italy.
