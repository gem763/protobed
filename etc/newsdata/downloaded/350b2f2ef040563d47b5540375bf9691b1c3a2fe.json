Eventually, someone\u2019s device will end up in the wrong hands.\u201d\n\nRead more: Colleges and universities are tracking potential applicants when they visit their websites, including how much time they spend on financial aid pages\n\nSmartphones contain texts, emails, bank accounts, and other sensitive information we might not even think about, like GPS data. According to Ernst, performing a factory reset on your phone is only one part of a three-step process you should be doing to protect your data if you trade in a phone, or sell any device.\n\nHe says that a factory reset removes pointers to files containing this data, but not the data itself.\n\n\u201cAnyone can use free, open-source tools to interrogate devices and find files that no longer have pointers associated with them,\u201d Ernst said.\n\nNot all phones are equally vulnerable, and issues differ depending on manufacturer, operating system, and carrier.\n\nsource Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nHow to wipe your phone\n\nErnst says that wiping the phone should be a three-step process:\n\n1. Erase your data\n\n2. Validate that the data was erased\n\n3. Get a report on the erasure.\n\nAccording to Ernst, consumers need to interrogate the services they use to trade in their phones. Ernst advises people trading in their phones to ask the company that they\u2019re working with if it\u2019s following that protocol. Consumers should ask \u201cHow can I trust that my phone is truly sanitized?\u201d and \u201cAre you validating that there\u2019s no data left?\u201d\n\nHe predicts that there will be an influx of people looking to trade in their phones as 5G becomes widely adopted, because phones will be more expensive and people will need to sell their old phones to afford the latest models.\n\nHowever, Ernst also notes that people are reluctant to trust third-party sellers with their phones, which contain so much personal data. Recognized brands like Apple will likely see an influx of trade-ins because they already have customers who trust them, he said.", "description": "Business Insider - Trading in older smartphones is one way for consumers to afford new models.
