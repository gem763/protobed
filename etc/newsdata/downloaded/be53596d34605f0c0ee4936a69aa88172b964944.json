'And I hope he will adjust his policies like he did before. That would actually be a sign of real leadership.'\n\n'If I hear the president say one more time, 'I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,' I'm going to throw up,' the Republican senator from South Carolina added.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham said he hasn't spoken to President Trump since he decided to remove U.S. troops from Syria\n\nPresident Trump has defended his decision: 'USA should never have been in Middle East'\n\nTrump's decision has led to criticism from members of both parties that he abandoned America's Syrian Kurdish allies under pressure from Turkey.\n\nThe president defended the move, writing on Twitter 'it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars.'\n\nHe also noted in a tweet Wednesday morning: 'Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending!\n\nGraham said he heard about Trump's decision when he got a phone call from someone at 6 a.m. on Monday, telling him: 'You won't believe what just happened.'\n\nThe senator has not spoken to Trump since.\n\n'He knows how I feel,' said Graham, who publicly criticized the president's decision.\n\n'The president is not ending the war. He's creating a bigger war if he does not change course,' Graham told Axios.\n\n'The president's doing this completely against everybody else's advice,' he said and claimed no one on the White House national security team supports the move.\n\nThe two men are close and often golf together. They played together on the last Saturday in September at the Trump National Golf Course in Virginia. Graham also traveled with Trump to New York in August for a series of Republican fundraisers.\n\nGraham is not the only Republican critic of Trump's decision, which has caused chaos in the region and fears of a Turkish military assault on the Kurds.\n\nTrump, however, said he would retaliate if Turkey did something the U.S. did not like.\n\n'I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey,' he warned via Twitter.\n\nSenator GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, Republican Senator Mitt Romney and GOP Congressman Adam Kinzinger also have been vocal critics of Trump's decision.\n\nTrump and Graham are close and often play golf together - Graham is seen at the White House after playing with the president in September\n\nPresident Trump and Senator Graham at the White House, leaving to play golf last October\n\nPresident Donald Trump greets Sen. Lindsey Graham and Sen. Chuck Grassley as they meet to discuss immigration at the White House in January 2018\n\nAnother Republican senator said Trump's move was reminiscent of President Barack Obama removing U.S. troops for Iraq.\n\n'Abandon our allies makes a crummy bumper sticker,' the lawmaker complained.\n\n'We just spent eight years fighting a cut-and-run foreign policy but this Syria decision is exactly what Obama did in Iraq. With the exception of one twerp, there's not a single Republican senator who ran on isolationism. You can campaign on not being the world's policeman all you want, but 'abandon our allies' makes a crummy bumper sticker and an even worse foreign policy because the fight against radical Islam isn't over, and some ISIS-type group will come back,' the senator told The Dispatch.\n\nTurkish troops crossed into Syria on Wednesday in preparation for an imminent attack on Kurdish territory, an official has claimed.\n\nTurkey-backed members of Syrian National Army prepare for moving to Turkey for an expected military operation by Turkey into Kurdish areas of northern Syria\n\nTwo expeditionary forces entered Syria close to the towns of Tell Abaid and Sari Kani early in the morning in preparation for a broader offensive, the official told Bloomberg.\n\nAnother official later denied that the military operation had begun, but said preparations are still underway.\n\nOn Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said his country will inform Syria, the United Nations and others about an expected Turkish incursion into northern Syria.\n\nHe argued the foray is in line with Turkey's right to defend itself.\n\nAnd Ibrahim Kalin, an aide to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, told National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien in a phone call that Turkey's operation aimed to clear its border of militants and ensure the return of Syrian refugees, local broadcaster NTV reported, according to Reuters.\n\nKalin and O'Brien also discussed a planned visit by Erdogan to Washington next month, NTV said.", "description": "Lindsey Graham says he hasn't spoken to Donald Trump since the president decided to remove U.S. troops from\u00a0Syria, a decision the senator says will put both the nation and Trump's presidency at risk.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/13/19490948-0-image-a-16_1570625328283.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
