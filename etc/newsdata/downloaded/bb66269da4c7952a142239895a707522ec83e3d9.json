This state is used to wind\u2014the most infamous have names: Diablo in the north, Santa Ana in the south. But the National Weather Service in San Francisco has already hailed the force and duration of this weekend\u2019s event, predicted to last until Monday, as \u201cpotentially historic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand just how severe this weekend\u2019s event is going to be,\u201d said Dr. Craig Smith, a fire scientist at Jupiter Intelligence and former employee of embattled utility company, PG&E. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be the strongest offshore wind event of the season...The models we\u2019re seeing now [are] already showing that this event is going to be about as strong as the Oct. 8, 2017 event that led to the northern California firestorm.\u201d\n\nThe weekend gales come on the heels of two other major wind events. Earlier this week, utility companies Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric, and SoCal Edison initiated a series of power shut offs across California for a strong gust beginning Wednesday night into Thursday, impacting roughly 218,000 people. Two weeks before that, PG&E staged its largest and most controversial outage this fire season, cutting power to nearly 740,000 customers in 35 counties.\n\nThe latest winds outdo those in scale\u2014the intense speeds are not confined to high ridges, like the sparsely populated areas of the North Bay and the Sierra Foothills, but will mix down to the urban centers, where vastly more people live. Thursday, PG&E, which services some 16 million people in California, announced it might shut off nearly its entire northern grid this weekend. As of Saturday morning, some 940,000 residents lost power from PG&E alone.\n\nThe outages have become a source a profound ambivalence in California, with some calling de-energization a necessary precaution against wildfire, as others\u2014facing food spoilage, accessibility issues, and even evacuation\u2014see it as a safety measure designed primarily for the utilities themselves.\n\n\u201cI basically stay clear of any political or corporate bs but this pg&e outage crap is pretty ridiculous considering both of the main power lines that go to our house are not only going thru a tree but are also completely flush with the trees bark and rubbing, [sic]\u201d an apparent PG&E customer named Meagan JoAnn wrote on Facebook, alongside pictures of the lines. \u201cI would love to know who has \u2018checked our lines for safety before turning the power back on?!\u2019 They have been like this for years. Recently they came and butchered the crap out of the tree but the lines are still rubbing. Here goes another outage potentially followed by another this weekend. Good thing I love my home cause I\u2019m not a fan of this state and it\u2019s public utilities companies!\u201d\n\nThe state-wide skepticism stems from a bankruptcy filing earlier this year by PG&E, after investigators found the utility liable for the series of fires that devastated California in 2017. The finding put PG&E at the center of several class action and negligence lawsuits over the disasters, including the notorious Camp fire, which leveled the town of Paradise, killing 85 people and destroying 19,000 structures\u2014the most damaging fire in California history. Their bankruptcy filing, the largest of its kind, left residents fuzzy on whether the utilities acted out of concern for public safety or private greed.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has taken a strong stance against the utilities, openly criticizing the shutoffs and infrastructure failures that rendered them necessary. Thursday, Newsom wrote an open letter to the leadership of all three utilities, claiming the outages \u201cundermined efforts to coordinate with first responders to protect public safety during these events.\u201d This week, he launched a program to mitigate the effects of power shutoffs, appropriating $75 million to fund local and state government investments in back-up generators, fuel storage and other emergency measures in public facilities.", "description": "JOSH EDELSONMiles above the Grand Basin, configurations of cool, high-pressure air have pushed dangerous gusts towards the California coast, triggering red flag weather warnings, mass power shutoffs, several wildfires, and thousands of evacuations from San Francisco to San Diego.
