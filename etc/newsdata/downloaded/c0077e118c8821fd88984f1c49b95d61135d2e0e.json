The wind and rain almost broke the TV feed, distorting the crisp, certain voice of Lady Hale to that of a Dalek.\n\nIt was fitting in its way. She spoke for 11 electrifying minutes but three words would have done. Exterminate. Exterminate. Exterminate.\n\nGame. Set. Match. Caught. Bowled. The Chequered Flag. The White Flag. The Towel. The Lot.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOn every single aspect, in every single way, the government was defenestrated with explosive force. It had been a unanimous verdict. All 11 supreme court judges were in agreement. No one expected that. And in every single element of the case, the government had been found entirely wanting.\n\nThree specific slam dunks punctuated the judgement, and each spread to fill a bizarre blast radius. The prime minister is in New York. Most of the rest of British politics is in Brighton, for the annual sacramental chanting at the Cult of Corbyn.\n\nThe technical issues had been resolved by the time the first one came. Even if they had not, visual clues of where Lady Hale might be heading were available.\n\nThe subject of her ladyship's penchant for elaborate brooches has been noted before in legal circles. Her \u201ctwelve best\u201d have even been the subject of a recent blog post on a law website.\n\nIt intimates that this morning\u2019s selection, which does not feature, had been purchased especially for the occasion \u2013 a giant sparkling black widow spider. It is one of many arachnids in which the function of the man in the circle of life is to be eaten alive by the woman.\n\nAs Kipling noted, the female of the species is more deadly than the male.\n\n\u201cThe first question is whether the lawfulness of the prime minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty is justiciable,\u201d Lady Hale paused. \u201cThis Court holds that it is.\u201d\n\nIf the Brighton Centre had gasped in any more perfect unison it would have sucked the sea through its own front door.\n\nWas this whole prorogation thing actually any of the court\u2019s business? Wasn\u2019t it just up to the government? That was the first question the court has been to asked to consider. It had made its decision. Supreme court 1. Government 0.\n\nShe carried on.\n\n\u201cThis was not a normal prorogation ... No justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court.\u201d\n\nMore deep breaths.\n\n\u201cThe Court is bound to conclude that the decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\u201d\n\nJaws dropped. Eyes widened. The TV pictures were crisp and immaculate now. Had Humberto himself stopped to listen in?\n\nOn she went. \u201cThis means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Its spokesperson cannot be reached for comment. It is not expected to return.\n\nIn the conference hall, Jeremy Corbyn rushed on to the stage. He reached for his usual staccato, to exalt somebody else\u2019s triumph.\n\n\u201cThis demonstrates a contempt for democracy and an abuse of power by Boris Johnson,\u201d he thundered, standing in the exact same spot where his own party has shown contempt for its own democracy 15 hours before.\n\n\u201cAnd I invite Boris Johnson to consider his position!\u201d\n\nThe crowd went wild. As it happens, outside the Supreme Court, the SNP MP Joanna Cherry was addressing the media. It was her who had brought the ultimately victorious case. The response of the Labour Party, Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition no less, had been to share some #OccupyParliament hashtags on Twitter and stage a late night sit in in the House of Commons.\n\nAll this as dawn broke over Manhattan. In his wilderness years, between winning the EU referendum and accidentally bringing down his own government, Dominic Cummings used to write lengthy blogs about \u201calternative branches of histories.\u201d It\u2019s not your fault if things go wrong, there are other, imagined worlds where things went right. It\u2019s just that, the branches are really very long now, the distance between them very wide indeed. The happy place is far, far away.\n\nMeanwhile, John Bercow strode out on to College Green, in front of the House of Commons.\n\n\u201cI have instructed the house authorities to prepare not for the recall \u2013 the prorogation was unlawful and is void \u2013 but to prepare for the resumption of the business of the House of Commons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe House of Commons sits tomorrow at 11.30am.\u201d\n\nEventually, Johnson emerged, to stand on a Manhattan balcony and, even at this impossible hour, lie, lie and lie again.\n\n\u201cI disagree with this judgement in the strongest possible way.\n\n\"We need to have a Queen\u2019s speech, that\u2019s what we want to do,\u201d he said, his hair blowing in the breeze, his face, as ever unable to fully de-smirk itself.\n\n\u201cBut there are a lot of people who want to frustrate Brexit.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s not about Brexit. But it is about Brexit. It was always about Brexit prime minister. You know it, we know it, the Supreme Court certainly knows it. Now, even The Queen knows it.\n\nAnd so, with his final flourish, Corbyn brought his leader\u2019s speech forward by a day. His deputy leader, Tom Watson, the man whose job he had tried to abolish three days previously, was bumped for the purpose.\n\nA fittingly premature end to an conference that should have been aborted before it began.\n\nIt had been a triumphant morning for the cause of truth and justice.\n\nYet there remains simply no occasion the Labour leadership cannot seek to lower to its level.", "description": "London was under the dying throes of Hurricane Humberto when the Supreme Court rose.
