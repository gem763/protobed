(One especially amusing example is his oblique reference in a later gun control opinion to John Paul Stevens\u2019s famous dissent in Citizens United, which spoke glowingly of a 1907 piece of legislation authored by the notorious racist Sen. Benjamin Tillman of South Carolina: \u201cTillman\u2019s contributions to campaign finance law have been discussed in our recent cases on that subject,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cHis contributions to the culture of terrorism that grew in the wake of Cruikshank had an even more dramatic and tragic effect.\u201d)\n\nThe idea that Thomas\u2019s belief in the persistence of racism should strike us as revelatory or even mildly surprising tells us more about Robin and his intended audience \u2014 and, no doubt, about certain right-wing pathologies \u2014 than it does about Thomas. Surely it would be more extraordinary if he actually agreed with his fellow justices, liberal and conservative alike, that, in the words of his colleague Brett Kavanaugh, a single 1986 case \u201cended the widespread practice\u201d of racial discrimination in the selection of jurors. Thomas knows better, not because he once typed up a manifesto for his Black Student Union, or even necessarily because he is black, but simply because he is honest.", "description": "", "authors": ["Matthew Walther", "Theweek.Com Articles What-Clarence-Thomas-Doesnt-Believe"], "top_image": ""}
