(AP) \u2014 Authorities say a 22-year-old man who fell to his death from a high-rise hotel balcony at a South Carolina beach had left a note for his napping mom that he was going to take pictures.\n\nHorry County Coroner Robert Edge says investigators are still trying to figure out how Jacob Matthews tumbled over the 42-inch (107-centimeter) railing Saturday at the Ocean Reef Resort in Myrtle Beach.\n\nEdge says Matthews and his mother just checked into the hotel and were staying on the 15th floor. The coroner told news outlets he can\u2019t say exactly which floor Matthews fell from.\n\nEdge says Horry County has about two or three fatal accidental falls from balconies each year and people need to be careful not to lean over or stand on chairs near railings.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Authorities say a 22-year-old man who fell to his death from a high-rise hotel balcony at a South Carolina beach had left a note for his napping mom that he was going to take pictures.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2014/06/10/ap210945194733_c0-387-4589-3062_s1770x1032.jpg?1cabab7b80613cc939717333784637f4191d0ec5", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
