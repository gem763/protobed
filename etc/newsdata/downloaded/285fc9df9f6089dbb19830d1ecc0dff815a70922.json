Bukit Timah Plaza, KAP Shopping Mall and Sime Darby Centre are also nearby, with amenities such as supermarkets, a movie threatre and eateries.\n\nSuccessful sales of properties along the same stretch include a home at 19 Yarwood Avenue, which sold for S$22.15 million in February this year and 21B Yarwood Avenue, which transacted for S$19.4 million in March 2018, said Knight Frank.
