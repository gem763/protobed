By doing so, we hope to help raise the largest amount in donations to date,' he said.\n\nDeliveroo has additionally pledged $100,000 to reward the first 5,000 fundraisers who raise and donate $20 or more to Polished Man with Deliveroo credit to the same value.\n\nThe food delivery service will also be encouraging riders to raise funds and will match every cent up to a further $10,000.\n\nPolished Meal will be available in Melbourne and Sydney via the Deliveroo app from October 9th for $20 whilst stocks last.", "description": "Australian food scientists have created a new edible nail polish that tastes like a full meal.
