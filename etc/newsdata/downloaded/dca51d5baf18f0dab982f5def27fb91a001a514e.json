Rust was playing in his first game this season after being injured in the final preseason game.\n\nBoth goals came from near the net against Ben Bishop, who stopped 24 shots.\n\nThe Penguins totaled only 11 shots on goal in the first two periods but outshot Dallas 16-3 in the third.\n\nOn the first goal, Bishop whiffed at clearing the puck from behind the net. Kahun passed out to Sam Lafferty, whose shot trickled under the supine Bishop. Kahun knocked the puck in from the right side at 7:29.\n\nPittsburgh Penguins' John Marino (6), Sam Lafferty (37), Matt Murray (30) and Jake Guentzel (59) celebrate their win over the Dallas Stars in an NHL hockey game in Dallas, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019.

Pittsburgh's Dominik Simon had a clear shot from the right faceoff circle, but it went off Bishop's chest.\n\nDallas had a flurry with seven minutes left in the second period, but Murray stopped a short-range shot by Alexander Radulov and a wrist shot by Justin Dowling after he had shot wide and retrieved the puck.\n\nNOTES: Penguins captain Sidney Crosby did not come out to begin the third period after being hit by a shot late in the second, but he returned within the first three minutes. ... Dallas Ds Esa Lindell and Taylor Fedun both left the ice for a time after pucks hit them in the face. Lindell had a cut below his nose, and Fedun was struck in the left cheek. ... Murray's 11th career shutout tied him with Les Binkley for the third-most in Penguins history.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPenguins: Return home to play Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nStars: Complete a four-game homestand on Tuesday against Minnesota.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nPittsburgh Penguins' Nick Bjugstad (27), Patric Hornqvist (72) and Bryan Rust (17) celebrate after Rust scored against the Dallas Stars in the third period of an NHL hockey game in Dallas, Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019.
