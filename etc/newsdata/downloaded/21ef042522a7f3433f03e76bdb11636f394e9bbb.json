Sony's planning on showing other games as well as part of the latest State of Play broadcast, so let's tune in.\n\nThe broadcast will kick off at 0600 AEST / 0530 ACST / 0400 AWST / 0800 NZST tomorrow morning, although it'll be broadcast through the official PlayStation Twitch account, Twitter, and Facebook pages as well.\n\nAn official release from Sony Australia says that the broadcast will run for approximately 20 minutes, which should be enough for at least seven or eight games (factoring in that Last of Us 2 will probably run for about half that time). Current speculation is that we'll get some kind of news about a multiplayer beta as well.\n\nI'd be surprised if we didn't see a little bit about Medievil as well, although I wouldn't expect it to be a whole lot. Death Stranding got enough of Tokyo Game Show to itself, and doesn't need the extra promotion, but it'd be a good chance to show off a couple of PSVR games.\n\nWhat would you like to see from the State of Play \u2014 and what are you keen to see most from The Last of Us 2?", "description": "Here's a fun bonus for hump day: some new Last of Us 2 footage.
