Previous excerpts of the book, out today, described the singer-songwriter bingeing cocaine \u201cuntil I was absolutely certain there was no cocaine anywhere in the vicinity,\u201d often to the point of blacking out. But another passage of the book details cocaine\u2019s effect on John\u2019s sex life. \u201cI found it was an aphrodisiac, which is strange, because for most people it kills the erection side of things completely,\u201d he writes. \u201cNever a problem for me, I\u2019m afraid. Quite the opposite. If I took enough coke I could stay hard for days.\u201d\n\nJohn describes the \u201cfantasy\u201d of being on cocaine, which made him feel open to new things sexually. \u201cI did things on coke that I would never have had the courage to do or try if I hadn\u2019t been,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt takes all the inhibitions out of people. Even straight guys sometimes.\u201d And his new Hollywood home, which he moved into in 1975, proved to be the perfect setting. \u201cI mostly used the snooker room to seduce guys. Strip snooker!\u201d John admits. \u201cIt usually seemed to do the trick, especially after a couple of lines of coke.\u201d\n\nYet despite his self-described sex addiction, John \u201cwas never actually into fucking that much.\u201d So what would he do? \u201cI was an observer, a voyeur. I\u2019d kind of set up my perversion, have two or three guys doing things for me to watch,\u201d he writes. \u201cThat was where my sexual pleasure came from, getting a bunch of people who wouldn\u2019t normally have sex with each other, to have sex with each other.\u201d And that\u2019s not all. \u201cI just watched, took Polaroids, organized things,\u201d he continues. \u201cThe only problem was that I was incredibly houseproud, so they\u2019d end up having sex on the snooker table with me shouting, \u2018Make sure you don\u2019t come on the baize!\u2019 which tended to puncture the atmosphere a bit.\u201d You don\u2019t say!\n\nThere was, somehow, a benefit to all this, John claims. \u201cNot being that interested in having sex myself is the reason I never got HIV,\u201d writes the singer, who says later in the book that multiple ex-boyfriends became HIV-positive. \u201cIf I had been [having sex], I\u2019d almost certainly be dead.\u201d\n\nJohn finally gave up cocaine when he checked himself into rehab in 1990 \u2014 stars like Freddie Mercury and George Harrison, among many others, had told him to go for years, but he didn\u2019t listen until his ex-boyfriend, Hugh Williams, checked into rehab while they were dating. He kicked his cocaine addiction, along with his alcoholism, but he says cocaine still haunts him, particularly through a recurring dream. John writes, \u201cWhen I wake up, I can almost feel the numbing sensation of the coke sliding down the back of my throat \u2014 always the part of doing it that I hated \u2014 and I just think \u2018thank God that\u2019s over.\u2019\u201d", "description": "In his new memoir, \u201cMe,\u201d Elton John writes of how cocaine turned him on, and describes inviting men over to his Hollywood home to have sex in front of him.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-elton-john.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
