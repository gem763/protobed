The survey, of more than 3,000 adults, showed that 28 per cent are undecided.\n\nAndrew Harrop, general secretary of the Fabian Society, said: \"Private schools entrench inequality and Labour is right to seek to integrate private schools into the state system by removing their tax breaks and changing how universities select students.\n\n\"But private education cannot just be banned because that will breach the human rights which the Labour party rightly cherishes. Instead, Labour needs to make sure that private schools are not an attractive option for parents when compared to a brilliant system of state education.\u201d\n\nHowever, shadow chancellor John McDonnell argued scrapping private school fees could boost the economy.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 5Live: \u201cWhat I think we\u2019ll find is that for the large number of people who would be, at the moment, spending money on private education, that money actually will go into the wider economy and stimulate the economy.\u201d\n\nBoth the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and Mr Corbyn attended private schools.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr Corbyn tweeted: \u201cEvery child deserves to get the very best education, no matter their background. A Labour government will end the privilege that is entrenched by private schools.\u201d\n\nMr Johnson has criticised Labour's plans to abolish private schools as being both expensive and \"pointless\u201d.\n\nThe Eton-educated prime minister has said it would cost \u00a37bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to educate all the pupils who would no longer be educated privately.\n\nHe also accused Mr Corbyn of \"unbelievable hypocrisy\" over the proposal, highlighting that the Labour leader, as well children of several Labour cabinet ministers, attended a private school.\n\n\" It's extraordinary that they've excavated this from the crypt of what I thought to be long buried socialist ideology,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nAsked if he thinks he would be PM if he had not been privately educated, Mr Johnson replied: \"I've been very fortunate in my life in all sorts of ways and I certainly owe a lot to my education.\"", "description": "Leaders of elite private schools have vented outrage over Labour\u2019s plan to abolish them, branding the policy \u201cincredulous\u201d [sic] and an \u201cact of unprecedented vandalism\u201d.
