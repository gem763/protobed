The purpose of the hydroponic device was to rapidly grow plants to exact specifications. Program the right amounts of water, nutrients, and light into the plastic box, and it would automatically grow plants up to four times faster than normal. The device had all the hallmarks of sugar-daddy science: It looked amazing, and nothing added up. As a crop scientist, I\u2019d worked in room-sized versions of this back in 2001, and the equipment was already dated by then. The speed gains its creators touted\u2014especially when the food computer wasn\u2019t as nearly as revolutionary or sophisticated as publicity made it out to be\u2014just didn\u2019t smell right.\n\nSure enough, the boxes did not function as promised, and news reports portray a Theranos-style deception. \u201cAhead of big demonstrations of the devices with MIT Media Lab funders, staff were told to place plants grown elsewhere into the devices,\u201d Business Insider reported. \u201cOne former researcher,\u201d declared a subsequent story in the The Chronicle of Higher Education, \u201cdescribed buying lavender plants from a gardening store, dusting the dirt off the roots so it looked as if they\u2019d been grown without soil, and placing them in the food computer ahead of a photo shoot. The resulting photos were sent to news media and put on the project\u2019s website.\u201d\n\nFull disclosure: When the Media Lab announced in 2017 that it was looking for innovators who didn\u2019t have a conventional research background, I applied. I\u2019d been working in the indoor-farm industry for years as a fixer; companies hired me for food-safety work, but then I wound up dealing with a range of brick-and-mortar problems that eluded the tech world\u2014things like cold-chain logistics, pest control, water chemistry, security, breaking production logjams, and keeping staff from getting electrocuted. Agricultural and food-systems design is my wheelhouse. The food computer is nice, I told the Media Lab. But if you really want to knock things loose, hire me.\n\nIt didn\u2019t. At the time, I didn\u2019t think much of not getting the job. Agriculture is an offbeat niche for MIT, and no doubt the Media Lab had many other applicants. I already had a thriving business. No harm, no foul.\n\nBut in recent weeks\u2014like many scientists who\u2019ve worked real-world problems adjacent to the Media Lab\u2014I\u2019ve been asking why someone like me isn\u2019t a good fit for high-profile science, but \u201cfood computer\u201d makers and convicted pedophiles are.\n\nThe Media Lab took sugar-daddy science to a new level. Epstein\u2019s interests in science, like a desire to \u201cseed the human race\u201d by impregnating dozens of women and to have his head and penis frozen after his death, were more literally sexual than most. But he didn\u2019t invent the hustle. It\u2019s an old philanthropy problem: Donor gratification takes precedence over results.", "description": "The pursuit of money from wealthy donors distorts the research process\u2014and yields flashy projects that don\u2019t help and don\u2019t work.", "authors": ["Sarah Taber", "Crop Scientist"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/AP_19252578044665/facebook.jpg?1568809105", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
