More importantly, Curry\u2019s Grocery Store, too. Some of the boats at Donny\u2019s Marina have been broken to matchsticks. Others lie on their sides in the middle of the street.\n\nThis barrier island off Great Abaco in the northern Bahamas was already a community apart. When Hurricane Dorian struck on Sunday, it was completely isolated.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t leave because we\u2019d been through other storms,\u201d said Craig Curry, 55. \u201cBut not this. This was nothing like we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nCurry spent two days battling Hurricane Dorian in his home. When howling winds blew the first window out, he nailed his dining room table to the hole. Two more windows exploded, and then his door. He took shelter in his basement.\n\n\u201cWe fought that storm for two days,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019re homeless. There\u2019s nothing left.\u201d\n\nGreen Turtle Cay is a tightknit community of about 500 people. Everyone here is family \u2014 either because they\u2019re related, or because they\u2019ve lived here together for so long.\n\n\n\nHurricane Dorian tossed boats on Great Abaco.

Islanders are struggling without power, without water, without a steady supply of food.\n\nThe Coast Guard staged rescues earlier Wednesday. Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and his World Central Kitchen nonprofit dropped off boxes of chicken and rice. The government sounded the all-clear, lifting storm warnings for the Abacos, Grand Bahama, Bimini and other battered islands.\n\nBut fear here is spreading.\n\n\u201cWe need tarps. We need medical supplies. We need more water. We need chain saws,\u201d said boat captain Rontonio Levarity, 35. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d\n\nLevarity\u2019s Mako yacht was smashed to pieces in the storm.\n\n\n\nThe storm flooded homes on Great Abaco.

The island came into view 25 minutes out of Nassau: the white sand beaches and turquoise waters of the northern half, largely spared Dorian\u2019s wrath. In the south, watery cays and island scrub show nature\u2019s blitzkrieg.\n\nMuch of the island is still flooded. Homes remain submerged. Inland brush has turned to marshland. There are forests of fallen trees.\n\nTravis Kelly, a 33-year-old boat captain, said gangs had robbed a store of guns in the hardware store and were looting and destroying homes.\n\n\u201cPeople are desperate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are robbing and looting, and no one is doing anything to stop them.\u201d\n\nMarsh Harbour lived off tourism. But the infrastructure has been flattened. Two power plants were crippled. The marinas, completely destroyed. Abacos Big Bird, the local chicken farm, was leveled.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fleet of 100 fishing boats, wrecked, on the streets,\u201d Kelly said. The water supply is contaminated with gasoline and feces.\n\nKelly said the apartment where he has been staying since his house was destroyed was robbed on Tuesday. Stolen were his cellphone, batteries, food, water.\n\nHis feet were cut and infected from days in flooded streets.\n\nHe said the community also pulled together, sharing food, water and shelter.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no curfew, because there is no one here to enforce it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re four days in and they are still \u2018assessing the situation.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSeventeen of the Bahamas\u2019 20 confirmed deaths from Dorian have been on the Abacos. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis described the losses: 60 percent of houses in Marsh Harbour damaged. The Mudd, a shantytown of Haitian workers, completely destroyed. The airport underwater.\n\nBut there was misery on other islands. The storm, which struck Sunday as a Cateogry 5 hurricane, spent 40 slow hours from Sunday to Tuesday grinding across Grand Bahama.\n\nThe death count was expected to rise as search efforts spread to more areas that were flattened by the storm.\n\nCoast Guard helicopters airlifted patients from the hardest-hit islands to medical facilities in Nassau, the capital. The British Royal Navy, aid groups and volunteers joined in rescue and relief efforts.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of destruction is catastrophic,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Kristopher Ensley, the captain of the 154-foot Coast Guard Cutter Paul Clark. \u201cIt\u2019s tragic.\u201d\n\n[This fisherman lost everything in Hurricane Dorian, including his wife]\n\nIn Nassau, spared the worst of the storm, concerned relatives gathered at the international airport in the hope of receiving loved ones evacuated from the northern islands \u2014 or, at least, word that they were okay.\n\nSandra Cooke has family living on cays near the Abacos. Communication has been difficult, she said, and their situation is dire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey, the prime minister, the authorities, aren\u2019t even talking about those keys, they haven\u2019t even flown over those cays. It\u2019s flat like the ground we\u2019re standing on.\u201d\n\nIn Freeport on Grand Bahama, 60-year-old Gail Woon described a \u201ctaxing\u201d night in a shelter. Someone opened a window, and the roof collapsed.\n\nWoon and the others there ran to a church \u2014 one of the few structures, she said, that didn\u2019t collapse or flood.\n\n\u201cBuildings here are only built to withstand 150-mph winds,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have no chance.\u201d\n\nWoon returned to her flooded home on Wednesday, to salvage what she could. A generator chugged power.\n\nShe had lived through Hurricanes Frances and Jeanne in 2004.\n\n\u201cThis was nothing like those,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was something that we never experienced before.\u201d\n\nMaria Sacchetti contributed from aboard the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Paul Clark in the Atlantic Ocean.
