I am living my dream!\", says Gajraj Rao who is overwhelmed with the kind of response he has been getting from the film industry.\n\nHe has been around in the industry for over twenty five years but Badhaai Ho has proved to be a game-changer for him in every sense of the word.\n\nToday, he is more secure and feels more established as an actor. Talking to TOI, Gajraj Rao admitted that he's grateful that a project like 'Badhaai Ho' happened. He said,\n\nDon't Miss 21.7 K SHARES 9.8 K SHARES 2.4 K SHARES 1 K SHARES 2.1 K SHARES\n\n\"Today, thanks to Badhaai Ho, I can choose my projects. Story, script, the director\u2019s temperament, and the producer, are elements that have now gained importance because releasing a film is as important as making it.\"\n\nHe admitted that before Badhaai Ho, he compromised on work and pay but now finally, things have changed. He said,\n\n\"In the pre-Badhaai Ho phase, I used to get work from friends, and at times, I have even worked for a much lower fee, or sometimes, no fee at all. From doing cameos, extended cameos and smaller supporting roles, I\u2019ve come to a point where people are willing to wait up to six months or a year for me. They\u2019re writing something with me in mind; my talent and performance are finally being appreciated.\"\n\nCurrently, he has some interesting projects in his kitty including pivotal supporting roles in Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, Maidaan and the upcoming Made In China.", "description": "Gajraj Rao says he is overwhelmed with the kind of response he has been getting from the film industry.
