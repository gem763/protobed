This differs from the offer to Bryce Harper last year, which featured payments lasting until 2052.\n\nHarper eventually signed with the Philadelphia Phillies on a 13-year, $330 million contract.\n\nThe Nationals could now face more pressure to re-sign Rendon, who is a legitimate MVP candidate after an outstanding 2019 season. The 29-year-old finished the year with a .319 batting average, 1.010 OPS, 34 home runs and 126 RBI, all of which were career highs.\n\nHe also led the National League in RBI and doubles (44) and helped Washington earn a wild-card spot.\n\nAs Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports recently noted, Rendon could top the eight-year, $260 million deal Nolan Arenado received from the Colorado Rockies if he hits free agency:\n\nThe key will be negotiating with multiple teams rather than accepting an extension like Arenado.\n\nWashington has done its best to lock down Rendon but has been unsuccessful to this point.\n\n\"We've had discussions throughout the year, and we've traded proposals back and forth,\" general manager Mike Rizzo said over the summer, per Mark Zuckerman of MASN. \"We haven't had a deal yet. We certainly would embrace if we can get a deal done. We certainly continue to talk, and we'll see where it leads us down the road.\"\n\nThe All-Star will now have to decide if the latest deal was enough to keep him on the roster.", "description": "The  Washington Nationals  reportedly offered third baseman Anthony Rendon a seven-year deal worth $210 million-$215 million in early September, according to  Barry Svrluga  of the  Washington Post ...", "authors": ["Rob Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/830/784/hi-res-f882da84a36e0c59c8bc907058a0bb1f_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
