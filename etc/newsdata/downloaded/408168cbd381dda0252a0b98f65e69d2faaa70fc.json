(AP) \u2014 It's hard to regard Ellie as a menace.\n\nWhen Greg Manteufel is frustrated or feeling down, she sits by him. At night, she sleeps under his covers. At dinner, she's there next to him, knowing he'll throw something her way. She belies the stereotype of the vicious pit bull.\n\n\"We love her like she's our daughter,\" he said of the dog.\n\nAnd yet, Ellie may be the reason Manteufel, 49, nearly died.\n\nGravely ill, he lost parts of his arms and legs, as well as the skin of his nose and part of his upper lip. The cause was capnocytophaga (cap-noh-seye-TOE'-fah-gah), a germ from Ellie's mouth or from another dog he encountered.\n\nCapnocytophaga is commonly found in the saliva of cats and dogs and almost never leads to people getting sick, unless the person has a compromised immune system. But Manteufel was perfectly healthy. In fact, he doesn't think he'd ever used his health insurance before he fell ill.\n\nThe case is extremely rare and doctors at his hospital, Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin, had no explanation for why he got so sick. But over the last 10 years there have been at least five other healthy people who have had severe reactions to the germ. A team of researchers connected with Harvard Medical School has developed a theory on why \u2014 a gene change in all the victims.\n\nAnd their finding means doctors can't rule out the capnocytophaga bacteria could strike Manteufel and other victims again.\n\n___\n\nGreg Manteufel thought he was getting the flu in June of 2018. He had a fever, vomiting and diarrhea. But when he started getting confused, his family took him to the hospital.\n\nDoctors did blood cultures and found capnocytophaga, which caused sepsis, a severe blood infection that led to his blood pressure dropping and many of his organs shutting down.\n\n\"Do what you have to, to keep me alive,\" he told the doctors.\n\nHe had so much to live for \u2014 foremost, his wife of 16 years, Dawn, and 26-year-old son, Mike. He was just starting to get really good at his day job, painting houses. He cherished his Harley Davidson Electric Glide. He was in the middle of fixing up his '66 El Camino. And of course there was Ellie, the pup.\n\nAnd so he persisted, through more than 20 surgeries, including amputations of his left and right arms just below the elbow, and legs through the middle of the knee.\n\nHis wife and son stayed optimistic, because he was.\n\n\"Greg said he didn't come this far to lay down and let this beat him,\" Dawn Manteufel said.\n\nHe was out of the in-patient rehab unit in about two weeks, learning to move from his wheelchair to the bed, toilet and car. The usual stay is three to four weeks, said Dr. David Del Toro, medical director for the inpatient rehab unit at Froedtert.\n\nManteufel made similar quick advances using his arm prosthetics and leg prosthetics.\n\n\"He does not seem like any other patient I've met before,\" Del Toro said. \"He's just, you know, full speed ahead.\"\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, connected to Harvard Medical School, as well as Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center had been investigating cases like his.\n\nThe team has done genetic testing on five otherwise healthy people who suffered capnocytophaga infections to see if they could find anything in common. They discovered all had a gene connected to the immune system that was working differently \u2014 a genetic variant.\n\n\"It was a really thrilling moment,\" said Elizabeth Fieg, a genetic counselor at Brigham and Women's Hospital. \"The stakes are so high with these cases and the patients have gone through so much.\"\n\nThey believe it makes those people more susceptible to developing severe medical problems from capnocytophaga. But they are also trying to determine if there are other risk factors.\n\nOf the five in the study, three survived with amputations and two did not. Fieg hopes their research can determine why some did not survive.\n\nShe also hopes if their theory is confirmed, it will help diagnose cases faster, and perhaps save lives and limbs.\n\nThat's why Greg Manteufel jumped at the chance to take part when he was approached in August.\n\nResearchers need to gather more evidence, but hope to publish their study in the next year to 18 months.\n\n___\n\nManteufel's life now includes frequent occupational therapy appointments to perfect his use of arm prosthetics \u2014 the kind with metal moveable hooks at the end. He's using a fork regularly and he's now working on picking up the TV remote, opening doorknobs, cutting vegetables and doing the dishes.", "description": "It's hard to regard Ellie as a menace.
