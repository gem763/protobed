On 18 August the European commission wrote to Theresa Villiers, expressing serious concerns and reminding the UK environment secretary that the content of the rigs\u2019 storage cells qualifies as hazardous waste, according to EU law.\n\nOf the five European countries extracting oil from the North Sea \u2013 Britain, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Norway \u2013 only Norway has come out in support of relaxing the rules for Shell\u2019s Brent structures.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m genuinely taken aback by this,\u201d said Jochen Flasbarth, a state secretary at the German environment ministry. \u201cWe usually collaborate very closely with the United Kingdom on environmental issues.\n\n\u201cBoth countries are gravely concerned about the state of our oceans \u2026 And then you just leave thousands of tonnes of contaminated water in the North Sea? I don\u2019t get it. That isn\u2019t consistent with an environmental policy that has advanced Britain\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nThe disagreement over the future of the rigs will come to a head at a special meeting on 18 October in London of members of Ospar, the mechanism by which 15 governments and the EU cooperate to protect the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic.\n\nSince the oil rigs are in British territory and Ospar does not have legal mechanisms to issue fines, the UK government could in theory risk ignoring the objections of the other states.\n\nWith a looming Brexit deadline in October and growing European distrust of Britain\u2019s inclination to meet outstanding obligations, the standoff may resemble the dynamics of the UK\u2019s negotiations to leave the EU.\n\nDisagreements over the handling of decommissioned oil infrastructure date back to 1995, when Shell proposed sinking the Brent Spar oil storage buoy. After protests by Greenpeace and petrol boycotts in Germany, Shell announced it would seek a more environmentally friendly solution.\n\nIn the wake of the debacle, the Ospar treaty was amended to ban the dumping of old installations or leaving them wholly or partly in place.\n\nBut in recent years British politicians and environmentalists have argued that the legal framework is out of date, and that removing old oil infrastructure could be more harmful than beneficial to the environment. A 2017 study by the Scottish Wildlife Trust made the case that rigs could become artificial reefs, providing valuable habitat for marine life.\n\nIn June, Shell removed the 25,000-tonne topside part of the Brent oil rigs. Removing the contentious contaminated sediment inside storage cells would \u201con balance\u201d be too costly and risky, it argues.\n\nGermany and the other EU member states say the remaining oil and pollutants are a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d that will eventually seep into the sea unless Shell removes them. \u201cPumping out all the oil and pollutants won\u2019t be a trivial undertaking, and it won\u2019t be cheap,\u201d said Flasbarth. \u201cBut experts say it is possible.\u201d\n\nA report commissioned by the German government says Shell\u2019s methodology is \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and contains a \u201chigh level of mathematical bias\u201d because it follows guidelines set by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).\n\nShell rejects these allegations. A spokeswoman said: \u201cOur recommendations are the result of 10 years of research, involving more than 300 scientific and technical studies. We established an independent group of scientific experts to review the findings and ensure all feasible decommissioning options were investigated thoroughly.\n\n\u201cWe submitted our recommendations following extensive stakeholder engagement and only when we were confident that they were safe, technically achievable, and environmentally and socially sound.\u201d\n\nA BEIS spokesperson said: \u201cDecommissioning is undertaken in accordance with UK and international obligations, in a safe and cost-effective manner while minimising risk to the environment.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups such as the Scottish Wildlife Trust, which has pioneered the rigs-to-reefs idea, have also questioned Shell\u2019s calculations.\n\nThe trust said in a letter to Shell: \u201cConsidering the oil and gas industry has built up decades of expertise in drilling and extracting oil and gas from deep beneath the seafloor, it seems the task of removing all the pollutants from the GBS [gravity-based structure] cells would be fairly straightforward.\u201d\n\nFlasbarth said: \u201cIf you look at the tax arrangement that the British government entered with Shell, it is obvious that the UK is now seeking the cheapest solution rather than the most environmentally friendly.\u201d", "description": "Germany leads complaint against plan to leave polluted remains of Shell rigs in place", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann", "Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feeca6b8204449a96b585d8ba9c51488b436de50/0_345_5596_3357/master/5596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8386ba735918de4d7e795d4357a3a0d"}
