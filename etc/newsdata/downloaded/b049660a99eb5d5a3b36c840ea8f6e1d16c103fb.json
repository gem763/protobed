Also, the SDF shot down a reconnaissance aircraft in the skies of \u201cQasr Deep\u201d in Malikiyah countryside.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an umbrella organization largely composed of YPG and YPJ units, the attacks have already cost the lives of eight civilians, including an infant and a ten-year-old boy.\n\nThe Governor of Duhok, Iraqi Kurdistan, told BasNews on Thursday that the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) is currently drawing up plans to take in thousands of Syrian-Kurds in need of refuge.\n\nThe KRG, an official autonomous community within Iraq, has long struggled to maintain friendly ties to the YPG and has diplomatic relations with Turkey. It has repeatedly asked the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a Marxist terrorist group that Turkey insists has ties to the YPG, to vacate Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nIn a bid to draw support, Syrian Kurdish officials hinted earlier this at possible dialogue with the Assad regime, with Badrian Jia Kur, a senior adviser to the Autonomous Administration of North and South Syria (NES), telling Reuters that officials were now forced to \u201cstudy all available options.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may hold talks with Damascus or the Russian side to fill the void or block the Turkish attack, so this may develop and there could be meetings and contacts in case of a vacuum,\u201d he explained.\n\nBashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in Damascus has shown little sympathy for the plight of Syria\u2019s Kurds, blaming their current predicament on a supposedly foolish decision to ally themselves with the U.S. against the Islamic State. Many Kurds feel betrayed by President Donald Trump following his decision to withdraw troops from the Turkish-Syria border. However, Damascus did warn Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stay out of Syrian territory.\n\n\u201cSyria condemns in strongest terms the reckless statements and hostile intentions of the Turkish regime and the military build-up at the Syrian borders which constitute an outrageous violation of the international law and a blatant breach of the International Security Council\u2019s resolutions which affirm respecting Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,\u201d the Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement via state media.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.", "description": "Over 60,000 civilians in northern Syria have been displaced during the first 36 hours of Turkey's invasion, a report alleged.", "authors": ["Ben Kew"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1164960401-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
