Between January and August this year, more than 25,000 people arrived by sea to the Greek islands \u2013 a 32 per cent rise compared to the same period in 2018, according to the United Nations.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A facility on the island of Lesbos that was designed to hold 3,000 is now housing more than 10,000. Others are also struggling.\n\nThe rise is being driven partly by a crackdown on Syrian refugees in Turkey and a spike in violence in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, but the majority of refugees and asylum seekers are coming from Afghanistan.\n\nSyrian refugees are under increasing pressure from host countries to return home, despite there being clear evidence that it is not safe to do so.\n\nHuman Rights Watch reported this month that a number of Syrians deported from Lebanon were arrested upon their return. The rights group said it had documented \u201carbitrary detentions, disappearances, and harassment in areas retaken by the government.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a devastating Russian and government offensive in Idlib has displaced tens of thousands of people in recent months.\n\nWith agencies", "description": "Ten Syrian refugees have been detained while trying to enter Greece disguised as a Ukrainian volleyball team, as the country struggles to deal with a new influx of asylum seekers. \u00a0 Greek police said the men were arrested at Athens airport on Sunday after it was discovered that the passports they were carrying had been reported lost or stolen.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/11/6ff5e4a1b6ca4162b642b8a16a455369-18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
