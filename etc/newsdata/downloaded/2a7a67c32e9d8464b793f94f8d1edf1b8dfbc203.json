He is a political dictator in the tradition of Lennon and Stalin and Mao.\u201d\n\nThe list of threats China poses to the United States is long, but near the top is its hijacking of technology, including worldwide domination gained by its global Huawei technology company and even on social media through its Tik Tok app.\n\n\u201cHuawei is probably the first great strategic defeat of the United States by the Chinese and the involvement of 5-G technology, which is the next generation of the Internet, and it\u2019s astonishing the gap between what they have done ironically with a corporation operating like a business on a worldwide basis,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cAnd you compare Huawei \u2014 there\u2019s no, zero American company competitive with Huawei today, and our bureaucracies, and our lobbyists and politicians and our systems simply cannot fathom how bad the defeat is becoming,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\nAnd Tik Tok also has global implications.\n\n\u201cTeenagers in America in effect [are] using a social tool that\u2019s being edited and controlled by the Chinese communists,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\nGingrich also spoke about what he called \u201ceconomic colonization,\u201d where the Chinese instead of using military might are using money to gain control of vital ports around the world, including in Sri Lanka and Italy.\n\nThe Chinese offer to build infrastructure needed in foreign lands in exchange for a Chinese presence.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad to do it,\u201d Gingrich said of the Chinese. \u201cAll we ask you to do is sign away your future.\u201d\n\nGingrich said that China\u2019s 5,000 years of history makes it take a longer view than the United States and, even with setbacks, China has its restoration as the world\u2019s most powerful nation as its goal.\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re back on track to once again be the middle kingdom and to have the natural duty of outer barbarians like us to pay recognition to their central importance and the brilliance of their civilization, and for them they\u2019re simply acting out the next phase of a 5,000 year history,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\nGingrich also reminded Breitbart Daily News listeners of China\u2019s horrific human rights record, including suppression of the freedom movement in Hong Kong, as many as a million religious minorities in concentration camps in western China, and continued efforts to crush Tibet and Falun Gong followers.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich issues a warning in his new book about the Chinese threat to the United States and the world.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/TEH-ENG-KOONFP-via-Getty-Images-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
