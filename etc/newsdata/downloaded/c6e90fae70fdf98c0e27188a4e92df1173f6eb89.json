REUTERS/Stephen Nellis\n\nMicron and Intel worked together starting in 2006 to bring to market what is called 3D cross-point memory technology. The technology uses three-dimensional features on storage chips to make them faster.\n\nMicron said a year ago that it would buy out Intel\u2019s share of the joint venture, called IM Flash Technologies, for $1.5 billion in cash and the assumption of $1 billion of Intel\u2019s share of the venture\u2019s debt. The deal will close this month, leaving Micron in full control of a factory built in Utah to make the chips.\n\nHard drives made with the new chips are faster than previous solid-state drives. That has captured the interest of data center owners carrying out computing jobs like deep learning, where artificial intelligence software ingests huge amounts of data to learn new tasks.\n\nIntel released a second generation of its version of the technology earlier this year. Micron is now jumping into the market, testing it with what a handful of customers.\n\n\u201cThis is just the very, very beginning,\u201d Micron Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra told Reuters at a launch event in San Francisco. \u201cThese kinds of technologies do take multiple years before are they broadly deployed.\u201d\n\nMicron launched its Intel competitor Thursday, a device it calls X100. The device itself is a hard drive that can be plugged directly into a server, and Micron claims it is faster than its rival due in part to a piece of technology called a controller that take instructions from the server\u2019s computing brain about which data to read or write on the hard drive.\n\nMicron developed the controllers internally and is hoping they will set its products apart in the memory market, where supply and demand dynamics can produce dramatic shifts in prices.\n\nMehrotra\u2019s strategy since taking over as chief executive in 2017 has been to increase the number of storage products that include technologies beyond just commodity memory chips. About half of the company\u2019s storage revenue now comes from such products, versus 20% when he arrived, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is hugely attractive,\u201d Mehrotra said of differentiating features. \u201cWe are making strong progress there.\u201d", "description": "Idaho-based memory chipmaker Micron Technology on Thursday challenged rival Intel Corp with a new line of hard drives aimed at data centers, just as the two companies are on the cusp of formally ending a joint venture of more than a decade that developed the technology.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444642796&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1RY", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
