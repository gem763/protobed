The danger presented by Dalvin Cook in the backfield and the success of Cousins at selling fakes created a wealth of play-action completions.\n\n\u201cThey run the ball, play action, and throw the ball deep,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat\u2019s just what they always do.\u201d\n\nCousins went 22 for 29 with one sack and one interception that was, oddly enough, Diggs\u2019 fault when a sideline throw hit him in the hands, bounced off his helmet and into the air behind him for former Vikings safety Andrew Sendejo to pick off late in the second quarter.\n\nThe sign that this was not the Eagles\u2018 day came right after that, when a fake field goal from the 21 failed with 20 seconds left. The snap to Jake Elliott left the kicker with only one receiver, well-covered tight end Dallas Goedert, and the desperation throw was tipped by Anthony Harris and intercepted by Everson Griffen.\n\n\u201cWe had the look we wanted, tried to take advantage of it, get an opportunity to maybe shoot it in the end zone after that,\u201d Eagles coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cThey made a great play.\u201d\n\nSTRUGGLING SECONDARY\n\nThe Eagles have been badly missing starting cornerbacks Ronald Darby and Avonte Maddox, and Cousins took full advantage. Adam Thielen made a slick double move to beat Sidney Jones for a textbook fade throw by Cousins for a 7-yard touchdown to cap the opening drive. Diggs blew by Rasul Douglas on a post route in the second quarter to put the Vikings up 17-3.\n\nDiggs beat Douglas again on the first snap of their next possession for the second of his career-best three scores, after Douglas began the play like he was settling into zone coverage and Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins missed his assignment over the top. Even with a 32-yard touchdown pass by Wentz to running back Miles Sanders before the break, the Vikings pushed their first-half scoring advantage in three home games this year to 66-17.\n\nDiggs famously made the \u201cMinneapolis Miracle\u201d catch to win a playoff game two years ago for the Vikings, then followed that big moment with his first 1,000-yard season in 2018, but after being targeted an average of 10 times per game last year, he had a quiet start to 2019.\n\nFollowing an ugly performance two weeks ago in defeat at Chicago that had the passing game out of sorts, Diggs skipped some team activities, drew more than $200,000 in fines and acknowledged unspecified dissatisfaction with the direction of the offense while speaking cryptically about his desire to be with the Vikings.\n\nSince then, the Vikings have won twice by a combined score of 66-30.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys that can light this thing up,\u201d Cook said, adding: \u201cWe give him opportunities to do what he do, he\u2019s going to be Kirk.\u201d\n\nDEFENSIVE FINISH\n\nWentz finished 26 for 40 for 306 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. After the last score by Diggs, the Eagles wilted under the weight of the Vikings pass rush and the crowd noise at U.S. Bank Stadium, where they left as first-time Super Bowl champions following their last visit two seasons ago.\n\nEric Kendricks and Mackensie Alexander shared a third-down sack after an all-out blitz called by Vikings coach Mike Zimmer forced a punt. Anthony Barr recovered a fumble by Zach Ertz to end the next drive at midfield. Alexander picked off Wentz on the following possession.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there was a lot of doubt in the stadium, because they\u2019re a very explosive team,\u201d Zimmer said.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nEagles: LT Jason Peters hurt his knee in the second quarter, returned briefly after an initial absence and then was pulled for good. Andre Dillard took over. \u2026 LB Nigel Bradham (ankle) was also injured in the second quarter and did not return.\n\nVikings: LT Riley Reiff (ankle) left in the first quarter, returned briefly, then was sidelined in the second half and replaced by Rashod Hill.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nEagles: Play at Dallas next Sunday.\n\nVikings: Play at Detroit next Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two weeks ago, Stefon Diggs was a dissatisfied star with a decreasing role for a Minnesota team in a mini-crisis on the passing attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dave Campbell"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/13/eagles_vikings_football_79268_c0-201-4828-3017_s1200x700.jpg?71700691fc464b460beae306d95fa59bb12ee3af", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
