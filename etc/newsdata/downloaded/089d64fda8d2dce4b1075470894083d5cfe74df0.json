The news isn't impacting other sectors, like precious metals or financials, much and bonds aren't doing much after an early bounce.\n\nThe market doesn't seem concerned that the oil disruption is going to cause any major economic disruption. Most stocks are just treading water, while they wait for another catalyst.\n\nWithin one week this market has had three major news events -- aggressive sector rotation, a bond bubble and pop, a large spike in oil -- but none of the events have disrupted the stock market indexes much. During this dramatic week, there has been a small positive move in the indexes.\n\nSome market commentators attribute this action to a high level of pessimism. Many market players are anticipating market problems and that leaves less selling pressure when a negative event does occur. When the market doesn't fall apart on the oil news, there is a greater inclination to look for some long exposure to keep busy.\n\nThe Fed interest rate decision is on Wednesday afternoon, and we have to wonder if that event will produce more of an emotional reaction than all these other big events. What is it going to take to shake this market up?\n\nIt may take more movement to the upside before conditions improve for a stronger downside move.\n\nWith the Fed news pending, most trades require a shorter time frame, but this action is so dull there simply isn't much showing up.\n\nIt is the nature of the market beast to go through these cycles, but this is a particularly odd environment right now. Major news events are producing little reaction, but the instability under the surface continues to build.", "description": "Despite big news headlines recently and the looming Fed rate decision, market players appear to show little emotion.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "What Would It Take To Shake Up Market", "Despite Big News Headlines Recently", "The Looming Fed Rate Decision", "Market Players Appear To Show Little Emotion.", "Jim Cramer", "Bruce Kamich", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/6bcbb123-6214-11e9-a65a-9fef72a2fbb9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
