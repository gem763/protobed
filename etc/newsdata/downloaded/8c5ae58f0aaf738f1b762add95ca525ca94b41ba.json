REUTERS/Stringer/Files\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) CEO Tim Cook met the chief of China\u2019s market regulator in Beijing on Thursday, the Chinese agency said, a week after the U.S. firm was thrust into the midst of political tensions between the mainland and protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nApple last week removed from its app store an app that helped Hong Kong protesters track police movements after a Chinese state newspaper sharply criticised it for allowing the software. The company said the app, HKmap.live, was used to target the police.\n\nCook had defended the removal in the face of criticism for appeasing mainland China, telling Apple workers that \u201cthis decision best protects our users\u201d.\n\nChina\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said in a statement on its website that its chief, Xiao Yaqing, and Cook discussed topics including Apple expanding investment in China, consumer rights protection and fulfilling corporate social responsibility. It did not give more details.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChina is a key market for Apple. Apple\u2019s smartphone market share fell to 5.8% in the June quarter from 6.4% in the same period a year ago, according to research firm Canalys, as China\u2019s homegrown Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] became the dominant smartphone seller.\n\nThe meeting also comes days before China holds the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in China\u2019s eastern Zhejiang province. The event in the past has attracted overseas company executives, foreign diplomats and Chinese government officials.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Cook will be a participant at the conference this year. He last attended the event in 2017.", "description": "Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook met the chief of China's market regulator in Beijing on Thursday, the Chinese agency said, a week after the U.S. firm was thrust into the midst of political tensions between the mainland and protesters in Hong Kong.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442165819&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H0AS", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
