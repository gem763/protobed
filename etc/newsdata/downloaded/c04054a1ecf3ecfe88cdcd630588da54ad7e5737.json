The botnet \u2014 which currently operates over 450,000 infected hosts \u2014 has been a distributor for all kinds of malware, including GandCrab, Pushdo, Pony, and even employing the hosts to mine cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe latest development comes as researchers from cybersecurity firm Reason discovered the sextortion malware \u2014 dubbed \u201cSave Yourself\u201d \u2014 infecting the hosts to also leverage the systems to secretly mine privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero.\n\nThe modus operandi in itself is fairly simple: The botnet downloads a database of email addresses from a command-and-control server, and a message is composed to a victim at random using standard email protocols, urging the individual to pay up or risk having their sexual content exposed on the internet.\n\nAside from issuing the threat, the email contains the recipient\u2019s password to make the spam email more persuasive.\n\nThe spambot can produce a large amount of spam emails, as much as 30,000 per hour, with each individual spam campaign covering up to 27 million potential victims.\n\n\u201cThe recipients of sextortion emails are from all around the world, because Phorpiex uses databases of leaked credentials similar to databases of Have I been Pwned?,\u201d Check Point researcher Alexey Bukhteyev told TNW.\n\nAlthough the operators behind the campaign are as yet unknown, Bukhteyev said almost 25 percent of the infected hosts are located in India.\n\nThe fact that plain text spam emails continue to bypass security barriers is a cause for concern.\n\n\u201cLeaked credential lists, containing passwords that are often not compatible with their linked email addresses, are a common inexpensive commodity,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cPhorpiex, a veteran botnet, has found a way to use them to generate a low maintenance, easy income on a long term basis.\u201d\n\nRead next: Cryptojacking worm uses Docker to infect over 2,000 systems to secretly mine Monero", "description": "Check Point researchers uncover a large-scale sextortion campaign by acting as a spambot to target 27 million innocent recipients.", "authors": ["Ravie Lakshmanan"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F05%2FBitcoin-Pile.jpg&signature=95feb596dc1d1f8cdf94264670f4267a", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
