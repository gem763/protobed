Biden Jr.\n\nSenator Cory Booker of New Jersey\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary\n\nSenator Kamala Harris of California\n\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota\n\nFormer Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts\n\nAndrew Yang, a former tech executive\n\nTwo other candidates have met the 130,000-donor threshold but have not met the polling threshold:\n\nRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii\n\nMarianne Williamson, a self-help author\n\nMs. Gabbard has two qualifying polls and needs two more; Ms. Williamson has only one qualifying poll and needs three more.\n\nThe remaining seven candidates have met neither threshold:\n\nSenator Michael Bennet of Colorado\n\nGov. Steve Bullock of Montana\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio of New York\n\nFormer Representative John Delaney of Maryland\n\nMayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla.\n\nRepresentative Tim Ryan of Ohio\n\nFormer Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania\n\nNone of these candidates have reached 2 percent in any qualifying polls, and the race would need to fundamentally change for any of them to make the debate stage.\n\nThis will be the first presidential campaign debate that The Times has planned and hosted in more than a decade. Mr. Lacey, The Times\u2019s National editor since 2016, oversees on-the-ground coverage of the country by several dozen reporters, focusing on major issues and concerns facing Americans. He also oversees The Times\u2019s Race/Related newsletter. Mr. Lacey is a former Washington correspondent for The Times, covering the White House and the State Department, and was also a foreign correspondent in Nairobi and Mexico City and a domestic correspondent in Phoenix.\n\nThe huge Democratic field has tested many voters\u2019 patience and prevented some of the highest-polling candidates \u2014 most notably Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, who were assigned to different debate nights in both June and July \u2014 from facing one another directly until this week. A return to a two-night format would mean that top contenders could be split again.", "description": "The Democratic National Committee has announced that the next debate will be held on Oct. 15, with a possible second night on Oct. 16.", "authors": ["Maggie Astor"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/us/politics/13octdebate/13octdebate-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
