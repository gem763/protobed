I hadn\u2019t had a serious relationship in years, it was time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the man of my dreams,\u201d I confided in my friends. \u201cHe\u2019s got to be tall, blond, handsome, strong and ambitious...\u201d\n\nWas there something in the stars that night? There was \u00addefinitely some kind of magic, because the air seemed to glitter as I was introduced to Henrik.\n\nWe liked each other instantly, and met again at midnight, after my show.\n\nRelationships on board ship were frowned upon so we had to sneak in and out of each other\u2019s cabins and steal kisses in dark corners.\n\nIt added to the excitement of falling for someone after so long.\n\nIt was wonderful! I had butterflies in my stomach day and night.\n\nHe seemed to possess every single one of the qualities on my wish list.\n\nWe courted the old-fashioned way, which was lovely \u2013 but Henrik played quite hard to get.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nThe Century returned to Fort \u00adLauderdale, Florida, where he lived, every week and sometimes he was waiting for me, sometimes not.\n\nI\u2019d be on deck straining for a glimpse of my handsome engineer, my heart going like the clappers.\n\nAs I fell headlong in love, I tried to ignore the possibility that Henrik wasn\u2019t so sure of his feelings for me.\n\nWhen he took me on a trip to Las Vegas, I popped my birth certificate in my handbag and kept it close for the entire three days, in case he whisked me off to the chapel to get married \u2013 he didn\u2019t, though.\n\nI have two abiding memories of that trip. The first is of throwing a coin into the fountain outside Caesar\u2019s Palace and making a wish that Henrik and I would stay together.\n\nThe second is of Henrik asking me how much I weighed and, when I told him, of him saying, \u2018Jane, you\u2019d be perfect if you lost half a stone.\u2019\n\nI was extremely hurt.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nStill, when we got back, I went to the gym every day and soon shed the extra pounds. Six months later I got the call that changed my life. They were making a BBC documentary about life on board another ship, the Galaxy, and asked if I would appear.\n\nIt was a year before The Cruise aired and boom, that was it! Things went berserk.\n\nViewers liked me: a hardworking northern club singer with three chins, wearing her heart on her sleeve.\n\nViewing figures hit 13 million.\n\nBefore I\u2019d left, Henrik had asked me to marry him. My dream wedding was on May 26, 1998 in the Virgin Islands.\n\nBut it became just another working day, with magazines joining the film crew.\n\nI signed a record contract, which was amazing, but people started trying to erase working-class me.\n\nI was told: \u201cStop talking on stage. Divas don\u2019t tell jokes. You\u2019re not a club singer any more.\"\n\nSoon, Henrik took over as my manager. \u201cThank God for that,\u201d I thought.\n\n(Image: REX)\n\nMy debut album went straight to No1, 13.5 million people watched my wedding, my shows were sold out and I was touring nationwide.\n\nI never thought of myself as a star, and still don\u2019t.\n\nI just wanted to please Henrik.\n\nHe was so bright, but I was beginning to worry he might be out of his depth. I should have looked closer at the contracts I signed and the financial implications, but I was gullible and clueless.\n\nYour manager is your boss and tells you what to do, what to wear and who to be, so our relationship changed. I loved him with all my heart, but felt he\u2019d stopped looking at me as a wife. I became a product.\n\nI couldn\u2019t flourish in a relationship like this. Arguments were not only between manager and artist, but also husband and wife.\n\nThe lines were too blurred. I was a slightly overweight Northern woman in her 30s but the stylists wanted me to be classier. \u201cCut your hair, lose weight, stop talking, put your arms away...\u201d\n\nI lost confidence and became introverted. Henrik and I once talked about having children but there wasn\u2019t room for babies in his plans for me.\n\n(Image: Jane McDonald)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nI began to feel lonely in my marriage.\n\nSo I started to rebel, ever so slightly.\n\nOne evening I went with my friend Sue to An Audience With...recording. I ended up having quite a few drinks, chatting to Paul O\u2019Grady and Graham Norton. We had the best night. When Sue said \u201cHenrik is waiting outside\u201d I said, \u201cSod it, let\u2019s have another drink!\u201d\n\nSoon, the record company dropped me. I think it was almost worse for Henrik. I\u2019m sure he must have been thinking: \u201cShe\u2019s on her way out.\u201d Our marriage was already on the rocks when I went to stay with friends.\n\nThey assumed we\u2019d be looking for investment opportunities. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got that type of money,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell, you should have that type of money,\u201d they said softly.\n\nI went into the office and scoured the accounts: there was no money anywhere. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d never had a minute\u2019s peace. I\u2019d had albums out, books out, tours sold out, a top TV show... I should have been a multi-millionaire, but I didn\u2019t have any money in the bank.\n\nI had left everything on the business side to Henrik, but now I took over. Eventually, I came to the devastating conclusion that I really did have nothing left. I told Henrik \u201cI\u2019m firing you as my manager.\u201d My work had dried up and it felt as if the whole industry had turned their backs on us.\n\nHenrik had loved me once but I could see in his eyes that he didn\u2019t any more. He wanted to go back to America and live his life and I loved him enough to let him. In summer 2002 he left, briefcase in hand.\n\n*Extracted from Riding The Waves By Jane McDonald published by Virgin Books, part of Penguin Random House.
