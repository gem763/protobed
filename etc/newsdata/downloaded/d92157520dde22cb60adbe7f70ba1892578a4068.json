We look forward to discussing it with them in the days and weeks to come.'\n\nWhoever wins the food fight, investors in Just Eat will be lining their pockets, not their stomachs.\n\nHSBC and StanChart\n\nHSBC and Standard Chartered both update investors on trading this week, shedding light on the impact of the unrest in Hong Kong on their businesses for the first time.\n\nThe Asia-focused banks\u2019 third-quarter results tomorrow and Wednesday respectively will be closely watched by Steve Eisman of New York investment firm Neuberger Berman. Eisman, \u2013 made famous by the Hollywood movie The Big Short \u2013 has picked the Hong Kong protests as a major risk to the global economy and is betting against shares in HSBC and Standard Chartered in an effort to profit from it.\n\nAny negative noises from HSBC tomorrow will likely cause its rival\u2019s shares to tumble.\n\nLyft\n\nIts shares may have reversed 40 per cent since it floated in New York in March, but cab-hailing app Lyft could get the jumpstart it needs on Wednesday.\n\nThat\u2019s according to number crunchers at HSBC, who reckon the company will post better than expected turnover for the third quarter, thanks to higher pricing for its journeys and more subscribers.\n\nCab-hailing app Lyft could get the jumpstart it needs on Wednesday, some analysts say\n\nInvestors were impressed by stronger turnover in the second quarter, but questions still remain over how it will turn huge losses into profit.\n\nLyft\u2019s founders say the company should become profitable by the end of 2021. Could now be the time to jump on board?\n\nBurford\n\nThe fire sale of stocks held by disgraced fund manager Neil Woodford has seen BlackRock begin offloading shares in his Equity Income Fund before it is wound up.\n\nAs well as dumping \u00a350million of shares in Provident Financial, it has shipped \u00a337million of shares in Burford Capital, on behalf of administrators Link Fund Solutions.\n\nAIM-listed Burford was targeted some time ago by short-seller Muddy Waters whose founder Carson Block said in August short-sellers were going after shares held by Woodford. That tactic must now be reaping rewards, as shares are sold off at a discount.", "description": "The battle for takeaway group Just Eat is heating up nicely.
