For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Houston Astros, embarrassed and scorned this World Series, and not just by the behavior of their front office, went out Friday to remind everyone that this is still an elite baseball team.\n\nThey played the kind of game that helped them win 107 in the regular season , becoming the first team to beat the Washington Nationals in nearly three weeks, winning 4-1 to breathe new life into the World Series.\n\nThe Astros still trail 2 games to 1 in the Series, but their victory assured that co-ace Gerrit Cole will be pitching at least one more time.\n\nAnd the Nats finally looked human. They lost their first game since Oct. 6, ending an eight-game winning streak, tied for the longest in postseason history.\n\nThe Nats, 18-3 since Sept. 23, had been on such a roll that it jarred their senses just trailing in the game. When the Astros jumped out to a 1-0 lead on Josh Reddick\u2019s run-scoring single in the second inning \u2013 which held the rest of the game \u2013 it marked the first time since Oct. 9 they trailed longer than three innings in a game.\n\nAstros' Robinson Chirinos celebrates after his home run in the sixth inning. (Photo: Jeff Roberson, AP)\n\nThe Nats, of course, still are sitting pretty, but the Astros suddenly have life, after shrugging off any notion the past two days this was going to be a short series.\n\n\u201cThere's no gloom and doom with us,\u2019\u2019 Astros outfielder George Springer said before the game. \u201cTo be around our club is to know that our club has a lot of confidence and we have a lot of resilience.\"\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know any better Friday, you\u2019d have sworn the team teams switched uniforms, or at least identities, with the Astros getting all of the key hits and making the big pitches while the Nats were the ones failing in the clutch and making blunders in the field.\n\nThe Astros entered the game hitting just .175 with runners in scoring position, but went 4-for-10, despite MVP candidate Alex Bregman\u2019s pronounced struggles (4-31 since the AL Division Series). The Nats, who hit .355 during their eight-game winning streak, were hitless in 10 at-bats in Game 3.\n\nThe Astros relievers were the unsung heroes, pitching 4 \u2153 innings, with Roberto Osuna getting the save.\n\nOsuna was heavily booed when he entered the game, with everyone being reminded last week about his domestic violence charge a year ago when Astros assistant GM Brandon Taubman taunted female reporters after their pennant-clinching game. The incident created a firestorm, and Taubman was fired on Thursday.\n\nGAME 5: Trump plans late arrival for World Series game\n\nBABY SHARK: Nats craze comes to the World Series\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to spend the whole World Series without hitting with runners (in scoring position),\u2019\u2019 Astros second baseman Jose Altuve said before the game.\n\nThey're still not in the best of shape \u2013 but they\u2019re at least alive. If they go down, the Nats will have to beat their co-ace for a second time. Cole will pitch in Game 5 on Sunday, and they\u2019ll open with rookie Jose Urquidy in a bullpen game Saturday in Game 4.\n\nBut, in the words of Bregman, they needed \u201cto stop the bleeding,\u2019\u2019 and they did just that with a tourniquet trying to save their season.\n\n\u201cI think it takes one day to stop the bleeding,\u2019\u2019 Bregman said. \u201cYou play good one game, the bleeding stops. Panic stops. You start playing the way you want to play.\u201d\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "The Astros are back in the World Series after winning Game 3 over the Nationals.
