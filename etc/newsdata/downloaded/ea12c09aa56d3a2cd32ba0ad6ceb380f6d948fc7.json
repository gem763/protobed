But nearly two decades after clearing 50 percent of the trees on his ranch, the stocky rancher admits he made mistakes.\n\n\u201cWhen I arrived here, I committed errors against the environment,\u201d Dos Santos, 63, tells AFP, sitting on the veranda of his wooden house surrounded by a lush lawn and a garden in bloom.\n\n\u201cI cleared hillsides that today I can\u2019t work and I had to leave to reforest.\u201d\n\nDos Santos grew up in Brazil\u2019s grain-growing southern state of Parana and moved north after the construction of the BR230 and BR163 highways, which opened up the remote Amazon region to cattle ranches and soy farms, fueling deforestation.\n\nHe and his 54-year-old wife Maria, also a southerner, live on a 700-hectare (1,730-acre) ranch called \u201cSao Marcos.\u201d\n\nTheir block has been transformed since they bought it \u2014 thick rainforest has been turned into pasture where they have 150 cattle for breeding. Half of their land is leased to local grain producers.\n\nLaws at the time permitted landowners to clear 50 percent of their land, which Dos Santos says in hindsight was too much. Now they are restricted to 20 percent.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a greater awareness among people about preserving the Amazon, not destroying it,\u201d he says in a baritone voice, as he and Maria sip from a tall gourd of herbal tea known as mate \u2014 a traditional drink in southern Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina.\n\n\u201cWe have to produce in a more balanced way without affecting the environment, without repeating the mistakes of the past.\u201d\n\nLife on the land is not easy, with unseasonal weather and fluctuating commodity prices among the many challenges.\n\nBut upgrades to the BR163 and BR230 highways have been positive in an area where heavy rains can cut people off from towns and animal markets during the wet season from November to June.\n\nWith their three children already grown up, the gregarious Dos Santos teaches his grandson Pedro Henrik how to look after the cattle. He hopes the 13-year-old will take over the ranch one day.\n\n\u201cWe learned to like cattle,\u201d says Dos Santos, wearing a broad-brimmed hat, after herding a group of Brahman cattle into a wooden corral.\n\n\u201cYou have to like what you do. My passion is seeing the animals healthy,\u201d adds the rancher, who is also the local agriculture secretary.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine, at 63 years of age, doing anything else.\u201d\n\nThe couple are proud of their efforts to preserve the rainforest still left on their ranch.\n\nTrees behind their house attract native birds and help lower the indoor temperature during the hottest months.\n\nIt is also a source of income. Maria, industrious and unconcerned about snakes or scorpions as she walks around in flip flops, sells organic fertilizer, which she collects from the forest floor.\n\nShe also harvests bananas from a small plantation, which she cuts down with a sharp blade as hens and chickens scratch and peck in the dirt.\n\nShe always leaves behind a few bunches for the birds to feed on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less income for us \u2026 but if you don\u2019t feed them, they won\u2019t come,\u201d she explains.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem in our municipality are people who come from outside \u2014 they just want to produce, produce, produce.\n\n\u201cBut they are destroying everything.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The indigenous teacher \u2013\n\nIndigenous school teacher Claudeth Gabriel Sau Munduruku worries about the young children sitting in her classroom.\n\nWill the Amazon rainforest still exist when they grow up?\n\n\u201cWe only see destruction,\u201d the 44-year-old says as she takes a break from teaching young members of the Munduruku tribal community in Itaituba.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if this generation of children\u2026 will still have the forest. In 10 years from now, what will happen?\u201d\n\nHalf a dozen students begin arriving in the classroom at 7:30 am.\n\nThey slip off their flip flops and take their seats at blue plastic desks, as pet dogs flop on the ground outside, waiting for the school day to finish.\n\nAbove the whirring sound of ceiling fans, Sau \u2014 wearing denim shorts and a red T-shirt \u2014 begins teaching mathematics. On other days, she focuses on geography, science or Portuguese.\n\nBut the afternoons are always dedicated to the basics of the Munduruku language.\n\nProgress in the mother tongue is slow \u2014 if there is any at all.\n\nSau says most of the children get no help from their parents, whose can barely speak Munduruku \u2014 their first language is Portuguese.\n\nOnce the children leave the indigenous school and enter the mainstream education system in Itaituba, Sau\u2019s chance to teach them Munduruku is gone.\n\n\u201cThey are bullied and I think because of that, they feel embarrassed\u201d to be indigenous and speak their language in front of others, she says.\n\nBut she persists.\n\nSau, who has been a teacher for 17 years, says the children need to learn Munduruku to strengthen their sense of identity.\n\n\u201cI started teaching by necessity, but afterwards, I embraced the education cause,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe parents need to be helping us. To learn Munduruku, the children need to practice at home.\u201d\n\nPreserving the Munduruku language is only one of the challenges facing Sau and other tribal leaders as they try to stem negative influences from town.\n\nDrugs, alcohol and prostitution have seeped into the indigenous community, located at the end of a residential street.\n\nAround 50 families live in simple wood or brick houses on 30 hectares bordering the Tapajos River.\n\nAs midday approaches, the students stop for a lunch of chicken, salad and a manioc flour mixture prepared by Sau and her assistant.\n\nFor some of the children, it is their first meal of the day.\n\n\u201cSometimes you see a child here and they say they haven\u2019t had breakfast because there wasn\u2019t any,\u201d says Sau, who is not much taller than some of her students.\n\nThe school is lacking in basic resources. There is no photocopier so the teacher writes out lessons by hand.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get support,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cChildren need to play, they must have games (to learn), but here we don\u2019t have any. We need paint, we don\u2019t have colored pencils.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked the parents, but they haven\u2019t provided any.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The (legal) logger \u2013\n\nRubens Zilio is proud to be a \u201c100 percent legal\u201d logger in the Amazon. But it irks him that some of the loudest critics of Brazil\u2019s environmental policies are reluctant to pay extra for his wood.\n\n\u201cNot all clients agree to pay more to certified producers,\u201d says the 56-year-old Zilio as he takes AFP on a tour of his sawmill in Moraes Almeida.\n\nHundreds of huge logs of jatoba, itauba, marupa, fava and cedar trees are piled several meters high in a vast outdoor yard.\n\nInside the mill, dozens of men and women wearing protective gloves, glasses and headphones operate noisy cutting machines that slice through the timber like butter, turning it into smaller pieces for pool decking or house construction in the United States, Europe and Asia.\n\n\u201cThey talk a lot about wanting to preserve the Amazon, but when it comes to buying product from the Amazon, they want the cheapest,\u201d Zilio says bitterly.\n\n\u201cFrance is the main one.\u201d\n\nRubens\u2019s company Serra Mansa was started by his father-in-law in the central-west state of Mato Grosso. The family moved further up the BR163 highway to Moraes Almeida more than 20 years ago.\n\nFor many years, Zilio says he worked on the \u201cmargins of illegality,\u201d striking agreements to extract wood from small landowners.\n\nIt got \u201cmore complicated\u201d after US missionary and rainforest defender Dorothy Stang was murdered in 2005, sparking a crackdown on illegal activities in the rainforest.\n\nZilio, his arms tanned from working outdoors, turned to wildcat mining to support his wife and three children.\n\nBut in 2016, the federal government awarded Serra Mansa and four other sawmill operators a 40-year concession to log in more than 200,000 hectares of rainforest.\n\nThe concession is divided into sections. Before Zilio\u2019s team of chainsaw-wielding loggers gets to work, the details of each tree and its location are entered into a database.\n\nThat enables buyers to trace their purchase back to its origin.\n\nThe process is monitored by government agencies to ensure Zilio does not exceed his annual extraction limit.\n\nAfter logging a section of the concession, Zilio must leave it for 30 years so it can recover.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of heat and humidity in the Amazon. The vegetation grows a lot,\u201d he says.\n\nThe concession has been good for business because customers know the wood is legit, he says.\n\nZilio bridles at foreign criticism of Brazil\u2019s management of the Amazon, especially from the G7 countries, which he says want to take \u201cour riches.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Amazon is ours,\u201d he says emphatically, echoing President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s sentiments.\n\nIn Zilio\u2019s opinion, only 50 percent of forest should be preserved.\n\nThe rest should be opened up to logging and mining concessions or farming and cattle breeding \u2014 with clear landholding titles and heavy penalties applied to those who deforest too much.\n\nZilio admits there are \u201cbad loggers\u201d in the Amazon, but he says the vast majority want to do the right thing and log sustainably.\n\n\u201cThe logger wants the forest standing to guarantee the future of his children and grandchildren,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIn the concession, there has not been a single fire in four years\u2026 because we are the guardians of the Amazon.\u201d", "description": "Itaituba (Brazil) (AFP) \u2013 Cattle breeders, indigenous teachers and loggers are among the more than 20 million people living in the Amazon in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/cbb926_luiz-medeiros-dos-santos-is-cattle-breeder-in-brazil-amazon-diverse-region-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
