She's hoping that although she's arrived here tired from winning the Osaka and Beijing titles, she will have a better showing than in 2018.\n\n\"I think last year, the end of the year was just so hectic for me, and I didn't really remember anything,\" Osaka said. \"Honestly, by the time I got here, I was just so tired.\n\nBarty, Osaka and Bencic feature in the Red group along with two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova of Czech Republic. Andreescu is in the Purple group with reigning Wimbledon champion Simona Halep of Romania, Karolina Pliskova of Czech Republic, and defending champion Elina Svitolina of Ukraine.\n\nThis year's singles winner's is guaranteed at least $ 4.1 million, which makes it the richest tournament paycheck for men or women in the sport. If the WTA Finals champion goes through to victory with an undefeated 3-0 record in round-robin matches they would earn $4.725 million in prize money.\n\nMany are touting that one of the younger generation will hoist the trophy, but Barty doesn't believe that any of the players have an advantage over the other competitors.\n\n\"In my opinion, I don't think there ever is a favorite,\" Barty said. \"I think everyone is deserving to win that's in the draw. On any given day, anyone can be beaten. That's the beauty of sport, there are no certainties.\"\n\nAndreescu seems remarkably mature and capable of handling all the notoriety that's come along with her recent U.S. Open victory. This coming week will provide her initial test in dealing with star status at an elite event.\n\n\"I found that I deal pretty well under pressure,\" Andreenscu said. \"Don't ask me how. I think my game just elevates to another level unconsciously, which I'm really grateful for. I think that's why I play my best against the top players. That was more when I was an underdog, so let's see how it is now.\"\n\nThe WTA Finals start on Sunday in the Red group when Osaka will try to improve her career record to 2-0 over Kvitova, while Barty and Bencic have a first career meeting.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "SHENZHEN, China (AP) - Top-seeded Ashleigh Barty of Australia is ready to cap off the most successful season of her career with a first appearance in the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
