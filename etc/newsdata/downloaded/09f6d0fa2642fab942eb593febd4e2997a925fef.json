Six hours into his picketing shift, he was hollering at every passing car or truck that honked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWoohoo!\u201d he shouted at one. \u201cBadass!\u201d the driver yelled back.\n\nThree weeks into one of the longest and largest private employer strikes in 50 years \u2014 some 50,000 workers have stopped working \u2014 picket lines like this are the front lines of a dispute that has seen production halted at 55 General Motors factories and parts centers.\n\nAD\n\nWorkers, who only receive $250 a week from the union during the strike and not their regular paychecks, say they want to regain ground lost in contract negotiations during the recession, now that the company is back to near-record profitability. GM, which analysts estimate could be losing as much as $100 million a day, says it needs to keep pace with foreign automakers in the United States, which are not unionized and pay workers less.\n\nAD\n\nBut the action is unfolding amid a broader conversation about inequality and the well-being of everyday Americans. Workers say they have drawn inspiration from recent battles, such as the 2018 teachers\u2019 strike in this state, that have given organized labor a newfound sense of momentum. Worker strikes are proliferating to levels not seen for 30 years. A successful effort here could help beget others.\n\nThere are early signs that the strike may begin to drag the economy in places like Michigan. Picket lines there and in other swing states have served as a revolving door for Democratic presidential candidates to show support in front of television cameras.\n\nBut a strike is not a monolith. It is a quilt stitched together from the experiences of tens of thousands of workers, including the 88 at this distribution center in West Virginia\u2019s panhandle. And to understand it, you have to go to the picket line \u2014 for all four round-the-clock shifts of it.\n\n1:20 a.m. \u2014 Route 9 picket line\n\nTraffic on this thoroughfare, heavy during the day, had slowed to a trickle. The cicadas hummed that night \u2014 Oct. 2. \u2014 the air so warm that anything more than a T-shirt felt heavy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd the 6 p.m.-to-midnight crew had mostly taken off, leaving the graveyard rotation, all under 30. Except for Gerry Van der Wijst, 61, who had been there since 3 p.m. He was banking some hours so he could take off on a trip with his wife, missing a shift over the weekend.\n\n\u201cTold the wife three weeks ago, \u2018Aw, we\u2019re not going to be on strike that weekend; don\u2019t worry,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nVan der Wijst used to own a furniture store, but it closed in 2016 after business dried up. He never thought too kindly about unions as a private business owner. Now, he said, he finds himself supporting them.\n\n\u201cI feel like if I see people picketing in the future, I\u2019m going to stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt means more to me now.\u201d\n\nThey met at a GM plant. On their wedding day, they joined the picket line.\n\n2:30 a.m. \u2014 Route 9\n\nNow it was just the three younger employees \u2014 Corbin Clark, 28; brother Elisha, 23; and Logan Byers, 27 \u2014 standing on the road.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe picket line is staffed in four six-hour shifts to cover the clock. Striking workers don red shirts during the day, but the dress code loosens overnight. Clark was in track pants.\n\nThe three men began playing a game, guessing the color of the next car on the road. It would be a long night.\n\n\u201cWatch out for them coyotes!\u201d a driver shouted out her window as she passed, sending the men into a fit of laughter.\n\nThe three, who all came in as temporary employees before getting hired full on, said the company\u2019s increasing reliance on temporary workers \u2014 now 7 percent of its workforce \u2014 was a sticking point for them. Elisha had set an informal record at the facility after temping for more than two years before being hired, they said.\n\nAD\n\nThese contract workers make significantly lower wages than the other employees but do the same work on a similar schedule. They get three unpaid days off a year and have little job security.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis is our future,\u201d said Corbin, who worked at a grocery store making less wages before GM. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be here for a while, we gotta make sure our contracts are good.\u201d\n\nPerspective | The United Auto Workers helped bail out GM. Now they feel betrayed.\n\n3:20 a.m. \u2014 Main entrance to the GM facility\n\nGM employed more than 1,000 workers in Martinsburg from the plant\u2019s founding in the 1960s to the 1990s. But the company has shed jobs over the past 20 years \u2014 consolidating certain facilities, such as the distribution center here, with its operations in Michigan, and outsourcing other jobs to factories in places such as Mexico and China.\n\nAD\n\nStill, the 88 workers left here have set up three picket lines, two of which are staffed around the clock, to show their resolve.\n\nRandy Brown, 56; Sam Beitler, 61; Carol Barnes; and Vanessa Banks, 55, stood at the second picket location about a mile away, a gravel median near the GM plant\u2019s entrance that smells vaguely of roadkill and gets even less traffic at night. They have some 90 years of work at the company among them.\n\nAD\n\nBrown cooked sausages and peppers on a makeshift wood-burning stove he had fashioned out of a waist-high steel can.\n\nBeitler, with more than 30 years at the company, said GM has always been one of the best jobs in the area.\n\nBut the strike had been a new challenge. Just days after it began, GM announced it would cut off health benefits for those striking, creating confusion for workers. Beitler\u2019s wife is in the middle of treatment for brain cancer and was waiting for an appointment at a hospital in Baltimore. But under public pressure, GM quickly shifted course and said health coverage would continue.\n\nAD\n\nThe workers said they had seen news of officials and presidential candidates visiting picket lines in Kansas City, Detroit and Ohio but noted that none of them had come to Martinsburg, population 17,000. Would Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) pay them a visit, one wondered?\n\nAD\n\nThey bit into the sausages on the quiet road, staring into the darkness.\n\nGM drops workers\u2019 health care during strike, a sign UAW impasse could drag on\n\n11:35 a.m. \u2014 Route 9\n\nA group of four workers stood in the shade of a canopy at the Route 9 picket location. It was 92 degrees and only getting hotter.\n\nThe men are fervent union supporters. But they don\u2019t want to be confused for socialists.\n\nEarl Dick, 60, an electrician at the company, said reporters from the World Socialist website, which has been writing about the strikes, had been canvassing the picket lines to recruit and take pictures, he claimed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey were taking the strike as an opportunity to infiltrate,\u201d Dick said, noting he had his Trump hat in the car.\n\nA report on the group\u2019s website seems to indicate another purpose \u2014 covering the strike to air the workers\u2019 plight.\n\nTim Armstrong, 51, said he felt as though both Democrats and most Republicans didn\u2019t care about unions beyond the money they bring in contributions. He is 22 years in to what he hopes will be a 30-year career at GM.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe one thing I do see that somebody is trying to make a difference, is Trump trying to keep the jobs in America,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nGM strike lurches on as Trump and other political leaders watch and wait\n\n5:45 p.m. \u2014 Truck entrance to GM facility\n\nA brief afternoon rush on the road had dissipated, leaving Carl Franklin, 55; Jim Ennis, 65; Banks; and Dick in lawn chairs as the sun sank into the sky. Dick was wearing the red Trump hat he had mentioned earlier.\n\nThey began to talk about the concessions the union had made amid economic head winds in 2007 and again in 2009 while the company was going through bankruptcy. The compromises created a two-tiered wage system. New hires have to spend eight years working their way up to the top wage, which is about $30 an hour.\n\nThose were tougher times. The company has been making near-record profits in recent years; it made $8.1 billion after taxes last year. And workers, who have received profit-sharing checks of about $8,000 to $10,000 the last nine years, hope to get what they say would be a fairer piece of that pie.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is no teamwork here; it\u2019s us trying to appease them,\u201d said Franklin, a retired police officer who has been at GM for 19 years.\n\nFranklin brought up the federal bailouts given to companies, including General Motors, after the financial crisis in 2008. He still remembers when AIG executives, whose company was rescued by taxpayers, turned around and flew to luxury retreats. He cited the $22 million compensation given to GM CEO Mary Barra in 2018 \u2014 280 times what the median GM worker makes, based on some estimates.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of job do you do as the CEO, to have private vehicles, multimillion-dollar income, and then you\u2019re going to sit there and question us because we want extra something on our health care?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOr just to maintain the health care we have,\u201d Banks said.\n\n9:10 p.m. \u2014 Main entrance\n\nScott Henry, 54, Lacey Hockman, 36, and Collin Hopkins, 24, sat in the darkness, talking about subsisting without a regular paycheck from GM. But other than that, workers have to rely on money they\u2019ve been told to save up for months.\n\n\u201cWe kind of prepared,\u201d Hockman said. \u201cNot exactly prepared for it to be this long.\u201d\n\nGM, one of the country\u2019s biggest manufacturers, has a long history of portentous fights with the UAW. Large-scale strikes at GM and Detroit\u2019s other big automakers in the 1930s and \u203240s helped cement the labor movement\u2019s might in a growing economy. But it has been nearly 50 years since the last strike at the company to go this long, a 1970 shutdown that lasted 67 days.\n\n\u201cI would have bet money that we wouldn\u2019t have been out this long,\u201d said Henry, an employee of 35 years.\n\nThe economic effects of an extended strike have already begun to reverberate. GM plants in Canada and Mexico have laid off some 9,000 workers amid the U.S. shutdown. Some suppliers the company buys parts from have also begun downsizing. Striking workers say they are cutting their expenses, putting pressure on restaurants and other local businesses that rely on their spending. The longer this lasts, the more severe the impact will be.\n\nHockman said she had made her car payments in advance. But, she said, you\u2019re \u201ccertainly not going out and doing a lot of extras.\u201d\n\nMost of the workers said, though, that they were prepared for the strike to continue. They felt that the cause was worth it, and that they were slowly gaining ground. The health insurance turnaround had been a modest victory. Were others on the horizon?\n\nIt was hard to say when the occasional honk from a passing car on this lonely West Virginia road was the only immediate sign the message is resonating.", "description": "The worker strike at GM is reaching historic proportions.
