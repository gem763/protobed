Elizabeth Warren speaks during a campaign event in New York City, September 17, 2019. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren released a plan Tuesday calling for \u201creal accountability\u201d to stop large corporations from hiring former government officials for lobbying purposes.\n\nCiting \u201crecent examples of the nation\u2019s largest companies giving cushy jobs to the very people who went easy on them while serving in government,\u201d Warren\u2019s plan, titled \u201cBreaking the Political Influence of Market-Dominant Companies,\u201d advocates for ending the leveraging of government connections for business advantages.\n\nGiant market-dominant companies like Facebook, Pfizer, and Comcast strategically hire senior government officials who can leverage their contacts for corporate gain. If we want to root out Washington corruption, that must end\u2014and I've got a plan. https://t.co/MYVntHdr6u \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 29, 2019\n\n\u201c[Companies] shouldn\u2019t be able to rig the system by scooping up every available former government official in an effort to get federal regulators off their backs. That\u2019s why I have put forward proposals to get big money out of politics and to end lobbying as we know it \u2014 and it\u2019s why I\u2019m going further to slam shut the revolving door between government and giant, dominant firms,\u201d Warren\u2019s plan reads.\n\nThe release comes a day after an extensive New York Times report recounted details of Warren\u2019s past legal relationships with big business.\n\nWarren calls for a ban on \u201cgiant corporations, banks, and market-dominant companies\u201d from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave the government. Warren also proposes a fine to enforce and deter companies from ignoring the ruling, with a minimum of one percent of net profit for the first violation, two percent for the second, and at least five percent for every subsequent violation. The restrictions would be overseen by a new ethics watchdog, the Office of Public Integrity, which would also have the power to prevent certain violating companies from receiving federal contracts.\n\nWarren also targets \u201csoft corruption\u201d in the Department of Defense\u2019s dealings with corporate contractors, citing that five of the six companies that hire the most government officials are the top five recipients of government contracts over the last ten years.\n\n\u201cWhen federal contracts go to the most well-connected firms instead of the best people for the job, that\u2019s corruption. It wastes taxpayer dollars \u2014 and when it comes to the DOD, threatens to undermine our national security. But good luck competing for contracts when those who receive the lion\u2019s share of the deals also have unparalleled access to the officials who are awarding them,\u201d Warren\u2019s release reads.\n\nWarren has been a prominent proponent of antitrust regulation on the campaign trail, writing in March that \u201cit\u2019s time to break up Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\u201d Earlier this month, leaked audio revealed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg calling a Warren presidency an \u201cexistential threat.\u201d", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren\u2019s plan advocates for ending the leveraging of government connections for business advantages.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
