In so doing, Springer passed Jos\u00e9 Altuve to become the Astros\u2019 all-time postseason home run leader at 13.\n\nSpringer entered Thursday batting .270/.350/.552 with 10 doubles, 12 homers, 20 walks, 21 RBI, and 26 runs scored in 183 playoff plate appearances. He was a big reason why the Astros won the 2017 World Series over the Dodgers as he slugged five homers in that series.\n\nSpringer\u2019s only other home run this postseason came in Game 2, a game-tying solo home run off of Adam Ottavino in the fifth inning.", "description": "With a three-run home run in ALCS Game 4, George Springer passed Jos\u00e9 Altuve to become the Astros' all-time postseason home run leader.", "authors": ["Bill Baer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/iUnO9_4HUyCQEAW7KJr84Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/O_gV2qhibs60yGKULbGOTA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/bfb799b74b0ec61cf4085187027c794b", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
