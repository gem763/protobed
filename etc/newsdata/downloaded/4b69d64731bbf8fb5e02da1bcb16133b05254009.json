He couldn\u2019t say whether they were men or women, because their heads were shaved, or whether they were Jews or other prisoners. He also couldn\u2019t say what happened afterwards. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone come out.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, he said, he saw a group of 10 or 15 men being led into the gas chamber, but they then came out and were taken to the crematorium building by people in white overalls. He said he heard that the prisoners were supposed to work outside the camp and had to be checked first.\n\nDey said he and around 400 other soldiers were taken to Stutthof in June or July 1944 and he did not know at the time what kind of people were incarcerated there. He said he heard only \u201crumours\u201d that they included political prisoners and Jews.\n\nThough there is no evidence that Dey was involved in a specific killing at the German camp near Danzig \u2013 today the Polish city of Gda\u0144sk \u2013 prosecutors argue that as a guard he helped the camp function.\n\nDespite his age, Dey is being tried in a juvenile court because he was 17 when he started serving at Stutthof.\n\nHe faces six months to 10 years in prison if convicted. There are no consecutive sentences under German law.", "description": "Bruno Dey, 93, tells trial he heard screaming but did not know prisoners were being killed", "authors": ["Associated Press In Berlin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eecd721782211cdf428526f2237391c5d597969/0_146_4711_2828/master/4711.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=221cfacd2b7ef7d5ef2b59d545ebdad2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
