REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\nThe upcoming campaign may be different, according to results of a new \u201cbig data\u201d survey of consumers showing that views about the economy have split along partisan lines, associated with whether an individual approves or disapproves of President Donald Trump, watches Fox News or MSNBC, or identifies as conservative or liberal.\n\nThe online poll, by data firm Morning Consult, asks the same five core questions as the University of Michigan\u2019s well-known consumer sentiment survey, and for nearly two years has been collecting about 210,000 responses a month, compared to 500 or so each month for the Michigan survey.\n\nIt also includes questions about the respondents\u2019 political leanings, and an initial set of results released Wednesday showed a stark division that may make it hard to interpret how the economy\u2019s performance will play out in 2020 presidential voting.\n\nAmerican voters face the same set of economic facts, from low unemployment to the risks from a trade war, but the survey\u2019s index of overall sentiment - at 108 just above the 100 line that separates positive from negative impressions of the economic outlook - masked the huge divide between those who approve of Trump, whose views measured a far rosier 136, and those who disapprove of the president, with a reading of 88.\n\nThe results, weighted by factors like age, race and sex, to be nationally representative, were similarly skewed based on media consumption. Viewers of conservative-leaning Fox News registered 139 for current sentiment about the economy; viewers of MSNBC, an outlet often critical of Trump, registered 89. Readers of the New York Times sat in the middle at 107, near those who get their news from Facebook (110) and Twitter (112).\n\nThe survey will be ongoing, and Morning Consult analyst John Leer said the questions on political alignment, Trump approval and media diet, were included as part of an effort by economists and analysts to try to better define how opinions are shaped and how they influence behavior.\n\nSome election models have already given Trump the edge based on the \u201crecord low unemployment rate, subdued inflation and only moderately cooler wage growth,\u201d expected next year, Oxford Economics economists Gregory Daco and James Watson wrote in a recent note anticipating a Trump victory.\n\nWhile such factors have been good predictors of electoral results in the past, \u201cit\u2019s important to distinguish the underlying economic phenomenon from political bias,\u201d Leer said, noting what he called the \u201cpotentially recursive relationship between consumer confidence and news consumption habits.\u201d\n\nConsumer poll results: here\n\nGAME CHANGER\n\nA survey like Morning Consult\u2019s doesn\u2019t establish causality - whether people feel a certain way about the economy because of the news they consume, for example, or choose their news sources based on their political stance - but it does lay the groundwork to start teasing those relationships out.\n\nThat may be particularly important in the age of Trump, who, according to several separate studies, seems to have changed the game when it comes to partisanship influencing views about the economy.\n\nThe Michigan survey itself has on occasion included questions about political party affiliation, notably before and after the elections of Ronald Reagan in 1980, Barack Obama in 2008, and Trump in 2016.\n\nEach time there were changes in economic expectations based on party alignment, with members of the winning party showing more faith in the economy, and members of the losing party reflecting less favorable sentiment. For Reagan and Obama, however, the shifts were statistically insignificant; after Trump there was a \u201cdramatic\u201d 74.6 point swing between Democrats and Republicans, according to Michigan survey director Richard Curtin.\n\nAnd it has persisted.\n\n\u201cEver since Trump was elected...Republicans have consistently anticipated a robust growth and Democrats have consistently anticipated a recession,\u201d Curtin wrote in a research note early in October.\n\nIn the past, he noted, high and rising consumer sentiment has favored the reelection of incumbents, with troughs in the outlook favoring challengers.\n\nBut \u201cthe intense partisanship that now prevails may upend traditional relationships,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFED\u2019S DILEMMA\n\nIt\u2019s not just political analysts who need to worry about the changing dynamic between partisanship and sentiment and how that might play out in the real economy.\n\nSurveys of consumer sentiment and expectations are used to help gauge future economic conditions, and the U.S. Federal Reserve in particular relies on them to assess how consumer spending may hold up, how inflation may behave, and whether people are losing or gaining confidence in the future.\n\nIf opinions about the economy have become hardwired based on ideology, rather than economic developments, it could pose a problem for that sort of analysis.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, Leer suggested, that positive sentiment will still lead consumers to spend as if the future\u2019s bright.\n\n\u201cIf consumers feel optimistic, they\u2019ll continue to support the economy,\u201d regardless of why they feel that way, he wrote in an email.\n\nSome research has suggested otherwise.\n\nA 2017 study that included Princeton University\u2019s Atif Mian and the University of Chicago\u2019s Amir Sufi also noted an \u201cunprecedented\u201d partisan swing in economic sentiment after Trump\u2019s election, six times larger than what followed Republican George W. Bush\u2019s election in 2000, for example.\n\nYet they found no change in spending in counties that voted heavily for Trump.\n\n\u201cDespite the substantial rise in economic expectations among those most likely to support Donald Trump since November 2016, we are unable to detect higher actual spending among this group after the election,\u201d they wrote. \u201cPartisan bias is exerting a stronger in\ufb02uence on economic expectations over time, but shifts in economic expectations driven by partisan bias do not appear to a\ufb00ect household spending.\u201d", "description": "The performance of the U.S. economy has been a solid clue to the outcome of past presidential elections.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444592670&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N1QV", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
