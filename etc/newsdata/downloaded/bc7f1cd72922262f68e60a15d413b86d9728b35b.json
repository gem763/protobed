Here\u2019s how the operation to kill the jihadist chief unfolded, according to the US president.\n\nWhere did it happen?\n\nThe Iraqi terrorist leader died during a raid on his safe house in the village of Barisha in Idlib province, northwestern Syria. The house is situated in one of the last areas of the country that is not controlled by the Syrian government. Trump revealed that Russia opened up its airspace to allow US special forces to carry out the raid.\n\nWhen did it happen?\n\nThe two-hour operation took place on Saturday night. \u201cUS special operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in north-west Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style,\u201d Trump said in a televised address from the White House.\n\nAlso on rt.com Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? Here\u2019s what you need to know about the infamous ISIS leader\n\nHow did it go down?\n\nTrump said US forces were met with \u201cmassive firepower\u201d as they arrived at the building where al-Baghdadi was hiding with his family and associates. \u201cThe compound had to be cleared at this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed,\u201d he said, adding that 11 young children were moved out of the house uninjured.\n\nAfter the house was cleared, the militant fled down a tunnel with three of his children where he killed himself and the children by setting off a suicide vest before he was hunted down.\n\n\u201cHe reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and his three children. His body was mutilated by the blasts. The tunnel had caved on him,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe leader of the so-called Islamic State was then positively identified by DNA tests 15 minutes after he died. \u201cHe was a sick and depraved man and now he\u2019s gone,\u201d Trump added.\n\nHow many died?\n\nWhile exact figures have yet to be provided, Trump said \u201cmany\u201d of al-Baghdadi\u2019s people were killed in the raid. He said that US forces suffered no personnel losses, with the only injury being to a military dog. He thanked Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq for their support in completing the mission.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s announcement, videos started appearing online claiming to have been made at the site of the US operation. They showed rubble, craters from bombs in the ground and destroyed vehicles, but their authenticity couldn\u2019t be verified.\n\n\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647\u062f\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u062c\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0634\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u062f\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0643\u064a\u0629. pic.twitter.com/CP4iyQFYV0 \u2014 Mohamad Rasheed \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f (@mohmad_rasheed) 27 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433.\n\n\u0641\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0648 \u064a\u0648\u0636\u062d \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0625\u0633\u062a\u0647\u062f\u0641\u062a \u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0634\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0625\u062f\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0634\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u062d\u064a \u0648\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u0645\u0646 \u0637\u0627\u0626\u0631\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629. pic.twitter.com/6tJJ7CmyKE \u2014 Mohamad Rasheed \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0634\u064a\u062f (@mohmad_rasheed) 27 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433.\n\nFootage shows the aftermath of a US raid on the Barisha village in northwest #Syria, where #ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reportedly killed. #Baghdadi\n\n\n\nRead: https://t.co/pmo8r53050pic.twitter.com/oJr3YhMedA \u2014 Kurdistan 24 English (@K24English) 27 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2019 \u0433.\n\nIraqi television also posted footage of what it said was the actual attack on al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound.
