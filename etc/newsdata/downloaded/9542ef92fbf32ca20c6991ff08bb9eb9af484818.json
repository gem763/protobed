Schapiro let it go to voicemail.\n\nGiuliani did not respond to requests for comment from NBC on Thursday before the story was published.\n\nSerial Butt Dialer\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time it happened. In September, Giuliani left a voice message where he can be heard blasting former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s family. That message didn\u2019t come late at night but rather \u201cwhen the NBC News reporter was at a fifth-birthday party for an extended family member in Central Jersey.\u201d The three-minute voice message is almost entirely of the lawyer \u201crailing against the Bidens, recycling many of the unfounded allegations he has been making on cable news and in interviews with print reporters.\u201d\n\nGiuliani also said that \u201cthere\u2019s plenty more to come out\u201d about Biden\u2019s business dealings, specifically mentioning China, Kazakhstan, and Russia. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad situation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know how they get? Biden has been trading in on his public office since he was a senator.\u201d The president\u2019s lawyer also specifically railed against Hunter Biden. \u201cWhen he became vice president, the kid decided to go around the world and say, \u2018Hire me because I\u2019m Joe Biden\u2019s son.\u2019 And most people wouldn\u2019t hire him because he had a drug problem,\u201d he said.\n\nIt seems Giuliani really needs to learn how to lock his phone properly. After Schapiro published his story, lots of reporters came out to tell their own Giuliani butt-dial tales, Slate reported. \u201cEveryone has a good Rudy butt dial story,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve heard him on what sounded like a plane, at the airport, at what sounded like a bar.\u201d Jonathan Swan of Axios tweeted that Giuliani once \u201ctexted me a voice memo recording of himself talking to a guy.\u201d\n\nGiuliani appears to know this is a problem\u2014at least sometimes. The Daily Mail\u2019s David Martosko tweeted that he once overheard Giuliani telling a Fox News producer: \u201cAnd I butt-dialed him! Can you believe it?\u201d\n\nAnd there are even hints this may be sort of a trend for lawyers in Trump\u2019s orbit. In March, Politico\u2019s Darren Samuelsohn wrote that \u201cboth Rudy and Lanny Davis, Trump\u2019s former lawyer\u2019s lawyer, butt dialed me.\u201d\n\n-- Slate contributed to this story", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, has been caught on tape talking about an apparent business arrangement with a super-wealthy Persian Gulf...", "authors": ["New York Post"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU066_giulia_ZG_20191026110533.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
