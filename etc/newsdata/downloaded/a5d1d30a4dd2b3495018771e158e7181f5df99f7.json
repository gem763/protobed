For the year to date, investors have pulled nearly $103 billion out of domestic equity funds.\n\nAt the same time, investors continued to gravitate to the perceived safety of bonds by sending another $8.5 billion into the category. For the year to date, investors have directed about $327.5 billion into bonds.\n\nWorld stock funds lost slightly more than $2 billion in outflows, making it a 4-week losing streak for the category.
