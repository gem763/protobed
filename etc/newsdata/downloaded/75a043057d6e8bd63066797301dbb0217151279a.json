It seems incredible that two political giants should have ancestors living close in the same era.\u2019\n\nBoth properties are still there today, although they are no longer businesses, she added.\n\nThe churchyard of he Church of St Mary the Virgin, Masham, North Yorkshire, where Corbyn's ancestors are buried\n\nProfessional genealogist Michael Rochford confirmed the work of Denny who proved the families were very likely to have known each other", "description": "Even sworn foes Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are unlikely to have known that their families were once next-door neighbours in Masham, Yorkshire - albeit a long time ago.", "authors": ["Chris Brooke For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/22/17/18789450-0-image-a-160_1569168421012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
