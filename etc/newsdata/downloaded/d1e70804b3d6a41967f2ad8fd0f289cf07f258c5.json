Premier League Team of the Week (September 14-15) 1/12 Premier League Team of the Week: September 14-15 Getty Images 2/12 David de Gea, Manchester United De Gea has come under a lot of criticism in recent times, but was very impressive against Leicester making good stops to deny James Maddison and Ben Chilwell. Getty Images 3/12 Serge Aurier, Tottenham Aurier is another player who has received his fair share of criticism, but was at his best against Palace, with his low cross forcing an own goal from Patrick van Aanoholt. Tottenham Hotspur FC via Getty I 4/12 Ibrahim Amadou (top centre), Norwich Though Norwich conceded twice, Amadou was outstanding against Manchester City particularly in the second half. Naturally a defensive midfielder, Amadou was very solid alongside Ben Godfrey for the Canaries. Getty Images 5/12 Nathan Ake, Bournemouth It was not surprising to hear Ake\u2019s name linked with a big money move in the summer - the Dutchman has an appetite for defending and displayed this in buckets against Everton. Getty Images 6/12 Andrew Robertson, Liverpool Robertson has not yet reached the level he was operating at last season, but against Newcastle he was very close. His piece of play to set up Mane for Liverpool\u2019s first goal was brilliant, and was his first assist of the season. Getty Images 7/12 Etienne Capoue, Watford Although Deulofeu was very good, captain Capoue was outstanding against Arsenal. The Frenchman dominated Arsenal\u2019s midfield, nullifying the threats of Dani Ceballos and Mesut Ozil. Arsenal FC via Getty Images 8/12 Scott McTominay, Manchester United United\u2019s midfield has been far from solid this season, but against Leicester McTominay put on his best performance of the season. He was aggressive in midfield and moved the ball well, reminiscent of Ander Herrera at his best. Manchester United via Getty Images 9/12 Emiliano Buendia, Norwich The diminutive Argentinian was fantastic against City, operating across the midfield with flicks, tricks and incisive passes causing havoc. Buendia was also defensively outstanding throughout. Getty Images 10/12 Son Heung-min, Tottenham Spurs are at their best when Son plays, and this was proved against Palace. His two goals demonstrated his skill, movement and fantastic two-footed ability. Getty Images 11/12 Sadio Mane, Liverpool Mohammed Salah\u2019s place as the main man at Anfield is increasingly under threat, as Mane once again put in a brilliant performance and scored a brilliant goal in Liverpool\u2019s win over Newcastle. His brace means that he is the only player since the start of last season to score 25+ non-penalty goals. AFP/Getty Images 12/12 Tammy Abraham, Chelsea With hattrick of goals that were all different in their own right, Abraham was unstoppable against Wolves. The pace and skill displayed for his third goal was particularly impressive given his size.

The Egyptian had started all four league games this season.\n\nJames Chester, Matt Targett and Jonathan Kodjia are all out injured ahead of West Ham\u2019s visit.\n\nThe Hammers will be without Michail Antonio, who suffered a hamstring against Newport County and will miss several months.\n\nPredicted Line-ups\n\nAston Villa \u2013 Heaton; Guilbert, Engels, Mings, Taylor; Luiz, McGinn, Grealish; El Ghazi, Wesley, Jota\n\nWest Ham \u2013 Fabianski; Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Masuaku; Noble, Rice; Anderson, Lanzini, Yarmolenko; Haller\u200b\n\nOdds\n\nVilla 17/10\n\nDraw 13/5\n\nWest Ham 13/8\n\nOur Prediction\n\nBoth sides have struggled at the back this season, so expect both teams to have chances and probably score.\n\nBoth teams also like to play with attacking fullbacks which allow wide players to drift inside, so the game is likely to have a high intensity with counter attacks aplenty. West Ham more than Villa have the players to take advantage of such situations.\n\nAston Villa 1-2 West Ham", "description": "Aston Villa come into this game after promising performances but indifferent results in their first four games back in the Premier League.
