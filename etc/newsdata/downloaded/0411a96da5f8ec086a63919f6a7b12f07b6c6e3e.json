Some locations may see as much as five to eight feet of storm-surge flooding, which will come on top of already high astronomical high tides. Storm surge refers to the storm-driven rise in ocean water above normally dry land.\n\nHurricane Dorian is a particularly acute threat to the coastline because of the storm\u2019s expanding wind field, with hurricane-force winds extending 70 miles from the storm\u2019s center, and tropical storm-force winds reaching 175 miles from the eye.\n\nHere's the latest #Dorian storm surge forecast from this morning. The water could reach the following heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide.

If Charleston were to see a four-to-seven-foot surge at the time of high tide, large parts of downtown would be flooded, and the event could go down in history as the second-highest water level on record there, behind only Hurricane Hugo. That storm struck in 1989 as a Category 4.\n\nThe fact that Dorian may cause a comparable flood 30 years after that far stronger storm is an indication of how much easier it is to flood coastal areas, thanks to rising sea levels.\n\nSea-level rise provides storm surge with a higher baseline on which to ride, much like a game of basketball played on a court that\u2019s gradually rising, allowing players to score far more slam dunks than they normally would. Sunny day flooding has become an increasingly common occurrence in Charleston during astronomical high tides.\n\nThe @NWSWPC has issued a High Risk area for flash flooding over eastern South Carolina & SE North Carolina for Thursday due to #Dorian. Very heavy rainfall totals of up 15 inches are possible.

That may not seem like much, but in a low-lying, highly populated area, every inch of sea-level rise matters.\n\nThe heavy rains anticipated to fall in the coastal Carolinas will make the situation worse for shoreline communities, as a foot or more of rain falling in a short period will make drainage back to the ocean more difficult, especially at times of high tide. Charleston saw significant flooding during Hurricanes Matthew and Irma, and depending on its exact arrival and forecast track, Hurricane Dorian could exceed those levels during the high tide early Thursday at 1 a.m., before the storm makes its closest pass.\n\nMajor flooding in Charleston begins at 8 feet, and as of Wednesday morning, NOAA was forecasting a peak tide height (storm surge plus background tide) of 10.3 feet for the early Thursday morning high tide. The subsequent high tide may see more significant flooding, depending on the timing of the switch to offshore winds once the center of Dorian passes to the north of Charleston.\n\nAccording to Sarah Watson, a coastal climate and resilience specialist with the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium as well as the Carolinas Integrated Sciences and Assessments, water was already coming out of the drains on some Charleston roads as of midday Wednesday. In an interview, she noted that the combination of high astronomical tides plus heavy rains, will keep water levels elevated for an extended period.\n\n\n\nObserved and forecast water levels in Charleston, S.C. (NOAA)\n\nIf the water level reaches 10.3 feet, as is predicted, it would flood many areas with potentially at least 2 feet of water, including the lower-lying historical areas and the medical district.\n\nAssuming they flood again, many of these houses will have flooded for the 4th time in 5 years. \u201cA lot of people are expecting substantial flooding,\u201d Watson said.\n\n\n\nProjected flooding for a 10.3-foot projected storm surge in Charleston, S.C. This map does not include flooding due to heavy rainfall. (The Lowcountry Hazards Center at the College of Charleston, Dr. Norman S. Levine in collaboration with the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium)\n\n\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m looking at, you know, is people are tired\u2026 You\u2019re starting to see that in people\u2019s conversations and faces that they\u2019re weary and tired\" from repeated bouts of coastal flooding. Unable to elevate their historic structures, have resorted to trying out their own flood protection barriers.\n\nNow the big fancy tiger dam. This is a $8000 set of tubes filled with water. The owners can\u2019t really elevate the house, so they bought this just in time for last year and have set it back up again. Inside they\u2019ve still sand-bagged the areas at risk (the sub basement.) pic.twitter.com/sRZkgBvhs0 \u2014 Sarah Watson (@BySarahWatson) September 4, 2019\n\nOther locations will also see damaging coastal flooding, including the area around Savannah, Ga., and large stretches of the North Carolina coastline.\n\nIn Fort Pulaski, which is about 20 miles east of Savannah along the Savannah River, the water level is forecast to reach major flood level of 11.5 feet, which would rank as the third-highest on record, trailing the levels reached during Hurricanes Matthew (12.56 feet) and Irma (12.24 feet).\n\nIn Wilmington, N.C., major coastal flooding is expected. Hurricane Florence cut off access to that city last year from a combination of heavy rains and storm-surge flooding, perhaps making people there more aware (and wary) of the risks.\n\nFlooding will be a concern along the Outer Banks of North Carolina, too, where beach erosion can reshape the coast during storms of this magnitude.\n\nJason Samenow contributed to this report.", "description": "Hurricane Dorian's most formidable weapon as it pushes into the Carolinas will be storm-surge flooding, which could be historic in some locations.", "authors": ["Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science", "The Environment.", "Andrew Freedman Edits", "Reports On Weather", "Extreme Weather", "Climate Science For Capital Weather Gang.
