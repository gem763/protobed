Lead author Professor Francis Megraud described the trend as \"alarming\". His team looked at clarithromycin, levofloxacin and metronidazole \u2013 the major antimicrobials used to kill H. pylori.\n\nIn the first study of its kind, they analysed their effect on 1,232 patients from 18 countries across Europe. This included Ireland, which was among the locations where the therapies proved most impotent.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has described superbugs as one of the biggest threats to the human race. It has named H. pylori among the most dangerous.", "description": "Antibiotic resistance to a superbug that causes cancer has more than doubled in just 20 years, according to new research.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters", "Yuki Sugiura", "Mabel Van Oranje", "Alice Albright"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/04/12/Bacteria-5-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bql2neoDcPjX0ArggwHbAGwYOGJS8qYNz7-0VoSyoiuoY.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-04-12"}
