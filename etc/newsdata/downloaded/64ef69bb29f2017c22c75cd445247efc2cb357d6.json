(AP) - The wife of Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Kyle Peko says tests have revealed she is cancer-free 2\u00bd months after being diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nPeko says his wife Giuliana was crying tears of joy upon informing him of the good news by phone shortly before he was to have dinner with a teammate Tuesday. Peko couldn\u2019t stop smiling while sharing the news in the locker room Wednesday.\n\nCalling it a blessing, he credited her wife for being positive in battling the disease. Peko says, \u201cI\u2019m super happy,\u201d and described the diagnosis as being \u201ca weight lifted off my shoulders.\u201d\n\nPeko was not expecting the news because his wife had undergone only four of 12 scheduled chemotherapy treatments. Giuliana is still scheduled to undergo chemotherapy before having follow-up tests next month, Peko said.\n\nPeko considered staying home to be with his wife in July before she urged him to report to training camp. He was cut by the Bills before the start of the season and then signed to the team\u2019s practice squad.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The wife of Buffalo Bills defensive tackle Kyle Peko says tests have revealed she is cancer-free 2\u00bd months after being diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin's lymphoma.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
