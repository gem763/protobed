Police said an operation was under way on Thursday to remove his body from steep and rocky terrain.\n\n\u201cHe has been found dead unfortunately,\u201d Theodoros Chronopoulos, a police spokesman, said. \u201cIt appears that he slipped and fell, but we still don\u2019t know that for certain.\u201d\n\nFromer, who had been travelling solo, was reported missing by his father on Sunday after they pair lost contact.\n\nPolice found his rented car parked close to Mikro Papigo, one of a network of villages known as the Zagorochoria, at 8pm on Monday. It was late on Wednesday when the emergency rescue services, backed up by tracker dogs and volunteers with knowledge of the local terrain, located him.\n\nHe had been seen last in the mountain town of Konitsa near the Albanian border, famed for its monastery where he had rented accommodation.\n\n\u201cHis body was spotted by the pilot from afar on a cliff face close to the Astraka refuge on Mount Tymfi,\u201d said Vasillis Varthakoyiannis, a fire brigade spokesman. \u201cIt\u2019s totally inaccessible, which means that a Greek navy combat helicopter carrying one of our rescuers will have to remove him. They have tried once today without success.\u201d\n\nThe Pindus range is popular with hikers and climbers, and the Vikos gorge attracts tens of thousands of visitors a year.\n\nAuthorities in Ioannina, the capital of Epirus region, described the search as one of the biggest of its kind. \u201cIn intensity and breadth I cannot remember an operation like this,\u201d said Emelia Goulas, a local police spokeswoman.\n\nFromer\u2019s mobile was off, which made the search harder still. \u201cIf it was on we\u2019d have had satellite support to help pinpoint his location,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is the second time in as many months that a missing British holidaymaker has prompted a major search operation in Greece.\n\nNatalie Christopher, 35, an astrophysicist and extreme sports enthusiast, failed to return from a morning jog on the Aegean island of Ikaria in August. Her body was later found in a isolated ravine.", "description": "Helicopter pilot finds trekker\u2019s body in Pindus mountains after three-day search operation", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1abab59976f454c116967970fa9b82355781f5e3/0_0_5464_3279/master/5464.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=476bdd3884b48669e59bc30b15a0a64e", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
