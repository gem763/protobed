The Guardian later confirmed the news.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s shock move ends months of speculation about the plans of the Bronx politician, who is hugely popular with the progressive wing of the party.\n\nWarren under attack as Democrats spar in largest primary debate in US history Read more\n\nThe endorsement is a major coup for Sanders, whose campaign has failed to move to the top of a broad Democratic field, and a blow to his fellow progressive senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has emerged as the race\u2019s new frontrunner.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is one of the four members of \u201cthe Squad\u201d, a group of four freshman congresswomen of color whose liberal policies and pointed critiques of Donald Trump have earned them praise from many on the left and virulent attacks from many conservatives.\n\nThe other squad members are Michigan\u2019s Rashida Tlaib, Minnesota\u2019s Ilhan Omar and Massachusetts\u2019 Ayanna Pressley. In a tweet, a senior CNN political journalist reported that Tlaib and Omar would also be endorsing Sanders.", "description": "The progressive New York congresswoman will join the presidential candidate at a New York rally", "authors": ["Joan E Greve", "Lauren Gambino"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/363cfedac3a784327b7c1a9e7665a50b5c8f28c4/0_380_5489_3293/master/5489.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=df65b9dd8e5f15891c629c747d047d83", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
