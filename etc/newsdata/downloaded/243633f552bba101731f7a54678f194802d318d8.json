The official death toll stood at seven but was certain to rise.\n\nA day after the most powerful hurricane on record ever to hit the country finished mauling the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama, emergency workers had yet to reach some stricken areas.\n\n\u201cRight now there are just a lot of unknowns,\u201d Parliament member Iram Lewis said. \u201cWe need help.\u201d\n\nDorian, meanwhile, pushed its way northward off the Florida shoreline with reduced but still-dangerous 105 mph (165 kph) winds on a projected course that could sideswipe Georgia and the Carolinas. An estimated 3 million people in the four states were warned to clear out, and highways leading inland were turned into one-way evacuation routes.\n\nThe storm parked over the Bahamas and pounded it for over a day and a half with winds up to 185 mph (295 kph) and torrential rains, swamping neighborhoods in muddy brown floodwaters and destroying or severely damaging thousands of homes.\n\n\u201cWe are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country\u2019s history,\u201d said Prime Minister Hubert Minnis. He said he expects the number of dead to rise.\n\nNational Security Minister Marvin Dames said rescue teams were fanning out as the winds and rain subsided, with more than 600 police officers and marines in Grand Bahama and 100 in Abaco.\n\n\u201cThe devastation is unlike anything that we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to get on the ground, get our people in the right places. We have a lot of work in the days and weeks and months ahead.\u201d\n\nRescuers used jet skis, boats and even a bulldozer to reach children and adults trapped by the swirling waters, while the U.S. Coast Guard, Britain\u2019s Royal Navy and disaster relief organizations tried to get food and medicine to survivors and take the most desperate people to safety.\n\nFive Coast Guard helicopters ran near-hourly flights to stricken Abaco, flying people to the main hospital in the capital, Nassau.\n\nHealth Minister Duane Sands said the government was airlifting 25 doctors, nurses and other health workers to Abaco and hoped to bring in mental health workers soon.\n\n\u201cThe situation is under control in Abaco,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Grand Bahama, today will tell the magnitude of the problem.\u201d\n\nAbaco and Grand Bahama islands, with a combined population of about 70,000, are known for their marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts.\n\nRed Cross spokesman Matthew Cochrane said Tuesday that more than 13,000 houses, or about 45% of the homes on Grand Bahama and Abaco, were believed to be severely damaged or destroyed. U.N. and Red Cross officials said tens of thousands of people will need food and clean drinking water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s total devastation. It\u2019s decimated. Apocalyptic,\u201d said Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a hurricane relief group and flew over Abaco. \u201cIt\u2019s not rebuilding something that was there; we have to start again.\u201d\n\nShe said her representative on Abaco told her there were \u201ca lot more dead.\u201d\n\nAt 8 a.m. EDT Wednesday, Dorian was centered about 95 miles (144 kilometers) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida, moving northwest at 8 mph (13 kph). Hurricane-force winds extended up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) from its center.\n\nDorian was expected to pass dangerously close to Georgia and perhaps strike South Carolina or North Carolina on Thursday or Friday with the potential for over a foot of rain in some spots. Forecasters warned that Dorian is likely to cause storm surge and severe flooding even if its core does not blow ashore.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tough it out. Get out,\u201d said U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency official Carlos Castillo.\n\nWith the threat to Florida easing and the danger shifting northward, Orlando\u2019s airport moved to reopen, along with Walt Disney World and Universal. To the north, the Navy ordered ships at its huge base in Norfolk, Virginia, to head out to sea for safety, and warplanes at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia, were being moved inland to Ohio.\n\nHaving seen storms swamp his home on the Georgia coast in 2016 and 2017, Joey Spalding of Tybee Island decided to empty his house and stay at a friend\u2019s apartment nearby rather than take any chances with Dorian.\n\nHe packed a U-Haul truck with tables, chairs, a chest of drawers, tools \u2014 virtually all of his furnishings except for his mattress and a large TV \u2014 and planned to park it on higher ground. He also planned to shroud his house in plastic wrap up to shoulder height and pile sandbags in front of the doors.\n\n\u201cIn this case, I don\u2019t have to come into a house full of junk,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m learning a little as I go.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Ramon Espinosa reported this story in Freeport, AP writer Danica Coto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico, and AP writer Michael Weissenstein reported from Nassau, Bahamas.
