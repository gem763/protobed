But, while excited families queue this half-term to explore its exhibits on volcanoes, dinosaurs and creepy-crawlies, one of its scientists has revealed a fatal flaw among the 29m animal specimens it holds for research purposes.\n\nA study led by NHM researcher Dr Natalie Cooper has uncovered discrepancies in gender representation, with significantly more male specimens than female.\n\nCooper found the same male skew in four other leading natural history museums around the world and the NHM reports that her work reflects \u201ca growing awareness across all areas of science of underlying sex biases in data and their repercussions in the wider world\u201d. And repercussions there will be.\n\nAt a time of unprecedented importance for scientists to understand ecosystems and work to protect endangered animals, any research that has used these kinds of collections is likely to be inaccurate. For instance, chemicals found in specimens are analysed to learn about their migration patterns, but some species have gender-specific diets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear from a scientific perspective that we would want to study males and females,\u201d says writer and feminist campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who won the Royal Society Science Book prize this year for Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men.\n\nWhile it may not be surprising that Charles Darwin and other male, mutton-chopped 19th-century specimen collectors were a bit sexist, the study has discovered that the bias remains unchanged among more recent collections. Criado-Perez doesn\u2019t find this surprising \u201cwhen you look at everything else in the world and see this is what we do when we collect data on anything\u201d.\n\nThe study, which focused on birds and mammals, found that the worst discrepancy lay in the individual specimens on which a species description is based \u2013 known as type specimens, with 25% of female birds represented, and 39% of female mammals. It would be easy to fix this, notes Cooper, but \u201cpeople don\u2019t seem to have bothered to take that option\u201d.\n\nThe scientific world and wider society sees male as the default setting, says Criado-Perez. So it\u2019s not about evil misogynistic fossil collectors deliberately ignoring female examples. \u201cWe all have this bias of seeing male as the neutral, the default, the baseline \u2013 those are the words that get applied to men. Even in clinical data sets you\u2019ll find male represented as the baseline and female represented as an affect.\u201d\n\nThe five: medical biases against women Read more\n\nBut the result is bad science. \u201cYou would think that if you care about the procreation of certain species, you would need to know what both sexes are like,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd if you care about accurately studying and representing the world, which of course is the whole point of science.\u201d\n\nCriado-Perez hopes this is the start of a new movement. \u201cThis is a revolution that needs to happen in science. Women are dying because we don\u2019t know how female bodies respond to all sorts of medication, because the diagnostic tests were developed in male bodies.\u201d\n\nThe NHM\u2019s website advertises the fact that its collections are used by the scientific community to \u201canswer key questions about the past, present and future of \u2026 life on Earth\u201d.
