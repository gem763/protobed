It had to sell three million holidays a year just to cover interest payments.\n\nWith the business draining cash, Chief Executive Peter Fankhauser found its lenders were no longer willing to step in. Fankhauser has earned 8.3 million pounds ($10.3 million), including 4.3 million pounds in 2015.\n\nThe British government said it was unwilling to \u201cthrow good money after bad\u201d to back a bail out of the company.\n\nReports on Monday said the Turkish government and a group of Spanish hoteliers were willing to support a 200 million pound rescue plan underpinned by a British government guarantee.\n\nBusiness Secretary Andrea Leadsom, however, said the sum reported would not have kept the operator going for more than a couple of weeks.\n\nThomas Cook passengers queue in front of check-in desks on the second day of repatriations at Reus airport, next to Tarragona, Spain, September 24, 2019. REUTERS/Albert Gea\n\n\u201cThere are all sorts of rumors flying, the fact is that 200 million (pounds) was even an underestimate of what Thomas Cook would have needed just for the very short term, for the next week or two,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\n\u201cThomas Cook is sitting on trying to service 1.7 billion pounds of debt, and it would have been a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money to be throwing good money after bad.\u201d\n\nThomas Cook\u2019s demise, announced in the early hours of Monday, sparked alarm at hotels where some customers have been asked to pay their bills again by out-of-pocket resort owners.\n\n\u201cI think the questions we\u2019ve got to ask ourselves now: how can this thing be stopped from happening in the future?\u201d Johnson said.\n\n\u201cHow can we make sure that tour operators take proper precautions with their business models where you don\u2019t end up with a situation where the taxpayer, the state, is having to step in and bring people home?\u201d\n\nEmergency flights brought 14,700 people back to the United Kingdom on 64 flights on Monday, and around 135,300 more were expected to be returned over the next 13 days, Britain\u2019s aviation regulator said.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\n\u201cJust got to get through it,\u201d said Anthony Tents, a Thomas Cook customer from central England trying to return home from Mallorca in Spain. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get home but it\u2019s just some of the people have lost their jobs, it\u2019s terrible, isn\u2019t it?.\u201d\n\nSeventy-four flights were scheduled on Tuesday, to bring back 16,500 people. More than 1,000 flights are planned.\n\n\u201cA repatriation of this scale and nature is unprecedented and unfortunately there will be some inconvenience and disruption for customers. We will do everything we can to minimize this as the operation continues,\u201d Richard Moriarty, Chief Executive at Britain\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority, said.\n\n\u201cWe want people to continue to enjoy their holiday, so we will bring them back to the UK on their original departure day, or very soon thereafter.\u201d", "description": "After the collapse of Thomas Cook left tens of thousands of Britons reliant on the government to bring them home, Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned whether the travel firm's bosses should have paid themselves so much ahead of its demise.", "authors": ["Kylie Maclellan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433262225&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N0JC", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
