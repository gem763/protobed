REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Over 50 banks and other financial institutions representing nearly $3 trillion (2.41 trillion pounds) in assets announced on Monday they will assess and disclose the impact their loans and investments will have on climate change using common carbon accounting standards.\n\nThey launched the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), an industry-wide effort to standardize how companies measure the carbon footprints of their investments, at a time when activists and stakeholders are pressuring the financial sector to pull back from heavily polluting fossil fuel projects.\n\n\u201cKnowing the emissions of their loans and investments means banks can be transparent with their stakeholders,\u201d said Peter Blom, CEO of Dutch bank Triodos. \u201cThey can make informed decisions that limit the negative impact, and increase the positive impact, of their financial decisions on the climate.\u201d\n\nThe banks hope the framework will become a benchmark for the financial sector as institutions and banks try to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nIt has been adopted by several Dutch banks, including ABN AMRO(ABNd.AS), which found out by using the PCAF framework that residential mortgages were one of the areas of highest carbon impact. The bank used this information to promote mortgages with incentives for energy efficiency, Kees van Dijkhuizen, CEO of ABN AMRO, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOur experience in the Netherlands is that measuring and tracking climate impact drives concrete action and change,\u201d he said.", "description": "Over 50 banks and other financial institutions representing nearly $3 trillion (2.41 trillion pounds) in assets announced on Monday they will assess and disclose the impact their loans and investments will have on climate change using common carbon accounting standards.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432926396&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M0SD", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
