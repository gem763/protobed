To mark the release of a major retrospective, Ian Winwood remembers the pulverising power of Britain's purest rock band\n\nThe first time I interviewed Lemmy was in the bar of a London hotel in 1995. Drinking Jim Beam and Coke with a stoic determination, he was funny and kind. This came as a relief as I was breaking one of music journalism\u2019s cardinal rules \u2013 never meet your heroes.\n\nI was 10 years old when I first heard Motorhead, a three-minute earthquake from the radio that upended my life. The man responsible for this tumult seemed pleased to hear of it, and gave me an evening of his time.\n\nAt the bar he fell into a brief conversation with a well-dressed couple who asked what he did for a living. On learning that he was the bandleader with Motorhead, far too casually one of them said, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know you were still going.\u201d Lemmy appeared chastened \u2013 in truth, he looked hurt \u2013 and proceeded to give the disinterested pair a forensic account of the group\u2019s recent past as well as a detailed itinerary of their immediate future.", "description": "NME readers once voted Motorhead \"the best worst band in the world\";", "authors": ["Ian Winwood"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000151013970-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-pfgFGBz9L_4V5dRQnfCxd6yN5CV7Pul_xM_LGnPwu0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
