(Photo: Ken Osburn, The Greenville (S.C.) News) Story Highlights Johnnie Mac Walters was head of IRS in early 1970s during Watergate scandal\n\nWhite House wanted IRS to investigate its enemies\n\nWalters says IRS never audited anybody because of 'enemies list'\n\nGREENVILLE, S.C. -- At his home near Furman University, Johnnie Mac Walters remembers being pressured more than 40 years ago to do what he considered unthinkable.\n\nAmid the books about government and photos of former presidents, the aftermath of the Watergate break-in remains a vivid memory.\n\nIn the early 1970s, when embattled President Richard Nixon sought to use the Internal Revenue Service as a weapon to investigate his enemies, the administration turned to Walters, a Hartsville, S.C., native and head of the tax agency, to do the dirty work.\n\nWalters, now 93, said he refused.\n\nThe IRS controversy currently dogging President Barack Obama has raised new allegations that the agency has been engaged in political meddling and bias. Obama has denounced as \"outrageous\" the targeting of conservative political groups by the IRS.\n\nWalters walks with a cane now and is soft-spoken. But the recent IRS developments prompted him to sit down for an interview and resume his personal quest, not for vindication, but to validate his rejection of Nixon's tactics while he was commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n\"He's a white hat in the story. He's not a black hat,\" Tim Naftali, former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, said of Walters.\n\nNixon sought to use the enemies list to target his opponents and he wanted to use the IRS to achieve that goal, Naftali said.\n\n\"The story is interesting because the IRS wouldn't do it,\" he said. \"It didn't happen, not because the White House didn't want it to happen, but because people like Johnnie Walters said 'no.'\"\n\nWalters said he was stunned in 1972 when White House counsel John Dean gave him an envelope containing an \"enemies list\" of about 200 prominent Democrats.\n\nThe election was approaching and he understood that the White House wanted the Democrats \"investigated and some put in jail\" Walters would write later in his book, Our Journey.\n\n\"I said to him, 'John, do you know what you're doing?' \" Walters recalled. \"He said, 'No, what do you mean?'\"\n\nWalters, in disbelief, walked out with the enemies list. A couple of days later, he showed the list to Secretary of the Treasury George Shultz, his boss, and said that in his opinion the IRS should do \"absolutely nothing\" with it.\n\nShultz glanced at the list, threw it back across his desk and indicated that Walters should lock it up in his safe and do nothing further, Walters wrote.\n\nHe personally sealed the list, locked it in the safe and told no one at the IRS he had it.\n\n\"We did not touch a single person on that list,\" he said.\n\nSome Republicans have tried to link Obama to what the IRS has acknowledged was improper scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\n\"I'm distressed at what's happening and particularly with IRS,\" said Walters, a lifelong Republican. \"IRS must be run nonpolitical. Our tax system otherwise will fail and we can't afford that.\"\n\nNominated by Nixon, Walters was IRS commissioner from Aug. 6, 1971, to April 30, 1973.\n\nWalters said that some months after he got enemies list, Dean and John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic adviser, testified before a congressional committee that the White House had given it to him.\n\nWalters said he immediately called someone he had known for years, Larry Woodworth, executive director of the Joint Tax Committee, and gave the list to him, still sealed. Woodworth agreed to keep the list, Walters said.\n\n\"In my opinion, of all the things I did for IRS while commissioner, the most important one was to deliver that enemies list sealed to Larry Woodworth,\" Walters wrote in his book. \"Because then we could say with absolute certainty that IRS never began any audit or investigation of any name on that list because of the list.\"\n\nIt also kept him out of jail, Walters wrote.\n\n\"He was a courageous and ethical man who understood the functions of government and of his agency and the importance to the agency of what he did,\" William Sessions, former director of the FBI, said of Walters.\n\nWalters, a graduate of Furman and of the University of Michigan Law School, practiced law until age 77. He worked as a financial consultant until age 85.\n\nNaftali, former director of the Nixon library and museum, interviewed Walters in Greenville in 2008 for more than three hours about the Watergate scandal.\n\nWalters and Shultz \"were under enormous pressure to bend and they didn't,\" Naftali said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/12VlZcx", "description": "GREENVILLE, S.C. -- At his home near Furman University, Johnnie Mac Walters remembers being pressured more than 40 years ago to do what he considered unthinkable.
