With three strikes, out went the goal drought that has stalked him since his \u00a358million move to Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund. And, clutching the match ball with a beaming grin, he made his own declaration: 'This is just the start'.\n\nChristian Pulisic opened his Chelsea goal scoring account with a hat-trick at Burnley\n\nPulisic is mobbed by team-mates after netting his treble in the 4-2 Premier League win\n\nPulisic's breakthrough is the latest positive in what is beginning to look like a key chapter in Chelsea's own story. Frank Lampard has given his gifted youngsters a stage and they are performing every week.\n\nDespite nearly all pre-season predictions, the top four is now looking a strong possibility for Lampard's young squad. Who knows where they can go in the Champions League? There can be no doubting that Chelsea are cool again.\n\nAnd yet, some had wondered aloud about Lampard's tough-love approach with Pulisic, who was making his first start in the Premier League since August.\n\nIt now looks like a masterstroke, and there were no complaints from the man himself. 'He believes in me and he's told me that,' Pulisic said of his manager. 'You have to keep working hard in training and earn your spot, that's how it is at the highest level. I'm going to continue to do so. This is hopefully just the start. I didn't come here expecting everything to be easy and have an easy route and start every game.'\n\nFrank Lampard has been patient in introducing Pulisic into the Chelsea team\n\nThe spotlight on Pulisic back in the States has been intense. He is the great hope for chip-on-the-shoulder soccer-lovers across the Atlantic, seen as the man equipped to show the world that Americans can perform on the elite stage. Not that he feels any extra responsibility. 'I don't feel pressure from back home at all,' Pulisic said. 'I know who I need to worry about at home and that is my family and my closest friends and those who care about me. And I have their support and that is what matters to me.'\n\nThat said, he was honest enough to accept that he felt a burden lifted, something illustrated by his slide and scream after his first goal, a clinical bottom-corner sweep after a 30-yard burst.\n\n'Of course there is a sense of relief \u2014 you could see that in my emotions after the first goal. That relief of getting my first goal and being able to help my team at this level. It's really good for me.' It was the first hat-trick of Pulisic's career.\n\nReally good for him and for Lampard, who now has another selection problem. 'It is great for me,' Lampard said. 'I am delighted for him. To see him come in and impact the game like he did. It lifts everybody around him. Of course, he gives himself a great chance of playing in the games coming up.'\n\nDespite limited playing time, Pulisic claimed he has been encouraged by Lampard approach\n\nLampard's rapidly maturing kids are all right and have now seven wins in a row across all competitions. There is life after Eden Hazard. 'I am really pleased where we have got to,' Lampard said. 'We have to be aware we can improve. Let everyone else talk but from within we have to know it is game by game and how we can get better day by day.'\n\nBurnley, who found themselves four down thanks to Pulisic's three and a low drive by Willian, rallied late on and scored twice in the final five minutes through Jay Rodriguez and Dwight McNeil.\n\nRodriguez, whose goal was a screamer from distance, took some comfort: 'We just showed that no matter what, we go to the end and that's something to be proud of. We'll take that into the next game.'", "description": "Some had wondered aloud about Lampard's tough-love approach with Pulisic, who was making his first start in the Premier League since August before Pulsic broke his Blues goal drought.", "authors": ["Mike Keegan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/22/20258400-0-image-a-44_1572216413672.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
