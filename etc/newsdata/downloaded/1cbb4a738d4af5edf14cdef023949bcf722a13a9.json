And although they are on four each, McIlroy has endured five blank years compared to Koepka netting his quartet in the past three seasons.\u200b\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out here for, what, five years,\u201d Koepka told AFP. \u201cRory hasn\u2019t won a major since I\u2019ve been on the PGA Tour. So I just don\u2019t view it as a rivalry. I\u2019m not looking at anybody behind me.\u200b\n\n\u201cI\u2019m No 1 in the world. I\u2019ve got open road in front of me. I\u2019m not looking in the rear-view mirror, so I don\u2019t see it as a rivalry. You know if the fans do, then that\u2019s on them and it could be fun. [But] I just don\u2019t see it.\u201d \u200b\n\nKoepka could still be smarting from his fellows pros voting McIlroy as PGA Tour player of the year, a decision that McIlroy admitted he found \u201csurprising\u201d. For his part, Koepka put on an air of indifference at the time, but he was obviously unimpressed.\u200b", "description": "Brooks Koepka has dismissed the hyping of a \u201crivalry\u201d between him and Rory McIlroy, witheringly pointing out that the Irishman \u201chasn\u2019t won a major since I\u2019ve been on the PGA Tour\u201d.", "authors": ["James Corrigan", "Golf Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/golf/2019/10/16/205067307_AP-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3Z7i_2nUjuO-XXgVmfiyhAJsOLMERvTg-uo0-5hMZUQ.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
