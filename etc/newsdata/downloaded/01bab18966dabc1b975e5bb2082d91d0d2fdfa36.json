It is not even a fortnight since Boris Johnson launched a campaign to brand Jeremy Corbyn a \u201cchicken\u201d, for not being stupid enough to give him a general election on the precise day he wants.\n\nAnd yet, on Monday afternoon, he refused to go to his own press conference in Luxembourg because it would have been, in his own words \u201ctoo noisy\u201d.\n\nAt such times, it is hard not to consider the emotions of a particular member of Conservative party staff. Somewhere, in the Conservative press office, watching the scenes in Luxembourg on television, will have been the very same person who, two weeks ago, was forced to dress up as a chicken and wander round Westminster handing out Tesco Value chicken breasts in Jeremy-Corbyn-branded packaging.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

There were as many as eighty anti-Brexit protesters waiting behind the gates at his scheduled press conference with the Luxembourg PM Xavier Bettel. In such circumstances, what choice did Boris Johnson have but to not appear at all?\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

How could the Incredible Hulk himself have been expected to cope with the premeditated snark of a prime minister from a country with a population slightly larger than Reading?\n\nIn such circumstances, how can the prime minister possibly be blamed for not turning up at all?\n\nOne other reason, perhaps, is that he knows he has absolutely nothing to say. That his entire Brexit strategy is a no-longer concealed lie that is dying in plain sight.\n\nIndeed, there is, arguably, no small amount of good fortune in Boris Johnson becoming prime minister right at the moment the role became a ceremonial one.\n\nFor around 30 years, one of the now prime minister\u2019s favourite after-dinner jokes was that he has \u201conly one conviction, and that is for speeding\u201d.\n\nOther prime ministers, like, say, all the other ones there have ever been, might find themselves frustrated at not being able to do anything, but this is a burden that will fall uniquely lightly on Johnson\u2019s untroubled shoulders.\n\nHe can\u2019t seem to get an election. He can\u2019t seem to get the UK out of the European Union. His one actual policy, of 20,000 new police officers, he accidentally confessed to a Doncaster shopper amounted to no more than putting back the same number that his party has removed.\n\nAnd now, on Monday, he has been to a restaurant in Luxembourg to meet Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier to carry on what can only be described as the Potemkin Brexit negotiations.\n\nSome brief background: 26 days ago, he punched the Berlin air with glee when Angela Merkel told him he had \u201c30 days\u201d to find a workable solution to the Irish backstop problem.\n\nWith four of them to go, Juncker and Barnier have again had to make clear that they are still waiting for any such proposals to be made.\n\nSuch was their summary of a two-hour lunch, which began and ended with Boris Johnson being booed on his way in and out of a restaurant in Luxembourg, by a small but dedicated crowd of protesters who are unwilling to play the roles Johnson would like of them in this deeply depressing and utterly ridiculous pantomime.\n\nDoes Johnson care that he is widely reviled everywhere he goes? For someone who became a politician for absolutely no reason beyond the service of his own towering narcissism, one imagines the answer must be yes.\n\nBut it is not a reality that stands much prospect of changing. These are the natural consequences of his actions.\n\nThere has already been too much written about David Cameron\u2019s forthcoming book, even in the three days since it returned to the news agenda. But the executive summary is quite short. He doesn\u2019t regret calling the referendum, but he absolutely didn\u2019t realise that Johnson, Gove and the rest of the Vote Leave campaign, who are now the government, would go to the places they did.\n\nHe didn\u2019t realise Michael Gove would become a \u201cfoam-flecked Faragist\u201d, would happily talk about \u201cTurkey\u201d and the UK \u201cbeing swamped\u201d.\n\nHe didn\u2019t realise they would base their campaign on what can only be called Islamophobic lies.\n\nHe didn't realise he would face a psychopathic campaign for which the price of victory could never be too high, and which has delivered the British politics of the moment to its febrile, perhaps unsalvageable place.\n\nHe never imagined that a referendum, fought principally to liberate the Conservatives from the damage inflicted on it by Nigel Farage, would lead, three years later, to the two of them discussing some sort of electoral pact.\n\nThe people who ran that campaign are now running the country. They will do anything and say anything to get beyond the next obstacle, now matter how impossible, no matter how untrue.\n\nIt is a journey that has led to prime minister Johnson, sitting across a restaurant table with nothing to say, nothing to offer, beyond a campaign of misdirection at home, talking up negotiations that are not happening, and not offering any possibilities that can open the path to progress. Because there are none.\n\nWe are at Brexit\u2019s biggest crunch point. Like Kipling\u2019s dead statesman, Vote Leave has seen all of its lies proven untrue. It has nothing to offer now, just as it had nothing to offer then. It only has more of the same. More strategy, more tactics, more clever hacks for how it might escape from underneath the crushing weight of reality for which they bear total responsibility.\n\nIt is an almighty mess. No wonder they\u2019re booing, from Leeds to Luxembourg. And Johnson cannot do a thing about it.", "description": "It is 24 hours since Boris Johnson described himself in a newspaper interview as The Incredible Hulk.
