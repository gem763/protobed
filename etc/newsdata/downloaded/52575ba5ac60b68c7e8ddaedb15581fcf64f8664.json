So, she took to her public platform to say that she\u2019s looking for male friends \u2014 but only if they meet her criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re male, please be between 41 to 55, single (you could be widowed, divorced, legally separated, or annulled), and if you\u2019re a DOCTOR (especially a rheumatoid, immunology, allergy specialist, neurologist, anesthesiologist, pain management specialist, or cardiologist) promise I will immediately ACCEPT your friend request,\u201d she wrote in English and Filipino.\n\nRead: WATCH: Comedian shows what a \u2018Crazy Rich\u2019 Filipino auntie is like\n\nThe former presidential daughter has chronic spontaneous urticaria, an auto-immune disease, which probably explains why she wants to be \u201cfriends\u201d with a doctor. But apparently, her two sons Josh and Bimby Aquino are looking at other Facebook friend qualifications.\n\n\u201cMy 2 sons said okay w/ them if you\u2019re a pilot who has an international route- hehehe. ([That\u2019s a] preview of what\u2019s ahead of you),\u201d she wrote.\n\nAquino has a famously interesting dating history. She had her son Josh with former partner Philip Salvador, whom she separated from in 1999. She has been married once: in 2005 to professional basketball player James Yap, with whom she had her son Bimby. Alas, the marriage was annulled seven years later.\n\nRead: Kris Aquino slams Duterte\u2019s long-time assistant Bong Go for joking that ex-partner fooled her\n\nDespite her past heartaches, her fans have remained optimistic that she will eventually find her forever love. None of her followers had anything negative to say about her dating strategy, and even suggested some people they knew.\n\n\u201cMy neurosurgeon is very much single at 51, charming, smart, has a bachelor\u2019s degree in Literature (imagine!!!), and could pass as Keanu Reeve\u2019s brother.
