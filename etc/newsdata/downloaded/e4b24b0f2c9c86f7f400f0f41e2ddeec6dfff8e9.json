A White House official confirmed its authenticity to The Hill.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: I have obtained a copy of \u2066@realDonaldTrump\u2069\u2019s letter to #Erdogan. \u2066@POTUS\u2069 warns him to not \u201cbe a tough guy!

Trump has since imposed sanctions on Turkey over the military offensive.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal! You don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe president said he had already given Turkey a \u201clittle sample,\u201d referencing sanctions imposed on Ankara over the imprisonment of American pastor Andrew Brunson. Turkey eventually freed Brunson last October and the U.S. lifted the sanctions.\n\n\u201cI have worked hard to solve some of your problems. Don\u2019t let the world down. You can make a great deal,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter to Erdo\u011fan.\n\nTrump referenced conversations with Kurdish general Mazloum Kobani Abdi, who leads the Syrian Democratic Forces, saying he \u201cis willing to negotiate with you, and he is willing to make concessions that they would never have made in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cHistory will look upon you favorably if you get this done the right and humane way. It will look upon you forever as the devil if good things don\u2019t happen. Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Trump wrote, ending the letter with a promise to call Erdo\u011fan \u201clater.\u201d\n\nTrump referenced the letter at a press conference with the Italian president earlier Wednesday, while dismissing characterizations that he gave Turkey the \u201cgreen light\u201d to launch a military offensive by withdrawing U.S. troops from northern Syria. Trump also said he could release the letter, calling it \u201cvery powerful.\u201d\n\n\"I didn\u2019t give him a green light,\u201d Trump told reporters in the East Room. \u201cThey\u2019ve been wanting to do that for years and, frankly, they\u2019ve been fighting for many, many years.\u201d\n\nTrump has faced mounting criticism of his decision to pull back U.S. forces in Syria, which was abruptly announced by the White House late on Sunday, Oct. 6, after he held a call with Erdo\u011fan.\n\nCritics, including several Republicans, have accused Trump of paving the way for the Turkish military operation against Syrian Kurds \u2014 who Ankara considers a terrorist group \u2014 and abandoning Kurdish forces, a key ally in the fight against ISIS.\n\nTrump has robustly defended his move over the past week, and administration officials have worked to counter the narrative that the withdrawal served as a green light to Turkey.\n\nTrump also announced sanctions on Turkey on Monday, and Vice President Pence is leading a U.S. delegation to Ankara to meet with Erdo\u011fan about the prospect of a cease-fire.", "description": "President Trump wrote a letter to President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan last week warning him not to be a \u201ctough guy\u201d or a \u201cfool\u201d as Turkey prepared to launch a military offensive in northern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_10162019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
