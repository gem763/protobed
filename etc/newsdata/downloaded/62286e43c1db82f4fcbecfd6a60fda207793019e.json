Hoarse Speaker Bercow battles to be heard", "language": "en", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Speaker John Bercow, one of the most prominent voices in Britain\u2019s Brexit debate, struggled to make himself heard on Thursday when a sore throat cruelly reduced his customary booming cry of \u201cOrder! Order\u201d to a painful-sounding growl.\n\nBercow, who has refereed hours of rancorous Brexit debate in parliament in recent years, has earned global notoriety for his loud and verbose outbursts, ruthlessly chiding lawmakers who step out of line and making sure speeches can be heard.\n\nBut on Thursday he kicked off the day\u2019s parliamentary session in much less flamboyant style, forced to clear his throat mid-\u201cOrder, order\u201d and struggle with his words in a noticeably hoarse voice.\n\nThe contrast with his usual delivery caused sitting members of parliament to titter, before Bercow remarked in wry fashion to one inaudible heckler: \u201cIt won\u2019t last long, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nOne lawmaker even offered him a lozenge.\n\nBercow\u2019s office said: \u201cThe simple truth is, he has a sore throat.\u201d\n\nIt was the most prominent loss of a political voice in Britain since 2017 when then Prime Minister Theresa May famously croaked her way through a speech at the Conservative Party conference.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Speaker John Bercow speaks after Britain\u2019s parliament voted on whether to hold an early general election, in Parliament in London, Britain, September 10, 2019, in this still image taken from Parliament TV footage.
