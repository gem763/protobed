Mukesh Ambani, who runs the oil-gas-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries, added $4.1 billion (R60 billion) to his net worth.\n\nThe 62-year-old is now worth an estimated $52.7 billion (R781 billion), making him the 15th-richest person in the world. Ambani has now been India's richest man for 12 years in a row.\n\n\n\nThe Ambani family is known for living in a lavish, 27-storey skyscraper in Mumbai that cost an estimated $1 billion (R14 billion) to build. The weddings of two of Ambani's children, in December 2018 and March 2019, were attended by the likes of Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Hillary Clinton, actress Priyanka Chopra, and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nThe next-richest Indian, Gautam Adani, is worth an estimated $15.7 billion (R232 billion). That may be a whopping $37 billion (R548 billion) less than Ambani, but Adani rose 8 spots in the past year to become the second-richest man in India. The infrastructure and coal mining billionaire got approval in 2019 to start work on a coal mine in Australia after waiting 9 years, according to Forbes. Adani also controls India's largest port, Mundra Port.\n\nWhile most Indian billionaires - with exceptions such as Ambani and Adani - lost money in the past year, billionaires in France made more money than their counterparts anywhere else in the world, as Taylor Nicole Rogers reported for Business Insider.\n\nThe personal fortunes of French billionaires grew more than twice as fast as those of American and Chinese billionaires in the first half of 2019, Bloomberg's Alexander Sazonov reported in July, mainly thanks to China's growing desire for luxury goods.\n\nTake Bernard Arnault, France's richest person and the third-richest in the world, who runs LVMH, the world's largest maker of luxury goods. Last week, Arnault made $5.1 billion (R75 billion) in less than 48 hours - and he's now made more money in 2019 than any other person listed in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.", "description": "While most of India's richest people took hits to their net worths over the past year, Mukesh Ambani grew more than $4 billion richer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5151/a5e6fa0edf224ac3a2e44fefa3c706a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
