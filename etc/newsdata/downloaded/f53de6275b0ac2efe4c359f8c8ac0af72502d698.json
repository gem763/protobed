But autocratic governments around the world have realized that they can manipulate Interpol\u2019s system of alerts \u2014 especially its famous Red Notice \u2014 to harass journalists, political opponents, and businesspeople. This is part of the wider phenomenon of transnational repression, in which the long arm of international organizations and law is perverted for repressive purposes.\n\nThe bipartisan TRAP Act \u2014 the Transnational Repression Accountability and Prevention Act \u2014 introduced in the Senate and the House by the leaders of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, seeks to put the U.S. in the forefront of the fight against Interpol abuse. Please join us at The Heritage Foundation as a distinguished panel assesses the problem of Interpol abuse and the TRAP Act\u2019s potential to prevent it.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/themes/heritage/src/images/bell.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
