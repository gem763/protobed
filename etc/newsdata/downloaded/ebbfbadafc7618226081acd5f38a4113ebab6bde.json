He denied ever courting the theory that Ukrainians hacked the Democratic National Committee and then framed the Russian government. Pivoting, he said there was still \u201ca load of evidence that Ukrainians created false information\u201d for the Obama White House. He also alleged \u201cthe collusion that they claim happened in Russia happened in the Ukraine with Hillary Clinton.\"\n\n\u201cThe Ukrainians came to me,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cI didn't go to them.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has previously called for Ukraine to investigate to determine if Biden \u2014 while he was vice president \u2014 threatened to withhold monetary aid for Ukraine and pushed for the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to help his son, Hunter Biden, who held a board position on a Ukrainian energy company. Giuliani has been at the center of the controversy over Trump\u2019s July 25th phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine in which Trump discussed a possible investigation of the Bidens.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

But Giuliani brought allegations of corruption against the Biden to the forefront again Sunday, adding that they received at least $1 billion from China and their work there should be further looked into.\n\nAppearing on CBS later Sunday to push the claims, Giuliani also addressed Kurt Volker's Friday resignation \u2014 he was the U.S. envoy to Ukraine \u2014 and reiterated he contacted Ukraine officials at the request of the State Department: \"I have all of the text messages to prove it.\"\n\nGiuliani said Volker \"did his job honorably and decently,\" debriefing him on what to ask a top Zelensky aide and setting up meetings for him. Asked if Secretary of State Mike Pomepo knew about those meetings with Ukrainians, however, Giuliani initially said \"he did not.\" He later amended, saying that he talked to Pompeo last week and the secretary said he was \"aware of it.\"\n\nThroughout his ABC interview, Giuliani and host Goerge Stephanopoulos had fiery back-and-forths, disagreeing about media partisanship and the factual accuracy of some of Giuliani's claims.\n\nHeard from Giuliani: \u201cLet\u2019s get on to the point.\u201d \u201cLet me finish.\u201d \u201cGeorge, is it possible for you to ever treat a charge against a Democrat in the same way you treat a charge against a Republican?\u201d\n\nHeard from Stephanopoulos: \u201cDo you accept that\u2019s not true?\u201d \u201cAre you telling me if there was evidence that Barack Obama was calling up the Russians saying, 'I want you to look into Donald Trump,' that you wouldn\u2019t be blowing that up?\u201d\n\nIn a testy end to the interview, Giuliani said he might not cooperate with the House Intelligence Committee, at least until Democrats removed chairman Adam Schiff and put in someone \u201cneutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to be guided by my client. If he wants me to testify, I'll testify,\u201d he said, referring to the president. \u201cAdam, where's the evidence? Ask him to produce the evidence.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos said, \u201cHe's coming up \u2014\u201d\n\nGiuliani cut him off: \u201cAre you going to interrupt him as often as you did me?\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/5d/3b4c445642a6a948eb274f6d3409/20190929-rudy-file-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
