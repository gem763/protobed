REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s quick pivot from shrinking its balance sheet by around $50 billion per month to now expanding by $60 billion monthly, has shown both the difficulty the Fed has faced under a shifting political environment, as well as the risks of experimenting with market-sensitive systems in real time.\n\nThe process of paring the balance sheet from its crisis-era levels of more than $4 trillion in assets, effectively \u201cunwinding\u201d some of the stimulus put in place to battle the worst financial crisis in a century, was agonized over for years by policymakers who were under sometimes intense pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill who wanted a smaller central bank not so deeply engrained in private markets.\n\nThe careful shedding of $50 billion a month was lauded by those lawmakers as the Fed rolled it out in 2017, and was intended, as former Chair Janet Yellen said, to be so boring and non-disruptive it would be \u201clike watching paint dry.\u201d\n\nAnd so it was, until President Donald Trump took notice near the end of his second year in office, chucked standing Republican concerns over the size of the Fed\u2019s asset holdings, and criticized central bankers for doing what leading members of his party had demanded.\n\n\u201cStop with the 50 B\u2019s,\u201d Trump tweeted in December.\n\nFar from the traditional GOP concerns over \u201ceasy money,\u201d Trump felt the Fed\u2019s withdrawal from bond and mortgage markets was adding even more of an economic drag beyond what were then ongoing rate hikes.\n\nBy July, the $50 billion monthly rundown had ended. Two months later, the Fed confronted a new problem, one which had nothing to do with Trump and everything to do with its new system for managing interest rates.\n\nThat system depended on the Fed knowing roughly how much banks would demand in deposits at the central bank, which financial institutions may want to hold for a variety of reasons.\n\nPAINTED INTO A CORNER?\n\nBut as time passed, Fed officials realized they weren\u2019t sure quite what the demand would be and would have to feel their way.\n\nLast month, Yellen\u2019s paint-drying exercise was upended, and raised questions about how prepared the Fed was to manage a central bit of its business - ensuring adequate liquidity in financial markets.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been really surprised at the struggle the Fed has had getting overnight rates to where they want them to be,\u201d Northern Trust economist Carl Tannenbaum said. \u201cThe Fed has had a hell of time\u201d steering overnight rates to the midpoint of its target range of 1.75% to 2.00%.\n\nPart of the problem, he said, is that the Fed was so intent on shrinking the balance sheet on \u201cautopilot\u201d that it \u201cprobably pushed the balance sheet reduction further than it should have done.\u201d\n\nBut the fact that reserves were becoming scarce, Tannenbaum said, should have been obvious.\n\nTo Tannenbaum, the new operation should definitely be considered under the umbrella of monetary policy. \u201cMonetary policy is implemented with a combination of steps,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe steps taken recently by the Fed are part of monetary policy, and have to be considered that.\u201d\n\nNot so, said Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan.\n\n\u201cIt is not intended to create more accommodation or create more stimulus,\u201d told reporters after a talk at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco. \u201cThis is not intended to have any impact on monetary policy. It\u2019s not designed that way.\u201d\n\nThe two interest rate reductions passed by the Fed this year have also been characterized as \u201cinsurance cuts\u201d meant to extend the recovery and protect an economy that is in a \u201cgood place.\u201d\n\nBut regardless of the intention, the steps taken this year to reduce rates and now to expand the balance sheet may amount to an unwinding of the monetary policy adjustments made last year, some investors say. If the Fed reduces interest rates twice more this year, it would completely undo the four interest rate hikes passed in 2018.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s effectively quantitative easing. Investors should look at this as yes, a complete reversal of Fed policy from a year ago,\u201d said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. \u201cIt confirms to investors that the Fed has their back. They\u2019ll do whatever it takes to keep the U.S. financial system calm.\u201d\n\nPowell and other policymakers stress that the messaging is important. The Fed chair said Tuesday that the balance sheet expansion \u201cshould in no way be confused\u201d with the asset purchases made during the financial crisis.\n\nMinneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari echoed that message in New York Friday morning. He said that the central bank would be operating with a large balance sheet \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nAnd he was careful to point out that purchases of short-term Treasury bills are different from purchases of long-term bonds.\n\n\u201cQE was designed to also move long rates by us buying long- term assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Fed is buying short-term bills just to provide liquidity to the system, there is nothing QE about that.\u201d", "description": "Stop with the \"50 Bs.\" Start with the 60.", "authors": ["Howard Schneider", "Ann Saphir", "Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439862568&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A27U-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
