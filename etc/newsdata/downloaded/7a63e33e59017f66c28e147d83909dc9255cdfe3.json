After opening slightly higher, the index tumbled on reports that House Democratic leaders plan to hold an all-caucus meeting Tuesday to discuss whether to pursue the impeachment of President Trump.\n\nStocks then pared some of those losses after Mr. Trump said he would release a transcript of a call with the Ukrainian president that has come under fire in recent days.\n\nBy day's end, the Dow fell 142 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index slid 1.5%.\n\nReports have suggested Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will announce this afternoon that she is directing an impeachment inquiry, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Dow had risen as much as 129 points. Tuesday was one of the most volatile sessions for stocks in weeks. The S&P 500 averaged a daily move of 0.2% last week, the smallest in months. Even with Tuesday's decline, the S&P 500 is up 18% for the year and less than 2% below its July record.\n\nMeanwhile, new data on consumer confidence and manufacturing added to the downbeat sentiment, intensifying worries that economic weakness elsewhere in the world could spread to the U.S.\n\nInvestors have cited strong consumer confidence as a bulwark supporting the U.S. economy, so the Conference Board's announcement that its consumer confidence index had fallen in September--and by more than economists expected--chipped away at that reason for optimism. A gauge of softening manufacturing activity across mid-Atlantic states was a disheartening sign of weakness after overall U.S. industrial production rose in August.\n\nInvestors were also parsing signs that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could be thawing. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business on Monday night that high-level talks will start again the week after next. Other media reported Chinese importers recently bought a sizable amount of U.S. soybeans, a key export that has been punished by the trade war. Farmers have urged the administration to settle the dispute as American soybean exports to China last year plunged 74% by volume.\n\nAlbert Brenner, director of asset allocation strategy at People's United Advisors, said it appears the relative calm in the market in recent days has drawn from hopes of progress on resolving some aspects of the China trade dispute, while positive economic data has also helped.\n\nBut the amount of uncertainty in the market has led People's United to reduce its position in U.S. stocks, he said.\n\n\"If the market isn't confident, the possibility that there could be significant negative reactions to news, even if it's transitory, that could occur,\" Mr. Brenner said. \"We just don't think now is the time to be having extra money on the table in risk assets, and equities in particular.\"\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up less than 0.1%, following a session of gains in Asia. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.3% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.2%.\n\n\"It's a relatively small move, and what we've seen in recent days has been relatively thin, lacking conviction,\" said Larry Hatheway, group head of investment solutions and chief economist at GAM investment. \"Market participants are facing a conflicted news environment. The markets are really treading water.\"\n\nWrite to Anna Isaac at anna.isaac@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 24, 2019 16:31 ET (20:31 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
