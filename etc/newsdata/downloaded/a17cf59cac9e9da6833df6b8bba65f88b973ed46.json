I was at my mums and found a load of tablets and took them.\n\n\"She found me on the bed foaming at the mouth.\n\n\"I was taken to hospital and the staff said they didn't know how I'd survived.\n\n\"The other time I was going through some s**t and was hitting the coke hard.\n\n\"It was Christmas and the only person I saw over it was my dealer.\n\n\"I felt that s**t about myself I bought a load of tablets and washed them down with half a litre of vodka and a load of cocaine.\n\n\"I wanted to die, but I was in so much pain, so I ended up calling an ex-girlfriend who called an ambulance.\n\n\"I just felt so down and lonely, and I'd been mixing the two on a bender for two days.\"\n\nResearch by American Addiction Centres found that people who struggle with cocaine abuse often mix the drug with alcohol to reduce its negative affects such as anxiety and twitching because it's a depressant.\n\nFor Ian, using the two together was about keeping the party going - with feelings of self-worthlessness, anxiety and depression hitting him hard in the aftermath.\n\n\"I'd be taking a gram of coke and half a litre of spirits alongside it\", he said.\n\n\"You see a lot of people take cocaine to sober them up while out drinking.\n\n\"When you do both together, you become more wired.\n\n\"It wakes them up, and because it heightens your senses they feel more on it.\n\n\"They also feel able to drink more and stay up longer.\"\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\nResearch carried out in the US suggests the mixture of cocaine and alcohol could increase the risk of suicide by a factor of 16.\n\nJulia Sinclair is chairwoman of the faculty of addictions at the Royal College of Psychiatrists.\n\nShe described the combination as 'toxic'.\n\nSpeaking on BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show earlier this month, she said: \"Alcohol is a depressant, it increases the levels of Gaba (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in the brain, which is like its handbrake and makes us feel less anxious.\n\n\"You add cocaine into the mix and you have a rocket-fuelled increased impulsivity which gives people the drive to complete an act that they may not otherwise do. It's like crossing a road in front of a car speeding towards you.\"\n\nShe added: \"People are looking for what the ingredient that makes alcohol and cocaine such a toxic combo. It might be cocaethylene - but we don't know and everyone has a different response.\"\n\nAt one point in his life Ian was spending \u00a3400 a week on cocaine.\n\nHe started taking cocaine in his late teens, and a 'social' habit ended up consuming him.\n\nWorking as an air steward gave him access to cheap booze and intensified his habit.\n\n\"Whenever I landed, I would pick up a bottle of vodka from duty free and the first thing I'd do when I got home was a line of cocaine then pour myself a vodka and coke,\" he said.\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\n\"But it wasn't a case of having a drink and one or two lines.\n\n\"I used to go out on binges that would last days,\" he added.\n\n\"But the comedown is horrible. You feel alone, depressed, weak and disappointed with yourself, like there's nothing to look forward to.\n\n\"I remember when I was in my heyday, living it up - I had everything going for me.\n\n\"I was flying around the world, I had a beautiful girlfriend, and after a binging session I lay there in bed thinking I had nothing and questioning what I had to look forward to.\n\n\"I used to get really low.\n\n\"All of your feelings and emotions would be heightened, but whatever goes up has to come down.\n\n\"It's like a vicious cycle. You feel like s*** so what do you do, take some more.\"\n\nIan is now 14 months clean, and has started counselling others in similar situations, using his own experience to help some of them kick the habit.\n\nHe has also started his own business - Bee Prepared Ltd - which launched earlier this month in Wilmslow, offering services such as funeral plans and wills.\n\nIan added: \"I've got my focus back, the lead in my pencil again.\"\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
