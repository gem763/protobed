Apparently, free speech is no longer a civil right. Who knew?\n\n\u201cI Have a Dream\u201d would be erased from our collective memory. A former slave, by the name of Frederick Douglass, would be unknown.\n\nOur nation\u2019s historical fight for human equality would\u2019ve been impossible without the liberating power of the First Amendment.\n\nToday, that very freedom is threatened as the Left censors and deplatforms ideological opponents, mainly Christians and conservatives. Big Tech engages in what I call Jim Crow 2.0\u2014reshaping platforms to be more separated and unequal. And civil rights organizations, like the NAACP and NAACP Legal Defense Fund, are praising the censorship under the false pretenses of \u201chate speech.\u201d\n\nFacebook has suppressed my speech repeatedly (here, here, and here).\n\nI was also sued, ironically, by the pro-abortion NAACP for truthfully parodying their name in an article entitled, \u201cThe National Association for the Abortion of Colored People.\u201d NAACP executives absurdly claimed they\u2019ve never taken a position on abortion as their president at the time, Benjamin Jealous, was headlining a $1000-a-ticket fundraiser for Planned Parenthood. We won this free speech case after a surreal two years in federal court.\n\nBut Americans are losing this sacred right one social media platform at a time.\n\nFacebook\u2019s founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, recently tried to cast his company as a defender of freedom of expression in a Georgetown University speech. Instead, he delivered contradictions, conflations and little credibility. He awkwardly tied his $16.9 billion company to the rich self-sacrificial legacy of the civil rights movement, providing situations that actually belie his confused narrative.\n\nZuckerberg invoked Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s Letter from Birmingham Jail to bolster his \u201cdedication to free speech.\u201d King was jailed because infamous segregationist Bull O\u2019Connor got an unconstitutional injunction against all free speech protests in the city. King denounced local clergymen who considered him an outsider: \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d\n\nYet, Facebook decided to suppress the voices of \u201coutsiders\u201d when it came to Ireland\u2019s 2018 Abortion Referendum. Back in July, Zuckerberg boasted about blocking American pro-life organizations from using their voices in the global community.\n\nKing\u2019s legacy is firmly rooted in a robust First Amendment; Facebook regularly undermines it.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, NAACP Legal Defense Fund President, wasn\u2019t buying what Zuckerberg\u2019s speech was selling. But she offered her own plate of propaganda in her Washington Post Op-ed, Mark Zuckerberg Doesn\u2019t Know His Civil Rights History: \u201cWhat Zuckerberg failed to note is that King was the subject of violent assaults (and finally assassination) that were the result of the same kind of hate-fueled disinformation campaigns that infect the Internet and are now aimed at a different generation of civil rights leaders.\u201d What Ifill fails to note is how she defines \u201chate\u201d and actual \u201cdisinformation\u201d and that 2019 is nothing like the 1960s. None of today\u2019s civil rights leaders are targets of violent assaults or assassinations. Pretending so diminishes the sacrifices many made before us so that humanity would change.\n\nIfill continued her anti-free-speech revisionist history: \u201cThe civil rights movement was not fought to vindicate free speech rights under the First Amendment.\u201d There could never have been a civil rights movement without the First Amendment.\n\nZuckerberg invoked powerful, yet incomplete, words from Frederick Douglass who called free speech \u201cthe great moral renovator of society\u201d and that \u201cslavery cannot tolerate free speech.\u201d But Douglass\u2019 prescient 1860 speech actually illuminates the criminality of Facebook\u2019s daily censorship: \u201cEqually clear is the right to hear. To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker. It is just as criminal to rob a man of his right to speak and hear as it would be to rob him of his money.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlavery cannot tolerate free speech.\u201d Amen! Neither can \u201cprogressivism.\u201d Neither can LGBTQ activism. Neither can pro-abortion feminism. Neither can fake civil rights.\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing that the NAACP and NAACP LDF see the First Amendment as the civil wrong and censorship as a human right.\n\n\u201cFacebook had been a particularly useful tool in a misinformation campaign that targeted African-Americans more than any other voters,\u201d Ifill accuses. She\u2019s referring to the nefarious \u201cRussian meddling\u201d in our elections. The NAACP even launched a #LogOutFacebook campaign decrying voter suppression (despite decades of significantly increasing minority voter turnout) and demanding that \u201cusers of color have a right to be protected from propaganda and misinformation.\u201d First of all, we\u2019re all \u201cusers of color.\u201d Secondly, how infantilizing! African-Americans can\u2019t critically think and come to reasoned conclusions?\n\nThe NAACP and NAACP LDF are not interested in protecting the \u201cblack\u201d vote, but the liberal \u201cblack\u201d vote. In responding to their role in Facebook\u2019s one-sided \u201cCivil Rights Audit\u201d, NAACP President Derrick Johnson demanded that social media platforms prevent \u201cbad agents\u201d from \u201cspreading misinformation and further disenfranchise people of color.\u201d In the very next sentence, Johnson goes on to spread misinformation: \u201cFor millions of African-Americans and people of color, the results of the 2016 election have been detrimental to our very livelihood.\u201d\n\nUnder the Trump administration, blacks and Hispanics have the lowest unemployment rates (5.5% and 3.9%, respectively) ever recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Poverty rates for African-Americans (which hit 27.5% in 2011 during the Obama administration\u2014the highest rate in decades) are lower under Trump (20.8%) than under Obama (21.8%). HBCUs have received more taxpayer dollars than under any previous President ($32 million more than under Obama). According to Pew Research, minority voter turnout in 2018 was the highest it\u2019s been since 1978. Among eligible voters, here are the percentages of those within each \u201cracial\u201d category who voted: 57.% white, 51.4% black, 40.4% Hispanic, 40.2% Asian. In 1990, only 40.2% of eligible black voters voted.\n\nThe real suppression going on is that of the truth. And the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (Crooked Propaganda) is helping to lead the way.", "description": "The NAACP has forgotten its history.
