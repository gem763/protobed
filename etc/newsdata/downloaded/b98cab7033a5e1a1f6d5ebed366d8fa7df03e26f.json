(CSE:BOG) Changes its Name to Primo Nutraceuticals Inc. (CSE:PRMO)", "language": "en", "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 24, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BOUGAINVILLE VENTURES INC. (CSE: BOG) (FSE: 8BV) (DEU: 8BV) (MUN: 8BV) (STU: 8BV) (\"Bougainville\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it changed its name on October 24th, 2019 from Bougainville Ventures Inc. to Primo Nutraceuticals Inc. (\u201cPrimo\u201d) and will be changing their ticker symbol on the CSE from BOG to PRMO.\n\n\n\nThe company has been issued a new ISIN for its common shares: CA74167D1050. Shareholders that have their shares held electronically or in Book Entry form will have their old shares in Bougainville Ventures Inc. with ISIN CA1013981057 automatically changed. There is no action required. Shareholders that hold paper certificates should forward them to the Integral Transfer Agency to be issued a new certificate.\n\nThe change in name better reflects the industries and operating verticals of the company, and further cements the company\u2019s nutraceutical focus. The word \u201cPrimo\u201d is derived from the word \u201cPremium\u201d which means: of exceptional quality or greater value than others of its kind. Use of the word \u201cPrimo\u201d as cultural vernacular when referring to the quality of products, often cannabis, has been historically common, and is a tradition that lives on today.\n\nPrimo Nutraceuticals Inc., - Cannabis & Hemp Production, Processing, Retail & Branding\n\nAfter a year of developing assets the board of directors decided a name change to better reflect their corporate pursuits was essential to communicate potential shareholder value. Given the recent corporate activity, including marquee acquisitions and milestones in the hemp & nutraceutical sectors, the change in name is reflective of the current corporate vision. The objective of the company is to be a vertically integrated market leader, and to maintain control of quality from the seed to sale of premium products.\n\nProduction & Processing \u2013 Primo currently has production and processing operations in Oroville WA, and Newburg, Oregon. The Oroville campus has a Tier-3 tenant grower who is licensed to produce a 30,000 sq ft facility as well as a processing license that allows it to process marijuana into flower, pre-rolls, edibles, drinks and topicals. The Oregon farm has 10 acres of hemp currently being harvested. Further, a 15,000 sq ft processing facility is under construction and will house a drying and storage facility, which is a necessary first step in fulfilling the business mandate of processing hemp.\n\nRetail & Branding \u2013 With the acquisition of Thrive Wellness and the appointment of Mr. Andy Dhaliwal to the position of Vice President of Distribution and Sales, the Board is looking forward to \u201cThrive Wellness\u201d and \u201cPrimo\u201d brands being well received by customers, brokers, and retail partners such as Nutrition House. Management intends on building a corporate roadmap to further vertically integrate the company, specifically by way of \u201cPrimo\u201d branded retail outlets - offering Thrive, Primo, and a selection of curated partner brands.\n\nPresident, Andy Jagpal Comments:\n\n\u201cBougainville was the name of the previous mining business and has a related connotation for some, however, mining is unrelated to the company. Bougainville is also the name of an island in the pacific chain that the company is unrelated to. The company is proud to rebrand itself to better align shareholder expectations with corporate vision and to better reflect our business model and brand name in the cannabis and hemp market.\u201d\n\nVP Sales & Distribution, Andy Dhaliwal Comments:\n\n\u201cI believe having our company name clearly representative of the corporate portfolio to be essential in communicating our value to shareholders. This change in identity further solidifies our commitment to being the premium choice for high-value hemp nutraceutical products.\u201d\n\nAbout the CBD Market\n\nBank of America projects a spend of $1.3 Billion on CBD in Canada by 2022, while $1.9 Billion is being spent in the USA currently, and another $4.4 Billion in Europe this year.
