A short extension might focus minds in the British parliament.\n\nBREXIT DELAY\n\nBrexit was initially supposed to have taken place on March 29 but Johnson\u2019s predecessor Theresa May was forced to delay twice - first to April 12 and then to Oct. 31 - as parliament defeated her Brexit deal by margins of between 58 and 230 votes earlier this year.\n\nJohnson was forced by parliament on Saturday to send a letter to European Council President Donald Tusk requesting a delay until Jan. 31. He did so reluctantly, sending an unsigned photocopied note, but the correspondence was accepted.\n\n\u201cOur policy remains that we should not delay,\u201d Johnson told parliament on Tuesday after parliament defeated his extremely tight legislative timetable for ratifying the deal he clinched in Brussels a week ago.\n\nThere is broad consensus among the EU 27 that a delay is needed but an EU official said several member states had shared concerns voiced by France, in particular on the lack of clarity of what purpose the extension would serve.\n\n\u201cFrance is not convinced by the idea of a long extension, and the 27 are looking to find an agreement by the end of the week,\u201d a senior French diplomat said. \u201cSeveral countries are reluctant, such as the Netherlands and Poland.\u201d\n\nPoland said it wanted to avoid a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAn EU diplomat said that while no decision had yet been taken, the bloc would grant one. EU ambassadors meet on Friday to discuss a Brexit delay.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cUnanimous view is that an extension will be needed to overcome the deadlock in London and that decision should preferably be taken by written procedure - mood in the room points to a longer extension,\u201d the EU diplomat said.\n\nIreland said it supported a flexible extension - dubbed a \u201cflextension\u201d - including a break clause that would allow Brexit to take place before the deadline if Johnson won approval for his deal. Italy also supports such an extension.\n\n\u201cI think that extension will be a flexible one,\u201d Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said.", "description": "The United Kingdom will ultimately leave the European Union on the terms of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deal, a senior Downing Street source said on Thursday, as EU leaders mulled offering London a three-month flexible Brexit delay.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444468953&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0IB", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
