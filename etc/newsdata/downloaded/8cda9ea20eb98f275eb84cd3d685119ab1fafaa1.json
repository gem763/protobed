There are no substantive negotiations going on. No progress is being made because the U.K. government has tabled no proposals,\" said Hammond.\n\n\u201cI suspect the reason is that the U.K. government itself has concluded, as leaks have suggested, that there are no alternative arrangements that would be implementable on October 31 that would meet the EU\u2019s red lines and therefore anything the U.K. government does propose is likely to be rejected as unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIn a speech outside No. 10 Downing Street on Monday, Johnson issued an ultimatum to MPs attempting to change the law to prevent the U.K. from leaving the EU without a deal. He said that if MPs begin the process of passing a bill Tuesday forcing the government to request an extension from European leaders in the event of no deal, it would make negotiations \u201cabsolutely impossible.\u201d In that case, government officials briefed that Johnson could call a general election for October 14.\n\nThe former chancellor told the program he would support the bill to stop a no-deal Brexit despite whips \"threatening people, offering inducements,\" and that colleagues had come under \"immense pressure\" to back the government's position.\n\nHe confirmed he intends to stand at the next general election after being adopted last night as the Conservative candidate in his Runnymede and Weybridge constituency in southern England. And he said that Downing Street now had no mechanism to deselect him if there is an election in the next few months. \"I don't believe they do, and that would certainly be the fight of a lifetime if they tried to,\" he said. Asked if that could mean a legal battle, Hammond answered, \"possibly.\"\n\nThe former chancellor also took a veiled swipe at the prime minister\u2019s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings.\n\n\u201cI am going to defend my party against incomers, entryists, who are trying to turn it from a broad church to narrow faction,\u201d Hammond said. \u201cPeople who are at the heart of this government, who are probably not even members of the Conservative Party, who care nothing about the future of the Conservative Party, I intend to defend my party against them.\u201d\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
