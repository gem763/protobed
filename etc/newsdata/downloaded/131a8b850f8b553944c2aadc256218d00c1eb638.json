He blamed authorities\u2019 fabrication of evidence, use of torture and a general cover-up for destroying a case where real evidence existed to prosecute those responsible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very serious justice issue and because of that we\u2019re going to formally file a complaint with the attorney general\u2019s office and the judiciary in this case,\u201d said L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nAuthorities say the students from the Ayotzinapa teacher training college were abducted by police and handed over to the drug gang Guerreros Unidos. L\u00f3pez Astudillo allegedly headed the gang in Iguala.\n\nJes\u00fas Murillo Karam, attorney general under former president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, infamously announced that authorities had established the \u201chistoric truth\u201d of the students\u2019 disappearance. He said that the students were killed and their bodies incinerated at a garbage dump.\n\nBut independent experts said there was no evidence to support that conclusion, and investigators have definitively identified the remains of only one of the 43 students.\n\n\u201cThe poorly named \u2018historic truth\u2019 was built with a foundation of cover-up, fabrication of evidence and torture to the benefit of the perpetrators and against the victims\u2019 rights,\u201d Encinas said. \u201cThe historic truth collides with reality.\u201d\n\nEncinas made clear Murillo Karam and other top officials involved in the case should be included in the investigation.\n\n\u201cWhat we have now are a series of trials, which are falling apart,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Luisa Aguilar, international affairs director for the Miguel Agust\u00edn Pro Ju\u00e1rez Human Rights Centre, which has worked with the students\u2019 families.\n\n\u201cThe impression the families have is that the investigators tried to shelve the investigation,\u201d she added. \u201cThey didn\u2019t do a proper investigation into what happened or the students\u2019 whereabouts \u2013 which is what the families care about most.\u201d\n\nThe UN\u2019s human rights office said in a report last year that Mexican authorities had probably tortured dozens of people during the investigation.\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s popularity suffered lasting damage from the scandal over the disappearances, and his government was heavily criticized for its handling of the investigation.", "description": "L\u00f3pez Obrador makes announcement following release of alleged leader of local drug gang believed to have killed the students", "authors": ["David Agren"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cac0b3c35fc7fa6fc08e9757e1bdd691a76e496/0_302_4528_2716/master/4528.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=87030f5150a31bfd429ed23fbcdc0308"}
