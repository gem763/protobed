They also obtained grade-point averages, SAT scores, phone numbers, ethnicities and other private information about every elementary, middle and high school student in the area.\n\nNone of the data accessed was tampered with, Mattei said, and no Social Security numbers or credit card information for students or parents was available for perusing. But the data taken could have been used for identity theft, district spokeswoman Jennifer Shealy told The Washington Post, although she added that administrators do not think the attack was malicious.\n\nWith an investigation ongoing, the district has yet to decide on a punishment.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere are consequences to students\u2019 actions,\u201d Shealy said. \u201cHowever, we do know that these are students, they\u2019re kids \u2014 so it\u2019s balancing that.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe suspects have not been publicly identified, and the district is not saying how many are thought to have participated. Administrators said they started investigating the hacks after finding out on Oct. 11 about an attempt to compromise accounts for a site called Naviance, which provides college and career resources.\n\nThe hack was allegedly carried out as part of \u201csenior water games,\u201d Shealy said. It\u2019s a local tradition modeled after \u201cAssassin,\u201d in which players typically try to eliminate one another over the course of days. The district is aware of the game and has told students not to play it on school property, Shealy said.\n\nAD\n\nTeenagers have been known to go to extremes for the sake of an \u201cAssassin\u201d win: Police in New Hampshire once weighed criminal charges, including reckless driving, after students got into a car crash while playing.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStudents get caught up in the act of the game and they forget common sense,\u201d said police Lt. Dean Killkelley of Merrimack, N.H., according to local station WCVB.\n\nMore schools are also becoming victims of big hacks perpetrated by students. Their systems tend to be easy targets, according to one teenager who has made it his mission to scout out and raise awareness of the vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cThe state of cybersecurity in education software is really bad, and not enough people are paying attention to it,\u201d Bill Demirkapi told Wired, explaining how he\u2019d found bugs in popular school software that left 5 million records exposed.\n\nAD\n\nA recent data breach at a Maryland high school involved Naviance, just like Downingtown\u2019s hack. A student used what\u2019s called a \u201cbrute force attack\u201d \u2014 an automated attempt to guess login credentials \u2014 to download GPAs, test scores, contact information and even nicknames for about 1,400 peers, according to cybersecurity site SC Media.\n\nAD\n\nNaviance blocked the suspicious activity within hours, SC Media reported, but it was too late. The illegally obtained information was allegedly shared with other students.\n\nShealy said cybersecurity is \u201ca constant concern\u201d for the Downingtown school district. All employees and students are changing their passwords after the breach, she said, and administrators are taking other steps to prevent a repeat.\n\nShealy declined to elaborate on those measures, though, saying she doesn\u2019t want to give any future hackers clues.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "They obtained GPAs, SAT scores, phone numbers, addresses and more, administrators say.
