Robert Evans Said Yes Anyway.", "language": "en", "text": "Appraising the contribution of the former Paramount Pictures executive Robert Evans is an act complicated not, as some may argue, by the well- and less-known facts and rumors of his private life \u2014 the cocaine, the women, the murder of one of the investors in a movie Mr. Evans produced, \u201cThe Cotton Club\u201d (he was not charged) \u2014 but by the very complicated definition of \u201cproducer.\u201d A producer and friend once told me, \u201cThe producer is the person who would do anything to get the movie made \u2014 and does.\u201d\n\nFor several years Mr. Evans, who died on Saturday at 89, stood in the role of a studio head while playing the part of a relentless producer who would do anything to get the movie made \u2014 and did, many times, to the point of ruining marriages.\n\nAnd many times, the movies he made were among Hollywood\u2019s greatest ever.\n\n\u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d \u2014 no one would argue against them. But one might ask, \u201cHow responsible was Robert Evans for their greatness?\u201d That is the right question. I don\u2019t mean to be coy or opaque, but the answer is, paradoxically, entirely and not at all. Mr. Evans was not at all responsible to a degree that I think is easy to see: Great movies are great art made by great artists, and he was no artist. As much as he tried, somewhat pitifully, to flaunt the latent producer in him and claim credit for Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s tremendous postproduction effort on \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d the truth was the victory belonged, of course, to the director (and Mr. Coppola\u2019s team at the production company American Zoetrope).\n\nBut \u2014 and here\u2019s the other half of the paradox \u2014 Mr. Evans, the head of production, said yes to it. \u201cYes\u201d is only one word, but when you\u2019re running Paramount at a time when the industry is in serious financial decline and trying to decide whether you\u2019re going to release a very long cut of a gangster movie (with an unknown for a leading man) that wasn\u2019t really a gangster movie, \u201cyes\u201d is a very expensive word indeed.", "description": "The former Paramount Pictures executive wasn\u2019t an artist, but he recognized artistry (and commercial potential) in others.", "authors": ["Sam Wasson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/opinion/30Wasson/30Wasson-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
