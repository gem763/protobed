Today we have an interview I conducted with Micah Hanks, a journalist who has delved deep into this subject (along with many others) for a number of years. He\u2019s a lecturer, the author of multiple books and the host of The Micah Hanks Program (formerly known as The Gralien Report), among other interests and podcasts:\n\nIn a rather wide-ranging discussion, Micah and I talk about how the Navy videos originally came to light, some of Michio Kaku\u2019s recent comments on government accountability and what we know thus far about the technology being displayed by these unusual objects in our skies. (Or at least what the experts think we know about it anyway.) Micah is a smart guy who brings a lot to the table on this subject and I hope you enjoy the interview.", "description": "The truth may or may not be out there", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MicahHanks2.jpg"}
