Huawei has repeatedly denied such allegations.\n\nThe sanctions cut off Huawei's access to essential U.S. technologies. The latest version of its Mate 30 flagship phone, unveiled last week in Europe, will not come with Google Mobile Services.\n\nRen's remarks come after he said this month that he is open to selling the firm's 5G technology - including patents, code, blueprints and production know-how - to Western firms for a one-off fee.\n\nThe offer to license out 5G technology marks the latest attempt by Huawei, also the world's No.2 smartphone vendor, to minimize the impact of the U.S. trade ban. It expects a hit of some $10 billion to revenue from its phone business this year.\n\n(Reporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Jason Neely and Edwina Gibbs)", "description": "Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei told reporters he was not afraid of creating a rival by making Huawei's technology available to competitors", "authors": ["Sijia Jiang"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cc61d2e22af59ea267f93-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
