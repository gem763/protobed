They walked by faith and now we invoke their intercession,\u201d the papal tweet ran.\n\nCommenting on the gaffe, Reuters noted that \u201csome saints wear halos, other saints wear helmets.\u201d\n\nThe mistake was easy enough to make. The Vatican staff who handle the pope\u2019s official Twitter account in English obviously typed in the hashtag #Saints and the first option to appear is the hashtag for the football team, complete with the fleur-de-lis icon.\n\nOn Sunday, Francis canonized five new Catholic saints, including the English convert and cardinal, John Henry Newman. Some 50,000 people filled Saint Peter\u2019s Square for the pope\u2019s blessing following the canonization Mass.\n\nFrancis has been an avid user of social media, setting up Twitter accounts in different languages from early in his pontificate. A 2015 study proclaimed the pope to be the most influential person on Twitter for the third year in a row.\n\nBut despite his own success on social media, Francis remains skeptical of its real influence and has warned young people about the virtual reality of social media.\n\n\u201cIn the social media, we see faces of young people appearing in any number of pictures recounting more or less real events, but we don\u2019t know how much of all this is really \u2018history,\u2019 an experience that can be communicated and endowed with purpose and meaning,\u201d Francis said in a 2017 message to youth.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "Pope Francis tweeted out thanks for newly canonized saints Sunday, but mistakenly used the hashtag of the New Orleans Saints football team.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
