Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joe Biden shared the debate stage.\n\nWarren and Biden exhibited stark differences on style, policy and vision for the Democratic Party, embodying two opposing theories of what the party should be.\n\nDEBATE DESCENDS INTO MELEE OVER HEALTH CARE, OBAMA, SOCIALISM AS DEMS STRUGGLE TO SHOW UNITY\n\nThis divide was apparent during an explosive debate over health care, during which Biden went on the attack against Warren, D-Mass., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for the hidden costs associated with their \u201cMedicare-for-all plans.\u201d\n\nWarren deflected when asked if middle-class taxes will go up to pay for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d saying total costs would go down \u2013 but not explicitly stating whether taxes for middle-class families would increase.\n\n\u201cWhat we're talking about here is what's going to happen in families' pockets,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cThis is about candor, honesty,\u201d Biden retorted. \u201cThere will be a deductible \u2013 in your paycheck ... someone making 60 grand with three kids, they're going to end up paying $5,000 more.\u201d\n\nThough many were watching Warren expecting her to deliver a knockout performance, the senator fell somewhat short of that expectation. While this will likely not impact Warren\u2019s standing in the presidential race at this early stage \u2013 which according to most polls is a close second behind Biden \u2013 she did not have the debate moment that many were anticipating.\n\nAside from Biden\u2019s generally strong performance, he compellingly and convincingly delivered his core message of restoring, protecting and rebuilding the Obama-Biden record.\n\nOn the other hand, the first 30 minutes of the debate during the health care discussion were arguably Biden\u2019s best moments on the campaign trail to date. Though the former vice president\u2019s performance was not perfect, he exhibited a much-needed display of strength and preparedness.\n\nAside from Biden\u2019s generally strong performance, he compellingly and convincingly delivered his core message of restoring, protecting and rebuilding the Obama-Biden record.\n\n\u201cThe senator says she's for Bernie. Well, I'm for Barack,\u201d Biden said about Warren's support for \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d referencing last month\u2019s debate, when Warren said she completely agreed with Sanders on \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d\n\nAt the previous debate, several progressive candidates took aim at former President Obama\u2019s legacy on health care as a way to attack Biden on his record.\n\nHowever, in a marked reversal, both Warren and Sen. Kamala Harris of California \u2013 who sharply criticized Obama in the last debate \u2013 praised the former president for the positive systematic changes to health care that came as a result of ObamaCare.\n\nIndeed, if there was an absentee winner of the debate, it was Obama. Aside from Biden, one of the clearest, and most concise health care arguments came from Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has polled consistently in the low single-digits and had yet to have a strong debate moment before Thursday night.\n\nKlobuchar said that although Sanders may have written the \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d bill, she \u201cactually read the bill,\u201d noting that under Sanders\u2019 plan \u201cwe will no longer have private insurance as we know it\u201d \u2013 resulting in millions of Americans losing their private insurance.\n\nSimilar to previous debates, the discussion of immigration had Biden on the defensive over the 3 million undocumented immigrants that were deported under the Obama administration.\n\nFormer Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, in particular, took aim at Biden, using the moment to attack Biden for \u201ctaking credit\u201d for positive elements of the Obama legacy and distancing himself from criticism.\n\n\u201cHe wants to take credit for Obama's work but not have to answer any questions,\u201d Castro said of Biden.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThese attacks largely fell flat, as did Castro\u2019s attempted jab at Biden\u2019s age, and will surely not result in a post-debate polling spike for Castro that other candidates have experienced after attacking Biden during a debate.\n\n\u201cI stand with Barack Obama all eight years \u2013 good, bad, and indifferent,\u201d Biden said in response to the immigration attacks, once again reverting to his campaign message of restoring, protecting and rebuilding the Obama-Biden record.\n\nAside from Castro\u2019s attacks, throughout the entire night Sanders was the candidate who attacked Biden the most. He went after the former vice president not just on health care, but also on corporations, Biden\u2019s vote in favor of the Iraq war as a senator, and trade.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut while Sanders was one of the more vocal candidates, he did not deliver the performance he needed to in order to pull ahead of Biden or Warren in the polls.\n\nUltimately, Biden\u2019s impressive \u2013 though not perfect \u2013 performance was a much-needed display of strength and preparedness and will likely solidify his frontrunner status.\n\nCLEAR HERE TO READ MORE BY DOUGLAS SCHOEN", "description": "The top three candidates -- Biden, Warren and Sanders -- clashed for the first time on one stage in Thursday night, giving starkly different .proposals on the path Democrats should take.", "authors": ["Douglas Schoen", "Douglas E.
