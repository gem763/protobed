Now Comes the Hard Part.", "language": "en", "text": "One 886-bed jail will tower over shops and restaurants in Downtown Brooklyn. Another will be next to a subway yard in Queens. In the Bronx, a jail will replace a Police Department tow pound. And another jail will rise in the shadow of City Hall in Manhattan.\n\nThat is at the heart of a plan for a landmark overhaul of New York City\u2019s corrections system, which will culminate with the closing of Rikers Island, the jail complex with nearly 10,000 beds that has become notorious for chronic abuse, neglect and mismanagement.\n\nThe City Council decisively approved the proposal on Thursday, taking a step that seemed improbable just a few years ago. Supporters say the plan places New York City at the forefront of a national movement to reverse decades of mass incarceration that disproportionately affected black and Hispanic people.\n\nStill, the aggressive timeline \u2014 closing Rikers by 2026 \u2014 could prove very challenging.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, embraced the jails plan, throwing their political weight behind the measure despite steady opposition from neighborhoods whose residents worry that towering new jails will harm their quality of life. Corrections officers also criticized the plan as unrealistic.", "description": "The City Council approved a sweeping $8 billion plan to close the troubled jail complex and replace it with four smaller jails by 2026, an aggressive timeline that will prove challenging.", "authors": ["Matthew Haag"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/nyregion/18rikers1-print/17rikers01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
