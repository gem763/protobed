Particularly given the conversation that\u2019s surrounded the Braves recently. A Cardinals pitcher of Native American descent objected to the Braves\u2019 infamous tomahawk chop and the team responded Wednesday by toning down its use of the chop.

How do people get away from this racist crap in 2019.https://t.co/vB4nTAHNOC \u2014 Mike Wise (@MikeWiseguy) October 10, 2019\n\nYahoo Sports reached out to KTVU for its response to the outrage but the station hasn\u2019t yet replied. This is, however, not the first time the station has been condemned publicly for being racially insensitive.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Braves were eliminated from the MLB postseason and Bay Area news station botches its headline", "authors": ["Mike Oz"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/HgyCAxaMO2CDW4VyEHoL0Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTIuMjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Nw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zJSNm2DdGdQrJXCXiwaxPA--~B/aD0zMjA2O3c9NDgxNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f6698210-eb0e-11e9-bf9f-0a7026f881fd", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
