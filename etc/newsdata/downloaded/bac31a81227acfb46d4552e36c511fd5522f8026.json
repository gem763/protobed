(DOW) , which is turning itself around and has an impressive 5.7% yield.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of DOW, below, we can see that prices have turned up above the now rising 20-day and 50-day moving average lines. Because we only have a limited amount of price history we shortened our moving averages from 50- and 200 to just 20- and 50-days.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line bottomed in May and has been rising since then telling us that buyers of DOW have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has turned up above the zero line this month for an outright go long signal. Stepping back from the chart we can see that a small, three-month base has been made.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of DOW, below, we can see the recent upside breakout at $50.01 and the potential price objective of $57.\n\nBottom line strategy: We do not have a lot of price history to work with but DOW has made a workable three-month base that can support further price gains. Traders could long DOW around $50 or better risking below $46 for now. $57 and $60 are our first upside price targets.", "description": "Let's check out a couple of charts of DOW....DOW", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Dow Inc Is Poised To Rally After Making A Three-Month Base", "Let'S Check Out A Couple Of Charts Of Dow.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "James", "Rev Shark", "Gary Berman", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e7b564df-5550-11e9-a10a-c5965889ae39.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
