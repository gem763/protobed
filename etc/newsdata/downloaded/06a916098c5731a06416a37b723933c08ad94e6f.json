You've got trouble getting into bed, trouble getting your socks on.\n\n\"Just deal with it. That's who you are now. You're a drooling, limping has-been! Get on with it. Enjoy it.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBilly opened up about living with the disease in a recent documentary, and he said he's not scared of dying.\n\nHe said on the show: \"It doesn't frighten me - it's an adventure and it's quite interesting to see myself slipping away, as bits slip off and leave me, talents leave and attributes leave.\n\n\"It's as if I'm being prepared for something, some other adventure, which is over the hill. I've got all this stuff to lose first, and then I'll be at the shadowy side of the hill doing the next episode in the spirit world.\"\n\nBilly's diagnosis also saw him fall out with long term friend Sir Michael Parkinson, after he said Billy was so ill he could no longer recognise his friends.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLast year, the comic was forced to hit back at Parky's coments.\n\nThe funnyman said he was disappointed by his friend and worried about people reading the papers and feeling sorry for him.\n\nHe told the Radio Times : \"These Yorkshiremen, I don\u2019t think they apologise much.\n\n\"I wasn\u2019t disappointed, it just made my life a bit difficult. People feeling sorry for me, I don\u2019t like that.\"\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nHe added: \"They read about me in the papers and think, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s not well.\u2019 They\u2019re right, but I\u2019m not as bad as they think I am.\n\n\"He should get on with selling funerals and leave me alone.\"\n\nBilly and his wife Pamela had previously blasted Parky, calling him a \"daft old fart\" after what he said about the comic.\n\nBilly said at the time: \"I would recognise Parky if he was standing behind me - in a diving suit.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
