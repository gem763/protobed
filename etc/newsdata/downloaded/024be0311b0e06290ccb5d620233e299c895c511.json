Shortly after she met Tom, and the pair later got engaged (pictured)\n\nAfter 18 months of long-distance romance, Alyssa and Tom tied the knot at their April wedding (pictured)\n\nAlyssa and Tom on holiday for his 30th in September 2018 - the month after they got engaged (pictured together)\n\n'If you'd told me as I walked to the date that evening that I'd have ended up marrying the man I was about to meet, I'd have thought you were crazy,' she explained.\n\n'I had no expectations, then when Tom showed up, not only was he way better looking than his photos, but everything he said about life, work, and travel, showed he was made for me.\n\n'I was speechless \u2013 and that never happens to me. It's been such a whirlwind, but anybody that knows Tom and me, and sees us together, knows how special what we have is.'\n\nBefore the trip that changed her life, Alyssa had been busy working in software sales in Los Angeles, where she had joined several dating apps in a bid to meet Mr Right, but had never felt that special chemistry with any of her beaus.\n\nShe explained: 'Out in LA, everyone is on every app, but there's very much this view of, 'If you're not first choice, you're last.'\n\n'It felt like people were always looking for a better option, so they'd be flaky, act distracted on dates, or sometimes even not show up.\n\nAlyssa was on an 11 day work trip to London - 5,500 miles from home - when she and her pal decided to go on a few dates in their spare time. Pictured, one of the first photos taken of Alyssa and Tom\n\nAlyssa told how she had some nice dates in LA, but they never went any further. Pictured, with Tom on a trip to Big Sur, California\n\n'Don't get me wrong, I had some nice dates too and met great guys \u2013 but they were all just first dates. Nothing felt like it'd be my last.'\n\nThat was until her 11 day work trip to London - 5,500 miles from home - in March 2017, where she and her colleague, who is also a pal, decided to go on a few dates in their spare time.\n\nFiring up the app Bumble, which has three modes \u2013 Date, for relationships, which is the one she chose, Bizz for professional networking and BFF to find friendship - she started looking through.\n\n'Our thinking was, \"Why not?\" We were only there for 11 days,' she said.\n\n'At first, there was nobody I was really clicking with on Bumble, then on the second to last day, I matched with Tom.\n\n'We arranged to meet that night at the Ace Hotel in Shoreditch, in the east of the city. I even brought my colleague along, which he didn't actually know was happening. But he was great and put up with the two of us interviewing him very well.'\n\nCompletely blown away by Tom, Alyssa was delighted when, at the end of the night, he agreed to see her again the next day - her last before she was due to fly home.\n\nThe next night, the trio met again, and this time Tom brought a friend, too - another Tom, who, coincidentally, ended up being best man at their wedding.\n\n'The four of us had such an amazing time and I got to know my Tom more,' recalled Alyssa. 'As we parted ways, he said he could tell there was something between us, and we agreed to keep speaking once I was back in LA.\n\n'He said to let him know if I was ever back over in London and, by chance, I'd already booked a trip to travel around Europe that July and August.\n\n'Right then and there, he invited me to stay with him at the end of it, and I accepted. It felt right.'\n\nOn their third meeting for his birthday, Tom told her he loved her too. Pictured, the now husband and wife in Yosemite\n\nFor Alyssa, the light bulb moment came when she realised she'd rather take a 10 hour flight to London to see him again than a 10 minute cab ride to date a man in her area. Pictured, Alyssa and Tom in Cardiff, Wales for a wedding in July 2018\n\nAfter unexpectedly falling hard for Tom, Alyssa found it difficult to leave him behind, as she took off for the US.\n\nBut they continued to speak, initially once a week, but before long, that had moved up to nightly phone calls, which could be tricky, given the eight-hour time difference.\n\n'All I wanted to do was talk to Tom \u2013 I was really falling for him,' explained Alyssa. 'The true light bulb moment came when I realised I'd rather take a 10 hour flight to London to see him again than a 10 minute cab ride to date a man in my area.'\n\nIn August 2017, Alyssa and Tom met in person once again, when she went to stay with him in London for 10 days at the end of a European trip - meeting his family and friends and telling him she loved him for the first time.\n\nThe moment she landed back in Los Angeles, she booked another flight to London for the following month, September, so she could be there to celebrate Tom's 29 birthday.\n\n'I knew then that it was love,' she said. 'I didn't want him to spend another birthday without me.'\n\nAnd this remarkably romantic act persuaded Tom that Alyssa was no holiday fling - instead he saw her as his future wife and, on their third meeting for his birthday, he told her he loved her too.\n\nAlyssa said: 'He hadn't said it back right away when I'd said it, as he wanted to be sure, but after I saw him for his birthday he said he knew it was love, and that he was going to marry me.'\n\nA long-distance romance ensued, with the couple using every scrap of holiday entitlement to see each other.\n\nAlyssa and Tom on his 29th birthday when she flew over to see him in September 2017 (pictured together)\n\nWhile living thousands of miles apart was tough, Alyssa believes it strengthened their bond. Pictured Alyssa and Tom in London in January 2018\n\nLuckily, Alyssa had agreed with her work to take monthly trips to London, while Tom spent two weeks in LA every three months.\n\nAnd while living thousands of miles apart was tough, Alyssa now believes that it strengthened their bond.\n\n'Tom is such a good communicator and I had so much trust in him \u2013 more than I had ever had in previous relationships,' she explained.\n\n'We agreed that, although it'd be difficult, we'd put in the hours and the effort to make it work. It didn't matter if that meant one of us staying up late or waking up early so we could talk \u2013 our relationship was our priority.\n\n'Because we weren't physically together for a lot of it, all we could do was talk, so we got to know one another slower.\n\n'The lust was almost an afterthought \u2013 though obviously overwhelming when we did see each other in person.\n\n'But Tom really is my best friend and we know absolutely everything about each other.'\n\nBy May 2018, Tom and Alyssa were ready to take things to the next level and live together.\n\nAfter talking things through, they agreed that, because he could not practice medicine in the US and she was not especially attached to living in LA, it would make sense for her to relocate.\n\nKnowing she was the one and realising it would make it easier for her to obtain a visa, Tom spoke to Alyssa's grandfather, the family patriarch, during a visit to California, and confessed that he wanted to ask her to marry him.\n\nTom spoke to Alyssa's grandfather during a visit to California, and confessed that he wanted to ask her to marry him.

Pictured together in New York for NYE 2018\n\n'I'd never seen myself as somebody who would get married,' she said. 'But when Tom told me that he had spoken to my grandfather, it was a surprisingly comfortable conversation.\n\n'In fact, I'd been so convinced I wouldn't ever get married that I repeatedly asked my dad, who has been saving for my wedding for years, if I could just have the money to use for something else.\n\n'Thankfully he said no and held out.'\n\nIn August 2018, Tom officially proposed to Alyssa on Parliament Hill, a lookout point on Hampstead Heath which boasts stunning views of the city.\n\nShe continued: 'Though we'd agreed we were going to get married, I had no idea the official proposal was coming then.\n\n'It was just a random Sunday and we went for a stroll on Hampstead Heath. Given that it was a heatwave, Parliament Hill was packed with about 100 people having picnics.\n\n'Bless poor Tom, I don't think he expected having to ask in front of so many strangers. But, he said all this lovely stuff about me then got on one knee.\n\n'His best friend then appeared with this bottle of champagne, and everybody watching clapped. It was amazing.'\n\nAlyssa officially moved to London in January 2019.

Pictured, Alyssa and Tom at their April wedding\n\nAlyssa then officially moved to London in January 2019, before the pair had a small ceremony in front of 30 of their loved ones at Islington Town Hall in north London, followed by a huge party in a pub with 120 guests.\n\nNow legally married, she is able to continue living and working in the UK and lives with Tom in Canonbury, north London.\n\nSo that everybody that could not come to the April ceremony has a chance to celebrate, they are also throwing a big wedding party on the Italian island of Sicily next summer.\n\nSettling into married life, which she said is blissful, Alyssa, who now works for a different software company based in London, continues to marvel at how a chance swipe on Bumble and a first date, which her friend came on too, ended up bagging her a husband.\n\nShe concluded: 'Married life is so much fun. Tom's family and friends are wonderful. They have adopted me into the British side of the family.\n\n'Our families both get on brilliantly too, which is lovely. Our dads especially have such a bromance \u2013 Tom's dad is basically the British version of mine.\n\n'It feels crazy to look back on the past two years, but now, I am such an advocate for going out on a limb and putting yourself out there.\n\n'To those that feel fed up or like they're giving up on love, I'd say just go for it. Go on 100 dates if you have to \u2013 one will work out and lead you to the love of your life.'", "description": "Alyssa Tantillo, 29, from LA, flew to London in March 2017 to meet clients.
