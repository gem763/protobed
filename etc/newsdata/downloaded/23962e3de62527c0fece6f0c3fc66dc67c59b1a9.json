During this latest round of purges, the social network removed accounts operated from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Ecuador, and China.\n\nThese new removals come as Twitter also took down state-backed accounts part of extensive information operations back in January (Bangladesh, Iran, Russia, Venezuela), June (Iran, Spain, Venezuela), and August (China).\n\nJust like it did before, Twitter has made the information about these accounts and their tweets public and downloadable for research and academic purposes.\n\nMore on the recent removals are available below:\n\nUnited Arab Emirates & Egypt - 267 accounts\n\nCause: \"These accounts were interconnected in their goals and tactics: a multi-faceted information operation primarily targeting Qatar, and other countries such as Iran. It also amplified messaging supportive of the Saudi government.\"\n\nTwitter said it believed the accounts were managed by DotDev, a private technology company operating in the UAE and Egypt.\n\nUnited Arab Emirates - 4,258 accounts\n\nCause: \"These accounts were often employing false personae and tweeting about regional issues, such as the Yemeni Civil War and the Houthi Movement.\"\n\nSaudi Arabia - 6 accounts\n\nCause: \"Engaged in coordinated efforts to amplify messaging that was beneficial to the Saudi government. While active, the accounts in this set presented themselves as independent journalistic outlets while tweeting narratives favourable to the Saudi government. \"\n\nTwitter said the accounts were linked to Saudi Arabia's state-run media apparatus.\n\nIn addition, Twitter also said it suspended the personal account of\n\nSaud al-Qahtani, a Saudi Arabian consultant and former royal court advisor. Twitter said the account was suspended because of \"violations of our platform manipulation policies,\" and that it continues to suspend individual accounts for political spam, even if they're not part of a coordinated state-run operation.\n\nSpain - 259 accounts\n\nCause: \"Falsely boosting public sentiment online in Spain. [...] These accounts were active for a relatively short period, and consisted primarily of fake accounts engaging in spamming or retweet behaviour to increase engagement.\"\n\nTwitter said the accounts were linked back to Partido Popular, a right-wing conservative political party.\n\nEcuador - 1,019 accounts\n\nCause: \"The network, composed largely of fake accounts, was primarily engaged in spreading content about President Moreno's administration, focusing on issues concerning Ecuadorian laws on freedom of speech, government censorship, and technology. Tactics most commonly used were hashtag manipulation and retweet spam.\"\n\nTwitter said the accounts suspended today were tied to the PAIS Alliance political party, President Moreno's former party and the current ruling party.\n\nChina - 4,302 accounts\n\nCause: \"Sow discord about the protest movement in Hong Kong.\"\n\nTwitter said these accounts were operated by the Chinese government and are directly tied to the accounts it banned last month, in August.", "description": "Twitter removes new accounts part of state-run information campaigns in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Equador, and China.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/28/faa7d633-8f59-41f0-8f40-7793a18eda67/thumbnail/770x578/52f8481dc41912acdc6080cb292d05c1/twitter-bans-936-accounts-managed-by-the-5d637e1ae7f9cf00012c6e31-1-aug-28-2019-19-24-26-poster.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
