For serious cooks, the space off the kitchen houses a pantry.\n\nThe extension design is unique to the surrounding area and uses materials ordinarily seen in large-scale industrial buildings, adapting these to a small-scale and detailed specification.\n\nDesign: The extension design is unique to the surrounding area and uses materials ordinarily seen in large-scale industrial buildings\n\nInside out: The clever extension has been kitted out with bi-fold doors leading directly to the south-facing garden\n\nFeatures: The kitchen area is simple and highly functional, with an island and breakfast bar featuring wooden work surfaces and a butler basin\n\nWindows: The port windows are designed to let the ideal amount of light through\n\nThe front door of the property is hard to miss, with its generous scale offering a glimpse straight through into the extension. The entrance hall is just as spacious, giving the home an easy-going family feel.\n\nTammy and Stuart, the couple who had their tired 1950s bungalow and dodgy 1980s extension transformed by Alsop, decided to keep the property's original parquet floor, which now flows from the entrance hall and through to one of the bedrooms.\n\nThe main bedroom has an en-suite shower room, and all three bedrooms have a view to the garden.\n\nThe three-bedroom property, which also comes with a parking space, is located on a quiet residential road in a popular village.\n\nTammy and Stuart purchased the bungalow in 2014 for \u00a3285,000 and had a budget of \u00a350,000 to complete the renovation work.\n\nYour next home? The three-bedroom property, which also comes with a parking space, is located on a quiet residential road in a popular village\n\nSpace: The entrance hall to the West Sussex home has generous proportions\n\nFull of light: All three bedrooms look out on to the garden area\n\nSpace for all: One of the three bedrooms, currently used as a children's room\n\nFacilities: The well-designed property has three bedrooms and two bathrooms\n\nLaura Howard, of Zoopla, said: 'This unique property is proof that the days when home extensions looked like awkward bolt-ons that attempted to match the architecture of the main house, are long gone.\n\n'Whilst the beautifully refurbished semi-detached bungalow might not look particularly unusual from the front, the back reveals a jaw-dropping extension with an arched aluminium roof from award-winning architect Will Alsop. This home will surely delight even the toughest architectural critics in suburbia.\n\n'Under Permitted Development rights, which the Government made permanent in May 2019, homeowners are now able to build some extensions without applying for planning permission, making it much easier for Brits to expand their existing living space.'\n\nArchitect: The extension to the property was designed by the late Will Alsop\n\nWill Alsop, the architect who designed the property's extension, died at the age of 70 last May.\n\n'Architects are the only profession that actually deal in joy and delight \u2013 all the others deal in doom and gloom,' Alsop once said.\n\nArchitecture came to Alsop at a very young age, when he designed a house for his mother when aged only six.\n\nHe joined the foundation course at Northampton Art School, where he was influenced by Henry Bird.\n\nAlsop later graduated from the Architectural Association School of Architecture in 1973, and then founded Alsop & Lyall with friend and former classmate John Lyall.\n\nFamed for his unconventional, outlandish designs, Alsop prided himself on 'challenging architectural norms' and won the coveted RIBA Stirling Prize for his transformation of Peckham Library in south London.", "description": "While many homeowners build an extension in the hope of boosting the value of their property by thousands of pounds, not many have one with an arched aluminium roof and port windows.", "authors": ["Jane Denton For Thisismoney"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/21/16/17530824-0-image-a-72_1566400636643.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-22"}
