Zachary Terwilliger, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, right, accompanied by Assistant U.S. Attorney Danya Atiyeh, takes a question from a reporter after announcing the arrest of Henry K. Frese during a news conference. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nA Defense Intelligence Agency employee accused of sharing classified information with two reporters was released on bond in Alexandria federal court Friday.\n\nHenry K. Frese, who had a high-level security clearance, pleaded not guilty to two counts of willful transmission of national defense information. A status hearing in his case is set for Nov. 2.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of discovery in this case is classified,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Danya Atiyeh told U.S. District Court Judge Leonie M. Brinkema.\n\nFrese was arrested Wednesday morning as he arrived for work at DIA offices in Reston, Va., the FBI said. Prosecutors said the information disclosed \u201ccould reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave harm to the national security,\u201d but they did not allege any actual harm.\n\nThe indictment does not name the reporters with whom Frese is alleged to have shared classified information, but the circumstances described in court papers appear to match Amanda Macias of CNBC and Courtney Kube of MSNBC. A person familiar with the case confirmed that they are the journalists linked to the case.\n\nFrese is barred from contacting any potential witnesses or co-defendants in the case. The government has declined to say whether they intend to prosecute the two reporters.\n\n\n\nHenry K. Frese, 30, has been arrested and charged with two counts of transmitting national defense information to the media. (Alexandria Sheriff\u2019s Office)\n\nFrese\u2019s attorneys declined to comment Friday. His lead attorney, Sean Buckley, has prosecuted terrorism cases in the Southern District of New York.\n\nAccording to the court records, the DIA began investigating after the publication in spring 2018 of eight stories regarding foreign countries\u2019 weapons systems. During that period, articles about Chinese and Russian weapon defense systems were published under Macias\u2019s byline.\n\nFrese was found to have used his security clearance to gain access to five classified intelligence reports referenced in the articles, even though the files were outside his job duties as a counterterrorism analyst, according to prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the court documents, FBI agents concluded after searches of public records and social media that Frese and one of the reporters, whom the person familiar with the case identified as Macias, lived together from August 2017 to August 2018 and were in a romantic relationship for at least some of that period.\n\nThey obtained a wiretap for Frese\u2019s phone, a step rarely taken in leak investigations, and subpoenaed Twitter records, court papers say.\n\nAuthorities alleged that one journalist, who has been identified as Macias, asked Frese if he would help a second reporter. He agreed, and in a call last month allegedly shared classified information with a reporter who has been identified as Kube.\n\nThe journalists and their organizations have not publicly commented on the case.\n\nRead more:\n\nHacker held in contempt for refusing to testify before WikiLeaks grand jury\n\nLawyer found guilty of defrauding Virginia legislator, autism group\n\n\u2018Banana Kush\u2019 and \u2018Peanut Butter\u2019: Police, marshals bust suspected marijuana, vaping operation in Foggy Bottom\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Henry K.
