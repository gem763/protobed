For long periods of this valuable win at Goodison Park, it seemed as if the reigning Premier League champions could fail to win for the third time in eight league games, handing a significant advantage to the contenders and pace-setters across Stanley Park.\n\nGabriel Jesus\u2019 opener was cancelled out by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. But Pep Guardiola\u2019s remain composed and eventually profited through the excellent Riyad Mahrez and the otherwise-wasteful Raheem Sterling. Jordan Pickford\u2019s role in both goals will be questioned. The result continues Everton\u2019s disappointing run of form, but City will only care that the gap at the top remains five points.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

A heavy defeat would only have increased the pressure on Marco Silva after last weekend\u2019s defeat to Sheffield United.\n\nHe was not even the master of his own technical area at times, with Guardiola once needing to apologise for straying into his counterpart\u2019s space. This was a much-improved performance from the one which preceded it, and Everton had opportunities to make sure they earned a positive result, but a fourth defeat in five games does little to help Silva's cause.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It was his eighth of the season. The record, Thierry Henry\u2019s 20 in 02-03, already seems in sight. And just like Tottenham and Watford before them, Everton could not stop De Bruyne finding a pocket of space and sweeping the ball to the far post.\n\nIt is, in a way, predictable. De Bruyne is constantly looking to take up this specific position, sure that his supreme crossing ability can overcome even the most organised defence. You know what is coming next, but can do next to nothing about it.\n\nFernandinho fumbles in defence\n\nThere was considerable concern about City\u2019s defence after the defeat at Norwich, and even more when John Stones joined Aymeric Laporte in the treatment room. Fernandinho then stepped in at Shakhtar Donetsk and two clean sheets followed. Suddenly, calm was restored.\n\nYet Everton\u2019s equaliser was a reminder that he is a holding midfielder playing in an unfamiliar position. His botched clearance, straight into Alex Iwobi\u2019s feet, could have proved to be a costly moment\u2019s hesitation. Meanwhile, City\u2019s midfield failed to press the ball without him at the base. He is filling a gap, but perhaps not the cure-all to City\u2019s injury issues.\n\nCalvert-Lewin makes most of what he has\n\nSilva\u2019s Everton are an odd team: playing with a target man but surrounding him with tricky, intricate technicians. The idea, it would seem, is that Dominic Calvert-Lewin knocks the ball down to feed those around him. And even though he is not well catered for, he is increasingly carrying a goal threat of his own.\n\nCalvert-Lewin has to take anything he can get in a team not set up to make the most of his attributes, hence why he so eagerly stole Everton\u2019s equaliser from Seamus Coleman. It was the first time he has scored in consecutive Premier League games, but also his fourth goal in three starts. And he should perhaps have had another, when denied by Ederson shortly after Mahrez\u2019s winner.", "description": "City remain\u00a0composed for important three points Even for a side with the quality of Manchester City, three points do not always come easy.
