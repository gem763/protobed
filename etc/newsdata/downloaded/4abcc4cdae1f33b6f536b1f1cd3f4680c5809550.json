But the sequence is also athletic and commanding: showcasing a confident performer in total control of her body, how she looks and drawing the exact reactions she wants \u2014 from the bawdy whoops of money-tossing men to the awe of a young colleague (played by Crazy Rich Asians star Constance Wu).\n\nWith her third feature, Scafaria shines a light into the world of strip clubs \u2014 where the dancers who serve as the main attraction often get taken advantage of \u2014 and how a band of ambitious, complicated women turn the tables on the system in an attempt to gain control over their own lives and livelihoods.\n\nThe glitzy, female-focused crime thriller is loosely based on a 2015 New York Magazine article about a group of former strip club workers-turned-high-stakes grifters who concoct an illicit scheme to drug wealthy Wall Street clients and empty their wallets.\n\nTelling a story from a little-heard perspective was one of the things that excited Scafaria, who said that few onscreen depictions of strippers showcase their humanity or explore their lives with empathy.\n\n\"I like taking characters who maybe feel misunderstood and trying to see if people can understand them a little more,\" she said in Toronto on Friday, a day before Hustlers made its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\"I felt a real responsibility to show their point of view in there and what they go through in life.\"\n\nThough Scafaria was enlisted as the screenwriter to adapt Hustlers from Jessica Pressler's New York magazine piece, someone else was initially sought to helm it: director Martin Scorsese. Through development hiccups \u2014 after original studio Annapurna Pictures exited, STX Films acquired the project \u2014 the Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed director passed and Scafaria and her producers successfully convinced the financial backers she was the right person to direct the movie.\n\nFemale-led onscreen and off\n\nA key part of Scafaria's vision was to put a diverse range of women onscreen to reflect women from all walks of life. She mixes \"megawatt stars\" like Lopez and Wu with top recording artists like Cardi B and Lizzo as well as performers she'd met and been inspired by, like actress Trace Lysette, opera-singing pole dancer Marcy Richardson and Canadian comedian, writer and stripper Jacqueline Frances, aka Jacq The Stripper.\n\nJulia Stiles, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Mercedes Ruehl and Madeline Brewer round out the main cast.\n\nCardi B and Constance Wu were part of a female-led cast and creative team. (STXfilms/Elevation Pictures)\n\nHustlers was female-led off-screen as well: along with Scafaria's writing and direction, the movie was edited and largely produced by women (including Lopez).\n\nWorking alongside so many women on Hustlers \"was a joy,\" according to Wu. But the rising star \u2014 known as much for her role on TV's Fresh Off the Boat as for her activism when it comes to representation \u2014 is eager for more.\n\n\"We're having this one moment where we have this table that's run by women [in this] story that's about and by and for women and that's great. We can't just have one,\" she noted in Toronto.\n\n\"I would like for it not to be extraordinary that we have an all-female team. I would like that to be just normal, you know? Nobody blinks an eye when you have an all-male team. No one's like 'Oh why did you do that?''\n\nFollowing its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, Hustlers opens in theatres Friday.", "description": "While the strip club setting is a familiar one in Hollywood, Hustlers offers a fresh\u00a0take seen through an all-female lens, thanks to writer-director Lorene Scafaria and its diverse cast of women.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5273113.1567780724!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/hustlers.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
