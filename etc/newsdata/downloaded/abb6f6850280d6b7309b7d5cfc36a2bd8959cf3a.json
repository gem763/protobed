He has done so with the explicit blessing of President Trump, who considers the former vice president and 2020 candidate a top nemesis headed into a presidential election year.\n\n\u201cSeeking to enlist a foreign actor to interfere with an American election undermines our sovereignty, democracy, and the Constitution, which the President is sworn to preserve, protect, and defend,\u201d Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote to Pompeo.\n\n\u201cThe President and his personal attorney now appear to be openly engaging in precisely this type of abuse of power involving the Ukrainian government ahead of the 2020 election.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast first reported in June that Democrats on Capitol Hill were preparing an investigation into Giuliani that focused on whether the former mayor\u2019s efforts in Ukraine worked against U.S. foreign policy interests. Earlier this month, the congressional committees formally announced their probe and said they would also look at Trump\u2019s decision to temporarily withhold security assistance to Kiev.\n\nThat military assistance as well as Trump and Giuliani\u2019s conversations with Ukraine about Biden are a part of an official whistleblower complaint filed with the director of national intelligence. Although the complaint is not public and is being withheld from Congress, it\u2019s emerged that Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenske to investigate Biden for his son\u2019s business activities in the country.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday. Giuiliani has openly acknowledged he tried to convince Ukraine to look into the Bidens.\n\nEngel demanded Pompeo respond by Thursday as to whether the State Department will cooperate with the congressional investigation.\n\nAsked Monday if he\u2019d agree to an interview with Congress, Giuliani tersely replied to The Daily Beast: \u201cNo, not [with] the corrupt ones like Schiff and Nadler.\u201d He also cited attorney-client privilege between him and President Trump.\n\n\u201cIf they want to come after me, I gladly accept it, because we could just make the Biden stuff bigger news,\u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast in June. \u201cDo it! Give me a chance to give a couple speeches about it and hold a press conference. I\u2019d love that\u2026I think it\u2019d be a fun fight. I\u2019ll just compare it to all the things they\u2019re not investigating\u2026If they want, we can have a big fight over this.\u201d", "description": "Three congressional committees demanded the Trump Administration start turning over documents this week\u2014or else.", "authors": ["Erin Banco", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "National Security Reporter", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569269344/190923-Banco-Rudy-tease_li30zb", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
