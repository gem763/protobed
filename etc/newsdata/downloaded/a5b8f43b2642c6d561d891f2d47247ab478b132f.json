Now it\u2019s called consumer packaged goods (CPG), but that doesn\u2019t mean anything has slowed down. In fact, the opposite is true. Things are moving faster than ever.\n\nTo operate successfully in such a fast-moving environment, a business needs to be agile, with the ability to adapt quickly as trends develop. But it also helps if you can see the future first. At Libstar, strategy is about seeing the future first. Seeing where the market is headed. Seeing the opportunities, the gaps. Seeing where there\u2019s space for innovation. Strategy drives the future of our business, and two subsets of that strategy are the habit of innovation and the art of joining the dots.\n\nTrust your gut\n\n\n\nLancewood has a special place in the Libstar family. And in the story of Lancewood, innovation has always been a key ingredient.\n\nIn 2008, Lancewood was a bankrupt dairy. The banks had literally put padlocks on their doors. Libstar took on the Lancewood business and now, 11 years later, Lancewood is the most profitable natural cheesemaker in South Africa.\n\nEveryone told us to stay out of the yoghurt category. Apparently it was too competitive for a newcomer to make an impact. But when I was travelling in Portugal, I noticed how amazingly good their yoghurt was; much better than what was on offer in South Africa. I wondered why. Why couldn\u2019t we in South Africa do a yoghurt that was better than anything they have overseas?\n\nALSO SEE... Carrot cake cookies with cream cheese icing\n\nIt took us a year, but it\u2019s fair to say that Lancewood now has the best double-cream flavoured yoghurt in South Africa \u2013 it won one of only six Qualite awards handed out at the 2019 Dairy Association Annual Fair \u2013and sugar-free and low-fat-high-protein versions will be launching soon.\n\nAnother example of how to connect the dots is Lancewood Sauce Delight \u2013 we took fresh cream, which all the dairies have on shelf, and added real cheese, mushrooms or peppercorns to produce three brand new flavoured white sauces. A few months ago, that product sector did not exist. Now we\u2019re producing about 30 tons of Lancewood Sauce Delight every month.\n\nMulti-Cup \u2013 the small food packaging company that Libstar owns \u2013 has also seen the future first, in this case by moving away from manufacturing plastic cutlery, cups and lids and towards producing wooden cutlery, paper straws and compostable cups.\n\nEnvironmentally sustainable packaging has been on Multi-Cup\u2019s radar for years. Initially we imported biodegradable cups and straws, but that turned out to be far too expensive. So now we are the first to manufacture eco-friendly packaging solutions in South Africa, supplying customers like KFC and our new Precious Planet brand. It\u2019s a market opportunity that we\u2019ve grown from zero to a R3-million turnover per month.\n\n\n\nYou get a culture of innovation, which is great, but then you get innovation in your DNA. If, like Libstar, you have the latter, then growing profitability in a hands-on, more efficient and more innovative way will come naturally.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s building a machine to inject nitrogen into peanut butter to make it easier to spread; a new forex management system that secures better exchange rates on imports and exports; working with retail partners to drive innovation in product categories \u2013 we do all this and more. Because of our entrepreneurial background, innovation at Libstar never sleeps.\n\nThe many faces of innovation\n\n\n\nA successful strategy doesn\u2019t have to be fancy. Daniel Jacobs, our CEO at Ambassador Foods, looks for gaps in the market and then he finds a way to fill them by any means necessary. Ambassador currently packs 54 tons of product for Woolworths per week \u2013 all of which is based on expanding simple nut production into categories like cereals, snack bars, confectionary, groceries, and health and wellness. Achieving that kind of product diversity (147 lines in total) is rooted in continual innovation.\n\nAmaro Foods, which bakes exclusively for Woolworths, is another great example of how connecting the dots can be a key skill and how technology can play an important role.\n\n\n\nTony Amaro, the CEO of Amaro Foods, prides himself on developing scratch recipes \u2013 which means using no pre-mixes, only pure raw ingredients. Tony spent eight years perfecting the current Woolworths hot-cross bun recipe and, in fact, everything baked by Amaro Foods is from-scratch recipes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmaro Foods will also become the first Libstar company to run a totally paper-free production facility when their new artisanal bakery opens in December. The point of going paperless is not only that it\u2019s green, more efficient and will drastically improve data management \u2013 it\u2019s also another way of seeing the future first.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s one final thing that\u2019s central to connecting the dots of successful business collaborations and relationships, and it\u2019s rooted in something my mother used to say. \u201cMy son,\u201d she\u2019d say, \u201cYou\u2019ve only got one name. If you throw that one name away, you don\u2019t have another name. You\u2019ve been given onename.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s important to realise that in the trade you only have one name. Yes, Libstar works hard at innovating, but integrity and absolute honesty and openness are at the heart of everything we do.\n\nWithout these core values, I believe that it would be difficult to stay in business long enough to see much of the future anyway.\n\nFollow Lancewood on Instagram | Facebook | Twitter\n\nALSO SEE...
