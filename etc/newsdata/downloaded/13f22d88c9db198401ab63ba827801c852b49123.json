They both take place across \u2018hallways\u2019 between apartments, they both have a local hang out place \u2013 a coffee shop versus a comic book store \u2013 and could Penny and Leonard be any more Rachel and Ross?\n\nIs that Kaley and Courteney\u2026 or Penny and Monica? (Instagram: @courteneycoxofficial)\n\nBut although both series saw an array of guest stars on their shows, we never got to see any of the cast of Friends appear on The Big Bang Theory, despite Kaley previously saying she\u2019d have loved Jennifer Aniston to appear on the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I love her so much, she\u2019s also my style icon,\u2019 Kaley enthused to AOL Entertainment earlier this year.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m obsessed with her, because she\u2019s always so effortless and cool.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to say that it looks like she doesn\u2019t try, because she obviously tries, but she just looks like the coolest chick around.\u2019\n\nWe\u2019ve still got our fingers crossed for some sort of anniversary reunion crossover in the years to come\u2026\n\nGot a showbiz story?
