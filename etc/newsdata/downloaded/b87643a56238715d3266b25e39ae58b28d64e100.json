There\u2019s also a significant amount of butt litter which ends up in our waterways.'\n\nThe no-smoking zones will also act as a strong deterrent to stop quitters from relapsing by limiting the locations where they can legally smoke.\n\nLocations inside the no-smoking zone include both Elizabeth and Hobart Bus Mall, Salamanca Square and Trafalgar Place.\n\nFines can also be issued for smokers in a vehicle with a child inside, within three metres of a bus stop, between the flags at the beach, or within 20 metres of an outdoor sporting event.\n\nMore than 500 Tasmanians die from smoking-related deaths every year.", "description": "Hobart City Council have hired a full-time anti-smoking police officer to roam the city with the power to fine smokers starting on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/15/19697502-0-image-a-34_1571064435410.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
