(Examples of Smith's early, prescient reporting for RCI can be found here, here, here, and here.)\n\nNow Smith reports the ways Whistlegate -- in which Trump supposedly pressured Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in return for military aid -- actually looks like Russiagate by other means.\n\nKey points:\n\nIn both cases, Trump is alleged to have taken or solicited dirt on his Democratic opponent from a foreign power in exchange for favors to that country's government.\n\nIt was understandable, Smith writes, that once Trump was cleared by the Mueller Report, the President would urge Ukraine's new leader to investigate Trump-Russia's origins -- because Ukraine always figured in that disproven narrative in major ways.\n\nFusion GPS, the Democrat-hired opposition research firm behind the spurious Steele dossier, also circulated two previously undisclosed dossiers on Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and Ukraine.\n\nDemocrats asked Ukraine's leaders to help dig up dirt on Trump and his associates in 2016 and then publicly denounce him.\n\nWhen Democrats discovered shady dealings in Ukraine by Manafort, they advanced a narrative that made Trump guilty by association.\n\nWithout evidence, they argued that because one of Manafort's clients, Ukraine's former President Viktor Yanukovych, was supposedly close to Putin, Trump was also in Putin's pocket.\n\nThis narrative ignored Manafort's urging Yanukovych to forge close ties with the European Union instead of Russia.\n\nIt also ignored the fact that the Ukrainian energy company that paid Joe Biden's son up to $50,000 a month was run by one of Yanukovych's allies.\n\nThough many have forgotten it now (and anti-Trump media are loathe to bring it up), the questionable Trump-Manafort-Ukraine argument was advanced through media leaks as a keystone to the Trump-Russia collusion narrative by intelligence officials and Clinton operatives. So the current Ukraine furor looks like old wine in new bottles, Smith concludes.\n\nBut why the repackaging? Smith answers: \"Anti-Trump forces in the government and media are working to vindicate their previous efforts and discredit a forthcoming Justice Department inquiry into the origins of Russiagate by again connecting Trump and a foreign power to a U.S. election.\"\n\nRead Full Article\n\nHere Are the Giuliani-Ukraine Notes Few Have Seen\n\nRealClearInvestigations\n\nNotes of Rudolph Giuliani's interviews with two former Ukrainian prosecutors include one\u2019s allegation that then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko warned him against investigating energy firm Burisma Holdings \u201cas it was not in the interest of Joe and/or Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nEric Felten reports for RealClearInvestigations:\n\nThe notes were published by a Ukrainian news site , and their authenticity was confirmed by Giuliani.\n\nThe notes have turned over to congressional committees, but have not been publicly released in the United States.\n\nThey are likely to figure in Trump impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe Ukrainian prosecutor was later fired, under what President Trump says was pressure from Vice President Biden, whose son Hunter had a lucrative role on the Burisma board.\n\nThe Trump Investigations: Top Articles\n\nWhite House Declares War on Impeachment Inquiry, New York Times\n\n4 Intel Aides Alarmed at Pressure on Ukraine, Washington Post\n\nClaim: 2nd Whistleblower on Trump-Ukraine, New York Times\n\nWhistleblower Tie to Unidentified Dem in Presidential Race, Examiner\n\nCampaign Finance Charges vs. 2 Giuliani Ukraine Associates, New York Times\n\nTrump Sought Tillerson's Help for Client of Giuliani, Bloomberg\n\nTrump Adviser: China Provided Info About Hunter Biden, Financial Times\n\nWhat Hunter Biden Did Was Legal.

New York Times\n\nDurham Probe of Trump Campaign Surveillance Expands, Fox\n\nIntel Inspector's Stonewall on Backdated Whistleblower Rules, Federalist\n\nLying FBI Press Aide Got Sports Tickets From CNN and NYT, Daily Caller\n\nOther Noteworthy Articles and Series\n\nFarrow Book: Alleged Matt Lauer NBC Anal Rape\n\nVariety\n\nA former NBC employee claims that Matt Lauer raped her while they were covering the Sochi Olympics in 2014; she also says that back in New York she had several more sexual encounters with him. \u201cIt was completely transactional,\u201d the woman, Brooke Nevils, told reporter Ronan Farrow, who relays her story in his new book on the #MeToo movement. \u201cIt was not a relationship.\u201d Lauer admits the affair, but claims it was consensual. The Daily Beast reports that the report plunged NBC News into trumoil. The New Yorker ran three excerpts from Farrow\u2019s book, \u201cCatch and Kill: Lies, Spies and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators,\u201d including this one which details Harvey Weinstein\u2019s use of Israeli private-intelligence agency Black Cube to surveil his accusers and the journalists trying to tell their stories.\n\nAlabama: Jails Free Sick Inmates to Avoid Hospital Bills\n\nAL.com/ProPublica\n\nAcross Alabama, inmates suffering heart attacks, on the verge of diabetic comas, and brutalized in jail beatings have been released so sheriffs wouldn\u2019t have to pay for their medical care. Some were rearrested once they had recovered. Several Alabama sheriffs, including Washington County Sheriff Richard Stringer, said in interviews that they often find ways to release inmates with sudden health problems to avoid responsibility for their medical costs.\n\nWest Virginia: Suspicious Insulin Injections, Deaths at VA Hospital\n\nWashington Post\n\nAbout a dozen deaths at the Louis A. Johnson VA Medical Center in West Virginia reflect a frightful pattern: Elderly patients in private rooms were injected in their abdomen and limbs with insulin the hospital had not ordered \u2014 some with multiple shots. The insulin, which was quickly absorbed, was given late at night when the hospital staff had emptied out. Within hours, the veterans\u2019 blood-sugar levels plummeted. The deaths from the second half of 2017 through July 2018, initially found to be of natural causes, are now being investigated as homicides.\n\nTop Secret Russian Unit Seeks to Destabilize Europe\n\nNew York Times\n\nAn elite unit inside the Russian intelligence system skilled in subversion, sabotage, and assassination has been executing a coordinated campaign to destabilize Europe. The poisoning of an arms dealer in Bulgaria; a thwarted coup in Montenegro; and the use of a nerve agent in an attempt to assassinate a former Russian spy living in Britain last year are among the activities alleged to be carried out by the group, known as Unit 29155. The purpose of Unit 29155 underscores the degree to which the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin is actively fighting the West with his brand of so-called hybrid warfare \u2013 a blend of propaganda, hacking attacks and disinformation \u2013 as well as open military confrontation.\n\nWhy Is the U.S. Still Using Hypnosis to Convict Criminals?\n\nGuardian\n\nIn recent decades, the scientific validity of several forensic practices that prosecutors once relied on to secure convictions has been undermined \u2013 including the analysis of blood-spatter patterns and the study of what distinguishes arson from accidental fires. This article focuses on another suspect practice, hypnosis, which has been used as a forensic tool by U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies since the World War II. Proponents argue that it allows victims and witnesses to recall traumatic events with greater clarity by detaching them from emotions that muddy the memory. Yet multiple studies have established that hypnosis often harms subjects\u2019 recall.\n\nThe Ugly Side Of GoFundMe: Is It a 'White Savior' Platform?\n\nAtlantic\n\nA wealthy young man dealing with emotional loss met a black teenager named Chauncy who didn\u2019t have enough to eat. He bought him some food. That made him feel good. So he soon started a Go Fund Me page for the boy \u2013 hoping to raise $250 so the kid could buy a lawnmower to start a landscaping business. Ultimately, he raised $342,106, enough to purchase a house. According to this article, that\u2019s a problem. \u201cGoFundMe campaigns that go viral tend to follow a template similar to Chauncy\u2019s Chance: A relatively well-off person stumbles upon a downtrodden but deserving \u2018other\u2019 and shares his or her story; good-hearted strangers are moved to donate a few dollars, and thus, in the relentlessly optimistic language of GoFundMe, \u2018transform a life.\u2019\" The article adds: \"GoFundMe campaigns blend the well-intentioned with the cringeworthy, and not infrequently bring to mind the \u2018White Savior Industrial Complex\u2019 \u2013 the writer Teju Cole\u2019s phrase for the way sentimental stories of uplift can hide underlying structural problems. \u2018The White Savior Industrial Complex is not about justice,\u2019 Cole wrote in 2012. \u2018It is about having a big emotional experience that validates privilege.\u2019 \u201d", "description": "RealClearInvestigations' Picks of the Week Oct. 6 to Oct. 12, 2019 \nFeatured Investigations It's Not All About the Bidens: Why Trump Has Ukraine on the Brain\nThe Trump-Ukraine whistleblower...", "authors": ["October"], "top_image": "https://www.realclearpolitics.com/asset/img/rcinv-home-logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
