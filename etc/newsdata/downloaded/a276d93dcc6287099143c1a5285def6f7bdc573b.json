Susan Collins, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner and Michigan Senate hopeful John James. All are establishment-aligned figures confronting tough races in swing states. Behind the scenes, Romney\u2019s team has also begun directing his donors to help GOP candidates in Senate battlegrounds.\n\nRomney aides say he\u2019s always intended to help in competitive Senate races and that his desire to do so has never been influenced by Trump\u2019s efforts to ostracize him. Yet the senator\u2019s recent efforts underscore his insistence on not receding from a Republican Party now dominated by Trump. At 72 and in the twilight of his political career, Romney cares little about what the president has to say about him, his friends say, and is determined to take a stand for mainstream Republicans who\u2019ve been increasingly marginalized since Trump took office.\n\n\u201cI know plenty of my candidates would love Romney\u2019s fundraising help \u2014 he\u2019s got a huge donor network, regardless of the Twitter sentiment of the day,\u201d said Will Ritter, a top aide on Romney\u2019s 2018 Senate campaign, referring to Trump\u2019s attacks.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
