If those talks also end in failure, the prospect of yet another general election -- which the Times of Israel has labeled a \"nightmare third election scenario\" -- could become a reality.\n\nWarning of that possibility on Thursday, Rivlin said he \"will do everything I can to prevent another general election.\"\n\n\"But the responsibility for this, as well as the responsibility for forming a government that serves all the citizens of Israel with the dedication it deserves, is yours,\" he said, addressing the country's political leaders.\n\n\"Our current situation, which has gone on for a long time, with a transition government, grievously limits the ability of the government to act and to serve the citizens of Israel, and our ability to face the political, security and economic challenges we face,\" warned Rivlin.\n\nNetanyahu has moved quickly since the elections.\n\nFirst, he announced that he had united the ultra-Orthodox religious and right-wing nationalist parties behind him, giving him a bigger, declared, bloc in Parliament, albeit one that is six seats short of a minority.\n\nHe followed that up with an appeal to Gantz to join him in a unity government, though that was widely seen as more of an attempt to put pressure on Gantz, rather than a genuine offer.\n\nIsraeli press asks where it went wrong for Netanyahu\n\nThe battle to form a government comes in the face of ongoing corruption investigations against Prime Minister Netanyahu; he faces possible charges of bribery and breach of trust, pending a final pre-indictment hearing in front of the Attorney General scheduled for the first week of October.\n\nHe denies the allegations against him but Blue and White says it will not sit in a government with Netanyahu as long as the longtime leader remains under criminal suspicion.\n\nA longtime member of Netanyahu's Likud Party told CNN on Thursday that, in his opinion, the Prime Minister's \"motivating force\" is not forming a unity government, but rather avoiding those corruption charges.\n\n\"The real story, the other story, which is the most important story for Bibi, is his attempt to stop the criminal investigation against him by using parliamentary immunity,\" former deputy prime minister Dan Meridor told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"He needed a majority in parliament to give him immunity so that the charges against him -- which are quite heavy, of [bribery], of corruption -- will not be pursued.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu in the run-up to this week's poll.\n\nNetanyahu could also face the possibility of fighting a third general election after being indicted on those charges -- providing added urgency to this attempt to forge a path to power.\n\n\"While he may then seek to portray himself still more desperately as the victim of a political witch hunt, that gambit manifestly did not play to his advantage on Tuesday,\" the Times of Israel wrote on Friday.\n\nIsraeli media has elsewhere reflected on the combination of obstacles facing the longtime ruler.\n\n\"Pride made Israel's longest-serving prime minister misjudge the mainstream electorate's size, priorities and feelings, which under his sleepy radar traveled steadily from respect through doubt to wrath,\" wrote the Jerusalem Post, in a piece asking \"Where did Bibi go wrong?\"\n\nAnother piece in Haaretz noted the Prime Minister's hardened rhetoric during the most recent election season, and concluded that \"Netanyahu lashed out like Erdogan, but may fade out like Nixon.\"", "description": "Benny Gantz has opened up a two-seat lead over Benjamin Netanyahu in the \"almost final\" results of Israel's razor-tight election, as both men prepare for a fight to command a parliamentary majority and form a government.", "authors": ["Andrew Carey", "Rob Picheta", "Amir Tal"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190919154614-benjamin-netanyahu-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
