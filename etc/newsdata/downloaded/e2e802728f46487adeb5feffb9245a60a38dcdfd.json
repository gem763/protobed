Everything has to be perfect.\u201d\n\nHer agent Jos Hermens added: \u201cWe have an eye on two, three, four American coaches, but it must be someone with whom she must click.\u201d\n\nHermens had advised Hassan to move to Portland after the Rio Olympics and train with Salazar. His four-year ban for doping violations was announced at the world athletics championships in Doha where Hassan completed an unprecedented double in the 1 1,500 and 10,000m.\n\nThe U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said Salazar was punished for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d as head coach of the Nike Oregon Project, a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes. Hassan said after the ban that her career had been thrown into uncertainty but insisted she was clean.", "description": "Double world champion Sifan Hassan plans to continue to train in Portland despite the closure of the controversial Nike Oregon Project and the four-year doping ban handed to her former coach Alberto Salazar.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445554721&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0NE-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
