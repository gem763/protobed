The latest was on Oct. 4 when a gay rights activist was bludgeoned to death.\n\nEarlier this week 16 LGBT+ activists were detained and charged for having gay sex after police raided their charity office and residence, forcing them to undergo anal examinations.\n\nLast weekend a gay Rwandan refugee was beaten outside his office in Kampala and a lesbian woman physically assaulted by her doctor, say activists.\n\nPolice said they had not registered any cases of assaults specifically targeting sexual minorities.\n\nUganda\u2019s minister of health said on Friday that she was aware of some of the attacks on the LGBT+ community and appealed to health care providers not to discriminate against them.\n\nLGBT+ activists welcomed the statements, but said more action was needed to ensure sexual minorities could live free from fear.\n\n\u201cWe would also urge the government to enact legislation against hate crimes and publicly condemn hate speech such as what is being said by some politicians which fuels homophobia,\u201d said Frank Mugisha, head of Sexual Minorities Uganda.\n\nCharges against the 16 activists were a \u201csham\u201d and should be dropped, he added.\n\nUganda\u2019s Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo said on Oct. 10 that the government planned to re-introduce an anti-homosexuality bill in parliament within weeks to curb the spread of homosexuality.\n\nLokodo\u2019s statement was widely reported and international donors to Uganda said they were monitoring the situation closely and stood by the rights of LGBT+ people.\n\nA spokesperson for President Museveni later denied the plan, saying Uganda\u2019s current penal law - which provides for up to life imprisonment for gay sex - was sufficient.", "description": "NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Uganda has sought to reassure sexual minorities that they are safe, saying it has no plans to introduce the death penalty for gay sex after reports of rising homophobic attacks.", "authors": ["Nita Bhalla", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445151063&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P06Z-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
