Still, he acknowledged the declining revenue from legacy print platforms, and the dominance of Facebook and Google in the digital ad sphere, continue to create challenges.\n\n\u201cThe headwinds are still there,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cNo one is suggesting that we are not dealing with a very disrupted, contracting environment.\u201d\n\nDigital revenue grew to $31.2 million for the quarter and $125.1 million for the year, representing 21.4 per cent and 20.2 per cent of total revenue.\n\n\u201cWe expect these digital revenue trends to continue into fiscal 2020 and we continue to believe digital revenue represents a future growth opportunity for Postmedia and as a result we are focused on various new products and initiatives in this area,\u201d the company said in its management discussion and analysis of its results.\n\nFor the quarter, print advertising revenue was $57.5 million and print circulation revenue stood at $51.1 million. That represented declines from the same period last year of 16.5 per cent and 5.3 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to know if that will continue, or if the legacy platforms will find a bottom,\u201d MacLeod said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an accurate understanding of where this is going.\u201d\n\nThe company posted net earnings for the quarter of $7.9 million, compared to a $22.9 million loss in the same quarter last year.\n\nIt also realized a 9.4 per cent reduction in operating costs in the quarter, or about $14.5 million.\n\n\n\nThe company said it retired $130.2 million of first-lien debt between October 2016 and August 2019. As a result of a refinancing in September, it now has $95.2 million in first lien notes not due until 2023, and US$120.7 million in second-lien notes that mature in 2024.\n\nMacLeod said the company, like other media organizations, has been deeply affected about Google and Facebook, which he said dominate the market for digital ads. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it was heartening to see regulators and governments beginning to wake up to the potential threat that such market control poses to democracies. In the meantime, he said Postmedia is focused on figuring out ways to be symbiotic with the two tech giants.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: gfriedman@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GabeFriedz", "description": "Results demonstrate the company is making progress as it capitalizes on digital revenue opportunities, CEO Andrew MacLeod said", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/andrew-macleod-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
