They claimed Tada was violating a domestic law that only allows licensed operators to offer paid transportation services and another that bans rented vehicles from doing so.From very early on, Tada has rebutted such claims citing another clause in the transportation law that specifically allows rented vans with 11 to 15 seats to be offered with drivers.Launched in October 2018, Tada wasn\u2019t the first ride-hailing service that met strong opposition from the local taxi industry. Kakao, one of Korea\u2019s largest IT companies, also attempted to launch a carpool service last year but succumbed to the taxi industry\u2019s opposition and discontinued its app. Recently, Kakao shifted its direction to acquire licensed taxi companies instead of competing against them.Despite being a small start-up, Tada has been staunch about its legality and was successful. Tada grew in popularity among the public for its clean rides and quiet drivers. The number of users increased to an average of more than 10,000 per month, and the number of vans being operated reached 1,400.BY SONG KYOUNG-SON [song.kyoungson@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
