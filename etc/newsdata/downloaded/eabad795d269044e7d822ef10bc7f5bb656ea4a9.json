The vats of hot oil are precarious, balanced over stoves on the pavement, or in retrofitted shopping carts filled with charcoal, held in place by wads of crushed aluminum foil tucked under the wheels. The setup may appear rudimentary, but the frying that happens in this space is an art.\n\nIt\u2019s most evident at the stalls selling pollo y papas fritas , where cooks brown large quantities of chicken and thickly cut fries, but work in small batches so what you order is still crisp, almost too hot to touch. If you say yes to everything on top, that means swirls of spicy ketchup, mayonnaise and a mild green salsa, which quickly amalgamate into a far more messy and powerful super sauce.\n\nFor the day laborers who head to the market at the end of their shifts, these renditions of pollo y papas fritas, served outside among the city\u2019s Guatemalan\u2019s community, aren\u2019t just filling, satisfyingly crunchy and well seasoned. They\u2019re also more affordable than the fried chicken at Pollo Campero, a Guatemalan chicken chain down the street.\n\nAnd they\u2019re sold alongside a range of regional specialties from back home that can be harder to find, like paches, the potato tamales stained red with mild chiles, and pepi\u00e1n, the stew practically creamy with finely ground pumpkin seeds.", "description": "Catering to the largest Guatemalan community outside of the country, a market serves regional specialties and turns frying into an art.", "authors": ["Tejal Rao"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/dining/29Guatemalan1/merlin_163059564_d09da7a6-c0a1-477b-89af-16a6c0490825-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
