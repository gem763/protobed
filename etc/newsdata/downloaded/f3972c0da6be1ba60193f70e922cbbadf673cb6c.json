Trump decided to call off the meetings after the Taliban took responsibility fo ran attack in Kabul last week that killed an 12 people, one of which was an American soldier. Taliban leaders, however, say that Americans' lives are now in danger because of Trump's decision, Reuters reported.\n\n\u201cThis will lead to more losses to the U.S.,\u201d Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement. \u201cIts credibility will be affected, its anti-peace stance will be exposed to the world, losses to lives and assets will increase.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is putting peace talks on hold and will not reduce troops in Afghanistan, like previously expected, until the Taliban can hold up their end of the bargain.\n\nAmerican diplomats and Taliban leaders have been in talks for months. President Trump has wanted to end the United States' involvement in Afghanistan, something he campaigned on during the 2016 election. Trump was committed to withdrawing thousands of troops in exchange for the Taliban's security guarantees.\n\nFighting has erupted in Afghanistan, which has made Ghani critical of any peace deals. On Tuesday, nine former United States ambassadors warned that a \"total civil war\u201d could erupt in Afghanistan if President Trump withdraws troops before Taliban leaders and the Afghan government fail to reach a peace agreement.\n\nPompeo, however, said the United States wouldn't withdraw troops because of a \"timeline.\"\n\n\u201cPresident Trump made clear we\u2019re not just going to withdraw because there\u2019s a timeline. We\u2019re only going to reduce our forces when certain conditions are met,\u201d Pompeo said on CNN.", "description": "Wow..09/08/2019 19:26:07PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/231/601f5672-34e3-404b-bc37-80cbdc3fcc4b.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
