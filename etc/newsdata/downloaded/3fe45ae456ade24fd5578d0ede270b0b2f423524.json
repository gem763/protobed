I hated it, I couldn't wait to retire.\"\n\nAlongside the video Shearer added the caption: \"Yes Michael, we thought that also, whilst on \u00a3120k a week...\"\n\nBut Owen immediately hit back at his former England captain, questioning Shearer's commitment to his boyhood club.\n\n\"Not sure you are as loyal to Newcastle as you make out mate,\" Owen said. \"I distinctly remember you being inches away from signing for Liverpool after Sir Bobby Robson put you on the bench. You tried everything to get out.\"", "description": "Former Liverpool and Man Utd striker says he spends mornings in Dubai swimming with the kids - then props up the bar", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Daily Mirror", "Offside"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662846.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michael-Owen-June-2005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
