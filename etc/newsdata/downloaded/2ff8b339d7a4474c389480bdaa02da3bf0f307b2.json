Photo: Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nApparently football is back on, and if this has caused you to repeatedly wonder, what is Gisele up to? as much as I have, then not to worry, an answer has emerged. WWD reports that the model, author, and environmentalist is the new face of Dior Capture Totale, the anti-aging skin-care line that focuses on revealing skin that radiates beauty.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much of a reason to ask Why Gisele? if you\u2019ve ever seen her, but in case you haven\u2019t, please direct your eyes to the photo of Gisele at the top of your screen and then back here to the words of Claude Martinez, president and chief executive officer of Parfums Christian Dior. Martinez tells WWD B\u00fcndchen was chosen because she is \u201cthe perfect embodiment of healthy beauty,\u201d and because she is \u201cthe icon of wellness, generated by a unique idea of healthy and purely authentic beauty.\u201d\n\nB\u00fcndchen will appear in the new print and digital campaigns for the line, but those won\u2019t drop until 2020.
