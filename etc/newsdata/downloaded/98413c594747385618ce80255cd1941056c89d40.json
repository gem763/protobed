It\u2019s something that\u2019s very real. I do think anti-Asian racial epithets are not taken as seriously as slurs against other groups.\u201d\n\nBut, echoing a series of Tweets, the tech entrepreneur added: \u201cAt the same time, bigger picture: I believe that our country has become excessively punitive and vindictive about remarks that people find offensive or racist.\n\n\u201cWe need to try to move beyond that, if we can, particularly in a case where the person \u2026 [is] like a comedian whose words should be taken in a slightly different light.\u201d\n\nGillis was announced as a new member of the SNL cast this week, alongside Bowen Yang \u2013 a writer for the show who is now its first Asian cast member \u2013 and Chloe Fineman.\n\nShortly after that, a freelance journalist uncovered footage of Gillis making racist and homophobic statements, including offensive remarks about Asian people, culture and food, on Matt and Shane\u2019s Secret Podcast. A deluge of similar footage followed.\n\nI believe our country has become excessively punitive and vindictive about remarks that people find offensive or racist Andrew Yang\n\nGillis\u2019s comments about Yang were first reported by Vice. Discussing the Democratic presidential race on Luis J Gomez\u2019s Real Ass Podcast, Gillis, 31, is heard initially referring to Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cThat Jew chink?\u201d Gillis says. \u201cCommie Jew chink? Next, please, next. Gimme your next candidate, Dems. Jew chink, next. Actually, they are running a Jew chink: Chang, dude.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cYang, or Chang?\u201d\n\nBy Sunday lunchtime, NBC and Saturday Night Live had not commented.\n\nGillis issued a statement on Thursday, saying he was \u201ca comedian who pushes boundaries\u201d.\n\n\u201cI sometimes miss,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you\u2019re going to find a lot of bad misses. I\u2019m happy to apologize to anyone who\u2019s actually offended by anything I\u2019ve said. My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Yang tweeted: \u201cFor the record, I do not think he should lose his job. We would benefit from being more forgiving rather than punitive. We are all human.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, CNN host Jake Tapper also asked Yang about criticism that some of his own comments about being Asian American reinforce harmful stereotypes. During the debate in Houston this week, for example, the tech entrepreneur remarked: \u201cI am Asian, so, I know a lot of doctors.\u201d\n\nOn CNN, he said: \u201cThe Asian American community is very diverse and certainly, I would never claim that my individual experience would speak to the depth and breadth of our community. At the same time, I think Americans are very smart, and they can actually see right through that kind of myth.\n\n\u201cIf anything, by poking fun at it, I\u2019m making Americans reflect a little bit more on them.\u201d", "description": "Presidential candidate says anti-Asian racism \u2018very real\u2019 but US has become \u2018excessively punitive about remarks people find offensive\u2019", "authors": ["Victoria Bekiempis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11b8d32653b790a65bae9db62edb0a0044e41182/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f396383be8b40d185d37f9ffb4d23122", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
