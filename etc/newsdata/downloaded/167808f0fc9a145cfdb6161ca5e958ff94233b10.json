Several shots were fired and one person was slightly injured, but the suspect was held down by others in the mosque. The suspect has also been linked to the death of his stepsister.\n\nThe attack is believed to have been inspired by similar incidents this year in New Zealand and the US. In Christchurch, 51 people were killed in a mass shooting at two mosques on 15 March, while in El Paso, Texas, a gunman left at least 22 dead on 3 August.\n\nThe PST agency said \u201cmeeting places for Muslims and non-western immigrants\u201d, political parties or persons, Jews and LGBT communities were \u201csymbolic targets\u201d.\n\nThe service updated its assessment hours after it said a Norwegian citizen in his 20s had been arrested for \u201cterrorist association\u201d on Thursday afternoon. It was not known whether that case was linked to the heightened assessment.\n\nAfter last month\u2019s failed attack, the PST said it had received a \u201cvague\u201d tip a year ago about Manshaus but it was not able to act because nothing concrete was revealed. The agency\u2019s boss, Hans Sverre Sjoevold, said at the time there was no reason to change the overall threat assessment for Norway.", "description": "Heightened assessment based on extremists expressing backing for recent attacks", "authors": ["Ap In Copenhagen"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b61aeb5c9d1374ee5109278aa4acb0dd855bc98/0_68_3380_2028/master/3380.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=65a0396b754fa688ffd1908f62b4edc6", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
