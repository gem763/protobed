If McConnell maintains the same pace for the full eight years, Trump will have appointed far and away the most federal judges of any president in American history.\n\nThis was by no means a foregone conclusion. Recall that there were dozens of \u201cNever Trump\u201d voices in 2016 claiming that President Trump would nominate liberals and relatives to the courts. Instead, he has nominated one impeccable originalist after another.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the president has stood firmly behind his nominees when they\u2019ve come under attack from the left. McConnell has done an admirable job, as has Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. But without resolve at the White House, the whole enterprise would have fallen apart long ago.\n\nIf the left\u2019s savage attacks on Justice Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 which they now admit were politically-motivated \u2014 were not enough to shake President Trump\u2019s resolve, then nothing is. Top-tier lawyers and jurists such as Kavanaugh can more confidently seek and accept nominations knowing that \u2014 come hell or high water \u2014 the leader of the free world has their back.\n\nThe President\u2019s support isn\u2019t just an empty gesture, either. Nothing incenses the left quite so much as a federal judiciary committed to interpreting the Constitution the way it was originally intended. George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation, for instance, is pouring millions of dollars into a dedicated opposition research and activist group specifically aimed at stopping, ruining, and humiliating qualified Trump judicial nominees.\n\nThe group, \u201cDemand Justice,\u201d has put Democratic politicians such as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on stage with radicals such as Ferguson Riot organizer Brittany Packnett. This group is firmly committed to keeping the courts in the hands of people who will disregard the Constitution and ensure that women aren\u2019t unduly inconvenienced when they wish to get a late-term abortion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor conservatives, though, the money Soros and his fellow leftists spend fighting Trump\u2019s judicial nominees is a win in and of itself. If the Kavanaugh affair proved anything, it\u2019s that they\u2019re throwing their money down a well \u2014 and every dollar they waste is a dollar they can\u2019t spend on their other ludicrous priorities, such as confiscating guns from law-abiding citizens.\n\nThe courts are rapidly being returned to the originalists, and each new confirmation represents another brick in the wall that will protect American liberties from liberal overreach long after President Trump leaves the White House. The howls of outrage emanating from the political left are a good indication of just how successful the president has been.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JENNA ELLIS", "description": "The howls of outrage emanating from the political left are a good indication of just how successful President Trump has been.", "authors": ["Jenna Ellis", "Jenna Ellis Is A Member Of The Trump Advisory Board.
