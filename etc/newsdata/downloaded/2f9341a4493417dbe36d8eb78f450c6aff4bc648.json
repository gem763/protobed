He offered him money for a hotel or food. \u201cHe told me that he couldn\u2019t accept the money for religious reasons,\u201d Styles said. \u201cHe said he was vegan.\u201d\n\nThe morning after he first encountered Tarazaga-Orero, Styles gave him vegan food. \u201cHe asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant and eat with him,\u201d Styles said. \u201cI told him I was on my way to work so I couldn\u2019t. I found it a little odd.\n\n\u201cHis facial expression made me feel a little uneasy; it was a kind of smirk. I realised there was something not quite normal.\u201d\n\nStyles said that Tarazaga-Orero began showing up at Styles\u2019s local pub up to four times a week, entering the establishment \u201canywhere between a minute and two minutes after I arrived\u201d. It was at this point that Styles started to feel he was being followed.\n\nHarry Styles: Lights Up review \u2013 soulful, enigmatic return Read more\n\nStyles was at home when Tarazaga-Orero posted almost \u00a350 in cash through his letterbox. The man later posted two notes listing his bank details through the door, asking for the money Styles had offered him on their first meeting. He also stopped the singer while he was running in Regent\u2019s Park and asked him for money.\n\nThe encounters made Styles feel \u201cunsafe and uneasy\u201d in his home, leading him to employ a night guard, lock his bedroom door at night and assess \u201cweak spots\u201d in his residence. \u201cIf I see people on multiple occasions, I view them differently than I would before,\u201d he told the court. He reported Tarazaga-Orero to the police in June 2015.\n\nTarazaga-Orero told the court that Styles \u201cwas trying to buy me with money\u201d and that he had \u201ca vision\u201d that the pair would be together in Ireland.\n\nHe said Styles had offered the cash so they could go to a hotel to \u201chave some fun\u201d. Styles denied the allegation.\n\nTarazaga-Orero said that he never intended to stalk Styles. \u201cIn the end I just wanted the money he offered me. I don\u2019t have any feelings for him. I\u2019m not in love with him.\u201d\n\nDistrict Judge Nigel Dean said that Tarazaga-Orero was neither a credible nor a reliable witness. \u201cMr Styles felt sorry for a young man he saw to be living without a home in winter.\n\n\u201cI find the suggestion that Mr Styles suggested he would accompany the defendant to a hotel for fun to be completely incredible. He was trying to help another for whom he felt sorry.\u201d\n\nTarazaga-Orero will be sentenced on 21 October.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Court told Pablo Tarazaga-Orero camped outside star\u2019s home, visited his local pub and had \u2018a vision\u2019 they would be together", "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2676025029dbd53e7a8b9bc22ad99b1abecdceb/974_0_2184_1311/master/2184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1c4a6076e5bc8def364199558080341", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
