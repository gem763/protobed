The picture was published by Time magazine on Wednesday.\n\nLiberals need to hang onto Toronto, Canada\u2019s largest city, to have any chance of retaining power. The city has faced a recent escalation in gun violence, which is why Trudeau made his gun ban announcement there.\n\n\u201cThoughts and prayers aren\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d Trudeau told a news conference. \u201cWe know you do not need a military-grade assault weapon, one designed to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time, to take down a deer.\u201d\n\nThis month, a 17-year-old was killed by gunfire and five other people were wounded in a community just outside of Toronto. Two days later another person was killed in a shooting on a major highway.\n\nAt least four members of Trudeau\u2019s Cabinet turned up at the announcement to show their support, including Finance Minister Bill Morneau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland who stood among some two dozen legislators and candidates. Trudeau shook hands or hugged every Liberal on the stage at the end of the event.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Friday, Freeland said the ban of military assault rifles was \u201ca really important step\u201d and that she was \u201creally glad to serve in a government that is campaigning on that as part of our platform, and I\u2019m proud to be on the PM\u2019s team.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tremendous confidence in Justin Trudeau as the leader, as the prime minister,\u201d said Freeland, who is a key ally of Trudeau\u2019s and one of his most visible ministers - comments showing that the prime minister\u2019s team is squarely behind him.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during an election campaign stop in Toronto, Ontario, Canada September 20, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Osorio\n\nSELFIES AND HECKLES\n\nEarlier in the day, Trudeau walked down the street in Toronto\u2019s Danforth district, where the sitting Liberal member of Parliament faces a tough fight. Most of the people he met seemed delighted to meet him, including a young woman who embraced him four times and posed for a selfie.\n\nStay-at-home father Stu Simmons said the blackface photo was not important as long as Trudeau did his job.\n\n\u201cI dressed up as The Hulk when I was 18 and no one\u2019s going to get mad at me about that, except perhaps the Martians,\u201d he told Reuters.\n\nNot everyone was welcoming. \u201cWhere\u2019s your black face, man?\u201d one woman shouted at Trudeau. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he replied.\n\nLiberals said that while the scandal is politically damaging, voters will ultimately be more interested in concrete measures such as the new gun rules.\n\nThose announced on Friday include a buyback program for all legally purchased assault rifles, and a Liberal government that would also work with other levels of government to give municipalities the ability to further restrict or ban handguns.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nBefore the blackface images emerged two days ago, polls showed Trudeau running head-to-head with his main rival, Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nWhen asked about gun control before Trudeau\u2019s announcement, Scheer said he does not believe \u201cblanket bans\u201d are effective and that boosting police resources \u201cto go after criminal and illegal firearms\u201d works better.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s campaign was upended when Time magazine on Wednesday published the image at the 2001 \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party. Other images have since emerged, and Trudeau said on Thursday he was \u201cwary\u201d of ruling out the existence of even more because he could not remember those that had already come to light.\n\nOn Friday, Trudeau said a video that emerged on Thursday showing him with his arms, face and even parts of his legs blackened came from a costume day when he worked as a whitewater rafting guide on the Red River in Quebec, when he was in his early 20s.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, embroiled in a blackface picture scandal, on Friday pledged to ban military-style assault rifles in the country's most ethnically diverse city in a bid to get his campaign back on issue.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432064586&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1SU", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
