(Photo: Facundo Arrizabalaga/Pool via REUTERS)\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s just-announced legal action against Associated Newspapers \u2014 which the royal has accused of launching a \u201cruthless campaign\u201d to vilify his wife \u2014 will be hashed out by lawyers, but the couple already appears to be winning in the court of public opinion.\n\nThe couple, currently on a royal tour of Africa, have been flooded with messages of support since Prince Harry issued a statement announcing legal proceedings against the parent company of the British tabloid, Daily Mail, on Sunday over its publication last February of a private, handwritten letter from the duchess to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. The couple\u2019s lawyers have claimed the paper violated their privacy and copyright in an effort to \u201cpublish false and deliberately derogatory stories\u201d about Meghan.\n\nPrince Harry also rose to his wife\u2019s defense and blasted the \u201crelentless propaganda\u201d surrounding her media coverage, writing, \u201cMy wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences \u2014 a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.\u201d\n\nHe went on to express his fear of \u201chistory repeating itself\u201d thanks to media intrusion, citing his late mother, Princess Diana.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Jameela Jamil were among those hailing the new parents for taking action. Prince Harry\u2019s statement as a protective husband has also received significant praise.\n\nI\u2019m proud to call Meghan and Harry friends, and I\u2019m even more proud of them for finally saying enough is enough. https://t.co/HWy4FQ0oLr \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) October 1, 2019\n\nPrince Harry wishing a mf\u2019er WOULD mess with Duchess Meghan again. pic.twitter.com/lKfZE3YtyH \u2014 April (@ReignOfApril) October 1, 2019\n\nMeghan and Harry said ENOUGH \ud83d\udde3 pic.twitter.com/5xMfaCgxjc \u2014 Phoebe Parke (@PhoebeParke) October 1, 2019\n\nHARRY AND ALEXIS OHANIAN ARE MY FAV \u201cTHAT\u2019S MY WIFE\u201d WIFE GUYS https://t.co/5WkrXYbcxw \u2014 Nicole Cliffe (@Nicole_Cliffe) October 1, 2019\n\nThis statement, from Prince Harry, is absolutely extraordinary. He's suing the Daily Mail. More power to him and his wife. https://t.co/4an8sru6IH \u2014 Caitlin Moran (@caitlinmoran) October 1, 2019\n\nWow. Prince Harry is so fed up with how Princess Megan has been treated by British media, they\u2019re SUING.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m really happy Megan has such a supportive partner, and that he is doing the right thing by fighting back. British media is so evil to Megan, i hope she\u2019s okay. https://t.co/d5dk07Fmtz \u2014 Global Esthetician (@LaBeautyologist) October 1, 2019\n\nPrince harry is really suing the daily mail for slander against his wife \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe I have to Stan \u2014 YoruBaddie \ud83c\uddf3\ud83c\uddec (@demiwithenny) October 1, 2019\n\nNot everyone is impressed, however. British talk show host Piers Morgan took to Twitter to call the couple\u2019s statement \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201csavage,\u201d while one of his followers blasted them as \u201ca pair of weak narcissists.\u201d Other commenters accused Prince Harry of \u201cusing the Diana card\u201d and claimed he and Meghan should become private citizens if they objected to the pitfalls of royal life.\n\nI've never read a more savage attack on the press than this one by Harry/Meghan.\n\nNor a more disingenuous one.\n\nThey've had the praise & criticism their behaviour has warranted.\n\nThey talk of bullying but this is their attempt to bully the press into fawning sycophancy. \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 1, 2019\n\nKate had to suffer years of harrasment and criticism and never once whined to William or blamed the UK or the public.
