The couple revealed their most personal thoughts in an hour-long documentary that was filmed throughout their 10-day tour of Africa last month and aired in the U.K. this evening. (It will premiere in the States later this week.)\n\nHarry & Meghan: An Africa Journey was presented by Tom Bradby, a British news anchor who has known Harry for the best part of 20 years and whom the couple clearly felt comfortable speaking with.\n\nHe interviewed both Harry and Meghan several times as they traveled with son Archie through South Africa and Harry separately visited Botswana, Angola, and Malawi. While the tone of some of the earlier interviews was upbeat, by the end of the tour, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex had both spoken emotionally about their struggles, and Bradby admitted his documentary was \u201cnot always the one we expected.\u201d\n\nIn a particularly frank interview in Angola, where Harry traveled to highlight Princess Diana\u2019s work on landmines, Bradby asked the prince about whether he worried about his wife being under the same pressure his mother was. Harry replied, \u201cI think you\u2019ve probably slightly hit the nail on the head.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will always protect my family and now I have a family to protect,\" Harry said.\n\n\u201cSo everything that she [Diana] went through and what happened to her is incredibly raw every single day. And that\u2019s got me being paranoid, that\u2019s just me not wanting a repeat of the past.\u201d\n\nView photos Photo credit: Getty Images More\n\nBradby also asked Harry about his mental health, a topic that the prince has been open about previously. \u201cI thought I was out of the woods and then suddenly it all came back. And I suddenly realized actually, no, this is something that I have to manage,\" he said.\n\n\u201cPart of this job, part of any job like everybody, means putting on a brave face and turning a cheek to a lot of this stuff. But again, for me and for my wife of course there\u2019s a lot of stuff that hurts, especially when the majority of it\u2019s untrue.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.\u201d\n\nAs the tour came to a close, it was revealed that Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing parts of a letter to her father. A few days later, it was announced that Harry has filed claims against two tabloid newspaper groups for the alleged interception of voicemail messages. To many, especially at the end of a successful tour, it felt like the announcements came out of the blue. However, the documentary made it clear that anger over what they see as unfair treatment by sections of the media has been simmering for a long time.\n\nWhen asked about what the last year has been like, Meghan told Bradby about the intense media scrutiny she has faced. \u201cI had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand here. But when I first met my now husband, my friends were really happy because I was so happy. But my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great. But you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life,'\" she said.\n\nMeghan added that she \"very naively\" wondered what they were talking about. \"So, it's been complicated,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked it she could continue with things in the same way, Meghan replied, \u201cI have said for a long time to H\u2014that\u2019s what I call him\u2014It\u2019s not enough to just survive something, right? That\u2019s not the point of life. You\u2019ve got to thrive, you\u2019ve got to feel happy. I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip. I really tried.\"", "description": "The Duke and Duchess of Sussex give their most candid interviews yet in the new documentary Harry & Meghan: An Africa Journey.", "authors": ["Victoria Murphy"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oLbClVwioOon.1ZeTDeSkA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/d0b1779eb3f4282ab6c3be0ba44091c6", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
