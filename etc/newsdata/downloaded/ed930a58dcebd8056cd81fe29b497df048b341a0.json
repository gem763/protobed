And that probably takes more easing.\n\nThe 2018 rate-hiking cycle tightened financial conditions and triggered a stock market selloff that resulted in the worst year for the S&P 500 since said financial crisis. And even with the Fed reversing course this year, economist Joe LaVorgna at Natixis highlighted in a note to clients this week that 2019's easing cycle still hasn't worked off the Fed's 2018 mistakes.\n\nIn his note, LaVorgna highlighted that the spread between the current two-year Treasury yield and the targeted Federal Funds rate is currently negative. In LaVorgna's view, this inversion is telling the Fed that more than 25 more basis points of easing are needed right now, adding that, \"from a risk management perspective, the Fed should maintain maximum optionality \u2014 leaving the door open to further interest rate cuts.\"\n\n\"After all,\" Lavorgna added, \u201cif the economy surprises to the upside over the next few months, interest rates will rise accordingly. Then, the Fed can stand pat.\u201d\n\nThe negative spread between 2-year Treasury yields and the Fed Funds rate is suggesting that financial conditions are still too tight, indicating the Fed will need more than one more rate cut before its current rate-cutting cycle is over. (Source: FRED, Natixis) More\n\nLast week on The Final Round, we spoke with Merrill Lynch strategist Matt Diczok who reminded viewers that there are basically two ways to get a recession \u2014 either a negative shock to supply or demand, or the Fed tightens too much and the economy turns south.\n\nThe Fed right now is working to prevent the latter.\n\nThis past week, economic data suggested that the decelerating economy is not getting worse. But as we noted, questions about the labor market \u2014 and in turn, the U.S. consumer \u2014 are still outstanding.\n\nRob Martin and the economics team at UBS estimate that Friday's jobs report will show just 60,000 new jobs were created this month, with the General Motors (GM) strike impacting that headline number by 49,000. Combining this data with an expected GDP print showing the economy grew at an annualized rate of just 1.6%, concerns about the state of the economy aren't likely to recede.\n\n\u201cIt is too early for the Committee to communicate a neutral stance for policy at the October meeting,\u201d said economists at Deutsche Bank in a note to clients this week. \u201cWith risks remaining skewed to the downside, incoming data continuing to soften, and leading indicators signaling a further slowdown in the coming quarters, the Committee will find it hard to send a clearly hawkish signal at the October meeting.\u201d\n\nSo while trade headlines can still be a market mover \u2014 as we saw on Friday \u2014 the market's message to the Fed remains one that calls for easier monetary policy.\n\n\u201cMid-cycle adjustment\u201d has become the defining phrase of the Powell Fed in 2019. And it's not yet clear that we'll enter the new decade having retired this guiding principle for the current Fed regime.\n\nBy Myles Udland, reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.
