The Houthis went on to take the capital Sanaa, forcing Mr Hadi into exile abroad.\n\nThe conflict escalated dramatically in March 2015, when Saudi Arabia and eight other mostly Sunni Arab states - backed by the US, UK, and France - began air strikes against the Houthis, with the declared aim of restoring Mr Hadi's government.\n\nThe Saudi-led coalition feared that continued success of the Houthis would give their rival regional power and Shia-majority state, Iran, a foothold in Yemen, Saudi Arabia's southern neighbour. Saudi Arabia says Iran is backing the Houthis with weapons and logistical support - a charge Iran denies.\n\nBoth sides have since been beset by infighting. The Houthis broke with Saleh and he was killed by Houthi fighters in December 2017. On the anti-Houthi side, militias include separatists seeking independence for south Yemen and factions who oppose the idea.\n\nThe stalemate has produced an unrelenting humanitarian crisis, with at least 8.4 million people at risk of starvation and 22.2 million people - 75% of the population - in need of humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of five.\n\nYemen's health system has all but collapsed, while the world's largest cholera outbreak has killed thousands.\n\nIn June 2018, Saudi-backed government forces began an assault on the key rebel-held port of Hudaydah, the entry point for the vast majority of aid going into Yemen and a lifeline for the starving. Aid agencies warned the offensive could make Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe much worse.", "description": "Get to grips with the basics of Yemen's three-year civil war with our short explainer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10A22/production/_102003186_mediaitem102003185.jpg", "published_at": "2018-06-13"}
