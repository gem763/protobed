End of list,' Michael Che, co-anchor of 'Weekend Update,' said. 'When we talk about honesty, we talk about not being afraid to tell people the truth about how we feel. Because that's the connect that comedians can have with people and nobody does it better than you - ever.'\n\nAnd Chappelle acknowledged his reputation as he accepted the award, cigarette in mouth and obscenities flying.\n\n'Hold on right here because I know they're going to edit some of this s*** out,' he said during his speech. The show, taped Sunday night, will air on PBS in January.\n\nHe then tossed down his cigarette, went up to the Mark Twain Award sitting on a stand on the stage, stood next to it, gave a big smile and said directly to the camera in a serious monotone: 'It's an honor, thank you.'\n\nThe audience gave him a standing ovation.\n\nChappelle, 46, was toasted by a host of friends, including his writing partner Neal Brennan, Common, Bradley Cooper, Tiffany Haddish, John Legend, Lorne Michaels, Mos Def, Michael Che, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, Morgan Freeman, Colin Jost, Kenan Thompson and Stewart.\n\nThe night was filled with laughter and applause as the comedians ribbed Chappelle about his quirky career decisions while praising him as an honest voice in the comedy world.\n\nChappelle used his time on stage to sing the praises of comedy as a profession and share his love for making people laugh.\n\n'Stand up comedy is an incredibly American job. I don't think any other country could produce this many comedians. And unbeknownst to anyone in this audience, I don't think there's a opinion that exists in this country that is not represented in a comedy club by somebody. Each, everyone of you has a champion in the room,' he said.\n\n'I love this job. It saved my life,' he said. 'There is something so true about this job, when done correctly.'\n\nIn a time when the media has been criticized and free speech has been under attack, Chappelle pointed out the importance of the first amendment.\n\n'First Amendment is first for reason. Second Amendment is just in case the first one doesn't work out,' he pointed out. 'Look at me smoking indoors. I didn't ask anybody. I just did it. What are they going to do? Kick me out before I get the prize? I don't think so. It's call leverage.'\n\n'We got let some air out,' he added. 'The country's getting a little tight. It doesn't feel like it's ever felt in my lifetime.'\n\nDave Chappelle with his family at the Kennedy Center - his mother Yvonne is at the far left and his wife Elaine is seated to Chappelle's right\n\nLorne Michaels recalled how he only wanted Chappelle to host the 'Saturday Night Live' that aired right after the 2016 election\n\nBradley Cooper brought his daughter to the show and praised Chappelle for making him a better man\n\nAnd he paid tribute to his mother Yvonne, who was in the audience.\n\n'You have no idea what I put this woman through,' he said of his mom.\n\nHe recalled that, as a teenager, she would drive him to comedy clubs and sit there until late in the night so he would have a chance to practice his monologues.\n\n'How many of you here have ever heard your mother say: \"P**** jokes were a little too much tonight son,\"' he said as the audience roared in laughter.\n\nPolitics made a small, cameo appearance during the night as various comedians took the stage.\n\n'I see the love and the joy and the laughter in this room, I can't help but wonder is this what s*** was like down there when Obama was president. Laughter and joy? Now you all just walk around like go f*** yourself,' Jon Stewart said after he walked out on stage.\n\nChappelle, known for his sharp observations of race and society made with a biting wit, has mocked topics ranging from President Donald Trump to the #MeToo in his humor.\n\nPresident Trump was not at the ceremony. He and first lady Melania Trump were watching the Washington Nationals play the Houston Astros in Game Five of the World Series as Chappelle was roasted.\n\nChappelle is a local. He was born in Washington D.C., attended the city\u2019s prestigious Duke Ellington School of the Arts, and filmed his first HBO special in the nation\u2019s capital at the Warner Theater.\n\nHe shot to fame with satirical comedy sketch series 'The Chappelle's Show' but shocked Hollywood when he walked away from a lucrative $50 million deal to extend the program.

You guys aren\u2019t as full of surprised as you used to be. I think I speak for all of Black America when I say we are praying for Omarosa,\u2019 Chappelle said. \u2018But America has actually done it \u2013 we\u2019ve elected an internet troll as our president.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m gonna let the whites figure this out among themselves,\u2019 he added.\n\nAnd he pledged to give Trump a chance.\n\n\u2018I'm wishing Donald Trump luck, and I'm going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too,\u2019 he concluded.\n\nFor that monologue, Chappelle received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nBut he later expressed regret for what he said, saying he \u2018f*** up\u2019 for giving Trump a chance.\n\nMichaels said Sunday night he had no idea what Chappelle was going to say in his monologue.\n\n'I had no idea what he was going to do. I like to think he did,' Michaels dead panned and then went on to praise Chappelle for his 'brilliant' take on the 2016 results.\n\nActor Aziz Ansari joked about how Chappelle talked him into trying psychedelic mushrooms\n\nThe rapper Common talked about Chappelle's love of music\n\nJohn Legend paid tribute to Chappelle's work to help the people of Dayton, Ohio, after a mass shooting there earlier this year\n\nBradley Cooper, who worked with Chappelle in 'A Star is Born,' said he was glad he met the comedian before his daughter - who was there with him at the show - was born as he 'made me a better man.'\n\nAnd he also mentioned Chappelle's famous 'Saturday Night Live' monologue, referencing a part where Chappelle talked about a party he had been to at the White House when Obama was president and he had looked out upon a sea of black faces - and Bradley Cooper.\n\n'I'm still mad about SNL,' Cooper said. 'In the monologue, you did say you know you were at the White House, and you saw a sea of faces and there was one white guy and you were like, oh Bradley Cooper's here. We went together motherf*****. What are you talking about?'\n\nChappelle grew up in Yellow Springs, Ohio, just outside of Dayton, and he hosted a free benefit concert for the city in August after a mass shooting resulted in nine deaths and multiple injuries.\n\nStewart recalled how Chappelle called him and asked him to participate.\n\n'I watched him help a city, heal a wound and replace it not just with love and with compassion but as we sat and watched Stevie Wonder sang and had the crowd growing crazy and reclaiming their city, he turned to me on stage and said 'this is their memory now.\n\nJohn Legend, also from Ohio, recalled how Chappelle brought 'comfort after tragedy.'\n\nChappelle has gained a reputation for his willingness to sacrifice financial gain or order to remain artistically independent.\n\nMorgan Freeman narrated the program\n\nDave Chappelle paid tribute to his love of comedy when he accepted the award\n\nDave Chappelle with his wife Elaine, arriving at the ceremony\n\nHe\u2019s also been criticized for defending fellow comedy Louis CK, who was accused of sexual harassment, mocking transgender people, and taking shots at the #MeToo movement.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t mind that people get upset,\u2019 he told PBS in July of last year. \u2018I learn about a lot of things, you know, just from my critics.\u2019\n\nHe explained his comedic philosophy in one of his stand-up appearances last year.\n\n\u2018I say a lot of mean things. And I don\u2019t say them because they\u2019re mean, I say them because they\u2019re funny. And everything\u2019s funny until it happens to you,\u2019 he said.\n\nChappelle has won two Emmy Awards and two Grammy Awards for his work and now has another for his shelf.\n\nThe Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize recognizes those who have had an impact on American society in the vein of 19th-century writer Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym Mark Twain.\n\nPrevious recipients of the include Tina Fey (2010), Will Ferrell (2011), Ellen DeGeneres (2012), Carol Burnett (2013), Jay Leno (2014), Eddie Murphy (2015), Bill Murray (2016), David Letterman (2017), and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (2018).\n\nTaped Sunday night at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., the tribute to Chappelle will air nation-wide on PBS on January 7, 2020.", "description": "Dave Chappelle was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor Sunday night and Jon Stewart led a profanity-laced tribute to the politically-incorrect comedian.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/03/20266054-0-image-a-2_1572234737530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
