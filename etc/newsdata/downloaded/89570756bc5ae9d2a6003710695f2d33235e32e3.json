I like to get it in,\" Butler said (via Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel). \"How did I get in today? I clocked in at 3:30. You're asleep, right?\"\n\nButler joined the Heat this summer on a four-year, $141 million contract.\n\nButler has apparently inspired other Heat players, as Miami big man Meyers Leonard tweeted that he and center Bam Adebayo both got up early to work out, not wanting to be out-worked by Butler.\n\nAccording to Winderman, Butler was also working out at American Airlines Arena at 4 a.m. during the offseason. The time stamp on a Butler tweet from September 24 seems to confirm he is an early riser.\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra described Butler as having a \"Hall of Fame work ethic.\"\n\n\"The thing that also is notable about that is he has a Hall of Fame work ethic,\" Spoelstra said. \"That's not something of myth. That's something that's well earned and it's real. I think he also respects that he's walking into a gym where there's several guys that are right there with him, step for step, in terms of work ethic.\n\n\"They may not be coming in at crazy hours like he comes in, but they're putting in time and putting in a lot of extra time.\"\n\nButler's schedule may not come as a surprise, considering he is close friends with Mark Wahlberg. The actor has a famous routine that includes waking up at 2:30 a.m., praying, eating breakfast, then working out from 3:40 a.m. to 5:15 a.m.\n\nButler said that while he enjoys the training, he's ready for the season to begin.\n\n\"I just want to compete,\" Butler said. \"I just want to hoop. All the training is cool. But I want to get out there with my guys, talk a little bit. But more than anything, just compete.\"", "description": "Jimmy Butler showed off his \"Hall of Fame work ethic\" by showing up to Heat training camp practice nearly seven hours before it started.", "authors": ["Scott Davis"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d97537f9386bc0c352d252d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
