Bird lovers, however, have already contributed enough to last through the year.\n\n\u201cPeople are still sending money so there is hope we can keep the eagle sim cards running until they come back from their faraway journeys in early summer to Russia, where mobile connectivity is not so expensive,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSteppe eagles breed in southern Russia and Kazakhstan, and spend their winter in Africa and India.\n\nThey have experienced rapid decline due to the spread of farming land across their territory and are vulnerable to wind turbines, according to Bird Life International.", "description": "Moscow (AFP) \u2013 Russian scientists tracking migrating eagles were forced to start a crowdfunding campaign after their birds wandered into Iran and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/f67c4d_steppe-eagles-face-rapid-decline-due-spread-farming-land-territory-are-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
