I am therefore asking you to categorically and publicly assure the civil service that no civil servant will be asked to breach their obligation under the civil service code to \u2018comply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u2019,\u201d he wrote.\n\nSenior civil servants told the union they were concerned that if they assisted the government in defying the will of parliament as set out in legislation, they could be in breach of the law and therefore their code of conduct.\n\nAccording to the civil service\u2019s code of conduct, civil servants \u201cmust comply with the law and uphold the administration of justice\u201d.\n\nThe union, which represents the UK\u2019s most senior government officials, sought advice from a leading employment lawyer after receiving queries from dozens of members across several Brexit departments who were worried about their legal position.\n\nSenior civil servants could face disciplinary action or even criminal charges in some circumstances if they complied with a government instruction to break the law, the lawyer warned. They could face a disciplinary panel or criminal charges such as malfeasance in a public office, the advice said.\n\nThe European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act, drawn up by a cross-party group of MPs against a no-deal outcome and given royal assent this week, mandates the prime minister to seek a further extension to Brexit beyond the current date of 31 October to 31 January next year \u2013 unless Johnson has either secured a deal with the EU that is acceptable to parliament, or MPs have voted for no deal before 19 October.\n\nDowning Street has maintained that Johnson would neither resign, nor comply with the law to delay Brexit and has refused to explain how the apparent contradiction could be reconciled.\n\nReacting to the union\u2019s letter, Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general who helped to draw up the rebel bill, said senior civil servants are deeply concerned by Downing Street\u2019s threat of ignoring the law.\n\n\u201cI could well understand that civil servants are getting increasingly worried by the extraordinary words, statements and behaviour coming from No 10 Downing Street.\n\n\u201cOur constitution depends upon people observing rules of honesty and integrity and we seem to be losing them very quickly at present,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal advice obtained by Labour from Matrix Chambers warned that if Johnson defies the law, the civil service will be placed in an \u201cinvidious position in so far as they may be asked to take steps that are either contrary to the law or seek improperly to circumvent the law\u201d.\n\nLord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said: \u201cIt is quite extraordinary that there is even a question of putting civil servants in a position where they could break the civil service code and that ministers are seriously contemplating breaking the law.\n\n\u201cThis development confirms the very serious place we have now reached.\u201d\n\nThe most senior official in each government department could seek a formal instruction called a ministerial direction if asked to commit an illegal act, the Labour peer said.\n\n\u201cPermanent secretaries, in their role as accounting officers, have a duty to seek a ministerial direction if their minister wishes to proceed with spending that they regard as illegal or poor value for money,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere must surely be the prospect of such spending being incurred if a minister acts in a way that they know to be unlawful.\u201d\n\nShami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, said: \u201cThis is a scary moment for everyone, not least the law-abiding loyal public servants who are quite right to seek protection from a government out of control.\u201d\n\nAccording to a ComRes survey commissioned by the union, three-quarters (75%) of MPs recognise that attacks on the impartiality of the civil service have increased over the past three years, and agree that attacks on the civil service undermine public confidence and trust in the government (76%).\n\nDowning Street was approached for a response.", "description": "FDA head demands assurances over Brexit act if government defies parliament", "authors": ["Rajeev Syal"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d26756f3d4f8a6ba19709483a7c29f0241d4cbd9/0_30_4546_2727/master/4546.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bebbe0d40ce454219ecbf8cbb4e5a344", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
