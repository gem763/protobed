I had to live with my window boarded up for a while.\n\n'Dobbie is a small, defenceless pup who would not hurt anyone.'\n\nMitigating for Williams, Rebecca Carter said: 'The defendant pleaded guilty today to the offence of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal.\n\n'In respect to his personal circumstances, he is 30-years-old and currently in employment as a carpenter.\n\n'He has substantial mental health difficulties and suffers from borderline personality disorder, depression and anxiety. The probation service is prepared to work with him going forward.'\n\nWilliams will be sentenced on November 11 at 10am, following the completion of a pre-sentence report.\n\nSpeaking after the conclusion of the case, Miss Davies said: 'It absolutely broke my heart. I turned up in a taxi when I heard what had happened and I could see Dobbie with blood coming from his mouth. I could not hold or move him.\n\n'I could not believe someone would do that to an animal. I could not understand it. I didn't expect to see it at all.\n\n'He is a lovely family pet, I had rescued him from an abusive home. He has always been quite a nervous dog anyway.\n\nDobbie is still to undergo further leg surgery which will cost \u00a33,000, and a hip operation\n\nMiss Davies added that she'd had to rely on the help of others to fund the bills for Dobbie's care\n\n'The last month has been awful. It's been really hard. When it first happened I slept on the floor next to him for a week.'\n\nMiss Davies added that, as a single mother in receipt of benefits, she'd had to rely on the help of others to fund the bills to help Dobbie.\n\n'A family member donated \u00a31,000,' she said.\n\n'I have been doing little things like cupcake stalls with all the funds going towards Dobbie. We've also set up a fundraising page which is growing slowly.'", "description": "Daniel Ashleigh Williams, 30, broke into Jordanna Davies' home in Cilfrew, Neath in Wales and threw her pet Jack Russell-Chihuahua cross out of a window 30 feet and two storeys up.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20014556-0-image-a-29_1571704747825.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
