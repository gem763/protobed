Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $4.57 a share.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, earnings were $4.87 a share, above the $4.82 a share analysts had expected. Revenue rose to $26.67 billion from $23.25 million. Analysts expected $25.9 billion.\n\nThe Indianapolis company said it now expects net earnings to be more than $18.45 a share for 2019, and projected adjusted earnings at $19.40. The health insurer said it sees operating revenue to be about $103 billion, compared with its prior guidance of $102 billion.\n\nBut the company's medical-loss ratio, which represents the share of premiums paid out in claims, was 87.2% in the third quarter, higher than the 86.7% that a consensus of analysts had anticipated, according to their research notes. The figure was 84.8% in the prior year. Anthem also raised its full-year projection for the ratio.\n\nAnthem said that the MLR has been pushed up by its Medicaid business, an issue it also flagged last quarter. State crackdowns on verifying eligibility, which have been occurring in more than half of its Medicaid states, have changed the mix of enrollees, the company said. But the rates the insurer receives haven't always matched the new enrollment.\n\nSpeaking of the MLR guidance move, Anthem financial chief John Gallina said on a conference call with analysts that \"the entire increase is associated with Medicaid.\"\n\nAnthem said it expects Medicaid results to improve in 2020 as it renegotiates rates with states.\n\nAnthem also said the MLR rose compared with last year due to the suspension of an Affordable Care Act health-insurance tax, a dynamic that is affecting all insurers' results this year. The tax, a pass-through, had previously increased the revenue part of the ratio.\n\nWrite to Anna Wilde Mathews at anna.mathews@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 23, 2019 11:48 ET (15:48 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
