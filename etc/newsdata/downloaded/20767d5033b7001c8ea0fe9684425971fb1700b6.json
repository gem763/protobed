It is slightly smaller than Neptune. About 226 light-years away, it orbits the fainter member of a pair of cool M-type stars every 31.3 days. (Illustration by Francis Reddy/NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center)\n\nInterested in helping archivists uncover the secrets of enormous scientific collections? Looking to measure wild giraffes \u2014 or search for elusive gravitational waves?\n\nYou don\u2019t need a PhD or a lab coat to do so.\n\nYou don\u2019t even need to leave your couch or put down your phone.\n\nZooniverse, a citizen-science platform, uses crowd power to contribute to science.\n\nThe site recruits individuals to aid projects in fields such as physics, astronomy, zoology and the social sciences.\n\nIt\u2019s crowdsourcing on a huge scale. Individuals can scour through large data sets, collect and classify data and make scientific contributions that computers cannot. They can also connect with researchers in discussion forums, where their opinions and observations fuel further research.\n\nThe site has more than 1.7 million registered users who have so far classified over 439 million pieces of data. One popular project is Galaxy Zoo, where volunteers classify telescope images of far-off galaxies. Bash the Bug, another volunteer favorite, is helping researchers figure out which antibiotics can treat different strains of tuberculosis in an attempt to fight new drug-resistant strains.\n\nAll that work has resulted in plenty of published research. Exoplanet Explorers, a project devoted to finding new planets, has identified multiple planet candidates and an entire planet, K2-288Bb, located 226 light-years away.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2014, another project, the Cell Slider, looked much closer to home, and proved how crowdsourcing might be able to help in the fight against cancer. In that time, volunteers classified more than 180,000 microscopic images of human cells \u2014 and proved as accurate as trained pathologists at identifying cancerous cells and tumors.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get started: Just pick a project, complete a quick training and begin contributing on your computer or mobile phone.
