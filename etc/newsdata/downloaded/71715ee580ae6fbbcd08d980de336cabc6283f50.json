It would beat the record of 40 Gerd Mueller set in 1971/72.\n\n88 & 90 \u2013 the minutes in which Dortmund have conceded own-goals in two of their last three matches \u2013 all of which ended in 2-2 draws.\n\nFixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)\n\nFriday\n\nEintracht Frankfurt v Bayer Leverkusen (1830)\n\nSaturday\n\nRB Leipzig v VfL Wolfsburg, Werder Bremen v Hertha Berlin, Fortuna Duesseldorf v Mainz, Augsburg v Bayern Munich, Union Berlin v Freiburg, Borussia Dortmund v Borussia Moenchengladbach (1630)\n\nSunday\n\nCologne v Paderborn, Hoffenheim v Schalke 04 (1800)", "description": "Berlin (AFP) \u2013 Niko Kovac says Bayern Munich need to prove their shock defeat to Hoffenheim was only a Champions League hangover in their bid to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/aea5a3_niko-kovac-expects-bayern-munich-bounce-shock-home-defeat-hoffenheim-travel-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
