It\u2019s very, very well known. It\u2019s a beautiful piece. It was inspired by Picasso first,\u201d Kellett noted.\n\nA few weeks prior to the theft, a statue was taken from the gallery\u2019s second location at Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, according to KRON.\n\nKellett said she is saddened by the most recent incident because she wants the gallery to continue its open-door policy so everyone can enjoy the artwork.\n\n\u201cWe want everyone to feel welcome,\u201d she concluded.\n\nPolice have asked anyone with information regarding the etching\u2019s whereabouts to call the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) at 1-415-575-4444 or Text a Tip to TIP411 and begin the message with SFPD.", "description": "A suspect allegedly stole an etching by Spanish artist Salvador Dali worth $20,000 from a San Francisco, California, art gallery on Sunday.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/01/police-line-tape.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
