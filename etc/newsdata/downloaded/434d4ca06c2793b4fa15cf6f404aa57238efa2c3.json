No. I\u2019m talking Liam Hemsworth giving mouth-to-mouth to Maddison Brown\u2019s chest in the middle of a very public, paparazzi-filled street.\n\nYou can view all of the face-boob action here, but I warn you, it is some serious PDA. Enter at your own risk.\n\nLiam, what are you doing? I know he\u2019s been in Long-Term-Relationshipville for a decade, he might be a little rusty. But for the love of God, you can\u2019t just head-butt your girlfriend\u2019s chest.\n\nI know the whole \u201csleeping on your significant other\u2019s chest\u201d thing is romantic and cute, but I\u2019m not entirely sure it works when you\u2019re standing up in a public street.\n\nFellow Aussie Maddison Brown is an actress and model, most known for playing Kirby Anders on Dynasty. Despite both being from down under, Liam and Maddison both currently reside in the US.\n\nThe pair were spotted out for a few drinks at New York City\u2019s \u2018The Flower Shop\u2019 bar before their huge public affection display. They were later seen at Alley Cat amateur theatre, which leads me to believe they\u2019ve been on one, long, continuous date since Thursday.\n\nSome are calling Liam\u2019s PDA a revenge act against Miley, but honestly I think he\u2019s just enjoying a new fling. This is the first time he\u2019s been back on the market since 2009, when moustaches were on everything and he was basically an infant. Let the man enjoy his life, even if it\u2019s a little public.\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m living for this true-blue Aussie romance. Maybe they\u2019ll live happily ever after with Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky in Byron Bay. Isn\u2019t that what we all dream of?\n\nWhile Liam is getting cosy with Maddison Brown, Miley is also getting close to an Aussie with her new maybe-boyfriend Cody Simpson. Maybe Australians are all just a bunch of charming hotties?\n\nI thought I\u2019d be a little more upset that Liam and Miley have both moved on, but they both seem so incredibly happy. Can we all join in on a collective \u201cawwww\u201d?", "description": "Liam Hemsworth has recently been spotted on dates with fellow Aussie Maddison Brown, but it looks like they're taking the PDA to a new level.", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1132920679-1024x682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
