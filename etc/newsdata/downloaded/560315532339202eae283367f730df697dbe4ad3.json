(NVDA) is making an upside breakout now. Right now. We looked at NVDA just last week and concluded that, \"The charts of NVDA look fairly positive so traders should approach the stock from the long side.\"\n\nToday NVDA is moving up and over its key April highs so if you did not go long already, now is the time to pick up your mouse and get moving.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of NVDA, below, we can see that prices are up sharply today. The 50-day moving average line and the 200-day moving average line have positive slopes.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is moving above its September and April peaks for a bullish breakout and the clear message that buyers of NVDA are more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has turned up to a new outright go long signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of NVDA, below, we can imagine how the chart will look at Friday's close. NVDA will probably close strong and well above the April high. The 40-week moving average line will continue to rise.\n\nThe weekly OBV line will probably make a new high for the move up and best even the 2018 high. The MACD oscillator will move further above the zero line.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NVDA, below, we can see today's breakout and a projected price target of $243.\n\nBottom line strategy: Hold longs from last week and add to longs here and on any further strength. Risk a close below $185 for now. Target $243 or higher.", "description": "NVDA is moving up and over its key April highs....NVDA", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Nvidia Is Breaking Out On The Upside So It'S Time To Get Long Now", "Nvda Is Moving Up", "Over Its Key April Highs.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/3ee063e8-a226-11e8-9442-d78bd92b399f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
