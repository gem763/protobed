But with Liverpool\u2019s winning streak up to 15 matches and MK Dons coming off the back of two 1-0 home defeats, a shock win is looking unlikely for the Milton Keynes-based side.\n\nDespite Klopp being expected to play a weakened side, Liverpool will triumph in tonight\u2019s meeting. The match may not be as easy as expected though, with MK Dons using the match as an opportunity to prove themselves. Nonetheless, we\u2019re going for a victory for Liverpool", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0travel to Milton Keynes tonight to face MK Dons in their opening Carabao Cup match.
