Signed, Rose.\u201d \u201cDear Rose, so would I. Signed, Abby.\u201d\n\nGeorge Washington once observed, \u201cI have always considered marriage as the most interesting event in one\u2019s life, the foundation of happiness or misery.\u201d\n\nRecently, I preached on the subject of Marriage on the Rock (as in Jesus Christ) versus Marriage on the Rocks.\n\nMy long time pastor, Dr. D. James Kennedy, once noted that, before God created the church or the state, he created the family---beginning with marriage.\n\nMarriage is special to God. The Bible opens with a marriage. The Bible closes with a marriage. Marriage is the picture of the believer\u2019s relationship with Christ. That\u2019s why Satan aims his big guns at marriage.\n\nMarriage is good for society because it is the first defense against evil. Marriage is the building block of any community.\n\nGenerally, research shows people are happier when married, but you wouldn\u2019t necessarily know that in our culture at large. Nicholas H. Wolfinger asked in an article, \u201cAre Married People Still Happier?\u201d He concludes in the affirmative---that data collected from the General Social Survey (the GSS) indicates that \u201cmarried adults are much happier than unmarried adults.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, marriage is under siege today. But is that necessarily new? In 1983, the U.S. Senate held \u201cBroken Families Hearings.\u201d They drew from a Harvard historian named Carle Zimmerman who had described in 1947 the \u201clast stage of the disintegration\u201d of the cultures of Greece and Rome. Here\u2019s how Zimmerman described familial breakdown, which contributed to the fall of those ancient countries:\n\n1. Marriage loses its sacredness and is frequently broken by divorce....\n\n2. The traditional meaning of the marriage ceremony is lost. Alternate forms of marriage arise...\n\n3. Feminist movements abound....\n\n4. There is an increased public disrespect for parents, parenthood, and authority in general so that parenthood becomes harder for those who still try to rear children.\n\n5. There is an increase in juvenile delinquency, promiscuity, and rebellion.\n\n6. There is a refusal of people with traditional marriages to accept family responsibilities. 7. There is an increasing desire for---and acceptance of---adultery.\n\n7. There is a tolerance for---and spread of---sexual perversions of all kinds\u2026\n\nWhether it\u2019s Ancient Greece, Ancient Rome, 1947, 1983, or today, the breakdown of the family has incredible ramifications for society at large. As G. K. Chesterton observed, \u201cAs the family goes, so goes society.\u201d\n\nYet there are many who want to essentially destroy the family. I\u2019m reminded of the classic 1848 book,The Communist Manifesto, wherein Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels promote \u201cthe abolition of the family.\u201d The Marxists have succeeded remarkably in contributing to family breakdown. Dr. Paul Kengor documents all this in his book,Takedown.\n\nTwo years ago, a Google executive got negative pushback from his own company when he spoke highly of the family. He had to apologize and grovel, speaking of alternative \u201cfamily\u201d structures.\n\nBut I would take the Word of God Almighty, our Creator, any day over the word of some Silicon Valley executives or Marxist professors. One day some religious leaders asked Jesus if God allowed divorce \u201cfor any and every reason\u201d (NIV). \u201cAny and every reason\u201d? That sounds like today\u2019s no-fault divorce.\n\nJesus answered them by going back to creation itself: \u201cHave you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, \u2018Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh\u2019? So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate\u2019\u201d (ESV).\n\nI remember hearing of a divorce attorney who quipped as he was about to return to work from lunch, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got to get back to \u2018putting asunder what God hath joined together.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut I will note that how you get married---that is preparing well for marriage, not just the wedding---is exceedingly important. My wife (of 39 years now, by the grace of God) and I decided that before we got married, we would freely use the D-word, divorce; however, after we got married, we wouldn\u2019t even joke about it. We have stayed with that commitment.\n\nBible teacher M. R. Dehaan said, \u201cThe nearest thing to heaven on this earth is the Christian family and the home where husband and wife and parents and children live in love and peace together for the Lord and for each other.\u201d And the nearest thing to hell is the opposite.", "description": "Many years ago, when \u201cDear Abby\u201d was in many newspapers, .09/28/2019 6:16:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Jerry Newcombe", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2015/152/f05e56e4-7281-4b6a-ba83-174faa5c6cea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
