They have 10,000 more,\" Brian Weeden of the Secure World Foundation told Axios in an interview.\n\nBut there isn't that kind of redundancy for larger spacecraft.\n\nDriving the news: The European Space Agency (ESA) just shifted one of its satellites to avoid a possible collision with a SpaceX's Starlink satellite.\n\nAccording to SpaceX, a computer error prevented the company from seeing that odds of a collision were relatively high, but the breakdown in communication is a good example of problems that could crop up in the future.\n\n\"Today, this negotiation is done through exchanging emails \u2014 an archaic process that is no longer viable as increasing numbers of satellites in space mean more space traffic,\" Holger Krag, the head of space safety at ESA, said in a statement.\n\nState of play: Current means of tracking satellites by the U.S. Air Force and others have worked well until now, but experts say there's an urgent need for better monitoring and communication around what's in orbit.\n\n\"We don't even agree on where stuff is,\" Moriba Jah, an aerospace engineer and professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told Axios.\n\nThe Air Force's models simplify the trajectory of satellites, which means operators could make an unnecessary or incorrect maneuver that puts them in more harm, says Jah.\n\nYes, but: Better tracking is only half of the battle. Establishing a global, accurate space traffic management system with established rules of the road is also necessary, according to some experts.\n\nOneWeb, a company hoping to launch hundreds of satellites in the coming years to provide global internet, is advocating a design-based approach to reducing space junk.\n\nSpaceX's Starlink satellites have the ability to perform collision avoidance maneuvers autonomously, acting on data from the Air Force's tracking system, without input from operators on the ground.\n\nWhat to watch: The Trump administration, through its Space Policy Directive-3, hopes to put the Commerce Department in charge of many space traffic management duties.\n\nSupporters of the change say it will make tracking more open and accurate, but key parts of the directive are still awaiting Congressional approval.\n\nIn April, Commerce asked commercial companies how they might contribute to its plans to take on space traffic management.\n\nGo deeper: Satellite startup snags funding for \"cell towers in space\"", "description": "A fight could break out over who should bear the cost of managing it.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/pTI0wojMTSfwdRD_WlwA2E_Bsks=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/10/1568136298211.gif", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
