Reuters\n\nIt comes at a fractious time, as the country heads for a presidential election on September 28 that poses security, logistical and credibility problems for the government in the face of a looming and aggressive Taliban.\n\nFighting is an almost daily occurrence in at least 24 of the country's 34 provinces.\n\nGhani's government has already admitted that at least 2,000 of its 7,000 polling stations will be closed for the election because government forces cannot secure them, even with US help.\n\nRead more: Here's what's it's like inside the world's largest arms fair, where uniformed military officials survey the latest weapons and vehicles from the biggest names in the defense industry\n\nWith the arrival of multiple offensives, at least half a dozen districts \u2014 units of territory often comprising hundreds of square miles \u2014 fell to the Taliban.\n\nThe action shows that the group and its leadership, which is mostly based in Quetta, Pakistan, can keep their grim promises.\n\nAfghan officials Thursday admitted that Taliban forces were in control of districts in Takhar, Baghlan, Kunduz and Badakhshan provinces, in the north of the country, after a fresh round of attacks that followed Trump's cancellation of the negotiations.\n\nUS soldiers patrolling with Afghan National Army soldiers, February 28, 2012.

Both times they ceded the city only in the face of heavy US air strikes. It has again been the target of attacks this summer.\n\nVirtually no one argues that government forces would be capable of defending even these northern areas from Taliban attacks in the case of a US withdrawal, let alone maintain any control in the Taliban-dominated south.\n\nThe failure of Afghan security forces to maintain control without heavy US support had in part motivated the Trump administration to seek a withdrawal agreement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to Air Force personnel during an event September 15, 2017 at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.
