We knew how strong Ireland were,\u201d coach Jamie Joseph said in a pitchside interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re obviously ecstatic about the result. We\u2019re really proud of the players... We\u2019ve got another couple of games to go but we\u2019ll enjoy tonight I reckon.\u201d\n\nThe hosts, who had never beaten Ireland before, were utterly worthy winners and, having admitted that their nerves got the better of them in the 30-10 curtain-raising win over Russia, there was no repeat eight days later.\n\nThey came flying out of the blocks and, after Kotaro Matsushima was a bounce away from getting his fourth try of the World Cup, Tamura missed an easy penalty chance to turn 10 minutes of impressive phases into three points.\n\nHe would barely put a foot wrong after that.\n\nOnce Ireland got a foothold, their gameplan became obvious; attacking off the kind of forward pressure that smashed the Scots and testing the Japanese with the clever array of kicking from flyhalf Jack Carty, starting instead of the struggling Johnny Sexton.\n\nThe 27-year-old late bloomer, who started his first test last month and was not part of the Ireland set up until this year\u2019s Six Nations, found the dangerous Garry Ringrose with a pinpoint crossfield kick for the first try on 14 minutes and a dink over the top seven minutes later put Rob Kearney in.\n\nTamura knocked over a penalty in between the two tries and Japan showed the first signs that they were not going away. They already looked like they had Ireland on the ropes, with Tamura cutting the deficit with a second penalty.\n\nWith five minutes to go to the break the Irish threatened again and had what looked like a decisive attacking scrum against their lighter opponents.\n\nThe Japanese pack, however, then produced an extraordinary effort, destroying the Irish eight at the put-in and driving them backwards before winning a penalty.\n\nThe crowd rose, producing a huge roar which was matched by the players, prop Jiwon Koo and hooker Shota Horie screaming at the top of their voices. A potential 19-6 Irish halftime lead turned into just a 12-9 advantage as an exhausted-looking Irish defence looked happy to hear the halftime whistle.\n\n\u2018FURIOUS AND INTENSE\u2019\n\nJapan, who had never got within 16 points in seven previous defeats to Ireland, were back at it after the break with more high-tempo attacking play and Ireland already looked like they were hanging on as their penalty count inched up.\n\nShellshocked, Joe Schmidt\u2019s men were making uncharacteristic simple errors and Fukuoka, a last-minute addition to the bench after an injury to Will Tupou, sensationally gave Japan the lead with 20 minutes to go and Tamura slotted over his most difficult kick of the night to make it 16-12.\n\nIreland, who chose not to risk the struggling Sexton, simply had no answer and with the home fans getting louder and louder, Tamura extended the lead to seven points eight minutes from time.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nJapan finished the game deep in the Irish half to top a pool Ireland were heavy favourites to win, although Schmidt noted how crucial his team\u2019s losing bonus point might prove to be.\n\n\u201cWe played well in the first quarter and got out to a 12-3 lead and then we stopped playing,\u201d said Schmidt as fireworks lit up the Shizuoka sky in front of Japan\u2019s exuberant fans dressed in red and white.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to Japan, what a furious and intense performance that was! We\u2019re really disappointed we couldn\u2019t control the finish but they are a really good team.\u201d", "description": "Hosts Japan stunned Ireland 19-12 in an extraordinary upset on Saturday to win their second match of the Rugby World Cup and put themselves in pole position to reach the knockout stages for the first time.", "authors": ["Padraic Halpin", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434833860&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R088", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
