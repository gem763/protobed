USA TODAY\n\nA controversial interference call during the seventh inning of Game 6 is a moment baseball fans will be talking about all offseason, and many MLB players were outraged over the call.\n\nFollowing an apparent infield single from Trea Turner and a missed throw by pitcher Brad Peacock, the Nationals provisionally had runners on second and third with zero outs with a 3-2 lead \u2014 but Turner was ruled out for interfering with the throw to first. The Nationals attempted to lodge a formal protest over the call, but were denied, and manager Dave Martinez was ejected from the game for erupting on the umpires.\n\nAstros fan Kate Upton, who watched husband Justin Verlander give up three earned runs in five innings, broke her Twitter silence during the World Series to explain the rule to fans who may be confused.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t within the base path. Those who don\u2019t know the rule you HAVE to run inside the 2 lines. Not sure why the review is taking so long... pic.twitter.com/SzUJTA4L70 \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) October 30, 2019\n\nUpton \u2014 who has 2.3 million followers on Twitter \u2014 checked her replies, which prompted a follow-up tweet.\n\nI LOVE talking about sports and reading all of the dumb misogynist comments. It reminds me that women need to keep fighting for equality. It\u2019s 2019 but feels like the 1950s. #feminist \u2014 Kate Upton (@KateUpton) October 30, 2019\n\nFollow the bizarre sequence, Washington\u2019s Anthony Rendon responded immediately with a two-run homer to extend the Nationals\u2019 lead to 5-2. The Nationals won, 7-2, to force a decisive Game 7 on Wednesday night.\n\nFollow For The Win's Nick Schwartz on Twitter @Nick_Schwartz.", "description": "Kate Upton, wife of Houston Astros pitcher Justin Verlander, broke her Twitter silence during a controversial moment in Game 6 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Nicholas Schwartz", "Published A.M.
