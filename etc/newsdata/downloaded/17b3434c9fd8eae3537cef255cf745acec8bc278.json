Preventing congenital syphilis requires testing pregnant women for syphilis the first time they see their doctors. Then, health-department employees have to follow up with them to be sure they get treated\u2014with as many as three doses of an antibiotic.\n\nBut since the 2008 recession, the municipal health department workforce has shrunk by almost a quarter, says Adriane Casalotti, the chief of government and public affairs at the National Association of County and City Health Officials. That makes it harder for officials to follow pregnant women to be sure they\u2019re getting their antibiotic doses, or to reach out to doctors and community leaders to raise awareness about the rise of syphilis. And the overall lack of funding means many health departments can\u2019t pay for all the tests and medications they need to catch other types of STDs.\n\nWith tax revenue low during the recession, states and municipalities were looking for programs to cut, Casalotti and others say, and in the late aughts, STD prevention seemed like a reasonable area for savings. Certain STDs had been declining in the \u201990s, and in 2000 syphilis was close to being eliminated. STDs simply weren\u2019t seen as much of a threat. And to the extent that they were, it was easy to blame the victims. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of assumptions that these are adults and they should be making better choices, and if they did, there wouldn\u2019t be the spread of STDs,\u201d Casalotti says.\n\nRead: The overblown stigma of genital herpes\n\nBut after the recession ended, state and local funding for STD programs never came back. Federal funding for syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia prevention has also remained far below the level public-health advocates have requested, as my colleague Russell Berman and I reported in 2016. \u201cWe're doing less with less,\u201d Bill Smith, the executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told us then. \u201cThe public's health is in danger.\u201d Three years later, the consequences of doing less are becoming ever more clear.\n\nPublic-health advocates say policymakers are essentially asleep at the wheel as STDs creep up slowly and claim more lives. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of public, provider, and policymaker knowledge about what\u2019s happening in STDs, and many consider these to be infections of a bygone era,\u201d Matthew Prior, the communications director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, told me via email. \u201cLike, who gets syphilis anymore?\u201d Last year, 486 school buses\u2019 worth of people did.", "description": "And now we\u2019re suffering the consequences.", "authors": ["Olga Khazan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_18135060525045/facebook.jpg?1570549658", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
