REUTERS/Mike Segar/Illustration/File Photo/File Photo\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, J&J announced that other labs it hired ultimately found no asbestos in samples from the bottle tested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or from the same production lot.\n\nIn challenging the FDA\u2019s finding, however, the healthcare giant is casting doubt on one of its own experts.\n\nThe private Maryland lab that found asbestos in Baby Powder under a contract with the FDA is run by a paid expert witness for J&J.\n\nAndreas Saldivar, laboratory director of AMA Analytical Services Inc, has served as a litigation expert on several occasions for J&J since 2017 in its defense against plaintiffs\u2019 claims that asbestos in talc caused their cancers.\n\nHe testified in a May 2018 deposition that testing he did in 2010 for the FDA showed no evidence of asbestos in Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, helping to bolster the company\u2019s argument that its iconic brand is safe.\n\nSaldivar\u2019s lab began testing cosmetic talc products for the FDA again this year, and in September it found asbestos in an unmarked sample that the FDA later identified as Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder.\n\n\u201cI have never heard of anything like this,\u201d said Richard Ausness, a University of Kentucky law professor who specializes in product liability, referring to Saldivar\u2019s dual roles. \u201cThis is bad news for J&J. The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J&J for years, and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there.\u201d\n\nJ&J\u2019s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness, Ausness said.\n\n\u201cJ&J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent, but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for,\u201d Ausness said.\n\nThe company appeared to do just that on Tuesday, saying testing done by other laboratories J&J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA, nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar\u2019s finding.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results. They also said they were not surprised by J&J\u2019s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results.\n\nThe company \u201cwould say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,\u201d said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA\u2019s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.\n\nPlaintiffs\u2019 attorneys said Saldivar\u2019s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J&J\u2019s defense in court. The company faces lawsuits from more than 16,000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer.\n\nThe impact was immediate in one courtroom.\n\nHours after J&J disclosed the FDA\u2019s asbestos finding on Oct. 18, a plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Nate Finch, asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71-year-old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer.\n\nJ&J\u2019s lawyers opposed the request, arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company, but the judge granted Finch\u2019s request. Days later, Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J&J, a trial transcript shows. Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution.\n\nJ&J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case. The company declined to comment on Saldivar\u2019s role in the FDA testing, or on how it might affect the company\u2019s legal strategy going forward.\n\nSaldivar declined to comment.\n\nNO SAFE LEVELS\n\nIn a June deposition, Saldivar said J&J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in \u201cmaybe 20 or 30\u201d cases. His firm bills $200 to $350 an hour for his services, he testified.\n\nUnder the FDA contract, his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept. 7, according to the lab\u2019s report. J&J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct. 16, prompting the company to recall 33,000 bottles \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nIn response, some major U.S. retailers have said they are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson\u2019s baby powder from their shelves.\n\nAt the same time, the company has expressed suspicions about the finding, saying it had launched its own investigation \u201cto determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, the FDA posted online Saldivar\u2019s 16-page report to the agency on the analysis of J&J Baby Powder. In samples weighing less than a gram, the lab said it found six chrysotile asbestos fibers. Given that the samples were extremely small, the asbestos could amount to millions of fibers per gram, testing experts told Reuters.\n\nWhile most people exposed to asbestos never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn\u2019t been established. The World Health Organization and other health authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos, a known carcinogen.\n\n\u201cSince there are no known safe levels of asbestos, the FDA has asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall their products when fibers consistent with asbestos are found in them,\u201d the agency said this month.\n\nSeveral juries over the past two years have concluded that Baby Powder exposures caused cancer and have awarded plaintiffs more than $5 billion. Other juries have sided with J&J, and some cases have settled.\n\n\u2018JUST NOT CORRECT\u2019\n\nThe FDA has never before announced that government testing found asbestos in J&J\u2019s Baby Powder. Since the early 1970s, J&J has pushed back hard on reports of asbestos in its talc by outside scientists, plaintiffs\u2019 experts and, on several occasions, by its own testing labs.\n\nIn an Oct. 3 deposition in a New York lawsuit, J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky dismissed the findings of asbestos over the years, saying \u201cthey were later shown to be inaccurate, incomplete and just not correct.\u201d\n\nAttacking Saldivar\u2019s finding, some legal experts told Reuters, could hurt the company\u2019s ability to use him as a witness in lawsuits and undercut its broader message to jurors and consumers. That message boils down to: Trust our experts.\n\nBut a product liability defense lawyer who helped organize a recent talc litigation symposium said the impact on pending cases could be limited because asbestos-related cancers are known to take decades to develop. The FDA\u2019s new finding \u201cwould be difficult to tie\u201d to cancers allegedly caused by long-ago exposures, said Edward Ulloa, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who does not represent J&J.\n\nThe FDA findings are \u201cessentially anecdotal,\u201d Ulloa said, \u201cspecific to that product and that particular sample.\u201d\n\nIn its Tuesday announcement, J&J said that one of the labs it hired initially found asbestos in three samples of Baby Powder, but the lab determined that a portable air conditioner running when the samples were prepared was contaminated with asbestos. Subsequent tests in a different room found no asbestos, the company said.\n\nNO EXPERIENCE, NO ASBESTOS\n\nIn 2010, when the AMA lab tested 34 talc products for the FDA, including Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, the lab had no experience looking for asbestos fibers in talc milled for powders and cosmetics.\n\nSaldivar testified in several depositions that the lab\u2019s work had previously focused on determining the amount of asbestos in old building products, such as vinyl flooring.\n\nAMA made fast work of the 2010 FDA job, lab records reviewed by Reuters show. His lab examined 102 samples, three from each product, in a single day, using a method called transmission electron microscopy (TEM). That works out to less than five minutes per sample, assuming an eight-hour shift with no breaks.\n\nExperts who have found asbestos in milled talc powders told Reuters they require anywhere from a half hour to a day per sample using TEM, and litigation records show they often look at more talc per sample than Saldivar has testified is the practice at AMA.\n\nIn a deposition earlier this year, Saldivar acknowledged that he looked at less talc per sample than others in the field and that looking at more talc \u201cwould raise your analytical sensitivity\u201d - the ability to find any contamination. But he said he believed that his methods were sufficient.\n\nAfter the AMA lab found no asbestos in 2010, the FDA cautioned against reading too much into the results - not because of the sensitivity of the test but because so few products were tested.\n\nThough the agency has described the testing as using the \u201cmost sensitive techniques available,\u201d it said the results \u201cdo not prove that most or all talc or talc-containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination.\u201d\n\nWhen J&J\u2019s lawyers approached Saldivar a few years ago about serving as an expert and testing Baby Powder, they \u201cwanted me to follow my protocols that I used on my FDA testing\u201d in 2010, Saldivar testified in May 2018. In June, he testified that his lab had never found any asbestos in talc samples, including Baby Powder, that it had tested for J&J and other manufacturer defendants.\n\nThe testing by Saldivar\u2019s lab for the FDA this year was a different story.\n\n\u201cThis positive test turns up the heat on J&J,\u201d said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford University law professor who studies complex litigation. \u201cAnd their expert lit the match.\u201d", "description": "Ever since Johnson & Johnson disclosed this month that a government test had turned up asbestos in its Baby Powder, the company has attacked the validity of the result.", "authors": ["Chad Terhune", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446485251&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0NH", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
