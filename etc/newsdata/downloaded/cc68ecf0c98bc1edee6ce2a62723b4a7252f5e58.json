But for CareerBuilder, the technology is actually helping to find people work.\n\nAs with many other job functions, AI is leading to massive changes in human-resources departments across corporate America. The technology can reduce bias in hiring and automate many of the more mundane job tasks. But there still remains a hesitancy to adopt it, given the strict set of employment laws that companies must adhere to and the opacity of how the AI actually comes to a decision.\n\nAt CareerBuilder, the employment platform is harnessing AI to reduce the number of vendors that HR departments typically work with on recruitment, improve the quality of job postings, and, ultimately, better match candidates to open positions.\n\nThat can even mean finding jobs that, at face value, would seem unrelated to a certain position but actually rely on many of the same skill sets, like veterinary technicians and prison guards. The company is also using the tech to help candidates craft better resumes and make it easier to apply for jobs on mobile devices.\n\n\"The HR industry is going through a change that it has never gone through before,\" CEO Irina Novoselsky told Business Insider. \"We've actually brought the AI to the fingertips of recruiters.\"\n\nCareerBuilder, which is known for its signature job platform but provides services such as background checks and candidate tracking, is relied on by 70% of the Fortune 500 companies, the company said, giving it immense insight into the top hiring challenges that firms face. Novoselsky outlined how AI would only improve CareerBuilder's ability to address those problems.\n\nReduction in vendors and applications, improvements in hiring\n\nThe historic metric of success in HR departments was getting the largest number of applications possible for an opening. That, theoretically, gave companies ample qualified candidates to choose from, according to Novoselsky.\n\nBut that pool also required the typical recruiting team to sift through hundreds of resumes. And once they advanced applicants, the departments often had to work with as many as 15 different vendors in the hiring process, including for background checks and the onboarding process.\n\n\"Having a lot of volume was considered a good thing. Now, with the advent of AI and technology, HR functions are having to fundamentally change what they consider successful [to] the least amount of candidates that are the most qualified,\" Novoselsky said.\n\nCareerBuilder is trying to replace all of that. It offers several applications that can help organizations reduce their catalog of vendors, including tracking the supply and demand for candidates in specific markets. And on the recruitment side, the company is using AI to aid companies in crafting better job postings.\n\nRead more: The head of IBM's Watson walks us through the exact model tech leaders can use to build excitement around any AI project\n\nBusinesses, for example, often seek tech employees who can code in Hadoop, an open-source-software platform, and Java, a common programming language. Some candidates, however, may list only one or the other on their resume, which could lead HR departments to disregard those applications. Using analytics, however, CareerBuilder found that 95% of people that list one or the other actually have the ability to code in both.\n\nThe technology can also analyze the job descriptions of existing employees to determine whether an internal candidate is better suited for an opening. There's also the added benefit of alerting companies to people they may have never considered for some roles.\n\nThere's a large demand, for example, for prison guards, according to Novoselsky. Using AI to analyze the skill sets that are required for the role, CareerBuilder found an unlikely match: veterinary technicians. Both need to exhibit skills like compassion and be able to remain calm in high-stress environments.\n\n\"When you say a title, you paint already the image of what the person filling that role looks like,\" she said. \"Removing that image and really doing it based on the underlying skill set\" uncovers new possibilities.\n\nBetter job descriptions, better matches\n\nThe heart of the recruitment process is still the job posting.\n\nIt's the first thing many candidates see, and it can be the make-or-break moment between a qualified person applying for a role or moving along to the next opening. CareerBuilder is hoping to improve those postings, which can vary wildly, from highly detailed to overly generic.\n\nUsing AI, the company grades a job description on how a candidate would perceive it and provides recommendations on how to improve it, whether that be the need for more specific language, a change to gender-neutral pronouns, or alerts to wording that may be viewed as socioeconomically biased.\n\nThe technology can also notify organizations if they are seeking talent in regions where there aren't enough qualified candidates to meet the demands they are seeking.\n\n\"We know every single company across North America, and we know every single job they've ever posted,\" Novoselsky said. \"We took all that data, and we created something that works on both sides.\"\n\nThe applications have added benefits aside from finding the most talented people for roles. CareerBuilder, for example, helped one of the US's largest investment banks double its amount of diversity company-wide, covering gender, age, and race.\n\nWhile AI is becoming more common, the technology is still just in its early stages. So while CareerBuilder is pursuing many initiatives now, it's likely that even more advanced applications are on the way.", "description": "The rise of AI is spurring fears of job loss, but CareerBuilder is actually using the tech to try to better match people to vacancies.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da87038cc4a0a3b541a9cbd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
