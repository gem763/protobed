The 2-year note yield, TMUBMUSD02Y, +4.58%, sensitive to expectations for interest-rate policy, added 6.6 basis points to 1.466%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +1.74%, rose 2.5 basis points to 2.043%.\n\nYields on bonds move in the opposite direction as price.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nThe market is eager for signs of progress on the U.S.-China trade front, which has put downward pressure on the economies of the world\u2019s two-largest trading partners.\n\nU.S. stocks were slightly lower in trade even after White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow suggested the U.S. and China could be open to a short-term deal to avoid a deepening of the trade conflict.\n\nStocks started out lower in trading after Bloomberg News reported on Sunday said that the Chinese delegation would arrive for discussions in Washington with terms for a deal that won\u2019t include \u201ccommitments on reforming Chinese industrial policy\u201d or \u201cgovernment subsidies.\u201d\n\nAhead of the trade talks, pressure on Trump has been mounting after a second whistleblower came forth to provide information about the U.S. president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, which are at the heart of an ongoing House impeachment inquiry into whether Trump used the Oval Office to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter and his office later tried to eliminate evidence relating to the matter.\n\nAlso, a federal judge in New York City on Monday ordered Trump to hand over eight years of corporate and personal tax returns to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, rejecting the argument that sitting U.S. presidents are immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nCheck out: The Elizabeth Warren stock-market correction will happen sooner than you think: RBC\n\nOn the central bank front, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said Monday that he was unsure how many more rate cuts are needed to support the economy. \u201cMy message is clear, we should be supporting the economy, not tapping the brakes,\u201d Kashkari said during a question-and-answer session at a Native American finance officers conference in Prior Lake, Minn.\n\nFriday\u2019s job report meanwhile showed that the U.S. unemployment rate fell to a 50-year low of 3.5%, but that wages bumped up only 2.9%, their weakest gain in more than a year, which could rattle consumers, a core driver of the American economy.\n\nWhat are market participants saying?\n\nAll eyes will be on the coming Sino-American trade talks set for Thursday and Friday.\n\n\u201cThe market is certainly paying a lot of attention on the trade front,\u201d said Donald Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies group at Federated Investors Inc, in an interview. \u201cBut I would also have to say, it does feel like the market is getting a little bit desensitized to every headline and tweet on the trade front.\u201d\n\nEllenberger said market participants will be keeping an eye on fresh economic data released this week and the coming U.S. Treasury debt auctions of 10-year and 30-year paper on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn general, there\u2019s been a reasonable bid for that paper, but the street, as they always do, tries to cheapen up ahead of the auctions,\u201d he said.\n\nHussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said there was \u201cno doubt that concerns over the outlook of global economic growth have severely intensified over the past couple of months due to the U.S.-China trade dispute,\u201d in a note.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump may be willing to accept an amended deal to avoid a further selloff on Wall Street, especially with the ongoing impeachment inquiry. However, it remains unclear whether the Chinese will provide concessions on industrial policies or government subsidies, which have been a critical demand for the U.S. administration,\u201d he said.", "description": "Traders are keeping a close eye on U.S.-China trade talks that are set to resume later this week amid signs that the economies of the world\u2019s two-largest...", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
