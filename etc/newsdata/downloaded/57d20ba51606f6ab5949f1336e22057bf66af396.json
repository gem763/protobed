The insulation is designed to withstand a temperature range of -150C to 120C.\n\n\u201cIf we remember the Apollo generation, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin bunny-hopped on the surface of the moon,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cNow we are actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different from our suits of the past.\u201d\n\nA new orange pressure suit, the Orion crew survival system, was worn by the spacesuit engineer Dustin Gohmert. It will be used by astronauts when they launch into space on the Orion capsule and return to Earth.\n\nThe focus on spacesuits designed to fit a more diverse crew comes after plans for the first all-female spacewalk had to be scrapped this year because there were not enough medium-size spacesuits.\n\nChristina Koch and Anne McClain had been scheduled to step outside the International Space Station to install batteries, but in the event only Koch was able to take part in the walk.\n\nAnother attempt at an all-female spacewalk, involving Koch and Jessica Meir, is scheduled to take place on Thursday. The pair plan to embark on a six-hour outing to replace faulty batteries.", "description": "Next-generation garments for Artemis programme will be used during 2024 lunar mission", "authors": ["Hannah Devlin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10f536de3bd4c53685e516de7512a25ec64fbf1a/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29a37e1ead2f2f991d3314c654a1dc3f", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
