Or have my brain,\u201d explained the 33-year-old. \u201cSo, I\u2019m only reminded of how bad my memory is when people I see, they come to me and go, \u2018Oh, you remember when we did this?\u2019 \u2018Remember we went on this trip to this country?\u2019 And I have no recollection of it. But in my head, it\u2019s not like I feel bad or sad about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do when I think about it, but it\u2019s just the way life is,\u201d continued \u201cThe Black String\u201d star. \u201cI only know what it\u2019s like to be me and if I don\u2019t let it bother me, I just try to live the most fulfilling, best life I can. I really try to take advantage of my time. And I\u2019ve got a lot in my life.\u201d\n\nMuniz starred in \u201cMalcolm in the Middle\u201d from 2000 until 2006. The actor insisted he\u2019s grateful he\u2019s had a diverse career over the years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to do, like, all my dream jobs I\u2019ve ever wanted,\u201d Muniz told the outlet. \u201cActor, race car driver, drummer. I got to do all these great things and it\u2019s because I have drive. I just want to keep moving forward so I don\u2019t really dwell too much on the past.\"\n\nFRANKIE MUNIZ REVEALS ON 'DANCING WITH THE STARS' HE SUFFERS FROM SEVERE MEMORY LOSS\n\nMuniz is set to tie the knot with his fianc\u00e9e Paige Price. Muniz proposed to Price in November 2018.\n\n\u201cPage and I, we don\u2019t spend a minute apart,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get bored of her. \u201c[The wedding is] going to happen pretty soon. Well, within a year, within 2019.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Entertainment Weekly reported Muniz suffered from nine concussions. The first one occurred at age 7 while playing goalie in a soccer game. The next came when he tripped and fell on his head during basketball. Then two more occurred during pee-wee football sometime around seventh grade. At the time, Muniz couldn\u2019t recall when the others occurred. However, he knows he had a few while racing cars in his 20s after \u201cMalcolm in the Middle.\u201d\n\nThe actor's shocking revelation was first made when he was a contestant on \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d Muniz told EW he\u2019s been in and out of ERs and clinics after suffering from \u201cat least\u201d 15 transient ischemic attacks (TIAS) or mini-strokes that involve a temporary clot or blockage in the brain.\n\nFRANKIE MUNIZ OPENS UP ABOUT 2011 GUN INCIDENT: IT WAS 'A FAKE OVERBLOWN STORY'\n\nThe outlet shared the first one occurred in 2012 when he was riding a motorcycle. Muniz lost his peripheral vision and barely recognized his then-girlfriend and mother.\n\n\u201cBy that point, I already had had nine concussions,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut concussions don\u2019t usually correlate with TIAs. The doctors did every test. A lot of times with TIAs, there\u2019s a small hole in the heart that causes it. Clots go to the brain and you have a mini-stroke. I don\u2019t have that hole.\u201d\n\nMuniz also shared that he\u2019s always been a healthy guy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never sipped alcohol, I\u2019ve never touched a drug or taken a drag of a cigarette,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve felt was stress. I\u2019m a high-strung person. I just like to always be moving. I\u2019m not good at relaxing.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something I think about,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t go, \u2018Oh man I\u2019m really scared, I really need to know.\u2019 I just move forward.\u201d", "description": "Frankie Muniz isn\u2019t letting his severe memory loss get the best of him.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nolasco"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1012898298.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
