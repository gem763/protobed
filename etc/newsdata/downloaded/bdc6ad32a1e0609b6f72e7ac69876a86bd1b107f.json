If that is not foreshadowed, traders expect the dollar to rise.\n\n\"If the market is going to price in the end of current rate-cut cycle, the dollar/yen could climb above 110 yen,\" said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan Chase Bank.\n\n\"On the other hand, if the market is going to price in two more cuts after this month's expected cut, the pair could fall to mid-107 yen level,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nRISK ASSETS\n\nOptimism that Washington and Beijing would finalise the first-stage of a trade deal next month had boosted risk assets in recent days, but markets have turned wary.\n\nA U.S. administration official said on Tuesday an interim trade agreement between the United States and China might not be completed in time for signing on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific summit in Chile next month, but that does not mean the accord is falling apart.\n\nThe Chinese yuan inched up marginally as investors awaited the outcome of the Fed meeting and more clarity on how Sino-U.S. trade negotiations are going.\n\nIn the spot market, offshore spot yuan was last changing hands at 7.0580, a touch firmer on the day.\n\nEarlier in the onshore market, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate at a two-month high of 7.0582 per dollar, 35 pips firmer than Tuesday's fix.\n\nSterling meanwhile drew support from hopes that a disorderly Brexit can be avoided.\n\nBritain will hold its first December election in almost a century after Prime Minister Boris Johnson won approval from the House of Commons on Tuesday for an early ballot aimed at breaking the deadlock over the UK leaving the European Union\n\nThe British pound was last at $1.2874, little changed on the day and below five-month highs hit earlier this month. It was also steady at 86.34 pence.\n\n\"Johnson has cross-party support and (the opposition) Labour Party has lost a fair lot of the credibility it had in the 2017 election,\" said MUFG's Halpenny.\n\n\"So that's reflected in the stability in sterling - markets believe the Conservative party will hold on to power and have a Brexit deal agreed with the EU.\" (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Tomo Uetake in TOKYO; Editing by Giles Elgood)", "description": "The dollar was steady against other major currencies on Wednesday as investors braced for a rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and an advance reading of economic growth in the third quarter that could shed light on the rate outlook.
