REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n\n(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has asked for a substantial cut in the National Security Council staff, Bloomberg reported late on Friday, citing five people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe step was described by some sources cited in the report as part of an effort from the White House to make its foreign policy arm leaner.\n\nThe request to do so was conveyed to officials in the agency by current White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien earlier this week, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe reductions at the agency, in which currently 310 people work, will be carried out through attrition, Bloomberg reported. The report did not mention the exact number by which Trump is looking to cut the agency\u2019s staff.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nThe development comes as Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are examining whether there are grounds to impeach Republican Trump based on a whistleblower\u2019s account that said he asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to help investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.\n\nLawmakers are investigating concerns that Trump\u2019s actions have jeopardized national security and the integrity of U.S. elections.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump has asked for a substantial cut in the National Security Council staff, Bloomberg reported late on Friday, citing five people familiar with the plans.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437279588&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9402K", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
