(AP) - A meme on social media shows Miami Hurricanes first-year coach Manny Diaz holding a turnover chain in each hand, with a zero dangling from the links on his right, and a two dangling to his left.\n\nAs in 0-2, which is the Hurricanes\u2019 record.\n\nPretty funny.\n\nMiami fans aren\u2019t laughing.\n\nThe Hurricanes are off to their worst start since 1978 and are in desperate need of a win. Cue Saturday\u2019s opponent, the Bethune-Cookman Wildcats (1-0).\n\nHere are things to know as Miami tries again to give Diaz his first victory:\n\nSTAYING POSITIVE\n\nThe Hurricanes led in the fourth quarter on the road against Florida and North Carolina, but lost the two games by a total of seven points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sucking it up,\u201d running back Cam\u2019Ron Harris said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to punish Bethune-Cookman.\u201d\n\nThe season\u2019s start is not what Diaz envisioned when he replaced Mark Richt. But with the next five games at home, and only one Top 25 team left on the schedule, a turnaround is a distinct possibility.\n\n\u201cWe think it is possible to be angry and optimistic at the same time,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly angry at the result and the things that we did that led to the result, but from what we see in our performance, there are a lot of reasons to still be optimistic - not just optimistic in terms of what\u2019s available for us this season, but also optimistic for where we think this program is going.\u201d\n\nThe improvement of freshman quarterback Jarren Williams has given Miami reason for encouragement. He was sacked 10 times in the opener but bounced back to go 30 for 39 for 309 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions at North Carolina.\n\nMISMATCH?\n\nMiami is 4-0 against Bethune-Cookman, all since 2011, winning by a combined score of 169-37. The Hurricanes won the most recent meeting in 2017, 41-13.\n\nAnd right now they\u2019ll take a victory over anybody.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if were playing the Denver Broncos, Alabama or Clemson,\u201d tight end Brevin Jordan said. \u201cThe whole point is we\u2019re trying to win some games.\u201d\n\nUNDEFEATED\n\nThe Wildcats scored all of their points in the second half to beat Jackson State 36-15 in their season opener. Akevious Williams threw for 144 yards and ran for 53.\n\nBethune-Cookman\u2019s game last Saturday against Southeastern Louisiana was canceled because of Hurricane Dorian.\n\nCHAIN OVERKILL?\n\nWhile the turnover chain is mocked on social media, it had a low profile last week at North Carolina. The Hurricanes had no takeaways, ending their streak of 13 consecutive games with at least one turnover.\n\nMight the much beloved and much reviled bling thing be a bit over the top?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s excessive,\u201d defensive lineman Scott Patchan said. \u201cIt boosts morale. We just need to get it out now.\u201d\n\nHOME SWEET HOME\n\nThe Hurricanes are 11-0 in home openers at the Miami Dolphins\u2019 stadium, outscoring opponents 500-69.\n\nBut Miami supporters are in a bad mood, and the crowd could turn quickly on the Hurricanes if they get off to a slow start in a game they\u2019re expected to win.\n\n\u201cEverything the fans are saying, internally everybody is harder on themselves in this building,\u201d Patchan said. \u201cWe have to if we want to be great.\u201d\n\nThe last time the Hurricanes started 0-3 was in 1975.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A meme on social media shows Miami Hurricanes first-year coach Manny Diaz holding a turnover chain in each hand, with a zero dangling from the links on his right, and a two dangling to his left.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steven Wine"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
