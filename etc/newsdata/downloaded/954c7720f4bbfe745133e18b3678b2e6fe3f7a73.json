For now, Republicans are the party on the defensive, flummoxed by the cascading disclosures about Mr. Trump that have threatened to upend his re-election campaign.\n\nBut there is also a general recognition, at every level of the Democratic Party, that impeachment could complicate their candidates\u2019 efforts to explain their policy ideas to the country and persuade voters they have a vision beyond ousting Mr. Trump. The party has been disappointed too many times, its leaders say, by betting that Mr. Trump\u2019s violations of political and cultural norms would bring about his downfall.\n\nOn Friday evening, Ms. Pelosi declared at a conference of New Jersey Democrats in Atlantic City that she would not allow the 2020 election to become a campaign about impeachment. Insisting the inquiry \u201chas nothing to do with the election,\u201d she said the campaign would be fought on other terms.\n\n[Sign up for our politics newsletter and join the conversation around the 2020 presidential race.]\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s about facts and the Constitution,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said of the impeachment process. \u201cThe election is about all of the issues and policies that we have a difference of opinion with the Republicans on, and they are very drastic \u2014 and they have nothing to do with impeachment.\u201d", "description": "The party is bracing for a pitched battle with President Trump that will likely overshadow its policy agenda.
