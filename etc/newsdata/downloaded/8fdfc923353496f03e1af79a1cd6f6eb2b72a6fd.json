Validating the change, the NSW government will move more than 4000 public servants into the project. \u201cThere was no way an 80-storey residential tower was going to work,\u201d Walker says. \u201cAnd from a good planning perspective, what Parramatta needed was a proper CBD.\u201d\n\nThose who did not exit are enduring lower sales, falling prices and tougher competition. Triguboff has cut his prices by about 20 per cent over the past year. The apartments he does not sell, he holds and rents. \u201cI would be worried if I had to drop my rents, but that has not happened yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI can lease 150 apartments in a week.\u201d\n\nNigel Satterley, whose Satterley Property Group is the country\u2019s biggest private residential land developer, takes the pulse of the market by touring sales offices on weekends. In his home town of Perth, he saw sales rates plunge in 2018 to record lows. \u201cOur prices have come back around 10 to 20 per cent in good areas,\u201d he says.\n\nHis group is insulated by relatively low gearing but has nevertheless adjusted to the lower level of activity. \u201cWe are being very prudent with construction, we are keeping sensible levels of stock, and we are keeping our statutory approvals up to date,\u201d he says. Like a number of Rich Listers, Satterley is also providing second-tier developers with finance as the banks toughen their criteria or withdraw. And both Triguboff and Satterley are looking for new sites. \u201cThere will be a recalibration of prices for broadacre land and we are in the market for correctly priced acquisitions,\u201d Satterley says.\n\nIn theory, there should be some great buying because the value of raw land falls the most in a downturn, far more than the value of houses. But so far that has not happened. \u201cThe banks aren\u2019t foreclosing,\u201d Triguboff says.\n\nOther developers are focusing on niche markets. Tim Gurner is developing \u201cultra-luxury\u201d downsizer apartments with 1000 ready for off-the-plan sale in coming months. In his flagship project, St Moritz in Melbourne\u2019s St Kilda, he has pre-sold one $30 million residence. In early April, a further five penthouses sold in 30 hours for nearly $80 million. \u201cI don\u2019t agree about the top of the market for this product,\u201d Gurner says. \u201cThe market is just starting. I could not have done this three years ago.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTriguboff, Walker and Satterley share that confidence. None of them worry that a 40-year housing cycle is coming to an end. If Australia\u2019s population continues to grow, the nation will need more homes. And as the downturn bites, the supply of new homes will fall. In several years, rents will start to rise and the cycle will begin again.\n\n\u201cAll these other developments are coming to an end and the Chinese are not buying. It must be all right,\u201d says Triguboff, who has already noted the return of a regular \u201crhythm\u201d to his sales. Says Walker: \u201cMy feeling is that greenfield [new detached housing] is critically undersupplied, particularly in Sydney. In the short term, apartments are in oversupply and we see that continuing for a couple of years. But natural attrition will work through that oversupply.\u201d\n\nPaul Little. Paul Jeffers\n\nSatterley adds: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough, pretty competitive two years. But Australia will keep growing at around a million people every three years.\u201d\n\nThe developers and owners of Australia\u2019s office towers and logistics facilities are even more confident about the outlook. Walker intends to hold for the long term his major commercial projects, Collins Square in Melbourne \u2013 \u201cwhere there is not a square metre left to lease\u201d \u2013 along with Festival Plaza in Adelaide and Parramatta Square. \u201cAs I get older, I need to have an income stream,\u201d says Walker, who\u2019s almost 74.\n\nEven a young apartment developer like Gurner, 37, is now planning commercial projects to hold, including in Melbourne\u2019s Fitzroy North. The one weaker sector in commercial property is retail, where the shopping centres are exposed to sluggish consumer spending and the predations of online shopping.\n\nRich Listers, in general, have continued to invest with confidence in their own homes. Through all of the housing turmoil, they have traded, upgraded and extended their mansions and penthouses, seemingly oblivious to the downturn outside their gates.\n\nThose who\u2019ve leapt into the market since the start of 2018 include Jerry Schwartz (Vaucluse, NSW for $67 million), Tony Tartak (Airlie Beach, Qld for $14 million), Richard Scheinberg (Bellevue Hill, NSW for $58 million), John Kinghorn (Mosman, NSW for $10 million) and Prudence MacLeod (Potts Point, NSW for $14 million). Clive Palmer shelled out $24 million for four luxury residences around Queensland. In February, Owen Kerr lodged a caveat over a mansion in South Yarra, Victoria, bought for a reported $30 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast September, Atlassian co-founder and co-chief executive Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie bought Fairwater, the historic former Fairfax mansion, and its 1.12 hectares of land. Fairwater is the biggest private waterfront estate on Sydney Harbour, at Point Piper, less than five kilometres from the Sydney CBD. At $100 million, the purchase broke all records for an Australian home.\n\nThe year before, Atlassian\u2019s other co-founder and co-chief executive, Scott Farquhar, had bought the adjoining harbour-front Fairfax residence, Elaine, for what was then a record $71 million.\n\n\u201cThese homes are in their own market. It is not affected by the things that normally affect residential markets,\u201d says the agent who handled the sales, the managing director of Christie\u2019s International in Australia, Ken Jacobs.\n\nHarry Triguboff: \"I have no competition.\" Louise Kennerley\n\nWhich brings us back to Triguboff. Over 55 years, he has built Meriton into an unrivalled apartment operation. \u201cToday, I have 10,000 units to build and I am looking for more ... I have no competition,\u201d he says. Looking through the cycle, his real challenge is not the market, but succession and the long-term future of Meriton. His grandchildren have joined the business and Triguboff is adding his decades of experience and business smarts to their technical skills.\n\n\u201cYou have to have cunning,\u201d he says.\n\nFind out who Australia's richest people are in the Financial Review Rich List 2019, out on Friday.", "description": "Today's property markets are presenting challenges for some but for these Rich Listers, opportunities abound.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2275%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_118/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3ed3c669f0c432bad22bc2cfc1c52f278b79cdb7", "published_at": "2019-04-18"}
