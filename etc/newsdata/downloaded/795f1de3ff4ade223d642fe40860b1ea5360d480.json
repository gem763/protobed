Previously, the Sao Paulo Court of Justice issued an injunction against the scheme after a user of the platform complained about delay withdrawals.\n\nWish Money revealed to be a scam\n\nOn Oct. 17, a series of audio recordings of the leaders and CEO of cryptocurrency investment company Wish Money revealed that company managers knew the firm was bankrupt and was a financial pyramid scam. The audio files were reportedly taken from a meeting between company leaders responsible for attracting new investors and Wish Money CEO Sabrina Victor. The Wish Money company has not paid any of its investors in weeks.\n\nAtlas Quantum denies videos are fake\n\nOn Oct. 13, Cointelegraph Brasil reported that the cryptocurrency platform and alleged pyramid scheme Atlas Quantum denied that videos with company balances at Gate.io and HitBTC are fake, even though the exchanges themselves claimed that they were forged.\n\nIn September, Atlas released a video showing balances on three exchanges, HitBTC, Gate.io and Poloniex, stating that the balances were blocked by Know Your Customer issues, saying:\n\n\"The video below shows our balance on nine accounts from three exchanges in which we operate.\u201d\n\nHowever, the exchange HitBTC came forward and said that the video was fake and that Atlas never had any locked accounts in the exchange. Gate.io similarly stated that the videos were forged and made to fool users. The Atlas press office has denied the exchanges\u2019 claims and reaffirmed the validity of the videos.\n\nThe allegedly forged videos surfaced after customers complained of delayed or halted withdrawals, which Atlas is now saying it will eventually pay out dues in reals, and that measures to redeem balances will be announced soon.\n\nAs previously reported, the firm\u2019s CEO Rodrigo Marques has fled the country with his family after a public hearing before the Brazilian House of Representatives.", "description": "Cointelegraph Brasil presents a weekly digest of selected cryptocurrency- and blockchain-related news", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOThmNTIxNjZlNzI4ZWNmNDZlN2QxZjAxMjkwZDRhZDguanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
