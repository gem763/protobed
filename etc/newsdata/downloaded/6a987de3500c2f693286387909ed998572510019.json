The service works much like the passenger app, but instead allows shippers to connect with carriers seeking freight.\n\nThe move to Canada comes after two years in the United States, where approximately 500,000 drivers from 50,000 carriers are signed up, and expansion to the Netherlands and Germany earlier this year.\n\nBill Driegert, head of operations for Uber Freight, said Uber\u2019s system helps smaller carriers that can struggle to find shippers in unfamiliar markets. For instance, a single trucker who moves a load from Toronto to Vancouver used to have to check a load board, essentially a classified listing, to try to find shippers and negotiate a price to avoid driving an empty truck back to Ontario.\n\n\u201cThat process is high friction, it takes time, is labour intensive,\u201d Driegert said. \u201cIt can take multiple calls to find one load.\u201d\n\nUber\u2019s app also presents shippers and carriers with a fixed price, with the option to see how much it will cost depending on the date.\n\n\u201cMost carriers and brokers don\u2019t want to haggle over every load,\u201d he said.\n\nUber, which has digitized the middle man and determines dynamic pricing with its technology, makes money by taking a cut of the price. Driegert would not disclose what percentage Uber takes or the financial details about the freight business.\n\nWhile the app experience mimics Uber\u2019s passenger business, there are key differences. Critically, not anyone can be a driver.\n\nAll drivers must have a commercial license and registration and appropriate equipment. Most come from companies that already exist.\n\nMost carriers and brokers don\u2019t want to haggle over every load\n\nNor do carriers and shippers publicly rate each other on the app. Carriers can evaluate shipping facilities, but they are not bound by the same star rating system as drivers in the passenger app.\n\nDriegert said it will boot a carrier that receives complaints, but it\u2019s goal is to keep carriers in the system. There is a driver shortage across North America, with the Canadian Transportation Agency predicting a shortage of 34,000 drivers by 2024.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough job and the existing workers are aging, Driegert said, so the app strives to make their jobs more efficient. If a truck is used more frequently for freight it improves the operating economics, and if a driver is making more money they\u2019re more likely to keep working, he added.\n\nWhile Uber isn\u2019t revealing how many Canadian drivers or shippers it has signed up for the launch, it named restaurant logistics service provider Martin Brower as a client.", "description": "Uber Freight's service works much like the passenger app, but instead allows shippers to connect with carriers seeking freight", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/uber-1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
