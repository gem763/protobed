There\u2019s a crystal-pendant-making workshop, a talk on the politics of body hair and another on mental health awareness. The most popular class to date, according to Jade Coles, the Collective\u2019s head of events and experiential marketing, was on how to make a ceramic dildo. \u201cThat one sold out in eight minutes,\u201d she says.\n\nThe 550 residents who call this building home pay a monthly rent starting at \u00a31,085 to live in rooms that are hotel-sized but which benefit from a number of communal amenities, like the events. There\u2019s a cinema room, a co-working space that converts into a music venue, another co-working space, a library that feels like a co-working space, a restaurant and a bar. There\u2019s no fee to join, and you can leave with one month\u2019s notice.\n\nBenjamin Webb, 37, has lived at the Collective for eight months and likes it enough that he is now a \u201ccommunity ambassador\u201d. He says co-living offered him a sense of freedom after two decades renting in London.\n\n\u201cI was looking for flexibility rather than being sucked into the cycle of letting agents, paying \u00a32,000 each time you move and being locked in a contract,\u201d says Webb, who works as a PA in the finance industry. \u201cThe Collective gave me that flexibility, but what kept me there \u2013 and I\u2019ve extended my original contract \u2013 is the community and all the other things that come with it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Collective doesn\u2019t market itself as apartments. It calls itself a \u201cglobal living movement\u201d, and is one of a growing number of \u201cco-living\u201d developments that cater to a distinctly millennial market.\n\nCo-living places are trying to squeeze every living space into the same building, which makes it unliveable long-term Vlad Calus, former Collective resident\n\nIn Berlin there is Quarters, a co-living developer that now has properties in New York and Chicago and has just announced a $300m expansion to build many more across the US and Europe. WeWork, the co-working behemoth, now runs WeLive: fully furnished apartments available for flexible rental in New York and Washington DC. The chic \u201cdigital nomad community\u201d Roam has set up co-living and co-working hubs in San Francisco, Miami, Tokyo and Bali (with a new location in London and another in New York coming soon). It sells a dream lifestyle, that of a modern, flexible, \u201ccreative\u201d worker who has bid farewell to the deskbound nine to five and instead jets around the world, dropping in to work remotely from exotic locations.\n\nEach company presents its accommodation as a solution to the urban housing crisis. Here, at last, is a way to provide affordable homes for younger people cut out of the market, while at the same time pooling resources, fostering community and catering for an increasingly mobile generation. With 4.8 million Britons now self-employed, co-living is pitched as a utopian response to a rapidly changing society.\n\nBut what from one angle looks like a revolutionary proposition can just as easily be seen from another as a cynical ploy by property developers to cash in on a generation living in the \u201cage of loneliness\u201d, locked in a perpetual struggle to find a place they can call home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A WeLive bedroom. Photograph: Courtesy of WeWork\n\nVlad Calus, 23, co-founder of social media startup Planable, sees it the second way. He moved into the Collective with a business partner two years ago. \u201cPeople were nice and friendly but we were shocked to see these \u2018boxes\u2019 being called rooms,\u201d he says. \u201cUnfortunately, co-living places are trying to squeeze every living space into the same building, which makes it unliveable for the long-term.\u201d\n\nCollective living has other downsides. Post-grad student Emma Kay, 32, who was among the first people to move in when the Collective opened three years ago, found herself unnerved by some of the ways the building operated, such as when she bought a drink from the bar and took it outside.\n\n\u201cThe next day I got an email saying they\u2019d seen me on CCTV with a glass in the smoking area and if I did it again there would be consequences,\u201d she says. \u201cIt felt quite uncomfortable knowing whatever you do is being watched, and if you break the rules for a minor offence you\u2019d get in trouble.\u201d\n\nCo-housing in its purest form is about communities being control of their housing Hannah Wheatley, housing researcher\n\nTo Matthew Stewart, a researcher and designer at the University of Westminster, co-living led by developers cannot be a radical alternative because it lacks the social intent of collective living. He points to bolder suggestions proposed by modernists almost a century ago to address the interwar housing shortage, such as the work of Karel Teige, a Czech theorist whose 1932 book The Minimum Dwelling proposed restructuring living space around community and collective domestic labour.\n\n\u201cThe Collective make similar claims about solving the housing crisis but it doesn\u2019t stand up,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cTeige was talking about a mixture of different ages, generations, classes \u2013 it wasn\u2019t targeted at a specific group. It was more about democratising housing, rather than just having these enclaves of millennials who are being charged a lot of money. \u201d\n\nYet the Collective is far from the only vision of what \u201cco-living\u201d might look like. Marmalade Lane, a 42-home multigenerational \u201coasis\u201d, was unveiled this May in Cambridge. A unique collaboration (between the K1 Cohousing Project and Cambridge city council, and delivered by developer Town, eco-house builder Trivselhus and architects Mole), Marmalade Lane was created through a participatory design process that involved its future residents.\n\nIt has a mix of homes, ranging from four-bedroom houses to one-bedroom apartments, with a central \u201ccommon house\u201d providing a focal point where the community can eat together and socialise. Everyone can also make use of communal laundry, gym, meeting rooms and garden, and the organisation is managed by its residents using consensus-based decision-making.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marmalade Lane has a central common house, where members of the community can eat and socialise, as well as other communal spaces such as a gym, laundry, meeting rooms and a garden.

The idea is to structure and organise housing in such as a way as to put communities, rather than developers, in the driving seat.\n\n\u201cCo-living is purely a new way for developers to squeeze profit from an already broken housing market,\u201d says Hannah Wheatley, researcher on housing and land at the New Economics Foundation.\n\n\u201cCo-housing in its purest form is about communities being control of their housing.\u201d\n\nIn Barnet, North London, the Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing project (Owch) has built a collection of 25 flats, all occupied by women older than 50. They are committed to participating in a community that shares space, resources and mutual support. As well as being an alternative to the existing home ownership model, Owch caters imaginatively for an ageing population, which is a growing need in many western cities.\n\nJosie Pearse, 64, shows it off with pride. There is a communal courtyard and an allotment, where a group of women are just getting ready to \u201cscatter some seeds\u201d. The women fought to have assured tenancies for the eight social tenants, of which Pearse is one. \u201cThere\u2019s power in this collective,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re kinda class warriors here.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The communal garden space at the Older Women\u2019s Co-Housing project in Barnet, north London. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian\n\nAlthough they were committed from the start to creating inclusive housing, the members of Owch were a relatively low-income group. The community was built with help from Hanover Housing Association, which found the site and funded the development, before selling it to 17 Owch buyers and Housing for Women, a charitable housing provider.\n\nMaria Brenton, one of the founding members of Owch and the woman who proposed the idea back in 1998, is critical of new developer-led co-living projects that use the same language of community and inclusion as the co-housing movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s misleading,\u201d says Brenton. \u201c[Co-living residents] don\u2019t have any say in how the place is run. It\u2019s like student digs: you move in, knock it about, then move on.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, demand for co-living remains high. The Collective has received $800m to fund growth across the UK, US and Europe and now has 8,000 units operating or under development. It has just opened what it claims is the world\u2019s biggest co-living development in Canary Wharf, with 705 rooms, a swimming pool on the 20th floor and a golf simulator. The smallest rooms are available from \u00a3100 a night (though a cursory glance at the booking system suggests rates are often \u00a3150 or more), \u00a31863pm for a three month stay and \u00a31430pm if you stay for 12 months. Its New York location (a converted hotel) is only available for short stays.\n\nThis focus on the higher end of the market might not be surprising given the Collective\u2019s CEO is Reza Merchant, a 29-year-old who was educated at the \u00a320,000-a-year Merchant Taylors\u2019 School and was able to launch the Collective after borrowing \u00a31.8m against his parent\u2019s home.\n\nDespite the lack of social tenancies or facilities for families, he maintains the Collective is a project rooted in providing community for average city dwellers.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The rooftop communal areas of the Quarters co-living development in Chicago. Photograph: Quarters\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very different to a conventional property developer,\u201d says Merchant, who has said his inspiration for the Collective draws on experiences at Burning Man festival. \u201cIf our driver was pure profit, we wouldn\u2019t be doing this. There are much easier ways to make money.\u201d\n\nYet even if its approach \u201cstems from a place of love\u201d, as Merchant claims, it\u2019s difficult to reconcile this service philosophy with the reality of what is on offer: a high price for short-term convenience.\n\nIf the Collective feels like accommodation, rather than a home, there may be a third way. Noiascape is another co-living developer that says it wants to sensitively use architecture and design to rethink the kind of \u201cshare house\u201d in which 1.1 million Londoners already live \u2013 most of them Victorian terraced houses, which were not designed for renting, let alone for large groups of people to subdivide into rooms.\n\nIt just felt like a hotel with rich students getting their accommodation paid for Emma Kay, former Collective resident\n\nBuilding on research showing that, other than for sleeping, private space in the home is used at very low intensity (particularly in the \u201cpre-family\u201d demographic), the company has designed 10 homes for 2-4 people in London in converted terraced houses. The flats are designed to cater for the modern renter. Decent joinery and inbuilt storage spares residents having to buy flat pack furniture, while the living spaces, which all flow into an outdoor area, are designed to encourage communal dining and social interaction, as well as providing flexible work space during the day. Double height ceilings maximise the sense of space and light.\n\nNoiascape\u2019s latest project, High Street House, will be a block of 10 self-contained studio flats built into an existing building, ranging from 25sqm to 37sqm with prices from \u00a3250 to \u00a3350 per week, including all bills and utilities. Another, which will accommodate 100-200 people, is in pre-planning. These properties will also contain shared spaces for events, exhibitions or working, and residents will be able to access any of these amenities across the Noiascape \u201cnetwork\u201d, no matter which property they live in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Noiascape latest co-living project, High Street House, centre. Photograph: http://noiascape.com\n\nDirector Tom Teatum disputes the view that the \u201cspace standard\u201d equates to quality. He argues that while coliving is easy to dismiss, it presents a \u201creal opportunity that\u2019s yet to be found\u201d. By creating a new housing topography that caters more efficiently for people who require less space, he suggests that those 1.1m Victorian houseshares could ultimately be released back into the market, to be used for the families for whom they were originally designed.\n\n\u201cIf we see a shared space \u2013 and a network of shared spaces \u2013 as being part of our rent - it transforms how you live,\u201d says Teatum. \u201cIt\u2019s a move away from the idea that your private space is the end of your living experience.\u201d\n\nHow to create happy communities through co-housing Read more\n\nThis re-balancing of private and shared space within our housing arrangements is at the essence of what might feel wonderful \u2013 or dreadful \u2013 when we make a choice about how we want to live. Back at Owch, Pearse, who previously lived in a property with no central heating and a coal fire, is showing off her bright, open living space decorated with colourful ornaments, watercolour sketchbooks stacked to one side. The balcony looks over the communal garden where neighbours can be seen chatting beside a sundial on the lawn.\n\n\u201cThe thing I love most about this place is coming home,\u201d she says.\n\nKay, on the other hand, moved out of the Collective after a year to move in with her boyfriend. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the communal experience I imagined,\u201d she said. \u201cCo-living might work in smaller set-ups but there it was too big for any real community. It just felt like a hotel with rich students getting their accommodation paid for.\u201d\n\nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter", "description": "With communal space and amenities all shared in what are sometimes vast complexes, co-living is billed as a solution to the housing crisis \u2013 but others say it\u2019s simply an attempt to cash in on it", "authors": ["Will Coldwell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/581a2797722fb41694bef0d79b5bc9b95b94ebad/0_234_3960_2376/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7bda80bb78cb8c9acab7f7c59bfeccc3"}
