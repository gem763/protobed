It\u2019s because rather than impose his Bible-thumping religion, with its commandment \u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d on Trump, he has let Trump corrupt him. A glance at Trivago would reveal numerous hotels smack dab in the middle of where Pence\u2019s meetings were taking place, and yet when Trump said, according to Pence\u2019s chief of staff Marc Short, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you stay at my place?\u201d he said yes.\n\nWhen I invite someone to stay at my place, even if they chip the wedding china and drink all the good wine during their visit, I don\u2019t bill them. But what \u201cstaying at my place\u201d means when it\u2019s Trump doing the inviting is that the taxpayer will pay dearly\u2014likely six figures for the whole entourage (a suite with ocean view, high-count thread sheets, in-floor heat, and bespoke decor goes for $1000 per night), and this isn\u2019t including the cost of the commute by helicopter or the bar tab.", "description": "For two-plus years, the fawning vice president merely made a fool of himself. But after he stayed at Trump\u2019s Ireland hotel, he\u2019s much worse than that.", "authors": ["Margaret Carlson"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567636147/190904-carlson-pence-tease_hqcfa1"}
