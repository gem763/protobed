U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down\n\n49 cents, or 0.9%, at $55.81.\n\nBrent is still set to register its fourth consecutive weekly\n\ngain while U.S. crude is on track for a second weekly rise.\n\nBeijing and Washington on Thursday agreed to hold high-level\n\ntalks in early October. The news cheered investors hoping for an\n\nend to a trade war that has brought tit-for-tat tariffs between\n\nthe world's two biggest economies, chipping away at economic\n\ngrowth. The prolonged dispute has had a dampening effect on oil\n\nprices, though they have risen over the year thanks partly to\n\nproduction cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum\n\nExporting Countries and Russia to drain inventories.\n\nHowever, analysts warn that market fundamentals remain\n\nbearish and depend heavily on a resolution to the U.S.-China\n\ntrade saga.\n\n\"If trade tensions escalate further, oil demand growth may\n\nsoften even more, requiring much lower prices,\" UBS oil analyst\n\nGiovanni Staunovo said in a note analysing oil market trends for\n\n2020.\n\n\"On the other hand, unexpected supply disruptions in the\n\nMiddle East or a surprise production cut by OPEC and its allies\n\nmay push oil prices higher.\"\n\nU.S. crude and product inventories fell last week, with\n\ncrude drawing down for a third consecutive week despite a jump\n\nin imports, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.\n\nEIA/S\n\nCrude stocks dropped 4.8 million barrels, nearly double\n\nanalyst expectations, to 423 million barrels, their lowest level\n\nsince October last year.\n\nOil prices on Thursday soared more than 2% after the EIA\n\nreport, though they gradually trimmed gains on investor doubts\n\nover the chances that the trade talks will yield results.\n\n\"There is still no getting away from lingering demand-side\n\nconcerns,\" said Stephen Brennock, of oil broker PVM.\n\n\"Consequently, any looming upside potential will be built on\n\nwobbly foundations so long as the U.S. and China continue to do\n\nbattle on the trade front.\"\n\nIn another sign of a possible global economic slowdown, data\n\nreleased on Friday showed German industrial output fell\n\nunexpectedly in July, putting Europe's biggest economy at risk\n\nof falling into recession in the third quarter. European markets slipped from one-month highs and the upbeat\n\nmood brought on by potential U.S.-China trade talks seemed to\n\nfade as markets awaited U.S. jobs data later on Friday.\n\nGRAPHIC: U.S. petroleum inventories https://tmsnrt.rs/2XlX17b\n\nTECHNICAL CHART: U.S. oil may test support at $55.74\n\nL3N25X0O2\n\nTECHNICAL CHART: Brent oil may hover below $61.54 L3N25X0B\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 3-Oil falls but remains set for weekly gain on U.S.-China diplomacy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
