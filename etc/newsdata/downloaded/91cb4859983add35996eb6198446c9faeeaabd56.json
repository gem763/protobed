Lenders\u2019 margins had also been hurt by increased switching from high margin interest-only loans to lower margin principal and interest loans.\n\nIt also said the remediation charges for \u201cincorrect [earlier] interest charges have also temporarily lowered net interest margins by a few basis points over the past year.\u201d\n\nThe Financial Stability Review, published every six months, seeks to identify risks posed to the Australian financial system, such as external shocks, household debt levels, and changing economic conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSydney risks remain\n\nThe report said that pricing of global financial markets appeared to be at odds with a \u201cmore uncertain growth outlook and vulnerabilities in the financial system.\u201d\n\nIt said that in Australia risks \u201cfrom falls in housing prices have reduced but still exist\" and pointed to high vacancy rates in Sydney and a potential oversupply of apartments as potentially leading to price falls.\n\nA change in lending standards, the Reserve Bank said, had led to an improvement in the asset quality of the banks and added it was important that banks were not overly cautious.\n\n\u201cLending always entails a degree of risk but excessive risk aversion by financial institutions can curtail the provision of credit that facilitates economic growth.\u201d", "description": "In its six-monthly Financial Stability Review, the Reserve Bank has pushed back against banks that have failed to pass on the full interest rate cuts.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2513%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/acd8b0344570fa6018dc80eb90a561230ba4cb9a", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
