Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who died last week after serving in Congress for decades.\n\nObama spoke during the funeral service for Cummings held at New Psalmist Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland. He recognized the congressman and civil rights champion for his dedication as a public servant, and for his genuine kindness.\n\nThe former president said that after listening to the eulogies delivered by Cummings\u2019 daughters earlier in the service, he reflected that he would want his own daughters to know that \u201cbeing a strong man includes being kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat there is nothing weak about kindness and compassion,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThere is nothing weak about looking out for others. There is nothing weak about being honorable. You are not a sucker to have integrity and to treat others with respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was sitting here and I was just noticing the Honorable Elijah E. Cummings and you know, this is a title that we confer on all kinds of people who get elected to public office,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to introduce them as honorable. But Elijah Cummings was honorable before he was elected to office. There\u2019s a difference. There is a difference if you are honorable and treated others honorably outside the limelight.\u201d\n\nChip Somodevilla via Getty Images Former President Barack Obama delivers remarks during the funeral service for Rep.

His parents and his faith planted the seeds of hope, and love, and compassion, and righteousness in that good soil of his.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has harvested all the crops that he could, for the Lord has now called Elijah home, to give his humble, faithful servant rest,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd it now falls on us to continue his work, so that other young boys and girls in Baltimore, across Maryland, across the United States, and around the world might too have a chance to grow and to flourish.
