I was just observing. As time wore on, I began to really get a sense of where he was at.\n\nThe row came as Meghan last night made an appearance at the official opening of the 2019 One Young World summit at London's Royal Albert Hall\n\n'I went intending to make a documentary that was always going to be about their work in Africa and then a little about where they are at in life.\n\n'I knew that everything wasn't entirely rosy behind the scenes. But all the same I had intended to turn up doing a more conventional, journalistic job, maybe beforehand I told them I was going to have to put some pretty pointed questions [to them].\n\n'The reality I found was just a couple that seemed a bit bruised and vulnerable - with mental health and all the rest of it you have to be careful what words you use \u2013 that was the story I found and it seemed the right journalistic thing to do to try and tell that story as empathetically as I could.'\n\nAsked what he hopes will come of the documentary, Mr Bradby says he 'hopes everyone will take a deep breath.'\n\nMeghan Markle was interviewed by Tom Bradby (pictured) for the ITV documentary on Sunday\n\nHe said: 'I kind of sense that in the end things weren't going in a very good direction here.\n\n'If this documentary has an outcome I do hope that it's that everyone \u2013 including them \u2013 takes a really deep breath and maybe thinks pretty hard about how the future may play out.'\n\nAsked about the different approaches taken by Harry and his brother, he added: 'It's quite interesting \u2013 William is taking a more traditional approach.\n\n'He has to - he's going to be King, he can't afford to alienate any constituency. Harry and Meghan have just decided to play things very differently.'\n\nDuring the documentary 'Harry & Meghan: An African Journey' aired on ITV on Sunday night, Prince Harry (pictured above) revealed his feelings about his royal duties\n\nYesterday, a source close to the couple said Harry and Meghan had 'single-handedly modernised the monarchy' \u2013 but courtiers are stoking up 'hysteria' against them.\n\nThe adviser accused the courtiers of being 'afraid of and inexperienced at how to best help harness and deploy the value' of the Duke and Duchess.\n\nAs the fallout over the royal couple's TV documentary took another remarkable twist, the source even suggested that palace insiders were hell-bent on stoking up 'anti-Prince Harry and Meghan hysteria'.\n\nThe incendiary claims, reported in a well-sourced story by US broadcaster CNN about the ITV programme, angered many in the wider royal household, where staff feel they have done their best to support the Sussexes in extremely 'trying' times.\n\nOne well-placed royal insider said: 'It's akin to saying that the Sussexes are too good for the Royal Family, which is extremely disrespectful to everyone who works for, and on behalf of, the Queen and other senior members of the Royal Family.\n\n'While not everyone agrees with what the duke and duchess have been saying, there has been immense sympathy that they find themselves in such a difficult place and people have been trying to help.'\n\nReferring to the documentary, the source said: 'Harry's clear anguish was incredibly raw and difficult to watch.\n\n'The truth is that no one is 'anti' Harry and Meghan and no one is briefing against them.\n\nMeghan opened about her struggles with the British Press in an hour-long ITV documentary with Tom Bradby and said friends had warned her over the difficulties she would face as a royal\n\n'And it is also just plain wrong to say they have single-handedly modernised the monarchy. Modernisation is an ongoing process led by Her Majesty the Queen.\n\n'No one has ownership of it. It is not a competition.\n\n'None of this is remotely helpful to the monarchy as an institution. It is promoting discord and taking attention away from the good work senior royals do across the board.'\n\nThe row came as Meghan last night made an appearance at the official opening of the 2019 One Young World (OYW) summit at London's Royal Albert Hall, described as a 'global forum for young leaders'.\n\nMeghan wore her hair down and an elegant purple dress as she attended the event without Harry, in her role as vice-president of the Queen's Commonwealth Trust.\n\nShe was welcomed on to the stage as 'a global champion for the rights of women and girls, activist and philanthropist' and embraced OYW co-founder Kate Robertson.\n\nIt was her first public appearance since the broadcast of Harry & Meghan: An African Journey.\n\nYesterday's online story by CNN's royal correspondent Max Foster quoted a 'senior royal source', close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, hitting out at the reaction to comments Prince Harry made about his brother in the documentary.\n\nBoth Prince Harry and his wife (pictured in South Africa on October 2) discussed the troubles that they have faced in the public eye since their wedding and becoming parents to Archie\n\nThe source also suggested parts of the media were turning 'brotherly concern from Prince William for Prince Harry into hysteria'.\n\nA royal source said in response to the ITV interview that William felt 'concerned' for his younger brother, 'as anyone would watching the documentary'.\n\nRoyal insiders told the Daily Mail they believe the comments to CNN highlight the level of 'paranoia' among Harry and Meghan's aides, or Team Sussex as they tend to call themselves.\n\n'It's very much a mentality of 'us against the world', which is a real shame,' said one insider.\n\n'The duke and duchess have much to offer and could be a formidable asset for the Royal Family. But they need to work as a team with the rest of the royal household and, rightly or wrongly, there is a lot of distrust right now.\n\n'There's also a startling lack of self-awareness about some of the problems they have experienced that have been of their own making, such as the row over their use of private jets. None of this is healthy \u2013 for anyone.'\n\nSources close to the couple are unapologetic about the furore caused by their documentary.\n\nAn aide said they thought it was 'sympathetic and balanced', and showed 'some of the real behind the scenes pressures' of a royal tour and their lives.", "description": "ITV News at Ten anchor Tom Bradby told ABC's Good Morning America that he 'had a couple of private heart to hearts' with Prince Harry ahead of filming the documentary.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/14/20084944-0-image-a-14_1571837681079.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
