Police also arrested a 39-year-old woman as part of the raid.\n\nThe investigation into the Sydney man and possible Philippines-based offenders was sparked after the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) referred the child abuse allegations to the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation in July 2019.\n\nLast month, police in New South Wales raided the man\u2019s home in Sydney\u2019s North Rocks, seizing electronic devices they allege contained child abuse material.\n\nThe 63-year-old is now facing charges including procuring a child to engage in sexual activity outside Australia, using a carriage service to solicit child pornography, transmitting child pornography material and possessing child abuse material.\n\nIt will be alleged that the man communicated with people offshore to procure the children \u2013 via a trusted adult \u2013 to produce and transmit child abuse material at his request, police said.\n\nHe is due to face Parramatta local court on 22 November.\n\nPolice did not rule out further arrests and said they expected to charge the woman detained at Rizal on Friday.\n\nThe girl has been placed in the care of the Philippines\u2019 Department of Social Welfare and Development.\n\nThe AFP\u2019s senior officer in Manila, federal agent Andrew Perkins, said: \u201cSadly there is an appetite for child abuse material online which leads to vulnerable children becoming pawns in a form of abuse that can have devastating impacts.\n\n\u201cThe arrest and rescue sends a strong message that, if you are taking part in this vile industry, law enforcement will find you.\u201d\n\nPolice urged anyone with information to report their suspicions through the Report Child Abuse link on the AFP website, via Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or their social media provider.", "description": "The 12-year-old\u2019s abuse was allegedly livestreamed on social media", "authors": ["Luke Henriques-Gomes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e901e030b553d33888fd9cca85d0af8ca50611e5/0_111_2310_1386/master/2310.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6eb2e2e7ce1665865dc52c168a54826e", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
