Rizzo gave a shout-out to D.C.'s newest champs during an interview with the Sports Junkies on 106.7 The Fan on Friday morning, and he said his team watched the Mystics beat the Sun on the flight from Los Angeles to St. Louis ahead of Game 1 of the NLCS.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe got lucky and got to watch the game on the airplane,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cThe whole airplane was tuned to the game. Mike did a great job with his staff on that team, another championship for the D.C. area. I couldn\u2019t be happier for those guys.\u201d\n\nNationals principal owner Mark Lerner wrote a letter congratulating the Mystics on their title.\n\n\u201cThe skill and grit shown by the players has been so inspiring,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCoach Mike Thibault is an impressive leader who deserves so much credit for what this team has been able to accomplish.\"\n\nThe District\u2019s previous major professional championship team to be honored at Nationals Park was the Capitals. Three days after winning the Stanley Cup in June 2018, Alex Ovechkin threw the ceremonial first pitch \u2014 two, in fact \u2014 as his teammates looked on. Players drank approximately all of the beer in a suite during the game before heading for the fountains in Georgetown to continue the celebration.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe entire Capitals team wore Nationals T-shirts on its most recent road trip, and several players have attended games during the Nationals\u2019 playoff run. Ovechkin threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 4 of the NLDS, in which his friend Ryan Zimmerman delivered the key home run.\n\n\u201cThe energy amongst the various teams in the city has been terrific,\u201d said Thibault, who was a guest along with his players on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Monday.\n\nBefore the Nationals opened the NLCS with a pair of wins in St. Louis, Thibault offered a prediction.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to be a double championship,\u201d he told Maloney on Friday. \u201cI think the Nats are going to go to the World Series.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nNow there\u2019s a chance the Mystics will be in attendance for the clincher.\n\nThe Nationals also announced that Parker Staples, a pediatric cancer patient, will throw the ceremonial first pitch before Monday\u2019s Game 3. Staples threw the ceremonial first pitch before Washington\u2019s win over the Marlins on May 24, which is when the team\u2019s season began to turn around after a 19-31 start. Legendary ring announcer Michael Buffer will introduce the starting lineups before Game 3.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The Nationals will honor the WNBA champion Mystics as they did the Stanley Cup champion Capitals a year ago.", "authors": ["Scott Allen", "Reporter Covering D.C.
