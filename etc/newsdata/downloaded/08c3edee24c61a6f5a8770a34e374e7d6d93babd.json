Former Editor-in-Chief of The Moscow News, he is author of the book, 'Midnight in the American Empire,' released in 2013.\n\nSocial justice warriors are up in arms over everything and anything these days, except for those issues that matter most to average Americans, like economic inequality, affordable healthcare, and even poverty.\n\nOnce upon a time in America, being a Democrat and a liberal actually meant something. It meant, as well as other things, advocating on behalf of economic outcasts who, for one reason or another, tumbled through the gaping cracks of a dog-eat-dog capitalist system that is not known for taking prisoners.\n\nIn his 1957 book \u2018America as a Civilization,\u2019 the late journalist Max Lerner described a liberal as someone who has \u201ca passion for battle \u2013 against the \u2018octopus\u2019 of the big corporations\u2026 for wage-and-hour legislation, for women\u2019s rights, for social security.\u201d\n\nThose days of true political activism are long gone.\n\nThe \u201cpassion for battle\u201d associated with liberals flickered to life for a brief, brave moment during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, where the battle cry \u201cWe are the 99 percent!\u201d put the one percent richest Americans on notice that the street was fed up with wage inequality and workplace abuses. That sudden groundswell of grassroots dissent, however, mysteriously vanished just as quickly as it arose. In its place, the liberals have embraced a radically progressive agenda that remains dangerously at odds with their traditional allegiances.\n\nAlso on rt.com I am a trans woman \u2013 but I think this woke world has gone too far\n\nToday, under the big tent of liberalism, every conceivable cause celebre is hoisted up for the social justice mob, who, like a pack of piranhas at lunchtime, engage in a weird, emotion-fueled contest where the winner is decided by who rants and raves the loudest. These are essentially narcissistic vanity games played out in full view of the global electronic coliseum known as social media. Orwell would certainly have appreciated these 15-minute hate sessions as proof of his prescience.\n\nTragically, these circus spectacles are happening at the very moment in American history when corporations \u2013 no longer under a minimal amount of democratic control by labor unions or government legislation as they were in the past - have achieved an unprecedented level of power and influence. The result has not gone unnoticed. Today, US wages remain stagnant, while tens of millions of Americans and their families struggle to survive at or below the poverty line. Yet the liberals remain oddly fixated on outrageous and unprecedented social and cultural experiments.\n\nLiberals lose the plot\n\nTake for example the spate of nervous hand-wringing over gender pronoun usage. This is one of those \u2018issues\u2019 that would not have become an issue unless a handful of radicals, in cooperation with a fawning lapdog media, insisted day and night that it was an issue. For the uninitiated, a gender neutral or gender inclusive pronoun is a pronoun, according to the LGBT Resource Center at the University of Wisconsin, \u201cwhich does not associate a gender with the individual who is being discussed.\u201d If you have no idea what that means, don\u2019t feel bad, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nNevertheless, this apparent fatal flaw in the language of King James \u2013 who, as one of those progenitors of oppressive white patriarchy (another liberal bogeyman), lacked the necessary foresight to anticipate future university gender courses \u2013 was duly fixed by the blessed \u2018woke\u2019 among us. Anyone who wishes to memorize the dozens of new pronouns that have been added to the English language, lest you be accosted by the campus police, may do so here.\n\nGender Neutral Pronouns: What they are & how to use them \ud83d\udc4c\n\n\n\nClick here to watch the full video \u27a1\ufe0f https://t.co/PjSEJChbwn#wetheinternettv#equalopportunityoffenders#genderpronounspic.twitter.com/LCWzJEb1dY \u2014 We the Internet TV (@WeTheInternetTV) July 18, 2019\n\nAnother example of modern liberalism gone stark-raving mad \u2013 mind you, there are literally hundreds of examples to choose from \u2013 is exemplified by the debate over gender-neutral toilets, itself a manifestation of the left\u2019s newfound obsessiveness with identity politics.\n\n\u201cThe battleground of the new progressivism is identity,\u201d writes George Packer, in a rare candid look at modern liberal tendencies, in the Atlantic. \u201cThat\u2019s the historical source of exclusion and injustice that demands redress.\u201d\n\nPacker went on to describe one particular \u201cbathroom crisis\u201d that hit his child\u2019s elementary school.\n\n\u201cA girl in second grade had switched to using male pronouns, adopted the initial Q as a first name, and began dressing in boys\u2019 clothes,\u201d Packer explained. \u201cQ also used the boys\u2019 bathroom, which led to problems with other boys.\u201d\n\nFollowing a meeting with the principal, the staff promised to find an acceptable solution.\n\n\u201cWithin two years,\u201d Packer said, \u201calmost every bathroom in the school\u2026 had become gender-neutral\".\n\n\"The Trump administration has ferociously attacked my community again.\" - @Caitlyn_Jennerhttps://t.co/N32or7NvbU \u2014 PAPER Magazine (@papermagazine) October 22, 2018\n\nIncredibly, all that work was the result of a single second-grader who somehow came to the conclusion that she was a boy. In my day, we called those girls \u2018tomboys,\u2019 and they played sports alongside the males and that was the end of the story. Today, some parents believe that such children \u2013 sometimes as young as seven- or eight-years-old \u2013 must be placed on the fast-track for \u2018gender transitioning.\u2019\n\nThe main question, however, is what exactly went wrong with liberalism? Why does it give so much attention to PC issues at the same time that thousands of impoverished Americans, camped out in urban areas, barely registers a blip on their ultra-sensitive radar.\n\n\n\nSeattle is trying to figure out how to clean poop off their streets but A Democrat Councilman doesn\u2019t like the idea of using a pressure washer hose because it reminds him of hoses used against civil rights activists...\n\n\n\nYou can\u2019t make this stuff up. Insane.https://t.co/fxqdvmRYa2 \u2014 Robby Starbuck (@robbystarbuck) August 27, 2019\n\nIn California, the hedonistic capital of the free and libertine, residents are lashing out against thousands of homeless people who have erected tent cities across the state. That is certainly ironic, especially considering that California has extended protections to immigrants who enter the United States illegally.\n\nThe New York Times described how some neighborhoods are grappling with the situation: \u201cResidents of a street in San Francisco recently installed boulders on the sidewalk to deter people from erecting tents and sleeping there. In Los Angeles, homeowners have installed prickly plants for the same purpose.\u201d Does that sound like the liberal way?\n\nOnce again, it\u2019s hard not to notice the stark dichotomy between the liberal reaction to a single \u2018transgender boy\u2019 and how his school district went out of its way to help him use the toilet of his choice, and that of thousands of homeless people on the streets of San Francisco who would be grateful just for a warm place to sleep at night.\n\nHave the liberals become reluctant about assisting the needy and homeless because the cause does not carry the whiff of profit? That may not be so cynical a reason as it may first sound. After all, many people \u2013 and not least of all executives of pharmaceutical companies \u2013 stand to gain a fortune from transgender cases, for example, which force patients into a lifelong relationship with the medical industry. Homelessness, on the other hand, only exacts a tremendous burden on the public purse. That could just be the unspoken reason so few \u2018social justice warriors\u2019 pontificate on the poverty issue. It just doesn\u2019t have the same \u2018optics\u2019 as other burning issues do.\n\nImagine the tremendous change liberals could make if they, once again, devoted the same amount of passion and energy into fighting for the wellbeing of the poor and marginalized as they do over PC-related issues. I dare say America\u2019s increasingly squalid streets would live up to its superpower status. After all, a country is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\nIt\u2019s time the liberals come to grips with the real issues affecting the greatest number of Americans, like poverty and inequality, instead of paying lip service to issues that have been overhyped and sensationalized by the media on behalf of an infinitesimal fraction of the population, and not least of all the corporations.\n\nAmerican voters \u2013 even the poor ones \u2013 deserve much better.\n\n@Robert_Bridge\n\nLike this story?
