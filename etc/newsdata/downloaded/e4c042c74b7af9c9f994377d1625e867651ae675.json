(Joshua Roberts/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has announced that he will not comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony and documents related to his Ukraine dealings. He delivered the news during an ABC News interview conducted Tuesday, the compliance deadline prescribed by House Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf they enforce it then we will see what happens,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani also said he has dismissed Jon Sale, who he recently hired to represent him during impeachment proceedings. He said he will retain new counsel if the House enforces the subpoena.\n\nHouse Democrats initially subpoenaed Giuliani last month, and gave him a deadline of October 15 to comply with the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cYour failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the president or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the president,\u201d the September 30 letter reads.\n\nGiuliani told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos during an interview on September 29 that he would only consider complying with the House inquiry if President Trump directed him to.\n\n\u201cIf he decides that he wants me to testify, of course I\u2019ll testify, even though I think Adam Schiff is an illegitimate chairman. He has already prejudged the case,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nAs a last act, Sale sent a letter to the House on Giuliani\u2019s behalf to formally respond to the subpoena, stating that \u201cthe subpoena is overbroad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry.\u201d", "description": "President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani has announced that he will not comply with a congressional subpoena for testimony and documents related to his Ukraine dealings.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
