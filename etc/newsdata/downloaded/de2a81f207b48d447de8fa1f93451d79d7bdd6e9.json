The round was led by Luge Capital and also saw participation from WhiteStar Capital. Luge will be taking a board seat while Whitestar will be taking an observer seat at Flare.\n\n\u201cSensitive internal and customer data is growing massively and hacking techniques to steal that data are becoming increasingly sophisticated,\u201d said David Nault, co-founder and general partner of Luge Capital. \u201cThere is a critical need in the market for Flare Systems\u2019 solutions that help financial institutions and other organizations protect their data from cybercriminals. Flare Systems\u2019 powerful combination of cybersecurity tools give a holistic view on the cyber attack chain and enables collaboration between cybersecurity, fraud, and compliance teams.\u201d\n\nFlare\u2019s products take data from darknet sources such as broadcasts of stolen information, private forum discussions, chat posts, and cryptocurrency transactions, and combine it with world-class proven research in criminology insights, then providing that to financial crime teams. The startup wants to take a holistic approach to the complete attack chain with tools that prevent and mitigate attacks on each link in the communication chain of criminals. It does this by automatically structuring, organizing, and normalizing millions of data points from multiple sources.\n\nThe company was co-founded in 2017 by CEO Mathieu Lavoie, CTO Isra\u00ebl Hall\u00e9, CRO David He\u0301tu, and Yohan Tr\u00e9panier Montpetit, who is vice president of product. Before launching Flare Systems, Lavoie managed a security penetration team at Desjardins, where he learned the cybersecurity challenges faced by financial institutions. He\u0301tu holds a PhD in criminology from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, focusing most of his research on identifying patterns of communication in illicit markets on the internet. He\u0301tu has published over 40 articles in the last decade on the structure and inner workings of such markets.\n\nAfter coming together to create Flare, He\u0301tu and Lavoie then contacted Hall\u00e9, who was working for Google at the time and knew Lavoie through a cybersecurity competition. Hall\u00e9 was also looking to join a startup and the problem Flare was looking to tackle resonated with him. A year after, before the startup achieved any sales, Montpetit joined the team as its last co-founder. Montpetit had experience in developing software solutions using big data while managing teams and acting as a product owner.\n\nDuring the NextAI accelerator, the team met Aamna Zia, who was also part of the accelerator. Lavoie told BetaKit Zia\u2019s strong expertise in business strategy, international expansion, and mergers and acquisitions was a good fit for the team. She officially joined last April as head of growth.\n\n\u201cWe decided to develop Flare Systems after working in the industry and felt that the evolving threat landscape for financial crime not only requires insight and knowledge of how an organization is being targeted, but also the tools to bridge those insights within the functional areas of the business,\u201d\u200b said Lavoie. \u200b\u201cToday we are providing some of the deepest intelligence available on the market.\u201d\n\nAlthough the startup\u2019s clients\u2019 names remain confidential, the startup confirmed with BetaKit that it currently has seven recurring clients and three financial institutions as either a client or proof of concept. As part of its growth strategy, Flare Systems is also partnering with security service providers in Canada, the US, and Europe to include its offering in their basket of services.\n\nRELATED: Ryerson University cybersecurity hub receives $30 million in public, private investments\n\nIn order to expand to Europe, Lavoie said the company is trying to establish itself as a knowledge leader to establish rapport with other cybersecurity teams. The team recently spoke at various events in France and has a proof of concept underway with a bank in Luxembourg. The company wants to take a multi-channel strategy for the European market and is in the process of forging partnerships with managed security service providers to accelerate its expansion in Europe.\n\n\u201cWe are very grateful for having such experienced investors that have a vast network within the financial sector,\u201d Lavoie told BetaKit. \u201cTheir presence within our board and company will help us with our future endeavours.\u201d\n\nCybersecurity has been heating up this year in Canada, with a number of enterprise companies and financial institutions taking the issue more seriously as data breaches become increasingly common. Last month, Ernst & Young acquired cybersecurity startup ElevatedPrompt Solutions, while the Canadian Internet Registration Authority has partnered with Atlantic Canada startup Beauceron Security to launch a cybersecurity platform.\n\nThe government has also been ramping up efforts to usher in a new era of heightened cybersecurity. The National Research Centre of Canada launched a cybersecurity and IoT hub in Kitchener-Waterloo, and the federal government created CyberSecure Canada, a training initiative for SMBs. Over the past year, the data of 19 million Canadians was compromised after over 400 breaches were reported to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.\n\nFlare said a cyberattack takes place every 39 seconds, and the frequency and sophistication of these attacks are increasing. With the growing requirement for more resources and insights from businesses of all sizes, Flare is hoping its technology will help meet the market demand.\n\nImage courtesy Flare Systems", "description": "Flare Systems, a Montreal-based cybersecurity startup that helps financial institutions security threats, has closed a $1 million seed round.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/flare-1024x743.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
