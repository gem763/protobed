The clip was shared on Twitter.\n\nMany people on the podcast's Facebook group and in Instagram comments urged the women to apologize, according to Buzzfeed News.\n\nJackie then posted a long Facebook comment saying that some of the \"inferences\" people were making about her words were \"wild.\"\n\n\"If that's really what you think I meant and what you think of me, that's upsetting,\" she wrote. \"Overall, I was just saying I've been feeling safer in movie theaters (a place that for a long time I didn't feel safe in because of all the horrible tragedies) because why would a shooter pay $30 for a movie when they can pay $15. That's it.\"\n\nShe admitted it was harsh, but claimed that the point of the show is to be \"honest about our feelings and innermost thoughts.\"\n\n\"We toe the line of PC [politically correct] culture in a way that feels natural to us but we don't filter everything we say, because that's not who we are and you can watch a different show for that experience,\" she said. \"I'm sorry to anyone who was hurt by what I said because that is never my intention but damn, some of you are quick to assume the absolute worst in me.\"\n\nRead more: Joaquin Phoenix walked out of an interview after a critic asked him whether 'Joker' would inspire mass shooters\n\nJackie addressed the comments again in Wednesday's episode of \"The Morning Toast,\" and also told Tanya Chen at Buzzfeed News she would not be apologizing.\n\n\"Yesterday I offended some people on this show about movie theaters,\" she said on the episode. \"There was a lot of talk about it.

YouTube\n\nIn March 2018, Jackie and Claudia were revealed to be the daughters of anti-Muslim Breitbart columnist and conspiracy theorist Pamela Geller. A report by Taylor Lorenz in The Daily Beast said that the sisters had tried to cover up the fact they were related to Geller by cropping her out of photos.\n\n\"None of the Oshry sisters have given a hint that they're embarrassed by their mother's views,\" wrote Lorenz. \"They have either stayed silent on political issues, or, in some cases, given hints that they are at least somewhat in line with their mother politically.\"\n\nAfter the article was published, the Oshry sisters harassed her and encouraged their followers to doxx her, she said.\n\n\"It's up to their own community to hold them accountable,\" Lorenz tweeted. \"I've pointed out numerous times (in articles and on here) their sustained history of racist, Islamophobic, and insensitive comments. It's no surprise to me or anyone paying attention that they're still doing it.\"\n\nIn August, Claudia denied the claims on Twitter.\n\n\"I have never uttered this person's name publicly, let alone encouraged harassment, doxxing, firing, etc,\" she said. \"I am not responsible for the posts of other people in a Facebook group that I did not own nor operate. Nor am I responsible for what strangers on the Internet tweet.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nA group of Insta-famous sisters are facing major backlash after the world learned their mom is a famous anti-Muslim activist\n\nPeople are calling an 18-year-old YouTuber 'privileged' and 'entitled' for saying her trip to Greece was 'not fun'\n\nA man saw his photo being used at an anti-vaxxer vigil for dead children even though he's still very much alive\n\nNobody knew YouTuber Danielle Cohn's real age until her own father said she's only 13.
