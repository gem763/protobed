Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts who are driving hyperpartisan agendas.\n\n\u201cThis is not just about who has the best policy \u2014 although of course, I believe my policy plans are the right ones for America,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said Wednesday on CNN. \u201cThis is going to be about who is going to be able to pick up the pieces and move the country forward after the Trump presidency comes to an end.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg said the party should be concerned about getting sucked into purity tests at the expense of pursuing policies that could get written into law.\n\n\u201cWhen we know that by the time the Trump presidency ends, one way or the other, we\u2019re going to be even more divided, even more polarized, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means being able to fight is not enough. We\u2019ve got to be able to unite as well.\u201d\n\nSince making a big splash early on in the race, Mr. Buttigieg has focused on raising money and building out his ground game in the early primary states.\n\nHe has positioned himself as the best moderate alternative to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who has faded in the polls and seemed like an afterthought in Tuesday\u2019s debate.\n\nThe approach is starting to pay off in Iowa.\n\nMr. Buttigieg is sitting at 12% in the Real Clear Politics average of Iowa polls, putting him within striking distance of Ms. Warren at 23%, Mr. Biden at 19% and Mr. Sanders at 16%.\n\nDavid Yepsen, a former Des Moines Register political reporter who covered the Iowa caucuses for decades, said Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s performance Tuesday should help him solidify his support.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always performed better than the early polls were showing,\u201d Mr. Yepsen said. \u201cThe race is starting to take shape, and he\u2019s got a good, smart campaign. He\u2019s always attracted good crowds, particularly of younger people. He\u2019s got an excellent ground organization.\u201d\n\nMr. Buttigieg, who is openly gay, still has his work cut out for him \u2014 particularly with black voters, who have been slow to warm to him and who make up the majority of the Democratic primary electorate in South Carolina, the third contest in the primary race.\n\nHe is banking on the idea that Obama-like breakthroughs in the Iowa caucuses could change that political dynamic.\n\nThe mayor has decided that going after Mr. Biden is not the best way to seize the more conventional liberal lane, but by distancing himself from Ms. Warren and the far-left proposals of other rivals.\n\n\u201cWith Bernie and Elizabeth fighting it out for the left-hand lane, the centrist lane is a bit more crowded,\u201d Mr. Yepsen said. \u201cBut if Biden continues to fade in the center, Mayor Pete will have some appeal.\u201d\n\nHis message also is resonating with some Republicans.\n\nMr. Buttigieg is calling out Ms. Warren for refusing to say \u2014 unlike Mr. Sanders \u2014 that taxes will be raised to pay for a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system and suggesting the far-left vision that is powering her campaign can appear divisive to middle-of-the-road voters.\n\n\u201cNot only is it important to have yes or no answers to yes or no questions at a time when people are so frustrated with Washington-speak, but also there\u2019s still been no explanation for a multitrillion-dollar hole in this plan,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Sen. Warren, but last night she was more specific and forthcoming about the number of selfies she\u2019s taken than about how this plan is going to be funded. And that\u2019s a real problem, especially when there\u2019s a better way to deliver health care coverage to everybody.\u201d\n\nLis Smith, a senior Butitgieg adviser, said the campaign was getting a post-debate bounce.\n\n\u201cBetween website traffic and small-dollar contributions, this is one of the biggest days of this campaign,\u201d she said in a Twitter post.\n\nBryce Smith, chairman of the Dallas County Democrats in Iowa, said Mr. Buttigieg is likely siphoning support away from Mr. Biden.\n\n\u201cI think for every drop in Biden, it is a gain in Buttigieg,\u201d Mr. Smith said. \u201cPete is more progressive on issues because of his age and what he has lived through. But I\u2019d also say that if you put Joe Biden in a 38-year-old body in today\u2019s world it would be very much like Pete Buttigieg.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s bid is stirring up memories of Barack Obama\u2019s rise in the 2008 Democratic primary race.\n\n\u201cPeople draw a lot of commonalities between Barack Obama circa 2007 and Peter Buttigieg in 2019 \u2014 not just because of their age and newness to politics, but in general the way they try to build up momentum and the promise of hope and change and a different future,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that resonates with a lot of Iowans.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
