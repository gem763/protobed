(NASA Photo / Bill Ingalls)\n\nNASA confirmed today that Boeing is scheduled to conduct the next high-profile test of its CST-100 Starliner space capsule in a little more than three weeks.\n\nThe target data for Starliner\u2019s pad abort test is set for Nov. 4 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, NASA said. That\u2019s in line with the plan that Boeing executive John Mulholland laid out earlier this week at a New Mexico space symposium.\n\nIf next month\u2019s test is successful, Boeing would target Dec. 17 for the launch of an uncrewed Starliner to the International Space Station from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket.\n\nAnd if that test flight is successful in turn, Boeing is expected to send a crew of spacefliers on a demonstration flight to the space station in early 2020. That\u2019s roughly the same timetable that SpaceX is working toward for the first crewed flight of its Crew Dragon space taxi.\n\nSpaceX and Boeing are developing the spaceships under the terms of multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA. Boeing\u2019s Starliner and SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon are designed to accommodate as many as seven astronauts for trips to and from the space station, restoring a U.S. crewed launch capability that was lost in 2011 when NASA retired the space shuttle fleet.\n\nNASA is currently paying Russia\u2019s space agency more than $80 million a seat for trips on Russian Soyuz spacecraft.\n\nBoeing\u2019s pad abort test involves having an uncrewed Starliner spacecraft fire its launch abort engines to blast off from a test pad, rise about a mile in the air and make a landing about a mile away with the aid of parachutes and airbags.\n\nSuch a scenario would come into play during an actual mission if a launch-pad emergency required the crew and its capsule to rocket to safety.\n\nMore than a year ago, Boeing was dealt a significant setback when a test of the launch abort system went awry due to an unwanted leak of propellant. The problem led to months of delay, but the launch abort engines passed a similar test this May.\n\nThe crew for next year\u2019s Starliner demonstration flight consists of NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Nicole Mann, plus Boeing test pilot Chris Ferguson.\n\nFerguson came to Boeing from NASA\u2019s astronaut corps, where he served as commander of the shuttle fleet\u2019s final flight in July 2011. During that mission, he and his crewmates left behind a small American flag that\u2019s destined to be retrieved and returned to Earth by the next crew to be launched from U.S. soil.\n\nNow Ferguson is hoping to be part of the team doing the retrieval. \u201cSort of like a grown-up version of \u2018capture the flag,\u2019 \u201d he told Reuters in August.\n\nMore from GeekWire:", "description": "NASA confirmed today that Boeing is scheduled to conduct the next high-profile test of its CST-100 Starliner space capsule in a little more than three weeks.
