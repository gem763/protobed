The Fed is now having to supply cash to fix the plumbing in a process that looks eerily similar to QE.\n\nStrategists who have spoken with Fed officials are expecting the central bank to unveil a $300 billion\u2013$500 billion standing credit line to the market at its meeting next month, in order to provide consistent liquidity and keep the market functioning.\n\nThe bottom line: \"What the Fed is trying to do is make sure we don\u2019t have episodes like this in the future,\" said Ian Lyngen, the head U.S. rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets, a primary dealer that does business directly with the Fed.", "description": "Things are getting worse, not better, in the systemically important repo market that banks use to access cash.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/M_5EHe7c7Lnn4Awt2yDZfFZtZRs=/0x0:1303x733/1920x1080/2019/09/26/1569509376530.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
