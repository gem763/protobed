He also proposed $50 billion in workforce training, community-college business partnerships and apprenticeships.\n\nThe proposal would also reduce student loan debt for those who work public service jobs, such as teachers or serving in the military. Biden\u2019s plan would waive up to $10,000 per year of student loans for up to five years.\n\nThe plan stops short of more expensive and farther-reaching proposals of other Democratic challengers, like the four years of free tuition proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nBiden\u2019s vision increases access to higher education for low-income students, minorities and undocumented migrants under the DACA program. It also includes bigger Pell Grants and new money for historically black colleges and universities.\n\nBiden\u2019s wife, Jill, is a longtime community college professor in northern Virginia.\n\n\u201cMy students inspire me,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThey\u2019re single parents and veterans. They juggle multiple jobs and care for their families. Many of them are first-generation college students.\n\n\u201cThey work so hard and ask for only one thing in return: Opportunity. And every American deserves that.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 8 (UPI) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden unveiled a plan Tuesday that would allow Americans two no-tuition years of community", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
