(Photo by Tim Warner/Getty Images)\n\nLed by a strong performance by 20-year-old Juan Soto that included a game-tying home run, a double and a single, the Washington Nationals squeaked by the Houston Astros in Game 1 of the World Series last night, winning 5-4 and giving Astros starter Gerrit Cole his first loss in five months.\n\nSoto drove in three of the Nationals\u2019 five runs, and he became just the fourth player in MLB history to hit a home run in the World Series before his 21st birthday, joining Miguel Cabrera, Andruw Jones and Mickey Mantle. The 417-foot blast also makes him the second-youngest hitter of all time to homer in his first World Series game. (Andruw Jones was 19 when he homered in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series.)\n\n\u201cAfter the first at-bat, I just said, \u2018It\u2019s another baseball game,'\u201d Soto said after the game. \u201cIn the first at-bat, I\u2019m not going to lie, I was a little bit shaking in my legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got kind of the \u2018it\u2019 factor,\u201d Houston manager AJ Hinch said of Soto. \u201cHe\u2019s got the twitch. He\u2019s got fast hands. He\u2019s got no fear. I think that\u2019s really big for a young hitter early in his career to just kind of leave it out there. It looks like he\u2019s completely in control of enjoying the moment, and he hit all sorts of different pitches.\u201d\n\nThis is Juan Soto's first #WorldSeries game.
