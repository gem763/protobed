The rocket flew approximately 450 kilometers (280 miles) before landing in the East Sea, according to the JCS.In a press briefing at 7:58 a.m., Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga claimed that two ballistic missiles had been fired, with one landing near the North Korean coast and the other in waters in the East Sea that were within Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone near the island of Dogojima in the Shimane Prefecture.Hours later, however, after South Korea\u2019s Ministry of National Defense announced at 10:29 a.m. that it only detected one SLBM launch, Suga appeared to retract his government\u2019s earlier assessment, saying at 11:35 a.m. that \u201cone ballistic missile may have split off into two as it landed.\u201dAccording to the South Korean official, Seoul\u2019s military had already detected signs of a North Korean missile test a day earlier and had been closely monitoring the launch site near Wonsan since Oct. 1.The intelligence sharing on the SLBM launch was the ninth time South Korea and Japan put Gsomia into effect after North Korean weapons tests this year, and the first time Seoul took the initiative to do so. As a result of Japan\u2019s economic retaliations toward South Korea over the issue of wartime forced labor, Seoul announced in August it will not renew Gsomia after it expires on Nov. 22.Saying Seoul would continue to faithfully exercise the agreement upon Tokyo\u2019s request until its end on Nov. 22, another South Korean government source said the rationale behind this month\u2019s intel-sharing on the North\u2019s weapons test \u201cwas to rectify a prevalent notion in the Japanese government that our [South Korea\u2019s] intelligence was of low-value.\u201dThere was, however, no acknowledgement from Japan on the importance of South Korean military intelligence. During an upper house session at the country\u2019s parliament on Oct. 9, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe dismissed the implication that a lack of bilateral cooperation with Seoul led to an erroneous initial assessment on the SLBM launch, saying that the end of Gsomia \u201cdoes not have a direct effect on the security of Japan.\u201dBY LEE CHUL-JAE [shim.kyuseok@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
