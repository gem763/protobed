Covers checks in on the opening odds and early action for four games.\n\nNo. 10 Auburn Tigers at No. 3 Louisiana State Tigers (-11.5)\n\nIt\u2019s a battle of two Tigers, with Louisiana State holding the upper hand heading into this Saturday afternoon Southeastern Conference clash. LSU (7-0 SU, 5-2 ATS) has won all its games by at least 14 points, including a 36-13 victory at Mississippi State as 17.5-point favorites in Week 8.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAuburn hit a speed bump at Florida in Week 6, losing 24-13 as 2.5-point favorites, so it can ill afford another loss. Auburn (6-1 SU and ATS) had a bye in Week 7, then pounded Arkansas 51-10 as 20.5-point road faves last weekend.\n\nEarly bettors seem to like the Bayou Bengals better, as the number quickly moved to LSU -12.\n\n\u201cLSU continues to be a runaway train, and despite Auburn boasting a pretty strong resume, the public is continuing to ride LSU,\u201d Chaprales said. \u201cThe number has already moved in LSU\u2019s direction. While it remains to be seen how high the action will drive it, we\u2019ll be needing Auburn one way or another.\u201d\n\nNo. 13 Wisconsin Badgers at No. 4 Ohio State Buckeyes (-14)\n\nWisconsin was certainly a part of the CFP conversation until Week 8, when it suffered one of the season\u2019s most stunning losses. The Badgers (6-1 SU, 5-2 ATS) went to Illinois as 28.5-point favorites, led 20-7 early in the third quarter, then tumbled outright 24-23 on a field goal in the final seconds.\n\nOhio State has been just fine on the field and against the oddsmakers, going 7-0 SU and 6-1 ATS, cashing the last six games. The Buckeyes boatraced Northwestern 52-3 in a Week 8 Friday nighter, easily covering as hefty 26.5-point road favorites.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cThis matchup was obviously looking quite a bit more enticing before Saturday, but Ohio State was going to open as big favorites regardless of Wisconsin\u2019s result,\u201d Chaprales said. \u201cThe first few tickets have been on the Buckeyes laying the two touchdowns.\u201d\n\nNo. 7 Notre Dame Fighting Irish at No. 20 Michigan Wolverines (-2.5)\n\nNotre Dame could still have a place at the CFP table, but another loss would certainly wipe out any hopes of making the four-team field. The Fighting Irish (5-1 SU, 4-2 ATS), whose only setback was at Georgia, edged Southern California 30-27 laying 10.5 points at home in Week 7. Brian Kelly\u2019s squad had a bye in Week 8.\n\nMichigan\u2019s goose is already cooked as it relates to the CFP, with two losses already and Ohio State looming at season\u2019s end. In Week 8 at Penn State, the Wolverines (5-2 SU, 3-4 ATS) rallied from a 21-0 deficit, falling short on a late fourth-and-goal from the 3-yard line in a 28-21 loss catching 7.5 points.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame\u2019s tight loss to Georgia a few weeks ago is suddenly not looking as impressive, while Michigan\u2019s slim playoff hopes were officially extinguished by Penn State,\u201d Chaprales said. \u201cEarly action has landed on the Irish, resulting in an adjustment down to Michigan -1.5.\u201d\n\nThe Wolverines dipped to -1 by Monday afternoon.\n\nWashington State Cougars at No. 11 Oregon Ducks (-13.5)\n\nOregon remains the Pac-12\u2019s best-though-unlikely hope for a CFP bid, with its lone loss coming to Auburn in a Week 1 neutral-site contest. The Ducks (6-1 SU, 4-3 ATS) rallied from a 28-14 third-quarter deficit at Washington to nab a 35-31 win and cover as 3-point favorites Saturday.\n\nWashington State had higher expectations for this season, but a three-game skid \u2013 starting with a 67-63 home loss to UCLA after leading 49-17 as 18-point chalk \u2013 squelched those hopes. The Cougars (4-3 SU, 2-5 ATS) got back on track in Week 8 against Colorado with a 41-10 home rout giving 13.5 points.\n\n\u201cThis one looks pretty cut and dried \u2013 Oregon or pass for the public,\u201d Chaprales said. \u201cWe went up with 13.5, but it probably won\u2019t take much for it to move to 14.\u201d\n\nIn fact, by Monday afternoon, PointsBet moved the line to Ducks -14.\n\nPatrick Everson is a Las Vegas-based senior writer for Covers.com.
