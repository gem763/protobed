(angela n./Flickr)\n\nIt was a cool day as clouds and a north wind helped keep temperatures a few degrees below average. We keep a similar story going tonight and into tomorrow. The chance of rain is up, as well, which is certainly good news when it comes to drought conditions in the region.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough Tonight: Showers become more likely near and after sunset. Most should be light, although there\u2019s some chance of organized activity as we get deeper into the night. If so, we are talking a tenth of an inch or so of rain, and perhaps a few spots with a bit more. Lows are mainly in the low to mid-50s. Winds are out of the north-northeast around 5 to 10 mph.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Wednesday): Showers may persist into and through the morning before tending to end as we head into the afternoon. They will help keep things cool, as highs rise to near 60 in the cool spots and the mid-60s in the warm ones. Winds continue to blow from the north and northeast around 10 mph.\n\nSee Matt Rogers\u2019s forecast through the weekend.

Other allergens are low.\n\nCooling down: It might have felt extra cool today, but it wasn\u2019t far below the normal high of 71 for the date. All that warm weather of late might have our bodies a little bit confused! Our average high moves to 70 degrees on Thursday and 65 on Oct. 26. We\u2019ve even got low temperatures entering the 40s on average soon. And watch out: 49 arrives Oct. 19. Winter is coming.\n\nWant our 5 a.m. forecast delivered to your email inbox?
