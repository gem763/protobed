The opposition has alleged fraud and Morales has accused rivals of staging a \"coup.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's John Holman, reporting from La Paz, said that Thursday saw the largest anti-government protests since polling day.\n\n\"They [protesters] feel that there were irregularities in that vote,\" he said, adding that sentiments towards Morales started to turn sour as early as two years ago when he lost a referendum to extend term limits on the presidency.\n\n\"He lost that referendum and he decided to run anyway. And I think from there, things have started to turn more sour.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Bolivia's electoral board said 0.01 percent votes were voided in the region of Beni with new voting there scheduled for November.\n\nShe added those votes were not enough to change the outcome. The president of the electoral office in Beni said a little over 500 people will vote again due to the annulments.\n\nWith the official result, Morales, already Latin America's longest-serving president, wins a fourth term in a row, allowing him to govern the landlocked South American country until 2025 - a total of 19 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States, Brazil, Argentina and Colombia joined in calling for Bolivia to hold a runoff between the incumbent and his top challenger.\n\nAnti-government protesters march on Thursday demanding a second-round presidential election [Juan Karita/AP]\n\nA communique issued by Colombia's foreign ministry on behalf of the three other countries said the governments of the four nations \"will only recognise results that reflect the will of the Bolivian people.\"\n\nUnited opposition\n\nThe European Union took a similar stand, saying it backed a call by the Organization of American States for a second-round election, saying that could help Bolivia regain its footing after days of sometimes violent protests by angry opposition supporters.\n\n\"The European Union shares the OAS' assessment that the best option would be to make a runoff to restore trust and ensure full respect for the democratic elections of the Bolivian people,\" the EU said in a statement that also called for the parties to refrain from further violence.\n\nOpposition leaders were also united in rejecting Morales' claim of victory even as the president's supporters were out celebrating.\n\nAnalysts have said a united opposition might stand a chance in a second round of defeating Morales, a leftist former coca-growers union leader who has governed the Andean nation for 14 years.\n\nFlanked by other opposition leaders, Mesa read a statement calling for \"citizens and social groups to remain peacefully mobilised until they obtain respect for the will of the people.\"\n\nThe Andean nation has been on a knife-edge since the vote.\n\nOpposition backers have staged rowdy protests since Monday and burned Supreme Electoral Tribunal offices in three cities.\n\nThe opposition bastion of Santa Cruz has seen two days of a partial strike \"in defence of the vote and democracy.\"", "description": "Official count supports Morales declaration of victory, but Mesa rejects results and calls on supporters to protest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/25/4fb534c8988a45a6bfdccbb068682deb_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
