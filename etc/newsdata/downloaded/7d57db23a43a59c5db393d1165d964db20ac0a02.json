This is what we aim to replace through the FitOps program.\u201d\n\nHesse opened Performix House in New York City in February 2018. It\u2019s an elite fitness gym that caters to military and professional athletes.\n\nHesse added: \u201cThe greatest joy and satisfaction in my career has come from playing a part in helping veterans find purpose through fitness, and my goal is to build on this so we never have to turn a veteran away. I\u2019m so grateful to John, not just for his donation, but for his incredible passion and support. Together, our goal is to take the suicide rate in the veteran community from 20 a day to 0.\u201d\n\nThis past summer, Cena spoke about the need of cultivating a community where veterans and those who have served their country get the recognition and appreciation they deserve.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nIn a panel speech, the \"Blockers\" actor explained that happiness for a man isn\u2019t always about the machismo element associated with being an \u201calpha-male,\u201d but the connection he may have to a group of people with a common goal.\n\n\u201cIt's a camaraderie that shows the alpha-male, [that] being the alpha-male isn't being a man. Being a man is being comfortable with who you are, looking at that person in the mirror being happy,\u201d said Cena. \u201cUnderstand that we're all flawed, facing those mistakes and those fears, and having a support system to back you up when you need help. Reach out and say \u2018I don't know if I can do this alone.\u2019 \u2014 Have people grab that hand, shake it and hold it.\u201d", "description": "WWE star John Cena took to the airwaves to share how he is giving back to American veterans.", "authors": ["Frank Miles", "Frank Miles Is A Reporter", "Editor Covering Geopolitics", "Military", "Crime", "Technology", "Sports For Foxnews.Com.
