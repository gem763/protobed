The president said he feels \"very honored\" by an invitation he had received from Merkel. \"I have German in my blood,\" he said.\n\nMerkel told reporters later that they have not yet agreed \"a specific date\" for the visit.\n\nThe meeting was remarkably relaxed in comparison to previous, often uncomfortable encounters between the two leaders. It stood in a stark contrast to an icy meeting at the D-Day commemorations in England in June, when Trump and Merkel did not even shake hands.\n\nAsked by a reporter whether he was concerned that the club of G7 leaders is going to lose its only female member when Merkel leaves office, Trump replied: \"She may surprise you. She may be here a long time, I know well.\"\n\n\"I'm still here,\" said Merkel, who then giggled.\n\nEven when it came to the tense issue of trade, the atmosphere remained amicable. Trump criticized the EU as \"very tough traders,\" but added: \"I don\u2019t hold it against the European Union, I hold it against our presidents and administrations that did not do a good job.\" Turning to Merkel, he said: \"I congratulate you.\"\n\nThe president also said he \"hope[s] not\" to impose tariffs on European cars \u2014 which would be a horror scenario for the German economy that is on the brink of recession \u2014 and lauded \"some very good discussions going on\" on trade.\n\nWhen Merkel, speaking in German, expressed her \"great interest\" in enhancing trade relations with the U.S. and said she wanted to reach a transatlantic trade deal \"as quickly as possible,\" Trump joked: \"This doesn't sound good.\"\n\nThat caused Merkel to laugh out loud.\n\nAfter an interpreter translated the chancellor's words, Trump said: \"Right, very good.\"", "description": "US president says he will visit Germany \u2018very soon.\u2019", "authors": ["Hans Von Der Burchard", "Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1164148564-1200x628.jpg"}
