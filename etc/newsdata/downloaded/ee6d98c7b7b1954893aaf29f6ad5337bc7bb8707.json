Make sure you don\u2019t wear any metal when you go through the security screening. Keep your seatbelt fastened until the seatbelt light gets turned off. Don\u2019t have sex in the bathroom.\n\nBut honestly, none of those are as important as following the cabin crew instructions when it comes to the emergency exits.\n\nFor the love of god, PLEASE do not open the emergency exit unless the plane has crashed. Just don\u2019t. Not because you want some fresh air, not because you want to admire the view. Nothing. Just don\u2019t fucking do it.\n\nIt was a 32 degree day when the incident took place, and we\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s hot. It\u2019s stuffy. You don\u2019t want to be sitting next to a smelly child. But that doesn\u2019t make it okay to open the emergency exit.\n\nA video of the incident has since gone viral, amassing a whopping 18 million views.\n\nThe woman, who appeared to be in her 50s, blatantly ignored cabin crew instructions and opened the door. A decision that she immediately regretted.\n\nObviously, the woman got in huge trouble and was escorted off the plane by police, presumably to be charged.\n\nOpening an emergency exit on an aircraft can be considered \u201cdisturbing public order\u201d, which is a very real crime that comes with a hefty fine and possible jail time.\n\nSo, if you were ever wondering what would happen if you opened the door, now you know. You will get kicked off the flight and sent straight to the police station. That\u2019s what will happen.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lavender Baj"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/pjimage-35.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
