Mnuchin's plans were first reported by business site Quartz.\n\n'What's next for global business?'\n\nThe conference - nicknamed \"Davos in the Desert\" - seeks to draw global investment banks and financiers to interact with Saudi officials and drum up investment for projects in the region. It will be held from October 29 to 31 at the Ritz Carlton in the capital.\n\nLast year, executives including JP Morgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Ford Motor Co Chairman Bill Ford pulled out of the conference after Khashoggi's October 2 disappearance.\n\nThe incident led to US Treasury sanctions on 17 Saudi individuals and a Senate resolution blaming Saudi Arabia's crown prince. But Saudi officials - including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - later blamed Khashoggi's death and reported dismemberment on rogue officials.\n\nAccording to a draft narrative programme obtained by American news site Axios, President of the World Bank David Malpass will attend this year, where the theme of the gathering asks the question \"What's next for global business?\"\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro are also on the list.\n\nAmong the financiers listed on the conference schedule are the CEOS of Citigroup, Credit Suisse and HSBC, in addition to Ray Dalio of Bridgewater, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Daniel Loeb of Third Point.\n\nAs he courts funders for Vision Fund 2, Masayoshi Son of SoftBank is on the programme as well.\n\nAlthough many of its journalists are listed as panel moderators, Bloomberg told Axios that the organisation will only be covering news at the conference and is \"not sponsoring the event or participating\".", "description": "After many notables skipped out in 2018, Saudi financial conference later this month will feature major business names.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/23/d8d14df80a234d418d14bb415667afb6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
