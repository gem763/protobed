Jackson voice for Alexa. He'll curse, if you want.", "language": "en", "text": "Oscar-nominated actor Samuel L. Jackson is lending his iconic voice to Amazon's Alexa \u2013 profanities and all.\n\nDuring Amazon's event to unveil new products and services Wednesday, the online shopping giant announced that Jackson will be the first celebrity voice for its Alexa virtual assistant and was created using neural text-to-speech technology.\n\nThere will be both an explicit version and a clean version when the feature launches later this year. The Alexa \"skill\" will cost 99 cents as an introductory offer and after the introductory period, the price will be $4.99, according to the product page.\n\nWhile Jackson is the first official celebrity voice for Alexa, in a 2018 Super Bowl commercial, celebrities Gordon Ramsay, Rebel Wilson, Cardi B and Anthony Hopkins were called on to fill in when Alexa lost hers. The commercial won USA TODAY's 30th Ad Meter.\n\nNew Amazon products: Amazon unveils its first-ever pair of smart glasses, the Echo Frames\n\nWant to work at McDonald's?: Ask Alexa or the Google Assistant for help\n\nAmazon also used star power in its 2019 Super Bowl commercial, which featured Harrison Ford, Forest Whitaker, and astronaut twins Mark and Scott Kelly.\n\nAmazon says Jackson will tell jokes, sing happy birthday, announce the weather, set timers and alarms, play music and more. You can also learn more about him \"by asking about his interests and career,\" Amazon says.\n\nHowever, he won't be able to do everything Alexa can and can't \"help with Shopping, lists, reminders or Skills.\"\n\nWhen the feature launches, Amazon says to get started you'll need to say, \u201cAlexa, introduce me to Samuel L. Jackson.\u201d\n\nAfter purchasing the feature, you choose whether you\u2019d like Jackson to use explicit language or not.\n\n\"If you change your mind later, simply go to the settings menu of the Alexa app to toggle between clean and explicit content,\" the product page says.\n\nAlexa also is coming to millions of Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac cars in the first half of 2020, General Motors announced Wednesday. GM said it will make Alexa available on model year 2018 and newer cars, trucks and crossovers with compatible infotainment systems.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Kelly Tyko on Twitter: @KellyTyko\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Samuel L.
