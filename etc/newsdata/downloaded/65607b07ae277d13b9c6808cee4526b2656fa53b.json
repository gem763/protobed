CrowdStrike is a Dem-connected company that is the ONLY source of the Russia-hacked-DNC-server claim: https://t.co/eLkmDKxu75 \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) September 26, 2019\n\nDespite \u201cmultiple\u201d requests, according to Comey, to access the server, the DNC refused. (Don\u2019t try that at home.) Instead, Perkins Coie hired CrowdStrike on behalf of DNC to examine the server. (Yes careful reader\u2014the same law firm that hired Fusion!)https://t.co/eLkmDKxu75 \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) September 26, 2019\n\nThe same law firm that hired Fusion.\n\nGosh folks, nothing shady to see here \u2026 nope.\n\nFrom American Greatness:\n\nWhile lawmakers and pundits on the Left and NeverTrump Right breezed past Trump\u2019s mention of CrowdStrike\u2014either out of subterfuge or ignorance\u2014it is significant. CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity firm with strong ties to the Democratic Party. After the DNC server was hacked in early 2016, Perkins Coie, a politically connected law firm, hired CrowdStrike on behalf of the DNC to find out who was behind the intrusion. (Perkins Coie is the same law firm that hired Fusion GPS on behalf of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign to dig up Russia-related dirt on Team Trump before the election.)\n\nCrowdStrike is the ONLY source to claim the DNC server was hacked by Russia.\n\nHave we mentioned how much something stinks here?\n\nKeep reading.\n\n\u201cIts co-founder is associated with the Clinton Foundation; CrowdStrike received $100 million in funding from Google whose chairman was a supporter of Clinton. CrowdStrike\u2019s president headed FBI\u2019s cybercrimes division during the Obama Adm when Robert Mueller was director.\u201d \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) September 26, 2019\n\nWow.\n\nEven more conflicts:In early 2016, as Comey\u2019s FBI began targeting Trump campaign, Crowdstrike was organizing cyber \u201cwar games\u201d with top DOJ officials. This included John Carlin, head of DOJ NSD which facilitated the FISA on Carter Page. Carlin also received updates from McCabe\u2026 \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) September 26, 2019\n\nWow. Wow.\n\non the Trump-Russia collusion probe. Oh and guess who else worked for Carlin? The current inspector general for the intelligence community \u2014 the guy handling the Ukraine \u201cwhistleblower\u201d complaint. Can\u2019t make it up, folkshttps://t.co/eLkmDKxu75 \u2014 Julie Kelly (@julie_kelly2) September 26, 2019\n\nYikes.\n\nYes, and the very same people at Fusion who were hired by Planned Parenthood to go after Center for Medical Progress whose videos proved out the illegal trafficking in aborted fetus body parts by PP. Just a lovely crowd aren\u2019t they? \u2014 Ed Kirwan (@EKDramatist) September 26, 2019\n\nLovely is not the word we\u2019d use for this crowd.\n\nRelated:\n\nGame-CHANGER?
