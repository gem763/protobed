The band played two songs for the crowd of children. In addition to \u201cCan\u2019t Stop\u201d off of their 2002 album By the Way, RHCP also played Andrew Gold\u2019s 1996 song \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons.\u201d\n\nIn the musical pantheon, there are relatively few Halloween pop hits. There\u2019s Bobby Pickett\u2019s \u201cThe Monster Mash\u201d and Roy Parker Jr.\u2019s \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cThriller\u201d probably counts, and though it wasn\u2019t conceived for the holiday, Rockwell\u2019s \u201cSomebody\u2019s Watching Me\u201d maybe counts too. Over the past few years, however, a perfect storm of internet trends has rocketed \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons\u201d to classic status more than 20 years after its initial release.\n\n\u201cYou meet a 13-year-old and they know him because of this song, which is fantastic,\u201d Leslie Kogan, Gold\u2019s widow, said in a phone interview. She has been in charge of Gold\u2019s back catalogue since he died in 2011 at the age of 59. Born in California in 1951, Gold found early success as a musician in the late 1960s, playing backup for Linda Ronstadt\u2019s band. He later found success on his own with hits like \u201cLonely Boy.\u201d He also wrote the music and lyrics for \u201cThank You for Being a Friend,\u201d the theme song to The Golden Girls.\n\nGold loved Halloween and he produced and performed much of Halloween Howls, the album featuring \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons,\u201d by himself. As a self-taught musician proficient on many instruments, Kogan referred to him as \u201ca one-man band.\u201d He brought in friends and family to collaborate on certain tracks; Ronstadt sings backing vocals on a cover of \u201cThe Monster Mash.\u201d\n\nThe song has a robust vocabulary for a track aimed at kids. A typical verse goes:\n\nSpooky, scary skeletons Shout startling, shrilly screams They\u2019ll sneak from their sarcophagus And just won\u2019t leave you be\n\nKogan herself stumbled over the word sarcophagus in discussing the song\u2019s alliterative nature. \u201cTo me the song completely personifies his genius,\u201d she professed. \u201cIt\u2019s got that Beatlesesque elements, but it\u2019s got those playfulness as well, like the clever lyrics.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe used to write a lot of stuff together, and it was very fast. It was just a blast working with him,\u201d said Greg Prestopino. Prestopino co-wrote and sang lead vocals on \u201cGimme a Smile (The Pumpkin Song).\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the only person I worked with who really qualified as a genius,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was nothing he couldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons\u201d was not an instant hit, and for some, it feels like the album came out a lifetime ago. Craig Schweitzer, credited with mastering the album, is now a pastor in Bismarck, North Dakota, and said he had little memory of the project. \u201cThanks again for the email and really fun flashback to another season of my life,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBut it would\u2019ve been foolish to expect skeletons to stay buried. A fortuitous chain of events has led \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons\u201d become a megaviral TikTok meme. It even has its own dance, created by user @minecrafter2011. There are, as of now, 2,537,466 posts on TikTok featuring the track, and if you need help with the dance, you can find plenty of tutorials on YouTube.\n\nThe story of how the song grew from an obscure novelty track to a seasonal classic and TikTok meme begins in 2006, when it was included on \u201cDisney Sing Along Songs: Happy Haunting,\u201d a home-video release. In one segment, the children traversing the Haunted Mansion come across a group of chroma-keyed skeletons dancing to a cover of Gold\u2019s song reminiscent of Kidz Bop.\n\nIntercut with the low-rent skeleton boogie are shots from the 1929 short, \u201cThe Skeleton Dance,\u201d a Disney classic constructed by famed animator Ub Iwerks.\n\nIn 2010, TJ Ski tried finding the segment online and came up short. \u201cI scoured the internet and couldn\u2019t find it, so I ended up just making it myself and splicing that Andrew Gold song with that video,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIt paired up perfectly.\u201d Ski\u2019s reconstructed version syncs up music and visuals more literally. When Gold plays the xylophone on the track, the cartoon skeletons play their ribs in similar fashion.\n\nThe version is the earliest piece of viral media featuring \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons\u201d and has garnered more than 31 million views over the last nine years.\n\n\u201cRight before Andrew died,\u201d Kogan said, \u201cI showed him the beginnings of this viral song and he was like \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 I\u2019m so happy that he at least got that glimpse of what was happening.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, remix artists the Living Tombstone remixed \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons,\u201d adding some EDM flair and speeding up the tempo. It\u2019s this version that\u2019s probably the most well-known version of the song, which has garnered 94 million views on YouTube and gone viral on TikTok.\n\nNeither the 2010 skeleton video nor the 2013 remix would\u2019ve reached their current heights without the introduction of a concept known as the Skeleton War, as popularized in a single tweet from @Dril, the patron saint of Weird Twitter: \u201cif your grave doesnt say \u2018rest in peace\u2019 on it you are automatically drafted into the skeleton war.\u201d\n\nif your grave doesnt say \"rest in peace\" on it you are automatically drafted into the skeleton war \u2014 wint (@dril) July 28, 2013\n\nInternet users have run with Dril\u2019s idea, particularly on Tumblr. And when they do, they often make a reference to TJ Ski\u2019s \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons\u201d video, which received relatively little attention when it first went live, then started getting a lot more viewers. \u201cDuring the rest of the year, it\u2019s extremely popular,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets probably 10,000, 15,000 views per day, just in July or April. But then during October, it\u2019ll get 100,000 views a day.\u201d\n\nPeople revisit Ski\u2019s video like it\u2019s a tradition, and nine years later, he still responds to comments, which shocks certain users. \u201cPeople respond like, \u2018Oh my God, from nine years ago! I thought you were dead!\u2019\u201d Ski doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time making YouTube videos, but he has settled into his niche as having popularized \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons,\u201d even going so far as to write a children\u2019s book on the theme.\n\nThe song has become a meme of its own, grafted onto other Halloween internet ephemera, like the dancing pumpkin man. (\u201cThe one guy with the pumpkin head, it\u2019s hilarious. He\u2019s like a dork,\u201d Kogan said with a laugh.) \u201cSpooky scary skeletons send shivers down your spine\u201d has become a stand-alone copy-pasta, joining other famous web-native Halloween jokes like \u201cspoopy.\u201d\n\nSo it was my own spooky scary skeleton that sent shivers down my spine https://t.co/kV4ZEm5vGQ \u2014 \ud83c\udf83 AlphaSpook \ud83c\udf83 (@Alphamew17) September 13, 2019\n\nEvery year for the past five years or so, Kogan has seen streams of her husband\u2019s song spike on YouTube and Spotify, and \u201cit gets bigger and bigger every year.\u201d Its surge on TikTok is a surprising resurrection for a song that by Kogan\u2019s own account was \u201cplucked out of obscurity.\u201d On October 18, Concord Records, which now has the rights, will release an officially sanctioned version of the Living Tombstone remix.\n\nGold\u2019s most famous song remains \u201cThank You for Being a Friend\u201d \u2026 for now. Kogan learned about the popularity of \u201cSpooky Scary Skeletons\u201d on TikTok through her friends\u2019 kids. It\u2019s difficult to imagine that the person who wrote the Golden Girls theme song might become more famous for something else, but \u201cthis one is crawling up,\u201d Kogan admitted. \u201cYouth is probably the most important market to get. For this demographic, there\u2019s no question that this is his biggest song.\u201d", "description": "The old song has found new life thanks to a viral dance craze on TikTok and an overall fascination with skeleton memes.", "authors": ["Brian Feldman"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/15/15-spooky-scary-skeletons.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
