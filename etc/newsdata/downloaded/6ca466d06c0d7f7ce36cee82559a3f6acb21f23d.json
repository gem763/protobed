Just before noon today, the Raiders announced that they had released the wide receiver. This follows a convoluted saga involving Brown taking to social media and demanding to be released from his contract. As ESPN\u2019s report on the situation notes, a recent fine from the team may have violated his contract with them, giving him grounds to seek a way out.\n\nThe Raiders fined Brown $215,073.53 for conduct detrimental to the team, league sources told Schefter on Saturday. By fining Brown, the Raiders voided the $29.125 million worth of guaranteed money in his deal, sources told Schefter.\n\nLate Friday night, Brown posted a video on YouTube featuring audio from a call from Raiders coach Jon Gruden.\n\nIt suggests a player deeply frustrated with his current situation. If the video suggests that, Brown\u2019s description of the video removes any sense of ambiguity about what\u2019s going on.\n\nWith all these false narratives antagonizing me, it\u2019s time for me to control my own narrative. Show the world I\u2019m not the bad guy. Show the world you can free yourself from the lies and become your own person. I am not just AB the football player, I am Antonio Brown, the person, who paved a way for himself to be in charge of his own life. Free me!\n\nEarlier this morning, Brown used another social media platform \u2014 Instagram, in this case \u2014 to ask the Raiders to release him.\n\nESPN has more analysis of the video, along with an exploration of the frustrations Brown has experienced with Oakland to date \u2014 most recently, an argument with Raiders general manager Mike Mayock.\n\nWhere will Brown end up now that he\u2019s able to sign with another team? That remains to be seen.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: RealClearLife, a news and lifestyle publisher, is now a part of InsideHook.
