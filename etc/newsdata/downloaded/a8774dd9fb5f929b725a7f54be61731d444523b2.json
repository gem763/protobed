The proclamation targets immigrants who have come to the US legally under policies Trump and his advisers often attack.\n\nVice President Pence meets with newly naturalized US citizens following a naturalization ceremony held on Constitution Day in Washington, DC, on September 17, 2019.\n\nWin McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHe has blamed the diversity visa lottery and chain migration for bringing in the perpetrators of two terror attacks in New York in December 2017, claiming during his State of the Union address the following January that \u201cthese programs present risks we can just no longer afford.\u201d\n\n\u201cChain migration is a disaster, and very unfair to our country,\u201d he said during another address in February 2018. \u201cThe visa lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place. People enter a lottery to come into our country. What kind of a system is that? It is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump has already been waging a quiet and effective campaign to reduce overall legal immigration, the long-held goal of groups like the Center for Immigration Studies and the Federation for American Immigration Reform have long sought.\n\nBut Friday\u2019s proclamation could be the most drastic of those changes \u2014 reshaping the immigration system in the US during Trump\u2019s time in office along exactly the lines restrictionists have wanted.\n\nWhile the proclamation is on its face about health care, even Joe Grogan, the director of the White House domestic policy council, told reporters on Wednesday that it is \u201cnot part of the health care agenda,\u201d but the immigration agenda.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing less than a legal immigration ban,\u201d Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigrant advocacy group America\u2019s Voice, said in a statement.\n\nHow the rule would work\n\nSome immigrants, mostly family members of US citizens or green card holders, can apply for lawful permanent residency abroad and obtain a green card almost immediately. Otherwise, immigrants can come to the US on two types of visas: those for immigrants who intend to settle in the US permanently and eventually obtain a green card, and those that only allow an immigrant to remain in the US temporarily.\n\nIn order to get a green card, an immigrant will have to prove to a consular officer that they will obtain health insurance within 30 days of their arrival in the US. If they can\u2019t, they must demonstrate that they will be able to pay for their medical expenses.\n\nThe proclamation does not lay out clear procedures for determining whether immigrants meet the proclamation\u2019s requirements \u2014 it will be up to individual consular officers charged with evaluating visa applications and the State Department, which is expected to issue internal guidance on it.\n\nBut based on insurance coverage alone, the majority of adults who were granted green cards over the last three years would have been shut out.\n\nPresident Trump is seen on a television screen addressing new US citizens during naturalization ceremony in Miami on August 16, 2019.\n\nJoe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nAccording to the Migration Policy Institute, 34 percent of those recent green card recipients are uninsured, and another 31 percent have other health care benefits that don\u2019t count as insurance under the proclamation, including Medicaid or insurance purchased with subsidies on an Affordable Care Act exchange.\n\nFamilies don\u2019t stop qualifying for individual insurance subsidies until they have a household income that is at least four times the federal poverty line, or over $103,000 for a family of four and nearly $50,000 for an individual. That\u2019s a threshold that is hard to clear for all but the wealthiest immigrants: The median income for a US immigrant household was $56,000, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nThe proclamation applies to all immigrants applying for visas at consulates abroad with the intention of living in the US permanently. There are some limited exceptions: immigrants who already have a valid visa, children of US citizens, unaccompanied children, permanent residents who have been outside of the US for more than one year, and recipients of \u201cspecial immigrant visas\u201d for Afghans and Iraqis who have aided the US government and their families.\n\nThe administration can also make additional exceptions on a case-by-case basis. But parents and spouses of US citizens and the immediate family members of lawful permanent residents are subject to the proclamation.\n\nThe rule will fall hardest on immigrants who are sponsored by family members and those from the diversity visa lottery. Just under 84,000 people have already been selected for the diversity lottery in 2020: 38 percent from African countries, 37 percent from European countries, 19 percent from Asia, and the rest from Latin America and Oceania. Immigrants with job offers will have an easier time, as they will likely have health insurance through their employer, Gelatt said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear at this point what income level would be sufficient to be approved for a visa under the proclamation.\n\nA State Department official said Monday that consular officers will decide whether applicants are eligible for a visa under the proclamation based on information available when they apply for a visa, including medical and financial documentation that is already required as part of their application package.\n\nSabreen Alabdalah (center) and her daughters take part in a children\u2019s citizenship ceremony in Oakland, California, on Monday, July 29, 2019.\n\nJane Tyska/The Mercury News via Getty Images\n\nThat most likely refers to the income and asset information submitted by a \u201csponsor,\u201d usually a US citizen or lawful permanent resident family member or an employer, who claims financial responsibility for a visa applicant, immigration lawyer Rafael Urena said.\n\nFor the immigrants who are let in, Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said that the proclamation is likely to push immigrants to buy short-term or visitor insurance policies, which generally don\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions, and often have caps or limits on benefits. It will also probably discourage immigrants from enrolling in insurance through Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, he added.\n\n\u201cThese new rules are going to add to the confusion and fear surrounding recent immigration policy changes, discouraging lawfully present immigrants from enrolling in programs they are eligible for,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric focuses on unauthorized immigration. But he\u2019s cut back legal immigration too.\n\nWhile his moves to block asylum seekers at the southern border has gotten the most attention, Trump has also taken steps to restrict legal immigration to the US. His travel ban blocking citizens of Iran, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, and Somalia from entering the US is still in effect and has been upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nHe\u2019s slowed down processing of legal immigrants, almost doubling average wait times for those applying for green cards, employment visas, citizenship, and other benefits by the end of 2018. And he\u2019s slashed the refugee admissions cap to a historic low of 18,000, down from 110,000 just two years ago.\n\nSome within his administration want to go even further. Miller has been the architect of sweeping administrative changes that aim to keep out all but the wealthiest immigrants.\n\nSenior policy adviser, Stephen Miller and White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, attend UN global call to protect religious freedom at the UN Headquarters, in New York, on September 23, 2019.\n\nLev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nHe was behind the so-called \u201cpublic charge regulation,\u201d which, if it goes into effect October 15, would give immigration officials much more leeway to turn away low-income immigrants based on an evaluation of 20 factors, ranging from the use of certain public benefits programs \u2014 including food stamps, Section 8 housing vouchers, and Medicaid \u2014 to English language proficiency. That regulation could affect over 382,000 people seeking to enter the US, extend their visa, or upgrade their temporary visa to a green card.\n\n\u201c[Immigration] touches upon everything, but the goal is to create an immigration system that enhances the vibrancy, the unity, the togetherness and the strength of our society,\u201d Miller told the Washington Post.\n\nTrump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner has also reportedly been working on an immigration reform plan that wouldn\u2019t raise immigration levels, but it would move toward a points-based system under which immigrants with higher levels of education, English language skills, and job offers from US companies would be prioritized over family members of US citizens and permanent residents.\n\nPresident Trump with senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner during the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, on August 25, 2019.\n\nStefan Rousseau/PA Images via Getty Images\n\nKushner\u2019s plan would need to be passed in Congress, an unlikely prospect when immigration issues have never been so politically fraught. But Trump\u2019s Friday night proclamation accomplishes similar goals without needing to capitulate to Democrats, so long as it survives in court.\n\nAdvocates are expected to file legal challenges to the proclamation in the coming weeks. But with a Supreme Court that has already recognized this president\u2019s broad powers to restrict immigration where the administration can provide a rationale, there\u2019s no telling whether the justices will view this case differently.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nicole Narea"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTMFwe_YO6QTOOBqvlS64N0Tixo=/0x0:5228x3485/1400x1050/filters:focal(1589x1230:2425x2066):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/65435601/GettyImages_1168848092.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
