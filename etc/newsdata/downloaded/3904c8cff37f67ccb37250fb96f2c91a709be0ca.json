Sign up here.\n\nThe Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover said it is open to finding partners for the automaker but isn\u2019t planning on selling the embattled unit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sell,\u201d said Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons Ltd., the holding company in an expansive business empire that includes Tata Motors Ltd. \u201cAuto is a core business for us. From revenue terms, auto is our largest company.\u201d\n\nTata Motors bought the maker of the Jaguar XE sedan and Land Rover Discovery sport utility vehicle from Ford Motor Co. in 2008. After turning it into a cash cow with booming sales in countries like Russia and China, JLR waned to such an extent that it\u2019s had to launch a 2.5 billion-pound ($3.2 billion) savings program and slash thousands of jobs worldwide.\n\nLosses at Tata\u2019s automotive business have mounted with a slump in India\u2019s car market, as well as trouble overseas, including an economic slowdown in China, where auto sales are sliding, and uncertainty over Brexit. JLR is closing its U.K. factories for a week in November to guard against disruption to supply chains from a possible no-deal Brexit.\n\nChandrasekaran said China sales have \u201ccollapsed\u201d with a 50% drop last year, though 2019 is showing some improvement. Some problems were self-inflicted, including vehicle quality and dealer issues, he said, noting that the auto industry is \u201cgoing through difficult times.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting the right portfolio, which one we invest in for electric vehicles, and how do we cut cost\u201d are issues that need to be resolved, he said.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television earlier Tuesday, Chandrasekaran said dealing with tariffs is the \u201cnew normal\u201d for the global auto industry and that negotiations around Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union have taken too long. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s better to have clarity than a desirable result,\u201d he said. \u201cNations are getting more protective.\u201d\n\nThe troubles of JLR are bogging down the Tata group as a whole, with Tata Motors writing down its investment in the British brands earlier this year by $3.9 billion. The salt-to-software conglomerate is among India\u2019s most indebted, and the slump in the auto market is hitting both Tata Motors and Tata Steel, the nation\u2019s biggest maker of the alloy.\n\nAnalysts at Sanford C. Bernstein last month described JLR as \u201cseverely challenged\u201d and said Tata Motors should look at BMW AG as a buyer because the German company is \u201cawash with cash.\u201d Tata has previously denied reports it is looking at strategic options for JLR, including a possible stake sale.\n\nWhile the company would \u201calways look for partnerships,\u201d it doesn\u2019t want deals where \u201cwe just sell a stake and we have no say,\u201d Chandrasekaran said Tuesday in New York. \u201cWe are not financial investors, Tata Group, we run companies. I\u2019m not a Blackstone, I\u2019m not a KKR.\u201d\n\nJLR\u2019s capital expenditure has outpaced operating cash flow over the past two years, but Chandrasekaran said his target is to reverse that trend by 2021. \u201cOnce we do that, then people will believe what I\u2019m saying: I\u2019m not running away.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Scarlet Fu, Caroline Hyde and Sam Nagarajan.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Craig Trudell in New York at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net;Gabrielle Coppola in New York at gcoppola@bloomberg.net;Anurag Kotoky in New Delhi at akotoky@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Craig Trudell at ctrudell1@bloomberg.net, ;Young-Sam Cho at ycho2@bloomberg.net, Will Davies, Chester Dawson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Terms of Trade is a daily newsletter that untangles a world embroiled in trade wars.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0The Indian conglomerate that owns Jaguar Land Rover said it is open to finding partners for the automaker but isn\u2019t planning on selling the embattled unit.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to sell,\u201d said", "authors": ["Craig Trudell", "Gabrielle Coppola", "Anurag Kotoky"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/t.D2eksk51iUz20ibFoMkw--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/6a2a28a1fcb14cdb5f3e3c7451a276d9", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
