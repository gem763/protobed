Do you think I would waste his time talking about this stuff?\"\n\nShe also said Mr Johnson had nothing to do with an additional \u00a3100,000 grant awarded to her company by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in January.\n\nAnd she denied reports he had written her a letter of recommendation to run the taxpayer-funded Tech City organisation, promoting technology companies in east London.\n\nPolitically, this interview still leaves the big question hanging out there - did Boris Johnson use his influence or seek to intervene in any way to help Jennifer Arcuri secure grants or to go on trade delegations?\n\nWhat we did learn was that she was most certainly a very, very close friend.\n\nWhy that matters is because if there is any suggestion - or proof, more importantly - that Mr Johnson did intervene on her behalf, then he would have had to declare that she was a friend.\n\nAnd that is the missing piece of the jigsaw.\n\nWe don't know whether Boris Johnson did seek to use his office in any way to lean on city officials to get her on those trade trips or to also get her the grants.\n\nWe do know that he went to speak at a number of events she organised and we do know that Boris Johnson was on three of the trade trips she was on.\n\nSo that raises the question that, in any case, should he have declared he was a close friend of Ms Arcuri's?\n\nThere will be a lot of headlines about her refusal to deny they had a relationship, but in terms of the politics, the big question is still to be answered on whether he intervened on her behalf because of their relationship.\n\nMs Arcuri told Good Morning Britain the pair shared \"a love\" and \"passion\" for Shakespeare and literature during their friendship,\n\n\"Boris is extremely personable. He cares a lot about this country, and he cares a lot about people... he is a guy you want to hang out with.\"\n\nAsked whether she ever loved Mr Johnson, she said: \"I've been asked that many times. And I care about him deeply as a friend, and we do share a very close bond, but I wish him well.\n\n\"I really do want him to focus on making Britain great again.\"\n\nWho is Jennifer Arcuri?\n\nJennifer Arcuri describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer.\n\nShe began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMs Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers.\n\nBut it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson.\n\nThe network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012.\n\nSince then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.", "description": "The businesswoman denies the PM showed her favouritism because of their friendship when he was London mayor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q9v83.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
