More specifically, it is the concrete flight of steps that Joaquin Phoenix, caked in clown paint, dances down in the film Joker. The scene has become a meme, and scores of influencers and imbeciles are flocking to the #jokerstairs, as it is now tagged on Instagram, to recreate the image. Such is the fervour that the location was briefly marked as a religious site on Google Maps.\n\nBronx locals are not thrilled by their staircase going viral. One resident put up posters explaining that \u201cit is disrespectful to treat our community \u2026 as a photo opportunity\u201d. Someone else, clearly fancying themselves as a yolker, threw eggs at tourists while yelling: \u201cY\u2019all not spending no money in my store but come and take pictures!\u201d\n\nThere is nothing new about disrespectful sightseers. Nor is there anything new about movie locations becoming tourist attractions. However, the speed with which a scene can break off from its original source, take on new life as a meme and transform an offline location into the seventh circle of selfie hell is a modern phenomenon. Some people call it the Instagram effect. Wired described it recently as \u201cmeme tourism\u201d. Other people \u2013 me \u2013 call it \u201cYet another sign that humans deserve to go extinct\u201d.\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when we all at least pretended that travel might broaden our horizons. Now tourism seems to be about building our personal brands. Forget \u201cmeme tourism\u201d \u2013 this is more like me-me-me tourism: getting likes by jumping on the latest viral trend or showing how edgy you are by snapping selfies at Chernobyl. \u201cAll the world\u2019s a stage,\u201d as a famous influencer once put it. That is more true than ever, but only a privileged few are the players \u2013 everyone else is merely #content.\n\n\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The sightseers flocking to a staircase from Joker confirm it \u2013 travel today is less about broadening your horizons and more about building your brand, writes Arwa Mahdawi", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bf25ef39c5e9bf6ebad650205a7182fcd9aca54/0_258_3872_2323/master/3872.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8454d0a7d0958441c7db0a86e9e20095", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
