Chance of a few showers mainly on windward coastal areas in far southwest. Cloudier in the north, perhaps with a little rain at first, before becoming brighter with a few showers.\n\nTonight:\n\nRain over parts of Kent and East Anglia. Otherwise mainly dry with some clear spells. Cold with frost in Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England. A few fog patches possible.\n\nMonday:\n\nMainly dry with sunny spells. Showers for eastern England, with rain in the southeast for a time. Cloud increasing in far north with rain and coastal gales likely later.\n\nOutlook for Tuesday to Thursday:\n\nWindy and cloudy with some rain in the north, heavy at times in western Scotland. Mostly dry in the south with chilly nights and fog patches early and late.", "description": "The Met Office has predicted drier weather in coming days after weeks of rain and flood warnings", "authors": ["Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20658287.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Spring-weather-May-4th-2016.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
