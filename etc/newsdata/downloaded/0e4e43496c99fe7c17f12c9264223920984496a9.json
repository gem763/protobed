And I wanted to experience some of that. I played the field and I enjoyed every moment of it.\n\n\u2018But, in the end, I finished up with a boy, a very sweet boy, and we\u2019re still together all these years later.\u2019\n\nOn the subject of her family life, the \u2018Two to Make It Right\u2019 co-singer also told the publication that her eldest daughter suffered from an eating disorder, saying: \u2018Lillie has had something of a \u00adtroubled teenagehood, battling \u00adanorexia.\n\n\u2018But she\u2019s doing well now. She\u2019s my queer child: that\u2019s the word she and her friends prefer to use. It used to be a negative term but it\u2019s being reclaimed by what you and I might call the gay community.\u2019\n\nMichelle sadly has experienced anorexia herself first hand. In 2015, she told the Huffington Post: \u2018I was so tough on myself at 13, with what I did to myself, with the eating disorders, the anorexia, and just striving to be skinny and wanting to be loved.\n\n\u2018And the truth of the matter is, I was loved by everybody around me, more than I could handle\u2026 except for myself. I was the one who didn\u2019t love myself. And to this day, I still struggle with it, but I\u2019m much more aware of when I\u2019m being mean to myself, versus when I was 13.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter her high-scoring Cabaret routine on Strictly for movie week, Michelle wrote on her Instagram about embracing being \u2018a lady of a certain age\u2019 and still tearing up the dance floor on Strictly.\n\nShe wrote: \u2018Words cannot express how grateful I am for this opportunity. I\u2019m a 51 year old mother of two, who gets to learn how to dance from a world champion on national telly. THIS is a dream.\n\n\u2018I am NOT a dancer and you all are so wonderful to be there with me and root for me and cheer me on to believe that I CAN be a dancer,\u2019 she continued.\n\n\u2018You are my life force. You are my soul. \u2018When I think I can\u2019t do it, I think of you all expecting the best from #Team Visagio\u2019.\n\nMichelle is due to be dancing on Strictly Come Dancing tonight, with the episode airing from 6:40pm on BBC One.\n\nMORE: Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Shirley Ballas was convinced breast implants would \u2018save\u2019 her marriage to ex-husband", "description": "As we wait for the next episode of Strictly to drop, let's take a look RuPaul's Drag Race judge Michelle Visage's family life...", "authors": ["Aidan Milan"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88170195-e1571484437618_1571488779.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
