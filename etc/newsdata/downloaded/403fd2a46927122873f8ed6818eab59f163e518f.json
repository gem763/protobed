The title of the book is in her mother tongue, Luo, and means \u201cstar\u201d.\n\nLupita posted a picture of herself as a child and wrote, \u201cThis is 5-year-old me. I reflected on this little girl\u2019s feelings and fantasies when I decided to write my children\u2019s book, #Sulwe. With this book, I wanted to hold up a mirror for her. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\u201cAs a little girl reading, I had all of these windows into the lives of people who looked nothing like me, chances to look into their worlds, but I didn\u2019t have any mirrors. While windows help us develop empathy and an understanding of the wider world, mirrors help us develop our sense of self, and our understanding of our own world. They ground us in our body and our experiences,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe 12 Years a Slave actress said it\u2019s not true that colourism only affects people living in parts of the world dominated by white people, reports Rolling Out. Even in Africans countries where dark skin is the norm, Africans still see lighter skin as superior, Lupita said.\n\n\u201cColorism, society\u2019s preference for lighter skin, is alive and well. It\u2019s not just a prejudice reserved for places with a largely white population. Throughout the world, even in Kenya, even today, there is a popular sentiment that lighter is brighter,\u201d she continued.\n\nLupita concluded her post by saying, \u201cI imagined what it would have been like for this little girl to turn the pages of her picture books and see more dark skin in a beautiful light. This book is my dream come true for kids like her today.\u201d\n\nThe book\u2019s publishers, Simon & Schuster, say Sulwe is a compelling picture book addressing colourism and self-esteem. It will teach young girls that true beauty comes from within, reports BET.\n\nHaving gone through immense discrimination herself as a young, dark-skinned girl, Lupita felt compelled to write a book that would not only represent people with dark skin, but also celebrate it. In an interview with Glamour magazine a few years ago, the actress told a painful story of just one of the incidents that happened to her as a child.\n\n\u201cIn the second grade, one of my teachers said, \u2018Where are you going to find a husband? How are you going to find someone darker than you?\u2019 I was mortified.\u201d\n\nA synopsis for the book reads: \u201cSulwe has skin the colour of midnight. She is darker than everyone in her family. She is darker than anyone in her school. Sulwe just wants to be beautiful and bright, like her mother and sister. Then a magical journey in the night sky opens her eyes and changes everything,\u201d reports Afropunk.", "description": "Actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o\u2019s much-anticipated children\u2019s book is finally hitting shelves later this month and the Black Panther star took to social media to explain why this project is so important to her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9457/ac495ef1b2144dfc882586bcc4b14db4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
