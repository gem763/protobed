The fellas smoke their three cigarettes for the year and we all stay up way past our bedtime!\u201d\n\nAccording to a press release, David Lee Roth: ROCKS VEGAS will feature \u201c26 instantly recognizable songs, including \u2018Jump,\u2019 \u2018Panama,\u2019 and \u2018California Girls.\u2019\u201d It goes on to label the music \u201cthe sound of a generational prison break.\u201d\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nThis is actually Roth\u2019s second Las Vegas show. In 1995, he tried out a lounge act in the casino town featuring Nile Rodgers, Edgar Winter, members of the Miami Sound machine and exotic dancers. The show contained just two Van Halen songs and instead focused on covers like Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cHard to Handle\u201d and James Brown\u2019s \u201cLiving in America.\u201d It struggled to sell tickets and closed within months.\n\nThis new Vegas show is sure to cause many Van Halen fans to question the group\u2019s future. They have been completely inactive since wrapping up a 2015 summer tour at the Hollywood Bowl. \u201cThe best years of my life, high points of all of my life, onstage with you, homeboy,\u201d Roth told Eddie Van Halen that night. \u201cI will always do the half Jesus towards you.\u201d\n\nEddie and Alex Van Halen have rarely been seen in public since that night, though earlier this year original bassist Michael Anthony says he was contacted about a possible tour. \u201cI spoke with [Van Halen\u2019s manager] Irving Azoff last October,\u201d he told Eddie Trunk. \u201cHe asked if I would be interested in any kind of a reunion, and I told him, I said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 I was finishing up a couple of shows with Sammy [Hagar] and I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d be interested to hear what you guys have going on. I\u2019ve got these few dates left, and give me a call.\u2019\u201d\n\nA couple months later, Anthony heard from a representative for David Lee Roth and wheels seemed to be in motion. \u201cAnd for whatever reason, they never got in touch with us about any kind of a contract or any kind of a meeting to discuss or whatever,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cThe next thing I knew, the plug got pulled on it.\u201d\n\nSammy Hagar has gone on record several times saying he\u2019d gladly return for a tour where he shared vocal duties with David Lee Roth on the condition that Michael Anthony also returns to the fold. \u201cCan you imagine the competition of that?\u201d he told Rolling Stone in 2017. \u201cDave goes out and does \u2018Jump,\u2019 and \u2018Ain\u2019t Talkin \u2018Bout Love.\u2019 I go out there and blow out something like \u2018Good Enough.\u2019 You gotta hit it hard, and you better be good. I would give my money to food banks if they would do the same. I would love to give the fans the greatest Van Halen show they could possibly have today. And then say, \u2018OK, I still don\u2019t like you guys.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis dream tour always seemed like a long shot, but now that David Lee Roth has booked a deal to play the hits by himself in Las Vegas, it seems even less likely that it will ever happen. It just doesn\u2019t seem like a move he\u2019d make if he saw a big tour coming in the future, but this band\u2019s history is so crazy that predicting any future move is nearly impossible.\n\nDavid Lee Roth: VEGAS ROCKS at the House of Blues Las Vegas\n\nJanuary 8th, 10th, 11th\n\nMarch 18th, 20th, 21st, 25th, 27th and 28th\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
