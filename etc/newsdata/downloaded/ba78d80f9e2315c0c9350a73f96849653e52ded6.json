There needs to be a way out of that.\"\n\nMoving the motion in Bournemouth, Sir Vince said: \"Brexit will make us poorer and risks breaking up our United Kingdom.\n\n\"We must stop it and we will.\"\n\nHe added: \"Jo [Swinson] is ready to steer us back into government as our new captain.\n\n\"And now, I am full of confidence and hope for our party and for our country.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jo Swinson: 'Meet the newest Lib Dem MP - Sam Gyimah'\n\nThe Lib Dems are enjoying a resurgence on the back of its anti-Brexit stance.\n\nThe party currently has 18 MPs, having been boosted by a victory in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, along with defections from both Labour and the Conservatives over the summer.\n\nThe latest to join the ranks is former Conservative Sam Gyimah, who had the Tory whip removed earlier this month when he voted to block a no-deal Brexit.", "description": "Members vote in favour of the policy, which would see the party revoke Article 50 if they took power.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/BC35/production/_108818184_b073444f-0e29-4ff9-999f-9d1a822b82b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
