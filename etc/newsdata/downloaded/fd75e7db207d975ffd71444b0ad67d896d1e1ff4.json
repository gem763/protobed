At first, she was surprised the stores even approved her for their credit cards. But then she started collecting points on every visit.\n\n\u201cLoft offered me 30% off on my first purchase,\u201d Beach said. \u201cI keep spending to get free clothes and now I have $65 in points.\u201d\n\nBeach, like many others, says she\u2019s \u201creally hooked\u201d on getting free clothes. But she can no longer afford to pay the full balances. The high interest on these cards has piled up and she now owes more than $3,000 on the Loft store card alone. Beach is charged an annual percentage rate of 26.24% on the Loft card and 26.74% on the Kohl\u2019s card. (Loft and Kohl\u2019s did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nBeach is far from alone. The latest Experian EXPGY, +1.37% data shows the 90+ day retail delinquency rate for consumers with a VantageScore at or below 600 is rising. Like the more widely used FICO credit score, VantageScore uses a range between 300 and 850. A score below 601 is generally considered to be poor. The delinquency rate rose to 11.2% in the first quarter of 2019, up from 11.1% the previous quarter. In 2015, it was a little over 8%.\n\nBecky Beach Becky Beach, an avid shopper with a low credit score, has found herself trapped in the \u2018shop more, earn more points\u2019 game that retailers play.\n\nIn contrast, the 90+ day retail delinquency rate for shoppers with a good VantageScore (higher than 600) has not changed much since 2015. The rate has remained below 0.04% and in the first quarter of 2019 the figure still stands at 0.03%.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Half of Americans with this credit card regretted getting one\n\nMost store cards have reward programs that can encourage overspending. But the potential downsides of higher-than-average annual percentage rates can outweigh the rewards shoppers get. The LoveLoft store card charges an interest rate of 27.24%, according to WalletHub. The average retail credit card purchase APR was 25.81% in the second quarter of 2019, WalletHub found. The average APR on a traditional bank-issued credit card is 16.91%, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s data for the same quarter.\n\nThough the probability of shoppers with bad credit going delinquent is high, the recent increase in delinquencies could also be due to more lending to subprime borrowers, said Experian director of consumer education and awareness Rod Griffin. \u201cAs the companies look for more customers we see a slight uptick,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nRetail stores routinely hand out cards with perks to walk-in customers without conducting credit checks, says CreditCards.com analyst Ted Rossman. Consumers with poor credit have more options than ever. Amazon AMZN, +0.60% for example, now offers a \u201cCredit Builder\u201d card explicitly designed for people with bad credit or who are new to credit.\n\nAmazon\u2019s partner on this financial product is the dominant private-label card issuer, Synchrony Bank. Its most recent earnings report showed more evidence of a rise in retail card delinquencies. The company\u2019s second quarter charge-off rate \u2014 the percentage of loans a firm gives up on collecting \u2014 rose to 6.01% compared to 5.97% last year; excluding the PayPal PYPL, +1.85% Credit program and the Walmart WMT, +1.11% portfolio.\n\nWhile consumers tempted with deep discounts don\u2019t often think about going delinquent on their cards, CompareCards.com analyst Matt Schulz said it\u2019s no surprise delinquencies for individuals with low credit scores are rising.\n\n\u201cWith debt continuing to rise, it makes all the sense in the world that delinquencies would rise, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re still generally low by historical standards, but I do expect them to continue to rise.\u201d\n\nRetail cards are great credit builder cards if used wisely\n\nBeach owns private label cards of other retailers like Banana Republic and JC Penny JCP, +1.38% , all with high interest rates. While the rates can pinch consumers failing to pay full balances, retail cards, when used well, can be a good starter tool to improve credit health.\n\n\u201cAs long as they are paying at least the minimum balance, it will help build some credit,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAnd in time they will get access to other cards as well.\u201d\n\nAnother option for building credit is a secured credit card. They act just like any other card but require a cash deposit that acts as collateral against the credit limit. Amazon\u2019s new prime builder credit card is an example of a secured card. It has a 28.24% APR and allows a consumer to upgrade to its store card after the account has been in good standing for a year.\n\nFor low credit score holders, the credit limit on secured cards can be low but they are a less risky alternative.\n\n3 ways to avoid falling victim to \u2018earn while you shop\u2019 retail schemes\n\n1) It can be dangerous for consumers to apply for everything that comes their way.\n\n\u201cIf you get an offer, it doesn\u2019t always mean you have to accept it,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nRead the terms carefully. Ultimately, consumers must make a decision based on their financial needs.\n\n2) Only sign up for a store credit card if you know you can pay the balance in full.\n\n\u201cWith retail card rates about five percentage points higher than general-purpose credit cards (and about 15 percentage points higher than low interest credit cards), carrying a balance on a store card is really expensive,\u201d said Rossman.\n\n3) Consider the opportunity cost.\n\nStore cards make most sense when someone is loyal to a particular store, said Rossman. \u201cThere\u2019s a credit score impact to opening cards, so you want to pick and choose the best cards,\u201d he added.", "description": "Retailers push store cards with deep discounts, but low-credit-score shoppers fail to pay balances.", "authors": ["Karishma Vanjani"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ437_kohls0_ZG_20190829161303.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
