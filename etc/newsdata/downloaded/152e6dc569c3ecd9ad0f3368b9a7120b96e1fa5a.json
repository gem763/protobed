As president, Biden will pursue constitutional, common-sense gun safety policies,\" Biden's campaign website states.\n\nUnder his newly released plan, Biden is calling for:\n\nBanning \"the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\"\n\nRegulating the \"possession of existing assault weapons under the National Firearms Act,\" meaning AR-15s and similar weapons will be regulated like actual machine guns.\n\nInstituting a buy back program for \"assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.\"\n\nSupporting legislation that only allows one firearm purchase per month.\n\nUniversal background checks.\n\nEnding the online sale of firearms and ammunitions, which includes kits and gun parts.\n\nSupporting legislation that give states and local governments grants to require people to obtain a license prior to purchasing firearms.\n\nPutting \"America on the path to ensuring that 100% of firearms sold in America are smart guns,\" meaning only guns can fire if it matches the owner's fingerprints.\n\n\"As president, Joe Biden will defeat the NRA again,\" his website adds, pointing to how he helped pass the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.\n\nDuring a call with reporters, a senior Biden campaign official said the gun control plan released by March For Our Lives, named the Peace Plan, is similar to Biden's.\n\n\"There are a lot of things in the peace plan that are also in this package that the [vice president] is putting forward...The [vice president] is very excited to work with the March for Our Lives students, and so many others all across the country who are building a grassroots movement to get gun legislation done,\" they said.", "description": ".10/02/2019 11:28:44AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/ea372bfa-9ed3-4293-a51a-fa1712a12657.png"}
