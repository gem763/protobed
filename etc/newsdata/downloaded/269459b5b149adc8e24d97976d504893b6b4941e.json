He pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud.\n\nIn addition to the jail time, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ordered Huneeus to pay a $100,000 fine and serve 500 hours of community service.\n\nProsecutors said he paid $100,000 to the scheme\u2019s ringleader, William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, to doctor his daughter\u2019s SAT score. Huneeus also was prepared to bribe the University of Southern California\u2019s athletic department to admit his daughter as a water polo player even though she didn\u2019t play the sport.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Justin O\u2019Connell said in a court filing that of all the parents implicated in the scandal, Huneeus\u2019 efforts were \u201ccalculated and carefully planned\u201d and he involved his daughter in carrying out the scheme.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset \u2026 Huneeus wanted to know exactly how the fraud worked, proposed ways to make it more effective, and demanded Singer\u2019s attention. He did all this while acknowledging to Singer that what they were doing was wrong, that the scheme could \u2018blow up in [his] face,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Connell wrote.\n\nHuneeus requested a two-month sentence, saying he\u2019s already paid enough for his crime because he lost his company, while prosecutors asked for 15 months. He stepped down as CEO of Huneeus Vintners in May.\n\nFifteen people, including Singer, have pleaded guilty to charges related to the Operation Varsity Blues scandal.\n\nOn Thursday, Talwani sentenced Manhattan lawyer Gordon Caplan to one month in prison, and ordered him to pay a $50,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Last month, actor Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison and 250 hours of community service in addition to being ordered to pay a $30,000 fine for paying $15,000 to fix her daughter\u2019s test scores. Los Angeles businessman Devin Sloane, 53, was sentenced to four months in prison, in addition, completing 500 hours of community service over two years and paying a $95,000 fine for paying $250,000 to get his son into the University of Southern California as a fake water polo recruit.", "description": "Oct. 4 (UPI) \u2014 A federal judge in Massachusetts sentenced a Napa Valley winemaker to five months in prison Friday for paying a $100,000 bribe to get", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
