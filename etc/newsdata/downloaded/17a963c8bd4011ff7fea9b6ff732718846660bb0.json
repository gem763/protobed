Instead, information about how to recover the plane never made it to the doomed crew.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\n31 pages are missing from the maintenance log of the Lion Air Boeing 737 Max plane from the month that it crashed into the sea and killed everyone on board, investigators said in their final report.\n\nThe report from Indonesian investigators was released on Friday, and pointed to Boeing's faulty design of the plane as well as compounding missteps from the airline and the pilots and crew on board the fatal flight, The Seattle Times reported.\n\nThe plane crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.\n\nThe report zeroed in on the design of Boeing's plane, noting flaws in its software system that continually pushed the plane's nose down, as well as how Boeing did not tell pilots about the system, did not notice that an alert in the plane was not working, and made the system more powerful without telling regulators.\n\nlion air plane crash More\n\nEddy Purwanto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nBut it also noted flaws in Lion Air's handling of the plane, including noting that 31 pages from the plane's maintenance logs for October 2018 \u2014 the month of the fatal crash \u2014 were missing. It is not known what happened to those pages.\n\nThe report pointed to the plane's previous flight, where passengers said that the plane climbed and dropped so much that it was \"like a rollercoaster,\" causing people to throw up.\n\nIt said that both flights displayed similar issues, and that Lion Air should have investigated after the problems on the fight flight.\n\nIt said that flight \"experienced multiple malfunctions was classified as a serious incident and should have been investigated.\"\n\nInstead, that information did not make it to the pilots of the second crash. Both crews were battling with the plane's nose repeatedly pointing down.\n\nLion Air declined to comment to Reuters about the report.\n\nA Bloomberg report in March, which cited unnamed investigative sources, said that an off-duty pilot riding in the cockpit diagnosed the problem and told the crew how to fix it, citing a checklist.\n\nBut the investigators said that the first officer on the second flight was not familiar with the checklist that he was supposed to run through, and had performed poorly in some training exercises with the airline.\n\nA voice recording that was recovered from the plane wreckage shows that the pilots were desperately reading the flight manual for a solution before the crash.\n\nLion Air JT610 More", "description": "Investigators' final report pointed to Boeing's design of the plane as well as compounding errors from Lion Air and the crew on the fatal flight.", "authors": ["Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GnFa5kDKyqoyzWh6lTA3rg--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/319d7bc5717bcefe94d2589ec42f2e85", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
