The restaurant has two robots which are rather oddly named 'Champa' and 'Chameli'.\n\nA civil engineer by profession, owner of Robo Chef Jeet Basa says, \"The robots work based on radar and don't have a specified path.\" Previously unveiled food delivery robots had pre-defined routes that it would take in order to complete certain tasks.\n\nHowever, this one is more dynamic in its approach and can dynamically shift routes depending on situations. According to Basa, they use SLAM or Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping that doesn't need any guided path. It is equipped with 17 kinds of sensors including proximity sensors, heat and smoke sensors.\n\nDon't Miss 111.7 K SHARES 24 K SHARES 28.6 K SHARES 12.5 K SHARES 5.1 K SHARES\n\nANI\n\nHe further added, \"They function as per the command and can speak any language, including Odia. They can also speak Odia and can wish our customers in Odia language.\"\n\nThe robots greet its guests in Odia stating, \"Apana mane khushi to?\" basically asking (Are you happy?). It allows humans to place an order with the help of touch-screen tablets on the front.\n\nANI\n\nChampa and Chameli are made in India and cost around Rs 5.5 lakhs each. Both have the ability to carry weights of up to 20 kilograms. They get charged up in around 30 minutes.\n\nIf you were wondering that these robots are going to make humans obsolete, there is still time for that as the restaurant owner states that even though Champa and Chameli are more than capable of taking food orders, he would assign his human staff to take orders, offering a human touch for a better experience.", "description": "We already know that Robots are taking over humans, in all walks of life across the globe and now a restaurant in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha has deployed robots to serve food and beverages to their guests.
