USA TODAY\n\nST. LOUIS \u2013 Daniel Hudson won\u2019t pitch Friday night in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series \u2013 a game that may or may not have required his services \u2013 and it\u2019s kind of a big deal that it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nHudson has been the Washington Nationals\u2019 most important relief pitcher in this postseason, locking down saves in the NL wild-card game and in Game 2 of the NL Division Series. Less than 48 hours ago, he pitched one of the most important single innings in Nationals postseason history \u2013 setting down the Dodgers on just one hit in Game 5\u2019s bottom of the ninth, keeping the game tied and enabling Howie Kendrick\u2019s historic grand slam to vault Washington into its first NLCS an inning later.\n\nIn the booze-fueled aftermath at Dodger Stadium, Hudson told reporters he\u2019d be heading to his Arizona home on the off day between series to be with his wife, Sara, who was due to give birth to their third child.\n\nAs children are prone to do, No. 3 didn\u2019t cooperate.\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said Friday, \u201cthe baby didn\u2019t want to come out until later on this morning.\u201d\n\nNationals closer has to postseason saves. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAnd so Hudson was placed on the paternity list, and the Nationals will go forth without him in the biggest game in franchise history (a designation that will apply for every game the remainder of this month).\n\nAnd somehow, the St. Louis Arch is still standing.\n\nMartinez fielded exactly one question on the matter before Game 1 and admittedly, it might have been different if Hudson were Juan Soto or Anthony Rendon or Max Scherzer on a day he was starting.\n\nAfter all, Hudson may not figure in this game. The Nationals could win 13-1 or they could lose 9-0 and Hudson wouldn\u2019t so much as taken off his jacket in the visiting bullpen.\n\nStill, the relative non-furor shows the world has come a long way from even 2014, when New York Mets infielder Daniel Murphy was pilloried by area talk show hosts \u2013 including former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason \u2013 for missing the Mets\u2019 first two games of the season as his wife gave birth.\n\nEsiason even went so far as to suggest Murphy should have strong-armed his wife into a C-section.\n\nYeah.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to miss him today,\u201d Martinez said, \u201cand he\u2019s going to try to get back here possibly tomorrow. But I told him, \u2018Hey, family\u2019s always first.\u2019 I mean, I get it, I understand.\n\n\u201cThe timing didn\u2019t work out like we thought, the baby wasn\u2019t ready to come out. So we get him back when we get him back.\u201d\n\nGiven that most major leaguers fall within the ages of 22 and 35, managers often find themselves tracking contractions as often as transactions, and Martinez is no different. The Nationals had quite a summertime baby boom, with Scherzer, Hunter Strickland and Brian Dozier all leaving the club to be with their families.\n\nNow\u2019s probably a good time to note that Hudson began the season a Toronto Blue Jay, and he and Sara could be forgiven if, nine months prior, they felt their calendar would be relatively clear come mid-October. But a July 31 trade to Washington thrust them into a pennant race and after getting through three elimination games, here they are, juggling an NLCS and a newborn.\n\nIt\u2019s a handy reminder that baseball isn\u2019t life, just a wonderful part of it -- unpredictable and unscripted and largely uncontrollable.\n\nFor Hudson, the two intersected at a wild yet wonderful time. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a blessing having a baby,\u201d Cardinals manager Mike Shildt said.\n\nSo, too, is competing for a World Series championship. That can wait.\n\nLife can\u2019t.", "description": "Nationals closer Daniel Hudson goes on paternity leave to start the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals -- a handy reminder that baseball isn\u2019t life.", "authors": ["Gabe Lacques", "Published P.M.
