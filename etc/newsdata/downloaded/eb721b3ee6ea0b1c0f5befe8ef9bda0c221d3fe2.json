Masculine adjectives included \u201cambitious\u201d and \u201chas leadership abilities\u201d; feminine adjectives included \u201cshy\u201d and \u201cchildlike\u201d.\n\nWomen were told to sit cross-legged and not to make face-to-face contact with men at work.\n\nThe presenter claimed women had smaller brains than men, a former EY executive director who wished to remain anonymous told HuffPost. She added that the presentation said women absorbed information \u201clike pancakes\u201d, making it hard for them to focus.\n\nThe presentation also had a breakdown describing differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s speaking styles, saying women ramble and \u201cmiss the point\u201d when they communicate and \u201cthink men hog air time\u201d.", "description": "The 55-page EY presentation also advised women to get manicures and not to address men face-to-face, according to media reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d85111a8c57ec2a67ff5028142c2f58c10d95938", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
