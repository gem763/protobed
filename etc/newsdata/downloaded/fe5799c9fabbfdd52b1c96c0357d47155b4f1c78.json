This new scheme is customer-centric and is looking to add value for them.'\n\nOne of the main changes in the scheme is that it will be app-based, which means only those with a smartphone are able to join.\n\nThe supermarket chain decided to do this in an effort to digitise the scheme \u2013 something Nectar has also recently decided to do.\n\nTherefore, when customers are looking to use their ten per cent off on a shop, they can scan the barcode on their Tesco Clubcard Plus app at the till. They decide when they want to use it and on what.\n\nTesco chief customer officer Alessandra Bellini said: 'We wanted to make it easier for the majority.\n\n'We found that with our current scheme, people forget their cards or fobs so putting it on a smartphone means it's something that everyone has with them all the time.'\n\nTesco Clubcard Plus customers will be able to access a range of different offers in-store\n\nSince the original Clubcard upgraded to digital in 2018, there has been an 'amazing uptake' from customers, Bellini claimed.\n\nHowever, consumers will be unable to use this offer retrospectively i.e. if they forget to scan at the till, they are unable to claim the discount again later.\n\nSome exemptions also apply including being unable to get 10 per cent offer when used in conjunction with other offers such as 25 per cent off six bottles of wine.\n\nHowever, it can be used on alcoholic purchases.\n\nAnother difference is that customers can only use the scheme in-store meaning those who have online deliveries are unable to access the same benefits.\n\nTesco do have a delivery saver plan, however, where customers pay monthly for cheaper next day deliveries which has the potential to be included in the Clubcard Plus scheme in the future.\n\nBritain's biggest supermarket said it could also work with other partners to give customers further savings in the future but its main focus is the in store bonuses for now.\n\nAs of now, 'drastic Dave' Lewis said that there was currently no uptake target and that the scheme was not being introduced in an effort to counteract competition for budget supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl.\n\nCustomers signed up will be able to cancel their subscription at any time and Tesco's original Clubcard scheme will continue as normal.\n\nClubcard Plus card holders will also still be able to gain points with their shops as they do with the standard Clubcard.\n\nTesco first launched Clubcard in 1995 and re-launched it in 2018 with contactless cards, an improved app and more rewards partners.\n\nOne concern for customers is the way that the supermarket uses their data - Tesco claims it uses the 'wealth of data' it has to make to sure that vouchers for customers are relevant as possible.\n\nLewis said that the data it collected showed every family shops about once a week but that every household is different in how much and what they buy.\n\nIt said the main way it uses customer data it collects from Clubcard users is to tailor further deals to their needs, for example, if it sees that someone is spending a lot on a certain item, it may then give that person a voucher towards that.", "description": "Tesco Mobile customers are likely to benefit the most from signing up to the service as they will also receive double data on their mobile phone contracts when joining.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
