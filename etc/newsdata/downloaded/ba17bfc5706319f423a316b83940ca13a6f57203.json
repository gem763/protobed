Customers who didn't have their payments processed, and were out of pocket over the weekend, were sent AU$50 from the bank as an apology.\n\nThe funds were transferred with \"Sorry from CBA\" as the transaction description.\n\nUp to 150,000 customers impacted are to expect the payment.\n\nCBA said that following the outage it has made significant progress in processing any outstanding payments.\n\n\"We now believe funds should be in customer accounts,\" the bank wrote in an update posted on Wednesday morning. \"If customers have any issues or questions regarding their payments they should contact our call centre or visit us in branch so we can assist.\n\nThe yellow bank said it is also refunding fees and charges associated to the network issue on Thursday for our customers who were impacted by this issue.\n\nAt the same time, the bank also issued a scam alert, saying that when contacting customers, it would not be asking for account details.\n\n\"If a customer is approached for their account details they should not provide this and the customer should let us know by phoning our call centre or visiting us in branch,\" the bank continued.\n\nThe bank on Thursday issued an apology to customers notifying them its systems were experiencing network issues.\n\nIt confirmed network issues had resulted in BPAY services, including PayID payments and cardless cash, being made unavailable, as well as some in-branch services, call centre services, CommBiz log on, and some CommBiz payments.\n\nIn addition, some debit card payments were affected, while the CommBank app and Netbank were still available, but with limited functionality.\n\nA small number of branches had also closed as a result of the network issue.\n\nIn a tweet on Monday morning, CBA said the \"large majority\" of outstanding payments would be completed and in customers' accounts mid-morning, after the outage stretched to the weekend.\n\n\"We apologise to everyone who has been affected by the delay in payments and we are very sorry for the inconvenience it has caused,\" CBA said again on Wednesday.\n\nFor the 2019 financial year, Commonwealth Bank reported AU$8.6 billion in statutory net profit after tax, slipping 8.1% from the AU$9.3 billion that was recorded a year prior.\n\nOperating expenses increased slightly for the bank by 2.5% to $11 billion. Of that amount, AU$1.9 billion was spent on information technology services, 8% more than FY18, primarily due to increased IT infrastructure costs, risk and compliance spend, and software license costs.\n\nMORE FROM THE YELLOW BANK", "description": "Only customers that didn't have payments processed over the weekend should expect the token.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/08/29/c87e9c76-ffeb-4ed1-954b-cfb90275d9b9/thumbnail/770x578/ddb489bc66099b08eb206c51f3a5bdeb/money-australia-50.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
