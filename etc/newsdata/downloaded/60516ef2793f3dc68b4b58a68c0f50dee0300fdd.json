Now we have to sell them.\u201d\n\nNot all of Hasankeyf\u2019s residents will have moved out by Tuesday\u2019s deadline and authorities will need to extend it, residents and activists say, further delaying the project that has faced numerous setbacks since it was launched more than 20 years ago.\n\nIn July, Turkey finally started to fill the dam further downstream on the Tigris where villages have already been vacated and are now partially submerged. Water is expected to start rising in Hasankeyf, located in the southeastern province of Batman, in the next few months.\n\nThe Ilisu Dam, expected to be operational for 50 years, will generate 1,200 megawatts of electricity, making it Turkey\u2019s fourth-largest dam in terms of energy production. But it has been criticized by activists who say the dam, once completely filled, will have displaced 78,000 people from 199 surrounding villages and risks creating water shortages downstream in Iraq.\n\nHasankeyf was used by the Romans as a fortress town to ward off Persians. The town was later destroyed by Mongols and rebuilt in the 11th century by Seljuk Turks.\n\nThe Ozturks\u2019 home is perched on a ledge on a cliffside. It has a clear view of works to construct a wall below the ancient Hasankeyf fortress, which dates back to the 4th century BC.\n\nBelow their home, archaeologists are working on a digging site, while above the wall, lie caves where people used to live.\n\nGeneral view of Hasankeyf, which will be significantly submerged by the Ilisu Dam, with the new Hasankeyf in the background, in the southeastern town of Hasankeyf, Turkey, October 3, 2019.

Parks and playgrounds for children have also been built and trees planted.\n\nIn a bid to attract tourists to the area, eight historic structures, including a massive tomb, an ancient Turkish bath, a historic mosque and its minaret, have been moved from the old town to Yeni Hasankeyf.\n\nThe head of the Hasankeyf Cultural Foundation, Ahmet Akdeniz - or Ahmet the Shepherd as he is known to locals - has moved into a house in Yeni Hasankeyf but remembers living in the caves as a child, sitting by a fireplace to eat and warm up, before people started moving to homes in the old town in the 1970s.\n\nAkdeniz, 52, supports the Yeni Hasankeyf project and believes it will increase tourism in the area.\n\nBut while the houses look pristine from the outside, they were made with low-quality building materials and residents have issues with the water supply, he said.\n\n\u201cWater is leaking everywhere except from the tap!\u201d he says.\n\nLONE RESIDENT\n\nSome people who have already moved to Yeni Hasankeyf have built coops outside their apartment buildings for their chickens, although the town is mostly empty and still under construction.\n\n\u201cWhat are we going to do without a job?\u201d says Cemil Yavanas, 57, as he carries disassembled wardrobes out of his house in Hasankeyf old town. He makes a living selling vegetables but will have no land once he moves to the new town.\n\nFurther down the Tigris River the village of Celikkoy, located 15 km (9.3 miles) north of the dam in the southeastern province of Mardin, is almost fully submerged by the rising waters.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nThe government started filling the dam in July without notifying anyone in advance, said Mehmet Selim Acar, 65, who has remained in Celikkoy, moving into a dilapidated former gendarmerie command post without electricity on a hill above the village.\n\nThe other residents have all left, but Acar, who also has an apartment in Batman, wanted to stay because his ancestors lived in the village. Since he retired from his job at a government office, he has made a living from agriculture.\n\n\u201cI had one ton of pomegranates, pears, 5-6 tonnes of grapes. I had to leave them,\u201d he said, recalling when his old home was flooded. \u201cThere was nowhere I could go to to file a complaint.\u201d", "description": "In the ancient Turkish town of Hasankeyf, the Ozturk family are selling all the livestock that was their livelihood as they prepare to uproot to government-built housing across the Tigris River before the waters rise.", "authors": ["Ali Kucukgocmen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438115747&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9616V", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
