Trump's betrayal of the Syrian Kurds over the past week is a moral travesty, but the Kurds have been betrayed by America before. What distinguishes this fiasco is its utter thoughtlessness, its disconnect from any strategic purpose, the sheer obviousness with which Trump allowed himself to be rolled by Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the inability of his advisers to salvage the situation before it led to war.\n\nThe constituent elements of the debacle \u2014 the blunder itself, the bluster and excuse-making afterward, our pretend-strongman president's transparent admiration for the foreign tough guy \u2014 were all exactly what Trump's campaign style led one to expect. So were the dead bodies, the refugees, the anger from allies, the glee from rivals. So was the message sent to those allies and rivals, to Riyadh and New Delhi and Jerusalem no less than Moscow and Beijing: that this US President can be easily hoodwinked and flattered and bullied, and the only repercussions will be Mike Pence showing up at your doorstep looking like a disappointed owl.\n\nEven from his most reliable supporters, the defences of Trump here have been strictly comparative. It's not as bad as the Iraq War/the Libya intervention/the Syrian civil war/the rise of ISIS. The foreign policy establishment is overreacting; far worse debacles happened on its watch.\n\nAnd there's some truth to this. Trump became president because the smart people in charge of US foreign policy failed in disastrous ways, and even after this past week his own failures haven't nearly matched their body count.\n\nBut the comparative defence only holds up until it doesn't. Maybe Erdogan's war can be contained, but maybe there's a regional conflict and a reconstituted ISIS downstream from this debacle \u2014 in which case Trump will have repeated the blunders of his predecessors, but with vastly less excuse.\n\nAnd even if this particular crisis stabilises, the decision-making approach that Trump used makes Kaiser Wilhelm look like a model of cool statesmanship, and its application in a crisis involving a real great power could be catastrophic. Nothing about these events supplies any confidence that his advisers can effectively direct him, or that the kind of advice available to him (see Rudy Giuliani, shadow secretary of state) won't keep on getting worse. Nothing about the relative calm of years one through three guarantees that the test isn't lurking in year four.\n\nOr in year five or six or seven, should Trump be re-elected. Which points us to the central issue for Republican-leaning voters and Republican senators alike. Both groups have grown used to Trump, in part because human beings grow used to all things, but in part because the most alarmist predictions, mine included, did not accurately describe his first two years in office.\n\nBut those voters and legislators have to ask themselves, at the polls in 2020 or sooner in a Senate trial, what seems more likely to predict Trump's governance going forward: The relatively restrained pattern of the McMaster-Mattis-Kelly period, or the unchecked impulses that just gave us death and betrayal and humiliation for no reason, none at all, save that our President is unfit for his job.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "The decision-making approach that Trump used to betray the Syrian Kurds makes Kaiser Wilhelm look like a model of cool statesmanship, and its application in a crisis involving a real great power could be catastrophic.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.468%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_543%2C$y_37/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cc39124c15fe076c70d832a9ac6ba82e6c3ad22d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
