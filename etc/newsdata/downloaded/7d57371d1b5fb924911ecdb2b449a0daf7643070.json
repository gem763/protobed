And Delhi during the festive time is a sight to behold. With its wide lanes lit up with glittering lights, and little shops selling diyas and lakshmi idols, the photographer in us has awakened.So, here we are, armed with our all new OPPO Reno2 Z, out and about in the city of 'dilwale' to gauge the level of enthusiasm for the festival which is at its peak.\n\nWe kicked off our festive trail with the Diwali Mela at Malviya Nagar in New Delhi. The colourful view of garlands hanging on the stalls could be seen from a distance too and click went our phone. With a 48 MP quad-camera setup OPPO Reno2 Z is a photographer\u2019s dream. In fact, with the 16MP front shooter it is the world's first pop-up camera with Bokeh Effect Video. We captured the smiles, the cheers and Diwali d\u00e9cor items in the mela. This HDR Ultra Dark mode click is as vibrant as the mood of the people at the mela.\n\nNext, we came across a Diwali favourite- Diyas, and once again we used the Ultra Dark mode on the OPPO Reno2 Z to capture the complete shot beautifully. It enhances the camera\u2019s photosensitivity beyond the naked eye and makes the low-light pictures easy to capture showcasing the diyas in its raw beauty.\n\nDozens of vendors were on the street selling clay diyas \u2013 from raw finished ones to painted diyas, we saw an array of options for the buyers in the market. The street was lit up with options galore. In fact, we spotted this girl, dedicated to her art, painting away the diyas at our next spot \u2013 Select City Mall.\n\nWe used the portrait mode 2.0 with bokeh effect on the OPPO Reno2 Z to capture her at work. Its portrait mode adjusts the level of blur before you can take the shot. Easy, isn\u2019t it? The sight at Select City was one for sore eyes. Nothing says Diwali like lit up corridors with dome backdrops.\n\nThere were electric diyas hanging around from the walls, making the mall a picturesque spot for the festive clicks. You now know where to head for Diwali shopping and get some new profile pictures while at it. To give you the complete picture of the Select City promenade, we took a wide angle shot with its 119\u00b0 wide angle lens on the OPPO Reno2 Z. See the lights? They\u2019ll remind you of home wherever you are this Diwali. We also managed to go to the busy market at Sadar Bazaar where the hustle and bustle of last minute Diwali shopping was at its peak. The streets were a sea of people and amidst all the chaos, we tried shooting a few videos using the bokeh mode on the front camera. It gave the video a perfect blog-style edit, perfect to go straight up on your Insta-story. We captured Dilliwali Diwali with the new OPPO Reno2 Z that comes with a 6.53- inch full HD + AMOLED display and an in-display fingerprint scanner. The smartphone has a notch-free display and sports a pop-up module for the selfie camera. It comes in a single variant of 8GB RAM and 256GB storage. The new OPPO Reno2 Z is perfect to capture your Diwali memories.\n\nOPPO is also giving an array of offers this festive season called \u201cOPPO\u2019s Big Diwali Big offers\u201d. Under which you get Complete Damage Protection, 10% cashback on HDFC debit/credit cards, zero down payment option from Bajaj Finserv and EMI options from IDFC First Bank, Home Credit & HDB Financial Services\n\nSo why wait! Grab your OPPO Reno2 Z!", "description": "There\u2019s a little less than a week to go for Diwali \u2013 the lights are up, the festivities are in full swing and the city of Delhi has transformed into the festive homeland of all the things bright and beautiful.
