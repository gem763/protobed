While that deal was exceptional, the royalties and boost to an artist\u2019s profile that use of their music in TV generates is significant at a time when physical sales of music are low.\n\nDespite being on the independent label Ninja Tune, the British electronic band the Cinematic Orchestra were one of the first acts to top the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s top TV songs chart more than once, with To Build a Home.\n\nNetflix's growth slows as it braces for influx of competition Read more\n\nThe track, which has been streamed almost 200m times on Spotify, hit the No 1 spot after appearing in Netflix\u2019s Orange is the New Black and then again after being featured in NBC\u2019s This is Us.\n\nNinja Tune is one of many labels to respond to the increasing demand from TV and other media by launching a division dedicated to production music.\n\nThe label\u2019s head of worldwide sync, Martin Dobson, said TV provided \u201ca robust income stream\u201d and it was only sensible for artists and labels to respond accordingly.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe internet has led to a proliferation in TV, film and other audio-visual output, accordingly there are more opportunities for music to be used. We are fortunate enough to have experienced the music of several artists, including the Cinematic Orchestra being used in artful and creatively sympathetic ways which have resulted in new interest \u2013 and when that happens it is almost immediately identifiable via streams, Shazams, social media and so on.\u201d\n\nIn the past, viewers hooked by a TV song had to hunt it down using their ingenuity. Now, apps such as Shazam and Tunefind, which is used in compilation of the TV songs chart, enable people to quickly identify a track and click straight through to purchasing or streaming platforms such as Spotify, YouTube and iTunes.\n\nAnother British artist to benefit is the soul singer Michael Kiwanuka, whose Love & Hate features on the acclaimed Netflix series When They See Us alongside another Cinematic Orchestra track, All Things to All Men.\n\nAfter Kiwanuka\u2019s track Cold Little Heart was the title track of HBO\u2019s Big Little Lies, he experienced a spike in his social media, his US tour dates sold out and the song remained in the Shazam Top 100 US chart for the entirety of the series. Such has been its impact that, in an interview with the Guardian, he was moved to amiably point out: \u201cI do have other music.\u201d\n\nPRS figures show the increase in music used has outstripped the rise in the number of programmes. While the number of programmes made available across major on-demand TV/film platforms has increased by 45% in the past five years, up from 147,000 to 212,500, the number of musical works featured rose 62%, from 488,500 to 789,500.\n\nAcknowledging the growing creative importance of TV soundtracks, the Emmys launched an outstanding music supervision award in 2017.\n\nThe music journalist Eamonn Forde said TV syndication was now \u201cpart and parcel\u201d of how music labels make money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely important as a form of revenue for published artists,\u201d he said. \u201cIf people aren\u2019t buying physical product, if they\u2019re relying on streams from Spotify, YouTube, this is another way to make money.\u201d\n\nThe hope for artists is they do not become known just for one track, but that this trend will encourage viewers to delve into their catalogue, he added.\n\nThe increase in music use on TV has also benefited composers, who write specifically for TV and other media, PRS said, with the royalties it has distributed to them increasing by 18% between 2017 and 2018, and a steady increase predicted over the next 10 years.", "description": "PRS says TV soundtracks on on-demand platforms have tripled in past five years", "authors": ["Haroon Siddique"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caf510226fac25ea81e955f4b4cd3bb827c04448/0_122_3599_2159/master/3599.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88a9a5f0845bbd6e5d506d798bac8ec9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
