REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File Photo\n\nIBM, which wrapped up its acquisition of Linux maker Red Hat Inc earlier this year, has faced years of revenue decline amid its shift to the cloud from its traditional businesses, including mainframe servers.\n\nSales from global technology services, IBM\u2019s biggest unit that caters to some of the world\u2019s largest data centers, were weighed down by lower client business volumes, mainly in the UK and Germany, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said on a post-earnings call.\n\nAfter a down-cycle, the company expects mainframe business to return to a normal product cycle in the fourth quarter, Kavanaugh told Reuters.\n\nRevenue from IBM\u2019s cloud services rose 11% to $5 billion, helping the company beat profit expectations for the quarter.\n\nTotal revenue fell 3.9% to $18.03 billion, missing analysts\u2019 average estimate of $18.22 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue dropped 0.6%.\n\nIBM\u2019s global technology services unit reported a 5.6% drop in revenue to $6.70 billion.\n\nCLOUD FOCUS\n\nChief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty, who has led IBM for more than seven years, is betting on subscription-based software offerings with the Red Hat deal, the company\u2019s biggest acquisition so far.\n\nHowever, IBM has said that it would report only a portion of Red Hat\u2019s actual revenue for some quarters, while recording all its expenses as required by U.S. accounting standards.\n\nThe cloud and cognitive software unit, which includes Red Hat, reported a 6.4% rise in revenue to $5.28 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\nNet income fell to $1.67 billion, or $1.87 per share, from $2.69 billion, or $2.94 per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding special items, the company earned $2.68 per share, 1 cent above analysts\u2019 estimate.\n\nThe Dow component\u2019s shares, which have gained about 25% this year, were down 5.4% at $134.44 in extended trading.", "description": "International Business Machines Corp missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday, as its global technology services unit was hit by weakness in some European markets, sending its shares down 5% in extended trading.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441646473&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F1VF", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
