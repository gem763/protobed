One of the more interesting panels was that of Ethereum\u2019s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin. Titled \u201cQ&A On Ethereum 2.0 With Vitalik,\u201d the discussion revolved around plenty of things concerning the future of the network, including scalability solutions.\n\nDiscussing one of the hottest trends in the past months, namely, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Buterin touched upon a matter which concerned plenty of people since back in 2017: the unacceptable number of scam Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).\n\nPublic Interest Projects: Appropriate Spin on ICOs\n\nICOs were a hot topic back in 2017 and throughout most of 2018. Yet, as it turned out, the majority of the projects failed to deliver on their promises and couldn\u2019t develop and deploy the product they raised money for. Hence, why a lot of people consider them to be rather scammy.\n\nCommenting on the matter, Vitalik Buterin proposed a solution made possible by the concept of decentralized finance \u2013 something that\u2019s been getting quite hot throughout the past few months.\n\nHe refers to the solution as \u201cpublic interest projects\u201d and gives the following explanation:\n\nWhat this is a spin on the ICO idea that I had one and a half years ago. So the idea is instead of projects having ICOs where people will just send them the money, and they, well, go away, you have a scheme where people put their tokens into a smart contract. [\u2026] The developers don\u2019t just have access to the tokens, they can\u2019t take them. Instead what happens is the money gets put in Compound, or some other interesting thing [\u2026] and then the interest goes to the developers.\n\nIn other words, instead of people blindly trusting a certain project, they\u2019d lock their tokens into a smart contract. That money will then be deployed into a DeFi solution which provides a certain interest rate and that\u2019s how the project will be funding its future endeavors.\n\nThe idea is rather interesting, mainly because it takes away the risk for investors. Since their money is locked in a smart contract, this eliminates the risk of the project running away \u201cin Indonesia or something,\u201d as Buterin said himself.\n\nThe Power of Decentralized Finance\n\nDecentralized Finance is perhaps one of the hottest topics among the crypto community throughout the past few months and it\u2019s catching speed fairly quickly.\n\nThe main concept is that traditional financial systems would leverage the decentralized nature of blockchain-based technologies, hence making said systems faster, cheaper, and, more importantly, globally accessible.\n\nCommenting on the matter live at Ethereal Summit in Tel Aviv, Buterin said:\n\nI\u2019m very excited about that DeFi offers in principal. The idea that anyone, anywhere in the world can just have access to a system that lets them pay each other [\u2026] and basically lets them choose their own financial exposure is very powerful to me. That\u2019s something that a lot of people just don\u2019t have access to.\n\nYet, Buterin also warned that people shouldn\u2019t be heavily encouraged to put their money in DeFi protocols mainly because they are still untested and have a non-zero chance of failure.\n\nBe the first to know about our price analysis, crypto news and trading tips: Follow us on Telegram or subscribe to our weekly newsletter.\n\n", "description": "The Ethereal Summit is currently taking place in Tel Aviv, Israel.
