Other major cryptocurrencies including ethereum <ETH=BTSP> and Ripple's XRP <XRP=BTSP> also soared.\n\nIn early London trading, bitcoin - the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization - was down 1.6% at $9,403.\n\nCryptocurrency exchanges are banned in China, though trading is popular on over-the-counter venues, and Chinese buyers account for major volumes on platforms elsewhere, market players say.\n\n\"The positive comments from the Chinese leader will continue to support the broader crypto prices to maintain at current levels, as China remains a major player when it comes to global crypto trading,\" said Andy Cheung, head of operations of OKEx, a Malta-based exchange popular among Chinese, in an email.\n\nChina-based Google searches for bitcoin and blockchain also spiked after Xi's comments, suggesting that the remarks had piqued intense interest in cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"There have definitely been more conversations since the weekend,\" said Anthony Wong of Hong Kong-based crypto investment firm Orichal Partners.\n\nBitcoin has slumped in recent months as politicians and regulators across the world have criticized Facebook's planned Libra cryptocurrency. It had lost a third since it touched its highest this year in June on hopes that Libra would hasten the mainstream acceptance of virtual coins.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Tom Wilson; Editing by Alison Williams)", "description": "Bitcoin held ground on Monday near a one-month high scaled over the weekend after China's president Xi Jinping said the world's second biggest economy should accelerate the development of blockchain technology.
