As wireless adoption slowed, T needed to significantly move the needle to continue making investors happy. Unfortunately, it may be having the opposite effect on AT&T stock.\n\nElliott Management May Be Right About AT&T Stock More\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter struggling to integrate Time Warner into its system, never realizing the full potential of bundling as well as a few other missteps, T stock has now become the target of some very angry shareholders. That includes activist investors at Elliott Management\n\nAnd Elliott may have a point.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAT&T\u2019s big plans haven\u2019t come to fruition and they may never. Considering the debt that AT&T is now ladled with, it might be time to cut losses and run. For investors, AT&T stock may not be the risk-free investment they think it is. Elliott\u2019s involvement brings many of its issues to the forefront.\n\nAT&T\u2019s Big Moves Aren\u2019t Working\n\nAfter the growth of the wireless boom slowed to trickle and fungibility among carriers resulted in a price war, AT&T was caught between a rock and hard place.\n\nOwners of AT&T had grown accustomed to getting some \u201coomph\u201d with their investment. The firm couldn\u2019t go back to being a boring widow and orphan stock. So, as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) went the web route and T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) began snagging up weaker rivals, AT&T decided to copy the creator/distributor model that worked for several other cable providers.\n\nThe company set itself to be an all-in-one media and content provider. It would make the movies and then distribute them over its satellite and mobile video operations.\n\nThe problem is, while this worked for Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), it really hasn\u2019t worked so well for AT&T.\n\nIt turns out, providing cable TV services is just as fungible as wireless service. People continue to cut the cord at a fevered pace and adopt streaming instead. For AT&T\u2019s, DirecTV this has resulted in the fleeing of subscribers. The same could be said for T\u2019s U-Verse traditional cable service.\n\nWhen AT&T first purchased DirecTV, it had 20.3 million US customers. Adding in U-verse brings the total to 26 million. After AT&T reported earnings in the second quarter, that number had dipped to just 21.6 million. That\u2019s a 17% drop since the DirecTV buyout.\n\nWhoops.\n\nThis is a huge issue if your entire future is based on getting people to watch your produced movies and T.V. shows on your exclusive networks. With people fleeing AT&T\u2019s distribution platform, the big buyout of Time Warner starts to make less sense. It can\u2019t just offer that content to its subscribers because there are no subscribers left. In order to justify the purchase of Time Warner, you have to lose the exclusivity. And once you do that, the model is broken.\n\nAT&T Gets a Letter From Elliott\n\nAll of this brings us to Paul Singer and Elliott Management. The activist shop disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in the firm and sent a strongly worded letter to AT&T\u2019s management indicating that its recent blunders have hurt shareholders.\n\nIn its letter, Elliott partner Jesse Cohn and associate portfolio manager Marc Steinberg wrote that AT&T should sell some of its non-core businesses such as its Mexican wireless operations. More importantly, it should cut DirecTV loose either via a spin-out or asset sale. Likewise, AT&T needs to focus on being more profitable and generate more revenue per employee. Something rival Verizon does well. Also on the menu was increased buyback and dividend programs.\n\nIf management at AT&T complied and work with Elliott\u2019s suggestions, AT&T stock could be worth north of $60 per share by 2021. That would be a roughly 65% gain from recent closing prices.", "description": "When you're a big company, you need to think big in order to keep on growing.
