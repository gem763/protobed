Two men in the Southern California town who claimed to be running a hedge fund had taken $75,000 from him, he said, and then promptly lost it all. The tipster later killed himself.\n\nBut his claim helped spark a three-year investigation that has now resulted in a felony charge against both men \u2014 one of whom, Jacob Wohl, has since become a headline-generating conservative activist and conspiracy theorist.\n\nWohl, 21, appeared in court on Wednesday and now faces arraignment in October for one count of selling an unregistered security, as first reported by the Daily Beast. He didn\u2019t immediately return a message late Wednesday.\n\nThe criminal case is the latest turn in a whiplash career that has seen Wohl transform from a stock-trading wunderkind (later banned from an industry group) to a President Trump-backing Twitter figure (later booted off the platform) to the activist behind botched attempts to smear former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with fabricated sexual assault claims.\n\n[Meet the GOP operatives who aim to smear the 2020 Democrats \u2014 but keep bungling it]\n\nWohl\u2019s new legal troubles date back to a series of firms he ran with a partner named Matthew Johnson. Riverside prosecutors began looking into the pair in June 2016 following the complaint from the Arizona man, who is identified only as \u201cDavid\u201d in court documents.\n\nIn July 2016, a senior investigator with the Riverside County District Attorney\u2019s Office contacted Wohl\u2019s firm, Montgomery Assets, posing as a real estate agent representing an investor. Montgomery Assets purported to invest in \u201creal estate, hedge funds,\u201d and \u201cprivate equity,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nAfter chatting with Johnson and Wohl for about a month, the investigator and an undercover Riverside Police detective set up a deal to invest $100,000 in a fund that supposedly bought and flipped derelict houses for a profit. They were promised a 17 percent return in a year, according to court documents.\n\nAbout a month later, the Arizona Corporation Commission sent Wohl a cease-and-desist order, noting that Montgomery Assets misrepresented its \u201csize, the experience of its employees, and the risk\u201d of its investments. Wohl agreed to a $5,000 fine and $32,000 in restitution in that case \u2014 neither of which he had paid as of last June, reported The Washington Post\u2019s Manuel Roig-Franzia and Beth Reinhard.\n\n[Twitter suspends far-right activist Jacob Wohl for creating accounts to allegedly manipulate the U.S. presidential election]\n\nWohl defended his business practices at the time, telling The Post that the lack of criminal charges or lawsuits \u201care good indications I\u2019ve never done anything wrong.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, Wohl made a name for himself, first as an ardent Trump supporter and then as a dirty trickster who openly aimed to sully the reputations of those he saw as the president\u2019s enemies.\n\nLate last year, Wohl and lobbyist Jack Burkman called a news conference and promised testimony from a woman who would claim Mueller had raped her; the woman never showed and Mueller asked the FBI to probe whether the pair offered her money. (They deny doing so.) In April, they gathered reporters again, this time to level sexual assault claims against Buttigieg \u2014 even though the supposed victim had already recanted and said he was pressured into making the false claim.\n\nWohl also authored a document, reported by the Daily Beast, suggesting raising $1 million to put out false information about Democratic candidates to swing betting markets.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why California prosecutors waited to file charges, though the case\u2019s three-year statute of limitations was nearly up, according to The Daily Beast.\n\nIn court documents, prosecutors say the $100,000 deal \u201cappeared to be an offer to sell a security\u201d by Wohl and Johnson, and that the security wasn\u2019t qualified with the California Department of Business Oversight as state law requires.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from court documents if either Wohl \u2014 who lists a current residence in the nearby town of Corona, Calif. \u2014 or Johnson have an attorney yet.", "description": "Wohl faces the charges in California over a company he ran in 2016.", "authors": ["Tim Elfrink", "Editor Of The Morning Mix", "September At Am", "Tim Elfrink Joined The Washington Post In He'S The Editor Of Morning Mix."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BQAvcpLYSsgeDfPdeyDoycSFVio=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TOWM7PUDWZAAHLFFQD6UO5ADZQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
