Not far behind is the childlike innocence His Holiness the Dalai Lama retains in the twinkle of his eyes. He is not averse to going the extra mile just to see you crack a smile \u2013 even if it means pulling a funny face!\n\nWhen he stepped in to meet us, Dalai Lama had just spent his morning greeting the many people who come to catch a glimpse of the God in exile, the supporter of Tibetans. They prostrate themselves before him, bow, touch his feet, kiss his hands; some cling to him and burst into tears. He calmly meets all, speaks words of hope and wisdom, smiles and chuckles, intent on sending back all smiling.\n\nHe walks in unaided to greet us as we wait at his residence in McLeod Ganj. His first words after the initial greetings are, \u201cI am a great supporter of ahimsa and karuna \u2014 this is the tradition of India. I like to spread this message not through religion, but with the help of analysis and science. It all has to be logical.\u201d After a pause, \u201cYou have to be peaceful. And peace comes through non-violence and compassion!\u201d\n\nJust as I start to ask a question, he continues, \u201cCompassion is a very important virtue. We are all social animals. So we live together and take hope and courage from each other. Animals stop at that, but humans have to do more than that. Promote peace. Stay positive and hopeful. Protect the environment.\u201d\n\nA pause, but understanding he has more to say, I stay quiet. Dalai Lama continues, \u201cI believe in the oneness of 7 billion people. We are all one. Problems arise when we start thinking \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018them.\u2019\u201d Smiling he looks at us and waits now.\n\nI ask him a question that has bothered me consistently.\n\n\u201cYour Holiness, should compassion and forgiveness extend to evil also?\u201d\n\nDalai Lama says, \u201cWhat is evil? There is no evil in a child. As they grow up, our attitudes make people evil or terrorists. Compassion and understanding can take care of all. You change your attitude towards people and they will also become different. Be compassionate towards enemies.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cLike China and we Tibetans -\u2013 we have to ultimately all live together as brothers and sisters; why be enemies?\u201d Pausing he allows a naughty twinkle to settle in his eyes and adds with a chuckle, \u201cFight occasionally!\u201d\n\nWhat is the significance of a positive attitude?\n\n\u201cHope is everything. It is important to keep people positive and looking forward.\u201d His Holiness, despite his description of himself as \u201ca wise monk on a peaceful journey in search of self-enlightenment\u201d occasionally allows his irrepressible humour and honesty to get the better of him. And so he takes his habitual dig at the US President Donald Trump, \u201cNot like Trump. Every morning something bad!\u201d Chuckle. He wags a finger at us.\n\nNext I ask His Holiness if he has achieved inner peace? He responds with a faraway look, \u201cEveryone who meets me goes back smiling. I always smile at everyone. I love teasing people. People don\u2019t believe my age \u2013 look at my teeth, my lips, my face (he displays all). This is because of inner peace. I believe in Bodhicitta (altruism)\u2013 the goodness in all human beings. You must work on yourself. Change your attitude.\n\n\u201cI am not afraid of anyone because whether friend, foe or demon, I see a brother or a sister in everyone. If you are scared of anyone, put up my photo and they will run away!\u201d Of course he chuckles here!\n\nHow are we different from the 80s and 90s? \u201cThe world has matured with suffering. Look at the European Union. If EU had not been formed, all these European countries would have been fighting with each other. But now they are one and there is no question of war. After the suffering in the two World Wars, they have learnt their lesson.\n\nWhat is the purpose of life? \u201cTo achieve peace and happiness,\u201d says the Dalai Lama without hesitation. But not just for yourself, spread peace amongst humanity and for your country too. That is all part of you. Conversations and debates help. Debate with others and with your own self to understand and analyse.\n\nAs we talked to the Dalai Lama, a fog had spread across the monastery, swirling through the corridors of the main temple. We take our leave and as we circumambulate the monastery and emerge, we see the fog has dissipated as mysteriously as it appeared.\n\nRespond to vinita.nangia@timesgroup.com", "description": "His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama stresses the importance of cultivating inner peace and staying positive and hopeful at an informal meeting His chuckle is most endearing.
