No Labour MP could be fooled by Boris surely?!\u2019\n\nBut three hours in, it appeared she may have started to flag as many of the 650 MPs had their say on the subject.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nSadly the eyes of Twitter were upon her, with many people taking to social media to berate the timing of her alleged snooze.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKieran_S tweeted: \u2018Diane Abbott is asleep during this very important day.\n\n\u2018I guess she couldn\u2019t face having to work her first Saturday ever.\n\n\u2018Not to worry, she makes more sense when she is asleep.\u2019\n\nDylan Pemberton said: \u2018Unbelievable. Utter disrespect for the voters.\u2019\n\nAlan Woodward questioned whether falling asleep at work was a sackable offence.\n\nBut a few came to her defence with Milk Media saying: \u2018To be fair to Diane Abbot, I\u2019d probably be asleep as well.\u2019\n\nOff to Parliament today to vote against Boris Johnson\u2019s bad Brexit deal.
