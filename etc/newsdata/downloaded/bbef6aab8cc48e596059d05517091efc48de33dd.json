It\u2019s no secret that the company is finding it hard to draw more users to its main social network, its so-called \u201cbig blue app.\u201d\n\nThe number of daily users of the Facebook social network and FB Messenger app increased to 1.6 billion people in the second quarter, growing 8% from the year ago period. That rate was the second-slowest in the company\u2019s history.\n\nIn Europe, the U.S. and Canada \u2014 which together generate about three-fourths of Facebook\u2019s quarterly revenue \u2014 user numbers haven\u2019t changed for about two years.\n\nThis slowdown hasn\u2019t yet meaningfully impacted sales, but it could at some point if CEO Mark Zuckerberg doesn\u2019t show any progress in monetizing Facebook's other social media assets, such as Instagram and WhatsApp. Fortunately, there are clear signs that Zuckerberg\u2019s plan to diversify the company\u2019s revenue base is well on track.\n\nUpbeat Earnings Forecasts\n\nWhile growth at the main Facebook app has slowed, the company is still adding users rapidly on other properties. A total of 2.7 billion people use at least one Facebook-owned app \u2014 Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or FB Messenger \u2014 every month, making it the world\u2019s largest social network.\n\nEncouraged by this growth strategy, analysts have generally upbeat forecasts for the company\u2019s revenue and profit. Facebook will likely report $17.36 billion in sales tomorrow, a surge of about 26% when compared to the same period a year ago, according to analysts\u2019 consensus forecast. Profit per share is seen rising 8% to $1.9 vs $1.46 in the year-earlier period.\n\nFacebook Weekly Chart\n\nThat said, the challenges for Facebook are pretty daunting. It\u2019s one of the top technology companies facing multiple regulatory probes focused on the monopolistic power of its platform, potential for misuse and the company\u2019s data practices.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is carrying out an antitrust probe of Facebook, while the Federal Trade Commission is also undertaking a separate investigation into antitrust issues. Last week, the New York Attorney General Letitia James announced that 45 states \u2014 plus Guam and the District of Columbia \u2014 are investigating whether the company harmed competition.\n\nThe fear of regulatory actions has kept Facebook shares under pressure over the past three months. At Monday's close, the stock was trading at $189.4, down about 5% since the end of July. But another blowout quarter, in our view, will be enough to again power up the stock, which this summer was flirting with another record high.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGoing forward, there's no guarantee the challenges for the world\u2019s largest social media platform will disappear. In the latest conference call with analysts in July, the company\u2019s chief financial officer warned that Facebook\u2019s slowdown in revenue growth could extend beyond this year, as growing limitations on how much personal data Facebook can collect and use for ads will make it tough to make money through advertising sales.\n\nDespite this tough operating environment and the company\u2019s cautionary tone, the reality is that there is no other platform as powerful nor as global as Facebook is. We don\u2019t believe that that power is diminishing, which is one of the main reasons we continue to like Facebook stock despite the ups and downs.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Facebook Inc.
