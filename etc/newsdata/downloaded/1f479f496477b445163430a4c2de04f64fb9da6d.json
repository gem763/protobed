I just wondered why the BBC was trying to make us angry with a show we adore.\n\nThen we had tough guy actor Danny Dyer talking cockney and balls as a game show host on BBC1\u2019s The Wall.\n\nDyer\u2019s approach to presenting appeared to be that shouting and posturing is a substitute for drama. You can take the man out of EastEnders, etc.\n\nHowever, in terms of outright randomness, nothing came close to what Simon Cowell gave us on ITV.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAs far as I could tell, he had invited a load of famous mates \u2013 and Sinitta \u2013 to an LA garden party so they could all gawp at some unfamiliar faces doing karaoke by the water feature.\n\nThis was The X Factor: Celebrity.
