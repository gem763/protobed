Bob Menendez (D-NJ) is demanding answers from Facebook about anti-vaccination ads in response to a Daily Beast report that found the social network was removing some pro-vaccine ads from hospitals and health departments while allowing a selection of anti-vaxx ads to spread conspiracy theories unimpeded.\n\nMenendez blasted the company on social media Tuesday. He tweeted a link to The Daily Beast story and wrote, \u201cSeriously??? Facebook said it was cracking down on #AntiVax ads, but clearly hasn\u2019t stuck to its word.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times do we need to repeat it? Vaccines work! Whether it\u2019s an advertisement, a page, or a group, @facebook needs to take action to curb this dangerous misinformation\u2026ASAP,\u201d he added.\n\nThe social networking company plans to brief Menendez on the issue, Politico reported.\n\nFacebook instituted stricter policies prohibiting vaccine misinformation on its site in March, but instead of eradicating conspiracy theorists and hucksters, that crackdown appears to be penalizing legitimate healthcare providers. In October, the social network\u2019s ad review flagged and removed 14 ads from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare promoting the agency\u2019s free pediatric vaccination program.\n\nAt the same time, the anti-vaxx nonprofit Children's Health Defense ran more than 10 ads promoting medical conspiracy theories like the \u201cMMR Poison Pill,\u201d the idea that the common mumps, measles, and rubella vaccine contains deadly allergens. A Facebook spokesperson called the removal a mistake and said the health department\u2019s ads had been reinstated after an inquiry from The Daily Beast.\n\nThe contradiction has frustrated healthcare providers. A spokesperson for the Minnesota Hospital Network, which regularly has ads advocating for vaccination taken down, told The Daily Beast the organization expects to upload ads multiple times because of the \u201cmoving target\u201d of Facebook\u2019s advertising policies.\n\nMenendez\u2019s criticism isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has become entangled in vaccine-related controversies. Anti-vaxx groups use the platform to fundraise, recruit new members, and share potentially deadly autism \u201ccures.\u201d Rep. Bill Posey (R-FL) berated Mark Zuckerberg in a congressional hearing October 23 about the social network\u2019s stance on vaccine misinformation. Zuckerberg defended the company, citing scientific consensus that vaccines are safe, and Posey accused him of bias.\n\nThe United States is in the midst of its worst outbreak of vaccine-preventable diseases in decades and may lose its designation as a nation that has eliminated measles as a result. The World Health Organization named anti-vaccine backlash one of the top 10 threats to global health in 2019.\n\nFacebook and Menendez\u2019s office did not provide comment.\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct that the anti-vaccination organization that ran the ads is Children's Health Defense\u2014not the Children\u2019s Defense Fund, which is a strong supporter of vaccines for children.", "description": "New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez believes that Facebook \u201cclearly hasn\u2019t stuck to its word\" when it comes to cracking down on the dangerous strain of health misinformation.", "authors": ["Blake Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2700,w_4800,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572461540/191030-Montgomery-Senator-Facebook-Vaccine_p8awau", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
