You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLet her tell it: \u201cIn this time of crisis in our politics, it is not surprising that those who are dedicated to defeating Donald Trump are organizing in every way permitted by current law to bring an end to his disastrous presidency.\u201d\n\nAnd then, of course, this line: \u201cNothing changes unless we defeat Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBedingfield\u2019s choice of words belies the true motivation of this shift: it is not borne out of strategy, but necessity. And much like the man he seeks to replace, Joe Biden is faulting someone else for his decision to flip-flop.\n\nBiden was correct when he previously opined about the ills of super PACs. During an appearance on PBS NewsHour in 2018, he claimed to have told Bernie Sanders not to create a super PAC during his 2016 run. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that told him, you shouldn\u2019t accept any money from a super PAC, because people can\u2019t possibly trust you. How will a middle-class guy accept you if you accept [that] money?\u201d he said.\n\nYes, how will they, \u201cMiddle Class Joe?\u201d\n\nBut it seems that the Biden campaign is cash-strapped, reportedly entering the month of October with only $9 million in the bank \u2014 far less than many of his leading rivals. Although he is drawing more money from rich donors than any other candidate, Biden lags significantly behind his competitors in terms of individual donors.\n\nIn reaction to Uncle Joe\u2019s pleas for the plutocrats to save his fledgling operation, Faiz Shakir, Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said via statement: \"Let\u2019s be clear, super PACs exist for one reason and one reason only: to help billionaires and corporations bankroll a presidential campaign with unlimited amounts of money, in exchange for favors. Every Democratic candidate should forcefully reject any help from super PACs \u2014and they should tell their supporters and surrogates to stop engaging with super PACs that aim to buy elections and undermine our democracy.\u201d\n\nAlthough she didn\u2019t cite Biden by name, Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that any Democratic candidate would reverse course and endorse the use of unlimited contributions from the wealthy to run against fellow Democrats. A handful of wealthy donors should not be allowed to buy the Democratic nomination. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n\nAlthough Biden may be burning cash on private jets, select national polls point to the enduring affinity Democratic voters have with him. Nevertheless, his inability to produce the sort of campaign that inspires and resonates with the masses speaks to what\u2019s always been his larger issue: he has never been good at running for president. People can imagine Joe Biden as president, sure\u2014 but merely looking presidential in the media won\u2019t get people fired up. And if you can\u2019t get fired up, you are using that extra cash on something like a pedicure (because you deserve it) and not Biden\u2019s stumbling bid for the presidency.\n\nThe campaign is going so badly that there are now reports of the Democrat donor class experiencing enough anxiety to think about putting up other candidates. It\u2019s early in the race, after all, and maybe Joe isn\u2019t going to make it. Folks like Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Michael Bloomberg, Eric Holder, Deval Patrick and Sherrod Brown are apparently considering jumping in. To which I say: please, just leave us alone.\n\nWho wants to endure another Trump-versus-Clinton campaign? Doesn\u2019t that sound so painful? Let Hillary spend her time trolling Republicans (because she deserves that).\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Oh, and Deval Patrick, you worked at Bain capital and served as former governor of Massachusetts: you know better. Lastly, while Sherrod Brown may well have performed well in the primary, it\u2019s late October, so both he and another intriguing figure, Eric Holder, missed the boat.\n\nWhat all of them \u2014 the pundits, the donor class, the moderates \u2014 need to accept is that Joe Biden was never the be-all, end-all candidate. Any one of those candidates running could beat Trump and just about all of them \u2014 including Biden \u2014 could be beaten by Trump. The issue is finding the kind of candidate that inspires voters to the point where they feel compelled to engage. Once you get over your Joe Biden/old white guy centrist kink and take a look around, you\u2019ll see there are already candidates across the country who are able to do that.", "description": "In a recent statement, Joe Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, cited the behavior of President Donald Trump and his allies for their reason to reverse a self-imposed ban on accepting help from a super PAC.", "authors": ["Michael Arceneaux"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/08/urn-publicid-ap.org-dd58bda588fc4d22a6a24c3eefd0f89d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
