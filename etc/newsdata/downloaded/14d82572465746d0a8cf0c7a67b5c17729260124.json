REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nThe freestyle wrestler was one of India\u2019s few gold medal hopes in Rio and the entire nation mourned as she lay on the mat writhing in pain during her bout against China\u2019s Sun Yanan.\n\nStill rankled by the nightmare, the 25-year-old has secured herself another shot at Olympic glory at next year\u2019s Tokyo Games after winning a bronze medal at the recent world championships at Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan.\n\n\u201cI can never forget that injury. Actually every time I go on the mat for a match, that injury motivates me to win,\u201d Phogat, who last year became the country\u2019s first woman wrestler to win an Asian Games gold, told Reuters in an interview.\n\n\u201cWhatever the competition, whoever the opponent, I keep telling myself I have to get out of here as a winner.\u201d\n\nHaving added a world championship medal to her collection, the twice Commonwealth Games gold medallist believes Tokyo will be her best chance of Olympic success.\n\n\u201cAfter the injury I am going back to the same stage, so it is big for me,\u201d she said by phone. \u201cEvery athlete has a peak time, I think I am at my peak right now. I have to take advantage of this phase and achieve the best that I can.\n\n\u201cI want to go back to the world championships and turn this medal (bronze) into gold and be a world champion. But my entire attention is now on Tokyo and I want to do well there.\u201d\n\nMonths before the Rio Games, Phogat was thrown out of an Olympic qualifying tournament for being 400 grams overweight for the 48kg class.\n\nThis time, however, she has confirmed her berth well in advance which will allow her to focus solely on Tokyo.\n\nNEW WEIGHT\n\nShe especially needed to free herself of qualification worries having moved up to the 53 kilogram class after winning her Commonwealth and Asian Games medals in the 50kg.\n\nPhogat was finding the process of losing weight before a competition difficult but it still needed a lot of convincing from her coaches before she agreed to move up.\n\n\u201cThe strength levels, techniques in the higher weight category are totally different,\u201d she said. \u201cI had competed for four-five years in the 50kg category so I was used to that and knew my opponents.\n\n\u201cNext one year I will concentrate on the top opponents in my category and train to beat them in Tokyo.\u201d\n\nPhogat hails from the conservative state of Haryana, which is infamous for high rate of violence against women in the country.\n\nHer cousins Geeta and Babita are former Commonwealth Games champions and their extraordinary success inspired a 2016 movie \u201cDangal\u201d which went on to become the all-time highest grossing Bollywood film.\n\nFILE PHOTO: 2016 Rio Olympics - Wrestling - Quarterfinal - Women's Freestyle 48 kg Quarterfinal - Carioca Arena 2 - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 17/08/2016.
