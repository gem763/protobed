I care about corruption,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Trump said he had spoken with Republican Senate Mitch McConnell and seen his statement that he saw nothing wrong in the president\u2019s call with the leader of Ukraine. As a result, he said, he believed he would be supported by Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThis week, in a rare televise interview, Mr McConnell told CNBC that Congressional rules would require the Senate to consider an impeachment vote if the House passed such a censure. Yet, he said there was no requirement as to how much time was dedicated to it.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to do is spend our time accomplishing things for the American people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey spent the last three years harassing this president and I gather we\u2019re going to get another chapter of that with the impeachment episode. But we need to find other things that actually make a difference for the American people and accomplish as much as we can,\u201d he said.\n\n", "description": "Donald Trump has for the time admitted that Democrats in the House of Representatives have enough votes to \u201ceasily\u201d impeach him.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/12/trump-admits.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
