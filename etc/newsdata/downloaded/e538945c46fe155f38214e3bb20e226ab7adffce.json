The focus of the book is Farrow\u2019s ultimately successful attempts to report on Harvey Weinstein. NBC News is part of that story because, according to Farrow, NBC told him to stop reporting, forcing him to take the story to the New Yorker which published it weeks later. That decision to try to quash the story that helped launch the #MeToo movement and won Farrow a Pulitzer Prize isn\u2019t looking too good for NBC in retrospect. In addition, a portion of the new book deals with disgraced NBC News anchor Matt Lauer. Farrow claims that NBC executives were aware of Lauer\u2019s behavior well before he was finally fired.\n\nToday, before the book is even released, NBC News president Noah Oppenheim released a lengthy memo trashing the book. Oppenheim calls it a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d and says Farrow is twisting the facts \u201cinto a lie.\u201d Fox News got a copy of the memo which was sent out this morning. Here\u2019s a sample:\n\nMatt Lauer\u2019s actions were abhorrent, and the anger and sadness he caused continue to this day. As we\u2019ve said since the moment he was fired, his abuses should never have happened. Ronan Farrow\u2019s book takes that undeniable fact and twists it into a lie \u2013 alleging we were a \u201ccompany with a lot of secrets.\u201d We have no secrets and nothing to hide. Now that we\u2019ve read Farrow\u2019s book, it\u2019s clear \u2013 his smear rests on the allegation that NBC\u2019s management knew about and took steps to hide Matt Lauer\u2019s misconduct before his firing in November of 2017. Without that, he has no basis on which to rest his second conspiracy theory \u2014 that his Harvey Weinstein reporting was squashed to protect Lauer.\n\nThe memo then reviews three claims that women had complained about Lauer\u2019s behavior years prior to his firing. One of these claims involves Ann Curry:\n\nA woman who is named in the book. Farrow says she disclosed her allegation to Ann Curry in 2010, and asked her not to share it. Curry says she then told two executives \u2013 both of whom are no longer with the company \u2013 that Lauer \u201chad a problem with women.\u201d By her own account, Curry relayed no specific complaint, nor did she say Lauer\u2019s \u201cproblem\u201d regarded any specific workplace misconduct. NBCU was able to speak with one of those former executives during the 2018 review and she denied having been told even this. At the time of the employee\u2019s exit, three years later, she still had made no complaint about Lauer, was paid 22 weeks of severance based on her years of service, and was asked to sign a separation agreement that was standard for departing employees at the time. The standard separation agreement included a routine confidentiality clause that was designed to protect proprietary company information. It was not drafted to prevent an employee from reporting misconduct, and it has never been used that way. (This employee made a complaint to management about Lauer, for the first time, after his 2017 firing.)\n\nAfter two similar paragraphs about other women, the memo states: \u201cI feel absolutely terrible that these three employees were subjected to Matt Lauer\u2019s horrific behavior, but the facts do not support Farrow\u2019s allegation of a \u201ccover-up\u201d, and he offers no further evidence.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s my take and then we\u2019ll get to Farrow\u2019s response. NBC claims that a) one of the executives denied hearing this in 2010 and b) Curry didn\u2019t give details about what misconduct was involved. But notice that NBC isn\u2019t outright denying that something might have been said to executives about Matt Lauer.\n\nThe problem with NBC\u2019s take is that it suggests executives had no responsibility (or ability?) to investigate Lauer on their own. They were handcuffed and unable to act because the complaint they heard wasn\u2019t specific enough. That smells like defensive corporate BS to me. Maybe the complaint was a bit vague, but \u201ca problem with women\u201d isn\u2019t really that hard to parse in the context of an office setting. Put it this way, if a source had told an NBC reporter that someone they were investigating had \u201ca problem with women\u201d they would know what it meant. And this wasn\u2019t coming from some clerk-typist, it was coming from one of their big on-air stars. NBC could easily have looked into the complaint and found some damaging information about Lauer. They didn\u2019t look because they didn\u2019t want to know. As Fox News points out, the person in charge at the time is currently the head of CNN:\n\nCurrent CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker was the executive producer of \u201cToday\u201d when Lauer was hired in 1994 and had oversight of the morning show anchor while in various roles until leaving NBC in 2010. Zucker has denied knowledge of Lauer\u2019s alleged misconduct.\n\nFarrow has responded to the memo in general terms at least twice today, first at CBS News and later on the View. Here\u2019s his full CBS interview. I\u2019m skipping forward to the part where the NBC memo is introduced:\n\nHere\u2019s his appearance on The View where he discussed the memo and NBC\u2019s denials:", "description": "\"his smear rests on the allegation that NBC\u2019s management knew...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Ronan-Farrow.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
