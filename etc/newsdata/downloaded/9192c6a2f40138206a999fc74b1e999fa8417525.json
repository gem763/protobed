I just hope that, at the end of the fall, that when my season starts, I do have meetings to go to. We just try to make a living and hopefully they hear our voices, hear our cries and just listen to us.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

That is how I found out. My agent did not tell me.\u201d\n\nTriple jump competitions have not featured at over half the Diamond League meeting this year, indicating they are among the events most at risk of being scrapped or held on city-centre road sides instead, as has been mooted.\n\n\u201cI need to be in the stadiums for sure. These elevated runways are very difficult to jump on. It\u2019s not my preference. At the end of the day, this is my career, this is my life, so if that\u2019s my only option I would do what I have to do. But of course, if I have the opportunity to compete in front of 50,000 people, why would I not want that?\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the IAAF told The Independent: \u201cThose events that will be included in the 2020 Diamond League broadcast will be selected at the end of the outdoor competition season, after the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha. However each Diamond League meeting will still have the opportunity to include other events in its programme, outside of the 90-minute international broadcast window.\u201d\n\nEvents added to individual programmes but not classified as Diamond League events are ineligible for IAAF prize money.\n\nChief executive Jon Ridgeon, a former Olympic sprint hurdler with TeamGB, has co-chaired a \u2018working group\u2019 redesigning the format. \u201cBearing in mind that this year the Diamond League is 10 years old, it was the perfect time to take what was already a very good product but to make it better,\u201d Ridgeon said earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a renewed focus on innovation with the field events. We are going to be seeing more field events outside the stadium in a city centre environment and also within the stadium as well. We will be innovating so we can really bring some of the field events to life that sometimes are lost a little within the multi-ring circus of an athletics event.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think all the stakeholders agreed that it was time for the next evolution,\u201d Ridgeon added.\n\nJamaica\u2019s Frederic Dacres is the reigning Diamond League champion in the men\u2019s discus but also told The Independent he had not received any communication from the IAAF throughout the review process.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say we\u2019ve heard anything,\u201d the Commonwealth Games champion said. \u201cI\u2019m in the dark as much as you guys for now. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and hopefully we\u2019re not going to get bumped.\u201d\n\nDacres believes it could still be possible to compete professionally through entering \u201cdevelopment meets\u201d in Jamaica, Germany, Sweden and the US, but that the Diamond League was \u201cthe big field\u201d for prize money.\n\nTeamGB\u2019s bronze-medal winning former javelin thrower Goldie Sayers believes her successors would \u201cprobably not\u201d be able to compete as full-time professionals if they were to lose access to the Diamond League, in what will be an Olympic year.\n\n\u201cYou need opportunities to compete and make a living, if that is your living,\u201d Sayers said. \u201cJavelin is one of the most iconic events in the Olympic Games and one of the oldest and so for me it would have to stay involved. It is one of the most beautiful events and I\u2019d be very sad if it wasn\u2019t in there and I know the competitors would be fairly devastated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need more competitions for athletes and kids have got to have something to aspire to achieve because you have to \u2018see it\u2019 to want to \u2018be it\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe IAAF say they have listened to \u201cwhat the market told them\u201d and that events need to be streamlined to work for television, which is set to receive a reduced 90 minutes of coverage.\n\nThe changes may mean less exposure for para-athletes, who have featured in events such as London\u2019s Anniversary Games in recent years. \u201cBeing part of the Diamond League is a really important opportunity for para-athletes,\u201d said wheelchair racer Kare Adenegan, who won two medals for ParalympicsGB at the Rio Olympics. \u201cThere are great crowds, great tracks and just to get that publicity, it\u2019s an event that I really enjoy doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be a shame if they took para-events out of the Diamond League because it helps people understand that sport is inclusive: there are so many sports and there really is something out there for everyone.\u201d", "description": "Hundreds of athletes dreaming of glory at next month\u2019s World Athletics Championships may learn they will lose opportunities to continue competing as full-time professionals, and in stadia or on television, immediately after the showpiece in Qatar.\u00a0 The IAAF governing body is restructuring its Diamond League circuit, which has run throughout the European summer every year for", "authors": ["Barney Cullum"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/08/15/12/gettyimages-829383692.jpg"}
