That\u2019s up from a 47%-45% split from last month.\n\nNearly nine-in-10 Democrats said they favor impeachment, as do 50% of independents. But just 6% of Republicans said they support impeaching and removing the president, lower than the 14% who said so last month.\n\nStill, more people (43% to 39%) now say Mr. Trump did not use the presidency improperly in his interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to gain an advantage against a potential 2020 political opponent.\n\nThat shift included a 16-point increase among Republicans, from 71% to 87%, who said Mr. Trump didn\u2019t improperly use his office.\n\nCongress is investigating whether Mr. Trump abused his authority when he suggested in July that Mr. Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nMore people now think both parties are either supporting or opposing impeachment because they want to attack or defend the president at all costs, according to the poll.\n\nForty-two percent said they think most Democrats in Congress support impeaching Mr. Trump because they are out to get the president at all costs, compared to 48% who said it\u2019s because Democrats think the president committed impeachable offenses.\n\nThat\u2019s a change from the 38%-49% split from last month.\n\nAnd 50% believe most Republicans in Congress oppose impeachment because they\u2019re out to protect the president at all costs, compared to 40% who said it\u2019s because Republicans don\u2019t think he committed impeachable offenses.\n\nThat\u2019s a change from a 42%-43% split from last month.\n\nA plurality, 49% to 43%, said they disapprove of how Democrats in Congress are handling impeachment.\n\nA majority, 57% to 30%, said they disapprove of how Republicans in Congress are handling impeachment.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s overall approval rating was 41% in the poll, compared to 57% who said they disapprove. That\u2019s about in line with a 39%-55% split from last month.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who announced last month that the House was formalizing its impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, saw an increase in her favorability rating.\n\nForty-four percent said they have a favorable view of Mrs. Pelosi \u2014 her highest mark since April 2007 \u2014 compared to 46% who reported an unfavorable view.\n\nThat shift is largely due to an increase among independents. In May, 32% of independents had a favorable view of Mrs. Pelosi, compared to 42% now.\n\nThe national survey of 1,003 adults was taken from Oct. 17-20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
