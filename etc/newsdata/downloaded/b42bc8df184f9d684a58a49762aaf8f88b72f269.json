Less than two months have passed since the start of the season but coaches are already swapping posts and being dumped by the wayside.\n\nHowever, amid the constant change in management, Bundesliga side Freiburg are possibly the exception and reaping the rewards of their stability.\n\nChristian Streich has been at the club in various positions since 1995 but, after eight as the club's manager, they are performing as well as they ever have.\n\nChristian Streich celebrates during Freiburg's draw with Borussia Dortmund last time out\n\nFreiburg players celebrate after taking another point during their excellent start to the season\n\nFREIBURG'S LEAGUE RESULTS 19/20 August 17 vs Mainz - W 3-0 (H) August 24 vs Paderborn - W 3-1 (A) August 31 vs Cologne - L 2-1 (H) September 15 vs Hoffenheim - W 3-0 (A) September 21 vs Augsburg - D 1-1 (H) September 29 vs Fortuna Dusseldorf - W 2-1 (A) October 5 vs Dortmund - D 2-2 (H)\n\nStreich enjoyed a 23-game spell at Freiburg as a player in 1987-88 but returned seven years later to take up a position as a youth coach following his retirement.\n\nAfter overseeing the club's under-19s for 16 years, Streich was promoted to help with the first team before officially becoming assistant manager under Marcus Sorg in 2011.\n\nHowever, a poor first half of the season left Freiburg in the relegation zone and their form was enough for Sorg to be axed. Streich took his place and has led the club ever since.\n\nFreiburg have traditionally bounced between the top two tiers of German football but are now establishing themselves at the Bundesliga's summit after winning promotion in 2016.\n\nStreich returned to Freiburg as a youth coach in 1995 following his retirement from the game\n\nAfter taking over the first team in 2011, the club were relegated to the second tier in 2015\n\nStability is at the heart of the club's values and they have never been one to cut ties with a manager lightly. Volker Finke's 16-year reign was an example of that and Streich is the latest to be given time to mould the club to his vision.\n\nA nine-match unbeaten run in the months following his appointment in 2011-12 helped Freiburg secure their top-flight status before Streich then took them to fifth in 2012-13, earning a Europa League spot.\n\nIf there was ever a time for Streich's position to be questioned it was the following campaign. They were dumped out of the Europa League in the group stage and were sat 16th in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe club's board backed their manager though and he turned their form around to finish 14th and avoid the drop. Things got worse the following season though when just five wins in the second half of the campaign condemned Freiburg to relegation.\n\nWith just one year remaining on his contract, the 2015-16 campaign was decisive for Streich's future at Freiburg. He managed to deliver promotion, winning the title above RB Leipzig to return the club to the Bundesliga at the first attempt and sign a new contract to keep him in charge.\n\nSince returning to the top flight, Freiburg have finished seventh and 15th but this season could prove to be the most successful yet. Tipped to be content with just avoiding the drop, Freiburg have started superbly and sit level on points with Bayern Munich and above Borussia Dortmund after seven games.\n\nThey are now established in the Bundesliga and Luca Waldschmidt is a key part of the team\n\nStreich has been in charge for eight years, a lengthy period for a football manager these days\n\nThey have racked up some impressive wins too, seeing off Mainz, Paderborn and Hoffenheim to set the tempo before they followed up with a win at Fortuna Dusseldorf and a hard-earned home draw with Dortmund.\n\nAmong Streich's squad is a fine balance between youth and experience. Luca Waldschmidt was a star at the European Under-21s Championships this summer and has maintained that form, scoring four goals in seven games.\n\nNils Petersen's presence at front has also been a key ingredient for Freiburg's success while Nicolas Hofler has been ever-present in front of a defence that has three players and a goalkeeper to have played all but two minutes this season.\n\nTricky tests are on the horizon with games against RB Leipzig, Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen all to come before December but Freiburg's results prove stability can lead to success.\n\nFreiburg also have a new stadium on the horizon as they prepare to say goodbye to Schwarzwaldstadion, their home ground since 1954, and retaining Bundesliga football will be the minimum expectation. After the start to the season they have had, Streich and Freiburg could be forgiven for targeting Europe again.\n\n", "description": "MAX WINTERS: Christian Streich has been at Freiburg in various coaching positions since 1995 but, after eight as the club's manager, they are performing as well as they ever have.", "authors": ["Max Winters For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/19/19506480-0-image-a-15_1570647257338.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
