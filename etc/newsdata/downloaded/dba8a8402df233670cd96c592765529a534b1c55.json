They really talk about our place, and the years we made them.\"\n\nChester credits her predecessor, French winemaker Gilles Lapalus, with great foresight in planting the two Italian grapes at Sutton Grange in the mid-2000s.\n\n\u201cEven in really hot weather like we had in 2018, fiano and aglianico cope well in the vineyard,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen shiraz vines are curling up, the fiano vines are still reaching for the sky. And it\u2019s the same with the aglianico: the grapes have lots of tannin and high acidity; they love the heat and the dry.\u201d\n\nThis is the first time this double set of Estate varietal wines has been released. Before Chester arrived at the vineyard, the initial trial planting of aglianico only ever yielded enough grapes to make small private bottlings.\n\nNow that subsequent plantings have started to bear fruit, she can bottle a commercial \u2013 albeit very limited \u2013 quantity of the wine, and finally present a full representation of her work at Sutton Grange.\n\n\u201cThese four Estate wines are little time capsules,\u201d she says. \u201cThey really talk about our place, and the years we made them.\u201d\n\nThe Sutton Grange vineyard is just one part of a 400-hectare farm established by Melbourne businessman and racing identity Peter Sidwell. The property also features an equestrian centre and Hereford cattle that devour the leftover grape stems and seeds and skins from the winery.\n\nChester says she enjoys the interconnected aspects of her job on the farm, from winemaking to helping to run a larger business. This involves working with marketing and events manager Jacqui Sidwell, the boss\u2019s daughter who is the same age as Chester.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love being young and able to manage a business like this. Every week is different and challenging. And you see the results because you have to be held accountable for all of it. I sort of throw myself into things and hope there\u2019s something I can learn.\n\n\u201cI like making money for the business, too. I like businesses to be successful, and being able to employ more people.\n\n\"That\u2019s something I didn\u2019t know I was going to enjoy as much as I do.\u201d\n\nReviews\n\n2018 Sutton Grange Estate Viognier\n\nBendigo $50\n\nWhole-bunch pressed and carefully handled, this is an exquisite, delicate viognier, with a cool perfume of lilies and powdered ginger, and a fine, creamy texture that builds subtly on the tongue. Just gorgeous.\n\n2017 Sutton Grange Estate Syrah\n\nBendigo $50\n\nSourced from the best blocks of shiraz on the property and fermented with a third whole bunches, this is a beautiful, elegant expression of the cooler vintage: pepper-fragrant, pure glossy purple fruit, silky tannins.\n\n2018 Sutton Grange Estate Fiano\n\nBendigo $50\n\nA number of factors, from low-yielding vines and small berries to wild fermentation in concrete egg and skin contact in barrel, all contribute to the mouth-filling complexity of this superbly rich fiano.\n\n2017 Sutton Grange Estate Aglianico\n\nBendigo $60\n\nHaving been impressed by trial batches of this wine over the years, I\u2019m happy to see it get a proper release: intense juicy black cherry and dried herb aromatics, and super-fine, lingering, umami-laced tannins.\n\nThe November issue of AFR Magazine, including the Young Rich List, is out on Friday, October 25 inside The Australian Financial Review.
