It is, of course, for the European Council to decide when to consider this request and whether to grant it.\n\n\"Although I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October.\n\n\"While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister... that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us.\n\n\"We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent.\"\n\nAt the first Saturday sitting in the Commons for 37 years, MPs voted in favour of an amendment withholding approval of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal until legislation to implement it is in place.\n\nTabled by Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, the amendment was intended to ensure that Mr Johnson would comply with the terms of the so-called Benn Act.\n\nUnder that Act, which required the PM to seek a Brexit extension, Mr Johnson had until 23:00 BST on Saturday to send a letter requesting an extension.\n\nIn a letter to MPs and peers on Saturday evening, he warned that the EU could reject \"Parliament's request for further delay\" and added that he \"will not negotiate a delay\".\n\n\"I will tell the EU what I have told the British public for my 88 days as prime minister: further delay is not a solution,\" he said.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Boris Johnson: \"I will not negotiate a delay with the EU\"\n\nThe Commons defeat marked a major setback for the PM, who has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave at the end of the month come what may.\n\nMr Johnson told the Commons that he was not \"daunted or dismayed\" by the defeat and remained committed to taking Britain out by the end of the month on the basis of his \"excellent deal\".\n\nAn EU source said that once Mr Tusk received the letter, he would start consulting EU leaders on how to react - which may take a few days, BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming reported.\n\nMr Johnson has vowed to bring in legislation on Monday to implement the deal he struck with Brussels this week.\n\nMPs could also be given another vote on the deal then, if Commons Speaker John Bercow allows it.\n\nAnalysis: Reluctant EU considers UK request\n\nImage copyright Reuters\n\nBoris Johnson literally spelling out his opposition to prolonging the Brexit process by writing a separate letter to Brussels to say so, makes it easier for his peers Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and others to drag their feet a little.\n\nThey prefer first to look to the prime minister to make good on his promise to them that their newly-negotiated Brexit deal will *definitely* be passed by Parliament.\n\nBut, if push comes to shove, with the alternative being no deal at all... I cannot imagine the EU slamming the door in the face of the UK now.\n\nThey will want to know what [the extension] is for. Are there plans in the UK to hold a general election, a second referendum or a referendum on the new Brexit deal? Or is a bit more time needed to pass Brexit-related legislation?\n\nRead Katya's full analysis\n\nDo you have any questions about the latest Brexit developments?\n\nIn some cases your question will be published, displaying your name and location as you provide it, unless you state otherwise.
