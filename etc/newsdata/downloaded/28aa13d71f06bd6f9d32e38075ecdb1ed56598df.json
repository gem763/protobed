Luggage you can roll or carry onto a plane\u2026 and down urban streets, through mountainsides and everything in between. These roomy rollable duffels will survive the lumpy, coarse carpets in the airport, the gravelly and cobblestoned corners of city and the dusty trails. And even though they\u2019ll survive the luggage belt drop at baggage claim, too, you won\u2019t need to check them.\n\nEagle Creek Gear Warrior Wheeled Duffel, $249 at Backcountry: Eagle Creek\u2019s Gear Warrior Duffel\u2019s durable design boasts oversized tires, reinforced corners, an impact-resistant handle system and an exo-skeleton shell to take you through congested airports, over city curbs and cobblestones, and across rugged terrains alike. So you won\u2019t have to dig while adventuring, there\u2019s a padded tablet sleeve in the secondary front compartment and an equipment keeper to store your essential gear and outerwear at the top. And the lockable zippers will keep it all safe.\n\nPatagonia Black Hole Wheeled Duffel Bag 40L, $299 at Patagonia: This recycled polyester ripstop duffel from Patagonia is as tough as the terrains you\u2019ll find yourself trekking with it. The weather-resistant TPU-film laminate and water-repellent finish will keep all of your clothes and gear protected from the elements. And the zippered external side pocket and mesh pockets in the lid add additional space for smaller items you may need accessible\u2014like your passport, phone and portable charger.\n\nL.L. Bean Medium Rolling Adventure Duffle, $119 at L.L.Bean: The polyester, polyurethane-coated Rolling Adventure duffel is L.L. Bean\u2019s most popular bag of its kind. That\u2019s largely thanks to its strong construction complete with a telescoping handle and smooth-glide wheels. And, unlike many duffels on the rollable market, this one\u2019s rigid platform keeps it from sagging and dragging, so you can traverse the globe unscathed. If you\u2019re tired of rolling it, you can carry it by hand or on your shoulders by the padded straps, too.\n\nTimbuk2 Wander Backpack Duffel, $179 at Timbuk2: Timbuk2\u2019s convertible Wander is touted as a \u201ctravel machine.\u201d And we don\u2019t disagree. The cushy backpack straps and ventilated back panel make it just as effortless to carry on your back as it is to pull on wheels. The inside is organized for your laptop, gear and toiletries, and there\u2019s even a coveted wet pocket/shoe compartment. Plus, there\u2019s easy access to all of those items because of the all-around zip.\n\nOsprey Transporter Wheeled Duffel 40L, $240 at Zappos: Osprey\u2019s burly Transporter duffel features an extendable handle and oversized wheels to keep you rolling\u2014to your gate or the trailhead. Six lash points ensure secure transport on a roof rack during a road trip or on a pack animal during a trek. Meanwhile, overlapping rainflap zippers and the abrasion- and water-resistant, TPU-coated nylon material will keep your contents safe in case of fickle weather. And the organized compartments with compression straps will stabilize your load.\n\nEddie Bauer Medium Expedition Drop Bottom Rolling Duffel, $139 at Eddie Bauer: Built to withstand an adventure for the books, Eddie Bauer\u2019s Expedition Drop Bottom rolling duffel\u2019s ripstop nylon is reinforced with ballistic nylon. Inside, the main compartment of the bag is separated into two zippered sections, both of which you can compress with straps. And, if you don\u2019t use all of the straps, you can simply take them off for less bothersome dangle.\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
