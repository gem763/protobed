By the end of the ordeal, six homes burned down within a block of my house. While I escaped the serious damage, I later learned that I wasn't completely out of the woods when it came to fire damage.\n\nA few months after the fire, I climbed a ladder into my attic to check on an issue with the air conditioning in one room. While investigating, I discovered a layer of ash covering everything in my attic.\n\nWith the new discovery, I figured it was time to file a claim with my insurance company. The results were not at all what I expected. Here's why you should never delay when filing a claim with your homeowner's insurance.\n\nTimely filing requirements\n\nIf you experience a covered loss, insurance companies require you to file a claim in a timely manner. This makes sense for many reasons. If you delay, there's a chance the damage could get worse. It can also make it harder to assess liability when deciding who is at fault and has to pay.\n\nShortly after the fire, a friend advised me to file a claim right away for smoke damage. But as an ethical person, I didn't know of any smoke damage in my house and didn't file a claim. I should have listened to my friend.\n\nDoing the right thing ultimately cost me about $7,500. I didn't know about any smoke or ash issues outside of a little ash in the windowsills, so I didn't file a claim. I figured we could clean that ourselves.\n\nBut the ash in the attic had me worried about a need to replace our insulation or do a more thorough cleaning. Immediately upon discovery of the issue, I filed a claim.\n\nThinking about a new homeowner's insurance policy?

I don't know about you, but I don't go into my unfinished attic more than once a year unless there's an issue up there. But because it was more than 90 days after the fire, the limit my policy gave me, my claim was severely restricted.\n\nThe delayed discovery rule didn't come to my aid\n\nMy insurance policy says that I have 90 days to file a claim after a loss. But because I didn't discover the loss soon enough, I got a letter from my insurer saying I would get only about 25% of the benefit I should. I was pretty mad, and I wasn't going to take it sitting down.\n\nFirst, I did some research and found a California law that protects insured individuals called the \"delayed discovery rule.\" Because I didn't know about the damage, the 90-day clock should start when it's discovered, according to the rule.\n\nThe insurance company said it didn't apply. I sent a complaint to the California Insurance Commission, which got me a letter from both the state and the insurer, but no resolution. I spoke to a lawyer about it, and he advised sending a letter appealing the decision based on my having had a baby during the fire, but that didn't go anywhere either.\n\nApparently the law doesn't cover my situation, which I still don't understand. But I wasn't going to spend $5,000 on a lawyer to chase $7,500. So I let it go and accepted the 25% payout. But I'm still not happy and want to make sure the same thing doesn't happen to you.\n\nInsurance companies work hard to not pay a claim\n\nInsurance companies make money in several ways. If you ask Warren Buffett, CEO of a company that controls multiple successful insurance businesses, the most important way an insurer makes money is \"float,\" which is investing cash between when you pay a premium and when a claim may be paid out.\n\nBut if they can avoid paying a claim altogether, that's just profit in their pocket. That is why insurance companies employ legions of lawyers, adjusters, and other professionals who work hard every day to make sure they keep as much money as they can.\n\nAs an insured individual, you have to stand up for yourself to make sure you get the appropriate payout when you deserve one.\n\nBe aggressive in dealing with insurance\n\nIf you have any doubt that you'll need to file a claim, take the time and do it as early as possible. A delay cost me about $7,500. Don't let the same thing happen to you.\n\nWhether it's a home, auto, health, or other type of insurance claim, it only takes a few minutes to call or start a claim online. If I had done that, I wouldn't have lost out. It's an expensive lesson to learn. But if you move quickly, it's a lesson you can completely avoid.", "description": "I didn't discover a layer of ash in my home until after my homeowner's insurance policy's 90-day window had closed, and I lost out on a lot of money.", "authors": ["Eric Rosenberg"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d85107d2e22af3e211ab378-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
