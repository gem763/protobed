Willis was married to Moore from 1987 to 2000 and they have three daughters together. She later married Kutcher in 2005 and they divorced in 2013.\n\n\"I have a sensitivity to anything that might make them uncomfortable,\" she says of writing about her exes in such a forthright manner. Moore and Willis remain amicable, and she even went to his vow renewal ceremony with his wife, Emma Heming Willis.\n\nAs for if she still keeps in touch with Kutcher, who married his That '70s Show co-star, Mila Kunis, four years ago, Moore admits, \"We have some things that overlap. ...It\u2019s friendly. But we\u2019re not...hanging out.\"\n\nBruce Willis and Demi Moore attend the after-party for the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis at NeueHouse on July 14, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

So I\u2019m like, I\u2019m going to give it a try!\"\n\nThe G.I. Jane star has never looked better during her book tour, but admits that her current exercise routine is \"nothing, right now.\"\n\nIn addition to her piece in WSJ, the third part of her interview with Diane Sawyer aired on Wednesday's Good Morning America, and Moore recalls the scary night when she had a seizure at a birthday party that had \"party favors,\" including \"synthetic pot, nitros oxide.\"\n\n\"Everyone else was witnessing my body flailing. My daughter, terrified that she was going to see me die right in front of her, and within me I was in a place that was thinking, 'Wow, how did I get in here? Isn\u2019t this interesting?'\" Moore remembers. \"And then my very next thought was, 'I wonder if I can get out.' And all of a sudden I was back in my body. I think it was a moment that I was somehow being given a choice.\"\n\n\"Do you think it was close?\" Sawyer asks. \"I think certainly emotionally it was,\" Moore replies. \"I think something had to give. When you come up to those places you either go in or you go out.\"\n\nDespite all she's gone through, Moore has an attitude of gratitude. \"I don\u2019t feel a victim to my life,\" she tells Sawyer, before revealing her mantra, \"Survival, success, surrender and celebration.\"\n\nMoore's book, Inside Out, is out now.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nEverything Demi Moore Says About Her Relationship With Ashton Kutcher\n\nAshton Kutcher Says He Deleted a 'Really Snarky Tweet' Amid Demi Moore Memoir Release\n\nDemi Moore's 'Inside Out': The Most Shocking Revelations From Her New Memoir\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "\"Right now I\u2019m focusing on my relationship with myself.\"", "authors": ["Jackie Willis"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ltHte9HnOjcNQWnshZG5_A--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/021a3078fd218e5ae269630a5f637f07", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
