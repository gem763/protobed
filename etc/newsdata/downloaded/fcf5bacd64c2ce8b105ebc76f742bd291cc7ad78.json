Nixon ended up resigning after before he was formally impeached.\n\n\"Wow,\" Howell said after the hearing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., that the Justice Department now disagreed with Sirica's ruling.\n\n\"As I said, the department is taking extraordinary positions in this case,\" Howell said.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee is seeking the Mueller grand jury information as part of its ongoing impeachment inquiry into Trump. That information would include transcripts of testimony by witnesses to the grand jury.\n\nDouglas Letter, a lawyer for the committee, told Howell that the House of Representatives is entitled to \"absolute deference\" in impeachment inquiries, according to NBC News.\n\nBut Elizabeth Shapiro, an attorney in the DOJ's civil division, argued to Howell that in order to properly seek the grand jury material the House should first vote on a resolution authorizing a formal impeachment inquiry, and then seek the material through a judicial proceeding.\n\nLetter disputed that idea.\n\n\"We are in an impeachment inquiry, an impeachment investigation, a formal impeachment investigation, because the House says it is,\" Letter said.\n\nHowell ended the hearing without making a decision on the House's request.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry kicked off two weeks ago after it was revealed that Trump, who had been withholding congressionally appropriated military aid from Ukraine, pressured that country's newly elected president in July to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.", "description": "Justice Department lawyers argued that the decision to release normally secret grand jury materials to the House when Richard Nixon faced impeachment, was incorrect.", "authors": ["Dan Mangan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106170458-1570551952583preview.jpg?v=1570551971", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
