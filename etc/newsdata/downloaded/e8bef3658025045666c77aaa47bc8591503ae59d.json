REUTERS/Michael Dalder\n\nThe company, promoted to the DAX blue-chip index last year, has been the target of a series of investigative reports by FT reporter Dan McCrum, with the latest, on Oct. 15, knocking more than 20% off its share price.\n\nIt has rejected the newspaper\u2019s latest allegations, based on internal spreadsheets and correspondence, that Wirecard\u2019s senior finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits at its businesses in Dubai and Ireland.\n\nThe FT\u2019s reporting has however led to calls on Wirecard from investors and corporate governance advocates to hire an outside auditor both to clear up the matter and to demonstrate that it meets the governance standards of a top-tier public company.\n\n\u201cWe have complete confidence in the audit procedures performed to date and their results. We assume this renewed independent review will lead to a final end to all further speculation,\u201d Wulf Matthias, chairman of Wirecard AG\u2019s supervisory board, said in a statement.\n\nWirecard shares rose by 3.5% in pre-market trading in Frankfurt.\n\nThe audit will begin immediately, Wirecard said, adding that KPMG would report to the company\u2019s supervisory board and have unrestricted access to information at all levels of the group.\n\nThomas Eichelmann, chairman of the audit committee of Wirecard\u2019s supervisory board and a former chief financial officer of Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1Gn.DE), will support the audit on behalf of Wirecard.\n\nWirecard has long been a favorite target of short sellers, or speculators who seek to profit from the airing of negative information that drives down a company\u2019s share price.\n\nIt has accused the FT and reporter McCrum of colluding with short sellers, as well as suing the newspaper. Financial Times Editor Lionel Barber has said an investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence to support those claims.\n\nIn-house auditor EY signed off on Wirecard\u2019s 2018 accounts in April after an earlier FT story alleged fraud and false accounting at the company\u2019s Singapore office.\n\nAn investigation by an outside law firm found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by head office, although Singapore staff may have broken local laws, Wirecard said at the time.\n\nSeparately, German prosecutors are investigating a group of individuals on suspicion of manipulating Wirecard stock, acting on evidence provided by financial market regulator Bafin.", "description": "German payments company Wirecard has hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit to address allegations by the Financial Times that its finance team had sought to inflate reported sales and profits, it said on Monday.", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443256836&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0DO", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
