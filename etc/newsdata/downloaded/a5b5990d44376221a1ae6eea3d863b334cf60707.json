Here\u2019s Why He May Be Right", "language": "en", "text": "The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com.\n\nEven with the American people pretty much divided along party lines on whether or not President Donald Trump deserves to be impeached and removed from office for the non-crime of asking the president of Ukraine to investigate a possible crime, Trump supporters haven\u2019t seemed to be really all that worried about the prospect. That\u2019s probably because of the widespread belief that, regardless of what the Democratic-controlled House does, the Senate, firmly in the hands of the venerable Cocaine Mitch\u2019s GOP, would easily vote to acquit the president.\n\nAnd those who want to see Trump removed wouldn\u2019t just need a simple majority, something that could be obtained even without the votes of RINO squishes like Romney, Collins, and Murkowski, but a SUPER majority, or 67 senators. In other words, 20, yes 20 Republican senators would have to defect and vote to remove Trump in order to make it happen.\n\nSo we\u2019re safe, right? ... Right??\n\nUh, not so fast! At least that\u2019s what embattled Trump confidante Roger Stone says, warning Trump via a Friday media interview to take the ongoing impeachment inquiry \"very seriously\" and not to assume an automatic Senate acquittal.\n\nThe former Trump associate speculated that \"wobbly Republican senators\" could vote against the president unless pressure from their constituents is brought to bear.\n\n\"I think that those who sit back and say, 'Well, the House may impeach the president, but surely the Republican Senate will never convict him,' I think are being naive,\" said Stone, adding that Trump is \"in for an incredible fight\" because the media and the \"two-party duopoly\" is against him and hope the attacks against him \"will wear his support down in the states where there are wobbly Republican senators, so they feel comfortable voting for his removal.\"\n\nStone said the notion that anything in Washington these days is simply \u201cRepublicans vs Democrats\u201d is \u201coutdated thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is insiders versus an outsider,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the status quo versus a disruptor.\"\n\nSo, is Stone onto something here? I sure would love to say no way, that is if my Daily Caller colleagues hadn\u2019t contacted EVERY SINGLE Republican Senate office just last week to ask them if they would rule out impeaching and removing Trump from office. Out of 53 senators, how many do you think responded in the affirmative?\n\nTwenty? Thirty?\n\nHow about ... seven.\n\nGive a round of applause to Senators Jim Inhofe, Thom Tillis, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Roger Wicker, Mike Rounds, Rob Portman, Jerry Moran for seeing through this ridiculous charade right away. But what\u2019s up with the other 46? Even accounting for some who didn\u2019t respond because they didn\u2019t get the message in time or others who know how they\u2019ll vote but want to hold out official comment because of their potential role as \u201cjuror,\u201d that\u2019s a pretty high number. Sure, nobody thinks Ted Cruz would really vote to remove Trump from office, but they only need 20, remember? Suddenly, it doesn\u2019t seem like such an impossible reach.\n\nThen, you might remember, there\u2019s GOP consultant Mike Murphy, who claimed last month that upwards of 30 Republican senators would vote to remove Trump from office if only their vote were held in secret. Sure, he\u2019s a former Romney, McCain, and Jeb! advisor, so take what he says with more than a little grain of salt, but it\u2019s still a disturbing thought.\n\nWhat\u2019s the answer? Well, Stone\u2019s suggestion for the president, and it\u2019s a great one, is to use his \"incredible fundraising juggernaut\" to advertise in states where \"there are Republican senators who may be thinking about joining this lynch mob.\"\n\n\"As long as the president remains more popular in those states than those individual senators, they will be loath to cast a vote against the president, particularly based on the thinnest read that we have seen so far,\" he said. Stone's advice to Trump, and I completely concur: \"Take this very seriously. Continue to demand total transparency. Stay very focused on those states with wobbly Republican senators. That is where this fight will be won or lost.\"\n\nIn sum, some of these \u201cwobbly\u201d GOP senators may dislike, even hate President Trump in secret, but odds are they like their power and position even more. They need to unequivocally know that stabbing Trump voters in the back will mean the end of their political career, period. Good luck getting elected dog catcher, much less to another Senate term. They can pack up and take their misguided \u201cprinciples\u201d to the house.\n\n\"Donald Trump is the toughest guy I've ever met, and he isn't doing it for himself. He's doing it for us,\" said Stone.\n\nMaybe so, but going forward he\u2019s going to need a LOT of help.\n\nPerhaps the Senate vote will indeed turn out to be a breeze, especially if no evidence of actual lawbreaking turns up, but given today\u2019s crazy political times, it would be a mistake to take ANYTHING for granted.", "description": "Even with the American people pretty much divided along party .10/28/2019 0:24:15AM EST.", "authors": ["Scott Morefield", "Beth Baumann", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/25/aa40452e-2b03-4e87-b746-23dddb0449ab.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
