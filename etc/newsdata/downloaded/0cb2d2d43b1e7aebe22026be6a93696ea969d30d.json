She's showed off her toned abs a few times over the past few months, and now, she's giving fans a firsthand glimpse into exactly how she stays fit AF. The Modern Family actress, 21, just posted a workout video getting in a good sweat sesh with her trainer. In the video, Ariel shows off her sculpted core and butt in a black sports bra and blue sweatpants\u2014all while doing some weighted squats and deadlifts. Plus, she's balancing on two weight benches, which is already impressive, tbh.\n\n\"I know I missed #motivationmonday so here is #tuesdaymotivation with @mackfit :) I am never the most excitedddd person to go to the gym, but feeling healthier and seeing the work you put in pay off really makes it worth it \u2764\ufe0f Also... @mackfittraininggym is a BOSS and keeps reminding me of my \ud83c\udf51 goals \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc,\" she captioned her video.\n\nThough Ariel might not be a huge fan of the gym, she's been vocal on social media about the importance of being healthy\u2014regardless of what others might think of her body. In January 2019, she's clapped back at body shamers who criticized her for losing weight. (Although it definitely wasn't the first time she stood up for herself to people hating on her body.) And in April, she opened up about her recent weight loss and factored it in due to changes with an antidepressant she'd been taking.\n\nAfter strength training, Ariel had some fun dancing in the gym. \"Peep the second video to see my \"floss' skills \ud83d\ude0f #goals #fitness #fitnessmotivation #workout #healthy #motivation #exercise,\" she wrote.\n\nThen, in Ariel's Instagram stories, she followed up her training sesh with a selfie and gave fans some insight into her post-gym activities...which included making a delicious-looking homemade lasagna.
