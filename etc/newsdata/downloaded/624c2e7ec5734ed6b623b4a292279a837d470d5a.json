(with) an average age of 27,\" he added in a speech.\n\nUniqlo is among more than 300 international fashion brands expected to open stores in India in the next two years, according to a November report by consultancy McKinsey and the Business of Fashion trade publication.\n\nMcKinsey said that the vast nation's apparel market was forecast to be worth $59.3 billion in 2022, making it the sixth-largest in the world.\n\nHowever, India is notorious for its price-sensitive consumers, while ethnic wear still infuses much of local fashion, particularly among women.\n\nUniqlo is attempting to address the second point by including for the Indian market a \"Kurta collection\" created in collaboration with an Indian designer.\n\nBut on price, Uniqlo so far appears to be selling its clothing at similar levels as in the United States and Australia, and more expensive than in Malaysia.\n\nOne signature item, a women's ultra light down vest for women, retails at 3,490 rupees ($49.10) compared to $49.90 in the U.S. and 149.90 ringgit ($35.80) in Malaysia.\n\n\"India is a highly competitive market, and a lot of global brands are already here, along with many successful home-grown brands,\" Edelweiss Securities analyst Abneesh Roy told The Print news website.\n\n\"Uniqlo is definitely entering late, and it will not be easy.\"\n\nOn Friday around 500 shoppers of a mix of ages queued up to enter the new store when it opened, with Yanai there to welcome them.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japanese clothing giant Uniqlo on Friday opened its first store in India, one of its largest worldwide, becoming the latest global retailer to plunge into the huge but tough developing market.
