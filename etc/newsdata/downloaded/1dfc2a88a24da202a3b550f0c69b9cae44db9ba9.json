But for decades, schools and institutions have been pushing degrees as the pathway to success.\n\nJust last week, figures showed that more than 50 per cent of young people in England are going to university 20 years after Tony Blair\u2019s Labour Party set the target as policy.\n\nSo it will take a lot of work to suddenly persuade younger generations that higher education is not necessary for everyone and there are other, less established, routes available.\n\nIt may also be difficult to get politicians onside as they are likely to have reaped the benefits of university themselves. And they may be wary of pushing these alternatives to their own children. Meanwhile, parents have been accused of being \u201csnobbish\u201d towards technical education.\n\nIt took Labour two decades to achieve their aim of most young people attending university \u2013 so with the funding issues facing the FE sector, and engrained beliefs that academic routes are better, it seems unlikely that the UK will be leaders in technical education by 2029.", "description": "The education secretary has set out his ambitious goal to beat Germany in technical education provision in just 10 years.\u00a0Gavin Williamson insists his aim is \u201ccredible\u201d but it is likely to that significant reform will be needed to match Germany \u2013 where many youngsters jump at the chance to enter vocational routes.", "authors": ["Eleanor Busby"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/02/14/apprenticeship.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
