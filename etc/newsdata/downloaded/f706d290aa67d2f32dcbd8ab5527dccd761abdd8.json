The airborne priest believes all physical ailments have a spiritual root - \"Every illness is caused by a virus, and viruses are demons. That's why every illness is first and foremost a spiritual illness\".\n\nImage copyright Rossiya 1/YouTube Image caption Bishop Savva reads the prayers on board the plane\n\nA man called Vyacheslav endorsed this view.\n\nHe said he managed to quit the drink after turning to the Inexhaustible Chalice icon for help during a pilgrimage to Tver - on which he also met his future wife Olga. They both joined the clerics on the latest flight over Tver.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nFr Alexander insisted that the holy water had to be poured from a chalice, not the instrument called an aspergillum that priests use in church.\n\n\"This stops the spray from being blown back into the plane,\" he explained.\n\nThe story has naturally caused much amusement in the Russian media, but Fr Alexander has an answer for everything.\n\n\"Laugh if you must, you'll live longer. But what are you laughing at? Our efforts to help people heal themselves and stop drinking, taking drugs and fornicating?\"\n\n\"Let them laugh, but it won't stop us doing our job,\" he said.\n\nImage copyright Tver News/YouTube Image caption Fr Alexander has flown the icon over Tver every year\n\nReporting by Francis Scarr\n\nNext story: Vietnam seeks 'wizards' to do up old apartments\n\nUse #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter.", "description": "Priests in a plane poured holy water on the city of Tver to purge it of drunkenness and fornication.", "authors": ["News Elsewhere...", "...As Found Bbc Monitoring"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13609/production/_108796397_tver3.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
