I got a language learning app on my iPhone and dutifully brushed up on my French, reaching a level where I was competent enough to greet people, handle basic topics like directions and ordering food, and to apologize for my horrid accent.\n\nAfter the trip, I had no need (or free time) to further my language studies, so I stopped using the app. But the app continued to send me notifications multiple times a day, mostly trying to guilt me into returning to the unused application.\n\nThe solution?
