This suggests it is both resilient and flexible in adapting to both harsh and benign environments.\n\nNematodes are a \u2018truly trisexual\u2019 species, meaning they are male, female and hermaphrodite.\n\nThe have both eggs and sperm, and produce several hundred offspring through self-fertilisation. If they choose to breed via sexual reproduction they can shuffle their genes to produce lots of male offspring,\n\nThe problem with self-fertilisation is that the offspring lack the genetic diversity that comes from male-female breeding.\n\nWhen environmental conditions are positive male female sexual reproduction makes sense. However, when things are worse, they self-fertilise and produce lots of offspring very quickly which can then go a and find new places to live.\n\n\u201cExtremophiles can teach us so much about innovative strategies for dealing with stress,\u201d said Dr Pei-Yin Shih, a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cOur study shows we still have much to learn about how these 1000-celled animals have mastered survival in extreme environments.\u201d\n\nDrinking water contaminated with arsenic is a major global health concern. Understanding how these worms deal with it could help researchers understand how it moves through and affects cells.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tremendously important that we appreciate and develop a curiosity for biodiversity,\u201d said Dr James Siho Lee, who is now a postdoctoral fellow at The Rockefeller University.\n\n\u201cThe next innovation for biotechnology could be out there in the wild. A new biodegradable sunscreen, for example, was discovered from extremophilic bacteria and algae. We have to protect and responsibly utilise wildlife.\u201d", "description": "A new species of worm with three sexes has been discovered in a briny Californian lake that was previously thought to be practically devoid of life.\u00a0 The microscopic worm is so resilient in can survive 500 times the lethal human dose of arsenic and also carries its young inside its body like a kangaroo.", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/26/14/worm-caltech.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
