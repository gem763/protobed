in 2009\n\nKeith Vaz faces a six month suspension from Parliament after he was shamed by a watchdog that found he offered to buy cocaine for a male prostitute.\n\nThe Commons Standards Committee said there was \u2018compelling evidence\u2019 the veteran Labour MP, one of the most prominent figures in the party for years, had paid for sex during an encounter with two men in August 2016 and \u2018expressed a willingness\u2019 to purchase the Class A drug.\n\nIn a scathing report, it accused Mr Vaz, the former chairman of the home affairs committee, of trying to \u2018throw dust in the eyes\u2019 of the parliamentary authorities with his implausible explanations.\n\nThe committee said his claims including that he had met the men to discuss painting and decorating and that his drink may have been spiked were \u2018not believable and, indeed, ludicrous\u2019.\n\nIt also questioned Mr Vaz\u2019s suggestion he could not remember what had happened because he had amnesia \u2013 as he did not mention this until four months into an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\n\nThe Sunday Mirror reported he had discussed buying cocaine with a rent boy\n\nThe committee found Mr Vaz had committed a \u2018very serious\u2019 breach of the code of conduct for MPs.\n\nIt said that by failing to co-operate fully with the Commons inquiry process, Mr Vaz had shown \u2018disrespect for the House\u2019s standards system\u2019 and caused \u2018significant damage\u2019 to the reputation and integrity of the Commons.\n\nThe report marks a spectacular fall from grace for Mr Vaz, who is renowned for his love of publicity.\n\nAfter entering Parliament as the MP for Leicester East in 1987, he became a prominent figure in the party and served as a junior minister under Tony Blair.\n\nMr Vaz was previously suspended from the Commons for one month in 2002 after the standards and privileges committee found he had recklessly made a damaging and untrue allegation against a former police officer who had made a complaint about him.\n\nHe was filmed saying he would pay for the class A drug but would not take it himself\n\nMPs will now vote in the coming days on whether to accept the committee\u2019s recommendation that Mr Vaz be suspended for six months and that he face a recall petition that will lead to a by-election if 10 per cent of his constituents sign.\n\nHowever, he will be allowed to stand again if a general election is called in the meantime.\n\nAn investigation was launched into Mr Vaz after a Sunday newspaper reported he had met two men in his London flat to engage in paid-for sex in August 2016.\n\nMr Vaz apologised to his wife of 23 years Maria Fernandes (right), and his children, for the 'hurt and distress' he caused them after he was allegedly filmed meeting two rent boys at his flat\n\nIn the course of the encounter \u2013which was covertly audio-recorded by one of the men \u2013 Mr Vaz was said to have offered to buy illegal drugs for a third person to use.\n\nThe committee said the three-year investigation could have been concluded earlier if the MP had given a \u2018candid and co-operative account\u2019 from the outset.\n\nThe Commissioner for Standards, who produced a report for the committee, challenged Mr Vaz\u2019s claim he had not knowingly met the men before that evening.\n\nShe concluded: \u2018The recording reveals Mr Vaz has prior knowledge of the personal circumstances of the two men, as well as references to the \u201clast time\u201d they met.\u2019\n\nOn Mr Vaz\u2019s claim he had amnesia, the Commissioner said: \u2018I find it very surprising that he did not say from the start that he had no memory of the events in question.\u2019\n\nA statement on Mr Vaz\u2019s website last night said he had been treated for a \u2018serious mental-health condition\u2019 as a result of the events of August 2016. \u2018He has nothing further to say on this matter,\u2019 the statement said.\n\nText messages allegedly showed him asking the escorts to bring sex-enhancing drugs to his North London flat\n\nThe Parliamentary Standards Commissioner launched a probe into whether Mr Vaz was guilty of a conflict of interest because he had been leading a review of vice laws at the time of the allegations", "description": "Keith\u00a0Vaz faces a six month suspension from Parliament after he was shamed
