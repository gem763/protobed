(Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nPerhaps the most humbling moment of the Washington Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss on Monday night came near the end of the second quarter, when cornerback Josh Norman was beat on an out-and-up route to the end zone. Chicago Bears wide receiver Taylor Gabriel came down with an acrobatic 36-yard catch near the pylon, but officials had ruled he stepped out. Norman hovered above his opponent, waving his arms in a taunting manner, as if he was certain Gabriel had not scored.\n\nExcept after officials reviewed the play, they determined that Gabriel had indeed got both feet inbounds for a touchdown. The Bears led 28-0 at that point, demoralizing Norman and a defense that gave up at least 30 points for a third straight loss to open the season.\n\nThe lackluster performance was compounded by the fact that it came against Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, who had struggled with his accuracy through his first two games this season and had not yet thrown a touchdown pass. Trubisky had three in the first half alone \u2014 all to the speedy Gabriel, defended by Norman, at least in part \u2014 and finished 25-for-31 for 231 yards on a night when he rarely faced pressure. Washington created no turnovers, as their offense committed five.\n\nA week after Coach Jay Gruden called defensive coordinator Greg Manusky\u2019s unit \u201cvanilla\u201d in a loss to Dallas, Manusky\u2019s defense again looked bland and incapable of big plays Monday.\n\n\u201cWe just have to keep pushing, man. We just have to keep pushing. This thing is a sprint, not a marathon,\u201d Norman said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first quarter of the season. Right now we\u2019re 0-3. \u2026 All we can do is look forward to is the Giants, go in there and get a win.\u201d\n\n[Svrluga: At 0-3, it\u2019s time to ask: What is this Redskins season even about?]\n\nThat game at New York next week, against a Giants team reinvigorated by rookie quarterback Daniel Jones, will be considered a must-win for these Redskins, who were searching for answers to the same bitter questions on Monday night. Was communication and missed assignments to blame for the defense\u2019s poor first half start? Was it the scheme that couldn\u2019t stop a struggling Trubisky? Is it the fault of Manusky, the third-year coordinator who has received plenty of criticism recently? And what could this unit possibly do this week to turn everything around and save the season?\n\nMost members of the defense didn\u2019t have solid answers.\n\n\u201cYou look at the film, we\u2019re just not getting pass rush. Letting guys get wide open. The defense isn\u2019t communicating. We\u2019re just not doing the little things right,\u201d said defensive lineman Jonathan Allen. \u201cThere\u2019s not a secret recipe to play good defense, to play hard, play physical and communicate. We have to find out where the lack of communication, physicality and effort is, starting with myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stand together. Just have to build something,\u201d Redskins safety Landon Collins said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s gotta do something.\u201d\n\nThere was little pressure by Washington on Trubisky, who had entered Monday night having struggled with his accuracy. He broke his no-touchdown streak on a second-and-goal play from the Washington three-yard line, when Chicago ran its grouping of receivers one direction into the end zone and Gabriel slipped through the traffic underneath to the backside. Linebacker Ryan Anderson froze and watched Gabriel run by him. He was all alone. Trubisky likely had enough room to run it in himself, but opted to flip the ball to Gabriel for a three-yard score.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get a beat on what they do. They have good personnel,\u201d said Redskins outside linebacker Ryan Kerrigan.\n\nOn the next possession, after Norman had interfered with Gabriel in the end zone, Trubisky found Gabriel on a short one-yard pass to make it 21-0. A few minutes later, that was followed by the 36-yard strike from Trubisky to Gabriel, who tapped his feet just inside the pylon to score. Norman questioned the officiating on that play and others afterward.\n\n\u201cLet us play, man,\u201d Norman said, shaking his head afterward.\n\nWashington, which has given up an average of 402 yards in its first three games and ranks 26th in the NFL in total defense, stiffened in the second half. Norman came up with an interception after Trubisky underthrew a pass to Allen Robinson at the goal line in the third quarter to keep the Redskins\u2019 faint hopes alive. It was too late. After it was over, Norman returned to his stall and was among the last to leave a silent locker room. He remained optimistic that his unit would \u201ccatch a break\u201d as it moves on to New York next week, yet there were still so many lingering questions.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we can do is just show up, put on our hard hats and go to work,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThat\u2019s all we have, and that\u2019s all we can do.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nKey moments from the Redskins\u2019 \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 loss\n\nHail or Fail: Redskins can\u2019t spell, stir correctly or win in another Monday night debacle\n\nThree takeaways from Redskins\u2019 31-15 loss to the Bears", "description": "Washington gave up 30 points for a third consecutive week in Monday's loss to Chicago, and ranks among the worst teams in the NFL in total defense.", "authors": ["Roman Stubbs", "Sports Reporter", "September At Am", "Roman Stubbs Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/9A550kyeK_kV-iFRebWWe-QgjlA=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/M6MTFVG6PEI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
