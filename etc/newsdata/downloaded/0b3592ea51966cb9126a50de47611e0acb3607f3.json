And so it\u2019s no surprise to see the financial markets seesaw along with President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter feed.\n\n\u201cHow do you invest in this environment? ... When a tweet can move a market 200 points intraday, if not even more?\u201d Yahoo Finance\u2019s Brian Sozzi wondered on a recent episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s The First Trade. \u201cDo you buy some stock and hold off the next 25 years? What you do?\u201d\n\nBrian Levitt, the U.S. senior director for investment strategy at Invesco, told Sozzi that it depends on an investor\u2019s time horizon.\n\n\"I mean, for somebody like me, my policy statement is I got to send two kids to college and get them out of my home, and I\u2019ve got some years to do that,\u201d Levitt told Sozzi. \u201cI'm going to try and grow the base. You know, I'm not looking for safety or income, right now. So my view is \u2018This is going to be a slow growth world for ... a lot of the rest of the time.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn other words, long-term investors have time to weather this short-term volatility. And so instead of monitoring the president\u2019s Twitter feed, investors should focus on the long-term picture for what drives the market.\n\nDonald Trump using phone in 2016 (AP) More\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lack of clarity on trade\u2019\n\nOn August 23, Trump had demanded U.S. businesses stop doing business with China and threatened immediate tariffs. The market fell 600 points. But his tone changed Tuesday, saying that he was confident that a deal would be reached, and soon, and the markets rebounded.\n\n....better off without them. The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP. Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2019\n\nThat was just the latest in the market whiplash that happens when the president takes to Twitter. Earlier in August, shortly after the Fed cut interest rates, Trump tweeted that the U.S. would be imposing a 10% tariff on an additional $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, starting in September (he has since pushed those back to December to avoid hurting the holiday shopping season). The S&P tumbled after those tweets and closed down almost 1%.\n\nOf course, a number of other factors aside from the president\u2019s Twitter feed may be influencing the markets.\n\n\u201cI mean, I've always been of the belief that, you know, hating the government or focusing on the executive branch of government should not be your investment strategy,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nNOTE: This story was originally published on August 28, 2019.\n\nReserve your ticket!
