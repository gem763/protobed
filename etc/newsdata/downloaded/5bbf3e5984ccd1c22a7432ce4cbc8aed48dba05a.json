Property developers were the biggest losers, with Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. poised for the largest drop in two months. The Hang Seng Index slid 0.9% below the key 26,000 point level. Hong Kong\u2019s markets are closed Monday for a holiday.\n\nSpeculation circulated widely before the briefing, which was attended by Lam and her 16 ministers. The concern was that any decision to invoke emergency laws could backfire, potentially angering protesters and spurring more violence. It could also jeopardize the city\u2019s standing as a global financial hub.\n\n\u201cEnacting this law might damage Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as city with freedom and a relatively stable market,\u201d said Jackson Wong, a director at Amber Hill Capital Ltd. \u201cThis may cool down the protests but it could also escalate actions taken by the hard-core demonstrators.\u201d\n\nHong Kong stocks just suffered the worst quarter in four years as investors priced in escalating local tensions and a worsening economy. Corporate earnings -- which are already under pressure from a protracted U.S.-China trade war and the weaker yuan -- are expected to contract the most since the global financial crisis this year.\n\nThe city\u2019s economy is showing the strain of months of protests, with data this week showing retail sales plunged a record amount in August. A recession could take the Hang Seng measure down another 25% by the end of 2020, according to Oreana Financial Services Ltd.\u2019s Isaac Poole.\n\nMTR Corp. slumped as much as 2.8%. The operator of Hong Kong\u2019s subway appealed to protesters to stop damaging facilities on the network. Some 800 access gates, 900 ticketing machines and 700 surveillance cameras have been broken during the four-month long protests, according to the firm.\n\n--With assistance from Elena Popina.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Richard Frost in Hong Kong at rfrost4@bloomberg.net;Jeanny Yu in Hong Kong at jyu107@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Sarah Wells at smcdonald23@bloomberg.net, Sofia Horta e Costa\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong stocks fell as the city\u2019s government said it will ban mask wearing in a bid to deter protesters after months of violence.The MSCI Hong Kong Index dropped 1.4% at 3:30 p.m., briefly paring losses as Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the new law does not mean the city is in an official", "authors": ["Richard Frost", "Jeanny Yu"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cQKz6O8MUGXJQxyO7ogSJQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/cf57d5dc88b5b3da2cb394652b07c596", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
