A program that went 67-32-6 in the 1960s, 75-39-3 in the 1970s, 77-37-4 in the 1980s, 99-22-2 in the 1990s (with a 1998 national championship), and 83-44 in the 2000s, heads for the blessed end of this decade at 56-60, a decade sure to be mourned for decades to come.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn many a college town, football victory can seem to sprout from civic craving, as if the public\u2019s thirst for major success serves to mandate that it happens \u2014 at least every now and then, if not at an Alabama rate. Somehow, even after 11 seasons of ricocheting between lukewarm, worse than lukewarm and the occasional turn of quite good, Tennessee has lost games during the last three seasons by 41, 38, 33, 20, 18, 26, 26, 26, 37, 33, 25 and 31 points.\n\nSomehow \u2014 there\u2019s that word again \u2014 none of those losses qualifies as the worst.\n\nThe worst came Aug. 31, when Georgia State, which ended last season with a 2-10 record and began this one with a helpful forecast of last place in the Sun Belt Conference, came to Neyland Stadium, beat the Volunteers, 38-30, and, probably even worse, in a case of near-blasphemy, outrushed them 213-93. It seemed they sort of pushed them around.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cCalling it an \u2018upset\u2019 doesn\u2019t do it justice,\u201d wrote John Adams, the estimable columnist and witness to just about everything under the football sun and clouds across the decades. \u201cThis was the worst loss in the modern era of Tennessee football.\u201d\n\nIt took a hopeful offseason and good recruiting season for Coach Jeremy Pruitt\u2019s second season, and it gave it a mean puncture.\n\nAs Georgia State moved on to lose, for example, 57-10 at Western Michigan, in came Brigham Young, which won at Neyland in overtime weeks before losing 28-21 at Toledo, not that Toledo has ever been the easiest. From there, the Vols won, 45-0, against Chattanooga of the Football Championship Subdivision, then lost, 34-3, at their fans\u2019 object of loathing, Florida of the SEC East Division.\n\nAD\n\nThe Kyle Trask Story: Six years as a backup QB, then a Hollywood debut for Florida\n\nThis has gone on for so long that it\u2019s possible to have made a trip to Knoxville in 2013 to discuss the malaise, to learn about how the difference between, say, 10-2, and, say, 5-7, matters deeply in apparel sales, in restaurant receipts.\n\nAD\n\nDid you know people don\u2019t buy as many programs for 5-7 teams?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s obvious, but people don\u2019t buy as many programs for 5-7 teams.\n\nSix years later, most of them really long, and through the 34-27 era of Butch Jones, Tennessee has reached this particular week, on which Adams writes, \u201cThe bar of UT football has dropped so low that raising the possibility of a competitive game against a ranked opponent seems far-fetched.\u201d No matter whom one blames, it\u2019s just about mysterious that this could happen for so long, given the public\u2019s great interest.\n\nAD\n\nAll the way into this week, it seemed prudent to check in on some Knoxville talk radio, still a worthwhile endeavor even in Twitter days because it includes the persistent sound of human voices.\n\n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m dreading for Saturday,\u201d said Heather Harrington on WNML, \u201cis for it to be 35-nothing at halftime. And that\u2019s what I fear is coming.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s when sitting in the upper reaches of a stadium so vivid in its days of fullness could reveal some compelling sights and sounds.\n\nOf course, some of the talk centered around the case of linebacker Jeremy Banks, who in the middle of the night of Sept. 15 had a set-to with the police involving an improper U-turn, during which he was arrested on an outstanding warrant for failing to appear in court for an earlier citation. Banks has apologized profusely for directing profanity toward the officers, but the whole thing wound up with Pruitt on tape from the phone call with police, wondering why Banks was arrested and saying, \u201cI\u2019ve worked at four places, and I ain\u2019t never had no crap like this except for here.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt\u2019s some week, among many some weeks, and it even includes glory-days coach Phillip Fulmer, the athletic director, trying to quell rampant chatter by saying, at age 69, \u201cThe coaching chapter of my life is long closed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAn objective heart might weep, and Tennessee fans still investing whole hearts after all this would qualify among the best fans extant. One of them called Pruitt\u2019s show Wednesday night and made what seemed a serious pitch to walk on as a middle linebacker.\n\nOn Jimmy Hyams and John Wilkerson\u2019s show Thursday afternoon, a caller named Joe doubtless spoke for many. He talked for a while about the Banks arrest and how Banks might utilize it to spur him toward the better. He closed with, \u201cI love my Tennessee Vols, and like I tell people, it\u2019s gonna be hard, it\u2019s gonna be a long road to get back to where we need to be.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe added: \u201cOnly silver lining, Auburn\u2019s going to Florida and they\u2019re gonna destroy them.\u201d\n\nIt has come to wishing for such morsels of distant pleasure. Now comes Georgia, as it did two years ago, in a match that looked somewhat curious in advance of itself. Then Georgia, ratcheted to a new level under Coach Kirby Smart, demolished Tennessee, 41-0, in a fresh statement of the reality of the SEC East.\n\nAD\n\nThat, too, could have been an edifying day to sit way up top.\n\nRead more:\n\nAnalysis: Auburn deserves to be No. 1 in college football rankings\n\nD-III football players say choice to forfeit season after injuries was theirs, not college\u2019s\n\nMaryland readies for Rutgers knowing the threat of a team with nothing to lose\n\nAurora, the Air Force Academy\u2019s \u2018majestic\u2019 and \u2018feisty\u2019 live falcon mascot, dies at the age of 23\n\nSally Jenkins: California law doesn\u2019t take from the NCAA.
