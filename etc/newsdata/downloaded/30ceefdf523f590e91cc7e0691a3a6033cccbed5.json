Belgium, Italy and Spain all have 100 per cent records, while Ukraine have not lost a game but host Portugal next.\n\nThe final two Euro 2020 seeds are likely to be contested by England, who face Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday night, Holland or Germany and Turkey or France.", "description": "England have put their chance of securing a top-seed place at next summer\u2019s European Championships in jeopardy by suffering the shock defeat against Czech Republic.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Jason Burt", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000212775018-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqnUiTmmnqkT0SZ61l8CNZFj3pj2s3dGWLt-Pm2f5LGUo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
