The Montessori Route\n\nShutterstock\n\nI'm a self-proclaimed minimalist, so I tend to try and find ways not to just teach about financial responsibility, but responsibility with ones time, energy, and stuff. Having too much \"stuff\" has its own consequences, just like having too little. A lot of my belief aligns well with Montessori principles, and thus had a conversation with a colleague years ago that completely shaped my approach with the kiddos:\n\nHe grew up going to Montessori through high school and his parents were big believers in the principles especially when it comes to equipping independence. From that stemmed an incremental independence structure they setup for him and his sister. They started at year 0 (Kindergarten), and sat down and created a list of responsibilities they have on behalf of their children and on behalf of their household. Then they juxtaposed cost against those items.\n\nFor example, on behalf of young children you buy clothes and wash them, buy groceries and cook them, and prepare their school stuff/fill out forms/etc.\n\nOn behalf of the house, they cleaned, did laundry and performed yard work.\n\nThey ranked the activities based on complexity, time required to perform, and reasonable age a child is able to manage the activity. They then assigned a cost to those items calculated from things like \"what it would cost to outsource this activity, like a maid\" and what someone of their education level would average being paid out in the open market. Items that were self serving (buying clothes) were only assigned budget for the items, not for the work of doing it.\n\nThen, each year, starting in kindergarten, they'd give them the activities aligned with the age and the budget required to do it. For example, in kindergarten, they'd give the kid responsibility of taking all their laundry to the laundry room and sorting it, or picking up around the house. Then, at the end of the week, they'd \"pay\" them for their work. If the work wasn't completed, they wouldn't get it.\n\nAs they got older, they took on ownership of small budgets, for things like clothing and eventually budget for lunch. My friend's dad allotted him $300 on jan1 after his 10th birthday and told him that moving forward he would be responsible for planning and purchasing his own clothing. This came from a conversation (argument) about a pair of shoes he really wanted. So his dad realized it was time he learned about his clothing budget. He quickly bought the shoes, and ended up spending most of his budget early in the year and when winter came, he had to wear a small jacket because he ran out of money.\n\nNeedless to say, he learned very quickly about planning for back to school shopping, and ensuring you have enough money for September, when you're planning in January.\n\nAnyway, my point of this story is that just like money is a conduit for necessity, the introductions to money should be a conduit to independence and money management. I think save/spend/give is important, but how to spend (budgeting) and how to save, are the key lessons and so much of why so many people have issues with money. They didn't grow up practicing with small amounts of money, so it became daunting when they got grown up amounts of money.\n\nTo conclude the story, by the time my friend was in high school, he managed the family grocery budget, his own clothing and school budget and even began dabbling in investing with his dad (started his first IRA) with his extra budget money. He got a credit card in 9th grade and learned early what would happen if he didn't pay it off on time. He also learned to manage his accounts because all the money he received was given to him in an account. He also learned about credit card rewards and the benefits of different cards.\n\nHe even learned to bargain with his sister for her work, so he would get her money, for activities like school trips and going out with friends. Once he realized there was a cap to what he could earn at home, he realized he had other skills that could earn him money outside the home and he got his first job and started his first business.\n\nI think his dad was a genius by setting up a home economy that aligned with some real world numbers that let the children learn early on how much things are worth, how much effort certain things take, how much time these things take (and in turn respect for their parents and what they do!) and how money is either a tool or a curse depending on what you do with it.\n\nToday he is financially independent at 35 years old, and a senior software dev manager. He lives very minimally with his girlfriend in Seattle, in a one bedroom condo he bought and paid off, has no car, and spends his money traveling, enjoying the outdoors and eating well and giving back what extra he has that he doesn't need.\n\nKudos to his dad!!! I'm taking notes for my own kiddos.\n\n\u2013 Jenny", "description": "When personal-finance blog Budgets Are Sexy asked its readers how they manage allowance for their children, responses poured in.", "authors": ["J.
