And could even ban bitcoin,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cNot expecting it. But with current White House, there is \u201cnothing out of bounds nor out of reach.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement on Wednesday, the US government and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are determined to eradicate e-cigarettes, at least temporarily, in order to assess their safety.\n\nComplaints allege manufacturers such as Juul are deliberately targeting underage consumers with nicotine-based products. Reports of a \u201cmystery\u201d lung disease on the rise have exacerbated demands for a ban.\n\nNow, flavored e-cigarettes will no longer be available for purchase legally, and must be withdrawn within 30 days.\n\nAgreement On $100K Bitcoin Ban\n\nContinuing the debate about the likelihood of a Bitcoin ban, Lee argued government temperament directly depended on price.\n\nTrump tweeted his dislike for cryptocurrency when BTC/USD circled $10,500. Should it become worth ten times that he said, the Trump administration would be much more likely to forbid US residents to use it.\n\n\u201cTrue, agree,\u201d he wrote in response to another Twitter user who forecast the $100,000 ban.\n\nWhile the concept of a state outlawing the supposedly \u2018unbannable\u2019 decentralized Bitcoin often sparks anger, little evidence has emerged of how governments would apply such a law.\n\nAttention currently focuses on India in particular, where authorities have repeatedly called for the criminalization of any cryptocurrency not approved by them.\n\nWhile some dismissed the idea as unworkable by default, Delhi sparked considerable anger from the industry. Tim Draper, the billionaire investor and supporter of Bitcoin and Blockchain project Tezos, called India\u2019s government corrupt.\n\n\u201cThey are in fact saying, \u2018we will not tolerate progress.\u2019 It will set them back 40 years,\u201d he said in July.\n\nDo you think the US would ban Bitcoin at $100,000?
