(AP) - Falcons rookie guard Chris Lindstrom, the No. 14 overall draft pick, has a broken foot and will spend the next eight weeks on injured reserve.\n\nLindstrom, a former Boston College standout who quickly won the right guard job in spring, was hurt in Sunday\u2019s season-opening loss at Minnesota. He left in the third quarter and didn\u2019t return.\n\nLindstrom will undergo surgery this week and is eligible to return to game action in Week 10 at New Orleans.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have been more pleased with his start as a Falcon in terms of what he\u2019s going to bring to our team,\u201d coach Dan Quinn said. \u201cI\u2019m bummed we\u2019re going to lose him for a period of time.\u201d\n\nQuinn said Jamon Brown will likely start at right guard with Wes Schweitzer providing depth. Brown, who signed an $18.75 million, three-year contract in free agency, lost the left guard job to James Carpenter last week.\n\nThe Falcons signed offensive lineman John Wetzel to take Lindstrom\u2019s spot on the roster. Wetzel was released by Atlanta in the final wave of preseason cuts. He originally signed as an undrafted free agent with Oakland in 2013 and played in 40 games with 24 starts for Arizona.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Falcons rookie guard Chris Lindstrom, the No. 14 overall draft pick, has a broken foot and will spend the next eight weeks on injured reserve.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
