One of them is a massive, multi-million-dollar enterprise filled with violence and betrayal, and the other aired on HBO. I find it hard to explain why exactly, and I\u2019m sure Swift would, too: Somehow, this one 29-year-old woman from Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, keeps finding herself at the center of our national conversations about race, gender, celebrity, victimhood, even the economics of the tech industry. And, outside the legions of fans who eat up everything she puts out, no take on her ever stays solid for long. She was a precocious teenager, and the ultimate embodiment of white privilege. She\u2019s been feminism\u2019s worst nightmare, and an advocate for victims of sexual assault. Some people say she\u2019s a goddess of the alt-right. Other people say she\u2019s Jewish.\n\nAnd yet, unlike Madonna or Bowie, Swift got through the first 11 years of her career without any major reinventions. (For 1989, she embraced feminism and threw away the last vestiges of her Nashville sound, but those were basically just aesthetic changes.) If the word on her has shifted since her debut, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve changed, not her. Swift \u2014 or at least the version of Swift on her albums \u2014 has remained largely the same person since her debut: a thin-skinned, bighearted obsessive, with a penchant for huge romantic moments. People don\u2019t slowly ease into a relationship in her songs; they show up at each other\u2019s doors late at night and they kiss in the rain. An unworthy suitor won\u2019t just say something thoughtless; he\u2019ll skip a birthday party or leave a teenage girl crying alone in a hotel room. Listen to her songs and you\u2019ll ache at the resemblance to the most dramatic moments in your own private history. Listen to too many and you might ache again at the nagging feeling that those stories of yours have all been a bit uneventful and drab by comparison. What sort of real life can stand up against fantasies like these?\n\nSo, uh, I don\u2019t recommend you listen to this list top to bottom.\n\nBut I do recommend sampling as many of these songs as you see fit. Even with the widespread critical embrace of poptimism \u2014 a development I suspect has as much to do with the economics of online media as it does with the shifting winds of taste \u2014 there are still those who see Swift as just another industry widget, a Miley or Katy with the tuner set to \u201cgirl with a guitar.\u201d If this list does anything, I hope it convinces you that, underneath all the thinkpieces, exes, and feuds, she is one of our era\u2019s great singer-songwriters. She may not have the raw vocal power of some of her competitors, but what she lacks in Mariah-level range she makes up for in versatility and personality. (A carpetbagger from the Pennsylvania suburbs, she became an expert code-switcher early in her career and never looked back.) And when it comes to writing instantly memorable pop songs, her only peers are a few anonymous Swedish guys, none of whom perform their own stuff. I count at least ten stone-cold classics in her discography. Others might see more. No matter how high your defenses, I guarantee you\u2019ll find at least one that breaks them down.\n\nSome ground rules: We\u2019re ranking every Taylor Swift song that\u2019s ever been released with her name on it \u2014 which means we must sadly leave out the unreleased 9/11 song \u201cDidn\u2019t They\u201d as well as Nils Sj\u00f6berg\u2019s \u201cThis Is What You Came For\u201d \u2014 excluding tracks where Swift is merely \u201cfeatured\u201d (no one\u2019s reading this list for B.o.B.\u2019s \u201cBoth of Us\u201d) but includinga few duets where she gets an \u201cand\u201d credit. Songwriting is an important part of Swift\u2019s spellbook, so covers are treated more harshly than originals. Because Swift\u2019s career began so young, we\u2019re left in the awkward position of judging work done by a literal high-schooler, which can feel at times like punching down. I\u2019ll try to make slight allowances for age, reserving the harshest criticism for the songs written when Swift was an adult millionaire.\n\n*This post was originally published in November 2017. It has been updated to include Swift\u2019s subsequent releases. Additionally, some rankings have changed to reflect the author\u2019s evolving taste.\n\n142. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Reputation (2017): \u201cThere\u2019s a mistake that I see artists make when they\u2019re on their fourth or fifth record, and they think innovation is more important than solid songwriting,\u201d Swift told New York back in 2013. \u201cThe most terrible letdown as a listener for me is when I\u2019m listening to a song and I see what they were trying to do.\u201d To Swift\u2019s credit, it took her six records to get to this point. On a conceptual level, the mission here is clear: After the Kim-Kanye feud made her the thinking person\u2019s least-favorite pop star, this comeback single would be her grand heel turn. But the villain costume sits uneasily on Swift\u2019s shoulders, and even worse, the songwriting just isn\u2019t there. The verses are vacuous, the insults have no teeth, and just when the whole thing seems to be leading up to a gigantic redemptive chorus, suddenly pop! The air goes out of it and we\u2019re left with a taunting Right Said Fred reference \u2014 the musical equivalent of pulling a Looney Tunes gag on the listener. Other Swift songs have clunkier rhymes, or worse production values, but none of them have such a gaping hole at the center. (I do dig the gleeful \u201cCuz she\u2019s dead!\u201d though.)\n\n141. \u201cUmbrella,\u201d iTunes Live From Soho (2008): Swift has recorded plenty of covers in her career, and none are less essential than this 90-second rendition of the Rihanna hit recorded at the peak of the song\u2019s popularity. It\u2019s pure college-campus coffeehouse.\n\n140. \u201cChristmas Must Mean Something More,\u201d The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection(2007): One of two originals on Swift\u2019s early-career Christmas album, \u201cSomething More\u201d is a plea to put the Christ back in Christmas. Or as she puts it: \u201cWhat if happiness came in a cardboard box? / Then I think there is something we all forgot.\u201d In the future, Swift would get better at holding onto some empathy when she was casting a critical eye at the silly things people care about; here, the vibe is judgmental in a way that will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s ever reread their teenage diary.\n\n139. \u201cBetter Than Revenge,\u201d Speak Now (2010): A nasty little song that has not aged well. Whether a straightforward imitation of Avril Lavigne\u2019s style or an early attempt at \u201cBlank Space\u201d\u2013style self-satirization, the barbs never go beyond bratty. (As in \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the revenge turns out to be the song itself, which feels hollow.) Best known now for the line about \u201cthe things she does on the mattress,\u201d which I suspect has been cited in blog posts more times than the song itself has been listened to lately.\n\n138. \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d Non-album digital single (2009): Why would you cover this song and make it slower?\n\n137. \u201cI Want You Back,\u201d Speak Now World Tour \u2013 Live (2011): Another 90-second cover of a pop song that does not particularly benefit from a stripped-down arrangement.\n\n136. \u201cSanta Baby,\u201d The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection (2007): Before Ariana Grande\u2019s \u201cSanta Tell Me,\u201d there was only one holiday song about falling in love with Santa, and for some reason, we spent decades making all our young female singers cover it. Swift\u2019s version leans out of the awkwardness by leaning into the materialism; she puts most of her vocal emphasis on the nice presents she hopes Santa will bring her. (The relationship seems to be fairly quid pro quo: She\u2019ll believe in him if he gives her good gifts \u2014 even at this early stage, Swift possessed a savvy business sense.) Otherwise, this is a by-the-numbers holiday cover, complete with sleigh bells in the mix.\n\n135. \u201cSweet Escape,\u201d Speak Now World Tour \u2013 Live; Target edition DVD (2011): Swift\u2019s sedate cover of the 2006 Gwen Stefani hit \u2014 those \u201cooh-ooh\u201ds are pitched way down from Akon\u2019s falsetto in the original \u2014 invests the song with a bittersweet vibe, though like anyone who\u2019s ever tried the song at karaoke, she stumbles on the rapid-fire triplets in the first verse.\n\n134. \u201cSilent Night,\u201d The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection (2007): Swift\u2019s cover of the Christmas classic veers significantly away from Franz Xaver Gruber\u2019s original melody, and even gives it a Big Taylor Swift Finale. Points for ambition, but sometimes you just want to hear the old standards the way you remember them.\n\n133. \u201cThe Last Time,\u201d Red (2012): Red is Swift\u2019s strongest album, but it suffers a bit from pacing issues: The back half is full of interminable ballads that you\u2019ve got to slog through to get to the end. Worst of all is this duet with po-faced Ulsterman Gary Lightbody, which feels about ten minutes long.\n\n132. \u201cInvisible,\u201d Taylor Swift: Special Edition (2006): A bonus track from the debut that plays like a proto\u2013\u201dYou Belong With Me.\u201d The \u201cshow you\u201d / \u201cknow you\u201d rhymes mark this as an early effort.\n\n131. \u201c\u2026Ready for It?,\u201d Reputation (2017): The second straight misfire off the Reputation rollout, this one sees Swift try her hand at rapping, with some ill-advised bars about Elizabeth Taylor and a flow she borrowed from Jay-Z. (Try to rap \u201cYounger than my exes\u201d without spilling into \u201crest in peace, Bob Marley.\u201d) Bumped up a spot or two for the chorus, a big Swift hook that sounds just like her best work \u2014 in this case, because it bites heavily from \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d\n\n130. \u201cI Heart ?,\u201d Beautiful Eyes EP (2008): Swift code-switches like a champ on this charmingly shallow country song, which comes from the Walmart-exclusive EP she released between her first two albums. Her vocals get pretty rough in the chorus, but at least we\u2019re left with the delightful line, \u201cWake up and smell the breakup.\u201d\n\n129. \u201cBad Blood,\u201d 1989 (2014): When Swift teamed up with Max Martin and Shellback, the marriage of their dark eldritch songcraft nearly broke the pop charts. But when they misfire, the results can be brutal. The lyric here indulges the worst habits of late-period Swift \u2014 an eagerness to play the victim, a slight lack of resemblance to anything approaching real life \u2014 attached to a schoolyard-chant melody that will never leave your head, even when you may want it to. The remix hollows out the production and replaces Swift\u2019s verses with two from Kendrick Lamar; it\u2019s less embarrassing than the original, which does not make it more memorable.\n\n128. \u201cWhite Christmas,\u201d The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection (2007): The most bluegrass of Swift\u2019s Christmas tunes, this gentle rendition sees Swift\u2019s vocals cede center stage to the mandolin and fiddle.\n\n127. \u201cCrazier,\u201d Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack (2009): When approached by the filmmakers about contributing a song to the Hannah Montana movie, Swift sent in this track, seemingly a holdover from the Fearless sessions. In an admirable bit of dedication, she also showed up to play it in the film\u2019s climax. It\u2019s kind of a snooze on its own, but compared to the other songs on the soundtrack, even Swift\u2019s leftovers shine.\n\n126. \u201cI\u2019d Lie,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): A bonus track only available to people who bought Swift\u2019s debut at Best Buy. It\u2019s as cute as a study-hall MASH game, and just as easily disposable.\n\n125. \u201cHighway Don\u2019t Care,\u201d Tim McGraw\u2019s Two Lanes of Freedom (2013): After joining Big Machine, McGraw gave Swift an \u201cand\u201d credit here as a professional courtesy. Though her backing vocals are very pleasant, this is 100 percent a Tim McGraw song.\n\n124. \u201cSuperman,\u201d Speak Now: Deluxe Edition (2010): A bonus track that\u2019s not gonna make anyone forget Five for Fighting any time soon.\n\n123. \u201cChange,\u201d Fearless (2008): A bit of paint-by-numbers inspiration that apparently did its job of spurring the 2008 U.S. Olympic team to greatness. They won 36 gold medals!\n\n122. \u201cMe!,\u201d Lover (2019): Well, what did we expect? The run-up to \u201cMe!\u201d was preceded by a weeks-long guessing game about what precisely would be the nature of Swift\u2019s big announcement on April 26, 2019. Would she come out? Would she come out and reveal she had once dated Karlie Kloss? Cut to the fateful day, and the news was \u2026 Swift, who is a pop singer, was releasing a new pop song. After the Sturm und Drang of the Reputation era, \u201cMe!\u201d is a return to anodyne sweetness, a mission statement that says, \u201cI\u2019m through making mission statements.\u201d When it comes to reclaiming a sense of youthful innocence, the song is probably too successful \u2014 the we\u2019re-all-just-kids-having-fun vibe aims for cheesy and lands at grating.\n\n121. \u201cEnd Game,\u201d Reputation (2017): Swift tries out her blaccent alongside Future and Ed Sheeran, on a track that sounds unmistakably like a Rihanna reject. The only silver lining? She\u2019s better at rapping here than on \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d\n\n120. \u201cThe Lucky One,\u201d Red (2012): A plight-of-fame ballad from the back half of Red, with details that never rise above clich\u00e9 and a melody that borrows from the one Swift cooked up for \u201cUntouchable.\u201d\n\n119. \u201cA Place in This World,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): Swift\u2019s version of \u201cNot a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,\u201d this one feels like it missed its chance to be the theme tune for an ABC Family show.\n\n118. \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever,\u201d Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack (2017): In Fifty Shades Darker, this wan duet soundtracks a scene where Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele go for a sunny boat ride while wearing fabulous sweaters. On brand!\n\n117. \u201cLast Christmas,\u201d The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection (2007): Swift does George Michael proud with this reverent cover of the Wham! classic.\n\n116. \u201cBreathless,\u201d Hope for Haiti Now (2010): Swift covered this Better Than Ezra deep cut for the Hope for Haiti telethon. With only one take to get it right, she did not let the people of Haiti down.\n\n115. \u201cBette Davis Eyes,\u201d Speak Now World Tour \u2013 Live (2012): \u201cThere\u2019s some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from L.A., did you know that?\u201d Swift asks the audience at the beginning of this live track. The crowd, not being idiots, responds with an enthusiastic yes. This cover loses the two most famous parts of Kim Carnes\u2019s original \u2014 the synths and Carnes\u2019s throaty delivery \u2014 but the acoustic arrangement and Swift\u2019s intimate vocals bring out the best qualities of the tune.\n\n114. \u201cEyes Open,\u201d The Hunger Games: Songs From District 12 and Beyond (2012): One of two songs Swift contributed to the first Hunger Games soundtrack. With guitars seemingly ripped straight out of 1998 alt-rock radio, this one\u2019s most interesting now as a preview of Swift\u2019s Red sound.\n\n113. \u201cBeautiful Eyes,\u201d Beautiful Eyes EP (2008): The title track of Swift\u2019s early-career EP finds the young songwriter getting a lot of mileage out of one single vowel sound: Besides the eyes of the title, we\u2019ve got I, why, fly, cry, lullaby, even sometimes. A spirited vocal performance in the outro saves the song from feeling like homework.\n\n112. \u201cThe Outside,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): If you thought you felt weird judging songs by a high-schooler, here\u2019s one by an actual sixth-grader. \u201cThe Outside\u201d was the second song Swift ever wrote, and though the lyrics edge into self-pity at times, this is still probably the best song written by a 12-year-old since Mozart\u2019s \u201cSymphony No. 7 in D Major.\u201d\n\n111. \u201cSuperStar,\u201d Fearless: Platinum Edition (2008): This bonus track is a relic of an unfamiliar time when Swift could conceivably be the less-famous person in a relationship.\n\n110. \u201cStarlight,\u201d Red (2012): Never forget that one of the most critically acclaimed albums of 2012 contains a piece of Ethel Kennedy fanfiction. The real story of Bobby and Ethel has more rough spots than you\u2019ll find in this resolutely rose-colored track, but that\u2019s what happens when you spend a summer hanging in Hyannis Port.\n\n109. \u201cSad Beautiful Tragic,\u201d Red (2012): Another glacially paced song from the back half of Red that somehow pulls off rhyming \u201cmagic\u201d with \u201ctragic.\u201d\n\n108. \u201cInnocent,\u201d Speak Now (2010): The disparate reactions to Kanye West stage-crashing Swift at the 2009 VMAs speaks to the Rorschachian nature of Swift\u2019s star image. Was Swift a teenage girl whose moment was ruined by an older man who couldn\u2019t control himself? Or was she a white woman playing the victim to demonize an outspoken black man? Both are correct, which is why everyone\u2019s spent so much time arguing about it. Unfortunately, Swift did herself no favors when she premiered \u201cInnocent\u201d at the next year\u2019s VMAs, opening with footage of the incident, which couldn\u2019t help but feel like she was milking it. (Fairly or not, the comparison to West\u2019s own artistic response hardly earns any points in the song\u2019s favor.) Stripped of all this context, \u201cInnocent\u201d is fine: Swift turns in a tender vocal performance, though the lyrics could stand to be less patronizing.\n\n107. \u201cGirl at Home,\u201d Red: Deluxe Edition (2012): This Red bonus track offers a foreshadowing of Swift\u2019s interest in sparkly \u201980s-style production. A singsongy melody accompanies a largely forgettable lyric, except for one hilariously blunt line: \u201cIt would be a fine proposition \u2026 if I was a stupid girl.\u201d\n\n106. \u201cA Perfectly Good Heart,\u201d Taylor Swift: Special Edition (2006): A pleading breakup song with one killer turn of phrase and not much else.\n\n105. \u201cI Think He Knows,\u201d Lover (2019): Not, as the title might imply, a slinky cheating ballad. Instead, it\u2019s a straightforward love song. The stripped-down production in the verses makes a fun contrast with the bubbly chorus, but otherwise there\u2019s not much here.\n\n104. \u201cMary\u2019s Song (Oh My Oh My),\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): This early track was inspired by Swift\u2019s elderly neighbors. Like \u201cStarlight,\u201d it\u2019s a young person\u2019s vision of lifelong love, skipping straight from proposal to old age.\n\n103. \u201cCome in With the Rain,\u201d Fearless: Platinum Edition (2008): An ode to a long-lost lover that follows the Swift template a tad too slavishly.\n\n102. \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied,\u201d Reputation (2017): Reputation sags a bit in the middle, never more than on this forgettable \u201980s-inspired track.\n\n101. \u201cDeath by a Thousand Cuts,\u201d Lover (2019): Apparently inspired by a Netflix rom-com, and that tells you everything you need to know.\n\n100. \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d 1989 (2014): In retrospect, there could not have been a song more perfectly designed to tick off the authenticity police \u2014 didn\u2019t Swift know that real New Yorkers stayed up till 3 a.m. doing drugs with Fabrizio Moretti in the bathroom of Mars Bar? I hope you\u2019re sitting down when I tell you this, but it\u2019s possible the initial response to a Taylor Swift song might have been a little reactionary. When it\u2019s not taken as a mission statement, \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d is totally tolerable, a glimmering confetti throwaway with lovely synths.\n\n99. \u201cTied Together With a Smile,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): When she was just a teenager with a development deal, Swift hooked up with veteran Nashville songwriter Liz Rose. The two would collaborate on much of Swift\u2019s first two albums. \u201cWe wrote and figured out that it really worked. She figured out she could write Taylor Swift songs, and I wouldn\u2019t get in the way,\u201d Rose said later. \u201cShe\u2019d say a line and I\u2019d say, \u2018What if we say it like this?\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like editing.\u201d This early ballad about a friend with bulimia sees Swift and Rose experimenting with metaphor. Most of them work.\n\n98. \u201cCome Back \u2026 Be Here,\u201d Red: Deluxe Edition (2012): A vulnerable track about long-distance love, with simple sentiments overwhelmed by extravagant production.\n\n97. \u201cBreathe,\u201d Fearless (2008): A Colbie Caillat collaboration that\u2019s remarkable mostly for being a rare Swift song about a friend breakup. It\u2019s like if \u201cBad Blood\u201d contained actual human emotions.\n\n96. \u201cFalse God,\u201d Lover (2019): A woozy R&B track livened up by an undaunted vocal performance and a saxophonist really making the most of their time in the spotlight.\n\n95. \u201cStay Beautiful,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): Nathan Chapman was a Nashville session guitarist before he started working with Swift. He produced her early demos, and she fought for him to sit behind the controls on her debut; the two would work together on every Swift album until 1989, when his role was largely taken over by Max Martin and Shellback. Here, he brings a sprightly arrangement to Swift\u2019s ode to an achingly good-looking man.\n\n94. \u201cNashville,\u201d Speak Now World Tour \u2013 Live; Target edition DVD (2011): Swift gives some shine to singer-songwriter David Mead with a cover of his 2004 ballad. (Listen to the screams during the chorus and try to guess where this one was recorded.) She treats it with a delicate respect, like she\u2019s handling her grandmother\u2019s china.\n\n93. \u201cSo It Goes,\u201d Reputation (2017): Unfortunately not a Nick Lowe cover, this one comes and goes without making much of an impact, but if you don\u2019t love that whispered \u201c1-2-3,\u201d I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\n\n92. \u201cYou\u2019re Not Sorry,\u201d Fearless (2008): An unflinching kiss-off song that got a gothic remix for Swift\u2019s appearance as an ill-fated teen on CSI. It shouldn\u2019t work, but it does.\n\n91. \u201cDrops of Jupiter,\u201d Speak Now World Tour \u2013 Live (2012): The best of the covers on the live album sees Swift commit to the Train hit like she\u2019d written it herself. If you had forgotten that this song came out in 2001, she keeps the line about Tae Bo.\n\n90. \u201cThe Other Side of the Door,\u201d Fearless: Platinum Edition (2008): A bonus track saved from mediocrity by a gutsy outro that hints that Swift, like any good millennial, was a big fan of \u201cSemi-Charmed Life.\u201d\n\n89. \u201cYou Need to Calm Down,\u201d Lover (2019): The song where Swift came out as an LGBTQ ally and buried the hatchet with Katy Perry, all at the same time. The slangy Trump jabs (to say nothing of the slight West Indian accents in the chorus) may read as a few years behind the times, but when it comes to straight pop stars penning gay-rights theme songs, you could do a lot worse.\n\n88. \u201cI Wish You Would,\u201d 1989 (2014): Like \u201cYou Are in Love,\u201d this one originated as a Jack Antonoff instrumental track, and the finished version retains his fingerprints. Perhaps too much \u2014 you get the sense it might work better as a Bleachers song.\n\n87. \u201cKing of My Heart,\u201d Reputation (2017): Swift is fond of saying that \u201csongs are what you think of on the drive home \u2014 you know, the Great Afterthought.\u201d (She says it\u2019s a Joni Mitchell quote, but I haven\u2019t been able to find it.) Anyway, I think that\u2019s why some of the love songs on Reputation don\u2019t quite land: Swift is writing about a relationship from inside of it, instead of with hindsight. It\u2019s a different skill, which could explain why the boyfriend character here is less vividly sketched than some of her other ones.\n\n86. \u201cCold As You,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): A dead-serious breakup song that proved the teenage Swift (with help from Rose, who\u2019s got a co-writing credit) could produce barbs sharper than most adults: \u201cYou come away with a great little story / Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.\u201d Jesus.\n\n85. \u201cHaunted,\u201d Speak Now (2010): In which Swift tries her hand at Evanescence-style goth-rock. She almost pulls it off, but at this point in Swift\u2019s career her voice wasn\u2019t quite strong enough to give the unrestrained performance the song calls for.\n\n84. \u201cThis Love,\u201d 1989 (2014): Began life as a poem before evolving into an atmospheric 1989 deep cut. Like an imperfectly poached egg, it\u2019s shapeless but still quite appetizing.\n\n83. \u201cUntouchable,\u201d Fearless: Platinum Edition (2008): Technically a Luna Halo cover (don\u2019t worry about it), though Swift discards everything but the bones of the original. Her subsequent renovation job is worthy of HGTV: It\u2019s nearly impossible to believe this was ever not a Taylor Swift song.\n\n82. \u201cDaylight,\u201d Lover (2019): When it comes to ending an album on a note of catharsis and elemental imagery, I prefer \u201cClean.\u201d And when it comes to employing this specific melody and cadence in a refrain, I prefer Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cHalo.\u201d But I do love a good spoken-word mission statement!\n\n81. \u201cWonderland,\u201d 1989: Deluxe Edition (2014): A deranged bonus track that sees Swift doing the absolute most. This song has everything: Alice in Wonderland metaphors, Rihanna chants, a zigzag bridge that recalls \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d screams. As she puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s all fun and games \u2019til somebody loses their MIND!\u201d\n\n80. \u201cSweeter Than Fiction,\u201d One Chance soundtrack (2013): Swift\u2019s first collaboration with Jack Antonoff is appropriately \u201980s-inspired, and so sugary that a well-placed key change in the chorus is the only thing that staves off a toothache.\n\n79. \u201cI\u2019m Only Me When I\u2019m With You,\u201d Taylor Swift: Special Edition (2006): A rollicking pop-rock tune that recalls early Kelly Clarkson. As if to reassure nervous country fans, the fiddle goes absolutely nuts.\n\n78. \u201cTell Me Why,\u201d Fearless (2008): A bog-standard tale of an annoyingly clueless guy, but it\u2019s paired with one of Swift and Rose\u2019s most winning melodies.\n\n77. \u201cGorgeous,\u201d Reputation (2017): In the misbegotten rollout for Reputation, \u201cGorgeous\u201d righted the ship by not being completely terrible. Max Martin and Shellback pack the track with all sorts of amusing audio doodads, but the melody is a little too horizontal to stick, and the lyrics have a touch of first draft about them. (You\u2019d be forgiven for preferring the actual first draft, which is slightly more open and real.)\n\n76. \u201cIf This Was a Movie,\u201d Speak Now: Deluxe Edition (2010): The mirror image of \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d which makes it feel oddly superfluous.\n\n75. \u201cHow You Get the Girl,\u201d 1989 (2014): The breeziest and least complicated of Swift\u2019s guy-standing-on-a-doorstep songs, which contributed to the feeling that 1989 was something of an emotional regression. You probably shouldn\u2019t take it as an instruction manual unless you\u2019re Harry Styles.\n\n74. \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me,\u201d Reputation (2017): A woozy if slightly anonymous love song that comes off as a sexier \u201cTake Me to Church.\u201d [A dozen Hozier fans storm out of the room.]\n\n73. \u201cIt\u2019s Nice to Have a Friend,\u201d Lover (2019): Much of the pleasure here comes via a sample from a Toronto music academy, a steel-drum-and-chorus beat that sounds like nothing else in Swift\u2019s discography. The schoolyard vibe fits the playground-romance lyrics; I assume any resemblance to the plot of Carol is accidental.\n\n72. \u201cThe Way I Loved You,\u201d Fearless (2008): Written in collaboration with Big and Rich\u2019s John Rich, which may explain how stately and mid-tempo this one is. (There\u2019s even a martial drumbeat.) Here, she\u2019s faced with a choice between a too-perfect guy \u2014 he\u2019s close to her mother and talks business with her father \u2014 and a tempestuous relationship full of \u201cscreaming and fighting and kissing in the rain,\u201d and if you don\u2019t know which one she prefers I suggest you listen to more Taylor Swift songs. Swift often plays guessing games about which parts of her songs are autobiographical, but this one is explicitly a fantasy.\n\n71. \u201cNew Romantics,\u201d 1989: Deluxe Edition (2014): Like \u201c22,\u201d an attempt at writing a big generational anthem. That it was left off the album proper suggests Swift didn\u2019t think it quite got there, though it did its job of extending the singles cycle of 1989 a few more months. Despite what anyone says about \u201cWelcome to New York,\u201d the line here about waiting for \u201ctrains that just aren\u2019t coming\u201d indicates its writer has had at least one authentic New York experience.\n\n70. \u201cLondon Boy,\u201d Lover (2019): The song that gave the entire United Kingdom a chance to clown on Taylor Swift, which is the best gift the nation has received from an American since FDR\u2019s Lend-Lease program. It\u2019s utterly daffy, but as the product of a similar infatuation, it would be disingenuous of me to pretend I don\u2019t see the appeal. Oi, leave it!\n\n69. \u201cSparks Fly,\u201d Speak Now (2010): This one dates back to Swift\u2019s high-school days, and was destined for obscurity until fans fell in love with the live version. After what seems like a lot of tinkering, it finally got a proper studio release on Swift\u2019s third album. It\u2019s like \u201cTrue Love Waits,\u201d but with more kissing in the rain.\n\n68. \u201cAll You Had to Do Was Stay,\u201d 1989 (2014): Just like the melody to \u201cYesterday\u201d and the \u201cSatisfaction\u201d riff, the high-pitched \u201cStay!\u201d here came to its writer in a dream. Inspiration works in mysterious ways.\n\n67. \u201cStay Stay Stay,\u201d Red (2012): Swift broke out her southern accent one last time for this attempt at homespun folk, which is marred by production that\u2019s so clean it\u2019s practically antiseptic. In an alternate universe where a less-ambitious Swift took a 9-to-5 job writing ad jingles, this one soundtracked a TV spot for the new AT&T family plan.\n\n66. \u201cOurs,\u201d Speak Now: Deluxe Edition (2010): It\u2019s not this song\u2019s fault that the extended version of Speak Now has songs called both \u201cMine\u201d and \u201cOurs,\u201d and while \u201cOurs\u201d is good \u2026 well, it\u2019s no \u201cMine.\u201d Still, even if this song never rises above cuteness, it is incredibly cute. I think Dad\u2019ll get over the tattoos.\n\n65. \u201cThe Best Day,\u201d Fearless (2008): Swift\u2019s parents moved the family to Tennessee so she could follow her musical dreams, and she paid them back with this tender tribute. Mom gets the verses while Dad is relegated to the middle eight \u2014 even in song, the Mother\u2019s Day\u2013Father\u2019s Day disparity holds up.\n\n64. \u201cEverything Has Changed,\u201d Red (2012): \u201cWe good to go?\u201d For many American listeners, this was the first introduction to a redheaded crooner named Ed Sheeran. It\u2019s a sweet duet and Sheeran\u2019s got a roughness that goes well with Swift\u2019s cleaner vocals, but the harmonies are a bit bland.\n\n63. \u201cAfterglow,\u201d Lover (2019): If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say this one was a leftover from the Reputation sessions. (It\u2019s not; co-writers Louis Bell and Frank Dukes didn\u2019t work on that album.) Still, the airy vibe and heavy drums recall Swift\u2019s 2017 output with the fear and paranoia swapped out for honesty and accountability.\n\n62. \u201cCall It What You Want,\u201d Reputation (2017): Many of the Reputation singles aim at sexy; this airy slow jam about losing yourself in love after a scandal is the only one that gets there, though the saltiness in the verses (\u201call the liars are calling me one\u201d) occasionally betrays the sentiment.\n\n61. \u201cToday Was a Fairytale,\u201d Valentine\u2019s Day soundtrack (2010): How much of a roll was Swift on during the Fearless era? This song didn\u2019t make the album, and sat in the vault for a year until Swift signed on for a small role in a Garry Marshall rom-com and offered it up for the soundtrack. Despite the extravagant title, the date described here is charmingly low-key: The dude wears a T-shirt, and his grand gestures are showing up on time and being nice.\n\n60. \u201cLast Kiss,\u201d Speak Now (2010): A good-bye waltz with an understated arrangement that suits the starkness of the lyrics.\n\n59. \u201cYou Are in Love,\u201d 1989: Deluxe Edition (2014): The best of Swift\u2019s songs idealizing someone else\u2019s love story (see \u201cStarlight\u201d and \u201cMary\u2019s Song\u201d), this bonus track sketches Jack Antonoff and Lena Dunham\u2019s relationship in flashes of moments. The production and vocals are appropriately restrained \u2014 sometimes, simplicity works.\n\n58. \u201cMiss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince,\u201d Lover (2019): After years of being dinged for staying apolitical in her art, Swift here takes her first step into the arena, reframing the most recent presidential election through the high-school environment that provided so much of her early inspiration. It\u2019s an ambitious conceit that I don\u2019t think works 100 percent, but I appreciate how well the song evokes those pit-in-your-stomach days of late 2016. Knocked a few spots for featuring the cheerleader chorus on Lover that finally broke me.\n\n57. \u201cThe Story of Us,\u201d Speak Now (2010): The deluxe edition of Speak Now features both U.S. and international versions of some of the singles, which gives you a sense of how fine-tuned Swift\u2019s operation was by this point. My ears can\u2019t quite hear the difference between the two versions of this exuberant breakup jam, but I suspect the U.S. mix contains some sort of ultrasonic frequencies designed to \u2026 sorry, I\u2019ve already said too much.\n\n56. \u201cClean,\u201d 1989 (2014): Co-written with Imogen Heap, who contributes backup vocals. This is 1989\u2019s big end-of-album-catharsis song, and the water imagery of the lyrics goes well with the drip-drip-drip production. I\u2019d be curious to hear a version where Heap sings lead; the minimalist sound might be better suited for her voice, which has a little more texture.\n\n55. \u201cI Almost Do,\u201d Red (2012): The kind of plaintive breakup song Swift could write in her sleep at this point in her career, with standout guitar work and impressive vulnerability in both lyrics and performance.\n\n54. \u201cThe Man,\u201d Lover (2019): Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIf I Were a Boy\u201d transported to the world of media meta-narratives. It\u2019s funny in a way Swift rarely lets herself be in her work. And props for succinctness \u2014 the chorus sums up so much you barely even need the rest of the song. But it also feels a bit like a really good op-ed.\n\n53. \u201cLong Live (We Will Be Remembered),\u201d Speak Now (2010): Ostensibly written about Swift\u2019s experiences touring with her band, but universal enough that it\u2019s been taken as a graduation song by pretty much everyone else. Turns out, adolescent self-mythologizing is the same no matter where you are \u2014 no surprise that Swift could pull it off despite leaving school after sophomore year.\n\n52. \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things,\u201d Reputation (2017): Put aside the title, which can\u2019t help but remind me of the time Hillary Clinton tweeted \u201cdelete your account.\u201d The same way \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d is the best possible version of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d this is a much better rewrite of \u201cBad Blood.\u201d Swift brings back the school-yard voice in the chorus, but also so much more: She does exaggerated politeness in the bridge, she spins the \u201cRunaway\u201d toast, she says the words \u201cTherein lies the issue\u201d like she\u2019s been listening to Hamilton. The high point comes when she contemplates forgiving a hater, then bursts into an incredulous guffaw. Reader, I laughed out loud.\n\n51. \u201cThe Moment I Knew,\u201d Red: Deluxe Edition (2012): An epic account of being stood up that makes a terrible birthday party seem like something approximating the Fall of Troy. If you\u2019re the type of person who stays up at night remembering every inconsiderate thing you\u2019ve ever done, the level of excruciating detail here is like a needle to the heart.\n\n50. \u201cJump Then Fall,\u201d Fearless: Platinum Edition (2006): An effervescent banjo-driven love song. I get a silly kick out of the gag in the chorus, when Swift\u2019s voice leaps to the top of her register every time she says \u201cjump.\u201d\n\n49. \u201cNever Grow Up,\u201d Speak Now (2010): Swift\u2019s songs where she\u2019s romanticizing childhood come off better than the ones where she\u2019s romanticizing old age. (Possibly because she\u2019s been a child before.) This one is so well-observed and wistful about the idea of children aging that you\u2019d swear she was secretly a 39-year-old mom.\n\n48. \u201cPaper Rings,\u201d Lover (2019): Had Swift never moved to Nashville, this pop-punk confection sounds like something she might have released in the late aughts. I see a bright future for it as the hipster wedding\u2019s \u201cShake It Off\u201d \u2014 like the titular jewelry, this song is pleasantly handmade.\n\n47. \u201cShould\u2019ve Said No,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): Written in a rush of emotion near the end of recording for the debut, what this early single lacks in nuance it makes up for in backbone. I appreciate the way the end of each verse holds out hope for the cheating ex \u2014 \u201cgiven ooonnne chaaance, it was a moment of weeaaknesssss\u201d \u2014 before the chorus slams the door in the dumb lunk\u2019s face.\n\n46. \u201cBack to December,\u201d Speak Now (2010): At the time, this one was billed as a big step for Swift: the first song where she\u2019s the bad guy! Now that the novelty has worn off \u201cBack to December\u201d doesn\u2019t feel so groundbreaking, but it does show her evolving sensitivity. The key to a good apology has always been sincerity, and whatever faults Swift may have, a lack of sincerity has never been one of them.\n\n45. \u201cI Forgot That You Existed,\u201d Lover (2019): Probably too muted to be a first single, but man, imagine how different the buzz for Lover would have been had this winning song been our introduction to the era. As it is, it\u2019s a fitting leadoff track for the album proper, as Swift puts the Reputation drama behind her with a sprightly ode to the joy of indifference. In a fun twist, the utter lack of negative emotion here makes this one of Swift\u2019s coldest kiss-off songs. Elie Wiesel was right.\n\n44. \u201cI Did Something Bad,\u201d Reputation (2017): It\u2019s too bad Rihanna already has an album called Unapologetic, because that would have been a perfect title for Reputation, or maybe just this jubilant \u201cBlank Space\u201d sequel. Why the hell she didn\u2019t release this one instead of \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d I\u2019ll never know \u2014 not only does \u201cSomething Bad\u201d sell the lack of remorse much better, it bangs harder than any other song on pop radio that summer except \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d Is that a raga chant? Are those fucking gunshots? Docked a spot or ten for \u201cThey\u2019re burning all the witches even if you aren\u2019t one,\u201d which doth protest too much, but bumped up just as much for Swift\u2019s first on-the-record \u201cshit.\u201d\n\n43. \u201cHoly Ground,\u201d Red (2012): This chugging rocker nails the feeling of reconnecting with an ex and romanticizing the times you shared, and it livens up the back half of Red a bit. Probably ranked too high, but this is my list and I\u2019ll do what I want.\n\n42. \u201cDress,\u201d Reputation (2017): An appropriately slinky track that gives us an unexpected payoff for years of lyrics about party dresses: \u201cI only bought this dress so you could take it off,\u201d she says in the chorus. The way the whole song starts and stops is an obvious trick, but I like it.\n\n41. \u201cSoon You\u2019ll Get Better,\u201d Lover (2019): Swift brought out the Dixie Chicks for this soft acoustic ballad inspired by her mother\u2019s cancer recurrence. Despite the star-studded lineup, the song is simple, sincere, and affecting, and Swift\u2019s vocals infuse the heartbreaking details with just the right amount of childish vulnerability: \u201cYou\u2019ll get better soon / \u2019cause you have to.\u201d\n\n40. \u201cEnchanted,\u201d Speak Now (2010): Originally the title track for Swift\u2019s third album until her label told her, more or less, to cut it with the fairy-tale stuff. It\u2019s a glittery ode to a meet-cute that probably didn\u2019t need to be six minutes long, but at least the extended length gives us extra time to soak up the heavenly coda, with its multi-tracked \u201cPlease don\u2019t be in love in with someone else.\u201d\n\n39. \u201cI Know Places,\u201d 1989 (2014): No attempts of universality here \u2014 this trip-hop song about trying to find a place to make out when you\u2019re a massive celebrity is only relatable to a couple dozen people. No matter. As a slice of gothic pop-star paranoia, it gives a much-needed bit of edge to 1989. Bumped up a couple of spots for the line about vultures, which I can only assume is a shout-out.\n\n38. \u201cTreacherous,\u201d Red (2012): Swift has rarely been so tactile as on this intimate ballad, seemingly constructed entirely out of sighs.\n\n37. \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d Speak Now (2010): The rest of the band plays it so straight that it might take a second listen to realize that this song is, frankly, bonkers. First, Swift sneaks into a wedding to find a bridezilla, \u201cwearing a gown shaped like a pastry,\u201d snarling at the bridesmaids. Then it turns out she\u2019s been uninvited \u2014 oops \u2014 so she decides to hide in the curtains. Finally, at a pivotal moment she stands up in front of everyone and protests the impending union. Luckily the guy is cool with it, so we get a happy ending! All this nonsense undercuts the admittedly charming chorus, but it\u2019s hard not to smile at the unabashed silliness.\n\n36. \u201c22,\u201d Red (2012): Another collaboration with Martin and Shellback, another absurdly catchy single. Still, there\u2019s enough personality in the machine for this to still feel like a Taylor song, for better (\u201cbreakfast at midnight\u201d being the epitome of adult freedom) and for worse (the obsession with \u201ccool kids\u201d). Mostly for better.\n\n35. \u201cCruel Summer,\u201d Lover (2019): The Bananarama song comes from 1993, but this feels more 1989, with a big, sexy hook that ranks among Swift\u2019s strongest. (Compliments to Jack Antonoff, who co-produced, and St. Vincent, who co-wrote.) We\u2019re back in the realm of late-night hookups with dreamy bad boys, and there\u2019s a yearning here I really enjoy \u2014 not just the ache of falling for someone you weren\u2019t supposed to but also the nostalgia of someone in a settled relationship reminiscing about those uncertain early days. Try singing that \u201cgrinning like a devil\u201d line in the bridge without making a gnarly face, I dare you.\n\n34. \u201cChristmases When You Were Mine,\u201d The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection (2007): The clear standout of Swift\u2019s Christmas album, with an endearingly winsome riff and lyrics that paint a poignant picture of yuletide heartbreak. If you\u2019ve ever been alone on Christmas, this is your song.\n\n33. \u201cGetaway Car,\u201d Reputation (2017): Another very Jack Antonoff\u2013y track, but I\u2019m not mad at it. We start with a vocoder she must have stolen from Imogen Heap and end with one of Swift\u2019s most rocking outros, and in between we even get a rare key change and a \u201csoary\u201d that suggests the presence of at least one Canadian in the recording booth.\n\n32. \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d Fearless (2008): You\u2019d never call Swift a genre deconstructionist, but her best work digs deeper into romantic tropes than she gets credit for. In just her second album, she and Rose gave us this clear-eyed look at the emptiness of symbolic gestures, allegedly finished in a mere 45 minutes. Almost left off the album, but saved thanks to Shonda Rhimes.\n\n31. \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d Red (2012): The guiding principle on much of Red seems to have been to throw absolutely every idea a person could think of into a song and see what worked. Here, we go from Kelly Clarkson verses to a roller-coaster chorus to a dubstep breakdown that dates the song as surely as radiocarbon \u2014 then back again. It shouldn\u2019t hang together, but the adventurous vocals and vivid lyrics keep the track from going off the rails.\n\n30. \u201cCornelia Street,\u201d Lover (2019): Fans joke that Swift is the only person in the world who finds Joe Alwyn compelling, but against all odds this dreamy deep cut imbues the relationship with a sense of grandeur. She\u2019s looking back at their past, hoping her memories won\u2019t be poisoned by whatever comes next. It\u2019s as powerfully observed as all her best work \u2014 love makes nostalgists of us all.\n\n29. \u201cTeardrops on My Guitar,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): An evocative portrait of high-school heartbreak, equal parts mundane \u2014 no adult songwriter would have named the crush \u201cDrew\u201d \u2014 and melodramatic. It\u2019s also the best example of Swift and Rose\u2019s early songwriting cheat code, when they switch the words of the chorus around at the end of the song. \u201cIt just makes the listener feel like the writer and the artist care about the song,\u201d Rose told Billboard. \u201cThat they\u2019re like, \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve heard it, but wait a minute \u2014 \u2019cause I want you know that this really affected me, I\u2019m gonna dig the knife in just a little bit deeper.\u2019\u201d (In a fitting twist, \u201cTeardrops\u201d ended up inspiring a moment that could have come straight out of a Taylor Swift song, when the real Drew showed up outside her house one night. \u201cI hadn\u2019t talked to him in two-and-a-half years,\u201d she told the Washington Post. \u201cHe was like: \u2018Hey, how\u2019s it going?\u2019 And I\u2019m like: \u2018Wow, you\u2019re late? Good to see you?\u2019\u201d)\n\n28. \u201cBegin Again,\u201d Red (2012): Swift\u2019s sequencing genius strikes again: After the emotional roller coaster of Red, this gentle ballad plays like a cleansing shower. (It works so well she\u2019d repeat the trick on 1989, Reputation, and Lover.) Of all Swift\u2019s date songs, this one feels the most true to life; anyone who\u2019s ever been on a good first date can recall the precise moment their nervousness melted into relief.\n\n27. \u201cLover,\u201d Lover (2019): She\u2019s gone alt-country. The title track from Swift\u2019s seventh album turned out to be a self-consciously muted ballad about slowing down and settling down into an adult relationship. With a vibe like that, who better to evoke than the patron saint of weary 30-somethings, Jenny Lewis? It\u2019s trodding ground she\u2019d already covered in \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d but by this point in Swift\u2019s career, I\u2019d much rather hear her mine this vein than release an umpteenth singsongy single. The closing wedding waltz veers a little off track for me, but it\u2019s rescued somewhat by an energetic performance.\n\n26. \u201cShake It Off,\u201d 1989 (2014): Swift\u2019s second No. 1 was greeted with widespread critical sighs: After the heights of Red, why was she serving up cotton-candy fluff about dancing your way past the haters? (Never mind that Red had its own sugary singles.) Now that we\u2019ve all gotten some distance, the purpose of \u201cShake It Off\u201d is clear: This is a wedding song, empty-headed fun designed to get both Grandma and Lil Jayden on the dance floor. Docked ten or so spots for the spoken-word bridge and cheerleader breakdown, which might be the worst 24 seconds of the entire album.\n\n25. \u201cDelicate,\u201d Reputation (2017): With multitracked, breathy vocals, this is Swift at her most tentative. Would any other album\u2019s Taylor be asking, \u201cIs it cool that I said all that?\u201d On an album where Swift attempted to play the villain without much success, the vulnerability plays better: This is the most genuinely sexy song on Reputation.\n\n24. \u201cSafe and Sound,\u201d The Hunger Games: Songs From District 12 and Beyond (2012): Swift\u2019s collaboration with folk duo the Civil Wars is her best soundtrack cut by a country mile. Freed from the constraints of her usual mode, her vocals paint in corners you didn\u2019t think she could reach, especially when she tries out a high-pitched vibrato that blends beautifully with Joy Williams and John Paul White\u2019s hushed harmonies. Swift has worked in a variety of emotional palettes in her career, but this is the only time she\u2019s ever been spooky.\n\n23. \u201cPicture to Burn,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): Swift\u2019s breakup songs rarely get more acidic than they do in this country hit. By the time she\u2019s twanging a line about dating all her ex\u2019s friends, things have gotten downright rowdy. The original lyrics \u2014 \u201cGo and tell your friends that I\u2019m obsessive and crazy / That\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll tell mine you\u2019re gay\u201d \u2014 show how far standards for acceptable speech in nice young people have shifted in the past decade.\n\n22. \u201cThe Archer,\u201d Lover (2019): By 2019, Swift\u2019s pattern with promotional releases was well-established: The first few singles are infectious bubblegum stuff, and not until those have become annoyingly inescapable do we get to hear the slower, more emotional material. As with \u201cGorgeous,\u201d it\u2019s tempting to grade \u201cArcher\u201d on a curve based on what came before, but I suspect this one will hold up. Jack Antonoff\u2019s production now sounds as nostalgic for 2014 as it does for 1989, but it never overwhelms the intriguing vulnerability of Swift\u2019s lyrics. The line \u201cI never grew up, it\u2019s getting so old\u201d is possibly the most self-aware lyric in the artist\u2019s discography.\n\n21. \u201cFearless,\u201d Fearless (2008): The title track from Swift\u2019s second album has more of her favorite images \u2014 in one memorable twofer, she\u2019s dancing in the rain while wearing her best dress \u2014 but she invests them with so much emotion that you\u2019d swear she was using them for the first time. The exuberance of the lyrics is matched in the way she tumbles from line to line into the chorus.\n\n20. \u201cTim McGraw,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): If you by chance ever happen to meet Taylor Swift, there is one thing you should know: Do not, under any circumstances, call her \u201ccalculating.\u201d \u201cAm I shooting from the hip?\u201d she once asked GQ when confronted with the word. \u201cWould any of this have happened if I was? \u2026 You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.\u201d However, since the title of her first single apparently came from label head Scott Borchetta \u2014 \u201cI told Taylor, \u2018They won\u2019t immediately remember your name, they\u2019ll say who\u2019s this young girl with this song about Tim McGraw?\u2019\u201d \u2014 I think we\u2019re allowed to break out the c-word: Calling it \u201cTim McGraw\u201d was the first genius calculation in a career that would turn out to be full of them. Still, there would have been no getting anywhere with it if the song weren\u2019t good. Even as a teenager, Swift was savvy enough to know that country fans love nothing more than listening to songs about listening to country music. And the very first line marks her as more of a skeptic than you might expect: \u201cHe said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia pines to shame that night / I said, \u2018That\u2019s a lie.\u2019\u201d\n\n19. \u201cDear John,\u201d Speak Now (2010): \u201cI\u2019ve never named names,\u201d Swift once told GQ. \u201cThe fact that I\u2019ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I\u2019m holding.\u201d That may technically be true, but she came pretty dang close with this seven-minute epic. (John Mayer said he felt \u201chumiliated\u201d by the song, after which Swift told Glamour it was \u201cpresumptuous\u201d of him to think that the song his ex wrote, that used his first name, was about him.) She sings the hell out of it, but when it comes to songs where Swift systematically outlines all the ways in which an older male celebrity is an inadequate partner, I think I prefer \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d which is less wallow-y. I\u2019ve seen it speculated that the guitar noodling on this track is meant as a parody of Mayer\u2019s own late-\u201900s output, which if true would be deliciously petty.\n\n18. \u201cRed,\u201d Red (2012): Re-eh-eh-ed, re-eh-eh-ed. Red\u2019s title track sees the album\u2019s maximalist style in full effect \u2014 who in their right mind would put Auto-Tune and banjos on the same track? But somehow, the overstuffing works here; it\u2019s the audio equivalent of the lyrics\u2019 synesthesia.\n\n17. \u201cForever & Always,\u201d Fearless (2008): This blistering breakup song was the one that solidified Swift\u2019s image as the pop star you dump at your own peril. (The boys in the debut were just Nashville randos; this one was about a Jonas Brother, back when that really meant something.) Obligatory fiddles aside, the original version is just about a perfect piece of pop-rock \u2014 dig how the guitars drop out at a pivotal moment \u2014 though the extended edition of Fearless also contains a piano version if you feel like having your guts ripped out. I have no idea what the lines about \u201crain in your bedroom\u201d mean, but like the best lyrics, they make sense on an instinctual level. And to top it off, the track marks the introduction of Swift\u2019s colloquial style \u2014 \u201cWhere is this GOoO-ING?\u201d \u2014 that would serve her so well in the years to come.\n\n16. \u201cMean,\u201d Speak Now (2010): It takes some chutzpah to put a song complaining about mean people on the same album as \u201cBetter Than Revenge,\u201d but lack of chutzpah has never been Swift\u2019s problem. Get past that and you\u2019ll find one of Swift\u2019s most naturally appealing melodies and the joyful catharsis that comes with giving a bully what\u2019s coming to them. (Some listeners have interpreted the \u201cbig enough so you can\u2019t hit me\u201d line to mean the song\u2019s about abuse, but I\u2019ve always read it as a figure of speech, as in \u201chit piece.\u201d)\n\n15. \u201cStyle,\u201d 1989 (2014): The much-ballyhooed \u201980s sound on 1989 often turned out to just mean Swift was using more synths than usual, but she nailed the vibe on this slinky single, which could have soundtracked a particularly romantic episode of Miami Vice. Despite the dress-up games in the chorus, this is one of the rare Swift love songs to feel truly adult: Both she and the guy have been down this road too many times to bullshit anymore. That road imagery is haunted by the prospect of death lurking around every hairpin turn \u2014 what\u2019s sex without a little danger?\n\n14. \u201cHey Stephen,\u201d Fearless (2008): Who knew so many words rhymed with Stephen? They all come so naturally here. Swift is in the zone as a writer, performer, and producer on this winning deep cut, which gives us some wonderful sideways rhymes (\u201clook like an angel\u201d goes with \u201ckiss you in the rain, so\u201d), a trusty Hammond organ in the background, and a bunch of endearing little ad-libs, to say nothing of the kicker: \u201cAll those other girls, well they\u2019re beautiful / But would they write a song for you?\u201d For once, the mid-song laugh is entirely appropriate.\n\n13. \u201cOut of the Woods,\u201d 1989 (2014): Like Max Martin, Jack Antonoff\u2019s influence as a collaborator has not been wholly positive: His penchant for big anthemic sounds can drown out the subtlety of Swift, and he\u2019s been at the controls for some of her biggest misfires. But boy, does his Antonoff thing work here, bringing a whole forest of drums to support Swift\u2019s rapid-fire string of memories. The song\u2019s bridge was apparently inspired by a snowmobile accident Swift was in with Harry Styles, an incident that never made the tabloids despite what seemed like round-the-clock coverage of the couple \u2014 a subtler reminder of the limits of media narratives than anything on Reputation.\n\n12. \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day,\u201d Reputation (2017): Like a prestige cable drama, Swift likes to use her final track as a kind of quiet summing-up of all that\u2019s come before. Here, she saves the album\u2019s most convincing love song for last: \u201cI want your midnights / but I\u2019ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year\u2019s Day\u201d is a great way to describe a healthy relationship. The lovely back-and-forth vocals in the outro help boost this past the similar \u201cBegin Again.\u201d\n\n11. \u201cWildest Dreams,\u201d 1989 (2014): Swift is in full control of her instrument here, with so much yearning in her voice that you\u2019d swear every breath was about to be her last. For a singer often slammed as being sexless, those sighs in the chorus tell us everything we need to know. Bumped up a few spots for the invigorating double-time bridge, the best on 1989.\n\n10. \u201cLove Story,\u201d Fearless (2008): Full disclosure: This was the first Taylor Swift song I ever heard. (It was a freezing day in early 2009; I was buying shoes; basically, the situation was the total antithesis of anything that\u2019s ever happened in a Taylor Swift song.) I didn\u2019t like it at first. Who\u2019s this girl singing about Romeo and Juliet, and doesn\u2019t she know they die in the end? What I would soon learn was: not here they don\u2019t, as Swift employs a key change so powerful it literally rewrites Shakespeare. The jury\u2019s still out on the question of if she\u2019s ever read the play, but she definitely hasn\u2019t read The Scarlet Letter.\n\n9. \u201cState of Grace,\u201d Red (2012): Swift\u2019s songs are always full of interesting little nuggets you don\u2019t notice until your 11th listen or so \u2014 a lyrical twist, maybe, or an unconventional drum fill \u2014 but most of them are fundamentally meant to be heard on the radio, which demands a certain type of songwriting and a certain type of sound. What a surprise it was, then, that Red opened with this big, expansive rock track, which sent dozens of Joshua Tree fans searching for their nearest pair of headphones. Another surprise: that she never tried to sound like this again. Having proven she could nail it on her first try, Swift set out to find other giants to slay.\n\n8. \u201cRonan,\u201d non-album digital single (2012): A collage of lines pulled from the blog of Maya Thompson, whose 3-year-old son had died of cancer, this charity single sees Swift turn herself into an effective conduit for the other woman\u2019s grief. (Thompson gets a co-writing credit.) One of the most empathetic songs in Swift\u2019s catalogue, as well as her most reliable tearjerker.\n\n7. \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d Red (2012): Flash back to 2012. Carly Rae Jepsen had a No. 1 hit. Freaking Gotye had a No. 1 hit. LMFAO had two. And yet Swift, arguably the biggest pop star in the country, had never had a No. 1 hit. (\u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d and \u201cToday Was a Fairytale\u201d had both peaked at No. 2.) And so she called up Swedish pop cyborg Max Martin, the man who makes hits as regularly as you and I forget our car keys. The first song they wrote together is still their masterpiece, though it feels wrong to say that \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d was written; better to say that it was designed, as Swift and Martin turn almost every single second of the song\u2019s 3:12 run time into a hook. Think of that guitar loop, the snippets of millennial-speak in the margins (\u201ccuz like\u201d), those spiraling \u201cooh\u201ds, the spoken-word bit that could have been overheard at any brunch in America, and towering over it all, that gigantic \u201cwe.\u201d Like all hyper-efficient products it feels like a visitor from some cold algorithmic future: The sense of joy here is so perfectly engineered that you get the sense it did not come entirely from human hands.\n\n6. \u201cOur Song,\u201d Taylor Swift (2006): Swift wrote this one for her ninth-grade talent show, and I have a lovely time imagining all the other competitors getting the disappointment of their lives once they realized what they were up against. (\u201cBut nice job with that Green Day cover, Andy.\u201d) Even at this early stage Swift had a knack for matching her biggest melodic hooks to sentences that would make them soar; that \u201c\u2019cause it\u2019s late and your mama don\u2019t know\u201d is absolutely ecstatic. She\u2019s said she heard the entire production in her head while writing, and on the record Nathan Chapman brings out all the tricks in the Nashville handbook, and even some that aren\u2019t, like the compressed hip-hop drums in the final refrain.\n\n5. \u201cMine,\u201d Speak Now (2010): As catchy as her Max Martin songs, but with more of a soul, \u201cMine\u201d wins a narrow victory over \u201cOur Song\u201d on account of having a better bridge. This one\u2019s another fantasy, and you can kind of tell, but who cares \u2014 Paul McCartney didn\u2019t really fall in love with a meter maid, either. Swift packs in so many captivating turns of phrase here, and she does it so naturally: It\u2019s hard to believe no one else got to \u201cyou are the best thing that\u2019s ever been mine\u201d before her, and the line about \u201ca careless man\u2019s careful daughter\u201d is so perfect that you instantly know everything about the guy. Let\u2019s give a special shout-out to Nathan Chapman again: His backup vocals are the secret weapon of Speak Now, and they\u2019re at their very best here.\n\n4. \u201cBlank Space,\u201d 1989 (2014): You know how almost every other song that\u2019s even a little bit like \u201cBlank Space\u201d ranks very low on this list? Yeah, that\u2019s how hard a trick Swift pulls off on this 1989 single, which manages to satirize her man-eater image while also demonstrating exactly what makes that image so appealing. The gag takes a perfectly tuned barometer for tone: \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d collapsed under the weight of its own self-obsession; \u201cBetter Than Revenge\u201d didn\u2019t quite get the right amount of humor in. But Swift\u2019s long history of code-switching works wonders for her here, as she gives each line just the right spin \u2014 enough irony for us to get the jokes, enough sincerity that we\u2019ll all sing along anyway. Martin and Shellback bring their usual bells and whistles, but they leave enough empty space in the mix for the words to ring out. Who wouldn\u2019t want to write their name?\n\n3. \u201cFifteen,\u201d Fearless (2008): For many young people, the real experience of romance is the thinking about it, not the actual doing it. (For an increasing number, the thinking about it is all they\u2019re doing.) Swift gets this almost instinctively, and never more than on this early ballad about her freshman year of high school, which plays like a gentle memoir. Listen to how the emotional high point of the second verse is not something that happens, but her reaction to it: \u201cHe\u2019s got a car and you feel like flyyying.\u201d She knows that the real thing is awkward, occasionally unpleasant, and almost guaranteed to disappoint you \u2014 the first sentence she wrote for this one was \u201cAbigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind / We both cried,\u201d a line that became exhibit B in the case of Taylor Swift v. Feminism \u2014 and she knows how fantasies can sustain you when nothing else will. \u201cIn your life you\u2019ll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team / but I didn\u2019t know it at 15,\u201d she sings, even though she\u2019s only 18 herself. That there are plenty of people who spent their teenage years making out, smoking cigarettes, and reading Ana\u00efs Nindoesn\u2019t negate the fact that, for a lot of us squares, even the prospect of holding someone else\u2019s hand could get us through an entire semester. Virgins need love songs, too.\n\n2. \u201cAll Too Well,\u201d Red (2012): It\u2019s no wonder that music writers love this one: This is Swift at her most literary, with a string of impeccably observed details that could have come out of a New Yorker short story. \u201cAll Too Well\u201d was the first song Swift wrote for Red; she hadn\u2019t worked with Liz Rose since Fearless, but she called up her old collaborator to help her make sense of her jumble of memories from a relationship recently exploded. \u201cShe had a story and she wanted to say something specific. She had a lot of information,\u201d Rose told Rolling Stone later. \u201cI just let her go.\u201d The original version featured something like eight verses; together the two women edited it down to a more manageable three, while still retaining its propulsive momentum. The finished song is a kaleidoscopic swirl of images \u2014 baby pictures at his parents\u2019 house, \u201cnights where you made me your own,\u201d a scarf left in a drawer \u2014 always coming back to the insistence that these things happened, and they mattered: \u201cI was there, I remember it all too well.\u201d The words are so strong that the band mostly plays support; they don\u2019t need anything flashier than a 4/4 thump and a big crescendo for each chorus. There are few moments on Red better than the one where Swift jumps into her upper register to deliver the knockout blow in the bridge. Just like the scarf, you can\u2019t get rid of this song.\n\n1. \u201cYou Belong With Me,\u201d Fearless (2008): Swift was hanging out with a male friend one day when he took a call from his girlfriend. \u201cHe was completely on the defensive saying, \u2018No, baby \u2026 I had to get off the phone really quickly \u2026 I tried to call you right back \u2026 Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cShe was just yelling at him! I felt so bad for him at that moment.\u201d Out of that feeling, a classic was born. Swift had written great songs drawn from life before, but here she gave us a story of high school at its most archetypal: A sensitive underdog facing off with some prissy hot chick, in a battle to see which one of them really got a cute boy\u2019s jokes. (Swift would play both women in the video; she had enough self-awareness to know that most outcasts are not tall, willowy blonde girls.) Rose says the song \u201cjust flowed out of\u201d Swift, and you can feel that rush of inspiration in the way the lines bleed into each other, but there\u2019s some subtle songcraft at work, too: Besides the lyrical switcheroos about who wears what, we also only get half the chorus the first go-round, just to save one more wallop for later. The line about short skirts and T-shirts will likely be mentioned in Swift\u2019s obituary one day, and I think it\u2019s key to the song\u2019s, and by extension Swift\u2019s, appeal: In my high school, even the most popular kids wore T-shirts.", "description": "Ranking every song by Taylor Swift, including everything from her greatest hits to her latest album, \u201cLover.\u201d", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/11/09/09-taylor-swift-ranking-feature.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
