But outside of a handful of counties in Nevada, it\u2019s illegal in the U.S. A movement is now gaining traction to decriminalize sex work.\n\nThe City Council in Washington, D.C., and the New York state Legislature are considering separate decriminalization bills. Under decriminalization, selling and buying sex would still be illegal but would carry no criminal penaties. Several Democratic candidates for president \u2014 including Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker \u2014 have said they would consider decriminalizing sex work nationwide.\n\nLaws concerning prostitution vary widely between countries, with some banning it entirely and others treating it as a completely legal industry. Some places, including Canada, use what\u2019s known as the Nordic model, in which selling sex is allowed but buying it is still prohibited.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThe decriminalization push has largely been led by sex workers themselves, who say current laws make them vulnerable to violence and harassment while doing nothing to curb the demand for buying sex. Decriminalizing prostitution, they say, would create a legitimate marketplace that would put nefarious actors like pimps and traffickers out of business. Others make the case that sex work is a legitimate profession that should be afforded the rights and protections given to all other jobs.\n\nDecriminalization advocates say it\u2019s better than making prostitution legal, because they believe legalization would create space for a black market outside the law that would be fertile ground for trafficking and other forms of exploitation.\n\nOpposition to decriminalization comes from a number of directions. There are, of course, those who believe that selling sex is immoral and shouldn\u2019t be permitted. Others who support sex workers\u2019 rights say decriminalization would make trafficking and exploitation worse by increasing demand in the sex trade. Some sex workers prefer the Nordic model or full legalization to the decriminalization bills currently under consideration.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the decriminalization bills in either New York or D.C. will have the votes to be passed, even with left-leaning legislative bodies in both places. If Washington\u2019s City Council approves a bill, it will then have to survive a review from Congress before it can become law.\n\nPerspectives:\n\nSupporters\n\nCriminalized sex work creates risk for people from marginalized communities\n\n\u201cVice enforcement increases police contact with LGBTQ people, and can expose them to violence by increasing stigma against them.\u201d \u2014 Melissa Gira Grant, New Republic\n\nConsenting adults should be able to exchange sex for money\n\n\u201cCriminalizing adult, voluntary, and consensual sex \u2014 including the commercial exchange of sexual services \u2014 is incompatible with the human right to personal autonomy and privacy.\u201d \u2014 Human Rights Watch\n\nDecriminalizing sex work would decrease trafficking\n\n\u201cDecriminalization of sex work makes everyone safer. More than any other kind of system, decriminalization will help reduce the number of people who are trafficked and help those who are victims of trafficking get to safety more easily with fewer negative health and safety consequences.\u201d \u2014 Katie Tastrom, Rewire\n\nSex work provides opportunity for people with limited options\n\n\u201cThroughout history, people have exchanged the commodity of sex for money to survive against poverty, to empower themselves against miserable life circumstances, and to challenge societal norms.\u201d \u2014 Alex Corona, USA Today\n\nBanning sex work is a violation of individual liberty\n\n\u201cDecriminalizing sex work is an opportunity to restore freedom and autonomy over our bodies. Supporting choice, freedom, and liberty is what this country is supposed to be about, and not allowing government to find and utilize more ways to control our individual bodies that interfere with our rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d \u2014 Tamika Spellman, The Root\n\nSex workers deserve rights afforded to people in any other profession\n\n\u201cJustice won\u2019t be found in locking up sex workers, ending demand for commercial sex, or \u2018exiting\u2019 sex workers into low-wage jobs in sweat shops.
