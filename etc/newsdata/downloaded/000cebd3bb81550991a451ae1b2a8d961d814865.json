The call came a month before Trump put a hold on $250 million in military aid to Ukraine -- a hold that was eventually released after objections from the Senate.\n\nJoe Biden, now a Democratic presidential candidate, has faced scrutiny for months over his past role pressuring the country to fire its top prosecutor while he was leading a corruption investigation into a natural gas company that had ties to Hunter. Giuliani has suggested that Biden, as VP, worked to protect the company from investigation.\n\nIn a lengthy statement Friday evening, Biden said that if the reports were true \"there is truly no bottom to President Trump\u2019s willingness to abuse his power and abase our country.\n\n\"This behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,\" Biden continued. \"It means that he used the power and resources of the United States to pressure a sovereign nation\u2014a partner that is still under direct assault from Russia\u2014pushing Ukraine to subvert the rule of law in the express hope of extracting a political favor ...\"\n\n\"At minimum,\" Biden concluded, \"Donald Trump should immediately release the transcript of the call in question, so that the American people can judge for themselves, and direct the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to stop stonewalling and release the whistleblower notification to the Congress.\"\n\nWhat initially touched off the controversy is a secret whistleblower complaint that the director of national intelligence has kept from Congress, reportedly involving a \"promise\" Trump made to an unnamed foreign leader. In the latest development, The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the complaint relates to Ukraine. Fox News has not confirmed the reports.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT, REPORTEDLY ON TRUMP 'PROMISE' TO FOREIGN LEADER, TOUCHES OFF DC FIRESTORM\n\nTrump called that initial story \u201cridiculous\u201d in the Oval Office, and said he doesn\u2019t know the identity of the whistleblower. He wouldn\u2019t say what was discussed in the call but said someone should \u201clook into\u201d Biden family connections to Ukraine.\n\n\"I have conversations with many leaders. It's always appropriate. Always appropriate,\" Trump said. \"At the highest level, always appropriate. And anything I do, I fight for this country.\"\n\nAfterward, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and other Democratic committee leaders issued a statement demanding the administration hand over the complaint, after acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire would not share details of it with lawmakers.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump just went on national television\u2014from the Oval Office\u2014and personally attacked an Intelligence Community whistleblower who reported an urgent matter involving serious or flagrant misconduct,\" the statement said, adding that the \"brazen effort to intimidate this whistleblower risks a chilling effect on future whistleblowers.\"\n\nAfter the publication of the Journal\u2019s story, 2020 Democrats quickly weighed in. Former Housing Secretary Julian Castro said that Trump \u201cis a criminal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe must be impeached immediately,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said that Trump \u201cappears to be collaborating with foreign governments to attack America\u2019s democracy\u201d before she urged the whistleblower to come forward.\n\n\u201cI would absolutely urge this whistleblower to go directly to Congress, whether in closed session or in open session,\u201d she said.\n\nSchiff told reporters Friday that the whistleblower claim \"deserves a thorough investigation.\"\n\n\"Come hell or high water, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said. Democrats have been looking into whether Giuliani traveled to Ukraine to pressure the government to investigate the Biden activities, and have also sought a transcript of the July call between Trump and Zelensky.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe inspector general for the intelligence community received the whistleblower complaint and, according to correspondence with Schiff, considered the allegations \u201ccredible\u201d and dealing with an \u201curgent concern.\u201d Inspector General Michael Atkinson wrote that the DNI, \u201cafter consulting with the Department of Justice,\u201d determined the complaint does not have to be shared with the intelligence committees under law. He wrote that he will \u201cabide by that determination,\u201d but disagrees with it.\n\nIn a letter Tuesday, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Jason Klitenic, wrote that the agency is protecting the whistleblower and argued the allegation does not meet the definition of \"urgent concern.\" He said the complaint \"concerned conduct from someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to `intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision.\"\n\nMaguire is expected to testify publicly about the whistleblower complaint on Sept. 26. after being subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee. Schiff had accused Maguire of withholding a whistleblower complaint from Congress and questioned whether he had been directed to do so by the White House or the attorney general.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas, Hillary Vaughn, Andrew Craft and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "The controversy over President Trump\u2019s mysterious call with a foreign leader that prompted a whistleblower complaint ratcheted up Friday afternoon as a new report said it involved Trump asking Ukraine numerous times in a single phone call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son.", "authors": ["Adam Shaw"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/20/694940094001_6088171351001_6088169681001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
