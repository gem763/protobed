After Thanksgiving, things start to shut down in a way and the sun sets sooner.\u201d\n\nThe sun has already set on a few campaigns and odds are that the path to the nomination will be strewn with more casualties by Thanksgiving.\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden remains the consensus front-runner, having sat atop most national and early primary state polls since entering the race in late April.\n\nThe 76-year-old, though, has struggled to shake the idea that his support is fragile and could crumble after a pair of lackluster debate performances and a series of verbal miscues that have reinforced his reputation as the king of gaffes.\n\n\u201cThe level of scrutiny of Biden is not going to change,\u201d said Dante J. Scala, a professor of political science at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cThat said, Biden is the only one in the race right now who actually has a working coalition that could deliver him the nomination.\n\n\u201cBy that I mean African American voters, plus white moderate or blue-collar Democrats,\u201d Mr. Scala said. \u201cSo for all the gaffes and stumbles and so forth, he is still in a place where the others need to get to.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s closest rivals, according to polls and fundraising reports, are Sens. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Kamala D. Harris of California, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThat foursome will have the coming months to prove they can expand their bases of support and build winning coalitions in the early primary states.\n\n\u201cFor Warren it is, \u2018OK, white progressives like me, they really like me. But that is probably not enough to get me the nomination. So how do I build beyond that?\u2019\u201d Mr. Scala said.\n\nMr. Biden, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Ms. Harris and Mr. Buttigieg will headline the Sept. 12 debate in Houston.\n\nThe one-night event also will feature entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nThe clock is ticking on these five candidates to make their mark on voters and donors, which will ultimately help determine whether they can air TV and radio ads and seriously compete in each of the early primary states.\n\nMeanwhile, those who failed to make the debate \u2014 including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 are now long shots.\n\n\u201cIf you are not on that debate stage, you quickly start to become a memory in the eyes and ears of voters,\u201d said Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics and Chief of Staff at St. Anselm College. \u201cThat is a difficult position, and that is by design. The DNC wants to have the focus on those who could be a contender, not who is looking to sell a bestselling book.\u201d\n\nThe candidates who missed the cut for the debate but are staying in the race will have an opportunity make an impression this week at the New Hampshire Democratic Party State Convention and, after the debate, at the Polk County Steak Fry in Iowa on Sept. 21.\n\n\u201cThe steak fry offers a rare opportunity for thousands of people to see and meet the 2020 candidates at a much more affordable price than many of the events,\u201d said Sean Bagniewski, chair of the Polk County Democrats. \u201cWe\u2019ve already sold 7,500 tickets to 35 states.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the candidates, it\u2019s a unique opportunity to speak to a national audience and to sway one of the largest crowds of Iowa caucus voters,\u201d he said.\n\nPolitical insiders, meanwhile, have been left to ponder who will be able to avoid the fate of Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the race once it became clear they failed to qualify for the third debate.\n\nMr. Smith said in Iowa that the winnowing \u201cis going to release some tension among voters and caucusgoers who say, \u2018OK, that is one person we can check off our list; we don\u2019t have to worry about them anymore.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt is nice to clear the field a tad,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
