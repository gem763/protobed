While this is something Democrats are contemplating, Tlaib said this is \"uncharted territory.\"\n\n\u201cIf they were to detain someone, where would they go and have them detained so that they can comply with the subpoenas?\u201d Tlaib said.\n\n\u201cThere have been actual serious conversations about what the logistics would look like . . . if we did have to force someone through a court order to come before the Congressional committee,\" she explained. \"This is pretty uncharted territory for many of us and even for Congress.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump took to Twitter to voice his thoughts on Tlaib's comments:\n\nA despicable human being! https://t.co/3KpgUuRaXU \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 13, 2019\n\nEarlier this month, at a town hall meeting, about the \"unprecedented\" stop Democrats are making.\n\nLet me tell you, this is pretty \u2014 and this is the last caucus conversation we had.

So they're trying to figure out \u2014 no joke \u2014 they're trying to figure out, \"Well, is it the D.C. police that goes and gets them?\" No, no. What are we hoping? I mean, I'm not in those kinds of conversations, but I'm asking, like, you know, what happens? And they're like, \"Well, Rashida, we're trying to figure it out ourselves because this is uncharted territory.\" No, I'm telling you that they're trying to be like, \"Well, where are we going to put them? Where are we going to hold them?\" No, I mean those are the kinds of things they're trying to tread carefully.\n\nDemocrats have moved forward with a formal impeachment inquiry, which started when a whistleblower filed a complaint over a call President Donald Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. During the call, Trump suggested Zelensky investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for corruption. While Biden was overseeing affairs with Ukraine, Hunter was being paid $50,000 a month by a Ukrainian gas company despite having no natural energy experience.", "description": "Here we go..10/13/2019 19:33:27PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/228/3e42302a-f01f-4b97-a2d8-4303eec01946.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
