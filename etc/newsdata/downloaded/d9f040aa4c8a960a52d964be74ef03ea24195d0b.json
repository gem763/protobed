Boxing is a bizarre world but I know for a fact that Joseph is not well. He has been ordered to rest for three weeks so he can\u2019t make October 26, unfortunately,\u201d Higgins said.\n\n\u201cJoe is keen to get back in as soon as possible. Hopefully we will have some good news soon.\u201d\n\nNevada is notorious for Black Widow spiders. Parker last fought in June when he stopped former world title challenger Alex Leapai in ten rounds in America on his debut on the sports streaming platform DAZN.\n\nParker's only career defeats came in 2018 when he lost via unanimous decision to both Anthony Joshua, for his WBO crown, and then Dillian Whyte late in the year.", "description": "Joseph Parker has blamed a mysterious spider bite in training camp in Las Vegas for withdrawing from his fight against Dereck Chisora in London on October 26.", "authors": ["Gareth A Davies", "Boxing Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/boxing/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000211771830-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwRMWbYwzrg_3PLcMwCu9G8U.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
