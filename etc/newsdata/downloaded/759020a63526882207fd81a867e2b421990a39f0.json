Photo: Getty Images\n\nCelebrity drama is not unlike a game of chess. Move after move, interview after interview, tensions between the two impossibly rich game pieces rise until someone gets toppled over. With Taylor Swift dedicating her 2020 to rerecording her masters (check), Scooter Braun is making one of his last remaining moves. And it\u2019s a play straight out of Swift\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when you get attacked and it\u2019s not based on any truth, but for that other person it may be based in truth but they don\u2019t have all the information,\u201d Braun said on the Wide Open podcast Thursday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I am always open to communication and having a conversation with someone and saying, \u2018Maybe this was a misunderstanding and I am happy to have the conversation with you.\u2019 But not everybody is willing to do that and you can\u2019t go through life thinking you\u2019re going to be friends and everyone is going to like you.\u201d Sound familiar? It\u2019s more or less the same explanation Taylor Swift gave to Rolling Stone about the dissolution of her friendship with Kanye West.\n\n\u201cSome events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch. That was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I,\u201d she said, adding later: \u201cAnd then when I heard the song, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let\u2019s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.\u2019\u201d They both play the scorned victim, but for Scooter, it\u2019s a little late. What else can you do when trying to beat Taylor Swift at her own game? Maybe next, Scooter will record a revenge album with a recurring snake motif. Or he\u2019ll just tip over his king and let the girl rerecord her masters in peace.", "description": "Talent manager Scooter Braun opens up about his feud with Taylor Swift since buying her masters from Big Machine Label Group.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/27/27-scooter-braun-taylor-swift.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
