The centre-left Social Democratic party (SP\u00d6) plummeted to a historically low 21.7% but was still the second-biggest party.\n\nThe FP\u00d6 \u2013 whose former leader Heinz-Christian Strache resigned in May after a covertly filmed video showed the then vice-chancellor offering lucrative public contracts in exchange for campaign support to a woman he believed to be the niece of a Russian oligarch \u2013 came third with 16.1%, a drop of about 10 percentage points.\n\nSince June, Austria has been led by a caretaker government headed by the constitutional lawyer Brigitte Bierlein, after Kurz became the first chancellor in the country\u2019s modern history to be removed from office by a no-confidence vote.\n\nBut the result on Sunday shows Kurz, who became foreign minister aged 27 and has reshaped the \u00d6VP in his image since he took over the party\u2019s leadership in 2017, has emerged largely unscathed from what is known as the \u201cIbiza scandal\u201d.\n\nThe Green party, which in 2017 failed to get over the 4% threshold for the first time since 1983, gained 10.2 percentage points to re-enter parliament, fuelling speculation Kurz could invite it to form a government, possibly in a three-way alliance with the pro-business, liberal NEOS party, which took 7.8%.\n\nWhile Green supporters frantically celebrated the result, a coalition with the \u00d6VP is only backed by a third of its members.\n\nWith Strache banished from office and the FP\u00d6 under new leadership, a renewed alliance between the conservatives and the far right was considered the most likely outcome \u2013 until Sunday evening, when the party performed considerably worse than expected. On Austrian television, its general secretary, Harald Vilimsky, said FP\u00d6 had \u201cno mandate\u201d to enter another coalition with Kurz.\n\nThe party, which is led by the hardline former interior minister Herbert Kickl and the 2016 presidential candidate Norbert Hofer, has openly rallied for a reunion with the \u00d6VP. Its campaign video shows Hofer readjusting a portrait of the 33-year-old former chancellor to stop it \u201ctilting to the left\u201d.\n\nFor Kurz, a renewed pact with a diminished far right would likely tilt the balance of power in his favour. Before the election on Sunday, he appeared to have already ruled out handing another post to Kickl.\n\nKurz also knows he can contain the aggressive style of rightwing populists more easily by keeping them close rather than pushing them on to the opposition benches.\n\nAustria\u2019s crisis is a lesson for Europe: far-right parties are unfit to govern | Julia Ebner Read more\n\nNonetheless, there is strong opposition across the country to an \u00d6VP-FP\u00d6 alliance, as well as in Kurz\u2019s party. During the year-and-a-half in which the FP\u00d6 took part in Austria\u2019s government, it managed to rack up a large number of minor and major scandals.\n\nMartin Kotynek, writing in the newspaper Der Standard, said: \u201cThe coalition with the FP\u00d6 was a mistake. Kurz overestimated its capability for government. Now he has a chance to correct that mistake.\u201d\n\nThe FP\u00d6 was the only party not to be invited to hustings organised specifically for Austria\u2019s Jewish community. Bini Guttmann, the incoming president of the European Union of Jewish Students, described the party as \u201cstructurally antisemitic\u201d.\n\nKurz on Sunday night signalled he was willing to enter coalition talks with both FP\u00d6 and the Greens: \u201cI have promised to hold talks with all parties\u201d, the Vienna-born politician said. \u201cAnd I sure won\u2019t break my promise on the night of the vote.\u201d\n\nA \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with the SP\u00d6, which has been the norm for much of the period since the second world war, has come to be associated with political stasis and infighting, and would sit uneasily with Kurz\u2019s reformist agenda.\n\nIn his election manifesto, Kurz promised tax cuts for businesses and families and \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.5bn) in public spending reductions. \u201cI want to pursue decent centre-right politics,\u201d he told the state broadcaster \u00d6RF.\n\nIn the run-up to the election, Kurz and Kickl used the same slogan in their poster campaign \u2013 \u201cSomeone who speaks our language\u201d \u2013 next to a photo of the lead candidate.\n\nThe SP\u00d6, which is led by a woman, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, for the first time in its history, has struggled to profit from the corruption scandal.", "description": "Sebastian Kurz looks certain to reclaim his title of world\u2019s youngest leader as his \u00d6VP takes 37%", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35ef23c92ac53e74cd4f3f7fb94f3196a6c6daac/0_131_3511_2107/master/3511.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8701e61d7b430473b2da2b75be2778a", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
