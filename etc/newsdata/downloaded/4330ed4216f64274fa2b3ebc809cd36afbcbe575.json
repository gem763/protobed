The movie\u2019s release will also coincide with the third anniversary of George\u2019s death on Christmas Day in 2016.\n\nSadly, George isn\u2019t around to see his music bring magic to the love story of Emilia and Henry\u2019s characters Kate and Tom, but a close friend says he would have been thrilled by the mere idea of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShirlie Holliman, who sang as a backing singer for George\u2019s pop group Wham!, told Metro.co.uk: \u2018I know it would all have been done with his permission. So I\u2019m sure he had a talk about the movie.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s lovely to think I\u2019m going into Christmas and can have nice memories of Christmas and his music all around it. I just kind of go by my gut instincts and I do feel really good about this idea of this movie with all his songs in it.\u2019\n\nShirlie\u2019s husband Martin Kemp added: \u2018George was such a Christmas fan. It was his favourite time of the year and so I\u2019m sure he would have loved the idea of it.\u2019\n\nLast Christmas features classic songs from George\u2019s back catalogue\n\nCo-written by actress Emma Thompson, Last Christmas follows shop attendant Kate (Clarke) who bumps into Tom (Golding) by chance and embarks on a romance throughout the festive season.\n\nBasically the perfect Christmas rom-com we all need in our lives.\n\nShirlie, 58, shared her excitement for the release and said: \u2018I love a Christmas movie, I have to say. That\u2019s one of my big things because I don\u2019t like the winter, but I just love everything that is kind of romantic and shiny around Christmas. So I\u2019m really making sure that we go to the premiere as well.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nIt\u2019ll make a change to see Emilia in a more, well, non-fantasy role after Game of Thrones ended earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it seems we\u2019re not the only person who will have to try and not picture Emilia in the land of Westeros.\n\nMartin and Shirlie were close friends of George\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t seen [the movie yet]. You know, I don\u2019t even want to watch the trailer yet because I love Emilia Clarke,\u2019 Shirlie admitted.\n\n\u2018I was a massive Game of Thrones fan. So I\u2019ll have to try and get it out of my head that she\u2019s not Daenerys anymore, the Mother of Dragons.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m really excited about the movie.\u2019\n\nHusband and wife Martin and Shirlie have teamed up to release their first album together, In The Swing Of It, which is set for release on 22 November.\n\nAmong the George Michael songs set to feature in Last Christmas, include Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, Faith, Everything She Wants and, of course, the title track.\n\nLast Christmas hits UK cinemas on 15 November.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
