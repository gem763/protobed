Comey said Saturday he\u2019s not worried about a Justice Department criminal probe into the reasons his office investigated the Trump campaign in 2016, but he cautioned the federal prosecutor leading the probe to guard against influence from \u201cthose in leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not worried about a single thing in connection with any of the matters under investigation,\u201d Mr. Comey said at the annual Politicon conference in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cGather the facts, write a report and share it with the American people.\u201d\n\nU.S. Attorney John Durham, tapped by Attorney General William P. Barr to investigate the origins of the FBI\u2019s 2016 probe of possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, is low leading a criminal investigation. The president speculated Friday that it could implicate top former FBI officials including Mr. Comey for wrongly obtaining a court\u2019s permission to conduct surveillance of a Trump campaign official and others.\n\nMr. Comey said he has been \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about Mr. Barr\u2019s earlier characterization of the FBI\u2019s actions as \u201cspying\u201d on the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell what is going on with the attorney general and that investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they are looking at, so I\u2019m not in a position to say you should not investigate.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Durham has \u201ca strong reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would hope that Mr. Durham will do everything possible to protect his reputation from being damaged by those in the leadership,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cAnd the most important way to do that is to give us transparency. I\u2019m confident that when the American people see the picture of why we did what we did, their confidence in the institution will be maintained restored and protected.\u201d\n\nThe former FBI director also said that the House of Representatives \u201chas no choice\u201d but to move forward with an impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump after the president\u2019s appeals to Ukraine\u2019s leader to investigate Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cThe House has no choice but to pursue an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Mr. Comey said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly powerful grounds to investigate. If the news accounts are accurate, the president engaged in a shocking abuse of power.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
