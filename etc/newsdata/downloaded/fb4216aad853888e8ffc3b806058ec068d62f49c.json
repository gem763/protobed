The deadline for those requests for documents is Tuesday, according to the subpoenas.\n\nThe two leaders discussed U.S. military aid to Ukraine on the call, according to a rough transcript released by the White House. Trump also appeared to pressure Zelenskiy to work with the Justice Department and his personal lawyer to conduct investigations linked to the 2016 election and Biden, a potential 2020 rival.\n\nAt a news conference at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump said he decided to withhold the aid because of concerns about corruption, later adding that he wanted other European allies to pay for military aid to Ukraine as well.\n\nThe Pentagon announced plans in June to provide Ukraine with $250 million in security cooperation funds, after the administration had told Congress it was releasing the aid February and May. The money was unfrozen on Sept. 11, after lawmakers in the House and Senate raised questions about the delay.\n\n\u201cWe approved the money. The president signed it and we just assumed it was going out,\u201d House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith told NPR earlier this month. \u201cThen we started to hear from a variety of people that it was not going out.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper, in an interview with CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, said the Pentagon would \u201cdo everything we can to comply\u201d with the Democrats\u2019 subpoena.", "description": "House Democrats are seeking to interview White House budget director Russell Vought on Oct. 25, according to a copy of a letter obtained by ABC News.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/russell-vought-pol-jef-191014_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
