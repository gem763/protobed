Officials said they still do not know the cause of the lung injuries that are making people so sick. There have been seven confirmed deaths.\n\nAll reported cases had a history of e-cigarette or vaping use, officials have said. Initial data shows that most people had a history of using e-cigarette products containing THC, that many people said they used both nicotine and THC, and that some reported using only nicotine products. Many people have also said they used black market or illicit THC products. THC is the active ingredient in marijuana that produces the high.\n\nFDA officials said investigators from its Office of Criminal Investigations have been pursuing a parallel investigation since shortly after the illnesses were first reported this summer. That office conducts criminal investigations of illegal activities involving FDA-regulated products, arresting those responsible and bringing them before the Justice Department for prosecution.\n\nTo allay fears of sick patients who have used illicit marijuana products, some of whom have been reluctant to share information with public health officials, the FDA is not pursuing prosecution of people for personal use of any controlled substances.\n\n\u201cThe focus is on the supply chain,\u201d said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA\u2019s Center for Tobacco Products. \u201cWe\u2019re all alarmed by reports about THC-containing products,\u201d he said, even if THC has not been present in every case.\n\nIn some states where marijuana is not legal, the only way for someone to purchase a THC product is \u201cbuying it in an alley or on the street,\u201d Zeller said. \u201cI would be very, very careful about doing that,\u201d he warned, because consumers have no way of knowing \u201cwhat might have happened along the way from the product being put in the hands of the end user to the moment of aerosolization or inhalation.\u201d\n\nHealth officials are warning people who are concerned about these specific health risks to consider refraining from using e-cigarette or vaping products. If adults are trying to quit smoking by using nicotine-containing e-cigarettes, they should not return to smoking cigarettes.\n\nMarijuana industry experts have said that black-market operators have added thickening agents to THC oil that is used to fill vape cartridges. At least one such \u201ccutting agent\u201d used to dilute solutions, vitamin E acetate, an oil derived from vitamin E, has been found in samples tested by state labs and the FDA\u2019s forensics lab. But officials cautioned again Thursday that they have not identified a single e-cigarette product or substance as the underlying culprit. A form of chemical exposure is suspected of making patients ill.\n\nThe FDA is analyzing more than 150 samples collected from patients across the country who have fallen ill and is testing them for a broad range of chemicals, including nicotine, THC, cutting agents and other substances.\n\nVitamin E acetate is commonly available as a nutritional supplement and is used in topical skin treatments. It is not known to cause harm when ingested as a vitamin supplement or applied to the skin. Its name sounds harmless, experts said, but its molecular structure could make it hazardous when inhaled. It could be associated with the kinds of respiratory symptoms that many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain, officials said. In some instances, they have also reported vomiting or diarrhea.\n\n\u201cThis is a complex investigation that spans many states and involves hundreds of cases and a wide variety of substances and products,\u201d Anne Schuchat, the CDC\u2019s principal deputy director, said during a call with reporters. \u201cWe at CDC are very concerned about the occurrence of life-threatening illnesses in otherwise healthy young people reported from around the country.\u201d\n\nSchuchat said a variety of hypotheses are being considered. \u201cThere may be a problem with source material or modification that may be occurring at different places,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cit may take some time\u201d to obtain definitive answers.\n\nMore than half of the reported cases are in people under 25, Schuchat said. Boys and men make up three-fourths of the patients; two-thirds of patients are between 18 and 34, and 16 percent are younger than 18.\n\nSome of the additional cases reported Thursday are from investigations conducted several weeks ago, Schuchat said. But new cases continue to be reported in the ongoing outbreak, she said.\n\nIllinois\u2019s chief medical officer, Jennifer Layden, said state officials hope to find more clues by collecting information from people who vape but have not gotten sick. Some of Illinois\u2019s 69 patients are unable to talk to health-care professionals because of the severity of their illnesses or because they are reluctant to share information about illicit products they have used, she said.\n\nOfficials plan to use social media to solicit responses for an anonymous survey about vaping habits to help identify what is making people sick, she said.\n\nOn Monday, California reported the death of a 40-year-old man from vaping-related illnesses. That death is at least the fifth reported in a middle-aged or older person.\n\nRead more:\n\nContaminant found in marijuana products linked to deadly lung illnesses, tests show\n\nSeveral deaths in vaping-related illnesses are in middle-aged or older people\n\nDeadly lung illness may be a new pulmonary disease related to vaping", "description": "Federal health officials say 530 people have been sickened in 38 states by a mysterious vaping-related illness.", "authors": ["Lena H.
