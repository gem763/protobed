Read more\n\nJohnson had executed a major policy U-turn at the end of last week by accepting that there could not be a customs border on the island of Ireland, raising some optimism on both sides of the channel.\n\nUnder his alternative proposal, a pared down version of Theresa May\u2019s customs partnership, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union.\n\nBut the UK would agree to enforce the bloc\u2019s customs rules and tariffs on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland. There would be a rebate system to compensate businesses impacted.\n\nBut Barnier told the ambassadors that it would involve an untried system of tracking of goods and he spoke of the risks that would be facing the single market. \u201cThere were lots of ifs and maybes \u2013 too many\u201d, said one EU diplomat of the discussions.\n\nOne senior EU diplomat warned it would be impossible to hammer out a \u201ctotally new concept\u201d to replace the Irish backstop within days.\n\nThe source said the UK would not be able leave the EU with a deal as scheduled on 31 October unless it embraces a previous plan, the Northern Ireland only backstop - the EU\u2019s original proposal that would leave the region in an EU customs union and following most single market rules.\n\nIf the UK wanted a brand-new concept on customs for Northern Ireland a deal is \u201cimpossible\u201d by the end of October said the diplomat.\n\nThere is frustration in Brussels that Johnson\u2019s government waited so long to table a set of proposals that contain many gaps.\n\nNegotiations will continue throughout Monday. Barnier will brief EU ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday evening.\n\nOn Sunday, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said he would back such a prolongation of the UK\u2019s membership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits to decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d Juncker told the Austrian newspaper Kurier on Sunday. \u201cBut if Boris Johnson were to ask for extra time \u2013 which probably he won\u2019t \u2013 I would consider it unhistoric to refuse such a request.\u201d\n\nJohnson updated his cabinet on Sunday lunchtime about the state of play in negotiations with Brussels before a make-or-break week for his premiership.\n\nThe prime minister is still hoping to make enough progress at a European council meeting on Thursday to be able to hold a Commons vote on his Brexit plans in a rare Saturday sitting next weekend.\n\nMay\u2019s customs plan was vehemently rejected by Brexiters as impractical. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the then chair of the hardline European Research Group of Tory MPs, described it as \u201ccompletely cretinous, impractical, bureaucratic and a betrayal of common sense\u201d.\n\nBut Rees-Mogg, who is now leader of the House of Commons, made clear on Sunday he and other leavers were prepared to compromise.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson is \u2026 somebody who even the most arch-Eurosceptic, even a member of the Brexit party, can trust and have confidence in,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked by Sophy Ridge on Sky News if he might have to eat his words on the idea of a customs partnership, Rees-Mogg added: \u201cI don\u2019t know but there\u2019s a line from Churchill saying he\u2019d often had to eat his own words and he found it a very nourishing diet. That is something that happens in politics but it is ultimately a question of trust and about the direction in which we are going.\u201d", "description": "Barnier warns negotiations may have to continue after leaders\u2019 summit this week as UK\u2019s Irish border plans an \u2018untested\u2019 risk", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey", "Heather Stewart", "Jennifer Rankin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c37e8e16e0d4ba5e06b236611588803a1767bd6b/0_115_4822_2893/master/4822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86d2e058c4bdd041680a350866a2bcae", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
