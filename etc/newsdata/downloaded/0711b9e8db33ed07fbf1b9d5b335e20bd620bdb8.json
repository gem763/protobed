REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo\n\nThe accounting sector faces a shake-up in Britain after collapses at builder Carillion and retailer BHS raised questions about the quality of auditing by the world\u2019s biggest accounting firms and how effectively they are regulated.\n\nCompanies currently set out in annual reports why they think they can remain a \u201cgoing concern\u201d for the next 12 months, but the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) wants them to take a longer view.\n\nHow companies have justified their going concern assessment has become a political issue after the collapse of travel firm Thomas Cook, prompting the FRC to take a harder line.\n\n\u201cThe FRC expects companies to think beyond the period covered by their viability statement and identify those key risks that challenge their business models in the medium to longer term and have a particular focus on environmental issues,\u201d the watchdog said in a statement.\n\nIt made its comments in a public letter from the FRC\u2019s new chief executive Jon Thompson to the heads of audit committees at companies as they start preparing their 2019/20 annual reports.\n\nThe FRC said that in times of uncertainty, whether created by political events, general economic conditions or operational challenges, investors look for greater transparency in corporate reports to inform their decision-making.\n\n\u201cWe expect companies to consider carefully the detail provided in those areas of their reports which are exposed to heightened levels of risk; for example, descriptions of how they have approached going concern considerations, the impact of Brexit and all areas of material estimation uncertainty,\u201d it said.\n\nThe FRC wants companies to spell out the impact of market transition from the tarnished Libor interest rate benchmark to a new interest rate for financial contracts by the end of 2021.\n\n\u201cThis should include early consideration of the need to re-negotiate relevant contracts and agreements,\u201d the FRC said.\n\nThe watchdog also published its annual review of company reports, saying it continues to see \u201cbasic errors\u201d in how cash flows are reported.\n\nThe FRC also has concerns over the level of disclosure around supplier financing arrangements.", "description": "Companies must take a longer view in spelling out to shareholders the risks they face from issues such as Brexit and climate change, Britain's audit watchdog said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446458116&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0I7", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
