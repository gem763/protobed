They don\u2019t like that, so they say: \u2018Fuck you, we\u2019re going to teach you people. And they have to know they\u2019re going to be taught \u2026 they can\u2019t get away with bullying us \u2013 people who have common sense and see what is happening in this world, and in this country. They cannot do it. It\u2019s a shame, it\u2019s a shame that [the Republicans] behave so badly.\u201d\n\nOn being asked whether he thought Trump was likely to be jailed as a result of the current impeachment inquiry, De Niro said: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to see him in jail. I don\u2019t want him to die, I want him to go to jail.\u201d\n\nDe Niro returned to the theme while recording an episode of The Graham Norton Show, due for broadcast on Friday 11 October. He said: \u201cToday, we have a weird, twisted president who thinks he\u2019s a gangster, who\u2019s not even a very good gangster \u2026 Gangsters have honour, you shake a hand and they have your word and you have theirs and that\u2019s it. But with this guy, it\u2019s not the case.\u201d", "description": "The Irishman actor tells the Guardian that Trump and the Republicans \u2018have to know they can\u2019t get away with bullying us\u2019", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e6b568502d9a243fb2e85bf02aa41c63966fd3f/684_140_2612_1568/master/2612.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a09be8825f0c34d6456a56f55a8e0924", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
