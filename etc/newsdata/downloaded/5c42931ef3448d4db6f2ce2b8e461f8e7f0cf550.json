Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is aiming for a show of force with a rally at Queensbridge Park in Queens, New York, on Saturday. It's his first campaign event since suffering a heart attack.\n\nThe presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) secured the endorsements of three additional New York lawmakers ahead of his comeback rally in Queens on Saturday: state Sens. Michael Gianaris and Jessica Ramos of Queens, and state Sen. Luis Sep\u00falveda of the Bronx.\n\n\u201cBernie is the best candidate to fight back against the deep-pocketed corporate interests that weaken our democracy and exploit our economy,\u201d Ramos, who unseated a Queens Democrat aligned with state Republicans in September 2018, said in a statement announcing her endorsement. \u201cIn Senator Sanders we have a leader who will protect all members of our society, especially those seeking human rights and better working conditions free from unethical practices.\u201d\n\nGianaris, who as deputy state Senate majority leader is one of the most powerful Democrats in New York, echoed Ramos\u2019 sentiments. \u201cBernie Sanders is the best choice to reduce this growing chasm between the ultra-rich and working people,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe trio joins a group of five New York lawmakers who had already endorsed Sanders\u2019 bid: New York City Councilman Rafael Espinal, state Assemblymen Ron Kim and Phil Steck, and state Sens. Julia Salazar and James Sanders. (James Sanders is not related to the Vermont senator.)\n\nAlthough New Yorkers cast ballots in the Democratic presidential primary in April, well after the crucial early states, some presidential contenders have already sought endorsements from the state\u2019s robust bench of young, progressive lawmakers. Sanders still has fewer endorsements from New York state and New York City elected officials than Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who announced that she had secured the backing of 14 lawmakers at a mid-September rally in Manhattan.\n\nSanders, 78, is hoping to regain momentum after suffering a heart attack on Oct. 1 that polling indicates raised doubts in the minds of many Democrats about his fitness to serve in the White House.\n\nSanders, seeking to reassure the public of his health and vitality, delivered a strong debate performance on Tuesday and hours later announced he\u2019d secured endorsements from Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, two of the Democratic Party\u2019s young, progressive stars.\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally in Queensbridge Park, chosen in part for its proximity to the country\u2019s largest public housing development, is Sanders\u2019 first major campaign event since his hospitalization.\n\nHe will be joined onstage at the rally by Ocasio-Cortez, who is expected to formally announce her endorsement there. Sanders courted Ocasio-Cortez in conversations over the course of a month, culminating in a visit she paid to Burlington, Vermont, at the end of September. She met with Sanders and his wife, as well as a group of aides, over two meals, where they developed a rapport, according to someone familiar with Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s thinking.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s endorsement of Sanders is not altogether surprising. Ocasio-Cortez got her start in politics volunteering for Sanders\u2019 2016 bid; the pair are both self-described democratic socialists and have collaborated on, among other things, legislation limiting interest rates on credit card debt.\n\nBut prior to announcing her endorsement of Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez had spoken positively about Warren, too. And Warren had apparently made efforts to develop a relationship with her.\n\nOcasio-Cortez was drawn to Sanders\u2019 vision of a rejuvenated democracy where ordinary Americans take a more active role in the political process, according to the person with knowledge of her thinking.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ideologically aligned, but they\u2019re mission-aligned as well,\u201d the person said. \u201cThey get along really well. They brighten each other up.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s rally will give Ocasio-Cortez an opportunity to show if her star power is a major draw for aspiring national leaders.\n\n\u201cIf he gets enough of the young, left-wing demo out, the age issue disappears, the health issue is softened and Bernie gets new life. It makes him young again,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran New York City Democratic strategist. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get a big crowd, then those two issues remain in place.\u201d\n\nMichael Ceraso, a Democratic campaign consultant who worked on Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, expressed doubt that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s blessing would help him broaden his appeal \u201cin the areas where he has deficits,\u201d such as older voters.\n\nBut it is likely to help him maximize turnout among the young voters Sanders is relying on to carve a path to the Democratic nomination, according to Ceraso.\n\nOcasio-Cortez \u201cresonates with those young voters who are looking for a reason to vote,\u201d he said.", "description": "Eight Empire State lawmakers now back the Vermont senator\u2019s Democratic presidential bid.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5daa7bd52000009f11506272.jpeg?cache=5r8mx7icor&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
