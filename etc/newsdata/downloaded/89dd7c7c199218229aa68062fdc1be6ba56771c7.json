Kamala Harris (D-CA) with obviously fake allegations of an extramarital affair.\n\nAnd like past efforts to manufacture sexual claims against Trump foes\u2014from Robert Mueller, to Pete Buttigieg, to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\u2014the Harris charade fell apart quickly.\n\nThe pair\u2019s bogus accuser\u201426-year-old Sean Newaldass\u2014told The Daily Beast on Friday that he had no idea the event in which he alleged that he was in a romantic dalliance with the Senate was real. That\u2019s because Newaldass had met Wohl and Burkman by replying to an ad posted on Craigslist seeking a \u201cmale actor\u201d for \u201cperformance art.\u201d When he showed up at Burkman\u2019s Virginia home and delivered his lines alleging an affair, Newaldass was under the belief that the press conference was actually an audition for a Spike TV show. He said he had no idea that Harris was a politician. Indeed, he assumed she was a fictional person.\n\n\u201cI thought I was acting for a role in a movie, like a role in a TV series,\u201d Newaldass said. \u201cI thought everything was staged, I\u2019m thinking everyone is an actor.\u201d\n\nNewaldass insists that he believed that everyone at the event, from Wohl and Burkman, to the reporters asking questions, and a heckler dressed as a corncob, were all actors. Wohl promised Newaldass $500 to appear at the event\u2014money that Newaldass said he still has yet to receive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking this is going to be like The Office ,\u201d Newaldass said. \u201c The Office has super dry humor.\u201d\n\nNewaldass\u2019s allegations are shocking even by Wohl and Burkman\u2019s standards. The duo are known for hamfisted attempts to manufacture smears against political figures and for roping in unwitting participants into their schemes. But they have never concocted a fake TV show in order to execute their plans before.\n\nAs Newaldass realized Wednesday afternoon that the event was real, and that he was being treated as an outright liar on social media, he said he became afraid to leave his home.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was the most hurt I\u2019ve ever received from anything in the world,\u201d Newaldass said.\n\nAsked over Instagram direct message whether he had tricked Newaldass, Wohl responded with only a laughing-crying emoji. Burkman, a lawyer and lobbyist whose membership in the D.C. Bar was recently suspended over unpaid dues, didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time one of Wohl and Burkman\u2019s fake accusers has turned on them. Their Mueller accuser, Carolyne Cass, failed to show up at a much-hyped press conference and later said Wohl and Burkman had made up the claims. College student Hunter Kelly, whose name Burkman and Wohl used to accuse Buttigieg of sexual assault, turned on the pair even faster than Cass, sending out mocking tweets about their press conference announcing his claims as it happened. Their missteps don\u2019t end there. Wohl is set to be arraigned on a felony charge for unlawful sale of securities later this month in California.\n\nNewaldass said he first entered Wohl\u2019s orbit by replying to the Craigslist ad, which makes no mention of politics, Burkman and Wohl, or Harris. Shortly after responding, according to Newaldass, he was contacted by Burkman and Wohl. The phone number that Newaldass said Wohl used to contact him is the same as a number Wohl has used in the past to text and make phones call to a reporter at The Daily Beast.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Wohl and Burkman got Newaldass an Uber to Burkman\u2019s home in Rosslyn, Virginia. Newaldass said he was told the house belonged to Spike TV, a network that no longer exists after parent company Viacom changed the channel\u2019s name to the Paramount Network in 2018.\n\n\u201cI was told, \u2018This is the audition for a TV show that\u2019s going to be on Spike,\u2019\u201d Newaldass said. \u201cAnd I can be a personal trainer on the show, right?\u201d\n\nNewaldass said Burkman and Wohl showed him the statement he would read on Wednesday , but described it as a \u201cscript.\u201d Newaldass found the claims in the statement bizarre, but considered that he had seen similarly strange things in other movies and TV shows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to hold my laughs back because I\u2019m like, \u2018This is funny,\u2019\u201d Newaldass said. \u201cWhat kind of comedy is this?\u201d\n\nBurkman and Wohl later emailed him the \u201cscript,\u201d according to Newaldass, but not without their signature ineptness. Newaldass initially received a statement from the pair making a series of different sexual allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 apparently because Wohl or Burkman mixed up their smears and attached the wrong file to the email. After he asked Wohl for clarification, they sent the Harris statement instead. Newaldass began to practice what he thought would be his lines.\n\nNewaldass arrived at Burkman\u2019s house around noon Wednesday, a few hours before the press conference. He said two other people\u2014a singer and a purported reverend who would perform a blessing at the press conference\u2014were just as nervous as he was, preparing their lines as though they were getting ready for a performance. It wasn\u2019t clear to Newaldass whether the other two people were also actors or similarly oblivious to what was actually happening, but the \u201cminister\u201d later told The Daily Dot that he was not actually a reverend and appeared \u201cconfused\u201d about the event.\n\nAs hecklers and a handful of reporters gathered on Burkman\u2019s sidewalk, inside, Burkman and Wohl encouraged Newaldass by talking up his future Hollywood career. Newaldass said Wohl claimed to be a \u201cdirector,\u201d and both men encouraged him to sign the statement making allegations against Harris\u2014 a signature they would later use as proof that he really believed the claims.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re encouraging me like, \u2018Man, you\u2019re going to be a star, you\u2019re a lead actor,\u2019\u201d Wohl said.\n\nNewaldass\u2019s press conference devolved into farce almost as soon as it began, with a mystery man delivering an apparently fake cease-and-desist notice that Burkman claimed was from Harris\u2019s campaign and Wohl threatening to spray hecklers with a garden hose. Newaldass read the statement to the crowd, convinced, he said, that Harris was a fictional character.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m completely oblivious to who this person is,\u201d Newaldass told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhile Newaldass was able to read from his statement, he became confused when asked to answer questions from the crowd, since he thought he needed to read lines. In an interview later with a Daily Dot reporter, Burkman and Wohl repeatedly cut in whenever the reporter asked Newaldass a question.\n\nNewaldass said he left the event with promises from Burkman and Wohl for future opportunities in Hollywood, and even the prospect of an entire TV series and potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars. Newaldass began to think about how a role on a hit TV show would enable him to provide for his family financially.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what really sucked me in, thinking, \u2018Man, I can take care of everybody,\u2019\u201d Newaldass said.\n\nWhen he got home afterwards, though, Newaldass said he slowly began to realize he had been tricked. His Instagram page filled up with accusations that he was a liar. Newaldass began to doubt Wohl and Burkman\u2019s claim that they were just filming a show for Spike TV, and he became afraid to go outside.\n\n\u201cI was scared out of my mind,\u201d Newaldass said.\n\nNewaldass felt that he had embarrassed his family, and worried about what his family and friends would think of him.\n\n\u201cThe people that actually pay attention to this stuff are really judging me,\u201d Newaldass said.\n\nNewaldass insists that he had never heard of Harris before the press conference. And on that front, he isn\u2019t alone \u2014 12 percent of respondents in a Morning Consult poll this month said they had never heard of the senator. After researching Harris, Newaldass said he\u2019s now likely to vote for her presidential bid.\n\nNewaldass said the ruse especially stings because, like Harris, Newaldass is of mixed Indian and Carribbean ancestry.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s hurtful, because I\u2019m hurting my own ethnicity,\u201d Newaldass said.", "description": "The duo behind botched smears against Elizabeth Warren, Robert Mueller, and Pete Buttigieg have truly outdone themselves.", "authors": ["Will Sommer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570825574/191011-Sommer-Harris-tease_ww0frd", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
