The already anxious, clattering sound design is punctuated by the violent puff of the laser gun.\n\nThere are inklings that Jamie Bell\u2019s Widner might not be like the other skinheads; he cares for his dog and plays family man to single mother Julie (Danielle Macdonald). It\u2019s this new relationship that makes him think twice about knifing black kids and torching mosques as a member of the racist Vinlanders Social Club and so the film follows his attempts to extricate himself from his \u201cfamily\u201d.\n\nBell is magnetic in the role, and there\u2019s real chemistry between him and Macdonald, but the film\u2019s formal glossiness and frequent overhead shots create distance between the viewer and the hate crimes on display. The film works hard to complicate the character of Widner, but flattens the pernicious culture that formed him.", "description": "The true story of Bryon Widner, who had his white supremacist tattoos removed", "authors": ["Simran Hans"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df3011cb03cabc30cb0a370104ef41f418eefeba/188_69_1005_603/master/1005.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bbf5db47a5cf85fc57535b575b34499f", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
