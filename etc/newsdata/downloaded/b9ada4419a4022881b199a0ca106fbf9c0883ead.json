There\u2019s a good reason for this.\n\nAll stressful situations trigger a cascade of hormonal and physiological changes in your body. When it senses a perceived threat, the body\u2019s sympathetic nervous system causes the adrenal glands to release various hormones like adrenaline, noradrenaline, and cortisol. These are what cause your skin to get pale and sweaty, your heart rate and blood pressure to spike, your pupils to dilate, and your muscles to start trembling when you find yourself in a sticky situation.\n\nKnown as the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response, these reactions are normal and designed to help you deal with a threat (fight) or flee to protect yourself (flight). Once things quiet down, the hormones and symptoms subside over a couple of minutes or hours and things return to normal.\n\nBack in prehistoric times, the fight or flight response enabled people to survive wild animal attacks and other life-threatening events. But these days, this overblown bodily process tends to cause more problems than it solves.\n\nThankfully, we don\u2019t typically encounter wild animal attacks (or similar threats) in our daily lives\u2014at least not on a regular basis. Rather, today\u2019s stressors tend to be related to the twists and turns of everyday life, whether it\u2019s short term (like a looming deadline at work or a frustrating traffic jam) or long term (such as a health concern, marital strain, or financial woes).\n\nThe thing is, your body\u2019s response is just as powerful and acute. And, physiologically, this constant stress response elicits a steady, nonstop release of hormones from your adrenal glands. The most concerning is cortisol.\n\nTo be fair, short-term bursts of cortisol help the body survive periods of acute stress. Cortisol raises blood sugar which provides energy, and pulls minerals from bones so that they can feed the muscles, prepping them in case they need to be used for defense.\n\nHowever, with chronic stress, cortisol levels never get a chance to fully dissipate and return to normal. Constantly elevated cortisol can result in some serious problems, including elevated blood sugar, weight gain/fat accumulation, high blood pressure, and loss of bone and muscle mass. Over the long term, it increases risk of diabetes, heart disease, and other debilitating conditions.\n\nThe fact is, we will never be able to fully eliminate all stressors from our lives. Work will always have deadlines. Traffic will always be a problem. For some, chronic disease is a daily battle that doesn\u2019t go away. For others, money or marital problems simply can\u2019t be resolved overnight.\n\nBut we can do the next best thing: Lessen the dangerous effects of cortisol.\n\nGet My FREE Curcumin Report Chronic Inflammation Decoded\n\nIncreasing Your Resistance to Stress\n\nWhen it comes to combatting the dangers associated with stress, supplements called adaptogens can offer remarkable powers.\n\nAdaptogens are plant extracts that boost your resistance to the effects of stress, in part by targeting the hormones released by your adrenals (including cortisol). As their name suggests, adaptogens allow your body to adapt \u2013 mentally, physically and emotionally \u2013 to situations and pressures, without disrupting other biological functions.\n\nThere are several different adaptogens that have been shown to help ease the body\u2019s reaction to stress, including:\n\nAshwagandha . In a study of 64 people with a history of chronic stress, participants received either Ashwagandha or placebo for 60 days. Results showed that those taking the herb had substantially reduced blood levels of cortisol compared to the placebos, and also an improvement in stress-related symptoms. 1 The recommended dose is 250\u2013500 mg daily.\n\n.

In one study, researchers reviewed the available literature to \u201creach a clinically meaningful strategy for prevention and treatment of persistent stress symptoms and their consequences\u2026\u201d They concluded that Rhodiola rosea influences the release of stress hormones and offers comprehensive treatment of stress symptoms while also preventing stress-related complications.2 Daily dosages range from 200\u2013600 mg.\n\nAmino Acids\n\nOther important tools in the fight against stress are amino acids\u2014in particular GABA and L-theanine.\n\nGABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric acid) is naturally produced by the brain and acts as a calming neurotransmitter. GABA steps in at the conclusion of a stressful event and helps release serotonin and other \u201cfeel good\u201d hormones that ease stress and anxiety.\n\nSupplementing with GABA has been shown to increase alpha waves in the brain, which are associated with calmness and peace. The recommended daily dosage of GABA is 100 mg.\n\nLikewise, L-theanine is a calming amino acid. In an interesting study of 34 adults, a drink containing L-theanine was found to significantly lower stress one hour after consumption. Salivary cortisol levels also fell three hours after participants drank the beverage.3\n\nTaken in supplement form, the recommended daily dose for L-theanine is 200 mg.\n\nYou can take these nutrients individually, or you can look for stress-relief products that combine various adaptogens and GABA/L-theanine into one formula.\n\nLike it or not, stress is a part of life. You can\u2019t always control the circumstances that cause you to be stressed out, but you can take control of how you react to them. Give these supplements a try, and be patient as in some people they take a few days or weeks to fully take effect.\n\nReferences\n\nDid You Enjoy This Article?
