You know, I can\u2019t be changing people every five minutes here. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta give Case an ample opportunity to play with these new guys. This is his first time in this offense. We\u2019re not gonna be perfect, but we need to be better. And I think we can get better. Otherwise if I didn\u2019t think we had a chance to get better, I would make a change. But I feel like Case has the tools to become a very efficient quarterback in this offense and get us some victories here moving forward.\u201d\n\nKeenum is a known commodity\n\nAside from his single season with the Minnesota Vikings that saw him win 11 games as a starter in 2017, Keenum has done little in his career to inspire the kind of confidence Gruden is placing in him.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Minnesota, he was surrounded by superior talent. In Washington, he is not. In Denver last season, he was not. With the Rams and Texans before Minnesota, he was not. And he did nothing to prove himself as a quarterback who can account for wins in any of those stops.\n\nHe\u2019s a middling starter, at best, who\u2019s better suited as an NFL backup.\n\nJay Gruden is hesitant to hand the keys over to Dwayne Haskins even though Case Keenum is clearly not the path to victory. (Getty)\n\nTaking a chance on Haskins could actually benefit Gruden\n\nBut this isn\u2019t about Keenum. It\u2019s about Gruden, whose already hot seat was turned up a few notches during Monday\u2019s loss to the Bears.\n\nAt this rate, he\u2019ll be lucky to survive the season in Washington. And coaches coaching for their jobs don\u2019t tend to instill their faith in rookie quarterbacks who don\u2019t provide the best prospects of posting wins.\n\nBut sticking with Keenum clearly isn\u2019t the path to victory.\n\nIt made perfect sense for Gruden to not throw Haskins to the wolves on Monday facing a double-digit deficit against a buzzsaw Bears defense. That\u2019s no way to introduce a rookie quarterback to the league.\n\nBut for the sake of the team and his own employment prospects, rolling the dice on Haskins sooner than later is the prudent decision.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jay Gruden is hesitant to hand the keys over to Dwayne Haskins even though Case Keenum is clearly not the path to victory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V0bKfi17_47ADEDrXzegxQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a050dbgWRtF8OUxHmigPMQ--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/eb6ffad0-de82-11e9-9ff7-97ec46812ffa", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
