More than half the 272 works in this sale are by Indigenous artists \u2013 adding to the hundreds of native artworks already dispersed by the Lavertys.\n\nLorna Fencer Napurrurla's Spring Water at Yumarlpa is expected to sell for $7000 to $9000.\n\nEschewing art auctions, the couple bought almost entirely from galleries, or, as with much of their Aboriginal art, in the field from local artists and co-ops during their extensive travels.\n\nThe couple knew and supported Kovacs, based in Bundeena south of Sydney, and the latest sale is dominated by works demonstrating the changing face of her art over a 40-year painting career.\n\nWalangkura Napanangka\u2019s Untitled\n\nEleven of her pictures will go under the hammer next week, ranging from Orange Glow from 2008, 76cm by 56cm in acrylic paint on paper estimated at $4000 to $6000, to Wonder 2017, a 1.2m by 84cm oil at $10,000 to $15,000. Dallas, a 2004 picture 76cm by 1m, is $10,000 to $15,000. At the upper levels, priced at around $30,000, are the 2m wide paintings Ghost from 2006 and For You from 2004. Works from the early 2000s include Bamboo and Sparkler, both around 165cm high and estimated at $12,000 to $18,000. In recent times her work has veered more into spidery \u201cwire works\u201d which are also well represented here.\n\nThe Art Sales Digest database lists Kovacs\u2019 most expensive picture at auction as Boot from 2001, which brought $87,840 as part of the Laverty collection at Bonhams in March 2013, and the 2.4m wide Float, which sold for $57,600 from the Gary Sands collection at Shapiro in February this year. Three other Kovacs from the Lavertys are on the records as having sold for more than $40,000.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther artists evidently favoured by the medical couple include Richard Larter, Robert Klippel, Tom Risley and Michael Taylor, while among indigenous art, works by Lorna Fencer Napurrurla and Paddy Wainburranga stand out. It is strong in Papunya Tula artists, including Walangkura Napanangka, and works from Balgo and the Tiwi Islands.\n\nThere are a number of prints by the likes of Kitty Kantilla, Queenie McKenzie and John Mawurndjul, some now relatively rare.\n\nDemonstrating the Lavertys\u2019 shifting tastes over the years, a couple of paintings bought in the 1980s include Reginald Borstel\u2019s study of a French clipper Nal, 1907, and P Brunswick\u2019s racehorse study Ampier from 1903.\n\nThe auctioneer\u2019s chief executive Andrew Shapiro will not be drawn on whether new records are likely, but clearly with works fresh to the market with the imprimatur of a distinguished collecting couple it would not surprise.\n\nptrfish8@gmail.com", "description": "The latest sale from the Laverty collection sees 272 lots go under the hammer \u2013 more than half by Indigenous artists.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6287%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_23/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3be8c3c985988f4a3f63f8ec2b42a639af63b9b0", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
