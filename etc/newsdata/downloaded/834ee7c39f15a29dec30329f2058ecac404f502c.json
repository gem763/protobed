Democratic rival Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, has backed bans on lobbying for ex-lawmakers, too, as have some Republican lawmakers, though critics say such measures would be unconstitutional.\n\nThe \u201cMoney Out of Politics Plan\u201d from Sanders also would replace the Federal Election Commission with a Federal Election Administration, as the FEC has become \u201cworthless\u201d while the new FEA would be \u201ca true law enforcement agency,\u201d the Sanders campaign said in a news release. In a reference to the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Citizens United v. FEC decision, the plan also promises to deliver a constitutional amendment that \u201cmakes clear that money is not speech and corporations are not people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money,\u201d Sanders said in the release.\n\nHis latest policy proposal comes after his campaign late Friday disclosed that the \u201cchest discomfort\u201d that the 78-year-old politician experienced last Tuesday was in fact a heart attack, as some experts suspected. The Sanders campaign has been criticized for not being more forthcoming earlier, and some pundits are now even questioning his White House bid. CNN columnist Jay Parini wrote that Sanders might want to drop out and endorse Warren, while an editor at the American Conservative, Rod Dreher, tweeted that the Vermont lawmaker \u201chas no business running for president\u201d following the health scare.\n\nThe heart attack has brought fresh attention to how the 2020 White House race involves several septuagenarians and instances of ageism. Besides Sanders at age 78, Democratic front-runner Joe Biden is 76, Warren is 70, and Trump is 73.\n\nSanders, for his part, has sounded upbeat and is scheduled to take part in an Oct. 15 primary debate.\n\n\u201cAfter two and a half days in the hospital, I feel great, and after taking a short time off, I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d he said in a statement late Friday.", "description": "Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders on Monday takes the wraps off a plan targeting Corporate America\u2019s role in politics, with the move coming as...", "authors": ["Victor Reklaitis", "Money", "Politics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS784_sander_ZG_20191007110935.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
