This was the standard observed throughout Hunter\u2019s professional career. When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith. He never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the president of the United States.\u201c\n\nFor his part, Trump mocked Hunter Biden on Twitter.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL,\u201c he said Sunday morning.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg used Hunter Biden\u2019s decision to highlight what he said indicated differences between the Bidens and the Trumps.\n\n\u201cHere you have Hunter Biden stepping down from a position in order to make sure, even though there's been no accusation of wrongdoing, doing something just to make sure there's not even the appearance of a conflict of interests, while, in the White House, the president of the United States is a walking conflict of interests,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nButtigieg added: \u201cThe president's sons go around the world pretending like the fact that their father is the president of the United States has no impact on the international business dealings that they do.\u201c\n\nMesires stated that were Joe Biden to become president, his son would avoid any possible conflict of interest.\n\n\u201cUnder a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.\u201c\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Attorney George Mesires"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/ec/cb7493f749d09c1c544f354f4561/20191013-hunter-biden-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
