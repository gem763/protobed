It isn\u2019t. It\u2019s real, and it works because Mrs. Clinton has been in a fantasy world since she lost to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn the months and years since her humiliating loss, she blamed James Comey, Russia, computer bots, WikiLeaks, Bernie Sanders, Facebook, Joe Biden, fake news, Twitter, voter ID laws, the vast right-wing conspiracy, sexism, Barack Obama, ageism, Anthony Weiner, white women, xenophobia, black people, the Electoral College, the DNC, misogyny, and women cowed by their husbands.\n\nSo you\u2019ve got to wonder: What color is the sky in Hillary\u2019s Clinton\u2019s world?\n\nIt never ends. Mrs. Clinton is still on TV all the time, and last week she came out with the most delusional statement yet, saying she could beat Mr. Trump \u201cagain.\u201d\n\nUh, Hillary, we have some terrible news. Really awful news. See, nearly three years ago, when we held a national election, you, um, lost.\n\nUnbeknownst to you, apparently, America has this thing called the Electoral College. It was designed by the Founding Fathers, in all their wisdom, and here\u2019s how it works: Each state selects \u201celectors\u201d \u2014 by today, 538 in all \u2014 and to win the presidency, a candidate needs to have at least 270 electoral votes.\n\nHere\u2019s where the bad news comes in, Hill. Yes, more people voted for you, and you won the popular vote 65,853,652 to 62,985,134. But that doesn\u2019t matter. Not in the least. In the Electoral College, you lost \u2014 really, really bad.\n\nMr. Trump pulled in 304 electoral votes, and you got just 227. See, you lost Michigan and Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania and a whole bunch of other states. In fact, Mr. Trump won 30 states, you won 20. And Mr. Trump won 2,626 counties while you won just 487.\n\nMr. Trump, in a helpful post on Twitter last week, showed the map: Nearly all states were red, with a few small blue splotches on the coasts and in the Midwest.\n\nThe president also posted a tweet in which he said he hoped Mrs. Clinton would run again. \u201cI think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u2018C\u2019 Subpoena!\u201d he wrote.\n\nHillary, of course, had to respond. \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nBut wait. She just said it \u2014 HIS job. So \u2026 he IS president. You didn\u2019t really win after all.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s lucidity was fleeting. The two-time presidential loser a short time later went on TV again to claim that Mr. Trump is \u201cobsessed\u201d with her.\n\n\u201cIt truly is remarkable how obsessed he remains with me,\u201d she said on the PBS \u201cNews Hour.\u201d \u201cBut this latest tweet is so typical of him. Nothing has been more examined and looked at than my emails. We all know that. So he\u2019s either lying or delusional or both.\u201d\n\nThen she said, \u201cMaybe there does need to be a rematch.\n\n\u201cObviously, I can beat him again. But, just seriously, I don\u2019t understand, I don\u2019t think anybody understands what motivates him other than personal grievance, other than seeking adulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeat him again\u201d?\n\nSome think Mrs. Clinton is getting ready to jump into the race. Former White House aide Steve Bannon has predicted she will make a third attempt for the presidency in 2020. \u201cHillary Clinton is doing a whole thing,\u201d he said on Fox Business. \u201cShe is running. She\u2019s just throwing to decide how to fit her way in.\u201d\n\nBNL News said last week that Hillary is \u201cthinking about\u201d entering the race. \u201cBREAKING: Hillary Clinton \u2018thinking about\u2019 running for President in 2020, according to multiple sources,\u201d the site wrote on Twitter.\n\nRasmussen Reports also reported that Mrs. Clinton performs well in an imaginary race against Mr. Trump, each garnering 45% with 11% undecided. \u201cIn a repeat matchup of the 2016 election, Clinton runs dead even with President Trump, but even most Democrats don\u2019t want her to get into the race,\u201d the polling site wrote.\n\nStill, the news wasn\u2019t all good for Hillary. \u201cJust 18% think Clinton should enter the race for next year\u2019s Democratic presidential nomination. Seventy-one percent (71%) don\u2019t think she should run,\u201d Rasmussen wrote.\n\nBut in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s delusional world, she\u2019s already beaten Mr. Trump once.\n\nLet\u2019s hope she tries to beat him again.\n\n\u2981 Joseph Curl covered the White House and politics for a decade for The Washington Times.
