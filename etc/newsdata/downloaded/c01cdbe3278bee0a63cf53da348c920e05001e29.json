Think again", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Trump and impeachment: Can President Trump block witnesses and subpoenas, and what can Congress do about it? Lawyer and author David Stewart explains. Hannah Gaber, USA TODAY\n\nIf you tuned in for the first five nights of the Democratic presidential debates, you might think \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and providing universal care are the only health care ideas Democrats have.\n\nWith less than four months to go before the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, proposals on issues like the opioid epidemic have attracted less attention.\n\nThat is because big-ticket policy ideas \u2013 like enrolling all U.S. residents into a Medicare-style program and eliminating private insurance \u2013 can help candidates stand out in the eyes of voters during a primary, said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University and director of the Harvard Opinion Research Program.\n\nBut Blendon said he has not seen polling suggesting voters have an appetite for another major health care debate. Voters are more concerned with how much they have to pay for medical care, like prescription drugs \u2013 \u201cvery practical, pocketbook issues,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s just my belief that whoever wins is going to have to switch back to pocketbook issues,\u201d Blendon said of the eventual Democratic nominee.\n\nThe next Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 15 will give 12 of the candidates a fresh chance to talk about their ideas beyond sprawling health care reform. Let us walk you through a few proposals they have championed, plus what President Donald Trump is offering.\n\nTrump, AOC and McConnell: The personalities that could determine who wins the Senate in 2020\n\nSanders\u2019 plan to cancel medical debt\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont rolled out a sweeping proposal last month to overhaul medical debt collection with a headline-catching promise: to wipe clean the roughly $81 billion Americans owe in past-due medical debt.\n\nAnd the issue is ubiquitous since polls show voters are deeply concerned about their out-of-pocket costs. Raymond Kluender, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School who researches medical debt, said about 20% of households have medical bills in collections.\n\nKluender said Sanders\u2019 plan targets debt that is rarely repaid anyway, noting that only about 8% of what is sent to collection agencies is ever repaid. Although some limited research suggests debt forgiveness may have mental health benefits, Kluender said, the effect Sanders\u2019 move would have \u201cis hard to know.\u201d\n\nHere are highlights of Sanders\u2019 proposal:\n\nEmpower the federal government to negotiate, then pay off past-due medical bills that have been reported to the credit agencies. To calculate how much that debt is, the Sanders campaign points to a 2018 study that showed 1 in every 6 Americans has a past-due medical bill on their credit report, with debt totaling about $81 billion.\n\nCurb \u201cabusive and harassing\u201d debt collection tactics, including enforcing statutes of limitation that generally run from three to six years, depending on the state; limiting how often debt collectors can contact those who owe; requiring debt collectors to verify whether the information they have is accurate before attempting to collect; restricting the seizures of assets and garnishing of wages.\n\nTask the Internal Revenue Service with examining nonprofit hospitals to ensure they meet the \u201ccharitable care standards\u201d for facilities with nonprofit tax status.\n\nReform the bankruptcy court system to help those in debt.\n\nJoe Biden: 'No one in my family will have an office in the White House' if I'm president\n\nBiden\u2019s plan to curb gun violence\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden announced a plan this month to reduce gun violence, an issue that has become a must for most Democratic voters.\n\nIn addition to outlining his proposal to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and require universal background checks, Biden took the opportunity to talk about his legislative history on guns: In 1993, he helped pass the law that established the background check system, and in 1994, he helped secure the 10-year assault weapons ban that has since lapsed.\n\nHe also drew attention to his newer ideas to change the system, including a push toward transitioning to \u201csmart guns.\u201d\n\nBut Biden\u2019s plan does not go as far as that of some of his opponents \u2013 including Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), who would require a license to own a firearm.\n\nHere is what Biden has said he would do on gun control:\n\nBan the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and otherwise regulate and buy back existing weapons.\n\nRequire background checks for all sales, and close certain loopholes, including those that allow people with mental health issues and hate crime convictions to have firearms.\n\nReward states that set up firearm licensing programs, require owners to safely store their weapons, and crack down on \u201cstraw purchasers\u201d who buy firearms for those who cannot pass a background check.\n\nCalifornia: First state to ban fur production and sales; animals also barred from circuses\n\nButtigieg\u2019s plan to strengthen mental health care\n\nMayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., introduced a wide-ranging, $300 billion proposal in August to improve treatment for mental health and substance abuse.\n\nFew disagree on the need to increase access to mental health care in the United States, making the issue one that is unlikely to move voters on its own, Blendon said. But Buttigieg\u2019s plan stands out for tripling the investments proposed by other Democratic candidates, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nTrue to his mayoral roots, Buttigieg adopts a locally driven approach. Among other strategies in his 19-page plan, he would give communities \u201cmost affected\u201d by mental illness and addiction $10 billion annually for 10 years to address prevention and care.\n\nHis campaign claims the plan would enable about 10 million more people to access care over the first four years of the program. Here are some ways Buttigieg said he would do that:\n\nEnforce mental health parity in coverage, including under Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nExpand access to addiction treatments, including by deregulating buprenorphine, a medication-assisted treatment proven effective for opioid use disorder.\n\nReduce related incarceration, in part by decriminalizing all drug possession and expunging past convictions.\n\nHold drug companies \u201caccountable\u201d for their role in the opioid epidemic, including by supporting state-level lawsuits.\n\n\u201cCombat the epidemic of social isolation and loneliness,\u201d including through a national service program that would pair older and younger Americans.\n\nElizabeth Warren targets Facebook fact-checking policy: False ad said Zuckerberg endorsed Trump\n\nWarren\u2019s plan to end the opioid crisis\n\nWarren unveiled an aggressive plan to combat the nationwide opioid epidemic last spring, proposing to spread $100 billion across the country to help state, local and tribal governments respond to the crisis.\n\nAnd unlike Buttigieg and his $300 billion mental health and addiction plan, Warren outlined how she would pay for it \u2013 with a tax on the richest 75,000 families.\n\n\u201cThis crisis has been driven by greed, pure and simple,\u201d she wrote in a Medium post detailing her plan.\n\nHere is some of what her plan would do:\n\nPrioritize and allocate money for public health departments, first responders and others in \u201cfront-line\u201d communities.\n\nGive states incentives to cover addiction services through state Medicaid programs.\n\nExpand surveillance, research and access to treatment, including naloxone, the overdose reversal drug.\n\nTrump\u2019s efforts on medicare, public health and drug prices\n\nPresident Donald Trump caused a stir this year when he declared the Republican Party would become \u201cthe party of health care\u201d and suggested he was working on another proposal to replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut he has said little on the subject since then, and a Washington Post report last month said the White House has abandoned that effort in favor of damage\n\ncontrol should the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals strike down the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has picked up on a series of often disparate health issues, including changes to how the government pays for care, investments in public health crises and steps intended to pressure drugmakers to lower prices.\n\nOne of his latest moves came on Oct. 3, when Trump signed an executive order making a variety of changes to Medicare, including expanding the private Medicare Advantage plans available to seniors and changing the enrollment process. He took the opportunity to pan the progressive push toward a single-payer health care system as \u201csocialist,\u201d framing his changes as protections for seniors.\n\nIn addition to an ambitious plan to end HIV/AIDS introduced in February, the Trump administration unveiled a kidney care initiative in July that adjusts payment incentives to encourage preventive care, home dialysis and transplants. And last month, the administration said it was preparing to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes amid a public health scare over vaping and concerns about widespread use among teens.\n\nAnd after promising to lower drug prices, Trump has struggled to make changes amid disagreements with the pharmaceutical industry and even fellow Republicans.\n\nThe administration has tasked the Department of Health and Human Services to work on other policies, including requiring hospitals to disclose prices and laying out a framework to allow, for the first time, the legal importation of prescription drugs from overseas.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.
