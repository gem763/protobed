California\n\nWith the Los Angeles press conference done, KSI has confirmed the team that will prepare him for his debut in the pro ranks.\n\nHis cutman will be Stitch Duran, the man who has worked alongside the likes of Andre Ward, Wladimir Klitschko and Amir Khan. He has also worked in mixed martial arts with UFC greats Anderson Silva and Georges St-Pierre. His biggest accomplishment, however, might be that he has been in three Rocky movies.\n\nActing as trainer will be Leon Wills, who is set to be in charge of the fitness side of things.\n\nHead coach is Viddal Riley, who has formed a strong relationship with KSI and acted as his main trainer in his previous two amateur bouts. Riley is also an undefeated cruiserweight professional, with a 2-0 record.\n\nJeff Mayweather will be working as team advisor, and he provides bags of experience. Having worked alongside his nephew Floyd Mayweather for many years, the help he will be able to provide could be invaluable.\n\nLarry Wade is strength and conditioning coach and works alongside KSI for the first time. He trains world champions Shawn Porter and Caleb Plant, while also working with Badou Jack and Joe Joyce. Another stellar addition to the team.\n\nFinally, Amer Abdallah, a kickboxing champion, will run the US camp. KSI is set to train half his camp in the UK and the rest in the US,\n\nA seven man team including the fighter himself, KSI has added years of experience to give himself every chance of victory against Paul.", "description": "KSI is set to make his professional debut on 9 November against Logan Paul, and the British fighter has revealed his training team.
