The north London club are now without a win in their last four games on the road.\n\nEvra hopes supporters are patient with summer signing Pepe (Picture: Sky Sports)\n\nSpeaking ahead of the match, Manchester United legend Evra pleaded with Arsenal fans to be patient with Pepe as he adapts to English football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also urged Pepe to give himself the best possible chance of succeeding in the Premier League by transforming his physique.\n\n\u2018I think the big price tag doesn\u2019t help, big pressure,\u2019 Evra said on Sky Sports\u2019 Monday Night Football.\n\n\u2018Some fans don\u2019t understand. It doesn\u2019t mean if you\u2019re bought for \u00a370-100million that you will score 30 goals.\n\nMousset scored the only goal of the game at Bramall Lane (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018[Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang did but he played for many years and scored many goals so you have to give time to Pepe. I believe in this player.\n\n\u2018I think he just needs to realise that the Premier League is completely different to the French league.\n\n\u2018You should be stronger so maybe he should go in the gym and build a massive body and you will see because he is talented.\n\n\u2018The problem is that he\u2019s under pressure. I want to see if now mentally he will be strong enough.\u2019\n\nEvra revealed that even Paul Scholes questioned his credentials when he first arrived at Old Trafford, but he managed to prove his doubters wrong through hard work.\n\n\u2018I came to Manchester and in my first six months even Scholesy says he thinks I was a joker and we should sell him back to Monaco!\u2019 Evra said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018But those things help me, they make me stronger. When me and [Nemanja] Vidic were substituted in a reserve game, some people were saying we were poor.\n\n\u2018After that we proved them wrong. Why? Because I worked hard in the summer and became the player I was.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUnai Emery admitted Pepe\u2019s missed chance was a \u2018key\u2019 moment in Arsenal\u2019s defeat at Bramall Park.\n\n\u2018The chance for us, for Pepe, was the key because if they score the first goal, defensively they are a very strong team,\u2019 the Spaniard said.\n\n\u2018Pepe is improving but the next step for him is to score.\n\n\u2018Usually he is going to score chances like that \u2013 but tonight he didn\u2019t take his chance.\u2019\n\nEmery insists Pepe is \u2018improving\u2019 after a slow start at Arsenal (Picture: Getty)\n\nEmery added: \u2018We had more possession, more chances, more shots and for example, Pepe is improving and I think Pepe\u2019s way with us is little-by-little getting better.\n\n\u2018The next step is to score. Tonight for example, the best chance is one he is usually going to score but tonight he didn\u2019t take that with efficiency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He also had two shots that were very important. I think he is improving and taking confidence with us. But it is one process.\u2019\n\nMORE: Real Madrid want \u00a330m for Dani Ceballos after Arsenal propose \u00a326m transfer", "description": "Patrice Evra has told Arsenal new boy Nicolas Pepe to 'build a massive body' in the gym in order to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League.
