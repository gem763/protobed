In the interview, he said performing on stage \u201cjust never gets old.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never go on stage late,\u201d he said. \u201cI just love to get out there and I\u2019m raring to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when I was doing a lot of drugs, I still carried on playing music,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s been my touchstone of my whole life.\u201d\n\nA highlight, John said, came in 1975 when John Lennon joined him to perform three songs at Madison Square Garden. It was Lennon\u2019s first appearance on stage in New York since the Beatles played Shea Stadium.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Elton John performs on stage during Montreux Jazz Festival, as part of his \"Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour\", Switzerland June 29, 2019. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nLennon was so nervous that he vomited before the performance, John said. \u201cHe came out to probably the most touching ovation I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d John said. \u201cWe all shed a tear on stage.\u201d\n\nJohn said he is not sure what his future holds but he is still writing songs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next and I don\u2019t want to know what\u2019s next,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just ready for the next chapter.\u201d", "description": "When Elton John was working on his new autobiography, the legendary singer, songwriter and performer pulled out diaries he had been encouraged to write during a stint in rehab.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442450408&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H22R", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
