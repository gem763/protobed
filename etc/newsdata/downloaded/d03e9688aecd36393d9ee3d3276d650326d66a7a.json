(Jeff Roberson/AP)\n\nBaseball games can be a magnet for lightning, as they\u2019re played outside under tall metal towers during storm-prone months, but the Cincinnati Reds believe they may have found a way to ward off dangerous bolts.\n\nA lightning-suppression system \u2014 purporting to balance the electric field between the clouds and ground \u2014 was installed at Great American Ball Park in early May; since then, a team official said, the stadium has escaped being struck despite a summer\u2019s worth of thunderstorms.\n\nThe Reds are piloting the system for Major League Baseball, so if the CMCE120 Lightning Suppressors \u2014 flattened aluminum globes about the width of the bases on the diamond \u2014 mounted atop the ballpark\u2019s light poles keep working as advertised, they may be coming soon to a stadium near you.\n\n\u201cOur number one responsibility is the safety of people in this ballpark,\u201d said Reds vice president of ballpark operations Tim O\u2019Connell, \u201cand if we can have another tool to make this a safer place to be, I\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nStill, the Reds have left in place the lightning rods studding GABP as well as a lightning-detection system. O\u2019Connell said the stadium, in an average season, has about a dozen games during which threatening lightning prompts the team to order fans out of exposed seats.\n\nThe lightning at Great American Ball Park was captured by a viewer.

The suggestion that a small object on a pole could possibly possess powers to attract or repel lightning over an appreciable distance is simply not rooted in established physical facts,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, education coordinator with the Lightning Safety Alliance. \u201cPromising protection for people in open areas during storm conditions is irresponsible, especially in the case of a sports stadium where tens of thousands of people are potentially exposed to lightning strike risk.\n\n\u201cRelying on unproven gimmicks to protect people in a stadium is an invitation for a lightning tragedy.\u201d\n\n\n\nA bolt of lightning strikes beyond the centerfield wall at Nationals Park. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nAlso skeptical is one of MLB\u2019s top stars.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible,\u201d said Los Angeles Angels center fielder Mike Trout, a self-professed weather geek, when told of Cincinnati\u2019s lightning suppressors.\n\nPossible or not, the Reds say the system at GABP is working.\n\nO\u2019Connell said he learned of the suppressors two years ago through a professional connection, then performed his due diligence by asking the team\u2019s meteorological advisers \u2014 and an MLB team can have many \u2014 whether such a thing was possible.\n\nAs O\u2019Connell remembered, \u201cTheir response, frankly, was, \u2018We\u2019d love to see it work.\u2019 \u201d\n\nO\u2019Connell also spoke with clients of EMP Solutions including sailboat owners and parks districts, and he did not receive any negative reviews.\n\nLightning strikes during the 7th inning of tonight's Rockies-Padres game in Denver - @AP photo pic.twitter.com/jqj10ZHCJx \u2014 BuzzFeed Storm (@BuzzFeedStorm) July 8, 2014\n\nWhen Capital Weather Gang did its own investigating, reaching out to companies and government agencies listed as customers in EMP Solutions documents or news articles, it, too, found customers who raved about the suppressors \u2014 including one client that really knows about thunderstorms.\n\nThe National Weather Service\u2019s office in Amarillo, Tex., had lost $157,000 worth of electronics to damage caused by lightning bolts in the year before buying a suppressor. After its installation on a tower by the office, no strikes.\n\n\u201cWe approve of it,\u201d said David Wilburn, electronic systems analyst at the Amarillo office.\n\nLike the Reds and MLB, Amarillo is piloting the system for the other forecast offices in the National Weather Service\u2019s Southern Region.\n\nOther entities to speak positively about EMS Solutions\u2019 products:\n\nThe city of Deerfield Beach, Fla., which installed a suppressor to protect the popular \u201cfish cam\u201d underneath its pier. Said city manager David Santucci: \u201cConsidering what we\u2019ve probably spent on fixing the camera and the electrical boxes, we\u2019ve made our money already because we spent less than $30,000 on the system.\u201d\n\nSarasota County, Fla., which wanted protection for its Emergency Operations Center. \u201cSarasota County is happy to report that our units have been installed for two years and have not had any direct lightning strikes,\u201d said Bill Rhodes, technology systems manager for the county\u2019s public safety communications. \u201cPrior to installation, our tower was struck twice in a one-year period.\u201d\n\nHancock County, Ind., which suffered two strikes to its 911 call center within a five-minute span in August 2016. \u201cWe have made it through 2017, 2018, and half of 2019 with no strikes, and we have had several strong storms pass through our area during that time,\u201d said John M. Jokantas, director of Hancock County 911.\n\nNational Oilwell Varco, which said it hasn\u2019t had any strikes in three years since installation at its R&D facility in Navasota, Tex.\n\nHowever, the endorsements certainly were not unanimous. Capital Weather Gang was given no comment by:\n\nNortheast Florida Regional Airport, in St. Augustine.\n\nThe U.S. Tennis Association, which has suppressors installed at its campus in Orlando.\n\nFirst Energy, for which EMP Solutions says it is protecting 22 communications towers for the utility in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n\nOne critic of EMP Solutions\u2019 technology says the absence of such suppressors at space-launch complexes in lightning-prone Florida provides evidence these devices do not work.\n\n\u201cNot just NASA, but any commercial launch provider, whether it is Space X or Blue Origin or Boeing or ULA or you name it \u2026 none of these gadgets are used at their launchpads \u2014 not a single one,\u201d said Carlos Mata, chief technologist for Scientific Lightning Solutions and a former technical lead of Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Advanced Electronics and Technology Development Laboratory.\n\nAlso, Mata added, there are myriad capacitors in use across the world, and no one believes those are preventing lightning strikes.\n\nKothari, in response, said he believes the critics are wrong \u2014 but he gets where they\u2019re coming from.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disruptive technology,\u201d Kothari said. \u201cIf everybody understood what this did and what it could do for them and the benefits of this over regular lightning protection, it would put the lightning rod people out of business.\u201d\n\nCorrection: The original version of this article named the Deerfield Beach, Fla. city manager as Dave Hall.
