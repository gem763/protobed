It set off a firestorm of ridicule and questions about the pitcher\u2019s heart and competitive spirit \u2014 already in doubt since the shutdown.\n\nStrasburg recognized what was at stake, for him as well as his team. He walked into manager Dusty Baker\u2019s office the next morning and said, \u201cI want the ball.\u201d\n\nThen he went out and pitched seven shutout innings, giving up just three hits, and struck out a franchise postseason record 12 batters, leading Washington to a 5-0 win and tying the series. The Nationals would go on to lose Game 5 and the series, but Strasburg had won the hearts and minds of some of his critics with his performance.\n\nNow, in these 2019 playoffs, he may have won over all of them.\n\nYou could make the case now that Strasburg \u2014 once vilified for not pitching in the playoffs \u2014 is putting together a record that ranks him among the premier postseason pitchers in the game.\n\nIn five postseason appearances, Strasburg has posted an 0.64 ERA.\n\nThat\u2019s the third lowest ERA ever through five career postseason games \u2014 minimum 20 innings pitched, behind Hall of Famers Waite Hoyt from 1921-1922 (0.26 ERA) and Christy Mathewson from 1905-1911 (0.38 ERA).\n\nStrasburg was asked about the arc of his career before his start Friday night.\n\n\u201cYou have ups and downs and I think you learn to manage them a little bit better,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cJust realize that at the end of the day when it\u2019s all done, how do you want to look back on it. And really, it\u2019s going out there and doing everything you can to be the best version of yourself.\u201d\n\nThis is the best version of Stephen Strasburg. It is what everyone has been waiting for.\n\n\u2981 Hear Thom Loverro on 106.7 The Fan Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings and on the Kevin Sheehan Show podcast.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
