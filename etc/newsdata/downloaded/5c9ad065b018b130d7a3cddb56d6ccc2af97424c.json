Yet it is so.\n\nSir Richard Dearlove, a former chief of MI6, today goes public to say that Seumas Milne \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest courtier and confidant \u2013 stands \u2018no chance\u2019 of passing Whitehall\u2019s stringent checks.\n\nThis has devastating consequences. If Mr Corbyn came to office and insisted on keeping Mr Milne at his side, he could trigger resignations at high levels in the security services, and cut Britain off from key allies.\n\nMr Milne, pictured above with Jeremy Corbyn, is not some naive patsy. He is a serious operator. He knows what he is doing when he sympathises with Middle Eastern terror groups and when he hobnobs with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime\n\nSir Richard gave his warning in response to The Mail on Sunday\u2019s worrying revelations about Mr Milne, which come hard on the heels of our dramatic and disturbing disclosures about Mr Corbyn himself.\n\nUnlike his bumbling and poorly informed chief, Mr Milne comes from Britain\u2019s elite class and is a highly educated and very intelligent man.\n\nThis is what makes his extraordinary career and his unconventional political positions so important.\n\nMr Milne is not some naive patsy. He is a serious operator. He knows what he is doing when he sympathises with Middle Eastern terror groups and when he hobnobs with Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nIf Mr Corbyn came to office and insisted on keeping Mr Milne (above) at his side, he could trigger resignations at high levels in the security services, and cut Britain off from key allies\n\nHis lifelong, highly selective hostility to the state of Israel is a long-standing feature of the intellectual hard Left to which he belongs. But it helps to sustain the increasing isolation of, and mistreatment of, individual Jews in the Corbyn Labour Party.\n\nSo-called anti-Zionism may claim to be free of any kind of bigotry, but it provides a political figleaf for what is in many cases a racist hostility to Jews themselves. Mr Corbyn asserts that he opposes this, yet it still flourishes in the ranks of his party.\n\nThe most powerful evidence of this is the growing difficulty faced by Jewish Labour MPs, attacked simply for being themselves. Last week, Luciana Berger decided she could take no more of it. Now her colleague, Dame Louise Ellman, stands on the very brink of a similar breach after suffering years of harassment.\n\nIt is hard to predict the effect that such defections will have on the future of British politics.\n\nAnd even these latest events may not be enough to bring the Labour Party to its senses. Its current constitution has put it in the hands of militants.\n\nBut they really ought to be enough to persuade voters to ensure that Mr Corbyn does not under any circumstances become Prime Minister, let alone bring Seumas Milne in to Downing Street at his side.\n\nJeremy Corbyn may need Seumas Milne. Britain needs neither of them.\n\nSoldiers\u2019 helpline proving its worth\n\nIt is now a year since The Mail on Sunday won its campaign for a 24-hour helpline for troops suffering from combat stress.\n\nThe fact that it has received 1,700 calls in its first 12 months shows that there is no doubt that it was needed.\n\nThe lasting effects of battle may be invisible to the rest of us living our peaceful lives, but can go very deep indeed.\n\nThe continuing scale of the problem is worryingly illustrated by the story we publish today about Britain\u2019s first homeless policeman, a former soldier plagued with flashbacks, who has served his country both as a fighting man and as a guardian of the peace. We owe so much to such men and women.\n\nWe must not let any of them slip through the safety net.", "description": "MAIL ON SUNDAY COMMENT: Former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove, today goes public to say Seumas Milne \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s closest courtier\u2013 stands \u2018no chance\u2019 of passing Whitehall checks.", "authors": ["Mail On Sunday Comment For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/02/24/00/10195882-0-image-a-25_1550968376530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-02-24"}
