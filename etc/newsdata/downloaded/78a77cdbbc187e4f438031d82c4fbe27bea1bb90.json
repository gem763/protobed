The full scope of the disaster won't be known until the storm passes.\n\n\"We are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our country's history,\" he said. \"No effort or resources will be held back.\"\n\nHe said he flew over the Abaco Islands and expected to do the same in Grand Bahama when the weather permitted him to do so. Dorian, which was later downgraded to a Category 2 storm, was the most powerful ever to hit the Bahamas, with floodwaters destroying thousands of homes, trapping people and making resue efforts all the more difficult.\n\nAround 45 percent of homes in Abaco and Grand Bahama were believed to be damaged or destroyed when the areas were pounded by 185 mph winds. The Grand Bahama Airport was under six feet of water as of Tuesday.\n\nImages revealed the scope of damage as buildings were flooded and at least one community was destroyed.\n\nUsing jet skis, boats and even a bulldozer, people in Grand Bahama were evacuated by rescue crews in the midst of heavy rain and wind.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard rescued at least 21 people injured at Abaco.\n\n\"We will confirm what the real situation is on the ground,\" Health Minister Duane Sands said. \"We are hoping and praying that the loss of life is limited.\"\n\nTRACKING THE STORM\n\nAs of 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, the storm was moving northwest toward the United States at about 7 mph. The storm was about 140 miles off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Fla., with winds at a still-dangerous 110 mph.\n\nOfficials urged over two million people in Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina to evacuate. Dorian is expected to pass close to Georgia and South Carolina on Thursday or Friday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSevere flooding is expected to occur even if the storm doesn't make landfall.\n\n\"Don't tough it out.
