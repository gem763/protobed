They should follow government instructions and finish evacuating or traveling early. If they leave too late, they shouldn't go outside, but just stay on the upper floors of a building,\" Hirose said.\n\nThe Fukushima prefectural government said a 61-year-old mother was found dead and her 38-year-old son went missing in the city of Soma after their light vehicle was apparently swept away by flood water.\n\nIn Nagara, Chiba Prefecture, 88-year-old Choju Iwase was found inside a submerged vehicle after telling his son by phone that he was trapped inside. Iwase was planning to take shelter at his son's home located on a hill, according to the Chiba government.\n\nPostman Naruo Tsuruoka, 54, in the same town died after his vehicle was swept off a bridge as he was on his way to pick up his 6-year-old son.\n\nChiba Prefecture's evacuation guidelines for tsunami say water as deep as 50 centimeters can trap a person inside a vehicle, cause the vehicle float and put it at a risk of being swept away.\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency urges people not to travel by vehicle when rainfall exceeds 50 millimeters per hour.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Many of the deaths from recent powerful typhoons in Japan occurred while victims were traveling in vehicles, local authorities said Monday, underscoring the need for people to evacuate early and reach safety in plenty of time.
