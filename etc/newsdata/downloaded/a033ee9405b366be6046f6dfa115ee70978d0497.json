It was an approach to photography, art and cultural criticism that was both proudly American and distinctively Jewish \u2014 to embrace a new homeland by becoming one of its fiercest critics .\n\nMr. Frank, who died on Monday at the age of 94, came to the United States as an artist and a refugee. Born to a Jewish family in Zurich in 1924, he was 9 years old when the Nazis came to power in Germany. Even in neutral Switzerland, his family was aware that their safety was precarious. A budding artistic talent, Mr. Frank was drawn to the freedom and creative promise of America.\n\nWhen he arrived in New York in 1947, the country was basking in its postwar triumph and prosperity, convinced of the need to spread its liberal ideas worldwide. Mr. Frank came prepared both to embrace and to challenge the values of his new homeland.\n\n\u201cI looked at poor people, how they tried to survive, what a lonely time it can be in America, and what a tough country it is,\u201d Mr. Frank said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t make me hate America; it made me understand how people can be.\"", "description": "The photographer brought an unflinchingly American \u2014 and uniquely Jewish \u2014 approach to his art.", "authors": ["Emma Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/opinion/10robertfrankEd/10robertfrankEd-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
