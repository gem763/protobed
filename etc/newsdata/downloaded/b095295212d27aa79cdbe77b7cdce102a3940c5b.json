If the right services are not in place, these often-vulnerable people are being set up to fail.\u201d\n\nWhen young offenders turn 18, inspectors found they fell over a \u201ccliff-edge\u201d of support when transferred to the adult probation service.\n\nOne example given was a boy who turned 18 while in custody for a sexual offence, and did not undertake any work to address his offending, then was sent back to his old address despite asking to be moved to a new area.\n\nA month after release, he was arrested for a new sexual offence and was recalled to prison.\n\nMr Russell said the children jailed in England and Wales are getting older on average, and the offences concerned are more severe.\n\n\u201cThere are fewer going in for theft of a motor vehicle or the sort of stuff young people used to be in there for,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are much more likely to be in there for sex offences and violence.\u201d\n\nIn 2017-2018, and the average sentence was 16.7 months and almost 80 per cent of children and young people in custody committed violent offences, robbery, burglary and sexual offences.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice said an internal review of preparations for release is ongoing, and officials were drawing up new policies for offenders transitioning from youth to adult custody.\n\n\u201cStrong resettlement support both inside and outside prison is a vital pillar of rehabilitation,\u201d a spokesperson added. \u201cWe must improve standards so they are consistent and enable young offenders to move away from crime for good. That is why we are reviewing resettlement services at all young offenders institutions and are working closely with external agencies which provide accommodation, education, training and employment to improve support on release.\u201d", "description": "Children\u00a0jailed for criminal offences are being \u201cset up to fail\u201d by authorities who fail to give them the support they need\u00a0to stop offending, a watchdog has found.
