There, they will begin work on a constitutional committee intended to shift attention from the battlefield to what happens when, sooner or later, the fighting in their country stops.\n\nMr. Pedersen\u2019s immediate goals are modest. He does not expect to achieve a peace, he said in an interview, but reforming Syria\u2019s Constitution, could serve as \u201ca door opener to a political process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all understand that the constitutional committee itself will not bring a solution to the conflict,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Geneva talks are meant to be a first step under a United Nations Security Council mandate that calls for a nationwide cease-fire and elections under United Nations supervision.\n\nA senior State Department official said Monday that the United States and other nations had several points of leverage to try to get Mr. Assad to work on a political settlement. The official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity, said that could include keeping reconstruction assistance from Mr. Assad\u2019s government, barring Syria\u2019s re-entry into the Arab League and refusing to restore diplomatic ties with Damascus.", "description": "A United States pullout, a Turkish invasion and a newly strengthened Syrian leader have reshaped the board for negotiations in Geneva.", "authors": ["Nick Cumming-Bruce", "Lara Jakes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/world/28syria-peace1a/28syria-peace1a-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
