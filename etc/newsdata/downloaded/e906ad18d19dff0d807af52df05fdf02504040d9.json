Sidewalk will use this proliferation of devices to build a \"mesh network\" \u2014 a wireless network where each device communicates with one another, working together to transmit data across the network \u2014 that spans broad geographical areas. According to Amazon's announcement, the company found that placing 700 devices across Los Angeles was enough to cover the entire metropolitan area of the city.\n\nNow, privacy watchdogs are sounding alarm bells about what that means for the company's ability to surveil individuals.\n\nTech activist Liz O'Sullivan flagged the mesh network's potential for surveillance during the Amazon hardware event and tweeted about it Thursday.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the new Amazon update and what it could mean for your privacy.\n\nAmazon's mesh network could help the tech giant monitor your phone's location\n\nEven if you don't use Amazon's wireless networks in your own home \u2014 or join its WiFi networks when you go out \u2014 the mesh network could enable Amazon to get data about the location of your devices.\n\nOwners of WiFi networks can track what devices are nearby even if those devices don't sign onto the network, just like a smartphone can detect nearby networks without signing on.\n\nIf you're in range of a wireless network owned by Amazon, the company could receive information like your device's MAC address, a unique identifier assigned to each device. If you've used that device to download an Amazon app or log into your Amazon account, the company could pair that MAC address with your user profile.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nThe technology that allows owners of WiFi routers to track nearby devices is nothing new. But it's unusual for companies to build such sprawling mesh networks using devices that users set up in their own homes.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon is a company with a demonstrated interest in tracking users' data and location. Geographic data is an important tool for building user profiles and targeting advertisements accordingly, a growing business for almost all big tech companies.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon has multiple contracts with police, turning over insights from its network of Ring cameras to as many as 200 police departments nationwide, according to a Motherboard report.\n\nFor the time being, many of the details surrounding how Sidewalk and eero networks will work remains unclear. Amazon has not specified what sort of data it will track with its new mesh networks, or whether that data will be up for grabs by the law enforcement agencies it partners with.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson did not respond to Business Insider's questions regarding how it will use geolocation data gleaned from its mesh network.", "description": "Even if you don\u2019t use Amazon\u2019s wireless networks in your own home, the mesh network could enable Amazon to get geolocation data from your devices.", "authors": ["Aaron Holmes"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8e65342e22af03e064ab9e-750-375.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
