A person familiar with the deal said the five-year agreement is worth close to $500 million. In addition, WarnerMedia\u2019s cable channel TBS has extended its current deal for reruns of the show, making the total value of the deal in the region of $600 million, another person with knowledge of the matter said. HBO Max\u2019s streaming rights is for U.S. rights only: Netflix Inc. has international rights to the show.\n\nThe sale of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d is the latest in a series of big deals for popular reruns as streaming services both existing and planned battle for classic content. Episodes of hit shows often retain their popularity years and decades after their initial run and are seen as must-have programming.\n\n\u201c \u201cThe fact that we get to bring it to a streaming platform for the first time in the U.S. is a coup for our new offering.\u201d \u201d \u2014Robert Greenblatt, WarnerMedia Entertainment\n\nOn Monday, Netflix struck a deal\u2014valued at more than $500 million, according to people familiar with the matter\u2014for global streaming rights to the 1990s NBC hit \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d That acquisition came after Netflix lost the streaming rights to two of its most popular classic shows, \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office.\u201d\n\nHBO Max acquired streaming rights to the show \u201cFriends\u201d for $425 million for five years starting in 2020, people with knowledge of the agreement said. A new streaming service being launched next spring by Comcast Corp.\u2019s NBCUniversal acquired streaming rights to \u201cThe Office\u201d for five years starting in 2021 in a pact valued at $500 million, people familiar with that deal said.\n\nWhile the value of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d sale is higher than the sale for \u201cFriends,\u201d its per-episode fee is slightly lower. There were 279 episodes of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d compared with 236 of \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nAs part of the sale, WarnerMedia\u2019s TBS Network, which currently airs reruns of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory,\u201d extended its deal for cable rights to the show through 2028. Under its current agreement, which runs to 2024, TBS is paying about $1.5 million an episode for the show.\n\nTBS was a major factor in determining how the sale of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d played out. The TBS contract for the show included a provision that it couldn\u2019t be sold to a streaming service without the network\u2019s blessing, people with knowledge of the matter said. Warner Bros., which handled the sale, didn\u2019t shop the show to other streaming services, a person close to the matter said.\n\nAlthough the deal was done in-house between two WarnerMedia units, both sides needed to make sure there was no \u201csweetheart\u201d deal or they would risk upsetting Chuck Lorre, the producer of the show and a hitmaker for the company for many years. His other credits include \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d \u201cYoung Sheldon\u201d and \u201cMom.\u201d\n\nPeople close to the producer said the feeling is that fair market value for the show was achieved given the challenges of the Turner provision.\n\nRobert Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment, called \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d one of the biggest shows on broadcast television of the last decade. He said, \u201cThe fact that we get to bring it to a streaming platform for the first time in the U.S. is a coup for our new offering.\u201d\n\nWrite to Joe Flint at joe.flint@wsj.com", "description": "HBO Max, the new direct-to-consumer streaming service AT&T\u2019s WarnerMedia is launching next spring, has struck a deal for streaming rights to reruns of the just-ended CBS comedy \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d", "authors": ["Joe Flint", "Joe.Flint Wsj.Com", "Robert Greenblatt", "Warnermedia Entertainment"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107721/social", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
