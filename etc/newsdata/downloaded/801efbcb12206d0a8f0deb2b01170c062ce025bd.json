Here we dive into the details of several notable injury updates and roster moves around the league.\n\nThree things that matter\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nTrent Williams does not pass physical with Redskins\n\nTrent Williams' return to the Redskins has hit a snag. One day after ESPN reported the offensive tackle would be ending his holdout that lasted to this year's trade deadline, Williams apparently had an issue with his helmet and failed his physical as a result.\n\nWilliams has had his issues with the Redskins this season already, as he was dissatisfied with how the team's medical staff handled a growth found on his head earlier in the offseason. That led to an eight-game holdout that ended on Tuesday. The Redskins then thought they would have their best tackle back, but apparently they will have to wait even longer.\n\nAfter missing the first eight games of the season, it seems unlikely he will make his 2019 debut on Sunday against the Bills.\n\nChristian McCaffrey limited at practice with knee injury\n\nThe Panthers' star running back has appeared on the team's injury report but coach Ron Rivera has clarified that the move is merely precautionary and that there is no concern that McCaffrey will miss Sunday's game against the Titans.\n\nMcCaffrey is coming off a big Week 8 performance, despite the loss to the 49ers, after carrying the ball 14 times for 117 yards and a touchdown while logging four catches for 38 yards.\n\nSeahawks place Tedric Thompson on IR\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was was reported that the 24-year-old starting safety will undergo surgery on a torn labrum, which is shocking considering he played every snap in the Seahawks' win over the Falcons on Sunday. Still, the team could get a boost elsewhere.\n\nCoach Pete Carroll has noted veteran tight end Ed Dickson has a chance to play on Sunday against the Buccaneers after spending the first eight weeks of the season on injured reserve with a knee injury.\n\nTwo things that don't matter\n\nAndy Dalton \"disagrees\" with Bengals benching\n\nVeteran quarterback Dalton was not happy with the team's decision to bench him for rookie Ryan Finley and voiced his frustrations after his agent was unable to find him a trade partner before Tuesday's deadline.\n\n\"I don\u2019t agree with the decision but I'm going do everything I can to help the team,\" Dalton told reporters. \"It happened three hours before the trade deadline. I wish they would have ... at least if he was thinking about it, at least try to let me see if I could end up somewhere or at least see if there was interest in possibly getting traded.\n\n\"At that point, the way it was all handled, there wasn't enough time to even have that happen.\"\n\nConsidering Dalton had previously started every Bengals game for which he was healthy since Week 1 of his rookie season in 2011, it could be argued he deserved better.\n\nDeshaun Watson will miss World Series pregame festivities\n\nThe Texans quarterback will not participate in the ceremonial \"Play Ball\" call before Game 7 of the World Series in Houston because of a \"minor setback\" with his injured left eye.\n\nWatson has been dealing with swelling and redness after getting kicked in the eye on Sunday against the Raiders. He was at practice on Wednesday as the team prepared for their Week 9 matchup with the Jaguars in London, but reports have suggested \"it was thought best he rest up rather than expose it to bright lights at game.\"\n\nOne video you have to see\n\nBaker Mayfield just couldn't stand hearing \"the dumbest question you could ask\" and exited his media availability on Wednesday.\n\nWednesday's tweet of the day\n\nNFL numbers appear to be thriving, despite questionable officiating and teams tanking.", "description": "Trent Williams did not pass a physical with the Washington Redskins, while Carolina Panthers RB Christian McCaffrey was limited at practice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/560jB_8smwSrnW2W.V1DDQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MIvdVN0U5D7cw_FOaW.Glg--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/3e1973b67cabb80eaa5903a2bd180a85", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
