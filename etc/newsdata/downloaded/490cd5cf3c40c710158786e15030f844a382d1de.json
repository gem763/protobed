One and a half years later, the show said goodbye this week after nine seasons on the air.\n\nThe nod to Meghan and Harry was brief but effective: As Louis (Rick Hoffman) is preparing for his wedding ceremony, his best friend Harvey (Gabriel Macht) does a double-take. \"Wait a second. Are you wearing a morning coat?\" he asks.\n\nAfter Louis responds affirmatively, Harvey replies, \"Louis, you're not the prince of England.\"\n\nRELATED: Behind-the-scenes snaps from Meghan Markle's \"Suits\" days\n\nAlthough some fans were holding out for an appearance from the duchess herself, most knew a cameo was unlikely. However, there were some flashback clips that showed several of her scenes from earlier seasons.\n\n\"Suits\" creator Aaron Korsh revealed that although it was tempting to approach Meghan about reprising her role in some fashion, he ultimately couldn't bring himself to do it.\n\n\"I thought about asking, and I thought about even using audio footage that we have to come up with something, and in the end, I didn\u2019t ask,\" he told Deadline. \"I just thought, I\u2019m going to respect her new life and not put her in the position of having to ask. We decided not to put her in that position so I never asked.\"\n\nKorsh did ask Patrick J. Adams, who left when Meghan did, if he would make a return \u2014 and Adams' willingness to participate ended up shaping the entire series finale: The story was \"highly contingent on it, but Patrick was on board pretty early.\"", "description": "Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, starred on 'Suits' from 2011 until 2018, when her final episode aired.", "authors": ["Jennifer Kline"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/gM_vxr.VcLYxFYpYIWIjGw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/ed62a8e0-e08c-11e9-b9ff-d6dbf0940000", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
