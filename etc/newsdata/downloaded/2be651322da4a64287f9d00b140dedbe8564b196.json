Is He Blind?", "language": "en", "text": "Chrissy Metz as Kate, Chris Sullivan as Toby. Photo: Ron Batzdorff/NBC\n\nSpoilers ahead for This Is Us season four.\n\nThis Is Us kicked off its fourth season with a giant leap into the far future, introducing us to Kate and Toby\u2019s adult son Jack Damon, a musician with a honey voice and an adorable white Pomeranian named Sam. Viewers watched Jack (played by musical theater actor Blake Stadnik) meet and fall in love with Lucy (Auden Thornton), a waitress aspiring to be a chef, before the episode revealed that he is actually Kate and Toby\u2019s baby boy, who was born prematurely at the end of the last season.\n\nIt was one of three new stories This Is Us introduced in \u201cStrangers,\u201d all of which will interconnect with the Pearson saga and have \u201cmassive impact\u201d on the family, creator Dan Fogelman said during a press call on Tuesday.\n\nIn the last minutes of the episode, Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Toby (Chris Sullivan) learn that three-month-old Jack was born with retinopathy and will only be able to see light and shapes. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a while now that Kate\u2019s son was going to be born prematurely and blindness retinopathy is a common thing that would come from that,\u201d Fogelman said.\n\nSo far, the show\u2019s furthest jump into the future followed the Big Three at middle age, dealing with their mother Rebecca\u2019s (Mandy Moore) deteriorating health. Baby Jack is about 12 years old in that timeline. The rest of that story will play out during the first half of the season, Fogelman said, making room for bigger leaps into the future for next season.\n\nJack\u2019s story shown in \u201cStrangers\u201d takes place about ten or more years after Rebecca\u2019s story ends, Fogelman said. At the end of the episode, he performs \u201cMemorized,\u201d an original song co-written by This Is Us Emmy-nominated composer Siddharta Khosla and Mandy Moore\u2019s husband Taylor Goldsmith, the lead singer of the rock band Dawes. \u201cCertainly music has always been a big part of this family\u2019s story generationally and obviously it continues on down the line,\u201d Fogelman said.\n\nAlthough the writers and producers plan to return to that distant timeline multiple times over the course of the series, it won\u2019t happen soon, Fogelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult period to go into all the time \u2018cause we\u2019re pretty deep into the future and it presents production challenges,\u201d Fogelman said. But producers \u201cfell so in love\u201d with Stadnik that sometimes \u201cparts get even bigger than what you were planning on making them,\u201d he added.\n\nThe show\u2019s casting department found Stadnik during a search for \u201ca leading man who was without sight and could be funny and charming but also accessible and sweet,\u201d Fogelman said. \u201cI was worried about it.\u201d To his surprise, they found several viable choices who could also sing, but once producers met Stadnik, \u201che was clearly the guy,\u201d even though he had never acted on camera.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to find an actor who could be a leading man and very handsome and very funny and look great with his bare ass on national television, but also be able to go stand in the Greek in front of a live audience and actually perform and sing a song,\u201d Fogelman said. \u201cBlake\u2019s first day of shooting was literally lying completely naked in a bed, and then having a six-hour makeout scene [with Thornton], and then going onto the stage at the Greek in front of thousands of people during an intermission of a concert to perform a song.\u201d The performance, during a Chicago concert, \u201cwas quite a trial by fire for him and he just blew us away in every way,\u201d Fogelman added.", "description": "This Is Us kicked off its fourth season with a giant leap into the far future, introducing us to Kate and Toby\u2019s adult son Jack Damon, a blind musician with a honey voice and an adorable white Pomeranian named Sam.
