An investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that Moscow interfered in the election to help Trump, but said there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy with Russia.\n\nAs part of his inquiry, Barr has asked Australian and British justice officials for assistance and visited Italy twice, meeting intelligence agents in Rome on Aug. 15 and Sept. 27 to learn more about people mentioned in Mueller's report.\n\nA central figure is Joseph Mifsud, a 59-year-old Maltese academic involved in law and diplomacy education programmes in London and Rome, who also had contacts with Russian officials and met with George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, on several occasions.\n\nFollowing are some key questions about Mifsud, an obscure professor who has not been seen in public for nearly two years and who remains a focus of attention in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY IS MIFSUD SO IMPORTANT?\n\nThe Mueller report describes a series of meetings between Mifsud, then a professor at the now-defunct London Academy of Diplomacy, and Papadopoulos in the spring of 2016.\n\nThey first met in mid-March at Link Campus, a private university in Rome to which Mifsud was affiliated. Papadopoulos, then 28, was visiting Link to meet officials as part of his role at the London Centre for International Law Practice, a quasi-think-tank based in London that he had recently joined and which Mifsud was also affiliated to.\n\nMueller's report says Mifsud, who was living in London at the time and had established a number of Russian contacts, became more interested in Papadopoulos after the American mentioned that he had been hired to join the Trump campaign as an adviser specialising in energy policy.\n\nOver the next month, Mifsud and Papadopoulos held a series of meetings and had regular phone and email contact, with Mifsud offering to introduce Papadopoulos to European leaders and officials with connections in the Russian government.\n\nThe critical meeting came on April 26, the day after Mifsud had returned to London following a 10-day visit to Moscow.\n\nAccording to the Mueller report, Mifsud told Papadopoulos he had met with high-level Russian government officials during his trip and learned that the Russians had obtained \"dirt\" on Trump's election rival Hillary Clinton in the form of \"thousands of emails\".\n\nThat would make him the original source of one of the key allegations against the Trump campaign investigated by Mueller.\n\nIn a meeting with a Western diplomat 10 days later, Papadopoulos suggested the Russian government could help the Trump campaign via the anonymous release of information that would be damaging to Clinton, the report says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE IS MIFSUD NOW?\n\nMifsud hasn't been seen in public since November 2017, when he was spotted at Link Campus and spoke briefly to a reporter from Italy's la Repubblica newspaper. In the interview he denied telling Papadopoulos anything about Russian \"dirt\" on Clinton and dismissed his Russian contacts as meaningless.\n\nAnother Italian newspaper, Il Foglio, reported in April that he was holed up in an apartment in Rome - equidistant between the U.S. and the Russian embassies - for seven months during 2017-2018, with the rent paid by Link. But the contract expired in July or August last year and he hasn't been seen since.\n\nThe same newspaper published a picture earlier this month of Mifsud sitting in his former lawyer's office in Zurich, holding a copy of the Zurichsee-Zeitung newspaper. Il Foglio said the photo was taken on May 21, 2018.\n\nThe lawyer, Stephan Roh, told Reuters he had not had any contact with Mifsud for a while, and said a London-based law firm was now representing him. That firm declined to comment.\n\nFormer associates of Mifsud's said they had had no contact with him since late 2017. His daughter is said to be still living in London, while his ex-wife lives in Malta.", "description": "In recent weeks, U.S. Attorney General William Barr, with backing from President Donald Trump, has stepped up an inquiry into the origins of an FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
