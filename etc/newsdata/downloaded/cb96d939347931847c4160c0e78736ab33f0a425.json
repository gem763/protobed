Every conversation we have is based on the long-term.'\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the Glazers is the debt saddled on United by their leveraged \u00a3780m buyout which currently stands at \u00a3511m.\n\nThe Americans have been unpopular among many fans since acquiring United in 2005\n\nBut in an interview with fanzine United We Stand, Woodward played down that figure, saying: 'The debt is a long-term, structured and similar to some other football clubs.\n\n'It's a fixed amount for a fixed period of time which results in it being fairly cheap to service.\n\n'It's just under two per cent our annual revenue each year, so it doesn't really have any impact on us.'\n\nOn the pitch, United have also drawn criticism from their fans, slumping to 14th in the Premier League, having failed to win in their last four games.\n\nThey travel to Norwich tomorrow as they seek to put their season right.", "description": "Discontent surrounding United's ownership by the American Glazer family has been apparent for years, paving the way for reports of a possible takeover by Mohammed Bin Salman.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/17/20220516-0-image-a-4_1572107411225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
