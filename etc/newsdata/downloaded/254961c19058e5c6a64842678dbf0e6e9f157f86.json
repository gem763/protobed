Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\nRomney, who was considered a potential contender for secretary of State after the 2016 election, has emerged as one of the few congressional Republicans to publicly criticize the White House over its Syria policy and Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine, which are at the heart of a House impeachment probe.\n\nThe Utah Republican excoriated the administration Thursday after Trump announced a five-day cease-fire between Turkey and Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.\n\n\"The announcement today is being portrayed as a victory. It is far from a victory. Serious questions remain about how the decision was reached precipitously to withdraw from Syria and why that decision was reached,\" Romney said. \"Adding insult to dishonor, the administration speaks cavalierly, even flippantly, even as our ally has suffered death and casualty.\"\n\nCritics of the deal have said the cease-fire essentially allowed Turkey to continue its offensive after five days while forcing U.S.-allied Kurds to retreat. Reports have already emerged of fighting near the Turkey-Syria border.\n\nRomney has also expressed unease with Trump\u2019s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he investigate former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTrump knocks Romney as 'Democrat secret asset' in new video Giuliani asked State Dept. to grant visa for ex-Ukraine official at center of Biden allegations: report Perry won't comply with subpoena in impeachment inquiry MORE on unfounded corruption allegations.\n\n\"I did read the transcript. It remains troubling in the extreme. It's deeply troubling,\" Romney told reporters last month, referring to a transcript of the July phone call between the two leaders. \"Clearly what we've seen from the transcript itself is deeply troubling.\"\n\nRomney has not garnered many GOP allies in his efforts on Capitol Hill but has earned the ire of Trump over the last several weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator, Mitt Romney, to be a big mistake.
