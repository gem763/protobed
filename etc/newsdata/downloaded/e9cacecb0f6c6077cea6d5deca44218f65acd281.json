It came not from her presidential campaign but from her Senate office, and it concerned a subject that doesn\u2019t often claim the attention of U.S. senators, much less leading contenders in a presidential race.\n\nThe subject was bond ratings.\n\n\u201cSenator Warren to SEC,\u201d read the headline. \u201cDo Your Job. Crack Down on Dangerous Inflated Bond Ratings.\u201d The press release was sparked by recent \u201ctroubling reports of inflated bond ratings and the perverse incentives within the bond rating industry.\u201d It pointed out that poorly-rated mortgage-backed securities caused \u201cmillions of Americans to lose their jobs, homes and savings\u201d during the financial crisis \u2014 yet a decade later \u201cratings agencies are continuing to rubber stamp risky products.\u201d\n\nThe press release linked to the letter Warren had sent to Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it was a doozy. Three and a half single-spaced pages, heavily footnoted, it offered a detailed analysis of the damage those triple A-rated subprime securities had done to the economy in 2008. And it reminded Clayton that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law had established an Office of Credit Ratings within the SEC that was charged with promoting accurate bond ratings. What, Warren asked Clayton, was the SEC doing about this growing problem?\n\nAs it happens, the day before Warren issued her press release, CNBC ran a story saying that big-money Democrats on Wall Street \u2013 that is, the people Democratic presidential nominees rely on every four years \u2014 were threatening to either sit out the 2020 race, or support Donald Trump, if Warren were the nominee. (Hillary Clinton received more than $64 million from the financial services industry in 2016.)\n\nOne anonymous Wall Street executive (shocker: nobody was willing to speak on the record to CNBC) said that he and his fellow Wall Street Democrats \u201cwill not support her. It would be like shutting down their industry.\u201d CNBC linked to a video of Jim Cramer, one of its in-house stars, saying bluntly: \u201cShe has to be stopped.\u201d\n\nAnd early last week, a strategist with AGF Investments put out a note to clients saying that \u201cinvestors should be more concerned\u201d about the prospect of a Warren presidency than about any \u201cfallout\u201d from Trump\u2019s phone call to the president of the Ukraine. After all, the strategist, Greg Valliere, told Bloomberg News, the Robert Mueller investigation hadn\u2019t affected markets, so the impeachment inquiry probably wouldn\u2019t either.\n\nAh, but Elizabeth Warren \u2014 she\u2019d be a disaster for stocks! After all, she wants to force private equity firms to take more responsibility for the workers whose companies they take over; to cancel student debt that is putting college graduates behind the eight-ball; to recreate the Glass-Steagall Act and once again separate investment and commercial banking; and to eliminate the \u201ctricks and traps\u201d that the financial services industry often uses to stick consumers with excessive fees. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget: Warren wants to impose a 2% tax on any household with a net worth over $50 million and a 3% tax on households worth over $1 billion. That\u2019s gotta be a stock market killer. Right?\n\nI understand that markets are central to Wall Street, but it\u2019s a bit much when it tends to view everything through the prism of stocks and bonds. If World War III were to break out, you half expect Wall Street strategists to react with notes asking \u201cWhat does it mean for the market?\u201d (Which they would, of course; that\u2019s a fundamental part of their job. I\u2019m simply asking that they take other forces into account as well.)In this case, what the anti-Warren Democrats are really saying is that they would prefer a president who has divided and destabilized the country \u2014 and whose phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president was so far outside the bounds that he is likely to be impeached \u2014 than a president who would prevent them from gouging customers and taxing some of their wealth. That\u2019s a pretty sorry commentary.\n\nWall Street often lumps Warren together with Senator Bernie Sanders as a \u201csocialist.\u201d She is nothing of the sort. As she consistently says, \u201cI believe in markets.\u201d She just wants them to work better. Her stance towards Wall Street reminds me of Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s, who came into office in 1933, with banks failing and the country struggling through the Depression. By the time he died in 1945, bank customers had federal deposit insurance, commercial banks and investment banks had been separated, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had been created to regulate the markets. These three measures did a great deal to restore Americans\u2019 faith in the nation\u2019s financial system. But of course Wall Street hated Roosevelt too.", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- A press release from Elizabeth Warren landed in my inbox last Friday morning.
