India has dismissed those concerns.\n\n\"The second informal meeting as such is significant given these ominous signals at bilateral, regional and global levels,\" said Srikanth Kondapalli, professor of Chinese studies at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.\n\n\"Stabilizing relations is important as both are seized with a number of issues \u2013 domestic as well as regional,\" he said.\n\nAhead of Xi's trip to India, China invited Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for talks on bilateral issues. China supports Pakistan in safeguarding its independent sovereignty and territorial integrity, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday as he met Khan.\n\nThe Himalayan region of Kashmir is divided between India, Pakistan and China. India rules the populous Kashmir Valley and the Hindu-dominated region around Jammu city, while Pakistan controls a wedge of territory in the west, and China holds a thinly populated high-altitude area in the north.\n\nIndia and China also lay claim to territories thousands of miles to the east along the Himalayas and fought a brief border in 1962.\n\nIn recent years, India has drawn closer to both the United States, with which it has built closer military ties, and Japan.\n\nDuring Xi's visit, Modi is expected to raise economic issues, including India's $53 billion trade deficit with China in 2018/19, and the smaller presence of Indian companies in China compared with other major economies.\n\nChina, for its part, is expected to urge New Delhi to take an independent decision on telecom equipment maker Huawei\u2019s bid for India\u2019s proposed 3G network and not be swayed by U. S. pressure that it was a security risk.\n\nSources had told Reuters in August that Beijing had warned of \"reverse sanctions\" on Indian firms engaged in business in China should India block Huawei Technologies because of pressure from Washington.\n\nDuring the upcoming meeting, officials said Modi and Xi will tour the coastal town of Mamallapuram, near Chennai, home to an 8th century temple.\n\n(Additional reporting by Neha Dasgupta; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)", "description": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi will host Chinese President Xi Jinping for an informal summit later this week, the Indian foreign ministry said, with the talks coming at a time when ties have been strained over the disputed region of Kashmir.  \"The forthcoming Chennai Informal Summit will", "authors": ["Sanjeev Miglani"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
