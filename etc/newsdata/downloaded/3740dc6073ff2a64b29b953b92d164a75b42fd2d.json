But knowing he lacked the pace to go clear of the cover, Slade produced a superbly weighted grubber kick regathered by Jonny May for the left wing\u2019s second try in three minutes.\n\nIt was a key play as, with Farrell adding the conversion, it meant England led 14-3 in the 23rd minute.\n\nFrom then on it was their match to lose and before the half was over, Slade showed his defensive skills with an important tackle on Kerevi.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Come into modern rugby\u2019 \u2013\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with selection, 10 (Farrell), 12 (Manu Tuilagi) and 13 (Slade) had a lot of defensive work early in the game,\u201d Jones told reporters. \u201cSo Sladey did a great job.\u201d\n\nJones replaced Slade with Ford in the 61st minute as Farrell moving across to the centres, but by that stage the Exeter midfielder had more than played his part.\n\n\u201cI thought George Ford came on in the second half and was absolutely spectacular, he filled his role superbly, kept turning Australia around when we needed to,\u201d said Jones, who bristled when it was suggested he had \u201cdropped\u201d the Leicester stand-to the replacements in his matchday 23.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t drop him mate, I changed his role. I know you guys (the media) struggle with that.\n\n\u201cMaybe you guys have got to start reporting differently, maybe you\u2019ve got to stop reporting like you did 30 years ago? Come into modern rugby, join us, join us.\n\n\u201cRugby\u2019s changed, it\u2019s a 23-man game.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Forwards win games and backs decide by how many points, runs the old rugby adage.
