NO ARCHIVES\n\nNeed to Impeach, a group funded mainly by billionaire Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, has already spent millions of dollars convincing Democrats to impeach Trump.\n\nThe organisation is turning its attention to Republicans facing tough re-election battles next year. The group announced last week it was launching a $3.1 million ad campaign targeting incumbent Republican senators, including Cory Gardner of Colorado and Joni Ernst of Iowa.\n\nLeaders of the group told Reuters they will extend that campaign, spending an initial $500,000 on digital media ads focussed on 10 Republicans in the most competitive House districts, including Representatives Pete King of New York and Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe are going to run ads questioning their patriotism. What we have learned is that when a few people come out for impeachment, then a lot of people follow,\u201d said Kevin Mack, the organisation\u2019s lead strategist.\n\nThe ads, seen by Reuters, ask Republicans to put \u201cCountry over Party.\u201d\n\nOther House Republican targets are John Katko and Lee Zeldin of New York; Rodney Davis of Illinois; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington; Scott Perry of Pennsylvania; and Michael McCaul and Chip Roy of Texas.\n\n\u201cBased on everything I have seen and heard, I am strongly opposed to impeachment - as I was opposed to Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. The digital ads will have no effect on my vote or influence my position,\u201d King said in an emailed statement.\n\nKatie Vincentz, a spokesperson for Zeldin, said, \u201cRadical Democrats have an unlimited supply of dark money for their frequent lies and nasty attacks, but once again that will be money poorly spent by the left on another well-deserved loss next year.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry after a whistleblower alleged that Trump used U.S. military aid to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nRepublicans targeted by the ads have either supported the inquiry but not impeachment, or criticized Democrats for getting ahead of the facts.\n\nNeed to Impeach will also spend money thanking a group of eight Democratic House members in competitive districts for supporting impeachment.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing. His re-election campaign has stepped up its digital advertising, spending $1.4 million on thousands of digital ads designed to reach voters in every state as the inquiry unfolded, according to data analysed by Laura Edelson, a researcher at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sept. 24 found 37% of Americans thought Trump should be impeached and 45% said he should not. A week later, the percentage favoring impeachment rose to 45% in the poll, with opponents of impeachment down to 41%.", "description": "A group pushing for President Donald Trump's impeachment will launch a six-figure digital ad campaign on Tuesday, targeting vulnerable Republicans in the House of Representatives at a time polls show a growing percentage of Americans favour impeachment.", "authors": ["Jarrett Renshaw", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438615092&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF971NQ", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
