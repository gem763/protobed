I think it's a terrible disaster.\n\n'We will look back on it like the invention of nuclear weapons as something we really wish we hadn't done.'\n\nThe Would I Lie to You? star also hit out at the impact of online shopping on the high street, cyber-bullying and the 'post-truth' world of fake news spread by social media.\n\n'There's the fact that literally all the time, everywhere we go there's people staring at their phones, talking to people on social media, insulting people on social media or bullying people on social media,' he added.\n\nThe BBC star also hit out at the impact of online shopping on the high street, cyber-bullying and fake news spread by social media. He said he would prefer to go back to the late-1980s\n\n'There's the fact it's destroying our areas of traditional areas of commerce, shops you actually walk into, which in itself is destroying the fabric of these settlements we live in a way that nobody wants.'\n\nMitchell said he would prefer to go back to the late-1980s because 'broadly everything good coming out of technology I think we'd got by then'.\n\nHe said: 'Landlines, answerphones, video recorders, news from Ceefax.'\n\nBut he added: 'We can't go back. We're stuck with it.'", "description": "The BBC star, 45, was speaking to a crowd at the Cheltenham Literature Festival when he hit out at the impact of online shopping on the high street as well as cyber-bullying and fake news.", "authors": ["Richard Marsden For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/00/19670754-0-image-a-50_1571009696404.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
