There was even talk of an alliance between the socialists. ERC assembly representative Gabriel Rufian called for a new start, urging the Socialist government of Pedro Sanchez to \u201cbring politics back to this political conflict and remove judicial robes and police batons\u201d.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

There has been no pact and the government has ruled out a fresh referendum. And on Monday morning, the Supreme Court in Madrid handed lengthy prison sentences to nine of the detained Catalonian leaders for up to 13 years each, with Oriel Junqueras of the ERC, the former Catalan vice-president and the highest ranking official in the trial, among those receiving the maximum term.\n\nAlthough the public strife of two years ago has not been repeated, the Catalan \u201cCommittees for the Defence of the Republic\u201d (CDR) has vowed direct action, including the blocking of roads and railway lines. Just over a week ago, nine members of the CDR were arrested, and seven of them charged with belonging to a terrorist organisation, allegedly possessing explosives \u2013 and with the ultimate aim of targeting the infrastructure system.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

It is time for the #PopularRevolt.\u201d\n\nThere was disquiet across Catalan society. Barcelona Football Club tweeted: \u201cPrison is not the solution. The resolution of the conflict in Catalonia must come exclusively from political dialogue.\u201d\n\nThe trial in Madrid \u2013 which had lasted four months with 422 witnesses appearing \u2013 cleared the defendants of acts of violent rebellion, carrying sentences of up to 25 years, and found them guilty of the lesser charges of sedition and misuse of public funds.\n\nBut that did not assuage anger. Demonstrations began in Barcelona soon after the news broke from the court. Police were deployed to the city\u2019s key junctions, the airport and Sants railway station, as well as some outlying towns.\n\nSanchez, the acting prime minister, took a robust line, stressing his government backed the court\u2019s decision and declaring that \u201cnobody is above the law. In a democracy like Spain nobody is subject to trial for his or her ideas or politics but rather for criminal conduct as provided by the law.\u201d The independence movement, he charged, had ignored the constitution and fractured Catalan society.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

For the future of our sons and daughters. For democracy. For Europe. For Catalonia.\u201d\n\nYet Puigdemont\u2019s own conduct illustrated the weaknesses and divisions in the separatist movement. Having instigated the referendum and the inevitable standoff with Madrid that followed, he flew to Brussels rather than take up his post.\n\nThose of us covering events on the ground at the time recall firstly the disappointment in Barcelona after he disappeared, which gradually turned to resentment as other leaders who had stayed behind were being arrested.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Every time that Catalonia has revolted - in pictures 1/14 Reapers' War In 1640, amidst the Thirty Years War, Philip IV of Spain sent his Castilian soldiers into the Catalan region to defend the border with France. The soldiers were not on their best behaviour and drew the ire of the Catalan peasants and politicians alike, at a time when the region was already agitated by economic decline. On June 7, reapers arriving to Barcelona for seasonal harvest work were dismayed to find little of the sort and blamed the stationed soldiers. After a reaper was killed, the revolt began in full force with a fierce uprising known as Corpus de Sang (depicted here in a 1910 painting by Ermenegild Miralles) Ermenegild Miralles i Angl\u00e8s 2/14 Reapers' War More Castilian forces arrived, strengthening the Catalan resolve and leading Pau Claris, President of the Generalitat (Catalonia's political assembly) to declare Catalonia an independent republic on January 17 1641. A week later the republic swore its allegiance to Louis XIII of France and the war came to a head at the Battle of Montju\u00efc (depicted above by Pandolfo Reschi) where the Franco-Catalan forces were victorious.

Those attending went to the Ghent opera house for a performance of the Duke of Alba before the meeting got under way. But any inspiration Puigdemont and his advisers may have drawn from the tale of the 16th century Spanish general\u2019s brutal reign in Flanders ending ultimately in defeat did not result in him returning.\n\nOne waits to see what happens now. Sanchez stated that he will \u201cwork in the coming days to guarantee public order and protect our democratic laws as it has always done, responding proportionally to any violations of the law. The government will continue to work to repair the fracture created by the separatist movement.\u201d The acting prime minister also called for dialogue with the separatists. The ERC responded that this would not be possible without an \u201camnesty\u201d for \u201cpolitical prisoners and those in exile\u201d.\n\nElections are scheduled for 10 November. More immediately, demonstrators will march from five towns to Barcelona where they will meet on Friday, when a general strike has been called. Further protests, say organisers, will continue until the imprisoned leaders get \u201cjustice.\u201d\n\nThere is apprehension that the violence of two years ago may be revisited. The chaotic scenes, especially of state violence, taking place in Europe, in a city like Barcelona, were shocking for many. On the day the Catalan officials were jailed, the Spanish government launched a PR campaign. The acting prime minister tweeted: \u201cSpain is a consolidated democracy. It\u2019s one of the most advanced rules of law in the world and one of the most free and safe countries. This is the real Spain. We\u00b4ve done it together, citizens and institutions. Based on coexistence, respect and the law.\u201d\n\nBut Catalans, as well as other Spaniards, pointed out during the strife of 2017 that bitter reminders from history continue to cast a dark shadow on the country.\n\nThe Day of the Dead was being commemorated at that time. Friends and relations had gathered together to lay flowers and light candles on the graves of their departed, as is the custom. The thought of many at the time however, was not of just the past, but what lay ahead in an uncertain future.\n\nThe Garrigo family had come to the cemetery on the slope of the Montjuic hills to pay their respect to their grandfather who was killed in a battle at Terrasa in Spain\u2019s civil war \u2013 one among the thousands who sacrificed their lives trying to save Barcelona from the advancing forces of General Franco.\n\nVincenc Garrigo, a 24-year-old engineer, trade unionist and volunteer soldier was killed in a mortar barrage. His grandson Jaume reflected: \u201cI have read his letters to my grandmother, what they all went through at the time, and I feel very proud. That was a time of war when people had to stand up to the dictators; to Franco, Hitler and Mussolini. People at home also suffered very much as well \u2013 often they had no heating, little food, little water, but they didn\u2019t give up.\n\n\u201cSo we are used to hardship in Catalonia, used to standing up for our rights. This struggle for independence, for real autonomy which means something, will not end. What happens will depend on whether the government in Madrid wants to have proper dialogue or they think they can win by confrontation. We are not going to give up.\u201d", "description": "There were celebrations and optimism among Catalan separatists in April after a party committed to independence came out on top in the region in national elections for the first time since the end of Franco and the return of democracy to Spain.
