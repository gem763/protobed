'He died like a dog, he died like a coward.'\n\nBut questions have since been raised about Trump's vivid description of Baghdadi's death, including how he knew that the ISIS leader was 'crying and whimpering' given there was no audio on the livestream he was watching.\n\nSeveral senior Trump administration officials told the Daily Beast they don't know where the President got those specific details from.\n\nTwo of them said they immediately began messaging each other after Trump's address saying 'uh where is he getting that?'.\n\nOfficials said it was possible that Trump may have spoken to the commandos who were on the ground in Syria for the raid but that had not been in the case in past operations.\n\nThe country's top military officer, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, also said on Monday that he didn't know where Trump got his details from when he faced repeated questions from reporters.\n\n'I know the president had planned to talk down to the unit and unit members,' General Milley said.\n\n'But I don't know what the source of that was. I assume it was talking directly to unit and unit members.'\n\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi (above) blew himself up after being cornered by U.S forces in a dead-end underground tunnel in his Syrian compound\n\nTrump watched the raid unfold from the situation room. He was joined by National Security Advisor Robert C. O'Brien, Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of Defense Dr. Mark T. Esper and United States Army General Mark A. Milley\n\nGeneral Milley said he had not spoken with unit members on the ground so he did not have firsthand knowledge of those details.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark T. Esper gave a similar response when asked if he, like Trump, had heard whimpering and crying.\n\n'I don't have those details,' Esper said.\n\n'The president probably had the opportunity to talk to the commanders on the ground.'\n\nA source close to Trump has said it is one of the President's favorite insults to accuse his enemies of 'being weak and just crying all over the place'.\n\nThe daring raid on the compound where Baghdadi was hiding in Syria was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work - and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word on where he would be.\n\nTrump had teased a major announcement late Saturday, tweeting that 'something very big has just happened!' By the morning, he was thanking Russia, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, as well as Kurdish fighters in Syria for their support.\n\nThe operation marks a significant foreign policy success for Trump, coming at one of the lowest points in his presidency as he is mired in impeachment proceedings and facing widespread Republican condemnation for his Syria policy.\n\nThe daring raid on the compound (above) where Baghdadi was hiding in Syria was the culmination of years of steady intelligence-gathering work - and 48 hours of hurry-up planning once Washington got word on where he would be\n\nAl-Baghdadi, the leader of the so-called Islamic caliphate, blew himself up during the targeted attack on his lair in Syria's Idlib province in the early hours of Sunday morning. His lair was in a village known for smuggling, and he arrived there 48 hours before the raid\n\nThe recent pullback of U.S. troops he ordered from northeastern Syria raised a storm of bipartisan criticism in Washington that the militant group could regain strength after it had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled.\n\nPlanning for the operation began weeks ago, Trump said, after the U.S. gained unspecified intelligence on Baghdadi's whereabouts.\n\nEight military helicopters flew for more than an hour over territory controlled by Russian and Syrian forces, Trump said, before landing under gunfire at the compound.\n\nTrump vividly described the raid and took extensive questions from reporters for more than 45 minutes Sunday.\n\nHe said U.S. forces breached the walls of the building because the doors were booby-trapped and chased Baghdadi into the tunnel, which partially collapsed after Baghdadi detonated the suicide vest.\n\nTrump also revealed that U.S. forces spent roughly two hours on the ground collecting valuable intelligence.\n\nHe went on to suggest that the killing of Baghdadi was more significant than the 2011 operation ordered by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the 9/11 attacks.", "description": "Trump officials say they have no idea where the President got his information that ISIS leader\u00a0Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died 'crying and whimpering'.", "authors": ["Emily Crane For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20325390-0-image-a-2_1572355537075.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
