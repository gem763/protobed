(The Logic)\n\nThis \"could be good for them if, let's say, they're trying to stop illegal activity or terrorist financing, but may also have unintended negative consequences,\" he explained.\n\nThe Bank of Canada's deputy governor, Tim Lane, recently told a panel at the International Monetary Fund that \"if you are transferring large amounts, then the law enforcement officials could have access with proper authorization.\"\n\nBut Schwartz said that the kind of authorization required for that access is currently undefined.\n\n\"You'd want to have clear safeguards,\" he said.\n\nCryptocurrency is big business, but for many not in the tech sphere, it's still a big unknown. Here are answers to some questions you might have. 2:31\n\nCurrently, authorities require a warrant to acquire an individual's spending information through their bank. But Schwartz said it's unclear if that would be the case with a Canadian digital currency \u2014 or whether users would even know if their information had been accessed by government or police.\n\n\"It's entirely possible that a balance could be struck that Canadians would be happy with,\" Schwartz said.\n\n\"But right now all we have is the Bank of Canada saying [they would] like to be able to share information with police and tax authorities, but we don't really have any further details than that.\"\n\nIn an email statement, the Bank of Canada told The Current: \"Any potential system would need the support of government and would have to comply with Canadian privacy laws. The public values privacy, and this is an important feature we would seek to maintain in designing a Canadian banking digital currency.\"\n\nWritten by Allie Jaynes.
