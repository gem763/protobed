Poets Kiki Petrosino (author of the acclaimed \u201cWitch Wife\u201d) and Annie Finch (\u201cThe Poetry Witch: Little Book of Spells\u201d) read poems about witchcraft, magic and the natural world. The Folger\u2019s curators are assembling a special display of books about witches from the library\u2019s collection for the night. So don\u2019t be surprised to see a few weird sisters. 7:30 p.m. $15.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTuesday, Oct. 29\n\nHigh heel race on 17th Street NW: A D.C. institution for more than 30 years returns to the streets near Dupont Circle. Since 1986, every Tuesday before Halloween has been marked by D.C. residents putting on their finest heels and racing on foot for all of 0.1 miles. If you\u2019re not able to get on the appropriate gear, you can park yourself on one of the sidewalks or restaurants along 17th Street NW for a great view of the action. The race begins at 9 p.m. but competitors and onlookers come as early as 6 p.m. to take in the sights. Race at 9 p.m. Free.\n\nAD\n\nSpektral Quartet at the Kennedy Center: During Spektral Quartet\u2019s program \u201cLooking Skyward,\u201d presented by Washington Performing Arts, a world premiere from cutting-edge Icelandic composer Anna Thorvaldsdottir will follow a piece by Beethoven. That\u2019s par for the course for this Grammy-nominated Chicago string quartet, which explores the connections between classical masterworks and music written more recently. This Kennedy Center performance by the group will include a selection from 16th-century Spanish composer Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria and Thorvaldsdottir\u2019s \u201cEnigma,\u201d which is inspired by a solar eclipse and set to video art by Sigurdur Gudjonsson. 7:30 p.m. $40.\n\nAD\n\nDay of the Dead Festival at Oyamel: Oyamel\u2019s annual Day of the Dead festival takes inspiration from a different artist on its ofrenda each year. This year\u2019s honoree is singer Ritchie Valens and the city of Veracruz, where the folk song \u201cLa Bamba\u201d was born. While Tuesday night\u2019s five-course dinner has sold out, guests can still order a la carte from the Dia de los Muertos menu, offered through Nov. 3. Specialties include arroz a la tumbada, with pan-seared calamari, striped bass and head-on prawns served on a bed of rice; and tacos de berenjena, okra and eggplant tacos with a smoky salsa macha.

Prices vary.\n\nWednesday, Oct. 30\n\nAD\n\nJay Som at Rock & Roll Hotel: Melina Mae Duterte, who records as Jay Som, had largely created music within her own solitary ecosystem, recording most of her work in her bedroom. But for her fourth record, \u201cAnak Ko,\u201d Duterte let some friends in on the recording process, including Vagabon\u2019s Laetitia Tamko, Chastity Belt\u2019s Annie Truscott and a full band. The collaborative effort spawned nine songs that seem to blossom in real time \u2014 in the case of \u201cDevotion,\u201d a feather-light, jazzy melody unravels into a dreamy haze of vocals. On \u201cIf You Want It,\u201d a jangly guitar morphs into a psychedelic swirl of sound. It\u2019s clear Duterte is still very much in control on \u201cAnak Ko,\u201d but her guest collaborators bring newfound depth to her expansive sound. 8 p.m. $18.\n\nAD\n\nSuperfine Art Fair at Union Market: Get a gallery wall started at Superfine, which returns to Union Market\u2019s Dock 5 space after drawing 4,000 art lovers to last year\u2019s inaugural event.

Ondara croons about his lofty plans of coming to this country, and reveals the pain that came with this move. \u201cWell, everybody there told me/ This girl she ain\u2019t good for your health/ She ain\u2019t good for your health/ But I was head over heels,\u201d he recounts on one of the record\u2019s most heart-wrenching songs, \u201cTelevision Girl.\u201d 8 p.m. $20-$25.\n\nAD\n\nRevisiting \u2018Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u2019: A Night of Tales and Terror at the Crown & Crow: For almost four decades, preteens have been scaring themselves silly with the stories collected in \u201cScary Stories to Tell in the Dark\u201d and its two sequels.

Thank heaven for kid-safe carving tools, eh? This night of arts and crafts for adults finds talented artists creating intricate designs on their pumpkins, while others work on more rudimentary jack-o\u2019-lanterns. The Derby provides pumpkins to the first 10 singles or groups, so you might want to bring your own gourd to ensure you get one. Important rules: No carving allowed before 7 p.m., and the judging begins promptly at 9, with bar tabs and other prizes up for grabs. 7 p.m. Free.\n\nAD\n\nHalloween at the Line Hotel: There\u2019s a multimodal Halloween party going on at the Line Hotel in Adams Morgan: Local muralist Kasey O\u2019Boyle leads a free, colorful pumpkin painting class for families on the hotel\u2019s front steps from 4 to 6 p.m., with free cider and sweets, while all ages can trick-or-treat inside with Erik Bruner-Yang\u2019s restaurant Brothers and Sisters.

As such, it\u2019s also rumored to be haunted. Learn more about Smithson and the ghosts who haunt the Mall\u2019s Gothic/Romanesque edifice on a special Halloween tour, and then learn the choreography to the \u201cThriller\u201d video in the Castle\u2019s Great Hall. 5:30 p.m. Free.\n\nAD\n\nFriday, Nov. 1\n\nAD\n\nBad Bunny at EagleBank Arena: After spending the past few years building buzz with loose singles and guest appearances \u2014 including a chart-topping one on Cardi B\u2019s \u201cI Like It\u201d \u2014 Bad Bunny decided that 2019 would be his. So far, the king of Latin trap has delivered, surprise-releasing his debut album last Christmas Eve and a collaborative one with Colombian reggaeton star J Balvin. The 25-year-old Puerto Rican talent with the moody baritone provided an uber-contemporary spin on not just Latin trap but bachata, reggaeton, even pop-punk and synth-pop on his solo record, then provided a soundtrack for the summer with \u201cOasis\u201d on his way to conquering the wide world of urbano. 8 p.m. $119-$149.\n\nAngel Olsen at the Lincoln Theatre: When it came time for Angel Olsen to craft her fourth album, the Asheville, N.C.-based singer-songwriter intended to record the album twice \u2014 first, as bare-bones solo songs before rerecording with a full band. But once she heard how staggering the songs were when fully formed, Olsen knew only the second version would suffice. Whether augmented by orchestra or synthesizers, the songs of \u201cAll Mirrors\u201d take the 32-year-old to dizzying heights. Quiet moments explode into widescreen epics as her lyrics grieve for broken hearts and celebrate mended ones. \u201cThis record is about owning up to your darkest side, finding the capacity for new love and trusting change even when you feel like a stranger,\u201d Olsen says. Friday and Saturday at 6:30 p.m. $35; Friday sold out.\n\nAD\n\n\u2018The Sporkful\u2019 live at the Miracle Theatre: You might have seen his face on Cooking Channel equipped with various food hacks or heard his voice on different NPR programs, but Dan Pashman is best known in food circles for his James Beard Award-winning podcast \u201cThe Sporkful.\u201d Pashman talks with guests from the food and pop culture world and, fittingly for his D.C. show, he\u2019ll host Kith and Kin chef Kwame Onwuachi at the Barracks Row theater. 6:30 p.m. $18.\n\nAD\n\nNicole Byer at DC Improv: Comedian Nicole Byer is at her best when she\u2019s being her silliest self, which is probably why \u201cNailed It!\u201d \u2014 the Netflix show she hosts where bad home bakers compete in various challenges \u2014 has been such a hit. Equally adept at improv and stand-up, Byer hosts two podcasts: one about dating, \u201cWhy Won\u2019t You Date Me?\u201d and one about friendship, \u201cBest Friends,\u201d which she co-hosts with Sasheer Zamata. Byer will perform a string of sold-out shows all weekend. Through Sunday.
