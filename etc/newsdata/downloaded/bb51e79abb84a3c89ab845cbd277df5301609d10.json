We thought they were better for us than sugar but new research says they\u2019re just as bad, possibly even worse.\n\nThis shocking news emerged from a study of more than 450,000 middle-aged people started 16 years ago and followed up until now.\n\nAnd earlier this year two other studies rang the alarm bell, one of them finding obese women who drank just two diet drinks a day doubled their risk of stroke. This new study adds to the mounting evidence about the harm artificial sweeteners can do.\n\nScientists found that people who drank more than two sugary drinks a day were 17% more likely to die \u00adprematurely than those who rarely had them. But, much more frightening, the risk of premature death was even higher in people who consumed drinks containing artificial sweeteners.\n\nAnd the case against artificial \u00adsweeteners gets even stronger. They were also found to increase the risk of heart disease by 40%. What\u2019s going on?\n\nWell, we\u2019re only now learning how damaging artificial sweeteners are on the 100 trillion bacteria in our guts that are so essential for our health.\n\nIt turns out artificial sweeteners knock those good bacteria for six. We\u2019ve found out this intriguing fact by doing some ingenious experiments.\n\nArtificial sweeteners were given to mice that were split into three groups \u2013 some were given water, some sugary water, and some water with saccharin.\n\nMice in the saccharin group stopped being able to handle glucose, the first step on the way to diabetes.\n\nWhen faecal samples from the gut bacteria of these mice were given to other normal mice they also developed glucose intolerance.\n\nPlus they grew bacteria associated with obesity and diabetes. The worrying finding was that the same thing happened with human beings.\n\nWhy? The theory is artificial \u00adsweeteners provoke inflammation, which encourages obesity.\n\nSure enough, a recent study of more than 7,000 American teenagers found the zero-calorie diet drinkers consumed 200 extra calories a day, which could lead to being overweight.\n\nIt seems consuming something sweet tricks the brain into expecting a sugar hit, and in anticipation of this the body releases insulin, lowering blood sugar.\n\nBut when the sugar doesn\u2019t come, the brain tries to make up for it by releasing hormones that trigger hunger pangs so you eat more.\n\nIf you still want to use an artificial sweetener, opt for stevia which doesn\u2019t seem to affect gut bacteria.", "description": "We thought artificial sweeteners were better for us than sugar but evidence suggests they are even worse", "authors": ["Miriam Stoppard", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20743262.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Opening-a-ring-pull-can.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
