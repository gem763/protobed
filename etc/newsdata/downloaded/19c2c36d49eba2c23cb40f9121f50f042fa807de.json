That gives the media a reason to play up his every anti-Trump comment.\n\nThere are very few conservatives who would regard George Conway\u2019s behavior as being in any way \u201cconservative.\u201d Most regard it as an effort to join the left in ousting Trump \u2014 and an unseemly public attack on his wife\u2019s career.\n\nThe Post reported that the 16 lawyers who signed the statement urging Trump\u2019s impeachment over his July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky hope it will be read by Republicans who support the president.\n\nHowever, the fact that George Conway is the most \u201cprominent conservative\u201d in the bunch does not bode well.\n\nIn April, following the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report \u2014 which found no collusion with Russia \u2014 Conway wrote a Post op-ed demanding that Congress impeach and remove the \u201ccancer\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nGeorge Conway has also accused Trump of mental illness; said that White House staff \u201cwork for a rapist\u201d; mocked Trump\u2019s defense against claims of campaign finance violations (later dismissed); and called the administration a \u201cshit show in a dumpster fire.\u201d He also said he did not feel comfortable being called a Republican anymore.\n\nJoel B.
