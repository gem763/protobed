Both cases involve the standard first laid out by the court in 1992 that while states can regulate abortion they can\u00b4t do things that place an \"undue burden\" on a woman\u00b4s right to an abortion.\n\nLouisiana abortion providers and a district judge who initially heard the case said one or maybe two of the state's three abortion clinics would have to close under the new law. There would be at most two doctors who could meet its requirements, they said.\n\nBut the appeals court in New Orleans rejected those claims, doubting that any clinics would have to close and saying the doctors had not tried hard enough to establish relationships with local hospitals.\n\nIn January, the full appeals court voted 9-6 not to get involved in the case, setting up the Supreme Court appeal.\n\nIn February, the justices split 5-4 to keep the law on hold. Chief Justice John Roberts, a dissenter in the 2016 case from Texas, joined with the court's four liberal justices to temporarily block the Louisiana measure.\n\nPro-life groups tend to dominate politics in Louisiana because of the state's deep roots in evangelical Christianity\n\nCritics of the law say that if the Supreme Court restores the Louisiana law, it could leave the state with just one abortion clinic\n\nFor Roberts, it was a rare vote against an abortion restriction in more than 13 years as chief justice, perhaps a reflection of his new role since Kennedy's retirement as the court's swing justice and his concern about the court being perceived as a partisan institution.\n\nGorsuch and Kavanaugh, along with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, would have allowed Louisiana to begin enforcing the clinic regulations.\n\nThe Hope Medical Group clinic in Shreveport, Louisiana, and two doctors whose identities are not revealed said in their appeal that the justices should strike down the law without even holding arguments because the decision so clearly conflicts with the Texas ruling from 2016.\n\nThe court did not follow that path Friday.\n\nThere also was no action on a third abortion-related appeal that involves a challenge to a Chicago ordinance that stops protesters from getting within 8 feet (2.4 meters) of people entering abortion clinics and other health care facilities without their consent.\n\nAnti-abortion activists had challenged the Chicago law as a violation of their free speech rights. The federal appeals court in Chicago upheld the law, though grudgingly.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld a similar Colorado law in 2000, but in 2014 struck down a Massachusetts provision that set a fixed 35-foot buffer zone outside abortion clinics.", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court is adding an abortion case to its busy election-year docket, agreeing to take up a Louisiana law that could leave the...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/16/19303878-0-image-a-9_1570203846003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
