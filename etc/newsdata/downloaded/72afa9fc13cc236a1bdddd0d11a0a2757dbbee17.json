Today at New York Comic Con, Kroll announced a Big Mouth spinoff called Human Resources that will focus on the world of monsters teased in the last season of Mouth. \u201cWe are incredibly excited to tell a lot of different kinds of stories, not just about puberty, but all the stories of life,\u201d Kroll told the crowd. He didn\u2019t share any details about the show, beyond that it will basically be a workplace comedy, but the actor did say a new female hormone monster will join Big Mouth next season. So, maybe we\u2019ll be seeing her around the office in Human Resources, too. BoJack Horseman may be on its way out at Netflix, but at least it\u2019s picking up adult Monsters, Inc.", "description": "Nick Kroll announced at New York Comic Con that a Big Mouth spinoff called Human Resources is on the way, and it will focus on the world of the monsters.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2018/12/22/22-kroll.w1200.h630.jpg"}
