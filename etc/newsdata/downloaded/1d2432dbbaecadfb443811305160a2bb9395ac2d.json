GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares on track for weekly loss amid mounting U.S. political uncertainties\n\n* Trump Whistleblower report seen raising U.S. uncertainties\n\n* U.S.-China trade talks expected in early October\n\n* Asian stock markets: https://tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4\n\nBy Hideyuki Sano\n\nTOKYO, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Asian shares were on course for a\n\nsecond straight week of losses on Friday as the release of a\n\nwhistleblower complaint against U.S. President Donald Trump\n\nheightened uncertainties about the global economy, already\n\nreeling from Sino-U.S. trade war.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan\n\nslipped 0.09%, having fallen 1.4% so far this\n\nweek, while Japan's Nikkei slid 0.54%.\n\nU.S. S&P500 futures lost 0.08% in early Asian trading\n\nafter the index lost 0.24% on Thursday.\n\nA whistleblower report released on Thursday said President\n\nDonald Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit\n\nUkraine's interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his\n\npolitical benefit, but that the White House tried to \"lock down\"\n\nevidence about that conduct.\n\nThe report came after the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment inquiry into him\n\nthis week.\n\n\"The start of the impeachment inquiry adds a new element of\n\nuncertainties to markets, in addition to ongoing concerns about\n\nthe U.S.-China trade war and the risk of a U.S. recession,\" said\n\nNorihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ\n\nMorgan Stanley Securities.\n\n\"While no one thinks the Senate will vote for his\n\nimpeachment given the Republican majority there, we could see\n\nmore new revelations during a long investigation process,\" he\n\nadded, noting that U.S. stocks fell considerably when former\n\nPresident Bill Clinton was impeached.\n\nOn trade issues, news headlines were too mixed for investors\n\nto show a clear reaction.\n\nCNBC reported that trade war talks were scheduled for Oct.\n\n10-11 in Washington, citing people familiar with the\n\narrangements, and China's top diplomat said China was willing to\n\nbuy more U.S. products. But other media reports on Thursday that the United States\n\nis unlikely to allow American firms to supply China's Huawei\n\nTechnologies HWT.UL undermined hopes of a complete deal.\n\nThe damage is already evident with Micron Technology Inc\n\n, a major Huawei supplier, which forecast first-quarter\n\nprofit below Wall Street targets, pushing its share prices down\n\n7% in after-hours trade. In the currency market, the euro flirted with 2 1/2-year\n\nlows amid concerns about sluggish growth in the currency bloc,\n\nwith fear of recession in its powerhouse, Germany.\n\nThe euro stood at $1.0918 after hitting a near 2\n\n1/2-year low of $1.0909.\n\nSome market players suspect the dollar was also helped by\n\ncontinued tightness in dollar funding after U.S. short-term\n\nborrowing costs shot up last week.\n\nThe dollar traded at 107.82 yen , after climbing to\n\n107.96 on Thursday.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2327 GBP=D4 , near two-week low of\n\n$1.2303 hit on Thursday, as investors waited for the British\n\nparliament's next attempt to break the Brexit impasse.\n\nThe Mexican peso weakened to a 2 1/2-week low of 19.675 to\n\nthe dollar after Mexico's central bank cut its key\n\ninterest rate on Thursday, with more cuts seen on the horizon.\n\nOil prices steadied off two-week lows as a Pentagon\n\nstatement intensified concerns of a Middle East conflict and\n\nsupply disruptions, although the impeachment inquiry into U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump kept risk assets broadly in check.\n\nBrent crude futures fell 0.53% to $62.41 a barrel\n\nbut stayed above Wednesday's low of $61.23, while U.S. West\n\nTexas Intermediate (WTI) crude lost 0.2% to $56.30 per\n\nbarrel, off their low of $55.41 on Thursday.", "description": "GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares on track for weekly loss amid mounting U.S. political uncertainties", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA7D094_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
