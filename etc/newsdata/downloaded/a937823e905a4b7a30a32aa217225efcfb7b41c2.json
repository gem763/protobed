So what that means is a challenging afternoon and evening of strong, dry offshore winds that will impact the fire area,\u201c Ryan Walbrun, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said in a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re in this critical 24-hour window.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt the same time, conditions in Southern California, where the Getty Fire scorched the western edge of Los Angeles on Monday, are expected to be even more dangerous: The Storm Prediction Center warned of \u201cextremely critical fire weather\u201d beginning late Tuesday, when record-setting Santa Ana winds are expected to whip across the region.\n\n\u201cWe have the most significant wind event in Los Angeles of the year that will be starting this evening,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti (D) said Tuesday. \u201cAll it takes is one ember cast that can come up, be tossed in the middle of the night or tomorrow, and we could see new fire or fires that emerge throughout this area.\u201d\n\nThe dire weather warnings came just days after Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declared a statewide emergency over wildfires \u2014 and amid an unprecedented wave of blackouts ordered by Pacific Gas & Electric, which has shut power to millions of customers in an effort to curb fire risk. Though the utility has restored some service, hundreds of thousands of people could remain without power until the latest windstorm passes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nNewsom told reporters Tuesday afternoon that PG&E had agreed to start crediting customers for the mass outages, which have left some people in the dark for nearly a week.\n\n\u201cThis is significant because utilities in the past have never credited customers for these disruptions,\u201d Newsom said, calling the blackouts \u201csimply unacceptable.\u201d\n\nIt was not immediately clear who would qualify for credits or how the process would work. A PG&E spokesman didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe state\u2019s largest utility has told regulators that a jumper on one of its transmission towers broke close to where the Kincade Fire started, near Geyserville. The cause of the fire, which has been burning since Wednesday, is under investigation as 4,548 firefighters battle the blaze.\n\nAD\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Tuesday that the Kincade Fire barely grew overnight, though at 75,415 acres \u2014 an area more than twice the size of San Francisco \u2014 it is already California\u2019s biggest fire of the year. The fire is now 15 percent contained, and officials said they expected it to burn until at least Nov. 7.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, officials allowed residents in part of an evacuation zone west of Healdsburg, Calif., to return home, but said other areas were almost certain to remain under mandatory evacuation as the winds come in.\n\nFirefighters are particularly concerned about the blaze spreading eastward into Lake County as gusts pick up. They\u2019re also trying to prevent the flames from jumping across Highway 101 to the west.\n\nAD\n\nFirefighters got a brief reprieve Monday when gusts died down, but they struggled to keep pace with the expanding blaze as winds changed direction, officials said. Even as officials lifted mandatory evacuation orders for parts of the county along the Pacific coast, they issued new evacuation warnings for a part of Lake County as the flames threatened to lurch eastward.\n\nAt least 124 structures have been destroyed in the fire, but no injuries of civilians have been reported \u2014 and there have been no deaths attributed to the blaze, which is burning in the same region where 22 people were killed in the Tubbs Fire in 2017. Officials said two firefighters had been injured, and one who was burned was in stable condition.\n\nAD\n\nEvacuations have largely gone smoothly as the nation\u2019s most populous state adapts to increasing wildfires that many officials link to climate change. Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick said at a news conference Tuesday that Northern California residents will have to be patient as they await the chance to return home.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to kind of wait and see how the winds behave, how the fire behaves, before we can talk about repopulation,\" he said.\n\nEmergency responders on the other end of the state are trying to control a fast-moving brush fire that has consumed about 656 acres on the western edge of Los Angeles \u2014 a slight growth since Monday \u2014 and forced the evacuation of more than 7,000 homes. Fire officials said Tuesday that the Getty Fire was 15 percent contained. At least 12 homes have been destroyed in the blaze, and five others have been damaged, officials said.\n\nAD\n\nThe International Association of Fire Fighters has more than 4,500 firefighters battling blazes across California, spokesman Timothy Burn said Tuesday. About 419 of those firefighters live in zones that have been evacuated.\n\nAD\n\nThe Getty and Kincade fires have been sparked by hurricane-like winds that for three years have caused fiery infernos to break out across the Golden State, which is coming to accept the blazes as the new normal. The gusts are known as Diablo winds in the San Francisco Bay area and Santa Ana winds in Southern California.\n\nRed flag warnings are up for the San Francisco Bay area and much of north-central California. The most volatile conditions in the vicinity of the Kincade Fire are forecast to occur from Tuesday through Wednesday afternoon, when winds in higher elevations may reach 65 mph.\n\nAD\n\nOffshore winds are also anticipated for lower elevations, which will lead to extremely dry air that is conducive for rapidly spreading wildfires. The ongoing offshore wind event, which is powered by the difference in air pressure between the Great Basin region and coastal California, is not anticipated to bring winds as high as the event over the weekend when the blaze began.\n\nAD\n\nNorthern California faced a blast of wind Wednesday and Thursday of last week, and again over the weekend, when it was whipped with hurricane-force gusts. The coming surge this week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, is expected to be the third windstorm in quick succession.\n\nThe repeated high wind events are resulting in dry vegetation that will burn easily if any new fires ignite. In fact, forecasters in San Francisco said they have never before seen three red flag warning events in a seven-day period.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business for 28 years; I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\u2019s forecast office serving the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nAD\n\nResidents of Southern California, particularly from Los Angeles and Ventura counties south to San Diego, are gearing up for what could be a record-setting Santa Ana wind event beginning around midnight Tuesday night and continuing through Thursday. A red flag warning has been hoisted for the metro L.A. area, where winds could gust as high as 80 mph in higher elevations and canyons and reach 70 mph in valley locations.\n\nIn an ominous sign, the National Weather Service said early Tuesday that the upcoming event promises to be a \u201chigh end dangerous event.\u201d One indicator of this is that the air pressure gradient, which controls how strong the winds will be, is forecast to be at record-high levels for late October and early November. In general, the greater the pressure gradient, the stronger the winds, since air flows from high to low pressure.\n\nGiven that there have been many Santa Ana wind events during this period, a record-setting event would be particularly dangerous and could cause significant damage of in the form of downed trees and power lines and minor structural damage, according to the NWS. Any fires that occur during this period could be nearly impossible to control.\n\nKim Bellware, Kayla Epstein, Hannah Knowles and Jason Samenow contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:", "description": "The Kincade Fire, which is threatening Sonoma County's population hub of Santa Rosa, has forced nearly 200,000 people to evacuate Northern California's wine country.", "authors": ["Derek Hawkins", "National", "Breaking News Reporter", "Marisa Iati", "General Assignment", "Metro Reporter", "Andrew Freedman", "Editor Focusing On Extreme Weather", "Climate Change", "Science"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3elgWO9YstbaHsRqXz9ZLe9SpzA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VOCGT2HZXMI6THQCDVC4WPP2R4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
