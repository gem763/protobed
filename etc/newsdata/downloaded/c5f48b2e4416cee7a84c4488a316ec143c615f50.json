(AP) \u2014 South Carolina coach Will Muschamp said freshman quarterback Ryan Hilinski has a sprained left knee, but was expected to play when the Gamecocks face No. 9 Florida on Saturday.\n\nMuschamp said Hilinski's injury was \"nothing serious\" and planned for him to start against the Gators this week.\n\nHilinski took a hard hit in the third quarter and pounded the ground in pain after the play. He was helped to the sidelines and watched the rest of the Gamecocks' 20-17, double-overtime upset of then-third ranked Georgia with ice on his knee.\n\nRedshirt freshman Dakereon Joyner finished off the dramatic win at quarterback for South Carolina.\n\nThe freshman began the year as a backup, but has started the past five games after senior Jake Bentley was lost to a season-ending foot injury.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
