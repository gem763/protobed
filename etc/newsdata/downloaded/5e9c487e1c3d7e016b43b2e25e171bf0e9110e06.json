Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower, reportedly a CIA officer, filed a complaint in August accusing Mr. Trump of pressuring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call to investigate Democratic frontrunner Joseph R. Biden and his son, Hunter. Congressional Democrats say Mr. Trump was threatening to withhold military aid to Ukraine, a charge the president denies.\n\nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Adam B. Schiff said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that his panel has reached an agreement with the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers for the unnamed person to testify to the committee behind closed doors.\n\n\u201cWe will get the unfiltered testimony of that whistleblower,\u201d he said.\n\nThe California Democrat also said his committee is \u201ctaking all the precautions we can to make sure that we do so \u2014 we allow that testimony to go forward in a way that protects the whistleblower\u2019s identity, because as you can imagine, when the president is showing threats like, \u2018We ought to treat these people who expose my wrongdoing as we used to treat traitors and spies,\u2019 and we used to execute traitors and spies. You can imagine the security concerns here.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower said in the complaint that he relied on information provided by numerous other White House employees who also were not identified.\n\nThe administration released a transcript of the call last week after initially refusing to turn over any details to Congress.\n\nMr. Trump also went after Mr. Schiff Sunday night for his made-up summary of Mr. Trump\u2019s phone call. The California Democrat later said it was a \u201cparody\u201d of the call.\n\n\u201cSchiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cHis lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things, then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.\u201d\n\nThe president said \u201cradical\u201d Democrats \u201care doing great harm\u201d to the country.\n\n\u201cThey are lying & cheating like never before in our Country\u2019s history in order to destabilize the United States of America & it\u2019s upcoming 2020 Election,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey & the Fake News Media are Dangerous & Bad!\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
