David Bowie\u2019s \u201cHeroes\u201d played and a clip of Lagerfeld showed him sketching the first outfit he wore to Fendi in 1965. The spring 2020 collection, which showed today, hit the reset button.\n\nIn her first womenswear collection for Fendi, Silvia Venturini looked to bold, beautiful things: Bette Davis\u2019s film The Anniversary, oversize florals, and the psychedelic late 1960s. The models, including Gigi Hadid, Bella Hadid, and blonde Kendall Jenner, took their final walk to the 1969 hit \u201cAquarius/Let the Sunshine In.\u201d The song talks about the dawn of a new era of peace, love, and change. Surely it\u2019s not a reference to our current political era, so let\u2019s assume it\u2019s about the house itself.\n\nThe clothes included see-through gingham tees and Lurex baby-doll drseses, and the show closed with a magnificent floral gown that was made out of quilted fabric, like a grandmother\u2019s throw blanket. Venturini Fendi was inspired by summer holidays, particularly Italian ones (naturally), when you\u2019re relaxed and liberated and free. In addition to the Bette Davis film, she also screened Carry on Camping, a sexy slapstick film from the \u201960s.\n\nClockwise from left: Gigi Hadid Photo: Estrop/Getty Images Kaia Gerber Photo: Estrop/Getty Images Photo: Estrop/Getty Images Clockwise from left: Gigi Hadid Photo: Estrop/Getty Images Photo: Estrop/Getty Images Kaia Gerber Photo: Estrop/Getty Images\n\nIn an interview with Business of Fashion, Venturini talked about life at Fendi without Lagerfeld, who had been with Fendi since 1965. \u201cKarl was with Fendi for 54 years, so it doesn\u2019t sound \u2018natural\u2019 to refer to \u2018the Karl Lagerfeld era.\u2019 Now it\u2019s just the way we all think here.\u201d Now, she informs her collections with the Lagerfeld-ian sensibility. The mourning period is over, as far as runway collections are concerned, but his influence is not gone.\n\nMore hints that Fendi is moving forward? Nicki Minaj is designing a 127-piece collection for the house, a sexy collection made for people with curves like Minaj\u2019s \u2014 her words. The collection is logo-heavy, with bikinis, body-con dresses, and pink purses. Minaj told Elle she \u201cwant[s] to feel like I\u2019m back in Southside Jamaica, Queens, New York, wearing Fendi. I don\u2019t only want to be front row rocking my Fendi; I want to be in the hood rocking my Fendi, too.\u201d Fendi has done streetwear collabs before, recently with Fila, but this is the first that spotlights women who aren\u2019t sample size (although that\u2019s based on quotes from Minaj \u2014 no word on what the size range will be). The late \u201960s Dolce Vita collection we saw on the runway today didn\u2019t feature any curvy models. But perhaps a new era really is dawning.\n\nStay in touch.
