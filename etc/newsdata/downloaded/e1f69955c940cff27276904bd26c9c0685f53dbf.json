who had raised Karis since she was young - was overcome with grief.\n\nBut in the months following her death, his sadness turned to anger as he learnt of the mistakes before her death.\n\nHe said: \"I had no idea about any of the failures, all I knew that she'd died.\n\n(Image: Braithwaite Family)\n\n\"But in the months following her death, we began to discover how much they'd failed her.\n\n\"When I went to clear out the belongings from her home, I found pills under her bed.\n\n\"I didn't have a proper understanding what was going on.\"\n\nHe added: \"When I first found out, I didn't know how to feel.\n\n\"But as it continued, I would say I felt bewildered and dazed.\n\n\"I don't understand how they came to that conclusion based on the evidence they had.\n\n\"I know the shortcomings of the NHS and it's not entirely the health services fault.\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxx)\n\n\"I understand that but I really had hoped that the mental health service would have more understanding.\n\n\"I still don't believe it really now, I just still think that it's a terrible nightmare.\n\n\"It sounds crazy now but the safest place for her was in the hospital where she was.\"\n\nMark added: \"Karis was really good at concealing things.\n\n\"Just to get out of a conversation, she would say she was fine, and they knew this because of her history.\n\n\"She said to the paramedic that she had an active plan for suicide.\n\n(Image: Mark Bambridge)\n\n(Image: Braithwaite Family)\n\n\"She said it again and again and again, yet they never took it into consideration at all.\"\n\nFollowing her death, Karis' family made a formal complaint to the North East London Foundation NHS Trust.\n\nA report found that Karis \"showed clear and unequivocal evidence of suicidal behaviour of the highest risk\" adding \"the decision to discharge Karis so soon after the incident was not based on reliable information.\"\n\nWhile an independent expert witness said the decision to discharge or admit Karis to hospital would have been complex, he also concluded that \"the very serious suicide attempt should have resulted in her being detained and not released\".\n\nSenior coroner Nadia Persaud recorded a verdict of suicide and said: \"Karis Braithwaite took her own life in part because the risk of her doing so was not adequately assessed and appropriate precautions were not taken to prevent her from doing so.\n\n\"If Karis was admitted to hospital I am satisfied she would not have come by her death an hour later.\"\n\n(Image: Braithwaite Family)\n\nMs Persaud filed a report to prevent future deaths in relation to the handover between emergency services and NELFT in these types of incidents.\n\nOn behalf of Karis' family, Tim Deeming from Tees Law said: \"We are grateful to the coroner for carefully considering all of the evidence and concluding that Karis should not have been allowed to leave the hospital.\n\n\"However we are now calling on the hospital to demonstrate that they will change both how they obtain and consider all vital information needed to support and assess vulnerable patients, given that we understand similar issues have tragically happened before; as well as improving their culture given the evidence of the police and paramedics of ongoing resistance by the hospital in accepting patients like Karis who need such help and support.\"\n\nA trust spokesman said: \"We have offered our sincere condolences to Karis\u2019 family and friends following the tragic death of Karis.\n\n\"We are now in the process of putting the coroner\u2019s recommended actions in place and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage, in view of an ongoing legal claim.\"\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operates a free phoneline open 24/7.
