And Mexico, they argue, is paying for it. \u2026 Nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to Mexico\u2019s northern border, where they\u2019ve set up 20 checkpoints, Mexican Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country\u2019s security strategy. At the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints. \u2026 Officials also touted Mexico\u2019s first transatlantic deportation flight last week. A charter flight with more than 300 Indian nationals aboard flew from Toluca, Mexico, to New Delhi, Mexico\u2019s National Migration Institute said Wednesday.\n\nTo any sane American, this is an incredible victory. Trump successfully used international diplomacy (including the threat of tariffs) to get international cooperation that has finally resulted in some relief from our own border crisis. Because of that, our immigration system is under less stress, immigration centers are less crowded, and American border towns are not as overwhelmed with illegals who will either require 1) welfare, 2) medical care, or 3) a job that robs a law-abiding American of a job.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Mexicans were not happy with these caravans trooping through their country, so Mexico finally getting off the stick to enforce its own immigration laws is a plus for the citizens of that country.\n\nThe only people upset over an obvious win-win are the open border freaks desperate to flood our country with cheap labor, desperate to force an amnesty that will create more Democrats and turn the border states blue, and desperate to replace the American population with foreigners.\n\nAnd for this reason, CNN is desperate to paint the Mexican president as a Trump patsy:\n\nIn a recent New York Times column \u2014 headlined \u201cMexico is the wall\u201d \u2014 Univision anchor Jorge Ramos noted that Trump\u2019s comments that he was \u201cusing Mexico\u201d had riled many Mexicans. \u201cIt\u2019s true: President Trump is using Mexico. And, against all logic, Mexico is letting him get away with it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis has to change.\u201d \u2026 In some ways, Salazar says, L\u00f3pez Obrador is doing Trump\u2019s bidding when it comes to his government\u2019s handling of migrants. Such strict immigration enforcement along Mexico\u2019s southern border hasn\u2019t been seen before, she adds.\n\nThanks to Trump and L\u00f3pez Obrador, everything is better\u2026 Everything is better for America and Americans. Everything is better for our border patrol. Everything is better for Mexico and Mexicans. Everything is better for migrants abused by drug and sex traffickers. Everything is better for the migrants who caravan who make a perilous journey only to be sent home\u2026 Everything is better, unless of course you put your partisan beliefs and your hatred of Trump above your own humanity and the rule of law.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
