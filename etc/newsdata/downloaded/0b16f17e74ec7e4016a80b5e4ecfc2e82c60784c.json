Police responded for the most part with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon.\n\nTsang was shot during skirmishes in Tsuen Wan district, after protesters brandishing poles and umbrellas surrounded police and an officer fired his weapon at close range into the 18-year-old\u2019s chest.\n\nPolice said the officer feared for his life.\n\nBut protest groups said the officer charged into the melee with his firearm drawn, and condemned the increasing use of live rounds.\n\n'New territory'\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Scott Heidler, reporting from outside the hospital where Tsang is receiving treatment, said the shooting could be a tipping point.\n\n\u201cProtesters have been on the streets for four months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is new territory we\u2019re in now.\u201d\n\nSecondary school students were planning a mass class boycott following the shooting.\n\nOutside Tsang's school on Monday students chanted slogans and held pictures of the incident, taken from videos posted on Facebook.\n\n\"No rioters, only tyranny,\" they chanted, alongside other popular protest slogans.\n\nOne activist, her face covered in the now ubiquitous gas masks worn by protesters, sat next to a sign that read: \"With blood tears and sweat we shall stride ahead.\"\n\nTsang, who was filmed trying to strike the officer with a pole as he was shot, was taken to a nearby hospital in a critical condition but authorities said his condition has since improved.\n\n\"According to the latest information of the Hospital Authority, the current condition of the man is stable,\" the government said in a statement.\n\nA friend and classmate of Tsang, who gave his first name as Marco, said the 18-year-old was a keen basketballer and was infuriated by sliding freedoms in Hong Kong and the police response to the protests.\n\n\"If he sees any problems or anything unjust, he would face it bravely, speak up against it, instead of bearing it silently,\" Marco told AFP.\n\nHong Kong's police chief Stephen Lo said police would investigate the circumstances of the shooting, but defended his officers' conduct.\n\nPolice said 25 officers were injured in the clashes, including some who suffered chemical burns from a corrosive liquid that was thrown at them by protesters. The liquid also hit some journalists.\n\nA man detained by police during clashes in the Wanchai district of Hong Kong on Tuesday. [Anthony Wallace/AFP]\n\nHardening mood\n\nHospital authorities said more than 60 people were admitted on Tuesday, two in a critical condition. Police made some 160 arrests throughout the day.\n\nHong Kong's protests were ignited by a now-scrapped plan to allow extraditions to the mainland.\n\nBut they have snowballed into a wider movement calling for democratic freedoms and police accountability.\n\n4. Firing live rounds at HK protesters should not be a surprise from the first day that so-called \u201cHK Police\u201d started calling citizens of HK \u201ccockroaches\u201d to dehumanise anyone opposing their brutality. \u2014 Joshua Wong \u9ec3\u4e4b\u92d2 (@joshuawongcf) October 1, 2019\n\nWith Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam seemingly unwilling or unable to find a political solution, police have been left to deal with the increasingly angry protesters.\n\nSentiment is hardening on all sides.\n\nProtesters and some local residents routinely shout \"triads\" and other abuse at officers who are often heard calling demonstrators \"cockroaches\" and other slurs in return.\n\nSome 96 people are expected to be brought to court on Wednesday morning to face charges of rioting in relation to protests held last motnh. They face up to ten years in prison, if found guilty.\n\nThe protest movement's main demands are an independent inquiry into police actions, an amnesty for those arrested and universal suffrage.\n\nBeijing and Lam have said they are unwilling to meet those demands.", "description": "Secondary school students plan class boycott as 96 protesters expected to be brought to court on rioting charges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/1547d1818b19428d95913d5d6c257007_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
