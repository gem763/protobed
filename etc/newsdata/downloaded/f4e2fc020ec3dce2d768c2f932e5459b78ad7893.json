Mandatory Credit: Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMinkah Fitzpatrick got his wish, and the Miami Dolphins landed another first-round pick in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday.\n\nFitzpatrick was traded to the Steelers for a 2020 first-round pick, a 2020 fifth-round pick and a 2021 sixth-round pick . As part of the return, the Steelers also will get the Dolphins\u2019 2020 fourth-round pick and a 2021 seventh-round pick.\n\nThe 0-2 Dolphins have traded multiple starters for draft selections since breaking training camp and appear to be full steam ahead on a rebuild under first-year general manager Chris Grier and first-time head coach Brian Flores.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited to add Minkah to our defense,\u201d Steelers general manager and vice president Kevin Colbert said in a statement. \u201cWe had him rated very high during the 2018 NFL draft process and we thought that he could be an impact player in this league.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick, 22, requested a trade because his role changed week to week under Flores, including playing strong safety. Fitzpatrick was critical of the team\u2019s plan to play him as an in-the-box defender instead of in coverage.\n\nThe Steelers will have Fitzpatrick under contract for the rest of this season and three more, should they choose, and at below-market rates for a highly regarded defensive back. Fitzpatrick has salaries of $1.9 million in 2020, $2.7 million in 2021 and a fifth-year option in 2022.\n\nMiami is setting itself up to be a major player in upcoming drafts. The Dolphins have three first-round picks and two second-rounders in 2020. They also have two first-rounders and two second-rounders in 2021.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Minkah Fitzpatrick got his wish, and the Miami Dolphins landed another first-round pick in a trade with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430869959&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G15Z-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
