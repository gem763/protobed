Peretz, IAA / SWNS.com)\n\nAfter six years of extensive archaeological excavations, researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority and Tel Aviv University have uncovered a 220 metre-long section of an ancient street\n\nThe walkway ascends from the Pool of Siloam in the south to the Temple Mount.\n\nBoth monuments are hugely significant to followers of Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThe Temple Mount, located within the Old City of Jerusalem, has been venerated as a holy site for thousands of years.\n\nAt the time of the street's construction, it is where Jesus is said to have cured a man's blindness by sending him to wash in the Siloam Pool.\n\nThe excavation revealed more than 100 coins trapped beneath paving stones.\n\nThe latest coins were dated between 17AD and 31AD, which provides firm evidence that work began and was completed during the time that Pilate governed Judea.\n\nStudy co-author Dr Donald Ariel, an archaeologist and coin expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: \"Dating using coins is very exact.\n\n(Image: D. Levi, IAA / SWNS.com)\n\n\"As some coins have the year in which they were minted on them, what that means is that if a coin with the date on it is found beneath the street, the street had to be built in the same year or after that coin had been minted, so any time after.\n\n\"However, our study goes further, because statistically, coins minted some 10 years later are the most common coins in Jerusalem, so not having them beneath the street means the street was built before their appearance, in other words only in the time of Pilate.\"\n\nThe street - 600 metres long and around eight metres wide - was paved with large stone slabs, as was customary throughout the Roman Empire.\n\nThe researchers estimate that some 10,000 tons of quarried limestone rock was used in its construction, which the research team say would have required considerable skill.\n\nThe opulent and grand nature of the street coupled with the fact that it links two of the most important spots in Jerusalem - the Siloam Pool and Temple Mount - is strong evidence that the street acted as a pilgrim's route.\n\nCo-author Dr Joe Uziel, of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: \"If this was a simple walkway connecting point A to point B, there would be no need to build such a grand street.\n\n\"At its minimum it is eight metres wide. This, coupled with its finely carved stone and ornate 'furnishings' like a stepped podium along the street, all indicate that this was a special street.\"\n\n(Image: M. Hagbi, IAA / SWNS.com)\n\nStudy author Nahshon Szanton added: \"Part of it may have been to appease the residents of Jerusalem, part of it may have been about the way Jerusalem would fit in the Roman world, and part of it may have been to aggrandize his name through major building projects.\"\n\nThe paving stones of the street were found hidden beneath layers of rubble, thought to be from when the Romans captured and destroyed the city in 70AD.\n\nThe rubble contained weapons, including arrowheads and sling stones, remains of burnt trees, and collapsed stones from the buildings along its edge.\n\nThe researchers say it is possible that Pilate had the street built to reduce tensions with the Jewish population.\n\nDr Ariel added:\"We can't know for sure, although all these reasons do find support in the historical documents.\"\n\nThe study was published in Tel Aviv: Journal of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University.", "description": "Researchers also found more than 100 coins beneath the paving stones that date the street to around the year 31AD", "authors": ["Stephen Beech", "Neil Murphy", "Image", "Getty Images", "A.
