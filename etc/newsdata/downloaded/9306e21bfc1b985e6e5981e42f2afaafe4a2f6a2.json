How many? Six million.\n\nWith A-Class, the German luxury vehicle brand has been able to capture a much younger audience and now the local product portfolio has been bolstered by the addition of Mercedes-Benz\u2019s latest A-Class sedan and CLA coupe.\n\nREAD | How the Mercedes-Benz A-Class went from Smart car lookalike to the most complete hatch on the market\n\nAlthough both vehicles ride on the brand\u2019s new fourth-generation A-Class platform, the CLA coupe is longer, lower and wider by 139mm, 7mm and 34mm.\n\nDifferentiating the A-Class sedan and CLA in terms of appearance are larger headlights on the latter and a bonnet with two pinch lines. Around the rear, the CLA also features reshaped taillights, more akin to the aft illumination found on Mercedes-Benz\u2019s new CLS.\n\nCustomers have a choice of wheel sizes, but Mercedes-Benz has decided upon a 17-inch alloy wheel as the default and truth be told: those are perfect for local conditions, providing adequate air volume and tyre sidewall to roll through potholes without harm. If you wish, there are 18- and 19-inch diameter alloy rim options too.\n\nMBUX as standard\n\nThe A-Class sedan and CLA both feature Mercedes-Benz\u2019s MBUX digital assistant and cabin infotainment as standard, whereas this remains an optional extra on the A-Class hatchback. Dual 7-inch infotainment screens relay all relevant information, and there is the option to upsize those to 10.25-inches.\n\nNoise insulation and vibration damping is good but the MBUX system remains an exercise in frustration when using voice commands. This is not an issue isolated to Mercedes-Benz.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nAll voice-prompted digital cabin assistants have a very low execution rate on commands and the automotive industry appears unable to deliver a solution which can offer users a seamless experience.\n\nThe absence of metal and flood of average plastics are also an issue that has plagued A-Class since its inception and even on these latest variants, you don\u2019t really feel that promise of scaled-down Mercedes-Benz quality.\n\nPracticality is good, with the A-Class sedan spacing boot capacity of 420-litres. Amazingly, the CLA coupe has better boot space than its sedan sibling, with 460-litres, which compensates for the slightly tapered rear passenger headroom in the sloping roofline A-Class.\n\nPotent 2.0-litre performance\n\nMechanically the new A-Class sedan offers two engines, both of which will be familiar to A-Class hatchback owners: a turbocharged 1.33-litre and boosted 2.0-litre. The smaller engine is good for 120kW and 250Nm, whilst the 2.0-litre capacity turbo motor registers 165kW and 350Nm.\n\nThe only traction configuration is front-wheel drive and both the A200 and A250 Sport tempo speed and economy via Mercedes-Benz\u2019s agile and intuitive seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nAs a driving experience, these latest A-Class offerings are thoroughly convincing. The W177 structure has enabled Mercedes-Benz engineers to deliver a wonderfully adaptable driving experience.\n\nRide quality and handling dynamics are thoroughly representative of the best Mercedes-Benz values and you never feel you are piloting a compact front-wheel-drive car, except when enjoying the parking convenience of its smallish exterior dimensions.\n\nMercedes-Benz is anticipating customer migration within its own product ladder, with those buyers who ordinarily would have considered a C-Class, now reassessing the value offering and considering A-Class sedan ownership.\n\nWhat about the coupe?\n\nCLA is a more niche offering. Mercedes-Benz\u2019s marketing research predicts an 80% conquest rate, with most of its customers for the sloping roofline A-Class being new converts to the brand.\n\nCuriously the CLA, which is the more strikingly styled car and should appeal to a customer who values dynamics, is only being marketed with the smaller petrol engine and a diesel powerplant as its lead.\n\nThe CLA 220d is powered by Mercedes-Benz\u2019s 2-litre turbodiesel, producing 140kW and 400Nm. It is credibly swift and highway cruising economy should gift it very generous range, but surely the 165kW 2-litre turbo-petrol would be a more appropriate specification?\n\nIn a world where the traditional sedan configuration has been displaced by crossovers, SUVs and hatchbacks the A-Class sedan and CLA are almost peculiar products. But in the South African context, they serve a very specific purpose.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nThe reality of having a lockable boot space for laptops and valuable items is a uniquely South African security concern. For those customers who don\u2019t desire to take their laptops, or an activity bag, with them each time they park their vehicle, the A-Class sedan and CLA offer a more convenient overall ownership experience than any comparable hatchback or SUV, which a glass section tailgate.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nPricing for the new A-Class sedan starts at R533 500, which gets you an A200. If you\u2019d prefer that mechanical specification in CLA, the price rises to R570 500.\n\nMercedes-Benz\u2019s A-Class A250 is positioned at R604 800, whilst the CLA 220d trades at a slight premium to that, retailing for R612 800. Mercedes-Benz has confirmed that its AMG 35-series derivatives of the new A-Class sedan and CLA will be introduced locally, in due course.", "description": "'With A-Class, Mercedes-Benz has been able to capture a much younger audience and now the local product portfolio has been bolstered by the addition of the latest A-Class sedan and CLA coupe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9446/2a36f51ae38f424e80af7ef488941188.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
