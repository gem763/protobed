They say luck favours the prepared; the trio had perused the sample questions beforehand, and were feeling fairly confident about their prospects.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a feeling shared by everyone. As the preliminary round began, the cheerful commotion in the room died down, replaced by furious scribbles, interrupted only by the occasional groan from a frustrated student. Seeing their looks of desperation, the quizmaster urged the students to make \u201cintelligent guesses\u201d.\n\nChristopher (top, from left), Crystal and Conrad were the event\u2019s winners, but it was a rewarding day for all the students.

The students began to relax. By the time the quiz got to the History and Ancient Civilisations round, participants were shooting off their seats to get a closer look at the pictures on the screen.\n\nStill, only six teams could go through to the intense buzzer round \u2013 one of the highlights of the day. With points deducted for any wrong answer given, the pressure was on for the finalists.\n\nHow one Hong Kong designer is keeping the traditional craft of crochet alive\n\nBut the pressure wasn\u2019t enough to stop the Renaissance College team \u2013 made up of Christopher Wong 17, Crystal Pun, 15, and Conrad Helau, also 15 \u2013 from claiming the championship title.\n\nThey were followed by Kiangsu-Chekiang College and Hong Kong International School in second and third place respectively.\n\nChristopher said the team\u2019s winning strategy was to have \u201cno strategy\u201d. As surprising as it may seem, this approach to Mind Over Matter usually pays off better than having lots of complicated tactics, which only pile on the pressure.\n\nLife as an asylum seeker in Hong Kong: The harsh realities of waiting for official refugee status in the city\n\n\u201cAll that is needed is good team work,\u201d said Christopher. \u201cThat way, you can have open discussions that will help you reach an answer.\u201d\n\nIt may be billed as a competition, but Mind Over Matter really serves as a reminder that learning should be fun, not something we are forced to do to get good grades. Long may this annual tradition continue.\n\nEdited by Charlotte Ames-Ettridge", "description": "Champion Renaissance College's secret formula for success: teamwork", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/4995fcc6-f932-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15imagehires135407.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
