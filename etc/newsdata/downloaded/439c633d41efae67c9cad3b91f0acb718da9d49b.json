Any controversial flags or other similar banners or signs with symbols of hatred, divisiveness and/or intolerance whether intentional or otherwise will not be permitted in our stadiums. Period.\u201d\n\nThe news comes after Nike recently pulled a line of sneakers that featured the Betsy Ross flag after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick reportedly complained about its possible connections to slavery.\n\nMs. Scott said it was Nike\u2019s decision that drove her to buy the flag when she saw it at the store one day.\n\n\u201cIt just kind of bothered me that [Nike was] going to take it away,\u201d she told the Fox affiliate. \u201cIt\u2019s a great flag, and I love it.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
