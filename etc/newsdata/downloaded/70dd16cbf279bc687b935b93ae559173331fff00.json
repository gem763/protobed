State and national findings appear to indicate that products bought on the street or from family, friends, dealers or other informal sources \u201care linked to most of the cases and play a major role in the outbreak,\u201d the CDC said in its latest report.\n\nHowever, at present, health officials remain unable to identify a single product as the culprit across all cases, and \u201cmany different substances and product sources are still under investigation.\u201d\n\nCertain patients used only products containing nicotine, meaning the CDC cannot rule out the possibility that such products are playing a role in the illnesses.\n\nLast week, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study by a team of Mayo Clinic doctors who suspect that noxious chemical fumes are behind the outbreak as patients\u2019 conditions have parallels to those who have been exposed to toxic agents and poisonous gases.\n\n\u201cWe were not surprised by what we found, regarding toxicity,\u201d said Dr. Larsen, the study\u2019s senior author, in a statement. \u201cWe have seen a handful of cases, scattered individual cases, over the past two years where we\u2019ve observed the same thing, and now we are seeing a sudden spike in cases.\u201d\n\nStates including Michigan and New York have instated temporary bans on the sale of flavored vaping products, while Massachusetts took its temporary ban a step further, prohibiting both flavored and non-flavored items, in addition to any containing marijuana and THC.\n\nOregon is set to implement its own temporary ban on flavored products next week.\n\nOn Monday, Walgreens and Kroger announced that their stores would remove e-cigarettes from the shelves, following Walmart\u2019s decision to do the same last month over \u201cregulatory complexity and uncertainty.\u201d", "description": "As the death toll rises, health officials suspect products containing THC are a major factor.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da0cca1200000d4065000a2.jpeg?cache=ihqbcfyn2a&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
