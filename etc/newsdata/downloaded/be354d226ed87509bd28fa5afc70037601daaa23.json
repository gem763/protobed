Photo: Mike Coppola/Getty Images\n\nDavid Brooks fears for his republic. The New York Times\u2019 senior \u201creasonable conservative\u201d columnist is alarmed by the tenor of America\u2019s political debate. To his right, he sees ideologues with an allergy to all nuance and ambiguity; to his left, he sees the same. Such fanatics view politics as a Manichaean fairy tale, in which their side lays exclusive claim to wisdom, sanity, and righteousness. Only their ideological faction can save this fallen nation from itself. It is not their desire to triumph over their enemies and consolidate power over our government \u2014 it is their destiny.\n\nFortunately, there is one ideological faction that still upholds America\u2019s founding ideals, tolerates moral complexity, and rejects Manichaean thinking \u2014 \u201cmoderate liberals\u201d like David Brooks. And, in a new column, Brooks declares that his comrades are destined to triumph over their extremist enemies, and consolidate power over our government.\n\n\u201cA Brief History of the Elizabeth Warren Presidency\u201d begins as an exercise in playful punditry. Looking back from the year 2050, Brooks explains how the Massachusetts senator elbowed past her primary rivals on the strength of her \u201cself-awareness\u201d and high levels of support in Iowa and New Hampshire. Warren proved too progressive to become a popular Democratic nominee, Brooks continues, but this scarcely mattered \u2014 2020 was a referendum on Donald Trump\u2019s white identity politics, and a historically diverse U.S. electorate rejected Trumpism resoundingly.\n\nOnce Warren enters the White House, however, her fortunes turn south \u2014 and Brooks\u2019s punditry turns to preaching. Warren\u2019s entire agenda fails in the Senate, as red-state Democrats inform the president that supporting her \u201cwealth tax\u201d would be politically \u201csuicidal\u201d (the idea that this policy is toxic in red states is contradicted by all available polling data, and Brooks does not bother to substantiate his prediction). A recession hits. Blue America descends into civil war. And then, the meek center-right columnists inherit the Earth \u2014 or at least, the Democratic Party. Pluralistic toleration reigns throughout the land.\n\nNow, as someone who wishes to see the United States become a racially egalitarian, social democratic (and/or market socialist) society that serves as a safe harbor for the oppressed of all nations, I don\u2019t begrudge anyone their political daydreams. The trouble here isn\u2019t that Brooks predicts the final victory of the concern-trolling class, but the way he characterizes his ideological adversaries while doing so:\n\nBefore Warren, people thought of liberals and progressives as practically synonymous. After Warren, it was clear they were different, with different agendas and different national narratives. Moderate liberals had a basic faith in American institutions and thought they just needed reform. They had basic faith in capitalism and the Constitution and revered the classical liberal philosophy embedded in America\u2019s founding. They inherited Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass\u2019s millennial nationalism, a sense that America has a special destiny as the last best hope of earth. Progressives had much less faith in American institutions \u2014 in capitalism, the Constitution, the founding. They called for more structural change to things like the Supreme Court, the Electoral College and the basic structures of the market. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 had served for them as proof that racism is the dominant note in American history, that the founding was 1619, not 1776. They were willing to step on procedural liberalism in order to get radical change \u2026 The moderate liberals triumphed easily. It turns out that the immigrant groups, by then a large and organized force in American politics, had not lost faith in the American dream, they had not lost faith in capitalism. They simply wanted more help so they could compete within it.\n\nHere, Brooks evinces disapproval of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s call to abolish the Electoral College, her openness to reforming the Supreme Court, and her plans for restructuring the American economy. But he does not bother to engage her arguments on any of these points, or explain why he finds them misguided. Instead, he is content to merely code them as anti-capitalist, illiberal, and un-American; which is to say, as betrayals of our republic\u2019s finest founding ideals, and the political legacies of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.\n\nEarlier this month, Brooks wrote a column from the perspective of his fanatical detractors on the \u201calt right\u201d and \u201calt left.\u201d Here is an abridged version of how he characterized their worldview:\n\nI yearn for order. Blunt simplicities. Politics provides the Manichaean binaries I can\u2019t find anywhere else \u2026 I need leaders and spokesmen who will never show uncertainty. I want leaders who tell simple blame stories \u2026 So, my politics is not really about issues \u2026 I don\u2019t deal with the complexities of economics or foreign affairs \u2026 I am indignant. I am superior.\n\nThis seems like a fair description of Brooks\u2019s own politics, at least, as expressed in his critique of Warren. The Massachusetts senator has not condemned America\u2019s political and economic institutions as valueless and worthy of destruction. She describes herself as \u201ccapitalist to my bones,\u201d and sings paens to the glories of market competition. As for her attitude toward U.S. nationalism, the official title of her trade agenda is \u201cA Plan for Economic Patriotism.\u201d She has (problematically) named Teddy Roosevelt as her personal hero. Her stump speeches are routinely framed around retellings of inspirational episodes from American history. \u201cOur nation\u2019s basic institutions are sound and full of promise, they just need to be reformed\u201d is, more or less, the candidate\u2019s message.\n\nBut Brooks demands blunt simplicities. He isn\u2019t interested in the \u201ccomplexities of economics,\u201d so he does not bother to elucidate the distinction between Warren\u2019s desire for (in his words) \u201cstructural change to \u2026 the basic structures of the market,\u201d and his own interest in reforming American capitalism to help immigrants better compete. The intensity of Warren\u2019s dissatisfaction with our increasingly inequitable economy \u2014 and anti-democratic political system \u2014 challenges his belief that \u201cAmerica has a special destiny as the last best hope of earth\u201d (which is in no way a fanatical or immoderate thing to believe). And moderate liberals (apparently) cannot tolerate such uncertainty. They yearn for order, and Manichaean binaries. If you believe in the Constitution, then you cannot support amending it. After all, the Electoral College operates exactly how its founders intended; therefore, any changes to our system of electing presidents wouldn\u2019t represent another chapter in a long history of reform, but rather, a radical break with the American way. Similarly, the Supreme Court has always had nine justices. And the basic structures of America\u2019s market economy have never undergone changes as sweeping as those that Elizabeth Warren has prescribed: From the time of the Declaration\u2019s signing until today, American capitalism has always been known for its transnational tech and finance oligopolies, rapidly shrinking middle class, and low levels of social mobility. Thus, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that anyone calling for drastic changes to America\u2019s status quo political economy must reject its foundational ideals (which are too self-evident and uncontentious to require definition). And surely, no politician who calls herself a liberal \u2014 in the American sense \u2014 would ever entertain increasing the number of justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nOne could write another 1,000 words on the fallacies and hypocrisies Brooks has constructed his column (and political identity) atop. But there wouldn\u2019t be much point. His politics is not really about issues. He is indignant. He is superior.", "description": "The New York Times senior \u201creasonable conservative\u201d columnist laments the uncivil tenor of America\u2019s political discourse \u2013and the anti-American radicalism of anyone to his left \u2013 in a new column about Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": ["Eric Levitz"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/20/20-david-brooks.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
