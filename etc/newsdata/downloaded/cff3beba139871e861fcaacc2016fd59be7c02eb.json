This would allow third parties outside the banking system to initiate payment instructions and make it easier for a customer to move banks.\n\nThese are policies, it suggests, that will lift competition, attract more venture capital to Australia and create more jobs and technology exports.\n\nThe Senate select committee into financial and regulatory technology, announced last month, reckon these niches of the technology industry could provide the \u201cnext wave of employment growth\u201d for the economy.\n\nIt will examine policy settings and culture in Singapore, the UK, and Israel to ensure Australia is globally competitive, in a world where financial services are being redefined by forces of digitisation.\n\n\u201cFintech is central to ensuring Australia remains a nation that creates employment and technology creates new opportunities,\u201d says an issues paper published by the committee, which is being headed by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg.\n\nThe committee wants to co-ordinate tax and investment policy, skills and regulation to reduce the barriers for new technologies to emerge in the financial sector.\n\nSingling out software giant Atlassian and \"buy now, pay later\" leader Afterpay, the issues paper says the government wants to support the international expansion of other start-ups.\n\nThis comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said it would look into the \"buy now, pay later\" sector and consider allowing retailers to pass some of the costs of the service to customers, which Afterpay currently prevents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe committee has also pointed to potential problems with the open banking policy, to come into operation on February 1.\n\nFintech Australia has advised the committee it could cost between $50,000 and $100,000 a year for a start-up to maintain accreditation to receive banking information under the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) rules on open banking, a large sum for a start-up with merely an idea.\n\nScraping alternative\n\nThe issues paper suggests that \u2018\u2018screen scraping\u2019\u2019 \u2013 the method fintechs use to access banking data, after receiving customer passwords \u2013 will continue to remain an alternative, and could therefore depress volumes of start-ups using open banking. This focus could put pressure on the ACCC to lower accreditation fees.\n\n\u2018\u2018For many fintech companies, the cost, time and effort to become accredited and maintain the CDR \u2018rails\u2019 does not make sense, given screen scraping rails already exist and are relatively less complex to access for new fintech companies,\u2019\u2019 the paper says.\n\nThe inquiry will also examine \u2018\u2018smart money\u2019\u2019, or programmable digital money, which would be used to link spending under the National Disability Insurance Scheme to particular services to reduce fraud rates. It will also look at access to the RBA-backed \u2018\u2018new payments platform\u2019\u2019, which has been criticised by the Productivity Commission, and the recent extension of ASIC\u2019s \u2018\u2018regulatory sandbox\u2019\u2019, which helps start-ups get financial services licences.\n\nRebecca Schot-Guppy, the general manager of FinTech Australia, described the committee's paper as a \"watershed moment\" and \"first step towards a national fintech agenda\".\n\n\"We strongly support the widening of the consumer data right to include other financial services areas, such as superannuation,\" she said. \"We believe widening the regime will ensure this policy has a greater impact on competition and will see consumers overall better off.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inquiry will also examine government procurement policies to encourage engagement with start-ups and it wants to explore how incumbents can collaborate to increase productivity. The committee says it\u2019s not just about start-ups \u2013 all businesses need to innovate.\n\nIt invites submissions to address \u201cto what extent should government encourage or incentivise the disruption of existing financial services business models by new market entrants as opposed to promoting partnerships between new and incumbent players\u201d.\n\nThe number of people using fintech services in Australia has gone from 13 per cent in 2015 to 58 per cent in 2019, according to EY. But Australia receives only a small slice of the overall global fintech investment \u2013 it accounted for just $US100 million ($145 million) out of $US$38 billion globally in the first half of this year, according to KPMG.\n\nThe deadline for submissions is December 31.", "description": "A Senate inquiry into fintech will consider allowing consumers to more easily transfer their superannuation data to a new fund and let start-ups control payments without banks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1999%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_11%2C$y_40/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/64b8b536bdb7f92aeeca173758304025138f7031", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
