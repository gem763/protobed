They will then find themselves in the eye of an unexpected storm.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. action to further curb Iranian oil exports signaled the administration\u2019s commitment to its \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign as European allies and other nations push Washington to ease sanctions and cool rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran.\n\nWith Cosco caught in the crossfire, tense ties between Washington and Beijing will be further strained as the two superpowers clash over trade, security and a host of other topics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling China and all nations: Know that we will sanction every violation of sanctionable activity,\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.\n\nA Cosco executive who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media, said the U.S. hit \u201ccame out of the blue\u201d as far as the carrier was concerned.\n\n\u201cYou never know where President Trump will hit next,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very unfair to tell ports, booking agents and other parties that they will be punished if they work with Cosco ships. We are not involved in any illicit oil movement.\u201d\n\nShipping brokers say Iranian tankers often turn off their identification signals at night and transship oil to other tankers at sea.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a common practice off Borneo or the waters around Malaysia,\u201d the Singapore broker said. \u201cThe ships then move towards China, but we haven\u2019t heard of any Cosco ships being part of this.\u201d\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani called the U.S. campaign \u201cmerciless economic terrorism\u201d and said his government wouldn\u2019t negotiate with the U.S. unless Washington lifted the sanctions.\n\nThe new steps are among an escalating series of sanctions that have battered Iran\u2019s economy but have not yet persuaded Tehran to accede to U.S. demands to negotiate a new nuclear and security pact.\n\nChina, as the biggest remaining buyer of Iran\u2019s crude, has so far resisted U.S. attempts to halt its consumption of the Mideastern country\u2019s supply.\n\nChina imported 788,000 tons of crude from Iran in August, according to Chinese customs data, compared with a monthly average of 2.4 million tons last year.\n\nBig ship owners from countries like Greece that control about a quarter of the global tanker fleet said they have stopped doing business with Iran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been loading Iranian oil for the past 25 years, but with the Americans breathing down your neck, it\u2019s not worth the risk,\u201d a Greek owner who runs around 15 tankers said. \u201cIf you are caught, you pay a heavy fine and can\u2019t do business in the U.S., which is now a big oil exporter.\u201d\n\nChina strongly opposes the U.S. blacklisting its companies and has consistently pushed back against the latest U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. disregards the legitimate rights and interests of all parties and arbitrarily wields the stick of sanctions,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing on Thursday. \u201cIt is a gross violation of the basic norms of international relations.\u201d\n\n\u2014Joanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "description": "Chinese state shipping behemoth Cosco Shipping Holdings Co. halted trading of shares in its oil transport unit as it tries to contain the fallout from the U.S. blacklisting of its tankers for allegedly moving illicit Iranian oil.", "authors": ["Costas Paris", "Costas.Paris Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-111171/social", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
