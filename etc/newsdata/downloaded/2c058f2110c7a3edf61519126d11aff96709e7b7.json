If we can change from a paper-based system that takes months [to process] and often doesn't give feedback ... it will change behavior.\"\n\n\u2014 Kenneth Staley, U.S. global malaria coordinator, President's Malaria Initiative\n\n\"How do you operationalize countries that are high burden but [have] low standards?\"\n\n\u2014 Stephen Morrison, SVP and director, CSIS Global Health Policy Center\n\n\"Already governments are putting more money into malaria ... That requires a whole-of-government approach to looking at financing, from increasing tax revenues to allocating more money to health. ... [But] there must be political will, where the leaders [can] make these tough choices.\"\n\n\u2014 Muhammad Pate, global director of health, nutrition and population, World Bank\n\n\"We have great tools today. They are not perfect, but if we could just maximize the ones we have today ... we could save millions of lives.\"\n\n\u2014 Robert Newman, director of AMP Health, The Aspen Institute\n\nMeanwhile, research is ongoing for possible targets in gene-editing or drug development, like two studies that developed a tool and a cell atlas to help map out the genes of some of the parasites, and looking at a possible TCMDC-135051 inhibitor.\n\nWHO says a \"landmark vaccine\" pilot has been launched in Kenya, Ghana and Malawi, although the Mosquirix (RTS,S) vaccine made by GlaxoSmithKline is said to provide limited protection.\n\nWhat we're watching: How the Global Fund, which is one of the main malaria funders, does in its current drive to get $14 billion in funding for malaria, TB and HIV when it's facing some donor fatigue.\n\nGo deeper:", "description": "The Global Fund is seeking billions to help fight the disease, which kills a child every 2 minutes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Z6y_8Hs5MtRCRI9P9lcNKHJflIs=/0x0:6720x3780/1920x1080/2019/09/23/1569238901234.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
