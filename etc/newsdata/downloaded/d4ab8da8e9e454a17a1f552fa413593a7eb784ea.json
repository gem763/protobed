After losing about 3% over Tuesday and Wednesday, the S&P 500 .SPX on Friday logged its biggest one-day gain since Aug. 16, thanks in part to a late-session surge.\n\nStill, for a third consecutive week the Dow and S&P 500 lost ground.\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s report showed nonfarm payrolls increased by 136,000 last month and the unemployment rate dropped to a 50-year low, but manufacturing payrolls declined for the first time in six months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a Goldilocks report: it\u2019s not strong enough to move the Federal Reserve away from cutting rates at the end of October, but it\u2019s not weak enough to make you concerned about the labor market or the consumer,\u201d said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management in New York.\n\nBets that the Fed will cut interest rates have surged this week after a dramatic contraction in U.S. manufacturing, cooling private sector hiring, and a fall in service sector activity pointed to widening fallout from the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nTraders see a 77.5% chance that the central bank will lower borrowing costs at its policy meeting later this month, up from 40% on Monday. The Fed cut rates in September for the second time this year and said future reductions would be \u201cdata-dependent.\u201d\n\nWith fears related to the trade war and its effect on the U.S. economy weighing on sentiment, the S&P 500 is up 2% over the past 12 months, and about 2% off its record high close in July.\n\n\u201cAlthough market participants have been selling stocks and buying bonds, at the end of the day you say, \u2018Gee, I still have to have some return for my investment, and that\u2019s going to come from stocks,\u2019\u201d said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments.\n\nApple Inc (AAPL.O) shares rose 2.8% after a report that the company would ramp up production of iPhone 11 models.\n\nThe S&P information technology index .SPLRCT climbed 1.7%, while the Philadelphia chip index .SOX advanced 1.9%.\n\nAll 11 major sector indexes rose, led by a 1.9% jump in the S&P financials .SPSY.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI jumped 1.42% to close at 26,573.72 points, while the S&P 500 .SPX also surged 1.42%, finishing at 2,952.01.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 1.4% to end at 7,982.47.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was light at 5.9 billion shares, compared with the 7.3 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\n\nFor the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.3%, the Dow lost 0.9% and the Nasdaq added 0.5%.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 3, 2019.
