The 76ers had fouled Young before he could attempt a tying 3, but the Hawks wound up getting the points they needed when Al Horford failed to block out Collins, who flexed both arms on his way back down the court.\n\nAfter a timeout, Horford made up for his mistake by lobbing a pass to Embiid breaking free in the lane. Collins fouled the 76ers big man before he could get off the shot, but Embiid calmly knocked down both free throws.\n\nThe Hawks had one final chance, getting the ball to 42-year-old Vince Carter sprinting along the sideline. He threw up a wild 3 that never had a chance, bouncing off the top of the backboard as the horn sounded.\n\nTobias Harris had eight of his 13 points in the final quarter as the 76ers outscored the Hawks 15-5 over the final five minutes. Josh Richardson chipped in with 14 points, and Ben Simmons also had 14.\n\nBut this was all about Embiid, who made 12 of 19 shots from the field \u2014 including a couple of 3s \u2014 and knocked down all 10 of his free throws. He also had 13 rebounds, five assists and three steals.\n\nYoung, the first Eastern Conference player of the week for the season, had 25 points but was held to 7-of-20 shooting. Collins added 16 points and De\u2019Andre Hunter 14, including a 3 from the corner that gave the Hawks a 98-90 lead. Philadelphia dominating the rest of the way.\n\nYoung averaged 38.5 points in Atlanta\u2019s first two games.\n\nTIP-INS\n\n76ers: Former Hawk Mike Scott was ejected in the second quarter for a flagrant foul on Atlanta\u2019s Damian Jones. Scott gave Jones a chest bump as the Hawks center was driving to the basket, sending him out of bounds. While the play didn\u2019t look especially egregious, officials upheld the call after checking the replay. Scott shook hands with Jones before leaving the court, stopping on his way to the locker room to give his wrist bands to young fans hanging over the railing. \u2026 Embiid was a game-time decision after missing one game with an ankle injury. He certainly didn\u2019t look to be in any pain.\n\nHawks: No. 10 overall draft pick Cam Reddish hasn\u2019t made much of an impact in his first three NBA games. He has a total of 11 points. \u2026 Carter played only 10 minutes but was on the court for key minutes down the stretch. \u2026 Rookie C Bruno Fernando had the first double-figure scoring game of his career with 11 points.\n\nUP NEXT\n\n76ers: Return home to face Minnesota on Wednesday before heading out on a West Coast road trip.\n\nHawks: Head straight to Miami for the first of a home-and-home with the Heat on Tuesday. The division rivals meet again Thursday in Atlanta.\n\n___\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 His work can be found at https://apnews.com\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "description": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Joel Embiid scored 36 points, including the winning free throws with 5.3 seconds left, and the Philadelphia 76ers won their third straight", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/28/f7e9cc_76ers-hawks-basketball-59629-joel-embiid-vince-carter-philadelphia-76ers-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
