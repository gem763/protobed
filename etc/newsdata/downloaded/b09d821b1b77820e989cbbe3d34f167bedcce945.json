He noted that while those resolutions wouldn't be put to shareholders because a special resolution they were reliant on wasn't passed, the issues would be open for discussion.\n\nQuestions were dominated by concerns voiced over the climate and land impact of Origin's drilling and fracking project in the Beetaloo Basin, with several traditional owners from land near the area voicing vehement opposition and claiming Origin did not have the informed consent of native title holders.\n\n\"For you it is a resource to make money,\" one said. \"For us it is our spirit, it is our songline, our ceremony, our life; it is our identity for who we are.\"\n\nIn response, Mr Cairns declared that Origin's exploration for gas in the NT \"will not destroy land or poison water\", saying it would not be planning the work were that the case.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrigin has consistently argued that it is advised by the Northern Land Council as to the traditional owners in the Beetaloo Basin, and it has the consent of those parties.\n\nEarlier, chief executive Frank Calabria voiced concerns about a decade lost to \"inertia on climate policy\", reiterating worries spelt out at The Australian Financial Review National Energy Summit last week.\n\nHe said Origin still has \"major concerns\" that the Morrison government's proposed \"big stick\" legislation, which could force the break-up of integrated energy suppliers and which Labor on Tuesday finally agreed to support, will \"result in worse rather than better outcomes\".\n\n\"Our concern remains that interventionist policies of this nature, and the risk of unintended consequences, will not make energy more affordable nor ensure greater reliability,\" Mr Calabria said.\n\nMr Calabria confirmed Origin's outlook for profit in 2019-20, reiterating that relied on no further adverse impacts from the regulatory and political environment. That involves underlying earnings from the core energy markets business of between $1.35 billion and $1.45 billion. The integrated gas business, which includes the Australia Pacific LNG export project in Queensland, is expected to break even in terms of paying distributions to Origin at between $US33 and $US36 per barrel of oil equivalent of production.", "description": "Chairman Gordon Cairns has backed Origin Energy's stance on emissions reduction and social governance.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.211%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_64/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d4d608f1e0b66c9e955e6f38420339ac47d124d8", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
