It would eclipse the 2014 listing of Alibaba which raised $25bn.\n\nAramco sits on 263 billion barrels of crude oil and 320 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, much more than any other private or state oil company, and the firm reports impressive earnings.\n\n\"But Riyadh's apparent desire for a valuation of $2 trillion could still be difficult to justify,\" said Russ Mould, director at Bell Investment.\n\nThe company's expected dividend yield is well below those offered by most of the world's major oil firms, Mould said.\n\nThe Saudi government has not given any explanation for the IPO delays, but apart from holding out for the big-ticket valuation, it is also said to be concerned the listing could bring intense legal scrutiny of the secretive company's finances and inner workings.", "description": "Aramco IPO is the cornerstone of a reform programme conceived by Crown Prince <span>Mohammed bin Salman</span>.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/26/e20c5a00946e40a186bc1efcdfd7736c_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
