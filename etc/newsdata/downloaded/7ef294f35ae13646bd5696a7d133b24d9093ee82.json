According to Variety, Nevils told Farrow that Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room while they were on assignment covering the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nNevils told Farrow that Lauer pushed her onto the bed and asked if she liked anal sex. She told him no, but then Nevils says he \u201cjust did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils is reported to have told Farrow. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d\n\nIn his response to the accusations, Lauer vigorously denied that the relationship with Nevils was without her explicit consent.\n\n\u201cDespite my desire to set the record straight and confront the individuals making false allegations, I wanted nothing less than to create more headlines my kids would read and a new gathering of photographers at the end of our driveway,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut my silence has been a mistake. Today, nearly two years after I was fired by NBC, old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made.\u201d\n\nLauer then goes on to call the new allegation about raping Nevils \u201coutrageous\u201d and writes that it is \u201cbeing spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book.\u201d\n\nHe says he asked his family for support to address the matter publicly, which he was granted.\n\n\u201cIn a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having, was in fact an assault,\u201d the former Today host writes. \u201cIt is categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense.\u201d\n\nLauer then explains how his extramarital affair with Nevils began when she came to his hotel room \u201cvery late one night\u201d in Sochi, Russia, in 2014. He says the two \u201cengaged in a variety of sexual acts.\u201d\n\nTo explain further, he gives the following details: \u201cWe performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex.\u201d\n\nHe says, \u201cEach act was mutual and completely consensual.\u201d\n\nThe next lines of the letter directly accuse the woman who went on to file a complaint to NBC News about his alleged sexual abuse of being a liar, saying the story Nevils tells \u201cis filled with false details intended only to create the impression this was an abusive encounter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere was absolutely nothing aggressive about that encounter. Brooke did not do or say anything to object. She certainly did not cry.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to call her a \u201cfully enthusiastic and willing partner\u201d and that she never showed that she was not capable of giving her full consent.\n\n\u201cShe seemed to know exactly what she wanted to do,\u201d Lauer insists. \u201cThe only concern she expressed was that someone might see her leaving my room. She embraced me at the door as she left. This encounter, which she now falsely claims was an assault, was the beginning of our affair.\u201d\n\nLauer then outlines the timeline of their continuing affair, which he says lasted for the next several months, outlining one alleged sexual encounter in his dressing room at NBC\u2019s studios.\n\n\u201cIt showed terrible judgment on my part, but it was completely mutual and consensual,\u201d Lauer writes. He says Nevils\u2019 fears over control of her career were unfounded because she did not work for him or the Today show or for NBC News. \u201cShe worked for Meredith Vieira (who had not worked for the Today show in several years) in a completely different part of the network, and I had no role in reviewing Brooke\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nContinuing to blame his accuser, he makes one admission. \u201cI admit, I ended the affair poorly. I simply stopped communicating with her,\u201d he writes. \u201cBrooke continued to reach out.\u201d\n\nLauer goes on to say that she had tried several times to rekindle the affair, even calling him late at night when he was with his family.\n\n\u201cBut I attempted to go back to my life and pretend as if nothing had happened. I understand how that must have made her feel,\u201d he writes, before again accusing her of making false accusations behind his back despite being friendly to him on many occasions to his face.\n\nHe says it was not until he was called in to speak to an NBC attorney in November 2017 that he says he first learned of Nevils\u2019 complaint. He says she then asked NBC for money and that she was trying to sell a book and that he could not defend himself at the time because she insisted on remaining anonymous.\n\n\u201cBut Brooke\u2019s story is filled with contradictions,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich Brooke is to be believed?\u201d\n\nLauer then goes on to explain how he has \u201cbrought more pain and embarrassment to my family than most people can ever begin to understand,\u201d which he says he has worked to fix. He also calls on friends and colleagues who knew of the affair to come forward. \u201cI hope those people will understand that these allegations cross a serious line, and what they can share is a vital truth even if it may seem unpopular.\u201d\n\nHe says that by not speaking out he \u201cemboldened those who continue to do me harm with false stories.\u201d He also seeks to clarify stories that he had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock the door without getting up. \u201cDespite numerous erroneous reports in the past, there was not a button in my office that could lock the door from the inside,\u201d he writes. \u201cThere was no such locking mechanism. It didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nHe ends the lengthy letter with a final swing.\n\n\u201cFor two years, the women with whom I had extramarital relationships have abandoned shared responsibility, and instead, shielded themselves from blame behind false allegations,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey have avoided having to look a boyfriend, husband, or a child in the eye and say, \u2018I cheated.\u201d\n\nThen, in what appears to be a not-so-veiled threat, he implies he will out them all. \u201cThey have done enormous damage in the process,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I will no longer provide them the shelter of my silence.\u201d", "description": "The ex-NBC host penned a stunning victim-blaming letter against Brooke Nevils, who alleges Lauer anally raped her in a hotel room at the Sochi Olympics in 2014.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1743,w_3100,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570632482/RTR4KYQC_hvqrc4", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
