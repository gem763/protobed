It wasn\u2019t a bad performance from Beckham, acquired during the offseason by the Browns in a trade with the New York Giants. But it was still a ho-hum afternoon for the star wide receiver.\n\nAnd given the ostentatious touch he showed in wearing a Richard Mille wristwatch, the underwhelming output on the field is leading to major criticism around the league.\n\nCleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is introduced as he runs out on the field before an NFL football game against the Tennessee Titans, in Cleveland, Sept. 8, 2019. (Ron Schwane/AP)\n\nSurprisingly, some of that criticism is coming from Warren Sapp. The former NFL defensive lineman, who was once fined $75,000 in a game for repeated unsportsmanlike conduct, thinks that Beckham needs to start playing like the star wide receiver he once was and focus on touchdowns, not bling.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, Sapp took issue with Beckham\u2019s conduct, not his wardrobe.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t wear a $350,000 watch and play like a $2 bill. That don\u2019t get it done. It was a nice-looking watch - matched the uniform and everything,\u201d Sapp said. \u201cBut I\u2019d love to see you in the end zone, dancing or something. C\u2019mon, man.\u201d\n\nNot only did the Browns move a lot of pieces to acquire Beckham this offseason to bolster their offense, but there is also a considerable investment being made in terms of his contract. Beckham is earning $17 million this year, a number that makes him the second highest-paid wide receiver in the league this year.\n\nSammy Watkins, the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL this year, did what he was supposed to do and led all wide receivers in receiving in Week 1 with 198 yards and three touchdowns. All told, 26 players in Week 1 registered 100 or more receiving yards, underscoring Beckham\u2019s disappointing lack of production.\n\n\u201cYou want to talk about your watch? The score is my concern,\u201d Sapp said. \u201cWhenever I hear one of these prima donnas put their issue in a team statement, then I\u2019d be a little more accepting about it.\u201d", "description": "Warren Sapp calls out NFL wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. for playing like \"a $2 bill\" while wearing a flashy watch on the field.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/odell-beckham-AP.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
