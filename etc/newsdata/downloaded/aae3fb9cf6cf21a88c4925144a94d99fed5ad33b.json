It's been tough times, gaining my card and not playing well,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been a struggle, I had a good amateur career... There's always a lot of expectation when you turn pro at a young age. It never really got going.\n\n\"The last two years, it's been a tough, but I've taught myself to be patient and decided that I want to play on the Sunshine Tour and get a win. That was my 2019 goal to get a Sunshine Tour win so I managed to accomplish that.\"\n\nWhen asked what his next 2019 goal is, Lawrence replied: \"Two Sunshine Tour wins.\"\n\nThis week, the Sunshine Tour will be in the Wild Coast for the Sun Challenge starting from Wednesday to Friday.\n\nGolfers who've won their maiden Sunshine Tour title in 2019:\n\n1. Benjamin Follett-Smith (Zimbabwe)\n\n2. Philip Eriksson (Sweden)\n\n3. Jean-Paul Strydom (South Africa)\n\n4. Martin Rohwer (South Africa)\n\n5. Jake Redman (South Africa)\n\n6.
