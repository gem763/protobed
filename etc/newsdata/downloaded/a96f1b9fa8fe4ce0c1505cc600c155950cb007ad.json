Photo-Illustration: Intelligencer; Photos: Scott Heins; Noam Galai/Getty Images\n\nOn September 23, the United Nations will open its Climate Action Summit here in New York, three days after the Global Climate Strike, led by Greta Thunberg, will sweep through thousands of cities across the globe. To mark the occasion, Intelligencer will be publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful themselves.)\n\nToday, MSNBC will host the first half of its two-day Democratic-primary forum on climate change \u2014 a full day of climate programming, followed by a second full day tomorrow. The event is presented by New York magazine, along with Georgetown\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service and Our Daily Planet. Earlier this week, I spoke separately with hosts Chris Hayes and Ali Velshi about the state of climate coverage on television and how each sees the state of the race and the state of the planet. The following Q&A combines the two conversations.\n\nDavid Wallace-Wells: I look at the last year of climate politics and things seem so different now than they did a year, 18 months ago. Does it seem that way to you?\n\nAli Velshi: Yeah, I think it\u2019s moved from the kind of thing that people believe is true into the kind of thing people believe is a crisis. There\u2019s definitely been a change in energy. Suddenly, people are talking about this as an imperative. And where the biggest move has come, in full, is from personal behavior into trying to influence institutional and governmental behavior, which I think is where the answer lies. There seems to have been a lot of emphasis on what individuals can do about it. And I think we\u2019ve now understood that if all of us drink from paper straws and drive electric cars, we\u2019re still not going to come close to dealing with our targets. I don\u2019t know what has caused that shift to occur, but it seems to have occurred.\n\nDWW: Has there been any similar change in the way climate is covered on TV?\n\nAV: It was community service a little while ago. Up to a year ago, I was doing hurricane coverage, and when we started doing it in earnest at MSNBC, either Chris or I would insert the discussion about climate change into the coverage. We would sometimes get pushback from people to say, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to talk about that,\u201d in the same fashion that people, when you cover a shooting, would say, \u201cNow\u2019s not the time to talk about it.\u201d\n\nDWW: Chris, at least in my corner of Twitter, that tweet you sent a year or so ago about climate change being sort of a ratings killer was \u2014 that\u2019s been like a talking point ever since.\n\nChris Hayes: [Laughs] Good God, yes, let\u2019s talk more about that tweet!\n\nDWW: Do you still see things that way? Do you think in general TV news views climate change that way?\n\nCH: The first thing I\u2019d say is I think that people inside media tend to underestimate how much power they have over people\u2019s attention. You\u2019re trying very hard all the time, under incredible pressures of metrics and ratings, to get people\u2019s attention, and sometimes you fail. So it feels like you have very little control over what people pay attention to. And in a corollary fashion, people outside media tend to overestimate how much people inside media can focus attention. They think, like, Oh, if you just cover this, everyone will watch. That\u2019s just not true. There are topics and things that you will do and people just turn away.\n\nBut people are paying more attention, and I think that TV media is pretty good at like sniffing that out when it happens. And so there\u2019s kind of a good, virtuous cycle right now. There are things happening on the climate front \u2014 much of the credit due to activist groups and organizers and people on the ground and everyday citizens \u2014 and that\u2019s generated news, it\u2019s generated conflict, it\u2019s generated like big announcements, things that are coverable. It\u2019s also generated attention, and people\u2019s attention to the climate crisis is really increasing. And the coverage has followed that.\n\nDWW: Do you see that in network news or just cable news?\n\nCH: I don\u2019t actually know the answer at the level of network news just because I don\u2019t monitor it very closely. But I think probably the level of network news, too.\n\nDWW: Cable news is obviously way ahead, though.\n\nAV: Well, I think it\u2019s got to do with format, right? We\u2019ve got 24 hours a day to do this stuff, so we can be experimental. I can book a segment a day on climate change. Sometimes they\u2019re really good, and sometimes they\u2019re a little technical and don\u2019t resonate as much. But I do at least two and sometimes three shows a day. So it doesn\u2019t matter if I get it right all the time. That work is a struggle to get into half an hour of news in a world where one story sucks up most of the oxygen and then other stories have to get in there.\n\nDWW: It\u2019s always struck me as strange because television news loves natural disasters. Producers obviously don\u2019t see them as ratings killers. And to me the climate context only heightens the narrative drama of a disaster \u2014 to talk about how this isn\u2019t just terrifying in its own right, it\u2019s terrifying as a portent of what\u2019s to come. But the networks are reluctant to connect those dots.\n\nAV: And you know, for instance, that warming oceans and weaker prevailing winds are gonna cause what happened in the Bahamas to happen a lot more. I think that we as journalists are getting smarter about things like that, in part because of books like yours, which are written for people who are not scientists. But it\u2019s still a lot like what I do in economic reporting, where I\u2019m dealing with economics for an audience that are not economists. We are now all trying to deal with science for an audience that\u2019s not made up of scientists. It\u2019s taken time to get that right.\n\nCH: One thing that\u2019s been unlocked a little bit is the weather-climate nexus. For a variety of complicated reasons, there was reticence, not all of which is indefensible, about conflating weather and climate. You know, weather is variable, day to day; climate is these sort of longer-term trends. And you can\u2019t just be like, \u201cEvery single weather event is climate change.\u201d But at a certain point because we have the climate we have, which is warmer, it\u2019s almost definitionally true that all the weather that\u2019s happening is related to that.\n\nDWW: Is there any reason to worry about that phenomenon, though? I\u2019m a part of it, probably, and to some degree you\u2019re a part of it, too, but do you think there\u2019s any danger that we\u2019ve overstated the case about those connections and brought the audience into a hot-boiled, emotional landscape about the state of climate change before the science really merits it?\n\nCH: Here\u2019s the thing that I worry about, which is related to but distinct from that. People have taken the IPCC timeline and the social and intellectual impact of your book, as well, and they\u2019ve created this kind of idea in their heads about a binary situation between doomed and not doomed. Like, the plane either takes off or crashes. But as you lay out in the actual book and as you and I have discussed, that\u2019s not the way it works. It\u2019s like every little bit at every margin counts.\n\nThe shorthand of \u201cWe have 12 years or we\u2019re doomed\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s based on what the IPCC is saying, sort of, but it\u2019s hard to put in your mind just the scale of it and also the fact that it all matters marginally.\n\nDWW: So how would you rate the conversation on the presidential-campaign trail so far? Do you think it\u2019s been rigorous and serious?\n\nCH: I think it\u2019s done pretty well, actually. I mean, it\u2019s been light-years better than previous campaigns or the other party\u2019s internal deliberations. Is that good enough? I don\u2019t know. I mean, I thought the \u201cClimate Forum\u201d on CNN was quite good and pretty sophisticated. But I think that the most important thing is a discussion about prioritization.\n\nI tend to think that primaries have two tracks. One is the candidate selection and then the other is the creation of an issue set and priorities. Sometimes those come together, and sometimes they\u2019re a little distinct from each other. But one of the most consequential things happening in the Democratic primary right now is about this prioritization-sequencing question: Does the next Democratic president understand this as the priority? Whoever it is. And I think the odds of that now are much higher than they were six months ago. Much higher.\n\nDWW: Then there\u2019s the matter of, like, how many priorities can you actually address in the time you\u2019ve got with the political capital that you have?\n\nCH: Well, that\u2019s why priorities are zero-sum, right? Which is why there\u2019s a real important debate to be had about what actually comes first.\n\nDWW: Do you think we\u2019ll see that debate more explicitly?\n\nCH: Yes. Everyone tries to paper it over now, because why would you want to piss everyone off?\n\nAV: One of the difficulties we\u2019re facing right now is that certainly all the Democratic candidates are on what you would call the right side of the issue. But what we haven\u2019t got from everybody is what happens beyond platitudes. So what I\u2019m hoping to achieve out of this forum is some sense of that: What do you see this as? How do you articulate this problem? How serious do you think climate change is? What do you think has to happen to mitigate it? And then how will you convince people for whom this is not yet an imperative [when it] might cost them money? Do you want to get behind this? I\u2019m not talking about executive action the first hundred days or congressional action. I\u2019m talking about the fact that to remedy this will actually require the government to lean into it, and the government doesn\u2019t lean into things that cost them money unless they believe there\u2019s public support behind those things. And fixing this problem will cost money.\n\nI\u2019ve never asked a candidate \u201cWho\u2019s going to pay for this?,\u201d because I think that\u2019s a stupid question \u2014 we\u2019re paying for it anyway. However, paying for the damages is accidental; paying for mitigation is deliberate. And the Democratic candidates are going to have to convince people to get onside for a deliberate allocation of resources to fight climate change.\n\nDWW: Inslee made this point to me when we spoke that it was really notable that Trump came out and tried to claim he was an environmentalist, as laughable as that seemed, because it showed at least on some level that he and his staff recognize he\u2019s already suffering for having taken some of the positions he\u2019s taken. But if that is the case, is there any one of the Democrats who are making a kind of clearheaded case for action to take advantage of that?\n\nAV: Bernie Sanders and others have done a good job of putting a cost on it. The Green New Deal struggles with that a little bit. I\u2019m not troubled by that because we know that the cost of inaction is greater than the cost of any action we can take. The problem is, how do you articulate that in terms of [helping] people who don\u2019t have $400 extra a month, as we saw with the shutdown? What\u2019s the way in which you say this? Is it centered around health care? Or climate migrants or floods or hurricanes or rising sea level or wildfires or your children\u2019s health or an uninhabitable planet? What are the ways in which you as a candidate articulate how serious this is and why it requires massive government and industrial efforts to combat it?\n\nDWW: The question is really important, I think, in the sense that something like 75 percent of Americans are concerned about climate change. But just a sliver are willing to pay $10 a month to deal with it.\n\nAV: Correct. And so that\u2019s where the heavy lift is. A corollary is health care. When you talk about Medicare for All and people say, \u201cWell, this is going to be the cost over ten years,\u201d then I put up a chart that says, \u201cBut this is the cost of our existing law over ten years and x tens of millions of people are covered. Wouldn\u2019t you rather do this than that? The return on investment on this one is better than that one.\u201d That\u2019s the argument that we have to have with climate. That the ROI; it\u2019s better if you do x than current law.\n\nDWW: In general in our politics, we have a hard time talking about comparative costs. We treat the status quo as though it\u2019s free. And think any new programs are too expensive.\n\nAV: One hundred percent. We think doing nothing\u2019s free.\n\nDWW: And what about on the other side of the aisle? Is there any reason for optimism there?\n\nCH: No. I mean, you can squint and find, like, Oh, there\u2019s the climate caucus now, and, you know, Frank Luntz is coming around and the polling is bad for them. It has become a political liability, in a way.\n\nDWW: Personally, I didn\u2019t expect that to happen so soon.\n\nCH: But the collective behavior of that party is essentially sociopathic at a global scale. It\u2019s like if everyone\u2019s driving on a street at 30 miles an hour and someone comes barreling down at 80 miles an hour drunk. It\u2019s indefensibly dangerous and reckless and has already led to unfathomable amounts of misery and death. It\u2019s almost impossible to put your arms around it. Like, what the Republican Party and the Trump administration are doing is \u2014 on a longer timescale and in a less acute, visible way \u2014 not different or morally distinct from the Soviet leadership during Chernobyl.\n\nDWW: I just saw this Washington Post poll today showing that eight-in-ten Americans say human activity is fueling climate change. Other polls say 73, 74 percent. Either way, it\u2019s a strong majority. If that\u2019s the case, how can the Republican Party continue as it is with anything like its present-tense climate politics?\n\nCH: I think you\u2019ll see a very fast pivot, and you\u2019ve already seen it. Of course, yes, humans are causing climate change, but we\u2019re not even 20 percent of global emissions, and no one\u2019s really gonna stop China and India, and so [they will say] we\u2019ve just got to build the wall as high as we can.\n\nDWW: So given all those obstacles, is it conceivable we could decarbonize at the rate that the U.N. says we need to avoid catastrophic warming?\n\nAV: I think we\u2019ve got to think of it as a moon shot.", "description": "MSNBC is hosting a two-day Democratic-primary forum on climate change.
