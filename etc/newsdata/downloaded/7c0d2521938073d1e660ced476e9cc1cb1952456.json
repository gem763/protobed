(AP) - A retired firefighter whose 34-year-old brother was one of 343 New York City firefighters who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center of Sept. 11, 2001, has been tooling around the country on his Harley Davidson since his retirement in 2005.\n\n\u201cI responded to the twin towers,\u201d said Rob Carlo, 56. \u201cI lost my younger brother, Michael, there.\u201d\n\nWhen he\u2019s not visiting iconic places that make the United States so incredible, he roosts in Long Beach, N.Y., where he pedals his beach cruiser on the town\u2019s two-mile-long boardwalk.\n\nOn Sept. 12, 2001, Carlo said, he was introduced to the Fire Department of New York\u2019s Counseling Service Unit.\n\n\u201cAs a lot of people were,\u201d he said, during a visit to the Brattleboro Retreat on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve been going to various forms of counseling with the unit since then and I am still in active counseling.\u201d\n\nBut Carlo, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, realized he needed more.\n\n\u201cI reached out to the counseling unit and asked about retreats,\u201d he said. It was through the NYFD\u2019s counseling unit that he learned about the Uniformed Services Program at the Brattleboro Retreat. \u201cI wanted some structure and some tools to help me beyond that one-hour session a week.\u201d\n\nIn the winter of 2017, Carlo attended a two-week session of the USP and was so impressed by the services that he has returned each year since for the USP\u2019s annual Ride For Heroes fundraiser, a motorcycle cruise around southern Vermont every August. At this year\u2019s event, riders raised more than $18,000 for the program that provides, according to its website, \u201cspecialized training and support for men and women in uniform (active or retired) who are struggling with serious duty-related problems including PTSD, depression, and addiction.\u201d\n\nBut Carlo wanted to do more to help raise money for the USP.\n\n\u201cNine days later (after the 2019 ride) I thought about doing my own ride,\u201d he said.\n\nBut not on his Harley this time, opting instead for his single-speed beach cruiser.\n\nComing up on his 56th birthday, Carlo remembered something he learned during his time at the Retreat - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which gives participants tools \u201cto live a life that\u2019s aligned with your values and not controlled by painful thoughts, feelings, and memories of difficult experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things they stress in the program is a commitment to an action that leads toward a positive value in your life,\u201d said Carlo. \u201cWith my birthday coming up, I decided to take a positive action instead of being a year older and closer to the end, dwelling on the doom and gloom.\u201d\n\nTrying to think up an idea to do something positive for his birthday, he busted out his beach cruiser and started pedaling along the boardwalk, deep in thought. That\u2019s when he had his light bulb moment for riding 24 hours straight.\n\n\u201cI mentioned it to a buddy and he said why not make it a fundraiser,\u201d said Carlo, who couldn\u2019t think of anything better to raise money for than the Retreat\u2019s USP.\n\nWith a little help from the folks at the Retreat, he set up a Facebook fundraiser, bringing in nearly $2,000 in the first 24 hours. On Aug. 27, he began riding his bike at 6 p.m., pedaling through the night. Thirty-nine laps and more than 120 miles later, he raised nearly $20,000 for the USP.\n\nCarlo decided to start the ride at 6 p.m. because he thought he would need all his energy for the \u201cloneliest and hardest\u201d part of the ride, after midnight and into the dawn.\n\n\u201cI thought it was going to be a very long night of solitude on the boardwalk,\u201d he said, but he was wrong. \u201cI had more people riding with me at 3 a.m. on a Monday night than I did at 9 a.m. In fact, I was never alone for the 24 hours.\u201d\n\nPeople showed up to ride with him and cheer him on, bringing him coffee and food.\n\n\u201cI think I gained weight,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carlo met with members of the Brattleboro Area Development Professionals Meeting at the Retreat to talk about his success at raising money for the Retreat.\n\nHe told them he didn\u2019t really know what he was getting into when he decided to raise money for the USP, but he learned quite a bit as a result.\n\n\u201cDonations poured in from around the country,\u201d said Carlo, largely because he was tied into a community of motorcycle riders that shares experiences and is well-known for its largess when it comes to donating for good causes.\n\n\u201cI was doing it in a town that embraces good causes and being in the motorcycle community I had the long reach of 1,500 friends across the country,\u201d said Carlo. \u201cAnd just having a cause that helps veterans with PTSD was another element of this that all came together to make a perfect storm in a good way.\u201d\n\nCarlo also posted updates and live videos on Facebook during his 24 hours on the boardwalk, posts that were shared exponentially. He also posted as many thank yous as possible to all the individual donors.\n\n\u201cI was watching the numbers on the day of the event,\u201d said Konstantin von Kruisenstiern, the Retreat\u2019s vice president of strategy and development. \u201cI thought there was some kind of mistake.\u201d\n\nCarlo\u2019s biggest tips to the development professionals gathered at the Retreat were to make any fundraising effort personal, maybe involving some sort of physical challenge, and by appealing to folks directly or indirectly affected by each of the organizations.\n\n\u201cThe more you engage people along the way, the bigger it grows,\u201d he said.\n\nCarlo said he hopes to do it again next year, and maybe with a little bit more planning than he did for this effort. He also hopes his fundraising effort can help raise awareness among veterans and emergency responders about the Retreat\u2019s Uniformed Services Program.\n\n\u201cYou are going to experience a lot of trauma over your career,\u201d he said. \u201cYou clearly can\u2019t control those thoughts, but it\u2019s what you do with those thoughts that count. What you learn at USP really helps you process those thoughts and appreciate them for what they are.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2VIIzqo\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Brattleboro Reformer, http://www.reformer.com/\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A retired firefighter whose 34-year-old brother was one of 343 New York City firefighters who died in the collapse of the World Trade Center of Sept. 11, 2001, has been tooling around the country on his Harley Davidson since his retirement in 2005.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bob Audette"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
