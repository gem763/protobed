Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) described the Massachusetts senator as \u201cmore interested in being punitive\u201d than in uniting a divided country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI think we need to be focused on lifting people up,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cSometimes I think that Sen. Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting one part of the country against the other.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Sen. Amy Klobuchar Amy Jean KlobucharHillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill Analysis: Warren and Booker most cyber-aware 2020 candidates Poll: Democratic support for Warren climbs to record high MORE (D-Minn.) accused Warren of casting herself as the only candidate on stage willing to stand up to the ultrawealthy. Rather, she argued, the candidates simply have different approaches to tackling the issues facing Americans.\n\n\u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth. No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires,\u201d Klobuchar said, referring to billionaire philanthropist and presidential candidate Tom Steyer Thomas (Tom) Fahr Steyer2020 primary debate guide: Everything you need to know ahead of the October showdown The Hill's Campaign Report: Impeachment fight to take center stage at Dem debate CNN LGBTQ town hall interrupted by protesters MORE. \u201cWe have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d\n\nOne of the most heated exchanges of the evening came during a discussion over health care and Medicare for All, the single-payer health care system proposed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernie SandersSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Hillicon Valley: Warren takes on Facebook over political ads | Zuckerberg defends meetings with conservatives | Civil liberties groups sound alarm over online extremism bill On The Money: Trump touts China trade deal | Wall Street, Washington see signs for caution | Trump threatens sanctions on Turkey | Sanders proposes sharp hike to corporate taxes MORE (I-Vt.).\n\nWhen Warren punted on a question about whether such a health care model would require raising taxes for middle-class Americans, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg Peter (Pete) Paul ButtigiegO'Rourke hits back at Buttigieg over criticism of his gun buyback proposal Chasten Buttigieg fundraising for husband Pete overseas Progressives fume at Buttigieg, warn him not to attack Warren at debate MORE went on the attack.\n\n\u201cA yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said of Warren\u2019s response. \u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything \u2014 except this.\u201d\n\nThe barrage of attacks is reflective of Warren\u2019s top-tier status in the Democratic primary contest. She\u2019s steadily climbed to the top of polls in recent weeks, in some cases even surpassing former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenSupport drops for Medicare for All but increases for public option Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE, the longtime front-runner.\n\nShe also raked in one of the heftiest sums of campaign cash in the third fundraising quarter of the year \u2014 roughly $25.6 million. Only one other candidate, Sanders, pulled in more money in the past three months.\n\nThe attacks also showcased an emerging reality in the primary contest: Warren, not Sanders, is now seen by her opponents as the most formidable progressive in the race.\n\nAt the same time, some of Warren\u2019s lower-polling opponents at Tuesday night\u2019s debate \u2014 namely Buttigieg, Klobuchar and O\u2019Rourke \u2014 are in desperate need of a boost.\n\nKlobuchar and O\u2019Rourke have lingered in the low single-digits in public polls for months, while Buttigieg, who saw success early on in the primary contest, has declined over the past several months.\n\nFor her part, Warren was aggressive in defending herself from her critics, arguing that Democrats should aspire to bring about sweeping political and economic change rather than resign themselves to more incremental policy adjustments.\n\nHer performance also showed that, even with her newfound frontrunner status, she is capable of fending off aggressive criticism.\n\n\u201cI think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren said.\n\n--Updated at 10:26 p.m.", "description": "Sen.
