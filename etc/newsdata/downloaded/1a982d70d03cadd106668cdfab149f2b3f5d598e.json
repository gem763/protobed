USA TODAY\n\nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2013 Perhaps Anthony Davis should not have talked with Kawhi Leonard about joining the Los Angeles Lakers. Then, maybe Leonard would\u2019ve chosen the Lakers instead of the LA Clippers.\n\n\u201cSomebody said he don\u2019t really like all the recruitment and all that stuff, so I felt like I overstepped my boundaries,\u201d Davis said, with a chuckle. \u201cBut it was a fun process. I would do it all over.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers still enter the 2019-20 NBA season with championship aspirations partly because they acquired Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans shortly before the draft.\n\nWhen they face the Clippers at Staples Center on Tuesday (10:30 p.m. ET, TNT), the Lakers may also wonder what could have been.\n\nPerhaps the Lakers could have had a \"Big Three\" with LeBron James, Davis and Leonard, while the Clippers would have had a team filled with role players. After all, the Clippers signed Leonard partly because they also acquired Paul George from Oklahoma City for Shai Gilgeous- Alexander, Danilo Gallinari and a handful of draft picks.\n\nInstead, the Lakers and Clippers face off in what could become the beginning of an intra-city rivalry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised by anything really. But I also don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d James said. \u201cI don\u2019t get too excited until things actually happen. But I thought we had a chance. That\u2019s all you can ask for. ...\n\n\"When he went to the Clippers, I thought that was just as cool. It was great for our league, and he had to do what was best for him. And we all respect that.\u201d\n\nJames and Davis still plan to talk with Leonard before the game. James said he will not revisit with Leonard his free-agency destination, joking, \u201cKawhi doesn\u2019t talk to you guys.\u201d James has become much more illuminating with reporters. When it came to detailing his recruiting efforts with Leonard, however, James said that \u201cwe don\u2019t really talk about what happens on my phone.\u201d\n\nAnthony Davis and LeBron James tried to woo Kawhi Leonard to the Lakers.

Leonard also met separately with Magic Johnson, even though he stepped down as the Lakers\u2019 president of basketball operations before the regular season ended.\n\nLeonard may have become irked that details emerged about the Lakers\u2019 recruiting efforts, while the Clippers operated stealthily. Yet, Leonard has said he became more intrigued with teaming up with George in hopes of delivering the Clippers their first NBA championship. Though George will miss possibly the first 10 games of the season after having surgery on his left shoulder, an NBA.com survey revealed the majority of the league\u2019s general managers pin the Clippers as favorites to win the league title. Three of five USA TODAY Sports panelists tapped the Clippers.\n\n\u201cHe can do whatever he wants, obviously,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe thought that we had a chance but he made a decision and we\u2019re going to face him tonight. He\u2019s a hell of a player, they\u2019ve got a great team over there so it should be fun.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.", "description": "LeBron James and Anthony Davis tried to woo Kawhi Leonard to Los Angeles to play for the Lakers.
