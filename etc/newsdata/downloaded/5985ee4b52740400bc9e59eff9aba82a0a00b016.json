Virginia; should state money be involved?\n\nThe Washington Redskins practice in Virginia; their corporate home is in Virginia, and most of the players and coaches live in Virginia. But they play their home games in Maryland.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe wants to change that. He\u2019s spent hours, and a few state dollars, trying to convince Redskins owner Daniel Snyder to build a stadium in Northern Virginia.\n\nA stadium deal probably won\u2019t happen before McAuliffe leaves office next year, thanks to Virginia\u2019s one-term limit on governors. But some of the men looking to succeed McAuliffe are ready to take up the fight.\n\nState Sen. Frank Wagner, R-Va. Beach, is welcoming \u2013 to a point.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to have the Redskins move to Virginia,\u201d he said.\n\nBut how much state money should be involved? \u201cZero. I think it\u2019s totally inappropriate. We just cut $1.2 billion out of the budget. We made some hard choices, some very hard choices. And quite frankly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a priority to help subsidize a billionaire to move to Virginia.\u201d", "description": "WTOP.com; Governor wants Redskins to build stadium in N.
