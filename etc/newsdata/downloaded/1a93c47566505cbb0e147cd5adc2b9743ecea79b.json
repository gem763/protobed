Bakwela was allegedly stabbed to death by fellow pupil Mohammed Mwela, 19, last Monday. (Sesona Ngqakamba, News24)\n\nThe stabbing to death of a 16-year-old Grade 8 pupil at a Johannesburg school has again highlighted the prevalence of violence in South African schools.\n\nA study by the Centre for Justice and Crime Prevention (CJCP) has shown that violence is widespread in South African schools.\n\n\"One in five secondary school learners \u2013 a total of 22.2% \u2013 has experienced violence while at school in the 12 months between August 2011 and August 2012. This translates to just over a million learners (1 020 597) across the country,\" according to the study.\n\n\"Most of the violence is in the form of bullying as well as psychological violence. The problem is that it can escalate and that is where the danger lies. If that behaviour is not recognised by teachers or addressed by the school, with no interventions provided to children, then those situations can escalate into violence that is much more harmful,\" Patrick Burton, the CJCP's executive director, told News24.\n\nIn 2016, the Birth to Twenty Plus (Bt20+) study, led by the DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Human Development at Wits University, found, among other findings, that 99% of all children have witnessed or have been victims of violence in their home, school and/or community, with 36% reporting that they had been victims of all categories of violence studied.\n\nREAD: Violence in SA's schools is worse than you think, and spanking is part of the problem\n\nThis violence has manifested itself in seven reported school stabbings in the past six months.\n\n1. Forest High School, Johannesburg\n\nOn Monday, June 3, an altercation broke out between four boys at Forest High School in Turffontein, Johannesburg. In what has been reported as a gang-related incident, Grade 8 pupil Daniel Bakwela, 16, was stabbed to death, allegedly while attacking fellow pupil Mohammed Mwela with two other pupils who were hospitalised following the incident.\n\nMwela, who claims to have been defending himself, has since been released on R5 000 bail and will continue his exams at a different school.\n\nAccording to a report by The Star, the school is \"a prison\" where gangs thrive, and younger boys are allegedly forced to perform sexual acts on older pupils.\n\n\"This school should be called 'Forest High Correctional Service'. When you go to the toilet, the older guys tell you that this is not a place for small boys and you are forced to pay money,\" one pupil told the newspaper.\n\n\"They also tell you to massage their penises and make them ejaculate. Almost 99% of the school is either on weed or some kind of a drug,\" another pupil reportedly said.\n\nAccording to another pupil, two rival gangs \u2013 the South Top Kids and Italian Destruction Vele \u2013 have members inside and outside the school.\n\nThe case against Mwela was postponed to July 10.\n\n2.

We need to heal as a nation.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, at a memorial service at Forest High School in Johannesburg, Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said: \"There is no child that is born ill-disciplined. Why are we such an ill-disciplined nation? A nation that believes it can resolve problems through violence. An eye for an eye makes all of us blind.\"\n\nLesufi said it was better to have a battle of ideas than a battle of weapons.\n\nKEEP UPDATED on the latest news by subscribing to our FREE newsletter.\n\n- FOLLOW News24 on Twitter", "description": "A study has shown that violence is widespread in South African schools.
