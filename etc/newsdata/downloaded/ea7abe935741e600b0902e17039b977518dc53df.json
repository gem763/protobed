After freeing the four Plague Lords of the desert, the sinister Tekahn has used their power to become the fifth and final Plague Lord. Now he is Tekahn, Plague Lord of Flame and only the League of Explorers can stop him.\n\nThis is not like the previous four chapters. There is only one battle here in Chapter V and it\u2019s against Tekahn himself. His power is tremendous, but you\u2019ll now have all four League of Explorers on your side. You\u2019ll also have any of the treasures you\u2019ve unlocked, so go back and grab any you missed. We\u2019ll also go over a neat little trick to help you knock out Tekahn quickly at the end.\n\nHere\u2019s how to beat Tekahn, Plague Lord of Flame.\n\nVideo of Tombs of Terror Cinematic Trailer Hearthstone\n\nPhase 1: Awaken the Flame\n\nHero power: Imbue a Sanctum Golem with the power of fire. (Costs 2 mana)\n\nFirst things\u2019s first. Let\u2019s go over what a Sanctum Golem is before anything else. For four mana, Tekahn will summon a 6/6 Sanctum Golem that can\u2019t move or attack. Once he uses his Hero Power to bring it to life, the Sanctum Golem becomes an Enflamed Golem, which gets a Deathrattle that deals three damage to all minions, at which point it will summon another Sanctum Golem.\n\nYour best strategy will be to use Tekahn\u2019s own power against him and use the Enflamed Golem\u2019s Deathrattle to clear out Tekahn\u2019s minions whenever possible. This won\u2019t be easy, though. Tekahn will play Rakanishu on Turn 2, which will turn all of Tekahn\u2019s Lackeys into 4/4s for the remainder of the game. And Tekahn has many Lackey-generating resources, so this will become difficult to deal with over time. Use board control spells whenever possible, especially early on when using Reno. If you\u2019re willing to eat a few hits, wait until multiple Enflamed Golems are active and set them off at the same time, creating a massive chain reaction that clears the board.\n\nIf you\u2019re using Sir Finley, be careful about using his trusty Truesilver Lance on Heroic difficulty. On Heroic, Tekahn will pack more than one Gluttonous Ooze and make you pay.\n\nPlayStation 5 release confirmed for 2020 holiday season; Sony touts new controllers with improved haptic feedback\n\nPhase 2: Curse of Flame\n\nHero power: Choose an enemy minion. If it lives until your next turn, deal 5 damage to all characters. (Costs 2 mana)\n\nYou\u2019ll want to be careful about using higher-health minions with Tekahn\u2019s second Hero Power. He\u2019ll be mindful about making your hardest-to-remove minion its target. If something gets caught by Curse of Flame and threatens to clear your side of the board, use spells like Mutate or something like the Witchy Lackey to undo it.\n\nYour safest bet here is to try and get through this second phase as quickly as possible. Take advantage of your treasures, along with harder-hitting legendaries like The Lich King and get through this phase as fast as you can. Tekahn will have a slew of new legendaries to throw at you, along with an assembly line of 4/4 Lackeys that can devastate you quickly if you let his board get out of control.\n\nAs tough as it might be to try and wrestle control of the control from Tekahn, you\u2019re going to want to get the biggest advantage you can heading into the final phase. Fill your board, do whatever you have to do, because if you\u2019re not ready for the final phase, you\u2019re going to lose fast.\n\nCollect treasures as the Saviours of Uldum in Hearthstone's latest solo adventure Tombs of Terror.

(Passive)\n\nIf you have high-cost cards in this final phase, they\u2019re likely to become a liability. You will take damage equal to that card\u2019s cost, which isn\u2019t good for you, because even in this final phase, Tekahn likely has more health than you do. On top of that, he\u2019ll still have a lot of Lackeys available to him, which will only dock him one Health each. And even if you do play something big, Tekahn might have some sneaky minion removal spells available to him.\n\nTo make this harder still, Tekahn will immediately play the 10-Mana spell \u201cThe Final Plague?!\u201d This summons all four of the Old Gods: the 6/6 C\u2019Thun, the 5/7 N\u2019Zoth, the Corruptor, Y\u2019Shaarj, Rage Unbound, and Yogg-Saron, Hope\u2019s End. And with Y\u2019Shaarj\u2019s effect, he\u2019ll bring out another of Tekahn\u2019s minions from his deck at the end of the turn. So you\u2019re now staring down five minions to start this final phase. This is where you\u2019ve hopefully saved a powerful area-of-effect spell like Blizzard, because it\u2019s going to save your life here, even if it does cost you six Health.\n\nThis is Tekahn\u2019s last gasp and he is absolutely not going to make it easy on you. If you\u2019ve saved Lifesteal minions like Zilliax, now\u2019s the time to play them, because you\u2019re going to need something to mitigate the Health cost from Tekahn\u2019s Hero Power.\n\nMario Kart Tour game review: Mobile version of Nintendo racer is ruined by greedy microtransactions\n\nEven if it looks like you\u2019re on the verge of victory, Tekahn can still unleash some nasty surprises, like Hakkar, the Soulflayer, Mal\u2019Ganis (which will make Tekahn immune to his own Hero Power), and Fel Lord Betrug.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to win here if you keep Tekahn\u2019s side of the board clear and have a decent board from the phase prior, but it\u2019s not going to be easy. If you\u2019re trying to play a straightforward fight, this could be where you lose, especially on Heroic. Yes, Tekahn is more than capable of wiping out all four League of Explorers in this final phase. Use your treasures strategically and you should be able to prevail, but even then, you\u2019ll need some luck on your side.\n\nAn easier way to defeat Tekahn\n\nBut what if there\u2019s an easier way to defeat Tekahn? It is entirely possible to knock out Tekahn from the first phase and give him the one-turn kill of a lifetime. But you\u2019re going to need a few ingredients that you\u2019ve picked up along the way. You\u2019ll need Reno Jackson and all of his treasures to make this work. It\u2019ll take a lot of preparation, but it\u2019s worth it.\n\nPlay the control game for the duration of Reno\u2019s deck, casting control spells and taking out Enflamed Golems to help you ward off Tekahn\u2019s minions. You\u2019ll want to play a lot of spells for the big whammy at the end. Now let\u2019s get to the fun part.\n\nCan you defeat the final boss Tekahn without going into Phase 2 and 3? Photo: Blizzard Entertainment\n\nOne of Reno\u2019s treasures is a 2-mana minion named Lei Flamepaw. Lei\u2019s effect is if you play a spell, he\u2019ll play it again on the same target. Use Shadow of Death on Lei to shuffle three Shadows into Reno\u2019s deck. Lei\u2019s effect will kick in and you\u2019ll shuffle another three Shadows for a total of six. If possible, play Shadow of Death twice, just for fun.\n\nYou\u2019ll hit a point where you pull out more than one Shadow, summoning multiple copies of Lei. By this point, you should have The Gatling Wand in hand and its damage total should be well over 60. If you have multiple copies of Lei on the board, all of them will cast extra copies of Reno\u2019s Gatling Wand, which will actually wipe out Tekahn in a single blow. Once the Leis are on the board, count the damage, let the Gatling Wand rip, and watch the fireworks.\n\nAstral Chain game review: Nintendo Switch exclusive pushes the boundaries of what an action RPG can be\n\nThis is not an easy combo to pull off, because a lot of things need to go right. You have to have the Gatling Wand ready, you have to have it sufficiently powered, and you have to draw Lei Flamepaw and have copies of Shadow of Death ready to cast on him. A lot can go wrong, but don\u2019t feel discouraged. If Reno dies, start the fight over and try again.\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy combo to pull off, but it is the easiest way to skip the second and third phases entirely and skipping that final phase is definitely worth the effort. Regardless of how you go about beating Tekahn, once you do, enjoy the final dialogue and the teases for where Hearthstone\u2019s ongoing Year of the Dragon storyline with the League of E.V.I.L. may be going.\n\nCongratulations on taking care of Tekahn, Plague Lord of Flame and saving Uldum! You have triumphed! Now we wait to see what\u2019s next for Hearthstone\u2019s single-player adventures.
