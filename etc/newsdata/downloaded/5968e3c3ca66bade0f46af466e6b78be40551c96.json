Photo: Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn dramatic testimony Tuesday morning, William Taylor, the American envoy to Ukraine, provided the most complete picture yet of how centrally the Trump administration\u2019s Ukraine policy revolved around a quid pro quo: military aid and a White House visit in exchange for an investigation into Joe Biden\u2019s son and another involving the origins of the FBI\u2019s investigation into President Trump.\n\nIn a long opening statement that prompted sighs and gasps among lawmakers, Taylor made it clear that those who were steering the White House\u2019s Ukraine policy, including U.S. ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland, were preoccupied with the investigations. Sondland, Taylor said, had cited them as a reason why the White House held up Ukraine military aid for months. Taylor also said that Sondland had heard about the Biden investigation from the president himself, contradicting Sondland\u2019s testimony last week. Taylor drew on extensive notes he had taken at the time of the events he described.\n\nDemocrats framed his statements as deeply damaging to the president, while Republicans attempted to shrug them off. \u201cWhat he said was incredibly damning to the president of the United States,\u201d Representative Ted Lieu, said, echoing others\u2019 assessment of the testimony.\n\n\u201cAll I have to say is that in my 10 short months in Congress \u2026 it\u2019s my most disturbing day in Congress so far,\u201d said Rep. Andy Levin, a freshman Democrat from Michigan. \u2014 Shimon Prokupecz (@ShimonPro) October 22, 2019\n\nMembers have described Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony this morning as disturbing and very credible, backed up by \u201cmeticulous\u201d contemporaneous notes he took during phone calls and meetings. Those formed the backbone of a lengthy opening statement. \u2014 Garrett Haake (@GarrettHaake) October 22, 2019\n\nTaylor was involved in a now-notorious text message exchange between him, Sondland, and diplomat Kurt Volker, involving the administration\u2019s unusual posture toward the country. \u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor texted at one point. Sondland assured him there was no quid pro quo, in a text he has said he wrote after speaking with the president.\n\nMultiple Democrats suggested that Sondland, who testified last week, needed to return to clear up statements that conflicted with Taylor\u2019s.\n\nRep. Connolly to reporters just now: \u201cSpeaking for myself, I think Gordon Sondland may very well have to come back.\u201d \u2014 Sam Brodey (@sambrodey) October 22, 2019\n\nTaylor replaced the previous ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, whose suspect firing in May is also at the heart of Democrats\u2019 impeachment proceedings.\n\nAs with other witnesses involved in the proto-impeachment inquiry, the Trump administration attempted to block Taylor from talking to lawmakers at all. But after Democrats issued a subpoena compelling him to appear, Taylor, like previous witnesses, complied.\n\nThe White House has vociferously denied the existence of a quid pro quo, though White House chief of staff admitted the existence of one in a bungled press conference last week.", "description": "William Taylor, the U.S.\u2019s acting ambassador to Ukraine, provided the most complete picture yet of how centrally the Trump administration\u2019s Ukraine policy revolved around a corrupt quid pro quo.", "authors": ["Benjamin Hart"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/22/22-bill-taylor.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
