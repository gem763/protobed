Auto manufacturing represents about 1% of the nation's GDP.\n\nBut while the U.S. economy remains fairly strong, Michigan has the highest risk of recession in the nation, according to Lending Tree.\n\nIt's the economy, stupid: Pocketbook issues \u2014 like growth in income, inflation, and unemployment \u2014 have a well-established effect on how Americans vote. Anderson's research found...\n\nIn good times, voters tend to reward the incumbent party; in hard times, they tend to toss out the incumbents.\n\nIn tight races, even small shifts in a state's economic performance can matter.\n\nMichigan's economy looked shaky in early 2012 but improved later in the year, helping Obama narrowly win Michigan and secure re-election.\n\nIn 2016, with the U.S. economy in good shape, the pocketbook model predicted the incumbent party would win the popular vote nationally, which Democrat Hillary Clinton did.\n\nBut Trump was able to tap into economic anxiety in manufacturing-heavy swing states including Michigan, squeezing out enough narrow wins in the Electoral College to carry him to the presidency.\n\nWhat to watch: Trump promised Michigan in 2016 that he'd bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S., a promise largely unfulfilled. Faced with industry disruption and a looming cyclical downturn, it\u2019s not clear he can do anything to stop any of it.\n\nOur thought bubble: Voters may put aside their economic worries if the election becomes a referendum on impeachment; 33% of UAW workers voted for Trump in 2016.", "description": "The longer the strike lasts, the worse Michigan's fragile economy becomes.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/9RrqhajOtlAwggVJWQ1_wy1gagU=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/01/1569954973728.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
