Our thoughts and sympathies are with Steve\u2019s family and friends at this incredibly sad time.\u2019\n\nKyle has kept a low profile since The Jeremy Kyle Show axe (Picture: Rex Features/ITV)\n\nITV boss Kevin Lygo, however, remains adamant Kyle still has a future on ITV, confirming \u2018ongoing commitment to The Kyle Files\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We will just have to have a look because [Jeremy] is a consummate broadcaster and it would be absolutely wrong to apportion blame of the show against the presenter of it,\u2019 he argued.\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t hold him in any bad way. We will look to find another show with him, but I think it is unlikely it will go in the same slot.\u2019\n\nNeed support?
