Sportsmail assesses the ups and downs...\n\nManchester United showed glimpses of their potential in Sunday's 1-1 draw against Liverpool\n\nSolskjaer nailed his tactics\n\nOverall, United were the better team against the European champions and Premier League leaders who surrendered their 100 per cent record despite Adam Lallana's late equaliser.\n\nSolskjaer edged the tactical battle over Jurgen Klopp, pinning Liverpool's marauding full-backs in their own half for much of the game by playing three centre-backs and pushing Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Ashley Young further forward.\n\nHe also caused Liverpool's defence problems by deploying Marcus Rashford and Dan James in wide positions up front. Their pace and work-rate was key for United and led to Rashford's goal.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer (pictured) won his tactical battle against Jurgen Klopp at Old Trafford\n\nYoungsters impressing\n\nThe green shoots of what Solskjaer is trying to cultivate at United \u2013 a younger, more vibrant team built around predominantly British players \u2013 was evident.\n\nBesides the performances of Rashford, James and Wan-Bissaka, Harry Maguire marshalled the defensive effort and Scott McTominay provided drive from the base of midfield.\n\nAndreas Pereira also excelled in the No 10 role and there was even a more encouraging display from his fellow Brazil international Fred.\n\nAaron Wan-Bissaka was one of several United youngsters who impressed in Sunday's derby\n\nFitness crisis easing\n\nThe injury crisis that has hung over Old Trafford in recent weeks is beginning to clear.\n\nAnthony Martial made his comeback off the bench after eight weeks out with a thigh injury and will take some of the burden off Rashford.\n\nWan-Bissaka is fit again after a bout of tonsillitis that kept him out of the previous three games and international duty with England, while David de Gea played in goal despite concerns the groin strain he suffered playing for Spain might keep him out for a few weeks.\n\nThe return of Anthony Martial as a second half substitute is a big boost after injury crisis\n\nSolskjaer has the backing of the board\n\nEd Woodward's backing for Solskjaer before the game has given the Norwegian valuable breathing space as he continues to reshape this squad.\n\nResults will always dictate the mood at a football club and no manager is bullet-proof, but at least Solskjaer knows there is understanding at the top of the club that the project will take time.\n\nEd Woodward's backing of Solskjaer has given the Manchester United boss breathing space\n\nStill work to be done\n\nFor all the positives United can take from the game, a draw means it's their worst start since 1986 when Ron Atkinson was sacked and replaced by Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nThey are 13th in the table after a quarter of the season below Burnley, Bournemouth and Crystal Palace, and their next league game is at Norwich where Manchester City came unstuck last month.\n\nIt was the fourth time in the Premier League this season that Solskjaer's side have failed to protect a one-goal lead.\n\nWolves, Southampton, Arsenal and now Liverpool have all fought back to draw 1-1 with United, who couldn't even close out a victory against Rochdale in the Carabao Cup without penalties.\n\nThey did manage to snatch a late equaliser of their own against Crystal Palace but almost immediately conceded a winner at the other end.\n\nDespite an improved display, United still have much work to do after an awful start to season\n\nUnited not yet at full strength\n\nUnited are still without Paul Pogba whose right foot remains in a protective cast as he looks set to be sidelined until next month.\n\nThe Frenchman can be erratic but he is too great a talent not to be missed. His only contribution during a three-game absence has been to reignite speculation over a move to Real Madrid by being pictured in conversation with Zinedine Zidane.\n\nAlthough United's injury situation is improving, Luke Shaw has suffered a setback in his recovery from a hamstring problem and is undergoing a warm-weather rehabilitation programme in Dubai where he will be joined by Nemanja Matic.\n\nAxel Tuanzebe is also being assessed after pulling out of Sunday's game just before kick-off with a hip injury sustained in the warm-up.", "description": "CHRIS WHEELER: Man United's draw with Liverpool was either a demonstration of real potential from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side or another two points dropped in what is a frustrating season.", "authors": ["Chris Wheeler For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/01/20013796-0-image-a-5_1571702803233.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
