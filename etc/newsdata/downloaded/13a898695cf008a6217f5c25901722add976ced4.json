They are chock full of auto parts destined for one of two nearby GM plants: Hoods and painted body panels for Chevrolet Camaros; and hinges, hubcaps and exhaust systems for Cadillac sedans, Buick SUVs and Chevys.\n\nThe automaker itself has already lost more than $1 billion in earnings before interest and taxes, according to one analyst estimate. GM\u2019s bigger parts suppliers are losing as much as $2m a day by the same measurement. Workers at smaller parts makers across the US are sending employees home.\n\n\n\nIn Michigan, parts workers furloughed by the walkout do not get strike pay and just this week began receiving state unemployment benefits that max out at $342 a week -- not enough for most of his co-workers to live on, Luna said.\n\nStriking workers at GM get even less from a UAW rainy day fund, just $250 a week.\n\n\n\nIn a letter to members dated Friday, Terry Dittes, the union\u2019s vice president in charge of talks with GM, said \u201cgood progress\u201d has been made negotiating issues such as healthcare and the treatment of temporary workers, but others like job security and wages remain sticking points.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work over the weekend in an attempt to reach a tentative agreement,\u201d Dittes wrote.\n\nLost Profit\n\nThe strike is costing Axle and Lear Corp., another big supplier, $2m a day each while the toll on parts-maker Tenneco Inc. is $1m daily, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak.\n\n\n\nGM and its suppliers can make up some production once the strike ends, but not all of it. So some profit will either be lost or shifted to next year.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are getting to the point where it will be difficult to recover the lost production this year,\u201d Spak wrote in a research note. \u201cIn some respects, that makes the remainder of 2019 somewhat of a throwaway for the group and could shift the focus to 2020.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom the union\u2019s perspective, GM turned out record profits over the life of the expired four-year deal and CEO Mary Barra made more than $66m. It wants a pay raise, especially for newer employees who start at less than $20 an hour, and a clear path for temporary workers to become full-timers making $30 an hour.\n\n\n\nGM is looking to hold costs down, arguing that its current total compensation package of $63 an hour is already more than that offered by Ford, Fiat Chrysler and the Japanese plants in the U.S.\n\n\n\nWhile the two sides wrestle over those and a few other issues, furloughed parts workers struggle to make do. At Ryder and most of the smaller suppliers, workers make around $15 an hour.\n\nUnion leader Luna said he cautioned workers a year ago to save for the strike. But at that wage, which equates to $31,000 a year without overtime, many workers live check to check.\n\n\n\nSome employees have gone to the United Way and other charities for help with buying food and other essentials, he said. A few have applied for new jobs, but that\u2019s a tough sell.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are trying to get work,\u201d Luna said, \u201cbut then you have to tell an employer that when the strike ends, you would go back.\u201d", "description": "Soon to enter its fourth week, the strike is rippling across the economy, from parts suppliers in Michigan and Canada to bars, restaurants and other businesses that serve employees who now find themselves tight on cash", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2489/07726450f5384fd8ac78f7d6d89ce9d8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
