REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier\n\nMARSEILLE, France (Reuters) - The main cruise ship operators in French waters have agreed on measures to limit pollution caused by their vessels, including hooking up to the power grid instead of keeping their engines running during stopovers.\n\nThe \u201cBlue Charter\u201d agreement signed in Marseille by Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises, Royal Carribean Cruises and Ponant also pledged to use less-polluting fuel when maneuvering in harbors as well as other measures to reduce emissions.\n\nThe four signatories transport 95% of the passengers and account for 85% of the stopovers in Marseille, which is France\u2019s number one cruise ship port and the fourth-biggest in the Mediterranean, with 1.75 million passengers last year and a target of 2 million in 2020.\n\nThe move comes ahead of new regulations from the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which will require all ocean-going ships to reduce the sulfur content in fuels used in their vessels from Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nThe economic benefits of the cruise industry for Marseille are estimated at about 350 million euros ($389 million) a year and include about 3,000 jobs, but local residents\u2019 associations have long fought pollution from cruise ships.\n\nAccording to official local data, fumes emitted by cruise ship chimneys are responsible for 40% of the area\u2019s nitrogen oxide emissions, 32% of the sulfur dioxide emissions and 15% of its particulate matter pollution.\n\nLast month Mediterranean resort town Cannes, France\u2019s fourth-biggest cruise ship port, said it would ban the most-polluting cruise ships from next year in an attempt to boost air quality in the city.", "description": "The main cruise ship operators in French waters have agreed on measures to limit pollution caused by their vessels, including hooking up to the power grid instead of keeping their engines running during stopovers.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441906727&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1EA", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
