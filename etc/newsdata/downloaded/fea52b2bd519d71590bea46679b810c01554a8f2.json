It is offering 58 million shares in the IPO, which would raise $135 million. The company is also offering underwriters a 30-day option to buy an additional 8.8 million shares.\n\nThe back story. Founded in 2014, SmileDirectClub sells direct-to-consumer teeth-straightening treatments. The product has faced criticism from orthodontists, as the company\u2019s model cuts out visits to the dentist\u2019s office. It is one of a handful of direct-to-consumer invisible-aligner companies seeking to dominate the growing market.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\nWhat\u2019s new. When it begins trading, SmileDirect Club will join competitor Align Technology (ticker: ALGN), a pioneer in the invisible-aligner market, which went public in 2001. The company\u2019s patents began expiring in 2017, clearing the way for a wave of competitors. Unlike Align, which sells its Invisalign product through orthodontist\u2019s offices, SmileDirect and other private companies like Candid Co. employ a direct-to-consumer model.\n\nShares of Align technology are down 52.6% over the past 12 months. The stock peaked at $391 in July 2018, but has fallen sharply since then.\n\nSmileDirectClub clients visit the company\u2019s retail stores to be fitted with their aligners, or can use a mail-in kit. A SmileDirectClub doctor approves the treatment plan remotely, and prescribes the aligners.\n\nSmileDirect says it is poised to benefit from a growing awareness of \u201caesthetic image\u201d among consumers. \u201cThe proliferation of social media emphasizes online identity and, as a result, drives consumers to present an image of their best selves,\u201d the company said in a September filing. \u201cWithin the next 12 months, more than one in three adults in the U.S. are considering at least one cosmetic treatment, with cosmetic dentistry (including teeth alignment, whitening, and veneers) topping the list of nonsurgical treatments.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead. Investors will determine today whether the company is worth the $23 sticker price, after company executives ring the Nasdaq opening bell. SmileDirect will trade under the ticker SDC.\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "SmileDirectClub, which sells see-through orthodontic braces, begins trading on the Nasdaq this morning after pricing its initial public offering at $23 on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Josh Nathan-Kazis"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106505/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
