In May, a federal judge ordered Anheuser-Busch to stop using language related to corn syrup in its advertising - and in September, a judge told Anheuser-Busch that it could no longer use the phrase \u201cno corn syrup\u201d on its packaging.\n\nWith the new lawsuit, Anheuser-Busch are asking for punitive damages against MillerCoors, in addition to the return of the secret recipes.\n\nHowever, MillerCoors has downplayed the allegations, and accused the rival brewer of attempting to transfer attention away from themselves.\n\n\u201cMillerCoors respects confidential information and takes any contrary allegations seriously, but if the ingredients are a secret, why did they spend tens of millions of dollars telling the entire world what's in Bud Light?\u201d a MillerCoors spokesperson told CNN. \u201cAnd why are the ingredients printed on Bud Light\u2019s packaging in giant letters?\n\n\u201cAnheuser-Busch has lost three major federal rulings in this case and now they are simply trying to distract from the basic fact that they intentionally misled American consumers.\u201d\n\nThe Independent has contacted Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors for comment.", "description": "An ongoing legal battle between two rival beer companies has escalated after one accused the other of obtaining its secret recipes.\u00a0 On Thursday, Anheuser-Busch InBev, the makers of Budweiser,\u00a0filed a lawsuit against MillerCoors on the basis that the competitor\u00a0had obtained \u201cprecise recipes\u201d for its beers\u00a0Bud Light and\u00a0Michelob\u00a0Ultra.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/18/17/istock-515786185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
