But it quickly embraced the 10 years contained in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement as a major improvement, especially in the Mexican market.\n\nA lengthy protection period, PhRMA argues, ensures innovation in medicines because it allows companies to recoup research and development costs before the intellectual property used to make the drugs is open to competition.\n\nBut many Democrats, backing arguments made by manufacturers of cheaper generic medications, want USMCA to provide earlier access to proprietary test data used to develop biologics, in order to increase competition and lower prices for patients \u2014 a key political issue on both sides of the aisle.\n\nManufacturers of generic drugs contend that technological advances are reducing the amount of time it takes drug companies to bring new biologic medicines to market, and that lengthy exclusivity periods guarantee high prices for patients. They want the protection period to be shortened, and two key Democrats negotiating with the administration to make changes to USMCA want it dropped altogether.\n\nThe biologics provision is one of four key issues raised by Democrats standing in the way of congressional approval of USMCA, the Trump administration's top legislative priority this year. The other issues involve Democratic demands for improvements to the enforceability of the agreement and for stronger commitments on labor and the environment.\n\n\"In terms of the prescription drugs, that's a very big issue in our caucus, and we hope that we can resolve that,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday at her weekly news conference.\n\n\"We feel very good about being on a path to yes,\" Pelosi added. \"We're not there yet because we don't have the enforceability assurance that we need to have.\"\n\nThe stakes are increasingly high: Access to affordable medicines is shaping up to be an important issue in the 2020 campaign, and biologic drugs, which have grown to take on a large share of the pharmaceutical market, are much more expensive than other medicines.\n\n\u201cWhile less than 2 percent of Americans use biologics, they represent 40 percent of total spending on prescription drugs,\u201d then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a speech last year outlining the Trump administration's plans to incentivize production of cheaper alternatives known as \u201cbiosimilars.\u201d\n\nThe 10-year exclusivity period in USMCA represents the longest such term in any free trade agreement to date and two years more than Canada now provides.\n\nIt would also double Mexico\u2019s five-year protection period and strengthen its enforcement. That would satisfy another demand of brand-name manufacturers, who have complained that previous Mexican governments have not reliably policed the period of market exclusivity.\n\nThe USMCA talks between Trump's chief trade negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and nine Democrats handpicked by Pelosi have gone on for months. But Republicans are pressuring Pelosi to quickly wrap up the negotiations and schedule a vote on the pact. Those demands have gotten even louder after Democrats opened an impeachment inquiry against Trump, which has raised concern that the USMCA could get sidelined.\n\nAt her news conference on Thursday, Pelosi bristled at the suggestion that Democrats have been dragging their feet, but she also suggested the talks could soon come to a close.\n\n\u201cI can honestly say that I think every day we're becoming closer,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI think they're going to meet later today, perhaps one more time \u2014 and then we should just see. The issue is: Do we have enforcement?\"\n\nAs the pressure has increased in the USMCA talks, both PhRMA and the Association for Accessible Medicines, a trade group representing makers of generic medicines, have been busy visiting congressional offices, to plead their case with lawmakers.", "description": "Brand-name drug manufacturers were one of the earliest supporters of the new North American trade deal, but now the industry\u2019s prized provision is in danger of being weakened as President Donald Trump tries to get the agreement through Congress.
