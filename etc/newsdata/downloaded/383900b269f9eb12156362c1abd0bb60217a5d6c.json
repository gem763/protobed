The surge was driven by September corporate tax payments, which were due Monday and expected to pull $75 billion to $100 billion out of markets, resulting in lower demand for government notes and pushing up rates.\n\n\"Sustained federal funds rate pressure will likely raise questions about the Fed's ability to control money markets, especially as the federal funds rate approaches the upper end of the Fed's target range,\" Cubana wrote in a report.\n\nThat level, set by the central bank's monetary policy committee at its meeting at the end of July, is set to be reviewed this week amid indications that U.S. economic growth is slowing and pressure from President Trump to buoy it with a \"big\" rate cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe current U.S. expansion has spanned more than 10 years, making it the longest in the country's history, and sparking market speculation that a slump is due soon. Already, gross domestic product growth sagged to 2 percent mid-year, down from 3.1 percent at the start of 2019, and may drop lower.\n\nAdditionally, auto sales have dropped 2.4 percent and industrial production has shrunk 0.8 percent, a worse performance by both indicators than in most of the seven recessions since the 1960s, according to Bank of America. Economists have blamed the slowdown, in part, on a trade war with China initiated by the Trump administration, which has driven up supply costs for U.S. companies, forcing some to choose between raising prices and laying off workers.\n\nMany have delayed plans to add employees or build new plants, prompting warnings from lawmakers that Trump risked undermining the benefits of GOP-led tax cuts in late 2017, which could erode the economic performance that had been widely viewed as a strength in his reelection campaign.\n\nThe president has largely rejected such claims, instead accusing the Fed -- and Jerome Powell, the chairman that he appointed -- of curbing U.S. growth by raising interest rates too quickly. The central bank boosted short-term rates four times in 2018, taking them to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, before pulling back in July.\n\nTrading in interest rate futures tracked by CME Group indicates a 47 percent chance the bank's monetary policy committee will cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday. The odds of a larger cut have dropped to nil from 22 percent a month ago.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The Federal Reserve will consider reducing its benchmark rate this week.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/ny-fed-building-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
