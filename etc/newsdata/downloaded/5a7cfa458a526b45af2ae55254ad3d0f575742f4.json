His wife, Jeanne, is sitting right there by the way. She doesn\u2019t mind. I should stress one thing (in fairness to all concerned): Bloom and Suzman have never met. Unless you count across a very crowded auditorium. She was playing Cleopatra at the National Theatre some time in the late 1970s. Harold Bloom was in the audience (as, by a strange coincidence, was I). For Harold, it was the coup de foudre. He was too shaken by the whole experience to ever articulate his passion, until a year or two back when I finally put the two of them in touch, over email.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

She will remain forever exactly as she was on stage, dressed as an Egyptian queen, her words precisely scripted by William Shakespeare. It is the purest love you can imagine, a literary love affair, based on highly metaphorical language. Cleopatra was in love with Anthony, but for at least that one evening Bloom was Anthony, even though he generally thinks of himself as more of a Falstaff, a hedonistic lover of life and adventurer.\n\nHarold is not in great shape. He can\u2019t go very far, physically speaking, except for regular trips to the hospital and a rehab clinic. He is wheelchair-bound. His wife says it\u2019s all down to a weak heart and arthritis. He has a nurse attending him while I\u2019m there. He calls out for ice to be put on his back. His hand is trembling as he signs a copy of his book. The last time he wrote to me, he said, with an apocalyptic air, \u201cmy future is indeterminate\u201d. Which applies to us all, but especially to Harold.\n\nHis word for himself is \u201cdecrepit\u201d. His mind is as sharp as ever it was, but inside a body that is in terminal decline. He is suffering from the opposite of dementia: decorporia, or physical disintegration. Mens sana in a corpore that is anything but sano. \u201cThere is a tremor in my fingers,\u201d he writes, \u201cmy legs tend to give out, my teeth diminish, incipient macular degeneration dims my eyes, deafness increases, birdsong is scarcely heard, every height augments my apprehension of falling.\u201d When he thinks about death, he quotes Dr Johnson: \u201cThis secret horrour of the last is inseparable from a thinking being whose life is limited, and to whom death is dreadful.\u201d\n\nThere is a strange bond between us. My father\u2019s name is also Harold. Middle name \u201cHoratio\u201d, which Bloom in his Shakespearean way is particularly fond of. \u201cI\u2019m old enough to be your father,\u201d he says. I\u2019m a bit of a prodigal symbolic son though. I struggle to remember the books my own father was particularly keen on. \u201cHe was more into motorbikes than books, to be honest,\u201d I say.\n\nI can do the things that Harold can no longer do: hiking up the mountains of Montana or surfing. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever get tired?\u201d he says. In fact he hates going to the beach anyway: \u201cI turn into a lobster when exposed to the sun.\u201d He is content to keep on reading and keep on remembering.\n\nThere is an implicit and explicit shoutout in his work to Proust\u2019s In Search of Lost Time, merging memory and art with an evanescent impression of immortality. His earliest memory is of playing on the floor of his mother\u2019s kitchen while she prepared the Sabbath meal. As she goes by he reaches out and touches her toes; she reaches down and rumples his hair and says, \u201cMy sweet Harry\u201d.\n\nNow, approaching the end of his story, he likes to quote the Book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 12: \u201cAlso when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the street.\u201d A line in Ecclesiastes which I\u2019ve never heard him quote is this one: \u201cMuch study is a weariness of the flesh.\u201d He adheres to the later Jewish tradition (perhaps imported via neoplatonism) of study being the path to salvation.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

So he came at it from the outside, rather like Joseph Conrad or Vladimir Nabokov, and was (and remains) bewitched by the language.\n\nHis first reading was of the poets William Blake and Hart Crane, and he came to Shakespeare very early on, around the age of eight or nine he thinks. \u201cWhen I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for me.\u201d Legend has it that he could read a thousand pages an hour (he says it was only 400 at best).\n\nWhen I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for me Harold Bloom in Possessed By Memory\n\nHe retains his youthful magical thinking about literature. Bloom has now written 40-something books about books \u2013 poetry, novels, plays, sacred texts. And his \u201cmemoir\u201d is largely a homage to some of his favourite writers. As Oscar Wilde once said: \u201cCriticism is the only civilised form of autobiography.\u201d Bloom harks back to the Bible often enough, but he is (as he describes Marcel Proust) more of \u201can atheistic mystic\u201d. He quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson with approval: \u201cAs men\u2019s prayers are a disease of their will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect.\n\nLiterature is the closest thing Harold has to a religion. Writers such as Shakespeare and Milton and Wordsworth are like a substitute for the elusive Yahweh of the book of Genesis. Which explains why he retains an essentially sacred view of writing and is concerned to defend the \u201cwestern canon\u201d (from Homer through to James Joyce) against unbelievers and sceptics (which probably includes me).\n\nHis attitude could be summed up in the opening lines of John\u2019s Gospel: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word (logos), and the Word was with God (theon), and the Word was God.\u201d But he was brought up on the Torah, the Jewish Bible, and was later seduced by the medieval tradition of Kabbalah, which says that the world was called into being via 10 utterances (or \u201cSefirot\u201d) and that therefore the whole of life is language. Organised religion, monotheism-style, derived from a reverence for the written text.\n\nBloom derives consolation from the books that surround him on shelves and in piles on the table and on the floor. In Possessed by Memory, he writes that \u201cFrequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in (Wallace) Stevens at his strongest.\u201d If he was a Pharaoh, he would presumably ask to be buried with his books at his side.\n\nHe met his wife Jeanne in New Haven in 1955. They were both students at Yale. She was doing a degree in history, he had just returned from a year on a Fulbright scholarship at Pembroke College, Cambridge (England). They married in 1958. Now, more than 60 years later, she says: \u201cYou can\u2019t stop him. Nothing would stop him from continuing to teach and write \u2013 it\u2019s what he does.\u201d\n\nHe tends to remember people according to the books or poems they make him think of. So for example, there was a student called Fergy he met at Cornell. She was from Kentucky. \u201cShe had freckles and red hair, and I always told her that she looked like a female Huck Finn. Tall, slim, incredibly graceful, she had a way of running around me as we walked, since she was swift and I was slow.\u201d Everything is mediated through literature. \u201cAlmost every night I dream about departed friends, sometimes mixing them up with fictive characters.\u201d\n\nAt this stage of the game \u2013 the dreaded \u201ctwilight\u201d zone \u2013 Bloom has lost most of his old friends. His books are a way of calling them back again. The notion of a resurrection is still important to him \u2013 but one that precedes death. It is not surprising, when his own body is failing, if he finds consolation in images of transcendence, in which the soul is at last disembodied:\n\nHence in a season of calm weather\n\nThough inland far we be\n\nOur souls have sight of that immortal sea\n\nWhich brought us hither,\n\nCan in a moment travel thither,\n\nAnd see the children sport upon the shore,\n\nAnd hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.\n\n(Wordsworth, Intimations of Immortality).\n\nHe quotes from Proust\u2019s account of the death of (his imaginary writer) Bergotte: \u201cThey buried him, but all through that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged three by three, kept vigil like angels with outspread wings and seemed, for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection\u201d.\n\nThere are perhaps three key concepts that recur again and again in Bloom: freedom, God, and immortality. All three of them appear as delusions, but ones that can be elusively attained or at least entertained in works of literature. Bloom would probably concur with Borges that literature is defined by \u201cthe sense of the imminence of a revelation that does not occur\u201d.\n\nNone of which stops Bloom from forever searching, not just for his own earliest memories but what might be something like the earliest memories of humanity, for what he calls, \u201ca primal sound, cast out of our cosmos and wandering in exile through the interstellar spaces\u201d. One of the stories he is most drawn to in the Old Testament \u2013 the Book of Genesis \u2013 is that of Jacob, who finds himself wrestling with a passing god all through the night. Bloom sees that \u2013 a close encounter with the divine \u2013 as an allegory of his own life.\n\n\u201cIn the half-light of my incessant nocturnal wakefulness, I begin to conceive of it as the struggle of every solitary deep reader to find in the highest literature what will suffice.\u201d\n\nFrequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in (Wallace) Stevens at his strongest\n\nThe \u201cmost important thing in the book\u201d he says is his theory of \u201cself-other seeing\u201d, notably in Shakespeare, where characters like Hamlet and Macbeth are capable of seeing themselves from the outside, as if they were someone else \u2013 an idea to some extent inspired or inflected by the experience he has had when (more than once) falling and breaking some fragile part of his body: \u201cI recall the repetition of an acute phantasmagoria that this was not happening to me but to some other person.\u201d\n\nOne of his favourite words is agon, nothing to do with \u201cagony\u201d as such, but definitely concerned with struggle, as if in an arena (like Ben Hurr). He is certainly always struggling with something or someone, whether god or man, or just entropy in general.\n\n\n\nMy own theory is that, in the current context, his definition of a serious book would be anything that can\u2019t be readily made into a movie or a video game (Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake springs to mind.) Books are old school and contrive to hold new school technology at bay. \u201cThe final book here, The Book of Numbers, by the still-youthful Joshua Cohen, is a courageous assault on our Age of the Screen, the great grey ocean of the internet.\u201d\n\nI quote that from Bright Book of Life: Fifty-Two Novels to Reread \u2018Ere I Vanish. While I was hanging out chez Bloom, as well as emailing Dame Janet, I also had to email myself the manuscripts of two other books that Harold has already written but not yet published.\n\n\n\nOne is Bright Book, the other is Take Arms Against a Sea of Troubles, a study of poetry, or \u201cthe power of the reader\u2019s mind over a universe of death\u201d. As his wife says, there is no stopping him. Each book is a way of deferring death, a bulwark against the erosion of time, a \u201csymbol of his resurrection\u201d.\n\nIn all writers and all times, in philosophers and poets, Bloom finds consolation \u2013 companionship \u2013 in the face of the void. But if you had to name one, it would have to be Shakespeare, and precariously poised as he is between being and non-being, it would have to be in the figure of Hamlet: \u201cWe defy augury. There\u2019s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be, \u2018tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; it if be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man, of aught he leaves, knows aught, what is\u2019t to leave betimes? Let be.\u201d\n\nAndy Martin is the author of With Child: Lee Child and the Readers of Jack Reacher (Polity) and teaches at the University of Cambridge", "description": "For a moment or two, I got to be Harold Bloom.\u00a0\u201cAndy, you understand about computers, don\u2019t you?\u201d says he. \u201cSit down in front of that computer and send an email for me.\u201d\u00a0Which is how I came to sign myself \u201cHarold\u201d.
