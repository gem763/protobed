During her trip, the Princess of Wales met Tigica, who was 13 at the time.\n\nThe two were pictured together in a widely-seen photograph, seated under a tree at an orthopedic workshop in Luanda.\n\nTim Graham via Getty Images Princess Diana meets Sandra Tigica at an orthopedic workshop in Luanda, Angola, in 1997.\n\nHarry reunited with Tigica, now a mother in her late 30s, on Friday. The Duke of Sussex had previously been introduced to Tigica; the two met at an event honoring Diana in London in 2007.\n\n\u201cYou still look as young as you did in those pictures, all those years ago,\u201d Harry told Tigica on Friday, according to video taken by The Sun.\n\nHe later asked, \u201cAre you happy with the progress that has been made since then ... with the clearing of minefields?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m very happy with all the work that took place, and I\u2019m very happy to see that you\u2019re following her footsteps,\u201d Tigica responded via an English-speaking translator.\n\nPool/Samir Hussein via Getty Images Prince Harry meets with Tigica as part of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's royal tour.\n\nDuring his visit to Angola, which is part of his royal tour, the Duke of Sussex retraced his mother\u2019s footsteps, walking the same path that Diana did 22 years ago, on what is now a completely transformed street.\n\n\u201cThe Duke was able to walk the same path, but now rather than walking amongst mines, he was able to walk among a bustling community with schools, colleges and small businesses,\u201d a post\u2019s caption on the Sussex Royal Instagram page read.\n\nHarry also joined the HALO Trust, a landmine clearance organization, on a walk through a de-mining field in Dirico, Angola. The 35-year-old royal wore protective body armor and headgear similar to what Diana wore in Huambo over two decades ago.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex called the mines, left during Angola\u2019s civil war, \u201can unhealed scar of war,\u201d according to The New York Times.", "description": "The Duke of Sussex and Sandra Tigica discussed the progress that has been made to clear minefields, 22 years after Princess Diana's visit.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8fc5982100005b00fd1045.jpeg?cache=ay4kxnqs1r&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
