The shocking loss could be a sign of an ecological crisis, scientists said Thursday.\n\nAccording to a new study published in the journal Science by top ornithologists and government agencies, even common birds such as sparrows and blackbirds have faced declines in North America since 1970.\n\n\"It's staggering,\" said lead author Ken Rosenberg, a conservation scientist at the Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology.\n\nResearchers studied 529 bird species over the last half-century to compile the most comprehensive study ever done on North American birds, the journal said. Thanks to the decades of monitoring by researchers and bird enthusiasts across the continent \u2014 as well as weather radars \u2014 scientists had a huge amount of data to work with.\n\nWhat they found was unexpected. While scientists believed rarer species would be declining, they assumed more common species would be on the rise due to their resilience as well as conservation efforts. But the declines have far outweighed the gains.\n\n\"We expected to see continuing declines of threatened species,\" Rosenberg said. \"But for the first time, the results also showed pervasive losses among common birds across all habitats, including backyard birds.\"\n\nGrassland birds such as meadowlarks and northern bobwhites have declined by 53% since 1970 \u2014 a loss of 700 million adults in the 31 species studied. Shorebirds such as sanderlings and plovers are down by about one-third, according to the study.\n\n\"There's an erosion of the numbers of common birds,\" Rosenberg said. Indeed, 19 common species have lost more than 50 million birds in the last 50 years. Birds such as sparrows, warblers, finches and blackbirds have been hit particularly hard, the study found.\n\nNorth America has lost nearly 3 billion birds since 1970.

Pesticide use, climate change and predators could also be contributing to the decline.\n\n\"This is being caused entirely by humans. Habitat loss, which is the primary driver here, is a human-caused issue,\" said the study's co-author Peter Marra, director of the Georgetown Environment Initiative.\n\nSeven ways to help save birds. Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n\nBirds are indicator species, acting as a measurement for overall environmental health. Scientists fear the decline signals a major crisis, since birds play a part in controlling the spread of plants and insects.\n\n\"It's imperative to address immediate and ongoing threats, both because the domino effects can lead to the decay of ecosystems that humans depend on for our own health and livelihoods \u2014 and because people all over the world cherish birds in their own right,\" Marra said. \"Can you imagine a world without birdsong?\"\n\nThe western meadowlark is the state bird of six states: Montana, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and Wyoming. Matthew Pendleton, Macaulay Library at Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n\nAccording to a comprehensive U.N. report published in May, one million species of plants and animals are currently at risk of extinction. More than half a million species on land \"have insufficient habitat for long-term survival\" and are likely to go extinct, many within decades, unless their habitats are restored.\n\nFighting climate change and saving species are equally important, the report said.\n\nThe new study did find a few species of birds that have rebounded from decline and started to thrive. Waterfowl such as ducks, geese and swans and raptors such as bald eagles have made significant recoveries thanks to government funding and protection efforts.\n\nIf nothing else, scientists hope the concerning statistics will encourage people to pay more attention to birds. \"It might stir needed action in light of the public interest in our feathered friends,\" Stanford University ecologist Paul Ehrlich said.\n\nMillion animals, plants at risk of extinction due to human activities, U.N. report says\n\nAccording to the American Bird Conservancy, strengthening protections for birds at the government level may be the best way to protect them. Defending and strengthening the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, increasing funding for programs to protect habitats, enacting the Recovering America's Wildlife Act and advancing climate solutions may help reverse the decline.\n\n\"The story is not over,\" said co-author Michael Parr, president of American Bird Conservancy. \"There are so many ways to help save birds. Some require policy decisions such as strengthening the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We can also work to ban harmful pesticides and properly fund effective bird conservation programs. Each of us can make a difference with everyday actions that together can save the lives of millions of birds \u2014 actions like making windows safer for birds, keeping cats indoors, and protecting habitat.\"", "description": "The shocking loss could be a sign of an ecological crisis, scientists said Thursday", "authors": ["Sophie Lewis"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/19/7c74f3dc-b708-4f93-b5cd-887069b9ea8c/thumbnail/1200x630/52f922893351fe38f9d70f1e62bd7a01/western-meadowlark-by-matthew-pendleton-macaulay-library-at-cornell-lab-of-ornithology-52661031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
