To do so, his team enlisted the help of the kids-entertainment company Pocket.Watch.\n\nPocket.Watch takes brands that start on YouTube and gets them in front of kids in multiple arenas.\n\n\"Most creators are creating out of their homes and really good at what they do in mobilizing audiences through great content,\" Kerry Tucker, the chief marketing officer at Pocket.Watch, told Business Insider. \"Behind that, they are not seasoned professionals who know how to take themselves off of YouTube and into other things, or even that they have the opportunity to do that.\"\n\nThe company thinks of itself as a full-service entertainment studio, like a smaller scale Disney or Nickelodeon for internet creators, she said.\n\nIt targets Generation Alpha (zero to 9) and works with a small group of internet creators, like HobbyKids TV (3.7 million subscribers), CaptainSparklez (10.7 million subscribers), EvanTubeHD (6 million subscribers), and JillianTubeHD (1.5 million subscribers).\n\nHobbyKids Adventures is an animated web TV series produced by Pocket.Watch for YouTube. Pocket.Watch\n\nFrom a self-produced YouTube channel to a multimillion-dollar franchise\n\nPocket.Watch wants its creators to be on the screens kids are watching and the toys they pick up after the screen is turned off.\n\n\"Everything from toys to toothbrushes to television shows,\" Tucker said.\n\nTake 8-year-old Ryan, whose channel started from occasional five-minute toy-unboxing videos in 2015. Pocket.Watch acts as an agent for Ryan's brand, Ryan's World, and has invested in building an empire around the YouTube star.\n\nThe company brought the Ryan's World brand to Colgate, Nickelodeon, Bonkers Toys, Roku, and Walmart, expanding Ryan from YouTube.\n\nTucker credits Bonkers, the toy-manufacturing company that produced the Ryan's World Giant Mystery Egg, with Ryan ToysReview branding, for taking the first \"leap of faith\" with Ryan.\n\nRead more: Inside the toy business of YouTube star Ryan ToysReview, the 8-year-old boy who makes $22 million per year\n\nSince then, Pocket.Watch has developed over 100 licensees, from launching an entire line of Ryan's World consumer products with Bonkers, to creating and producing \"Ryan's Mystery Playdate,\" which airs on Nickelodeon.\n\nRyan Kaji's YouTube channel Ryan ToysReview has 22 million subscribers. Bonkers Toys\n\nBuilding partnerships with major retailers like Walmart and Target, and media companies like Nickelodeon and Roku\n\nPocket.Watch works closely with Nickelodeon, Walmart, Target, and Amazon, looking at data and trends to see what's working and where to move next, Tucker said. The company relies on its partnerships.\n\nThose partnerships start with thinking about the audience, Tucker said. Where does this generation live? What do they want from content and characters?\n\n\"It's not so different from the past,\" Tucker said. \"They want them on their toothbrushes, backpacks, and other screens in their homes.\"\n\nTucker said Pocket.Watch tracks data on Generation Alpha to stay ahead of the curve and listens closely to what kids are consuming.\n\nRyan. Pocket.Watch\n\nTrends and challenges\n\nThe biggest challenge is saying no to things that aren't \"brand right,\" Tucker said, and keeping up with the pace.\n\nChallenges rise any time YouTube or Google changes something internally, she said. But the company has a strong relationship with Google and will \"always know what is happening a little bit ahead of time,\" which is common among big YouTube-focused companies. Managers with tight relationships with Google get word of news beforehand to prepare clients, for instance.\n\nShe said Pocket.Watch was anticipating changes to Google within the next year that could affect its kids-focused creators.\n\nEarlier this year, one complaint was made with the FTC against Ryan ToysReview, who was accused of \"deceiving\" the young audience with sponsored content.\n\nBut Pocket.Watch isn't worried, Tucker said.\n\n\"Certainly anything that protects the safety and wellness for kids is good,\" she said. \"We are all good with the regulations, we just want to make sure our creators can navigate it well, and also, it showcases how diversifying their revenue streams is important.\"\n\nIf a creator were solely dependent on YouTube, and something happens \u2014 from restrictions to new platform regulations \u2014 that could hurt business. YouTube creators should be moving onto new platforms and building businesses outside YouTube to protect themselves, she said.\n\nThat is also, conveniently, Pocket.Watch's specialty.\n\nCheck out these Business Insider Prime posts for more on Ryan ToysReview:", "description": "Pocket.Watch turns YouTube channels into multifaceted businesses through partnerships with companies like Walmart, Amazon, and Nickelodeon.", "authors": ["Amanda Perelli"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4cd094af9091af83c9f93?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
