Their insight could be helpful to Democrats hoping to learn more about the dual strategies that the U.S. was taking on Ukraine \u2014 the official one and the operation that multiple officials have told lawmakers hinged on the country investigating political rivals of the president.\n\nIt's unclear if either of the officials plans to show up for their scheduled appearances. The Trump administration has attempted to block various witnesses Democrats have called before them, including one witness earlier this week who filed a lawsuit in hopes that the courts could help guide witnesses as the legislative and executive branch face off.\n\nCNN reported that both Croft and Anderson worked under then-Special Envoy for Ukraine Kurt Volker, who has emerged as a key witness in the impeachment investigation.\n\nCroft's background includes work on Ukraine for both the State Department and the National Security Council, the outlet reported. Similarly, Anderson's resume includes working at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.\n\nMore: House resolution outlines public phase of impeachment inquiry, gives GOP subpoena powers\n\nThe two are scheduled to follow Tuesday's testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an Army officer and the Trump administration's top Ukraine expert who in prepared testimony said he was \"concerned\" by Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 which helped launch the impeachment inquiry after it was discovered the president brought up military aid for the country then asked about an investigation into political rival Joe Biden.\n\nMore: 'I was concerned': Trump's top Ukraine expert to tell impeachment investigators he reported troubling conduct twice to superiors\n\nLater on Wednesday, the House Rules Committee will examine a resolution that sets procedures for the House's impeachment inquiry as it moves into the next phase \u2014 which will be public.\n\nRepublicans have attacked the resolution, calling it unfair to them and the president. The hearing is expected to be contentious, allowing Republicans and Democrats to face-off in front of cameras on the impeachment effort.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Live Trump impeachment inquiry coverage: Two State Department officials to testify", "description": "Two State Department officials who serve as experts on Ukraine are\u00a0scheduled to appear before lawmakers investigating in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Christal Hayes", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tgkOmxj5A70wHDCfkgfocw--~B/aD0yNzkxO3c9NDE4NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/84508b8155ed6735547f0639ff125990", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
