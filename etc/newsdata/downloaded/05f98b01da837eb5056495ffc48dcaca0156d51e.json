Uber, viewed by The Washington Post offer a rare glimpse at Uber\u2019s strategies for using drivers\u2019 status as independent contractors as a legal shield. Asked in a document to \u201cadmit or deny that Uber is in the business of providing transportation,\u201d the ride-hailing company\u2019s attorneys are steadfast: \u201cdenied.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOver the course of a nearly three-hour deposition in the Harris case, Uber executive Nicholas Valentino, then an operations manager for Atlanta, repeatedly corrected the plaintiff\u2019s attorney when he referred to the contractors as \u201cdrivers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are not Uber drivers,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cThey\u2019re independent, third-party transportation providers.\u201d He repeated the claim no fewer than 16 times, to the attorney\u2019s apparent consternation.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to keep saying they are not drivers, we are just going to be fussing about that all afternoon,\u201d said the attorney, Michael Todd Wheeles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Valentino said.\n\nUber faces many lawsuits, over issues ranging from fender benders to wage disputes to more-serious incidents. Harris sued Uber and driver Robert Ferguson, alleging that she nearly lost her leg after being struck by Ferguson, who she claimed veered off the road.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAt stake for Uber in its many court battles is the potential for millions in new liabilities if its contract drivers are reclassified as employees, and the company is found to bear greater responsibility for their actions.\n\nMany companies rely on contractors and gig workers. But what sets Uber and other ride-hailing companies apart is that its customers spend much more time with the drivers, en route to their destination, compared with, say, food-delivery or dog-walking services. The ratio of contractors to direct employees is high: While Uber has roughly 4 million drivers, the company has 27,000 employees.\n\nIn public statements, Uber takes pains to show its collaborative relationship with drivers. Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi refers to them as \u201cdriver partners,\u201d noting in an interview last October that \u201cif you\u2019re going to call your drivers partners, then treat them like partners.\u201d Uber declared 2017 \u201cthe year of the driver\u201d before it was embroiled in a series of corporate scandals. The company offered some drivers the chance to buy stock when it went public in May, and it hosts regular forums where drivers can give feedback to executives.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDrivers are independent contractors,\u201d Uber spokesman Noah Edwardsen said in a statement. \u201cBut that has never stopped us from making significant investments in safety. Safety will always be a long-term commitment for Uber and we will continue working to raise the bar to help protect everyone who uses our platform.\u201d\n\nGig workers earn money by performing tasks such as delivering groceries, ferrying passengers or fetching prepared food \u2014 tasks generally arranged by customers through mobile apps. Because they are not full-time employees, they can log in to the app whenever they wish to work, but they also have to pay for things such as fuel and health insurance themselves.\n\nA measure in Uber\u2019s home state that could require it to reclassify drivers as employees, with benefits such as paid sick leave, could also open the company up to new liabilities, according to critics. Uber has pushed back against the measure \u2014 set to take effect in January \u2014 citing what it says may be the impact to drivers\u2019 flexible work schedule.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLiability is one of the big unspoken-about issues here,\u201d said Lorena Gonzalez (D), a California state assemblywoman who crafted the bill, known as AB5, that would make many gig workers employees. \u201cWe want to ensure there\u2019s responsibility at the end of the day and that they are not just passing that along to someone else.\"\n\nEdwardsen said that \u201cliability for safety incidents has simply never been part of [Uber\u2019s] arguments or strategy around AB5\u201d and that \u201csuggesting otherwise is wrong.\u201d\n\nUber declined to comment on the Harris case, which it settled out of court, or any other litigation. Attorneys for Harris also declined to comment, as did the driver\u2019s attorneys. Valentino, the Uber executive who was deposed in the case, declined through an Uber spokesman to be interviewed. Harris and Ferguson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nUber drivers\u2019 employment status has been challenged in multiple lawsuits, but Uber has avoided having to broadly recognize its gig workers as employees. Uber tends to favor settling individual cases out of court rather than letting them go to trial, say attorneys who have brought suits against the company.\n\nIn materials related to the Harris case, sealed after the matter was privately settled, Uber attorneys and executives contend that the company is nothing more than a marketplace that happens to be used for arranging transportation. And its chief legal officer, Tony West, said last month that Uber\u2019s business is \u201cserving as a technology platform for several different types of digital marketplaces.\u201d\n\nBut the company is more involved than many online marketplaces, such as e-commerce sites, including providing driving directions to drivers, setting fare rates and mandating punctuality and car type, among other criteria.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe distinction in the Harris case \u2014 and many others like it \u2014 is crucial for Uber. The company argues that because they are contractors, drivers and their behavior ultimately are not its responsibility.\n\nIt has made similar arguments in other lawsuits. In a case in San Francisco alleging an Uber driver made sexual comments to a 16-year-old passenger, settled in December, Uber\u2019s attorneys said that \u201cthe partner driver was an independent contractor responsible for his own means and methods\u201d and that Uber is \u201ca technology company, not a transportation company.\"\n\nIn a case underway in Walton County, Fla., where a driver purportedly drove a passenger to his home and raped her, Uber asserts that the driver \u201cwas at all times \u2026 an independent, third-party transportation provider\u201d and that Uber \u201cdoes not and did not employ\u201d the driver and \u201cnever had an agency, employment, partnership, joint venture or joint enterprise relationship with him.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCourts have generally sided with Uber and other companies reliant on gig workers that have made similar arguments.\n\nThe Post reported last month that Uber\u2019s Special Investigations Unit, which it turns to when trips go awry, is designed primarily to shelter the company from legal responsibility and quietly resolve serious allegations to avoid press or regulatory scrutiny. Uber has contested that, saying the unit\u2019s role is to \u201cprovide specialized customer support to riders and drivers dealing with very serious real-life situations.\u201d\n\nOnline marketplaces such as Uber and Lyft, e-commerce companies, food delivery companies and lodging providers have successfully argued that as middlemen they should not be held responsible for the goods and services they help arrange. And courts have generally sided with them, citing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields sites from legal liability for user content by treating them as distributors rather than publishers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGonzalez, in an interview, said she is also considering a handful of new bills for the next legislative session that would address various aspects of the gig economy, including insurance considerations.\n\nSeattle University law professor Charlotte Garden, who has studied gig-economy labor, said the California measure could be copied in other states, increasing potential costs to Uber. She said that may require Uber to find new ways to describe its business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of Uber\u2019s playbook to use colorful language to obscure the true nature of their business,\u201d Garden said.\n\nIn the Harris case, Uber\u2019s Valentino was asked whether he knew how many drivers Uber had in the state of Georgia. \u201cZero would be how many Uber drivers, because that\u2019s not what they are,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, if you are asking about independent third-party transportation providers \u2014 not trying to be difficult \u2014 I would say, no, I don\u2019t know the answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it true that Uber drivers like Mr. Ferguson are commanded to transport the Uber customer directly to their specified destination?\u201d asked Wheeles, the attorney, with the firm Morris Haynes in Birmingham, Ala.", "description": "Uber raised eyebrows last month when its chief lawyer asserted that \u201cdrivers\u2019 work is outside the usual course of Uber\u2019s business\u201d in a call laying out the company\u2019s resistance to a California bill that would alter the employment status of many gig workers.", "authors": ["Greg Bensinger", "Reporter Covering Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/EffoxO0hcIRuZ5lfaSVeSmazOxE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/27XAXIHAVAI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
