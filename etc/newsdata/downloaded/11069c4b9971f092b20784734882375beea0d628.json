The study found Oregon has about 350 homeless people per 100,000 people, nearly double the national average of 168 per 100,000. The study also found that Oregon's homeless rate has increased by nearly 14.10 percent since 2014.\n\nOn any given night, thousands of people can be found sleeping on the streets of Portland. The latest count, released in August, shows that, in 2019, more people were sleeping outside in Multnomah County than at any time in the last decade. Of the 2,037 unsheltered people, nearly 80 percent reported having one or more disabilities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cWe have to figure out that homelessness is just an umbrella term where it\u2019s not just homelessness,\" Kirby said. \"It\u2019s the mental illness and also the drug abuse of downtown Portland.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Travis Fedschun contributed to this report.", "description": "Oregon\u2019s homeless issue is not being fully addressed, according to a downtown Portland business owner.
