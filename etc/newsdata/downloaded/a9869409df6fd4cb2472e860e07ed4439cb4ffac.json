Each member of the Yankees\u2019 lineup besides Gary Sanchez, who was hit by a pitch, and Giancarlo Stanton, who plated a run on a sacrifice fly, recorded a hit by the third inning.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nGregorius, Edwin Encarnacion, Gio Urshela and Aaron Judge each had multiple hits for New York. Encarnacion drove in the Yankees\u2019 first run in the opening inning after DJ LeMahieu\u2019s lead-off double against rookie starter Randy Dobnak. Gleyber Torres and Brett Gardner both had RBI singles in the third inning.\n\nDobnak earned his spot on the Twins staff with a 1.59 ERA in his first 28.1 major league innings. But he failed to record an out in the third inning Saturday and exited with the bases loaded. He was eventually charged with four runs on six hits and a pair of walks. Tyler Duffey got two outs in that third inning but also allowed a pair of hits, including the Gregorius slam.\n\nDuring the regular season, opponents were 4-for-54 off Duffey after falling behind 0-2.\n\n\n\nTonight, Duffey gives up a single, hits a batter and gives up a grand slam after getting ahead 0-2. \u2014 LaVelle E. Neal III (@LaVelleNeal) October 5, 2019\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough one offense is very much deciding this series, the Yankees got excellent performances out of Masahiro Tanaka and their bullpen. Tommy Kahnle, Adam Ottavino, Tyler Lyons contributed three scoreless innings in relief.\n\nMinnesota got a run on a Mitch Garver single in the fourth during their only real threat before garbage time. Garver\u2019s base knock put two on with one out, but Tanaka was able to squirm out of the jam with back-to-back strikeouts of Luis Arraez and Miguel Sano.\n\nArraez later added a run on a two-out RBI double off Jonathan Loaisiga in the ninth.\n\nSo far, New York\u2019s offense has answered the call, already outscoring Minnesota 18-5 in the first two games. The Twins have lost 15 consecutive postseason games and are running out of time in what\u2019s already a lopsided series.\n\nDidi Gregorius watches his third-inning grand slam leave the yard at Yankee Stadium.

He surrendered a run on three hits and a walk with seven strikeouts over five innings. Tanaka has a 1.54 ERA with 32 strikeouts and eight walks in six October starts.\n\nEdwin Encarnacion: An offensive hero in Game 1, Encarnacion stayed hot Saturday night. He singled home the Yankees\u2019 first run in the opening inning and added another base hit in the rally leading up to the Gregorius slam. Credit should also go to Aaron Judge, who had two hits and reached base four times \u2014 both hits came in the same inning, which is a first for a Yankee in the club\u2019s 399th postseason game.\n\nDevin Smeltzer: Things were already out of hand for Minnesota, but Smeltzer prevented them from getting much worse. He allowed an inherited runner to score on consecutive singles to begin his outing, but kept the Yankees at bay soon after. The rookie Smeltzer walked three and struck out four over 3.1 innings in his first postseason appearance. Cody Stashak, Trevor May, Sergio Romo and Zack Littell each had scoreless outings for Minnesota.\n\nMUST SEE MOMENT\n\nGregorius\u2019 grand slam put an exclamation point on the seven-run third inning. Yankee Stadium erupted, and the lead seemed insurmountable for the Twins. Also, Gregorius either knew it was gone off the bat or thought he yanked it foul, the reaction was indistinguishable.\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nFolks began eulogizing the Twins\u2019 season after Gregorius\u2019 grand slam. Should we expect more of the same as the series shifts to Minnesota? The Yankees are 11-1 in their past 12 postseason games against the Twins.\n\nRocco Baldelli saved Odorizzi, a fly ball pitcher, for Game 3 at Target Field and opted to go with the grounder inducing Dobnak in Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. Should Baldelli have put his best foot forward and started Odorizzi in New York to avoid falling behind, 0-2?\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nThe Yankees will look to end the series in Minnesota with a win in Game 3 on Monday at 8:40 p.m. ET. Luis Severino (1-1, 1.50 ERA) starts for the Yankees in his fourth major league appearance of 2019. Odorizzi (15-7, 3.51 ERA) will try to keep the season alive for Minnesota.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The New York Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, 8-2, in Game 2 of the American League Division Series on Saturday night at Yankee Stadium.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/X9c1P.dxSIqFeBA1EaMu3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MyQWrzqTXcg461ChZSylJg--~B/aD0xODUyO3c9Mjc3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/f1b63ed0-e7cf-11e9-9bae-3073cc5a2804", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
