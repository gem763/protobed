REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nThe Democrats used some of their harshest language yet against Trump in their first matchup since the launch of a congressional impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate leading rival Joe Biden.\n\nThe unity gave way to some sharp clashes later in the debate over healthcare and a wealth tax. And Democrats found a new target: U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has surged into a virtual tie with Biden in many Democratic opinion polls.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\nCALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT\n\nFormer Vice President Biden joined Senator Bernie Sanders in calling Trump \u201cthe most corrupt president in modern history.\u201d\n\nWarren said she called for Trump\u2019s impeachment after Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s findings on Russia election interference.\n\nCongress did not move to impeach, she said, \u201cand look what happened: Donald Trump broke the law again.\u201d\n\nBillionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, who has poured millions into an impeach-Trump fund since 2017, tipped his hat to his rivals in his first debate.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate here is more decent and coherent and patriotic than that criminal in the White House,\u201d said Steyer, the last candidate to jump into the race.\n\nA WARREN PILE-ON\n\nWarren\u2019s reward for closing in on Biden? She became the punching bag.\n\nPete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, turned on the senator from Massachusetts after she answered a question about whether taxes would go up under the Medicare for All government healthcare plan by saying \u201ccosts\u201d would go up.\n\nThat was \u201ca yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nSanders chided Warren for not being clear on whether Medicare for All plans would raise taxes, falling back on his favourite line about having written the \u201cdamn bill.\u201d He said a majority of people will save money on their healthcare costs, but \u201cI do think it\u2019s appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up.\u201d\n\nAmy Klobuchar, a senator from Minnesota, piled on, telling Warren, \u201cYou are making Republican talking points\u201d by proposing a plan that would eliminate private insurance. She added, \u201cThe difference between a plan and a pipedream is something that you can get done.\u201d\n\nAs if on cue, the Trump campaign promptly put out a news release criticizing Warren\u2019s answer. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign followed suit.\n\nTO TAX OR NOT TO TAX\n\nBusinessman Andrew Yang said taxing wealth, as opposed to income, is bad policy, attacking a position supported by several Democrats, including Warren and Sanders.\n\n\u201cWe should not be looking to other countries\u2019 mistakes,\u201d said Yang. \u201cInstead we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden still have which is a value-added tax and we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it.\u201d\n\nWarren explained her plan, which she said will give young Americans better economic opportunities - taxing 2% of people\u2019s net worth above $50 million and 3% over $1 billion.\n\n\u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s why ... does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation?\u201d\n\nGUN CONTROL\n\nIn an exchange on gun control, Buttigieg and former U.S. Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas renewed a long-running rivalry.\n\nThe two have a history of disagreement on the subject. Buttigieg does not support O\u2019Rourke\u2019s proposal to force people to sell some of their assault weapons and handguns to the government.\n\nDuring the debate, O\u2019Rourke described gun violence as a crisis and said politicians should take their lead from activists who are pushing for mandatory gun buybacks.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s follow their inspiration and lead - and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told Buttigieg.\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the polls; the problem is the policy,\u201d Buttigieg shot back. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.\u201d\n\nVETERANS BATTLE\n\nMilitary veterans Buttigieg and U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard tussled over Trump\u2019s abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of northern Syria, which opened the door for Turkey to cross the border and attack the Kurds, a longtime U.S. ally.\n\nGabbard, an Iraq war veteran and major in the U.S. National Guard, said the assault on the Kurds was part of a long-failed U.S. policy of seeking \u201cregime change\u201d in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media,\u201d she said.\n\nButtigieg, who served in Afghanistan as part of the Naval Reserves, challenged Gabbard, saying she\u2019s pointing the finger in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cThe slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,\u201d Buttigieg said.", "description": "The 12 Democrats meeting in the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday night found a unifying message right off the bat: Republican Donald Trump is a corrupt president and must be impeached.", "authors": ["Trevor Hunnicutt", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441337778&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F068", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
