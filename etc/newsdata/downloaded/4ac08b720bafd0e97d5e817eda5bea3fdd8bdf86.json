More like blowpens as playoff relievers get rocked", "language": "en", "text": "Kyle Gibson kept hoping he\u2019d someday pitch in October, take the mound in a big game when the whole sport was watching. Last week, he got that chance.\n\nSummoned late at Yankee Stadium, the 31-year-old Minnesota right-hander entered the AL Division Series opener. The result - one inning, three runs on three walks, a hit and three stolen bases.\n\n\u201cFirst postseason opportunity, didn\u2019t go how I thought it was going to go,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone.\n\nNational League closers Carlos Martinez, Mark Melancon and Sean Doolittle were tagged. All-Star setup man Ryan Pressly struggled, $140 million starter Patrick Corbin was shelled in a different role.\n\nBullpens? More like blowpens as playoff relievers across the majors got rocked.\n\nTheir totals so far in the ALDS and NLDS: 100 innings, 65 earned runs and a 5.85 ERA.\n\nThe most effective reliever this month? Max Scherzer, the three-time Cy Young Award winner who struck out all three batters he faced at Dodger Stadium.\n\nAnd remember, Scherzer and the Washington Nationals made it this far only after rallying late against Milwaukee closer Josh Hader in the NL wild-card game.\n\nNot exactly what fans were expecting, seeing how relievers for the eight teams that made this round combined for a 4.12 ERA in the regular season.\n\nThen again, it\u2019s not the regular season.\n\n\u201cWhen you pitch in the postseason, you\u2019re kind of fighting - you\u2019re fighting emotions, you\u2019re fighting, like, you\u2019re pretty energetic physically, a lot of times,\u201d successful Tampa Bay starter Charlie Morton said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously October, it\u2019s the end of the regular season. You\u2019re kind of in a spot where you really haven\u2019t been all year.\u201d\n\nAroldis Chapman and the New York Yankees were about the only relief corps to escape unscathed, allowing three earned runs in 13 1/3 innings. Chapman threw a called third strike past Twins slugger Nelson Cruz to finish off a 5-1 win Monday night for a three-game sweep.\n\n\u201cI think the really important part of it has been that we\u2019ve been healthy,\u201d Chapman said through a translator.\n\nThe Dodgers watched their \u2018pen give up five runs in 5 1/3 innings Monday during a 6-1 loss at Washington. That sent their series back to LA for a deciding Game 5, with Walker Buehler set to start Wednesday - and longtime lefty ace Clayton Kershaw ready to relieve.\n\n\u201cObviously this game Clayton was available and it was more of a situation - seventh, eighth, sixth, seventh, eighth, potentially ninth inning tied or with the lead,\u201d Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \u201cObviously the game got away from us.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo now to preserve him and to have him ready to go, whatever we need from him, for Game 5, is certainly a good thing to be piggybacked at some point with Walker. That\u2019s kind of the thought,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Cardinals and Braves will play Game 5 in Atlanta on Wednesday. Martinez has already had two appearances this series in which he allowed three runs; he had only one all season for St. Louis. Melancon, who became the Braves\u2019 closer after he was acquired from San Francisco at the July 31 trade deadline, gave up four runs in a Game 1 loss.\n\nScherzer, meanwhile, pitched seven innings to help Doolittle and the Nationals tie the Dodgers at two games each. That came after Scherzer\u2019s one-inning stint Friday, on top of his start in the wild-card game last Tuesday.\n\nAny chance we\u2019ll see him in Game 5?\n\n\u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, I mean, my arm is hanging right now. That was, that, that pushed me all the way to the edge and then some. So, yeah, I can\u2019t imagine any scenario where I\u2019m pitching.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kyle Gibson kept hoping he'd someday pitch in October, take the mound in a big game when the whole sport was watching.
