Students and their doctors believe that they should be able to use medical marijuana on campus. Universities, however, want to uphold their drug policies.\n\nSheida Assar, a student at GateWay Community College in Phoenix, Arizona, claims that she was expelled after testing positive for marijuana that she had been prescribed. Assar, who was prescribed marijuana to help with sleeping, claims that she has never been under the influence of the drug on campus.\n\n\u201cThey yanked me out of class in the middle of the school day,\u201d Assar said in a short comment. \u201cThey escorted me to the administration like I was a \u2026 criminal. It\u2019s discrimination, and it also violates my rights under the Arizona medical marijuana law.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the school claims that they are in the process of reviewing their policies on marijuana in light of the new medical laws. However, the spokesperson said that they have no plans to change their drug policy. This doesn\u2019t help Assar. Assar is now forced to sue the college to recover the costs of her tuition.\n\nOne Connecticut student was kicked out of required courses after it was revealed that she had tested positive for marijuana. She had been prescribed marijuana to treat undisclosed illnesses.\n\nThe student\u2019s attorney, Michael That Allen, claims that universities are not equipped to handle the new laws that are designed to offer patients new avenues of care.\n\n\u201cMany schools disability services offices are not universally listened to by the university,\u201d Allen said. \u201cIt just shows that these kinds of issues will become more common if employers and schools don\u2019t abide by the law.\u201d", "description": "American colleges and universities around the country are facing lawsuits from students seeking to use medical marijuana on campus.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/wi/ap/04/8e7edd_medical-marijuana-utah-34876-emily-savage-in-21-2018-file-photo-laboratory-e1572372200998-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
