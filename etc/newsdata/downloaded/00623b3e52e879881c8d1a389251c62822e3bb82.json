From presidents to police, from military generals to court clerks, from most teachers to many transportation officials \u2014 the common denominator among all is they\u2019re employed by taxpayers, paid by taxpayers, accountable to taxpayers in word and deed.\n\nSupposedly, anyway.\n\nSo when someone like Kellyanne Conway, adviser to the most powerful person in the country, perhaps in the world, President Donald Trump, is captured on audio passively-aggressively berating a journalist and demanding explanation for coverage \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re gonna have to give me a journalistic reason\u201d \u2014 it seems opportune to remind: In America, the public servant class works for the private citizenry.\n\nIt\u2019s not the other way around.\n\nThere are far too many politicians and public servants who have been forgetting their proper station in American life in recent times.\n\nAnd this is becoming one of the biggest headaches for those who value freedom, in the way the framers intended freedom to be in this country.\n\nOnce again, for those in the back of the room: America is a country founded on the basic principle that our individual rights come from God. They\u2019re not bestowed by government. They\u2019re not disbursed here, but not there, to this one, but not that one. They\u2019re. From. God.\n\nAnd that means government has no right to strip them away.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, that means government has no right to pretend a position of power or authority over the people that the people don\u2019t explicitly give.\n\nThe government works for the people.\n\nSo when Rep. Adam Schiff wants to hold meetings about impeachment behind closed doors \u2014 it\u2019s wrong.\n\nWhen law enforcement authorities want to go to secret courts to obtain secret wire tapping abilities on American citizens, for reasons that are then kept secret \u2014 it\u2019s wrong.\n\nWhen members of Congress want to pass laws that exempt themselves from the very socialist health care system they force the American people to accept \u2014 it\u2019s wrong.\n\nWhen teachers in public schools overstretch their bounds by telling parents what should be in their children\u2019s lunches, or by threatening parents for failing to sign forms that are voluntary, or by pretending as if parents need certain excuses to dismiss their children early from school \u2014 all the while using union power to go on strike and demand more, more, more in pay and benefits \u2014 it\u2019s wrong.\n\nWhen police intimidate citizens to stop recording activities on a public sidewalk; when the Internal Revenue Service holds up applications for non-profits for puzzling, even nefarious reasons; when White House administrations bypass Congress to issue unconstitutional executive orders on immigration and climate change; when state governments overtax and rather than refund, keep the money for a so-called rainy day; when county clerks at local court houses refuse to answer simple questions; when Department of Motor Vehicle employees treat customers as second-class annoyances; when local zoning and planning commissioners arrogantly deny permits that shouldn\u2019t be denied and affix fees for private property activities that shouldn\u2019t be affixed fees \u2014 it\u2019s all wrong.\n\nAnd when individuals paid by tax dollars and entrusted with high positions of power use those positions to belittle and demean and mock and even intimidate the bosses who employ them \u2014 it\u2019s not just wrong. It\u2019s time for the employers to remind everyone who\u2019s the employer and who\u2019s the employee. How so?\n\nHere\u2019s anidea: File a Freedom of Information Act request for local government officials\u2019 salaries \u2014 and post them online. Others? File Sunshine Law requests for school superintendent and administrators\u2019 contracts \u2014 and post them online. File FOIA requests for state representatives\u2019 daily email correspondences \u2014 and post them online.\n\nOr, tape record, in compliance with the law, telephone conversations with leading political figures who call to harass or intimidate \u2014 and post them online.\n\nIt\u2019s all good. Whatever works. Whatever serves up the necessary slice of humble pie.\n\nRemember: It\u2019s not about Republican versus Democrat. It\u2019s about individual rights; individual freedoms. It\u2019s about the God-given, not the government granted.\n\nAnd it\u2019s only when government fears the people that there is true liberty.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
