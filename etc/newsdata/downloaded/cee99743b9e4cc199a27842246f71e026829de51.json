The company also removed BackupHK, a separate app that served as mirror of the main HKlive.map app. Hong Kong police had no immediate comment.", "description": "The tech giant had come under fire from China over the app, with the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper calling it 'poisonous'.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7927%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_241%2C$y_49/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/4c799964f56116c8cf9491602e7f5369045f20c3", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
