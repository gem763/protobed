Mr. Osterholm also noted CWD prions are found in the muscles of the lymphatic system, so cooking the meat does not eliminate the risk. Prion strains also change as they pass through animals, he noted, commenting on a concern that they could mutate to the point they could affect humans.\n\nThe CDC says that while there is no strong evidence for human transmission, some research suggests that the CWD prion can infect squirrel monkeys as well as laboratory mice that carry human genes.\n\n\u201cIt is not known if people can get infected with CWD prions. Nevertheless, these experimental studies raise the concern that CWD may pose a risk to people and suggest that it is important to prevent human exposures to CWD,\u201d the CDC reported.\n\nAn estimated 7,000 to 15,000 animals infected with CWD are consumed by hunter families each year, according to the Alliance for Public Wildlife. This number continues to rise up to 20% every year, the organization asserts.\n\nStates also have different regulations and precautions to contain CWD. Lawmakers in Nevada this year banned the importation of certain animal body parts that contain large amounts of prions, including the brain and spinal cord, into the state, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Wyoming Game and Fish Department is urging hunters and the public to report deer, elk or moose that appear to be sick or behaving abnormally to contact local wildlife authorities.\n\nThe department confirmed last week chronic wasting disease in a deer for the first time in a hunting area about 12 miles west of Bondurant. The hunting area is closer to wintering elk feedgrounds, causing concern that the disease could spread to elk populations.\n\nAnimals infected with CWD could exhibit signs of drastic weight loss, drooping ears, lack of fear of people, stumbling, excessive thirst or urination, drooling and listlessness.\n\nChronic wasting disease was first discovered in captive deer in the late 1960s at a Colorado research facility and in wild deer in 1981.\n\nThe disease spread to surrounding areas in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming by the 1990s and has been found in an increasing number of states, including across the mid-Atlantic since 2000.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
