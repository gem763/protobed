Mr Broccoli, the bizarre Animal Rebellion activist who dressed as a vegetable in London and for a television interview with Piers Morgan, has been unmasked as a carpenter from Bristol. Married Roland Everson, 46, a business owner, is a member of Animal Rebellion - a vegan offshoot of the Extinction Rebellion movement that has brought chaos to London and cities around the world with their 'Autumn Uprising' this month. Mr Everson also uses the equally strange moniker 'Lunchy Munchy' and is a senior member of the 'Friendsnotfood' group in the West Country.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, more than \u00a3500,000 has been donated to support the protest, and cross-party politicians are calling on people to get involved.\n\nMore than 170 coaches from around Britain were due to arrive in London today taking people to the march.\n\nClaiming to be the only way to 'save the country', the People's Vote campaign claims that the 'only way to break the deadlock in Parliament, legitimise the outcome and allow us all to talk about something else, is to give the people the final say'.\n\nMr Khan wrote in The Independent on Friday: 'I'll be joining hundreds of thousands of people in London to make sure our message is heard loud and clear over the jeers and sneers in the House of Commons.'\n\nLiberal Democrat MP Luciana Berger also told voters to 'let the Prime Minister know what you think'.\n\nPeople's Vote organisers are also asking people to sign a letter to Boris Johnson, EU leaders, MPs, and MEPs, asking them to allow 'the chance to check whether we want to proceed with Brexit'.\n\nIn an email to supporters this morning, Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the letter 'asks them to honour our shared democratic values, it asks them not to turn away from us now and deny us the chance for a final say.\n\n'Add your name to the letter now and send a message to the powerful.'\n\nJames McGrory, director of the People's Vote campaign said ahead of the protest that the government should heed the anger of pro-Europeans and hold another referendum on EU membership.\n\nHe said: 'This new deal bears no resemblance to what people were promised and so it is only right that the public deserve another chance to have their say.'\n\nCampaigners are confident that the number of people on the streets will rival a similar demonstration in March, when organisers said one million people took to the streets. A rally this size would be among the largest ever in Britain.\n\nRemain activists draped in EU flags gather at Park Lane ahead of the march on Parliament to persuade MPs to thwart Mr Johnson's deal\n\nScottish Pro remain protesters gather in Hyde Park to march to Parliament to demand for a People's Vote and a final say\n\nBanner-waving EU campaigners appeared in buoyant spirits as they flocked onto the streets for the People's Vote march\n\nBrexiteers were also out in force for a counter-protest, but their numbers were dwarfed by the thousands expected to turn out for the People's Vote march\n\nPro-EU campaigners waved placards demanding a second referendum is put before the British people ahead of Brexit\n\nA GUIDE TO SUPER SATURDAY Mr Johnson will formally present his divorce accord to the Commons and ask MPs to vote for it. The House of Commons usually sits from Monday to Thursday, and on the occasional Friday. But today there will be an extraordinary sitting of Parliament - the first on a weekend since April 1982 - to discuss Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal. On Thursday, MPs approved a motion to hold the first weekend sitting of Parliament since the Falklands conflict. The day will start with the PM setting out the terms of the agreement in a statement to the House which is due to begin shortly after 9.30am. Following a lengthy debate MPs will then vote on the deal - and any amendments which are selected by Commons Speaker John Bercow - at approximately 2.30pm. If Parliament does not vote for the agreement on Saturday, Mr Johnson faces an almighty clash over whether he will request a further Brexit delay from Brussels as he is compelled to under the Benn Act.\n\nStop Brexit campaigner Steve Bray was preparing for the second referendum march as MPs arrived for the Saturday sitting in the House of Commons.\n\nThe 50-year-old from Port Talbot, South Wales, has been protesting outside Parliament every day that it has been sitting for the past 25 months.\n\nA pro-Brexit protester with a loud speaker approached later approached him shouting 'Traitor!' But Mr Bray said protesting against Brexit is his passion.\n\nHe said: 'We scraped the bottom of the barrel with this Prime Minister.' Meanwhile, Brexit supporters are due to take to the streets in Manchester on Saturday.\n\nThe 'march for democracy'' will take place near Manchester Cathedral, organised by Leavers of Greater Manchester.\n\nIn London, Hannah Barton, 56, a cider maker from central England, who was draped in an EU flag said: 'I am incensed that we are not being listened to.\n\n'Nearly all the polls show that now people want to remain in the EU. We feel that we are voiceless.'\n\nIn one side street near Parliament, a group of demonstrators with bells strapped to their legs and wielding sticks performed a traditional English morris dance and chanted: 'Morris, not Boris!' to cheers from onlookers.\n\nOne of the dancers, Kate Fisher, says 'demos that are fun and joyful are more effective.'\n\nSarah Spoor, who cares for her two children with disabilities, choked back tears as she said she is 'distraught' at the prospect of Britain leaving the EU.\n\nPro-Brexit protesters outside the Houses of Parliament in London after Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a statement in the House of Commons on his new Brexit deal\n\nProtestors take part in an anti-Brexit, Let Us Be Heard march on Old Park Lane as they head to Parliament Square in London", "description": "Supporters of the so-called People's Vote campaign group gathered at Park Lane (left) before marching on the Palace of Westminster for a mass rally.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/12/19920074-0-image-a-66_1571483857043.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
