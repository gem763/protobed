My whole family enjoyed the shenanigans of Frankie, her husband Mike, and their kids Axl, Sue, and Brick.\n\nYes, the Barones and the Hecks were exaggerated and over the top, which made for great laughs, but these TV families were also, when things got serious, loving, accepting of and faithful to each other, which kept us invested.\n\nIn real life, Heaton has the courage to witness to her own priorities of faith and family, as she did recently on Stephen Colbert \u2014 a rarity in the entertainment world, where it is so much safer to keep quiet.\n\nSo I was looking forward to the premiere (September 26) of her new show, \"Carol\u2019s Second Act,\" where Heaton is the lead as well as an executive producer. I had high hopes, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\n\"Carol\u2019s Second Act\" is about Carol Kenney, a 50-year-old divorced mother of grown children who had been a high school science teacher, but is embarking on as second career as a doctor. She arrives on her first day as an intern and meets her three young fellow interns, and her chief resident \u2014 and the fun begins.\n\nThe laughs come as Carol\u2019s beaming enthusiasm for getting her second chance contrasts with the young interns\u2019 angst and competition, and when, for example, Carol makes a boomer reference that leaves the Millennials clueless. (\u201cI\u2019m a regular Angela Lansbury,\u201d she says to intern Daniel [Jean-Luc Bilodeau] who retorts: \u201cStop talking about your friends.\u201d)\n\nThere is a substantial message at the heart of the series, and that is that people over 50 can reinvent themselves and have a lot to offer (ahem, yes I can relate to this too). Yes, Carol is much older than her fellow newbies, in their scrubbed fervor and anxiety. They have the intensity and energy of the young; but anyone who has spent time in hospitals can recall times when interns, especially on rounds, lack sensitivity and the basics of bedside manner. Or, in trying to appear confident and decisive, make mistakes. In this first episode, while the young ones are good at following procedures, it is Carol\u2019s empathetic listening to a patient\u2019s wife that gives her clues about the eventual diagnosis her cohorts have missed.\n\nThe new sitcom makes a good point, says Jalal Baig on NBCNews.com: Carol Kenney \u201crepresents a real and growing demographic in medicine. While the average age of those entering medical school has remained 24, the number of students beginning the grueling process at 26 or older is now approximately 17 percent \u2026 and with this spectrum of ages comes an even greater spectrum of backgrounds: designers, teachers, lawyers, musicians, firefighters, etc.\u201d And \u201colder medical students with disparate pasts often have strong emotional resilience and a greater sensitivity toward patients.\u201d\n\nThis point is made in Carol\u2019s exasperated speech when she is expecting another in a series of dress-downs from the chief resident, Dr. Maya Jacobs (Ito Aghayere):\n\n\"You think a woman my age should just disappear into the woods and knit.\n\nBut I see the world in a different way than when I was 28.\n\nI know that life doesn't work out the way you want it to.\n\nI know that at least one of your kids is going to be a disappointment.\n\nI know all kinds of stuff that you won't know for another 20 years.\n\nAnd guess what, my age is what's going to make me a great doctor.\"\n\nSo there! As it turns out, Carol has some important wins on the first day of her second act. I\u2019m looking forward to following her adventures.\n\nMaria McFadden Maffucci is the editor of the Human Life Review, www.humanlifereview.com, a quarterly journal devoted to the defense of human life, founded in 1974 by her father, James P.
