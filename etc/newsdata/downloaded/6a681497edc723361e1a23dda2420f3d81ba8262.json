Once that is finished and we know where we stand, when there is no more avenue for Fortescue to appeal on this matter, then we'll submit our application for compensation,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Woodley has accused Fortescue of causing heartache in his community, including division in his own family, by backing a breakaway group known as Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation (WMYAC) during the dispute.\n\nMr Woodley's brother, WMYAC member Davin Woodley, is now behind a request signed by more than 50 others for a general meeting of the WMYAC, which was awarded two Fortescue contracts worth $179 million in June.\n\nThe disgruntled WMYAC members are calling for fresh board elections and a forensic accounting report on all business dealings since 2010.\n\nMMYAC did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMs Gaines said Fortescue was considering its next move in the wake of losing the Federal Court appeal and remained open to concluding an Indigenous Land Use Agreement with the \"whole of the Yindjibarndi community\".\n\n\"Fortescue has never challenged the Yindjibarndi People\u2019s right to native title, nor was this case ever about compensation,\" she said.\n\n\"Our mining tenure rights and current operations are also unaffected, and our legal advice is consistent with our previous view that there is no material financial impact to Fortescue following the Federal Court\u2019s decision.\"\n\nMs Gaines also strongly defended Fortescue's record in negotiating with traditional owners and creating jobs and business opportunities for Aboriginal people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFortescue has seven Land Access Agreements in place with traditional owners which it says that in addition to royalties have delivered training and assistance to more than 1600 people and $2.3 billion in contracts to Aboriginal businesses.", "description": "Fortescue Metals Group has hit out at the Federal Court over native title rulings it claims pose a threat to investment in regional Australia.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2715%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_379%2C$y_77/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/331cf3995c3bba87bcc8c62f40f637a176d8a6ec", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
