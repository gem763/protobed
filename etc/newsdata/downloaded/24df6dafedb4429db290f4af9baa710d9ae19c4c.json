It\u2019s about running a zoo. In order to do that, you have to build enclosures, outfit habitats with the proper flora for the species \u2014 species from the African grasslands don\u2019t want tropical plants in their habitats, for example \u2014 and make sure that each animal in your park is properly stimulated with toys and enrichment items. It\u2019s all done incredibly well.\n\nI have small exhibits of warthogs, ostriches, peafowl and African wild dogs, and I\u2019m trying to keep them happy and entertained. It\u2019s harder than it looks. The peafowl and peahens that I bought for my first habitat weren\u2019t quite happy until I got them a slow feeder, which kept them from getting bored, thus boring my guests. But even bored, the animals are cute.\n\nI spend long stretches of time trying to find the optimal angle to take pictures of them. There is clearly so much love and care taken to portray these animals and their behaviours. When I add a small pond to the warthog enclosure, they immediately begin to swim in and through it, to drink from it. When the sun sets in my Zoo, the amber light glistens on their skin. I am devoted to keeping these warthogs happy, by hook or by crook.\n\nIn Planet Zoo\u2019s complex system of resource management, there\u2019s always something to check on. To be able to buy toys and enrichment items for certain animals, you have to assign a veterinarian to study them. While that\u2019s ongoing, you can add services for your park\u2019s guests, though you have to meticulously create staff-only paths throughout the zoo because guests hate seeing behind the scenes.\n\nWhile you\u2019re building, you might as well check on the integrity of your habitats\u2019 walls, as they degrade over time. You don\u2019t want one of your african wild dogs to escape, as one of mine had. My keepers caught it quickly, but the alert I got about a dangerous animal escaping gave me a fright.\n\nOn top of all that, every few months an inspector will come around, and part of the criteria on which your park is judged is education value. If you don\u2019t have signs and audio recordings throughout the park to help teach your guests about the animals, you\u2019ll have a hard time scoring points with your inspector. Education value helps keep your park open, and brings in new guests. New guests means more money, which you can use to keep sprucing up your park.\n\nI haven\u2019t quite gotten a handle on all the ins and outs of running a zoo properly, mostly because I just want to adopt more animals. Watching my African wild dogs play with each other or lazily doze in the afternoon sun makes me yearn to be able to reach out and touch them. In particular, furry animals feel incredibly tactile, each one of them pettable, huggable, touchable. It makes me wish I had my own dog that I could hug to my chest as I play.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that Planet Zoo is my shit. I love simulation games with my entire heart. The obvious care taken to portray these animals accurately set this game apart. Like the tiny, digital visitors in my park, I just keep watching these animals with a sense of wonder.", "description": "Planet Zoo, a new PC game from Frontier, the makers of Planet Coaster, is currently in a beta available to players that pre-ordered the deluxe version of the game.
