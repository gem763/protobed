(Brynn Anderson/AP)\n\nThe Campaign\n\nTHREADING THE NEEDLE: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez doubled down on the committee's decision not to directly counter Republican attacks on former vice president Joe Biden, arguing that its role is not to be any individual candidate's defender.\n\nKey: \u201cThe DNC in 2020 is running a campaign process to make sure that every single person has an opportunity to demonstrate that they are most qualified to be president, and I don\u2019t believe it would be our role to be airing ads every time there is misinformation,\u201d Perez told C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers.\u201d That role, Perez said, is \u201cup to the campaign.\"\n\n\u201cThe DNC in 2020 is running a campaign process to make sure that every single person has an opportunity to demonstrate that they are most qualified to be president, and I don\u2019t believe it would be our role to be airing ads every time there is misinformation,\u201d Perez told C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers.\u201d That role, Perez said, is \u201cup to the campaign.\" As the Trump campaign runs ads that promulgate unsubstantiated accusations about Biden and his son's dealings in Ukraine, Perez said: \u201cWhat we are doing forcefully \u2014 and will continue to do forcefully \u2014 is to call out misinformation and make sure networks aren\u2019t aiding and abetting in the dissemination of misinformation. I think that's a critically important role.\u201d\n\nPerez is in a tricky spot: He's under pressure to uphold the national party committee's neutrality as a historic number of Democrats run for the high office \u2014 an especially sensitive task in after leaked emails from top DNC officials suggested the committee sought to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) during the 2016 presidential primary.\n\nAt the same time, the DNC chair has been pressed to take a stand as Trump\u2019s push to foreign leaders to investigate Biden sparked an impeachment inquiry in the House \u2014 and spawned a crop of misleading counterattacks, in particular an ad currently running on social media and broadcast networks that the Biden campaign claims \u201cspreads false, definitively debunked conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nIntraparty tensions between Biden's camp and committee staffers were first reported last week by the New York Times: \u201cThe strain grew so acute that some of Mr. Biden\u2019s advisers lashed out at their own party, taking the unusual step of urging campaign surrogates to criticize the [DNC] for not doing more to defend Mr. Biden,\u201d Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns and Katie Glueck reported.\n\nA compromise: The DNC has called for Facebook and networks to refuse to carry the 30-second ad called \u201cBiden Corruption,\" which alleges without evidence that Biden promised Ukraine $1 billion to fire a prosecutor looking a Ukraine gas company to protect his son Hunter Biden and accuses \u201cmedia lap dogs\u201d of helping Democrats with their impeachment push.\n\nSo far, just CNN has said the ad does not meet its standards and NBC is reportedly demanding changes.\n\nFacebook declined to remove it, and broadly exempts politicians' speech or ads from third-party fact-checkers: \u201cWe don\u2019t believe that it's an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician's speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny,\u201d Facebook vice president Nick Clegg wrote in a recent blog post.\n\nPerez, however, insisted that the narrative Trump and his allies are pushing will not hurt Biden going into 2020. \u201cI think people are smarter than this,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCASH BATTLE: Perez also claimed he's not concerned by the Republican National Committee's historically large war chest \u2014 which our colleagues Michelle Ye Hee Lee and Anu Narayanswamy reported has \u201cgiven [Trump] a head start over the eventual Democratic nominee.\"\n\nBy the numbers: \u201cTrump\u2019s overflowing coffers have allowed him to spend lavishly early in the race. For instance, the committees recently launched $10 million ad offense targeting Democrats, including [Biden].\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s overflowing coffers have allowed him to spend lavishly early in the race.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have done: \u201cWe have a resolution in place where we don't take money from entities who are inconsistent with our values and we will continue to abide by that.\"\n\n2016 ON THE BRAIN: Perez said that the committee is not \u201cbulletproof\u201d in terms of digital security as it seeks to protect its systems from repeat cyberattacks in 2020.\n\nHe blamed part of the difficulty on the president for effectively giving adversaries the green light to go ahead and hack U.S. entities by refusing to accept the findings of Republican-led congressional committees, intelligence agencies and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation that Moscow tried to help Trump win in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou have a president right now, sending his attorney general around the world to try to debunk what the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2014 on a bipartisan basis \u2014 just said, which is that the Russians tried to influence our election,\u201d said Perez.\n\nPerez said that his priority at the committee is building a \u201crobust infrastructure\u201d to prevent a hack with the helped of outside partners \u2014 but \u201c unfortunately one of them is not the federal government and that is tragic for our democracy.\"\n\n\u201cThey are compromised\u201d: Perez said that to invite over career staffers from the Department of Homeland Security to help secure DNC systems \u2014 \u201cwhen their boss is actively soliciting aide to undermine his perceived opponents\" \u2014 would be \u201ccommitting political malpractice \u2026 They are compromised.\u201d\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) -- and elicited boos after mentioning the Somali refugee community in the Minneapolis district more broadly.\n\n\u201cLeaders in Washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia,\u201d Trump said, at which point a sizable portion of the crowd booed, \u201cwithout considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow hell did that ever happen?\u201d Trump said of Omar, the first Somali-American elected to Congress, adding: \u201cCongresswoman Omar is an America-hating socialist.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump played Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d tonight at a campaign event in Minneapolis despite confirming a year ago that the campaign would not use Prince\u2019s music.
