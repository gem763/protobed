Yet there\u2019s a reason why the beloved series made its theatrical debut on Netflix and not the network where it first aired over a decade ago.\n\n\u2018Breaking Bad\u2019s\u2019 special relationship with Netflix began after its first three seasons, when the show was at a critical crossroads. At the time AMC reportedly told creator Vince Gilligan that the series could end prematurely due to a lack of viewership \u2014 despite its critical acclaim.\n\nEnter Netflix.\n\nFans praise 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' (Courtesy: @sapphiremoon01 / Twitter) More\n\nAfter streaming on the platform for one year, \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 saw its season 5 premiere viewership more than double from the season prior \u2014 with Variety reporting 5.9 million viewers tuned in to watch. The show garnered over 10 million viewers by the end of the series.\n\n\"We felt that it was a virtuous cycle where we were introducing the show to new fans, who were then going and experiencing new episodes on AMC,\u201d Netflix VP of original content Cindy Holland told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Netflix partnership became a full circle moment for Gilligan, who credits the platform with elevating \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 to the cultural phenomenon it is today.\n\nThe movie will also air on AMC in early 2020 \u2014 a nod to the network that picked up the series after FX had passed. It will also run in independent theaters across the country on October 11 to October 13.\n\nAnd although \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d was the first cable show to take advantage of the so-called Netflix boom \u2014 other, more recent series echo a similar tale.\n\nFan-favorite \u201cYou\u201d rebounded from a struggling series on Lifetime to one of the top Netflix shows in 2018. Meanwhile, the CW\u2019s \u201cRiverdale\u201d jumped in ratings for season 2, after placing its first season on the platform.\n\nNetflix earnings preview\n\n\u201cEl Camino\u201d comes ahead of the platform\u2019s quarterly earnings results on October 16. Netflix is expected to post earnings per share of $1.25 on revenue of 5.3 billion, according to analysts polled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors will closely watch the platform\u2019s subscriber growth number, especially after last quarter\u2019s disappointing results where the streaming giant saw a loss of 126,000 subscribers, sharply missing the 309,240 gain that was expected.\n\nNetflix has never missed subscriber guidance two quarters in a row, so the pressure is on for the platform to outperform as competitors like Apple TV Plus (AAPL) and Disney Plus (DIS) gear up for November launches.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead more:", "description": "\"El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie\" officially dropped on Netflix, before the network that originally aired the hit drama.", "authors": ["Alexandra Canal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rNe7iod2Mp2S8JKEKQwR4w--~B/aD0yMjI5O3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/7e8fbb50-ec6d-11e9-bde7-1b6e25212451", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
