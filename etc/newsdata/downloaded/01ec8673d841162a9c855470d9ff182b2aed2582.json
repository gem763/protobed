His administration already has frozen prices for gasoline and some basic food products to help Argentines hurting from economic stagnation and annual inflation running at about 55%, one of the world\u2019s highest rates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster for Macri,\u201d said Bruno Binetti, a political analyst in Buenos Aires. \u201cFor him to reinstate restrictions after lifting them in the first days of his administration I would say is a humiliation.\u201d\n\nThe Argentine peso strengthened on Monday to close at 57.99 to the dollar from 59.51 in the previous session on Friday, according to Tullett Prebon. The benchmark Merval stocks index closed up 6.45%.\n\nThe capital controls require the central bank to limit dollar sales, forcing companies and banks to have obtain authorization to purchase hard currency. The country\u2019s Exporters now have to repatriate all hard currency from sales abroad. Individuals seeking to buy dollars will have a limit of $10,000 a month. Bank transfers abroad by individuals will also face a monthly limit of $10,000. Dollar purchases by nonresidents will be restricted to $1,000 a month, and they won\u2019t be allowed to make bank transfers abroad.\n\nFinance Minister Hern\u00e1n Lacunza said the government wasn\u2019t happy about implementing \u201cunpleasant measures\u201d it once quickly discarded in hopes of building a modern and competitive economy open to global trade.\n\n\u201cArgentina seems to be in a circle where every so often we return to the same port,\u201d Mr. Lacunza said in a television interview late Sunday. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the port where we imagined we\u2019d be at this moment.\u201d\n\nMr. Lacunza, who was appointed finance minister two weeks ago following the latest bout of volatility, said Argentina wasn\u2019t facing a run on the currency. But he defended the controls as a necessary precaution to prevent an uncontrollable depreciation of the Argentine peso that would spark havoc in a nation that has lurched from one economic crisis to another.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t measures for a normal country,\u201d Mr. Lacunza said. \u201cThese are uncomfortable measures but necessary to avoid greater damage.\u201d\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, which approved a $57 billion bailout package for Argentina last year, said it was analyzing the details of the measures and would be in close contact with Argentine authorities. \u201cThe fund will continue to stand with Argentina during these challenging times,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nCapital Economics, a London-based consulting firm, said the measures were \u201canother worrying sign that history is repeating itself.\u201d\n\nIn the short term, Mr. Macri\u2019s measure could help stem capital flight and slow the depletion of reserves, Capital Economics, a London-based consulting firm said. But in the long term, Capital Economics said the controls would undermine business activity and fuel a black-market demand for dollars.\n\nThe central bank has increased the selling of dollars in an effort to reduce the sharp depreciation of the peso after Mr. Macri suffered defeat in an Aug. 11 primary vote. Economists say foreign-currency reserves have fallen by $12.2 billion since Aug. 9, some 20% of the total.\n\nMonday\u2019s capital-control measures were announced after the government last week unilaterally extended the maturity of all short-term paper after it was unable to roll over obligations as a result of plunging demand for government debt.\n\nThe latest turmoil was sparked by investor concerns about the return to power of the nationalist Peronist movement that is expected to ditch austerity policies Mr. Macri began to put in place in 2015 after winning power. Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, the Peronist candidate, is the heavy favorite to win the Oct. 27 election.\n\nWhile political analysts say Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez is a pragmatic moderate, many Argentines believe his running mate, the fiery former leftist President Cristina Kirchner, will have a big role in the next government. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez said his government would increase wages and government pensions and try to contain inflation via a broad-ranging pact with employers.\n\n\u201cTo reverse this cycle you must launch a plan to boost consumption,\u201d he said in the interview, in which he partly blamed the IMF bailout for the market slide.\n\nMrs. Kirchner, a deeply polarizing figure who is facing several corruption trials, has kept a low profile during the campaign since surprising Argentines in May by announcing that Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez would lead the Peronist ticket, instead of her. When she does appear in public, Mrs. Kirchner draws large crowds of cheering supporters.\n\nOn Saturday, during a presentation of her new book in the city of La Plata, Mrs. Kirchner said she didn\u2019t want to be vice president, but was doing so to unify the Peronists, who were fractured in recent years. And she blamed Mr. Macri for the financial crisis, saying he was beholden to business interests.\n\n\u201cThese neoliberal recipes\u2026 never again,\u201d said Mrs. Kirchner. \u201cLet\u2019s seriously try to have a project for the country that is long lasting and viable.\u201d\n\nWrite to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com", "description": "The president of Argentina is implementing financial-interventionist policies that he once railed against as he confronts market turmoil sparked by a crisis of confidence in his embattled administration.", "authors": ["Ryan Dube", "Ryan.Dube Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103306/social"}
