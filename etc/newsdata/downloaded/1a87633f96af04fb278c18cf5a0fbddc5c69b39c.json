Yet it goes without saying that the more a nation defers to global power, the more it loses control over its destiny. (See: Brexit.)\n\nTrump noted how China was let into the World Trade Organization on the hope that it would reform and respect the rule of law. Instead it embraced \u201cmassive market barriers\u201d and \u201cthe theft of intellectual property.\u201d\n\nYet globalism\u2019s \u201creligious pull\u201d led leaders to \u201cignore their own national interest\u201d and China\u2019s contempt for fair play.\n\nThe president was likewise honest about Iran, citing its \u201crecord of death and destruction\u201d and \u201cfanatical quest for nuclear weapons.\u201d He warned \u201call nations\u201d not to \u201csubsidize Iran\u2019s bloodlust.\u201d\n\nTrump also called out \u201cradical\u201d migrant activists, who \u201cpromote human smuggling\u201d by encouraging illegal immigration. His message to them: \u201cYour policies are not just\u201d but \u201ccruel and evil.\u201d Migrants are \u201cexploited\u201d and abused by \u201cvicious coyotes,\u201d yet activists put their own \u201cfalse sense of virtue\u201d before the \u201cwell-being\u201d of those on whose behalf they agitate.\n\nTrump\u2019s blunt message wasn\u2019t just refreshing but sorely needed at this gathering of deceitful leaders and moral pretenders.", "description": "That was some speech President Trump gave Tuesday at the UN General Assembly \u2014 making a case against globalism, blasting China and Iran and exposing border-activist policies as \u201ccruel and evil.\u201d", "authors": ["Post Editorial Board", "September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/united_nations_ga.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
