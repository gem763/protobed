While its list of successful recipients includes J-Go, it does not specifically name SuperSisters.\n\n\"BSBT is an open and transparent programme, which supports local people in their vital work to bring communities together, promote fundamental values and tackle the spread of all extremist ideologies,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe platform launched in 2015, in response to the actions of Shamima Begum, who fled Britain to join the Islamic State group in Syria at the age of 15.\n\nIn a statement on its website, J-Go said it had accepted the grant to pay its staff a living wage and countering extremism was part of its purpose.\n\n\"We want to emphasise that even though BSBT may fund us, they do not have any creative control over SuperSisters content,\" it said.\n\nSuperSisters's former social media manager Sabah Ismail told the Guardian she had left in August after finding out about the grant.\n\nHowever, J-Go said it was \"clear and transparent\" about its funding to all interviewed candidates, including Ms Ismail.\n\nMs Ismail has been contacted by BBC News for comment.\n\nIn August, it was revealed the Home Office was behind a social news network called This is Woke, which featured discussions about many aspects of the Muslim faith.\n\nThat was part of a government counter-terrorism programme called Prevent, which SuperSisters said it had originally received money from but this had stopped because \"what we did was not deemed suitable for the Prevent funding\".", "description": "The SuperSisters platform, for young Muslim women, says it has retained full control over its output.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/75E6/production/_108828103_gettyimages-646051366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
