This is consistent with a global trend that see men being more likely to teach adolescents than young children.\n\nA lack of male teachers for young children has become the focus of a growing body of research internationally. Typically, this research has examined the experiences of male educators and explanations for their absence.\n\nThis work has appeared amid a global gender equity movement and adjacent to calls for greater female representation in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and in senior managerial positions.\n\nIn South Africa, research focusing on male teachers has emerged alongside recent calls to increase the involvement of men in the lives of young children. Around 43% of children under the age of 5 live without a biological father. Here, young children\u2019s observations of men as caring are particularly limited.\n\nTo date, our research has considered how experiences of childhood are shaped by gender, sexuality, race, class and culture, and affected by poverty, violence, and the spread of HIV. In addition, we\u2019ve investigated how interactions and relationships between teachers and students are shaped by gender and behaviour. Together, this work has contributed to understanding child development and the social forces that construct and reinforce \u201ctraditional\u201d views of masculinity and femininity.\n\nIn our most recent research, we explored how masculinity is constructed and perceived by female and male teachers in the early years of schooling. To better understand why few men teach in the early years of schooling, we investigated the experiences of male teachers and how they were perceived by their female colleagues.\n\nIn doing so, we came to better understand why men might avoid this work, but also the reasons why schools should include both female and male teachers.\n\nStereotypes\n\nFor men to choose to work as teachers of children in the early years of schooling, they must first overcome gender barriers.\n\nFor example, gender expectations and stereotypes strongly influence why men shy away from teaching \u2013 with teaching often viewed as \u201cwomen\u2019s work\u201d and associated with the care and nurturing of young children. Consequently, men who teach young children may have their masculinity questioned or scrutinised, and not be seen as \u201creal men\u201d.\n\nTeaching young children, however, requires a balance of stereotypically feminine and masculine traits: the teacher must be caring, yet authoritative, a listener, and a leader. Schools also benefit when teachers reflect the interests, needs and backgrounds of their students. One important way this can be done is by including both male and female teachers.\n\nTo understand how men are perceived in the teaching profession, we spoke to male teachers and their female colleagues.\n\nOur research found that there were conflicting accounts of men\u2019s roles. Some teachers welcomed men, and others strongly condemned associations between men and young children.\n\nThose that thought that men were important in children\u2019s lives connected men with stereotypical male roles. They reported an expectation that male teachers should display traditional masculine traits, and be \u201csportsmen\u201d and \u201cdisciplinarians\u201d.\n\nIn this way, male teachers were seen as socially acceptable when their behaviour conformed with pre-existing ideas of men: reproducing the dominant notions of masculine power that position men as being more suitable for management positions.\n\nOn a more progressive note, some of our findings show support for male teachers who can show children caring and non-violent ways of being a man. The need for such male teachers stems from a wider societal problem in South Africa.\n\nWhy gender diversity matters\n\nIn a recent announcement capturing global attention, the South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa, described the rates of violence against women and children as being similar to a country at war; announcing an emergency action plan to deal with gender-based violence.\n\nAs gender scholars, we are greatly concerned about how existing gendered perceptions about men may affect perceptions of male teachers too: particularly if men are uniformly positioned as bad. The fact is that male teachers can provide a source of hope. Indeed, men are not a single group of perpetrators, and some care for children deeply.\n\nIn our recent collaboration with researchers in Australia, and focusing on a shortage of male teachers in both countries, we identified additional reasons why teacher gender diversity is important for children, for classrooms, for schools, and for society.\n\nFor young children, male teachers can contribute to children\u2019s gender knowledge. This may be particularly important for some children \u2014 allowing them to observe men who are non-violent and whose interactions with women are positive. For other children, male teachers may increase their understanding of how to interact with adults who are different to themselves \u2014 promoting positive relationships between men and young children.\n\nFor schools, having a diverse workforce of teachers in foundation phase can also enhance decision making processes. People from different backgrounds may see the same problem in different ways, leading to innovative solutions. Workforce diversity has also been linked to improved performance and job satisfaction.\n\nDiversity\n\nThe presence of male teachers in the early year of schooling may help promote gender equitable versions of masculinity. By working in roles that are typically viewed as being more appropriate for women, men can break down the polarised differences that foster gender inequalities.\n\nMuch remains to be done in creating a diverse workforce \u2014 one which recognises men and women outside of gender stereotypes.\n\nBut in South Africa there is little policy imperative in addressing the missing men in the early years of schooling. For communities to promote positive representations of men, including men at this schooling phase, the focus must be on creating gender harmony and peace.\n\nDeevia Bhana, Professor Gender and Childhood Sexuality, University of KwaZulu-Natal; Kevin F.
