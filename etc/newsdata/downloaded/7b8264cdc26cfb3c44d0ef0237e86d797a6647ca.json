Instead, she claims the election was stolen from her. She has uncritically peddled that falsehood in countless interviews on national television and has capitalized off of it, by starting the group Fair Fight.\n\nFair Fight just launched a multimillion-dollar \u201cvoter protection\u201d initiative for the 2020 election in 20 competitive states. As the face of the group, Abrams stands to benefit politically from the increased national presence. This begs the question: Is Fair Fight about fighting voter suppression or raising Abrams\u2019 profile?\n\nThe Associated Press recently raised this conundrum by pointing out that the \u201corganization has paid for advertisements featuring Abrams and some of her travel and organized national watch parties when she delivered the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump Donald John Trump Poll: 40 percent of voters don't think Trump will win reelection Mattis: 'I'll speak out' about policy issues 'when the time comes' China contests Trump claim it is fentanyl source MORE\u2019s State of the Union.\u201d And while there is no evidence of illegality, Abrams\u2019 actions \u201ccould prompt questions about whether the nonprofit is inappropriately supporting her political ambitions,\u201d the AP's report stated.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA conservative watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, filed an IRS complaint pointing to \u201croughly $100,000 worth of Facebook ads featuring Abrams, an advertisement for a \u2018Stacey Abrams Fundraiser\u2019 that featured Fair Fight Action\u2019s logo, travel for Abrams\u2019 post-election \u2018thank you\u2019 tour of Georgia and a professionally produced \u2018highlight reel\u2019 of Abrams footage on the group\u2019s website.\u201d Fair Fight is also staffed by her former campaign aides.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Abrams appears to have benefited from the issue of voters\u2019 rights. The Atlanta Journal Constitution raised other concerns ahead of the 2018 election. Between 2013 and 2016, the newspaper reported, Abrams raised $12.5 million for the Third Sector Development and the Voter Access Institute, both non-profits and tax-exempt. Abrams wouldn\u2019t say \u201cwhere the money came from, even though the two foundations paid her, over three years, nearly half a million dollars,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\nA voter-drive effort by Third Sector Development and New Georgia Project prompted an investigation by Abrams\u2019 eventual gubernatorial rival Kemp, who was then Georgia's secretary of state, and the state's board of elections; Kemp's investigation ultimately found no wrongdoing by New Georgia Project but questioned some of the voter applications and registration contractors.\n\nThe groups\u2019 efforts to register and reach minority voters apparently were a failure, however. The Democratic Party got \u201cjust 3 percent more votes for governor in 2014 than in 2010, and turnout among African-American voters declined by more than 2 percentage points,\u201d as the Atlanta Journal Constitution noted. However, it was a win for Abrams\u2019 career: The foundations gave her access to wealthy progressive activists who went on to support her gubernatorial ambitions and many of the groups\u2019 aides and consultants worked on her 2018 campaign. As the AJC noted last year, \u201cthe foundations\u2019 greatest successes\u201d were \u201ccreating the infrastructure that undergirds Abrams\u2019 gubernatorial campaign.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse than Abrams using these groups as a launchpad for her career is the fact that Fair Fight appears to be predicated on a false premise. Despite her claims of voter suppression, Georgia had more than 6.9 million registered voters heading into the 2018 midterm elections. That is the most registered voters in the state\u2019s history. Almost 4 million Georgians voted in the midterm elections, which neared presidential levels. Further, minority voters made up a record 40 percent of the electorate, 30 percent were African American.\n\nDespite her unfounded claims of voter suppression and a history of using voting groups to raise her profile, the media has uncritically pushed her false narrative and fawned over her. Vogue even recently profiled her in a piece called, \u201cCan Stacey Abrams Save American Democracy?\u201d But if her past foundations are any indication, Abrams\u2019 isn\u2019t trying to save democracy \u2014 she's trying to boost her own career.\n\nLisa Boothe is a senior fellow of Independent Women's Voice, a conservative policy organization, and a Fox News contributor.
