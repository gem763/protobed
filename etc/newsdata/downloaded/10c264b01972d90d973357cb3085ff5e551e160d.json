It is not believed the couple were home at the time, having yet to return from the holiday.\n\nPolice have attended Jamie and Rebekah Vardy's home this afternoon after Mrs Vardy received apparent death threats in the wake of her row with Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen\n\nOfficers were at the mansion for around 20 minutes in an apparent call regarding security\n\nRebekah has increased the security at her home to 24/7 surveillance following the saga with Coleen.\n\nSources close to the star said police were at her property this afternoon ahead of her children coming home from school to ensure the area was safe.\n\nThe couple's lawyers are said to have advised her to stay in Dubai \u2013 despite her wanting to come home.\n\nThey believe she is safer overseas until the situation has calmed down and the threat from trolls decreases, but Rebekah was keen to fly home immediately to be with family.\n\nEarlier today, Rebekah, who is pregnant with her fifth child, went on Instagram to complain about the horrific abuse she has received since the 'story selling' scandal emerged.\n\nShe said she had received death threats, as well as a vile message calling her a 'sly c**t' and saying: 'I hope that baby dies within you B***H'.\n\nThe marked police car pulled up outside the property and the officer made a telephone as he waited for the Vardys' electric security gate to be opened.\n\nHe was greeted by the caretaker of the house and went inside.\n\nPregnant Rebekah, pictured with her husband last month, has published some of the messages she has received online\n\nOne of the threats she received stated that the sender wished death upon her unborn child\n\nA Lincolnshire police spokesman would be drawn on the reason for the visit.\n\nRebekah has refuted claims made by reality TV star Danielle Lloyd - the wife of footballer Jamie O'Hara - who waded into the row with an appearance on ITV's This Morning.\n\nMs Vardy, the wife of Leicester City striker Jamie, was at the centre of drama on social media yesterday when Coleen posted a message saying she had spent months trying to work out who was sharing stories about her.\n\nColeen wrote: 'For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n'There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n'After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.'\n\nColeen Rooney, Wayne Rooney's wife, made the shock claims on Instagram yesterday\n\nRooney, 33, said she 'came up with an idea' - she blocked everyone apart from an Instagram page belonging to Vardy from seeing her Instagram stories and over the 'past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper'.\n\nColeen said stories she had falsified about 'gender selection in Mexico, and the story about returning to TV, and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house', had all made it into the newspaper.\n\n'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked; however, I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it's come from.\n\n'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n'It's ... Rebekah Vardy's account.'\n\n'Rebekah denied all accusations against her minutes after Coleen's explosive post\n\nDenying the allegations, former I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! star Vardy replied to Rooney: 'If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped.\n\n'Over the years various people have had access to my insta & just this week I found I was following people I didn't know and have never followed myself.'\n\nShe added: 'I'm not being funny but I don't need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you?'\n\nVardy said she was 'so upset' that Rooney had made the accusation and she was 'disgusted that I'm even having to deny this'.\n\n'You should have called me the first time this happened,' she told Rooney.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Rebekah and Jamie Vardy are currently on holiday in Dubai after Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen made bombshell claims that Rebekah yesterday.", "authors": ["Charlie Walker", "Richard Spillett For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19544290-0-image-a-27_1570718531638.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
