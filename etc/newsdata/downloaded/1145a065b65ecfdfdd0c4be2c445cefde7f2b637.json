Warren has been rising in the polls, and some of her rivals have begun criticizing her policies, but the impeachment furor could make that harder with so much attention focused on Trump.\n\n\u201cThe way to hold this president of the United States accountable is to impeach him,\u201d Warren told reporters after Friday\u2019s town hall. \u201cSo I hope we go forward with care and deliberation, but that we do it quickly. I think it\u2019s important. The American people are counting on us.\u201d\n\nSome Warren allies say that she is well-suited to talk about the issue because it is in line with one of her core campaign themes \u2014 tackling corruption. \u201cFor Elizabeth Warren, it\u2019s right in the middle of the bull\u2019s eye,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which has endorsed Warren. \u201cAssuming this keeps going, I would be surprised if she didn\u2019t integrate it more and more into her stump speech.\u201d\n\nStill, the current landscape presents the paradox that if Trump were to be removed \u2014 a remote prospect at the moment \u2014 the Democratic nominee would presumably be running against Vice President Pence, not the figure they\u2019ve been railing against for months.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Impeachment-Furor-Throws-The-Democratic-Campaign-Into-Uncertain-Territory"], "top_image": ""}
