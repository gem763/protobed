We have a good squad, a good bench and the performance was excellent.\u201d\n\nNorwich doubled the lead from a counter-attack when Pukki carried the ball forward, drawing City defender Kyle Walker out of position before teeing up an unmarked Todd Cantwell who tapped the ball into an empty net.\n\n\u201cWe got off to a flyer and we knew they would have plenty of the ball,\u201d McLean added. \u201cWe knew the counter-attack and set pieces would be vital for us and it worked out that way.\u201d\n\nSergio Aguero halved the lead at the stroke of halftime when he found space between the two centre backs and nodded home Bernardo Silva\u2019s cross to maintain his run of scoring in every league game so far this season.\n\nMan City defender Nicolas Otamendi gifted Norwich a third when he dallied on the ball and allowed Buendia to steal in and take it off him to set up Pukki for his sixth goal of the season as manager Guardiola fumed on the bench.\n\nRodri, Man City\u2019s club record signing, set up a tense finish to the match when he fired in his first goal for the club. But Norwich held on to take all three points.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t praise enough the spirit and mentality of my players because it was an unbelievably complicated week,\u201d Norwich boss Daniel Farke said.\n\n\u201cIt is a great day for us, for the whole club and for the supporters. Carrow Road is absolutely buzzing and it\u2019s a win for our owners because they are such kind-hearted people and we cannot ask for better owners.\u201d\n\nThe result leaves Man City five points behind league leaders Liverpool while Norwich, who became the first promoted side to beat Guardiola\u2019s team in the Premier League, have moved up to 12th.", "description": "An injury-ravaged Norwich City outclassed champions Manchester City 3-2 in the Premier League on Saturday with striker Teemu Pukki scoring one and setting up another for a famous win at Carrow Road.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1429997140&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E02D", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
