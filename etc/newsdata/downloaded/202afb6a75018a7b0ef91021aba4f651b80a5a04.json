It might just pass the new filter:\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n\nEither way, you\u2019re probably going to start seeing a lot more of this type of thing on your feed:\n\nWhy now?\n\nAccording to the Canadian Paediatric Society, there's a link between social media use and negative body image, including eating disorders.\n\nThat matches what Zeppieri is seeing.\n\nTeens are being \u201cbombarded\u201d with images that promote \u201ca warped idea of what it means to be healthy,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that this announcement starts a ripple effect of positive change on the content youth see in their social media feeds,\" Zeppieri said.\n\nActor Jameela Jamil, who stars in the NBC TV comedy The Good Place and has been advocating against weight-loss products on Instagram, is also applauding the changes.\n\nInstagram users need \u201cprotection from the celebrities and influencers that they follow,\u201d said Jamil, who struggled with an eating disorder as a teen.\n\nThe campaign she started to fight self-hatred, called I Weigh, now has almost 900,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nOther changes\n\nInstagram continues to make adjustments to address mental health issues.\n\nIn 2018, it released a feature that allows users to track the time they spend on Instagram each day.\n\nEarlier this year, the platform also started testing the removal of \u201clike\" counts in Canada.", "description": "Instagram\u2019s parent company, Facebook, has announced it\u2019s cracking down on posts that promote diet products and cosmetic surgery.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.cbc.ca/kidsnews//content/_card_resize/DietThumb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
