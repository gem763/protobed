The (now $140) winter parka could be spotted on sidewalks across Manhattan and earned internet fame for its thousands of reviews. This summer, it was the tassel-trimmed high-waist bikini that made it into beach bags from the East to West coast.\n\nSo what will it be fall\u2019s must-have Amazon fashion find? We\u2019re predicting it will be this $32 Amazon teddy coat.\n\nAmazon This teddy coat comes in five colors, and is available in a zip-up version.\n\nCoats are a major part of fall fashion. We already have our eye on a few outerwear trends for 2019, and teddy coats are at the top of our list. This PrettyGarden Faux Shearling Coat is an Amazon best-seller with a 4-star rating and more than 1,000 reviews.\n\nIt comes in five autumnal colors (tan, black, brown, green and cream) and in sizes S to 3X, and it\u2019s sold for just $32. It has an oversized collar and lapels with double-breasted buttons and side pockets, so it can easily pull any jeans-and-sweater combo into a more polished look.\n\nIt\u2019s also available in a more casual zip-up style from the same seller, if you want something for quick coffee-runs or more laid-back streetwear. Either way, we\u2019re predicting you\u2019ll see more of this coat before the winter is through.", "description": "It has more than 1,000 reviews so far.", "authors": ["Commerce Specialist"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7927013b0000c49fd0caf3.png?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
