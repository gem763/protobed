Bush at the Cowboys-Packers game.\n\n\u201cAs I always say with the mob, it\u2019s like a wildfire, if you pour gasoline on it, it\u2019ll eventually get you as well,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re angry with her because once held a position that went after people like this and so now it\u2019s turned on her.\"\n\nDeGeneres gave a monologue to her audience on Monday, explaining that she and Portia de Rossi were invited to the game by Charlotte Jones, the daughter of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.\n\nELLEN DEGENERES STANDS UP TO TWITTER MOB, DEFENDS APPEARING WITH 'FRIEND' GEORGE W. BUSH\n\n\"When we were invited, I was aware that I was going to be surrounded with people from very different views and beliefs. And I'm not talking about politics... I was rooting for the Packers,\" DeGeneres joked. \"So I had to hide my cheese hat in Portia's purse.\"\n\nDeGeneres faced heavy criticism on social media for appearing alongside Bush. Jones mentioned that DeGeneres defended Kevin Hart after his controversial tweets toward homosexuality resurfaced.\n\nHe argued that Hart is friends with DeGeneres, unlike pastor Kim Burrell, whose appearance on \"Ellen\" was nixed in 2017 over comments about gays and lesbians.\n\n'SOUTH PARK' CREATORS OFFER TONGUE-IN-CHEEK 'APOLOGY' TO CHINA AFTER SHOW GETS BANNED: 'WE COOL NOW?'\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem, she\u2019s attacked people for that position in the past and it seems like when people become her friends, she defends those people,\" Jones argued.\n\n\u201cWhen [it is] people that she knows, she comes to their defense, but if it were someone else, she would\u2019ve criticized him and I think that\u2019s something we should shun in America. ... I like Ellen, I love that she's big about charities, she gives a lot to the community, I think that's all great. But I think it's important that we have one standard and that is no matter what your position is, you have the freedom in America to have that position.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Joseph A.
