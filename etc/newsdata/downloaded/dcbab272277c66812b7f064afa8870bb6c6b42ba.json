Most August polls showed Biden with the support of nearly one in three Democratic voters nationally, far ahead of his nearest presidential opponent and basically unchanged from polling before he announced his campaign.\n\nThat resilience has created a challenge for many of the former vice president\u2019s rivals as the summer comes to a close. Their routes to the nomination depend on winning over current Biden supporters, but his staying power has yet to offer a lasting opportunity to chip away.\n\nIn response, top advisers to many of his rivals have counseled that the only path forward they see is to continue to cast their candidates as younger, more transformative or more energetic change agents, figure out how to maintain their spot on the debate stage, and hope that the mercurial history of Iowa and New Hampshire voters repeats itself, torpedoing Biden\u2019s bid as they have not.\n\n\u201cCome January, voters are going to give candidates a hard final look and make a decision about who to support,\u201d said Justin Buoen, the campaign manager for Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). \u201cBetween now and then is a lifetime.\u201d\n\nBut just what could bring down Biden remains an open question among campaigns. Some hope that his verbal struggles in debates and at campaign events, including recent misstatements in a tale of military heroism, could feed growing concern about nominating a man who would be the oldest U.S. president in history. Many discount the value of current polls, since so many voters have yet to focus on the choice and many are open to changing their minds.\n\nOthers have grown increasingly skeptical that direct challenges to his record will change the dynamics of the race. Rather than risk alienating his supporters, they are choosing to build a broader argument about generational or policy change \u2014 an implicit contrast to Biden and his central pledge to \u201crestore the soul\u201d of the nation and revisit the popular parts of the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t look like our message is to just, kind of, turn back the clock and go back to normal,\u201d South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said on a campaign swing through Iowa last month. \u201cThere\u2019s no \u2018again.\u2019 It\u2019s about making sure that the future is better than the past and representing something that\u2019s going to be new and different.\u201d\n\nSome candidates, including former housing and urban development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, have begun to more explicitly urge Democrats to move out of the safety of the familiar.\n\n\u201cIf you take a look at the modern era of presidential campaigns, when Democrats have won, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve taken a bit of a risk, whether it was Kennedy in 1960, or Carter in 1976, or Barack Obama in 2008,\u201d Castro said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press.\u201d\n\nThis approach will again be on display at the next debate in Houston on Sept. 12, when Biden will for the first time be confronted by all of his opponents registering in the polls, each of them eager to contrast their visions and styles. For the first time, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) will share the center of the stage with Biden after appearing on separate nights over the summer debates and mostly avoiding direct confrontation with him despite a long history of policy disagreement.\n\n\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) spars with Biden during the July debate in Detroit. (Paul Sancya/Associated Press)\n\nIt remains unclear, however, whether his rivals will repeat the direct assaults on Biden of the first two contests. At several points since he entered the race in April, such efforts against Biden have rewarded his attackers with attention, fundraising bumps and fleeting polling shifts. But they have also sometimes backfired.\n\nIn the first Democratic debate in June, Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) staked his campaign on demanding Biden \u201cpass the torch\u201d to younger candidates, only to abandon his presidential effort days later. In the last big moment of her campaign, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) launched an assault on Biden at the July debate, arguing that a 1981 opinion piece he had written showed disrespect for women who work outside the home. She dropped out last week after failing to qualify for the September debate.\n\nThe most successful challenge came from Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who denounced Biden\u2019s opposition to school busing with a well-delivered personal story of her own childhood at a recently desegregated school. But she was unable to turn the moment into anything more than a temporary bump in fundraising and polling support.\n\nHer advisers remain convinced that the confrontation will help her campaign down the road, though since then she has not made Biden a major part of her message.\n\n\u201cIn the first debate, she showed strength and viability,\u201d said Ian Sams, her national press secretary. \u201cAnd we think that will stick in people\u2019s minds for the rest of the primary.\u201d\n\nPart of the challenge for Biden\u2019s detractors is the historically low appetite among Democrats for interparty fights.\n\n\u201cAnytime you are in a multicandidate primary, the aggressor is not the direct beneficiary of an attack,\u201d said Jeff Link, an Iowa Democratic strategist, who has worked for the presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Obama. \u201cTypically someone else benefits because nobody likes an attack.\u201d\n\nThat happened in 2004, when Rep. Dick Gephardt (Mo.) unleashed a blistering attack on Vermont Gov. Howard Dean days before the Iowa caucuses, calling him a \u201cweather-vane Democrat\u201d with \u201cfalse conviction.\u201d The attack helped sink polling support for Gephardt and Dean, allowing Sen. John F. Kerry (Mass.) to win the state.\n\nBiden, who has run for president twice before, knows this history well and has parried the attacks on him by admitting mistakes over the course of the campaign, including his decision to discuss his past working relationship with segregationist Democratic senators.\n\nBefore joining the race, he vowed without apologizing to be \u201cmore mindful and respectful of people\u2019s personal space\u201d after several women said his close physical contact had made them uncomfortable. Later, under direct criticism from many in the field, he reversed his position on federal funding for abortion, embracing it for the first time.\n\nHe has also warned his rivals that a fiercely negative fight could hurt the party, bringing the discussion back to his central contention that he is best able to defeat President Trump in a general election.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be forming a circular firing squad and shooting, because all it does is help Trump,\u201d he said during a meeting last week with black reporters in Washington.\n\nHis aides think Biden\u2019s longtime relationship with Democratic voters has allowed him to survive the attacks. Voters, they say, shrug off his gaffes and new facts about his history because they have watched him for so long in public life.\n\n\u201cWhen the press or other candidates make a big deal about something he says, they look at it and they roll their eyes,\u201d said John Anzalone, a pollster for the Biden campaign. \u201cVoters know Joe Biden. They have a feel for this guy.\u201d\n\nThey also have firmly cast him as the candidate best positioned to defeat Trump, a high priority for most Democratic voters.\n\n\u201cDemocratic primary voters just want someone who is going to win, period, and right now he still occupies that space like no one else does,\u201d said Glen Caplin, who served as a senior adviser to Gillibrand\u2019s campaign. \u201cBut it\u2019s still early, with a lot of time for that to change.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s two closest rivals, Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), have so far taken different approaches toward him. Sanders has repeatedly tried to use Biden as an establishment foil for his anti-establishment campaign, holding him up as an obstacle to progress.\n\nHe accused Biden of \u201csounding like Donald Trump\u201d in July around health-care policy, and has repeatedly called out Biden\u2019s past support for free-trade deals and the Iraq War and criticized his approach to climate change as insufficient. At one point this summer, Sanders\u2019s campaign released an online quiz that challenged voters to guess whether quotes had been uttered by Biden or Republicans such as Trump or Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nWarren, by contrast, has taken a far less confrontational approach, not just to Biden but to other Democrats in the race. Like Buttigieg and Castro, who also has focused on generational change, Warren has tried to build a broader thematic contrast with Biden, usually without mentioning his name.\n\n\u201cSome Democrats in Washington believe the only way forward is to make change incrementally, a few tweaks here and some nudges there,\u201d she told Democratic activists at a party meeting in San Francisco on Aug. 22. \u201cNo. This is a time of crisis, and when you\u2019re in a crisis \u2014 when your back is up against the wall \u2014 the last thing you do is back down from the big fights.\u201d\n\nThrough the first two sets of debates this summer, Warren and Biden did not appear on the same stage, but that will change in Houston. The moment could burst open an often tense private relationship between the two politicians.\n\nAsked repeatedly in April about her past fights with Biden over a bankruptcy reform bill, which she opposed and he supported, she was hesitant to go into detail about the split but nonetheless previewed the battle to come.\n\n\u201cLook, our disagreement is a matter of public record,\u201d she said. \u201cJoe Biden was on the side of credit card companies.\u201d", "description": "Despite the gaffes and criticisms, the former vice president\u2019s support among Democratic voters has remained strong.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/7VF_qhtKoNQnbJ46rddfgygsIXc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/X475YUV3M4I6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg"}
