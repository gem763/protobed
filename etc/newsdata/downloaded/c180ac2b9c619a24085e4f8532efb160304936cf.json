But in my view, he'd be better off remaining with Brescia.\n\n'The other day, his agent and his parents were telling me about this \u20ac50m evaluation. I replied that for me he is worth \u20ac300m, which means I don't want to sell.\n\n'I have a dream. If Sandro accepts, I am ready to make a big financial sacrifice to extend his contract.\n\nBrescia president Massimo Cellino, seen here at Mario Balotelli's unveiling, values Tonali at \u20ac300million and is desperate for him to stay with the club\n\nTonali won his first international cap for Italy in their recent qualifier with Liechtenstein\n\n'It's up to him to decide. He can stay here and enjoy his football, or go to a big club and risk being left on the bench.'\n\nWith Tonali clearly catching the eye of some of the continent's elite clubs, Cellino was prepared to wax lyrical about his talents.\n\n'His talent is clear for all to see, but the truly special thing about Sandro is his smile,' he said. 'He loves to play football and the rest is of no real interest to him.\n\n'There is always the risk with young players that sudden fame can create problems, but he is doing so well. I believe he can become even better, as I've never had such a good player in my squad.\n\n'Tonali sacrifices himself so much for the team with his defensive work, but if he were to move to a more advanced role, he'd score more goals. You see, he's got a great shot.'\n\nHe was on target on Saturday but Brescia lost 3-1 at Genoa.", "description": "Brescia star Sandro Tonali is attracting interest from a host of leading European clubs but the Italian club's president Massimo Cellino claims he is worth \u00a3260million.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20240810-0-image-a-10_1572174632229.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
