Over the decades, he amassed some of the biggest portfolios of apartments, office buildings, and other property types in the US. He told CNBC on Wednesday that he's seen many companies like WeWork that leased space, subdivided it, and then leased it out \u2014 and he even invested in one. None ended well.\n\nRead more: We got a peek at WeWork's top landlords. Here's who is most exposed to the fast-growing, but money-losing, coworking company as it prepares to IPO.\n\n\"Every single company in this space has gone broke,\" he said, noting the mismatch between long-term liabilities and short-term assets. \"Every other time in history when they do that, the results are predictable. Why is this any different?\"\n\nZell's comments come as WeWork, registered as The We Company, prepares for its initial public offering. Its road show could start as soon as next week, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOn CNBC, Zell criticized WeWork's heavy losses, which makes its path to profitability unclear. In the first half of the year, WeWork had a loss of $690 million on $1.5 billion in revenue.\n\nZell also slammed WeWork's governance model, calling the dual-class share structure \"preposterous.\" Many tech companies have embraced the structure, which gives management special shares with extra voting power, as a way for executives to maintain more control in public markets.\n\nAdam Neumann, the cofounder and CEO of WeWork, has shares that give him even more votes than those held by his peers. Neumann gets 20 votes per share with his superpowered stock; other CEOs with such stock usually get about 10 votes per share.\n\n\"I'm the chairman of five New York Stock Exchange companies,\" Zell said. \"Every one of my companies has no separation between my vote and anybody else's vote. The idea that these companies should have multiple votes or control a company forever or not be accountable just doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\nA spokesman for WeWork declined to comment.\n\nRead more: Here's what we know about Fibra Uno, the Mexico real estate company that's WeWork's biggest landlord. It highlights how quickly the co-working company has been growing overseas.\n\nZell also criticized the wider real-estate industry for over-leasing to coworking providers, not just WeWork. He said the industry \"has committed suicide\" by leasing too much space to coworking companies that lack the good credit of more-traditional tenants.\n\nThe commercial-real-estate firm JLL predicts that flexible office space will jump to 30% of US office space by 2030 from less than 5% now.\n\n\"If you're too big to fail, what happens is you can't make your payments,\" he said. \"You go back to the landlord and say, 'gee I'm sorry I can't make my payments, change the rent.' That doesn't do a lot for the equity holder. It may protect the bondholder. Maybe.\"", "description": "Zell, who got his start in real estate, criticized WeWork's unusual governance model and the industry has a whole for leasing too much to coworking.", "authors": ["Meghan Morris"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d6fe13a2e22af2e4f188482?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-04"}
