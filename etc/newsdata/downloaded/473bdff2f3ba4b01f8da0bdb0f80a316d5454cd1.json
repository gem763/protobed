Indeed, rather than marking a point of departure, it extends a long narrative. With 2010\u2019s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and 2013\u2019s Yeezus, he vented about his selfishness and lust as he geared up for marriage. The dirty gospel of 2016\u2019s The Life of Pablo and bipolar-pride riffs of 2018\u2019s Ye then saw him straining to reconcile family with his inner hedonist. \u201cI been living without limits,\u201d he said on Pablo\u2019s \u201cFML,\u201d but as the title of that song indicated, his old life was now, in a word, fucked. Three years later, after a lurch into the simplistic delusions of Trumpism, he\u2019s more fully embraced Christianity\u2019s rules, including by swearing off swearing. So far, he suggested in an interview with Zane Lowe, the biggest struggle for him has been giving up porn.\n\nAll along, West has understood Christianity as an engine of innovations for the human voice. In the black church, the sorrow and hope of slave spirituals were institutionalized and embossed into works through which soloists could reach seemingly unthinkable heights with the firm anchoring of a community. Soul and its pop derivations grew directly from gospel\u2019s breakthroughs. In Europe, a holy harmonic tradition stretched from medieval abbeys through the compositions of Bach and Handel to heavy metal. Especially on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and The Life of Pablo, West raided from multiple divine lineages with rich choirs and countermelodies set to pop\u2019s and hip-hop\u2019s grids.\n\nThe scream of worship now meets the muffle of doctrine on Jesus Is King, a stunningly extreme and empty album. Take a breath before hitting Play: \u201cEvery Hour\u201d seems to start mid-measure\u2014I jumped\u2014with a hurricane in full force. The members of West\u2019s Sunday Service choir sing in ascending and descending zigzags, at a mishmash of tempos, as a piano spirals like a friendly gnat. The words arrive at such a pace that they resemble the hyper-speed samples that West so loves, and some of the vocalists praise God in the same distressed manner with which they\u2019d call out a thief who snatched their purse. For all the frenzy, not a note feels misplaced. West not only isolated and intensified what a choir usually climbs up to. He plated it as if it were a Grant Achatz dish.\n\nThat confetti-blast song works so well\u2014testifying not only to West\u2019s songwriting and arranging, but also to the talents of the Sunday Service choir\u2014that it might rank among his career\u2019s greatest achievements. Not coincidentally, West\u2019s voice isn\u2019t in the song. When he begins rapping on the next track, \u201cSelah,\u201d the excitement comes to a thud. Much of what one might fear from an evangelical Kanye West is here. Organs reach for awe as if it\u2019s a staple in the pantry. West\u2019s faith results in simplistically drawled boasts: \u201cGod is king, we the soldiers.\u201d It does get better, though. War drums knock in milliseconds offbeat\u2014a smart if grating regaining of attention\u2014and the choir\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d chorus provides respite from West\u2019s blas\u00e9 motto-slinging.", "description": "The rapper\u2019s Christian album is not a departure from his values but an intensification of them: boldness over coherence.", "authors": ["Spencer Kornhaber"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19111297370656/facebook.jpg?1572355586", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
