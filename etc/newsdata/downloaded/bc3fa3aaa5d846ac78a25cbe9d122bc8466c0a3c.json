HI INSTAGRAM.\u2019\n\nThe concept of Jennifer joining Instagram is all fans ever wanted, and the reunion is more than we could handle considering there hasn\u2019t been a complete reunion in years.\n\nAnd now that fans finally have what they want, of course it\u2019s only right to make sure something goes wrong with it.\n\nIt felt like Jennifer and her co-stars sat down and said to each other: \u2018We should give everyone what they want!\u2019 before Matthew looked at them and replied: \u2018Only if it\u2019s blurry enough that we look like Minecraft characters.\u2019\n\nSomebody explain why Matthew is barely in the photo please (Picture: Instagram)\n\nShe\u2019s trying her best guys (Picture: Twitter/@Staunty87)\n\nApparently Friends money is less than we thought (Picture: Twitter/@_hiiragishino)\n\nFans, as overjoyed as they were, quickly pointed out the quality of the photo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne fan posted: \u2018Is it just me or is Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Friends reunion pic a first draft selfie at best? Bad framing, obstructed faces, weird limbs\u2026 this moment deserved a retake.\u2019\n\nShall we all just start a GoFundMe for Jen so she can get a new phone?\n\n\u2018My fave part about this is that jennifer aniston doesn\u2019t have a good front camera. I know for a fact that friends money can get her something better,\u2019 one user tweeted.\n\nSomeone tweeted: \u2018Am wondering what kind of camera phone Jennifer Aniston used to take this low-res photo?\u2019\n\nFans were not impressed (Picture: Twitter/@mark_op)\n\nWe still can\u2019t wait to see what she shares with us (Picture: Twitter/@marziepanic)\n\nWe reckon at best she\u2019s got an iPhone 5s and at worst she\u2019s got an Android.\n\nOn the bright side, the actress already gained 7.1 million followers and all she had to do was upload a picture of some pixels.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
