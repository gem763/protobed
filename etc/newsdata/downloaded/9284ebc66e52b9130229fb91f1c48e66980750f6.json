Then why did we spend a decade, billions of dollars, and lost lives in trying to curtail ISIS if on a phone call, on a whim, the President is going to undo all of that and turn this over to the Turks and the Syrians? I would also say one other thing. He was insulting, particularly to the Speaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe kept her cool completely,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut he called her a third-rate politician. He said that there are communists involved, and you guys might like that. This was not a dialogue. It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe, not focused on the facts. Particularly the fact of how to curtail ISIS, a terrorist organization that aims to hurt the United States in our homeland.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "On Wednesday, during a press conference outside the White House, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) accused President Donald Trump of insulting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) during a meeting with congressional leaders. | Clips", "authors": ["Pam Key"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1175311021-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
