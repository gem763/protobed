At the same time, the fact that 5G networks rely more on software that can be easily updated makes it harder to keep track of cyber threats.\n\nThe German rules come after the European Union last week warned of the risk of increased cyber attacks on 5G networks by state-backed actors. A report compiled by member states stopped short, however, of singling out China as a threat.\n\nNetwork operators Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE>, Vodafone <VOD.L> and Telefonica Deutschland <O2Dn.DE> would be required to identify and apply enhanced security standards to critical network elements, the Handelsblatt daily reported earlier, citing the draft rulebook.\n\nMore broadly, vendors should be certified as trustworthy, giving customers legal recourse to exclude them and seek damages if proof is found that equipment had been used for spying or sabotage.\n\nCertification of critical equipment would meanwhile have to be obtained from Germany's cybersecurity authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).\n\nThose requirements were in line with key ground rules set back in March ahead of the drafting of the full set of rules by the Federal Network Regulator (BNetzA) and the BSI.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Andreas Rinke; Writing by Vera Eckert and Douglas Busvine; Editing by Alexander Smith)", "description": "Germany has finalised rules for the build-out of 5G mobile networks that, in a snub to the United States, will not exclude China's Huawei Technologies.
