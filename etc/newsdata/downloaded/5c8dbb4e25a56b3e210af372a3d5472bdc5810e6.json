Green in Lost Year, but Who Could Be Buyers?", "language": "en", "text": "Frank Victores/Associated Press\n\nA.J. Green should never play another down for the Cincinnati Bengals. Neither he nor the organization benefits from the wide receiver's return to the lineup. Whereas, a trade benefits both parties.\n\nThe Bengals are well on their way to owning a top pick in the 2020 NFL draft. After losing 27-3 Monday to a Mason Rudolph-led Pittsburgh Steelers squad, Cincinnati entered another level of disappointment as one of the NFL's four 0-4 squads. The race for the No. 1 overall pick will be frighteningly awful, yet \"competitive.\"\n\nThe Bengals aren't intentionally tanking, like the Miami Dolphins, but it sure feels that way.\n\nMonday's meeting of winless franchises was a chance to provide hope. Both had a puncher's chance despite disappointing starts. A victory placed the winner one game behind the 2-2 Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens in the AFC North.\n\nThe Steelers made Cincinnati look like a junior varsity squad. The Bengals' offensive front operated in sieve-like fashion and allowed eights sacks and 12 more quarterback hits. The offense managed a meager 175 total yards. The defense, meanwhile, allowed Mason Rudolph to complete 24-of-28 passes for 229 yards and two touchdowns in his second-ever start.\n\nThere's no coming back from this point. The Bengals season entered lost territory, and organization's best player resides in limbo.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Green \"could be out a while\" after missing Monday's contest, though the receiver worked out prior to the blowout loss and will undergo a checkup later this week, per NFL Network's Tom Pelissero:\n\nGreen continues to deal with the aftereffects of preseason ankle surgery, and he should be in no rush to come back.\n\n\"He's certainly turned in the right direction,\" Taylor said last week, per the Sporting News' Chelsea Howard. \"I don't want to give any timeline\u2060\u2014next week, the week after, week after that. I don't want to get into that stuff. It will be exciting when we get him back.\"\n\nWill it, Coach? The season isn't exactly trending in the right direction. Maybe the seven-time Pro Bowl selection comes down with a case of the \"blue flu\" to avoid a disastrous situation.\n\nConversely, the Bengals should be eager to trade Green. Of course, he makes the team better overall, but his addition won't turn around the season. If retained, the Bengals will absorb the rest of his $15.176 million salary-cap hit this year before he becomes a free agent next offseason.\n\n\"Stuff is happening,\" Green said earlier in September regarding possible contract negotiations, per ESPN's Ben Baby. \"But we're trying to get healthy and make sure I'm fine to where I can go out there and play. I don't really get into all that. I let my agent handle all that other stuff.\"\n\nRun away, A.J. Run as fast and far away as you possibly can on your injured ankle. There's not a single reason why you should re-sign with Cincinnati when a plethora\u2014yes, he'll have a plethora, Jefe\u2014of contenders vie for your services.\n\nWhen healthy, the 31-year-old remains an elite target, though injuries have been problematic over the last two seasons. He's missed 11 games during that stretch and counting.\n\nCincinnati's front office may be a little old-fashioned and smaller than any other around the league. However, the approach seems simple: Look at the possibility of a baseball-like trade. Acquire assets now before the high-profile star leaves once he hits free agency. The hometown Reds did the same exact thing with Yasiel Puig this season.\n\nA half-season rental may not demand a large bounty, yet something is always better than nothing, especially with all of the holes found on Cincinnati's roster.\n\nA reallocation of assets is absolutely necessary based on the Bengals' current roster construction. Everything starts up front with the NFL's worst offensive line. Cincinnati signed Andre Smith off the street to start at left tackle after Jonah Williams and Cordy Glenn sustained injuries. A brand new left guard, Michael Jordan, and center, Trey Hopkins, start along the interior. Right guard John Miller is in his first season with the team, and Bobby Hart's retention as the starting right tackle is a catastrophe.\n\nOn the other hand, the skill positions provide some hope. John Ross III and Tyler Boyd are quite talented, especially with Ross finally living up to his potential, though he left Monday's game with an injury. Running back Joe Mixon is a big-time threat in and out of the backfield. Offensive weapons are available to excel even without Green, but the offensive line and quarterback are holding everything else back.\n\nGreen must escape the yoke of playing with Andy Dalton.\n\nThe opportunity to play with a top-flight quarterback will be quite tempting.\n\n\"Everything that we've done, we've experienced together,\" Dalton said of his relationship with Green, per Baby. \"It's been fun to grow closer as friends over the years. Obviously, we've had a great working relationship, but then you put more to that.\"\n\nFriendships last beyond football, as do championships. Green should be looking at the latter based on his current circumstances.\n\nThree potential trade partners fit the criteria of being contenders with outstanding quarterback play, a wide receiver need, available early-round draft picks and enough financial flexibility to sign Green beyond the 2019 campaign.\n\nSeattle Seahawks\n\nJohn Froschauer/Associated Press\n\nPete Carroll's approach to being consistently competitive works: The 3-1 Seahawks lean on a top-notch ground game, Russell Wilson's playmaking ability and solid defense.\n\nHowever, quality wide receiver play and depth is lacking.\n\nTyler Lockett's continued development makes him Seattle's WR1 and rightly so. But Green is a true X-receiver with the size (6'4\" and 210 pounds), route-running skills and body control to immediately take over as Wilson's favored option.\n\nRookie D.K. Metcalf brings similar qualities, but he's a work-in-progress and still learning the position's nuances.\n\nSeattle also has an extra second-round pick from the Frank Clark trade to entice Cincinnati.\n\nFor Green, the Seahawks own the sixth-most in projected 2020 salary-cap space at $80.47 million (before the organization tries to resign defensive end Jadeveon Clowney).\n\nGreen Bay Packers\n\nNuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images\n\nDavante Adams needs help in the worst way. Adams leads the Packers with 36 targets so far this season after he amassed a whopping 169 targets last year.\n\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling isn't a true No. 2 option, because Aaron Rodgers doesn't seem to trust him\u2014which is vital in this scenario. Rodgers is still feeling his way through Matt LaFleur's scheme and the Packers offense is slowly coming around, but the outside targets, sans Adams, don't consistently create for the quarterback.\n\nThe possibility of acquiring Green immediately gives Green Bay the league's best one-two wide receiver combination.\n\nThe Packers don't have nearly the same financial flexibility as Seattle, but general manager Brian Gutekunst can certainly work with the $24.06 million in projected cap space next year.\n\nNew England Patriots\n\nRon Schwane/Associated Press\n\nAny time a quality veteran becomes available or is believed to be available, the Patriots are immediately tabbed as options.\n\nTom Brady throwing to Green could be special opposite Josh Gordon with Julian Edelman working the slot. To make a deal happen, though, New England must find a way around Antonio Brown's grievances since he still accounts for $5.75 million in dead cap space thus leaving the Patriots with $5.26 million in available wiggle room.\n\nA reworking of Green's current deal as a stipluation in the event of a trade makes sense on two levels: The Patriots can get another Pro Bowl-caliber receiver on the roster and under the cap, while Green gets an extension now instead of later.\n\nIf it's possible, the Patriots will find a way to make it happen. They usually do.\n\nLife After Losing\n\nNine seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals is enough. The team trended up with Green leading the way. His production and relationships with Dalton and previous head coach Marvin Lewis helped turned a league laughing-stock into a multi-year playoff contender.\n\nBut that time is over. A new era is desperately needed in Cincinnati, and a complete rebuild is necessary. The first step of a rebuild is ridding oneself of high-priced veterans who no longer carry the same value for far cheaper draft alternatives.\n\nGreen will go down as an all-time great member Cincinnati Bengals, but it's time to move on and the Bengals organization should be happy to oblige.\n\nBrent Sobleski covers the NFL for Bleacher Report.
