The report comes as the capital looks set to see the murder rate surpass that of last year, which was already a decade-high level.\n\nAnalysis in May by the London Assembly\u2019s Conservatives claimed since Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan became mayor in 2016, the city has seen knife crime rise by 52 per cent. Mayor Khan has come under criticism for diverting funds on non-essential services, including spending \u00a31.7 million on an online hate crime hub and \u00a334 million on green projects.\n\nLast year, it was revealed that London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service is dropping investigations into minor, \u2018non-serious\u2019 crimes while a separate report revealed the force was abandoning around one-third of all crime reports after a single phone call without investigation.\n\nWhile the BBC\u2019s analysis revealed that London remains the most dangerous region for knife attacks, the rate of serious knife crime in other areas is outstripping some London boroughs. Those listed include Manchester, Slough, Liverpool, and Blackpool. Other non-London regions listed in the top-25 are Nottingham, Birmingham, and Oldham.\n\nKhan's London: Average of 40 Knife Crimes Every Day https://t.co/xl4qZOjJfq \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 7, 2019\n\nA number of reports have raised the increase in County Lines as a factor in growing knife crime. County Lines are drug-trafficking networks based in metropolitan areas where dealers groom teens into transporting and selling drugs to customers in the suburbs. While the young dealers often cross county boundaries, the crime network is named for the dedicated mobile phone \u201cdeal lines\u201d used to take orders from drug users.\n\nAshley Hackett, chief executive of Blackpool Football Club Community Trust, told the BBC: \u201cThere is a significant issue with county lines [drugs courier] gangs in Blackpool, and from that we are seeing that means a lot of young people are carrying knives.\u201d\n\nMedia reports that most of the lines originate in London, with The Guardian noting some London lines linked to high-profile cases stretch to as far as Wiltshire, Norwich, and even Wales. Other lines originate in cities like Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester.\n\nIn January, the National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed that County Lines in London had nearly tripled in one year, and was fueling the rise of crime in the capital.\n\nThe BBC report also revealed that knife crime has risen by 81 per cent across England and Wales since 2014, while prosecutions have fallen 20 per cent. Statistics from June showed that knife crime in England and Wales had risen to a nine-year high. The number of fatal stabbings has surged to its highest level since records began in 1946.\n\nSpeaking at the Conservative Party conference last week, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited the rise of County Lines drug gangs for rising crime in the United Kingdom, but also hit out at middle-class drug users who were fuelling their trade.", "description": "BBC analysis has revealed that London has 16 of the top 25 knife crime hot spots in England and Wales.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/GettyImages-122911308.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
