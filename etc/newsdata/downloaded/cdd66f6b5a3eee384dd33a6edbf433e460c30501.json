I can remember the light glinting off the blade. All I could see was his eyes.\n\n'He made threats for money and when I told him we only had one till with cash, and that there wasn't much in it, he got agitated and pushed the knife against my stomach.\n\n'I turned to go back to the office, to buy some time; I knew it was a case of fight or flight and I had a decision to make.\n\n'But the moment I turned my back I heard a loud crack; I didn't realise at the time but it was the sound of the police officer's taser going off.\n\n'One moment I was being threatened at knifepoint and the next the guy was on the floor and in handcuffs.\n\n'I thought \"wow\" where did you guys come from. It was like a miracle and perfect timing.\n\n'I'll always be grateful for what they did that night. They and their colleagues are welcome to pop in for a coffee on their break whenever they like!'\n\nDetective Inspector Kat Sibley said: 'The officers were patrolling shortly after midnight and had stopped on a 'refs' break. They were in exactly the right place at the right time.\n\n'Thankfully no-one was hurt and the man has rightly been handed a jail term for what was a nasty robbery.'", "description": "Heart-stopping CCTV shows Zachery Ryan, 41, burst into a Coventry McDonald's at midnight on August 7 before threatening the manager and pressing an eight-inch blade to his stomach.", "authors": ["James Wood For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/15/20182086-0-image-a-109_1572014291443.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
