Congress returns to Washington on Oct. 15 after a two-week recess.\n\nThe impeachment investigation could lead to the approval by the House of formal charges against Trump.\n\nA trial on whether to remove him from office would then be held in the Republican-controlled Senate, but few Republicans have broken ranks with Trump so far for asking Ukraine and China to launch investigations of Biden, a former vice president and a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 presidential election.\n\nSECOND WHISTLEBLOWER\n\nOn Sunday, lawyers said a second whistleblower had come forward to substantiate an August complaint from an unidentified U.S. intelligence official, which touched off the investigation.\n\nA bipartisan group of about 90 former national security officials on Sunday called on federal officials and media outlets to protect the initial whistleblower\u2019s identity, citing protections under the law, even as Trump has publicly sought for it to be revealed.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 4, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nDiplomatic text messages released by Democrats last week show that U.S. officials were involved in the effort to secure a public commitment from Ukraine to look into the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump has alleged that Hunter Biden profited in his business dealings in both Ukraine and China from his father\u2019s position, and that Joe Biden, as vice president, pushed Ukraine to fire a prosecutor to impede a probe of a company tied to his son.\n\nHowever, the prosecutor in question was widely regarded by Washington and its European allies as being too lax in his investigations. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden.\n\nSondland is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the three House committees leading the impeachment probe, and Yovanovitch is due to appear on Friday.", "description": "Congressional Democrats issued subpoenas to the Pentagon and the White House budget office on Monday as part of their impeachment inquiry, seeking documents related to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withhold military assistance from Ukraine.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191007&t=2&i=1438084212&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF960WJ", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
