But a new scam presents a fresh problem, a problem made worse by the robocall scourge.\n\nSince October 2013, IRS phone scams have cost around 14,700 people more than $72 million in wire transfers, gift cards, and prepaid debit cards. The standard operating procedure: threatening immediate arrest by law enforcement unless the person pays \u2014 and quickly.\n\nHistorically, IRS scams have been the most common phone tactic used by scammers. But in the first six months of 2019, scammers are favoring a new method which involves getting victims\u2019 Social Security information.\n\nAccording to FTC complaint data, as well as data from background check provider BeenVerified, Social Security scam reports have increased by 23 times in the first six months of the year.\n\nThis problem is new and growing. BeenVerified\u2019s data show that in 2018, Social Security scam calls made up only 1.5% of total spam call comments and IRS and tax scams made up 6.8%. But this year, Social Security shot up to 9.5% of complaints as IRS scams fell to 1.7%.\n\nFTC data bears this out as well. Over the past year and a half, FTC reports for Social Security scam calls have ballooned, with over 76,000 in a 12-month period, with losses coming to $19 million. This is worse than the worst year of IRS scams, which recorded $17 million in scams, according to the agency in 2016.\n\nIn April, the FTC said that $6.7 million in reported losses were recorded in the previous two months, with the scam hitting all age groups. Like the IRS scam, people pay in gift cards, but other forms like bitcoin and feeding cash into bitcoin ATMs have been another method in getting anonymous cash to scammers.\n\nThe tactics are somewhat similar to the IRS scam. Scammers often try to scare consumers into paying quickly using made-up lawsuits, quoting badge numbers and using official language.\n\nAn example complaint from the background check service: \u201cThis message is from the legal department of the Social Security Administration. My federal badge ID is SSA 456. The purpose of this call is regarding an enforcement action, which has been executed by the U.S. Treasury against your Social Security number.\u201d\n\nBeenVerified\u2019s data highlighted another tactic: luring consumers with prizes and free offers like cruises, hotels, gift cards, and iPhones.\n\n\n\n\n\nData from the FTC shows that Social Security phone scams have passed IRS scams. (FTC) More\n\nBeenVerified noted that the situation is probably much worse, given the data is self-reported. Only those who chose to report the calls are counted.\n\nThough only 3.4% of people who report a scam actually get scammed \u2014 most just call to say their Social Security number got stolen \u2014 it\u2019s pretty bad when it happens. The median amount of damages is $1,500, which is \u201cfour times higher than the median individual loss for all frauds,\u201d according to the FTC.\n\nThe data highlights the ongoing nature of the scam industry, which operates in a Darwinian atmosphere. As the climate changes \u2014 people become educated about scams \u2014 the tactics change and scammers concentrate on what works.\n\nStopping robocalls is a key step\n\nToday more people understand that the IRS won\u2019t ever call you and demand immediate payment (this is the same for the Social Security Administration, and SSNs do not get \u201csuspended\u201d. The agency has taken great pains to educate the public, and those steps appear to have worked, as the amount of grift has tapered off. But now with the focus turning to Social Security numbers, the need for a more comprehensive solution is higher.\n\nA key problem? Many of these scam calls begin with robocalls.\n\nThe anti-robocall provisions set up by phone companies are helping, and the implementation of STIR/SHAKEN, the authentication standard expected to combat robocalls and faking caller ID numbers should help.\n\nBut as data from telecom analytics firm Transaction Network Services (TNS) notes, the problem is far from over.\n\n\u201cThings aren\u2019t getting better,\u201d said Jim Tyrrell, senior director of product marketing at TNS. \u201cNuisance and high-risk calls are increasing [by] double-digits.\u201d\n\nFor Social Security scams the problem is even worse, because it goes after older people who depend on Social Security benefits for income, and according to new survey data from TNS, there\u2019s a vast demographic difference between the people who choose to take advantage of robocall blocking services offered by companies and those who don\u2019t.", "description": "Consumers know about the IRS phone scam.
