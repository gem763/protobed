She praised the former Trump campaign manager for his recent tantrum at a congressional hearing and set him up to insult House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff. But as Lewandowski continued slurring words and garbling his pronunciation, she couldn\u2019t let it go unremarked upon.\n\n\u201cCorey,\u201d Kennedy asked, \u201cdid you have a little Merlot with dinner?\u201d\n\nLewandowski denied it, but the host didn\u2019t let it go. \u201cYou sound a little slurry. You sound a little Biden-esque,\u201d she said. Lewandowski was unfazed. He continued talking, calling Kennedy \u201cKenley\u201d and referring to Ukraine\u2019s president as \u201cSalinsky\u201d (his last name is actually Zelensky). That\u2019s when Kennedy cut him off and suggested a \u201ccup of coffee.\u201d\n\nLast night on Fox Business, Corey Lewandowski looked so drunk that even the host asked him, \"did you have a little Merlot with dinner?\" pic.twitter.com/cvsBDztNUn \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) October 3, 2019\n\nLewandowski, who is reportedly under consideration for a White House role to help Trump fight off impeachment, is the latest ally of the president\u2019s to be accused of getting drunk before going on TV.\n\nBefore him, there was Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who\u2019s spent the past couple weeks putting together a reel of increasingly unhinged TV appearances that have led to some to question his on-air sobriety. On MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Mika Brzezinski wondered \u201cif there\u2019s inebriation here\u201d while discussing Giuliani\u2019s 28-minute shouting match with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo.\n\nBrzezinski\u2019s MSNBC colleague Elise Jordan also cracked wise about Giuliani after the CNN interview, in which Giuliani denied asking the Ukrainian government to investigate Hunter Biden seconds before he confessed to doing exactly that. \u201cIt is just simply astounding to watch drunk grandpa last night,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the MSNBC crowd wondering either. Sarah Longwell, publisher of the conservative website The Bulwark, wrote this week that the Trump administration should \u201c[s]top putting Rudy Giuliani on television.\u201d She continued:\n\nHe\u2019s drunk. Or maybe just addled? I don\u2019t know\u2014but it doesn\u2019t matter because he\u2019s going to get you all sent to prison by reading text messages from State Department officials out loud on Laura Ingraham\u2019s show. Go to the zoo. Find an adorable penguin. Put that little guy on instead.\n\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow has dealt with similar accusations over the past couple years. Last year, Kudlow slurred his way through attacks on Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on CNN, leading to accusations that he was drunk. It happened again last month, after Kudlow appeared on Fox News Sunday to deny that a recession is coming.\n\nDana talks with Larry Kudlow, White House Economic Adviser about a tax cut for the middle class \"There's a lot of good ideas to create more incentives to work, save and invest\" @larry_kudlow #FNS #FoxNews pic.twitter.com/PindlESTGL \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) August 18, 2019\n\nSometimes, Trump lackeys arouse suspicion with more than slurred speech. Sam Nunberg, who briefly served as an adviser on the Trump campaign in 2016, smelled of booze during a spot on CNN last year. At least that\u2019s what host Erin Burnett said. The interview came amid a media blitz that was widely labeled a meltdown and left Burnett sounding concerned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done six interviews in the the past four hours,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018Bizarre\u2019 was a word that some White House officials were using to describe some of your interviews. \u2018Nuts\u2019 is another one \u2026 I reached out to a Trump ally to ask what you think about Sam and essentially this person told me \u2026 \u2018You\u2019re drunk or off your meds.\u2019 At least half a dozen other CNN reporters have received similar messages.\u201d\n\nAfter nearly 30 more minutes of talking, Burnett said flatly, \u201cTalking to you, I have smelled alcohol on your breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not had a drink,\u201d Nunberg replied.\n\nErin Burnett to Sam Nunberg:\n\n\n\n\"I have smelled alcohol on your breath.\"pic.twitter.com/cledGLfXeV \u2014 JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) March 6, 2018", "description": "After a slurring his way through an interview, Corey Lewandowski left a Fox Business host wondering if he\u2019d had \u201ca little Merlot with dinner.\u201d Trump defenders Rudy Giuliani, Larry Kudlow, Sam Nunberg have also been accused of on-air drunkenness.", "authors": ["Adam K.
