Taking into account progressive promises, federal spending could rise to between $105 trillion to $149 trillion during the same time period \u2013 to as much as nearly 59 percent of GDP.\n\nSingle-payer health insurance, alone, would increase federal spending by around $32 trillion over the course of a decade, while free college could cost between $1 trillion to $2 trillion. Other programs taken into consideration were guaranteed jobs/universal basic income and the Green New Deal.\n\nTaking every dollar earned by people with incomes above $200,000 would not be enough to pay for the proposals that have been floated, the report found.\n\nA flat tax rate of 100 percent on those with incomes of $1 million or more would not even raise enough to eliminate the current federal deficit.\n\nNot all candidates, however, support each of the policies listed. Many of the 2020 candidates, for example, have different visions for reforming the health care system \u2013 with some offering a public buy-in option.\n\nDemocrats have drawn fire over plans to pay for their policies. Proposals have included raising taxes, largely targeting Wall Street (through financial transactions taxes) or the wealthy (through estate tax expansions or flat-out wealth taxes).\n\nIndependent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is one of the only candidates that has admitted that taxes on the middle class would have to rise in order to pay for his Medicare for All proposal \u2013 however, he noted that people would be saving more on health care expenditures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Progressive proposals could increase federal spending by as much as 161 percent, which can't be paid for by taxing the rich, study finds.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/02/0/0/Kamala-Harris-Cory-Booker-Bernie-Sanders-Elizabeth-Warren.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
