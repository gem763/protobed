It\u2019s an exchange of commitments,\u201d one that might open up space for a process among Afghans, hosted by another nation\u2014without the United States in the thick of it\u2026\n\nTrump had hoped to broker an Afghan peace before the Presidential campaign heats up\u2014to convince voters that he knows the art of diplomatic deals. Instead, it could become an election issue. \u201cThe whole thing doesn\u2019t quite make sense. It\u2019s just another example of the President treating foreign policy like it\u2019s some kind of game show,\u201d the Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic Presidential candidate, said on CNN. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a game show\u2014these are terrorists.\u201d\u2026\n\nBut a senior official, who worked on Afghanistan in both the George W. Bush and Obama Administrations, told me that the Administration has now bestowed credibility on the Taliban. \u201cInviting an armed insurgent group to Camp David when Afghanistan has an elected government that we\u2019ve supported for eighteen years, that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re basically legitimizing an armed insurgent group, which may be unprecedented.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Robin Wright", "Newyorker.Com News Our-Columnists Trumps-Stunt-With-The-Taliban-Was-Not-About-Negotiating-Peace"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
