That boasted a gradient of 106 per cent.", "description": "The futuristic Stoos Bahn climbs a 110% gradient between Schywz to the mountain village of Stoos in central Switzerland.", "authors": ["Katy Dartford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/03/32/06/1000x563_story-3b7d8ae0-740f-5e31-97f0-d111094cb93e_1111397.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-18"}
