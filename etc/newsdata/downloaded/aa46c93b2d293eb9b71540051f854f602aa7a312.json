When we went to check how many were in the cot, we noticed the sheets were filthy with excrement stains.'\n\nThe holidaymakers say they complained to reception who offered them another room with just two single beds.\n\nAlthough this wasn't suitable, the hotel said it was otherwise fully booked so the family had no choice but to sleep in the infested suite, they claim.\n\nShiyun's friend and two children were then taken out of the complex - because it was fully booked - two miles away to a villa.\n\nShe added: 'It was 4am and my baby boy was crying. I went to make him a bottle of milk but the kettle provided was so dirty and full of limescale.\n\n'It was completely unacceptable and from that moment, all I wanted to do was go home.'\n\nThe hotel manager allegedly came and tried to rid the ants by brushing them away and using vinegar soaked cloth but this disturbed the nest, causing hundreds more to come into the bedroom, Shiyun claims.\n\n'He then got a piece of tissue with jam on and placed it on the windowsill in an attempt to attract the ants outside.\n\n'This took well over an hour and our baby was unsettled and we were exhausted. At 5am we asked him to leave,' she adds.\n\nThere was a rubbish tip near the hotel which made the resort smell, according to the family\n\nAfter the two families were reunited the following morning and complained to the hotel again, they were offered new rooms which were 'small in size' and not resembling what they had booked online, they state.\n\nShiyun said: 'We decided to take a walk around the complex and it was not long before we noticed an overpowering smell which lingered everywhere.\n\n'As we walked around, there were rat traps everywhere and live rats scurrying around.\n\n'The ant problem went beyond the accommodation as there were ants around the dining areas and pool. It was unsafe for my baby to crawl or any of the children to play.\n\n'To our horror, right next to the entertainment area was a rubbish tip where there were animal carcasses and piles of rubbish everywhere.'\n\nWorse was to come at dinner time - Shiyun claims the hotel served raw food including meat and fruit such as melon had gone off.\n\nThings became worse when her partner started to suffer from sickness and diarrhoea. He was so violently sick that his blood vessels in his eye burst. Her friend and their children also suffered from upset stomachs, they claim.\n\nShiyun photographed what looked like an animal carcass in the grounds near the resort\n\nAllegedly, when they reported the under-cooked and inedible food, the restaurant manager just looked at them and went back to her office.\n\nShiyun claims: 'There was meant to be entertainment provided every night but this wasn't the case and when my eight year old daughter asked for a hot chocolate, the sugar pot was full of ants.\n\n'When we raised this with a member of staff, my daughter was told not to tell anyone.'\n\nThe hotel was also said to be lacking in basic amenities with the family only provided with one toilet roll between three and one towel each, meaning they had to ask for more.\n\nThey had to make their own beds and floors were left dirty as the cleaners never showed up, they families claim.\n\n'It didn't feel like we were on holiday and we certainly weren't enjoying ourselves.\n\n'When we asked for a cocktail, we were told they had insufficient staff to do this. The pool bar at the waterpark was never open and the waterpark itself was only open on certain days. At the time of booking, it said the waterpark would be open every day.\n\n'We had to report the shower in our room as the big glass panel was falling off and it was unsafe to use.'\n\nThis is how the resort is advertised online - with no sign of a sewage system or stray dogs\n\nAnother major issue was stray dogs. The hotel was apparently aware of them roaming around and they were known to be vicious, they claim.\n\nWith so many children at the hotel, Shiyun expected them to do something to make sure the dogs weren't able to enter the premises but they didn't care, according to Shiyun. There was dog faeces everywhere which was never cleaned up.\n\nThe family were at their wits' end and decided that they wanted to return home to the UK early. After researching flights they managed to fly home on day six of their 10 days holiday.\n\n'We tried really hard to make the most of the holiday but it was actually impossible.\n\n'Our children kept saying they wanted to go home, which they've never said on holiday before.\n\n'They were so disappointed and it was very upsetting as a parent to see them so sad on holiday when they were meant to be having the time of their lives.'\n\nShiyun added: 'I am disappointed that such a well-known company would allow us to holiday in such squalid conditions, especially with a ten month old baby.\n\n'They sold us a \u00a34,000, four star holiday which resembled that of not even a one star.'\n\nA spokesperson for On the Beach said: 'Our customer experience is of the highest importance and we take any complaints very seriously.\n\n'At the time that this holiday was taken, On the Beach acted as an agent and therefore sent the complaint directly to our supplier, in this case Jumbo Tours, providing our customer with the supplier's response.\n\n'As this has since become a legal matter, On the Beach is unable to provide any further comment at this stage.'\n\nThis is Money has contacted the hotel directly for comment.\n\nThe group made a compliant whilst still in Greece but nothing came from it and when they got home they wrote to On the Beach listing all the problems.\n\nShiyun claims: 'We got a response saying it was nothing to do with them as they are only the booking agent, despite all the evidence I have.\n\n'They [the hotel] laughed in my face when I said I'd see them in court, and even tried to intimidate me by saying it would cost me a lot of money and that I would be unlikely to win.'\n\nBelieving that On the Beach did not take their complaints seriously, Shiyun and her family decided to take legal action with solicitors, Bott and Co.\n\nDavid Bott, senior partner at Bott and Co, said: 'This group were let down by On the Beach and were led to believe that this hotel would resemble that of a four star establishment but this was not the case when they arrived and the resort looked nothing like the photographs online.\n\n'They suffered a great deal of stress and upset, including becoming unwell. There were not the adequate amenities in place for a baby and there were many safety risks on site for both adults and children.\n\n'This online travel retailer had a responsibility to make sure this family were not sold a holiday which in reality didn't depict what they saw at the time of booking. They were forced to pay extra to leave early and we're going to do everything we can to get them compensation.'\n\nIt wasn't just Shiyun and her family who have reported issues at the resort, however. Numerous other guests have taken to Tripadvisor to express their disappointment.\n\nThe Gelina resort only has an average of three stars out of five on the site, despite its four star rating.\n\nThis guest advised people not to go to the rest after saying the 'quality of the room is horrible'\n\nAnother guest gave the hotel just one stars out of five saying it is 'of a very poor standard'\n\nOne star: One reviewer on Tripadvisor said it was the worst holiday she had ever been on\n\nThis is Money previously reported on the case of a family of eight who also resorted to legal action after their holiday with Tui turned into a nightmare.", "description": "Upon arrival the family were shocked to find the resort had a strong smell of sewage radiating from the nearby tip, swarms of ants in their bedroom, rat traps in every corner and unclean sheets.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
