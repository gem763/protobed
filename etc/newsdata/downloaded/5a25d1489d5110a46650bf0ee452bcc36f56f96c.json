On at least three occasions, the office of New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham provided him with buses to take people out of Texas. Garcia\u2019s unofficial jurisdiction included not just Deming and El Paso, but also Dallas in Texas; Lordsburg, Mesilla, Chaparral, Anthony, and Albuquerque in New Mexico; and, occasionally, even Denver, Colorado. As the liaison handling arrangements among dozens of shelter spaces, cities, counties, and federal agencies, he was the only one who knew how much bed space was available on a given night.\n\n\n\nAs we were talking, a group of 60 adults and children entered the cafeteria of the Casa Oscar Romero and sat at the long table, unfolding the chairs resting against the walls. In the kitchen, volunteers dished piles of fried chicken into large metal bowls. The building also had rooms with beds, blankets, and toys; on the walls were instructions for how to read plane and bus itineraries. A map featuring all of Greyhound\u2019s routes across the country was posted near the entrance, where a boy squirmed on a bench.\n\n\u201cWelcome! I bet you\u2019re all tired of riding on buses,\u201d Garcia bellowed in Spanish, as the families filtered into the cafeteria.\n\n\u201cYes, very tired,\u201d one woman offered.\n\n\u201cWell, good, the bus ride is over.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was almost as if they were causing chaos.\u201d\n\nAs people lined up to receive plates of chicken and biscuits, Garcia showed me a receipt for the food totaling more than $500. In all, Annunciation House has paid roughly a million dollars this year on hotel room accommodations alone for asylum-seekers, Garcia said. A full accounting is difficult to make, since the effort is spread out among so many towns and cities, stretching all the way from Texas to California. In July, as part of a $4.5 billion package ostensibly to improve detention conditions at Border Patrol and ICE facilities along the border, Congress budgeted $30 million to reimburse governments and nonprofit organizations that had spent resources on the improvised resettlement effort. But to qualify for this support, they would have to apply to FEMA for the funds, which would be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. The amount will almost surely fall short.\n\nFurthermore, the heavily bureaucratic method to apply for the funds, which requires applicants to submit estimates through layers of bureaucracy within FEMA\u2019s Emergency Food & Shelter Program, disadvantages the countless smaller churches, ministries, and community groups that burned through money and resources assisting tens of thousands of asylum-seekers, sometimes without keeping careful records. Reimbursement requests submitted by larger nonprofits, such as Catholic Charities and United Way, are more likely to be successful because they are represented on the national FEMA board that decides which applications to greenlight.\n\nFor their part, Garcia said Annunciation House would not apply for reimbursement, in order to avoid the taint of association with the federal government. But Garcia said he would welcome federal assistance, should the city receive it, with the major expense of transportation, which Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration appears to authorize.\n\nVolunteers with Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley facilitate the arrival of asylum-seekers to a respite center in McAllen, Texas, on March 23. Aaron Cant\u00fa\n\n\u201cIf the military is to be used to assist Border Patrol with the influx of arriving refugees,\u201d Garcia later said in a press release, \u201cthen the military\u2019s transportation capabilities should be used to transport refugees to faith communities in larger cities who can receive and assist refugee families.\u201d\n\nA nearly 800-mile drive from El Paso, in the town of McAllen, Texas, Sister Norma Pimentel has been at the forefront of migrant family arrivals since 2014. Pimentel oversees the ever-relocating Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley respite center in this town, where asylum-seekers are transported after their release from detention at Border Patrol facilities. Before this year, the number of people arriving at her door ranged from less than a dozen a day, to so many that they had to take refuge in large emergency tents propped up behind a church in the city\u2019s downtown district.\n\nNothing, however, prepared Pimentel for the overwhelming number of people released by Border Patrol this year. Previously, according to The Monitor, the high water mark for Catholic Charities in McAllen was October 2016, when the nonprofit cared for 5,600 people. That number nearly doubled to 10,645 in March of this year, including a single day that month in which the center accommodated more than 1,300 people\u2014an unprecedented number for a 24-hour period, in a space designed to hold just a few hundred.\n\nDuring a visit in March to the building, I saw lines of people spilling out the front door, waiting to receive clothing for children and infants. Nurses were checking people who seemed sick, and a volunteer helped families make travel plans. There was a sense of ordered chaos; volunteers wearing teal vests raced around the facility, speaking with migrants, and ordering food.\n\nThe week before, Border Patrol had given Pimentel only three days\u2019 notice that it was going to release thousands of people per day into McAllen, Brownsville, Harlingen, and other cities across the Rio Grande Valley for the foreseeable future\u2014a pace that didn\u2019t start to dissipate until the summer. Previously, Border Patrol agents would inform Pimentel well ahead of time that they were transporting families directly to Catholic Charities in McAllen, including how many and when. But now, as in El Paso and elsewhere in the Rio Grande Valley, border agents were dropping off migrants directly at bus stations instead of at local organizations like the Catholic Charities building. It was a change that confused Pimentel.\n\n\u201cMy surprise mostly has been the fact that they started distributing them throughout the whole [Rio Grande Valley],\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, why are you dropping them off at the bus stations, when you have always brought them to us? Why change that? For me, it was a big question mark. Like, why would they want to do that? It was almost as if they were causing chaos.\u201d\n\nIn March, in the city of Brownsville at the very southernmost tip of Texas, city officials and volunteers were also left questioning the motives of Border Patrol agents after they dropped off about 50 asylum-seekers on a street corner in the city\u2019s historic downtown district\u2014half a mile from a Greyhound bus station. On that day, there were only a handful of volunteers at the Good Neighbor Settlement House, an old two-story building in a low-income neighborhood that provides a food pantry and bed space to migrants as well as the local homeless and poor.\n\nAlso, none of the people dropped off by Border Patrol had any of their official documents, which would have allowed them to travel within the United States\u2014another unprecedented development. When Good Neighbor\u2019s director was alerted of this situation, she led them inside the settlement house, where the group was kept separate from asylum-seekers who did have paperwork. Of the nearly 250 people accommodated that day, half were small children.\n\nHe suspected the agency was purposely creating an unmanageable situation to turn the Trump\u2019s rhetoric about a crisis at the border into a reality.\n\n\u201cBorder Patrol dropped off two busloads of people, no documents, [meaning] we can\u2019t even lend them a phone to make arrangements; they\u2019ll just get detained again while traveling,\u201d Belinda Bradford, a full time employee at Good Neighbor, told me. Two hours later, she recalled, \u201cBorder Patrol comes with a box, and says, \u2018Oh, we forgot to give them their paperwork.\u2019 Really?\u201d She sighed. \u201cMaybe they thought they could get away with it?\u201d\n\nIt turned out that Border Patrol agents only brought the paperwork after they were contacted by Tony Martinez, then the mayor of Brownsville. Martinez told me that he suspected the agency was purposely creating an unmanageable situation to turn the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric about a crisis at the border into a reality. \u201cThere seems to have been an assumption that we couldn\u2019t handle it, an expectation that we\u2019re unable to manage\u201d the mass release of asylum-seekers, Martinez said. \u201cBut I\u2019m a problem solver, and if you give me a problem, I\u2019ll give you your pick of solutions.\u201d\n\nRonald Vitiello, former acting chief of the Border Patrol under President Obama and acting director for ICE until he was ousted by Trump in April, claims that post-release planning was simply not his job. Neither \u201cCBP nor ICE are appropriated [by Congress] for this after care, we [did] it because it\u2019s a best practice and because it makes sense and helps communities and our relationships with these towns, but nobody in the government is funded for that,\u201d he said in a phone conversation. \u201cThese mayors and the cities, they came to expect a service brought to them by the government, they got used to it, [and] when the numbers overwhelmed everybody, they looked to us to fix it.\u201d\n\n\n\nA preview of the federal government\u2019s new position toward released asylum-seekers came last October, when officials with the Department of Homeland Security informed humanitarian groups in San Diego that agents would no longer help with post-release planning. The policy was clarified on March 27, when then-CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said that CBP and ICE would begin releasing asylum-seekers en masse into border towns. In front of the bollard border fence and near the Paso del Norte International Bridge in El Paso, where migrants were being held behind razor wire, McAleenan, now the acting secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, painted a grave picture of CBP facilities bursting with human beings, a situation he called unprecedented. The mass releases were being done with reluctance, he said.\n\n\u201cIt represents an increase in flows that will follow,\u201d McAleenan said. \u201cThat is not something we want to do, it is something we have to do given the overcrowding in our facilities.\u201d\n\nBy that point, mass drop-offs of migrant families had already been occurring for a few weeks in El Paso, as well as sporadically in late 2018. On March 15, the city\u2019s fire chief, Mario D\u2019Agostino, emailed ICE official Marc Moore pleading with the agency not to release additional migrants into the city because shelters were at capacity. That request was ignored, and 147 people were dropped off at El Paso\u2019s downtown bus station four days later\u2014prompting the local office of emergency personnel to dispatch employees who then assisted migrants with purchasing tickets. The city regularly uses its own resources in such situations, deploying their own EMT staffs, for example, to screen migrants who have often been held in crammed and fetid conditions, with critically deficient access to hygiene products, sleeping space, and nutrition, leaving many in precarious health after an often harrowing journey.\n\nA total of 35,000 of these asylum-seekers passed through a network of hospitality centers in El Paso, Las Cruces, and Albuquerque between December and March, according to D\u2019Agostino. The direct releases were so overwhelming that Rep. Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, in a March 1 letter begged McAleenan \u201cto alleviate some of the local burden that falls on my community.\u201d\n\nThough agents are supposed to detain migrants for no more than 72 hours, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general observed that 3,400 of 8,000 detainees at several different Border Patrol stations in the Rio Grande Valley during early June had been held for longer, with many stays longer than 10 days. In April, a government inspector visited a station in Clint, Texas, near El Paso, and found hungry children and adults living in lice-infested cells for weeks on end, sometimes being taken to a quarantine cell if they contracted scabies, chickenpox, or other diseases.\n\nThe fact that Border Patrol has exerted wide discretion over who it detains, and for how long, made some immigration attorneys wonder whether agency leaders were timing the release of migrants for maximum impact. Back in the Rio Grande Valley, for example, The Monitor reported that asylum-seekers were being held in Border Patrol custody for as long as ten days\u2014even as the agency publicly claimed facilities were at \u201ccritical capacity\u201d and unable to handle the increased numbers of new arrivals. The prolonged detentions didn\u2019t make any sense, argued attorney Karla Vargas of the Texas Civil Rights Project, for an agency trying to clear bed space as quickly as possible. She sees this as a sign that the agency may have chosen to do mass public releases for cynical reasons.\n\n\u201cWhy are these empty, if we have this chaos happening at the [CBP] processing centers?\u201d Vargas said. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of the narrative that the administration is trying to put forth that CBP is being overrun by immigrants, and therefore they need more money, when in reality it\u2019s the way they\u2019re mismanaging people and focused on stockpiling people in these processing centers instead of getting them to the next phase of the immigration process.\u201d\n\nVolunteers at the Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, prepare trays of food for asylum-seekers on April 8. Aaron Cant\u00fa\n\nGarcia, the director of Annunciation House in El Paso, also suspected a \u201cpolitical dimension\u201d to the timing of the chaotic mass releases. \u201cI think it goes beyond negligence, I really do,\u201d Garcia said, \u201cEspecially when you start talking about the treatment of human beings.\u201d\n\nThe first locality to challenge the Trump administration\u2019s decision to end its Safe Release policy was San Diego County, which voted in April to sue the current and former heads of ICE, CBP, and Border Patrol for what it called a \u201csudden and unlawful change in policy.\u201d The complaint alleged that the policy shift meant that border agents were now releasing asylum seekers from federal detention without \u201cthe previously-provided assistance in reaching their final destination(s) outside the County.\u201d The suit seeks a reinstatement of that assistance and reimbursement for the resources San Diego has devoted to caring for asylum-seekers.\n\nThat assistance, the San Diego lawsuit said, had long included helping asylum seekers locate contact information for relatives residing in the U.S. and facilitating phone calls between asylum seekers and those relatives. ICE would then transport people to points of departure, such as bus stations, train stations, and airports, and even offer food for the journey. It remains unclear, according to the complaint, why this policy was ended; it came to an abrupt halt, without explanation, last year.\n\nThe San Diego suit caught the attention of officials in New Mexico and West Texas. Albuquerque eventually filed a joint lawsuit with the state of New Mexico, citing duress similar to that claimed by San Diego County\u2014and the newer suit goes into far more detail about the state resources deployed to pick up the federal government\u2019s slack. It alleges that the New Mexico office of the attorney general, as well as the state\u2019s youth and family services department and office of emergency management, spent resources investigating reports of human trafficking, while workers for the state labor and transportation departments were directed to coordinate travel plans for asylum seekers. In addition, according to the complaint, state police were on alert in communities receiving large numbers of people, and the state sent $750,000 in emergency grants to the cities of Deming and Las Cruces and Luna County to manage migrants rapidly being released from federal custody.\n\n\n\nThere were other public safety consequences, well beyond the scope of the lawsuits. With the number of families crossing the border on the rise in April, a far-right militia group made national headlines after its gun-toting members filmed themselves briefly detaining hundreds of migrants along the border, a few dozen miles south of Las Cruces. On April 15, just three days after Border Patrol began dropping off asylum-seekers there, one extremist called the city threatening to take action \u201cif necessary.\u201d A few months later, somebody called in a death threat to the mayor\u2019s office, requiring the police department to assign several cops to trail the mayor at a city council meeting.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to see how every town or nonprofit organization that contributed to the relief effort will be fully compensated by the federal government.\n\nIn an interview, Mayor Ken Miyagishima blamed the president\u2019s rhetoric for the elevated threats. \u201cThey hear the top elected official in the U.S. making [anti-immigrant] comments, and it just lends itself to the animosity among friends, neighbors, relatives,\u201d Miyagishima said.\n\nLas Cruces accommodated 16,750 refugees since April, according to its own count, and still received about 150 daily until recently. After rushing to supply transportation between local hospitality centers, bus stations, and airports, the city agreed to put up $500,000 toward city worker overtime pay, partial reimbursement for local non-profits providing refugee hospitality services, and rent for an old armory near downtown that now acts as an unofficial central processing center. The money came from a special fund the city generates by leasing out a hospital building.\n\n\u201cVery few cities have this fund like I\u2019m describing to you,\u201d Miyagishima said. \u201cAnd if you stop and think about it, what about all the savings that the federal government is saving right now? Normally it\u2019d be a federal employee doing a lot of this work, and we have volunteers doing it.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s interim manager, William Studer, the city was planning to submit a list of expenses to FEMA\u2019s Emergency Food and Shelter National Board Program in late July, and was hopeful that funds would be disbursed within 60 days of approval. FEMA is supposed to reimburse funds already spent as well as supplement future expenditures through September 2020, covering such items as food, lodging in shelters or hotels, transportation costs, and basic necessities like hygiene products and diapers. Las Cruces expects to spend $90,000 per week for the next year. Together with the half million in reimbursement it\u2019s already seeking, that will put its total request at $5.5 million.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just one town.\n\nWith only $30 million budgeted by Congress, it\u2019s difficult to see how every town or nonprofit organization that contributed to the relief effort will be fully compensated by the federal government. The costs to Annunciation House and the city of McAllen each reached at least $1 million, while the state of New Mexico and the city of Albuquerque claimed total expenses of $1 million. Among Las Cruces, McAllen, and the state of New Mexico, that\u2019s already approaching a third of the budgeted funds. Yet nearly two dozen other cities likely expended far more than usual on caring for asylum-seekers, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Berkeley, Dallas, Denver, Austin, Phoenix, and Tucson, and a smattering of smaller towns in all four border states.\n\nAlthough charities can request funds, it\u2019s hard to imagine the smaller ones successfully navigating a bureaucratic process that hasn\u2019t been widely publicized.\n\nOn a Tuesday evening in early June, I checked in with one of these charities: Mustard Seed & Rainbow Ministries, a tiny church located in Chaparral, New Mexico, a community some 30 miles southeast of Las Cruces. The setting sun cast orange and purple hues over the red earth. Inside, rows of mustard-colored pews filled the main hall, while smaller rooms were stuffed with cots, piles of dirty laundry, and boxes of clean donated clothing and hygiene supplies.\n\nSince February, the church had been taking in about 60 asylum-seekers at a time from nearby El Paso. By the time of my visit, their last group had numbered around 25. While Pastors Joe and Iliana San Nicholas said they found their work spiritually rewarding\u2014the church\u2019s Facebook page features videos of asylum-seekers singing Christian songs\u2014they were both clearly exhausted. During the weeks when migrants stayed with them, they sometimes had to stay awake until four in the morning waiting with them at the bus station\u2014only to then have to transport another group to the airport a few hours later.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been rough,\u201d Iliana said. \u201cBut I understand, as a Christian and as a pastor, that when you start tapping into the kingdom of God and what God expects us to do, [helping refugees] is one of them, because God loves the immigrants.\u201d\n\nA box of donated toothpaste is kept at the Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, for distribution to asylum-seekers before they leave the facility. Aaron Cant\u00fa\n\nFor weeks, Iliana had tried asking the city of Las Cruces for financial help. Officials gave her the run-around, she said, and in the end told her that the funds it was sending to nonprofit organizations were only for those based in the city proper. The couple estimates they\u2019ve spent more than $10,000 of their own money on the effort, handing out cash to families and purchasing backpacks, clothes, food, soap, toothpaste, and gasoline. They\u2019ve barely scraped by. The church\u2019s small septic system wasn\u2019t able to handle the volume of people using the facilities, and had to be replaced at a cost of $3,700\u2014a discount, Iliana said, offered by a plumber connected with the church. When asked in early August if she planned to apply for FEMA funds, Iliana said it was the first time she\u2019d heard it was possible.\n\nAt the bus station in March in downtown McAllen, the city\u2019s old, clustered core, about two dozen asylum-seekers waited to buy bus tickets, clutching manila envelopes containing documents from CBP and ICE. Their intended destinations were written on the front of the envelopes. It has been a familiar sight since 2014, but a near constant one this past March.\n\nOne of these asylum-seekers was Suyapa, from a small fishing village near the capital of Honduras. She and her family had made their living by fishing, but said that gangs demanding bribes to operate their boat made the business impossible. So she fled with her daughter, who sat nearby blowing on a noisemaker as the pair waited to board a bus to Dallas.\n\nIn Honduras, Suyapa said, her eyes misting with tears, \u201cI couldn\u2019t work anymore, I couldn\u2019t bring home bread for my children.\u201d After walking to the border for three months, she was held at a Border Patrol processing facility in McAllen known among migrants as the perrera\u2014the dog kennel\u2014for its cage-like cells. Then Border Patrol took her and her daughter to the city\u2019s Catholic Charities respite center, where she received fresh clothing and volunteers ordered pizza for her cohort. She planned to stay with a friend until her asylum hearing; in the meantime, she will have to periodically check in with an ICE officer by phone.\n\nAmericans, she said, \u201cneed to understand that if we come here, it\u2019s out of necessity, because we\u2019d rather live back home. Life there, the gangs make it so difficult.\u201d\n\nSuyapa was arguably one of the lucky ones, arriving in the U.S. before the federal government expanded its Remain in Mexico program, which requires most Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their day in an American court. Since its implementation, the number of asylum-seekers arriving to humanitarian centers in McAllen, Brownsville, and El Paso have significantly fallen, from hundreds to as little as a dozen or fewer a day. Piloted in San Diego and then El Paso, the program was expanded by the Trump administration in an arrangement with Mexico across the entire border beginning in June, with Mexico expecting to receive as many as 60,000 asylum-seekers to Mexican border cities, where the threat of violence and kidnapping is so severe and access to lawyers so difficult many have given up on their asylum claims. Recently, Mexican authorities in some cities have transported asylum-seekers deeper into the country, as far as Monterrey, in northeast Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and even Chiapas, on the border with Guatemala. The policy and others are apparently meant to block asylum-seekers, as one National Security Council official admitted in an internal email. The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the policy.\n\nOn the diplomatic front, the Trump administration in late July strong-armed the Guatemalan government\u2014the top sending country for families this year\u2014into accepting a \u201csafe third country agreement\u201d in which migrants who passed through Guatemala would be required to first seek asylum there. The national asylum agency in Guatemala employs less than 10 people; the move appears to be yet another impossible barrier meant to discourage people from requesting asylum in the U.S.\n\nFor Ruben Garcia in El Paso, the federal government\u2019s callous position on asylum is a moral crisis of historic proportions. At the Annunciation House in early June, while he was still regularly assisting upwards of 500 asylum seekers a day, he compared the responsibility of caring for and housing refugees with past tests of the nation\u2019s character, including the Civil War. This is one of those moments, he said, when the country defines itself. \u201cWhen we say, \u2018All men are created equal\u2019 in 2019, it has to include migrants and refugees,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very inconvenient to have tens of thousands of refugees arriving. It\u2019s very inconvenient. It\u2019s a lot of work. But it\u2019s eminently possible,\u201d he said. \u201cThat hard work is what makes us who we are. That\u2019s where our pride comes from. Let\u2019s be busy with that.\u201d\n\nThis article was reported in partnership with Type Investigations.", "description": "Thousands of asylum-seekers were released into towns and cities near the border, straining local resources.
