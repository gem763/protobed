The opposition has arrived at an inopportune time for the president: The administration is weathering a heated battle with Congress, and according to a Fox News poll, more than half of voters now support the president\u2019s impeachment.\n\nTony Perkins, who leads the Family Research Council, is calling on the administration to actively demonstrate its support for persecuted religious minorities in the aftermath of the withdrawal. \u201cThis is inconsistent with what the president has done,\u201d he said.\n\nErick Erickson, a well-known conservative evangelical blogger, wrote on Twitter that Trump had committed \u201can egregious act of betrayal\u201d to the Kurds. \u201cShame on him,\u201d he said.\n\nPat Robertson, founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network, said he was \u201cappalled\u201d by the president\u2019s decision, and added that \u201cthe president of the United States is in great danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who rarely breaks with the president, said it could be \u201cthe biggest mistake of his presidency.\u201d\n\nCurrent disappointment is unlikely to translate into substantial or lasting opposition. And not all evangelical supporters have taken issue with Trump\u2019s decision. Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Dallas and a prominent supporter of Trump, said he \u201chappily\u201d deferred to the commander-in-chief, and he praised Trump for carrying through on a campaign promise to end U.S. involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts.\n\n\u201cSome evangelicals may disagree with the president\u2019s decision,\u201d Jeffress said, \u201cbut I guarantee you there is not one evangelical supporter of the president who would switch their vote and support Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden over a Syria decision.\u201d\n\nFranklin Graham stopped short of condemning Trump\u2019s policy outright. The evangelist said he communicated with the president or vice president \u2014 he would not specify which leader \u2014 about the troop withdrawal within the last 48 hours, and said he ultimately deferred to their determinations. He declined to give specifics of his conversation.\n\n\u201cThere are so many other issues at stake here,\u201d he said, listing things such as Turkey\u2019s membership in NATO and U.S. military bases in the country. \u201cIt is a very hard decision.\u201d\n\nPerkins pointed to the administration\u2019s other efforts for religious freedom, and said that \u201cone incident doesn\u2019t make an administration.\u201d\n\nReligious freedom, like anti-abortion policy and conservative judges, has often been a point of pride for many of Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nAt the United Nations last month, Trump earned praise from supporters for highlighting religious freedom instead of prioritizing a major climate summit. As Trump\u2019s call with the president of Ukraine roiled Washington last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, an evangelical who often weaves together Christianity and foreign policy, spoke on religious freedom in Rome.\n\nThis summer, around the time of the Mueller hearings on Capitol Hill, the State Department convened a celebrated gathering to advance global religious freedom.", "description": "One called President Donald Trump's decision \"an egregious act of betrayal.\" Another said the policy could be \"the biggest mistake of his presidency.\" A third said Trump \"is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven.\"Conservative Christians have ardently stood by Trump", "authors": ["Elizabeth Dias"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
