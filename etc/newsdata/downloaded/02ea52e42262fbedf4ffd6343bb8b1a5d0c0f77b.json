(AP) - Holy Name senior Andrew Debs was just 4 years old when his father, John, passed away in 2006. Andrew has some memories of his dad and he smiles when he recalls excitedly waking up his dad early on Saturday mornings. Andrew has heard stories and seen photos of his father, like the portrait of him holding Andrew and his older brother, Zachary, and the 1982 UMass football team picture. John, a star linebacker on that squad, is in the third row.\n\nAndrew, a Naps wide receiver who has caught seven touchdown passes this fall, believes he inherited his love of football from his father, who played for coach Rich Lewis at Wachusett Regional and went on to help UMass to the 1982 Yankee Conference championship.\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cOne of my biggest reasons for playing football, for playing as hard as I do, for working as hard as I do (is my dad). That\u2019s what I think about before every game and every practice to motivate myself.\u201d\n\nJohn was 46 when he passed away. As a result of chronic knee and other football injuries, John, over time, developed a dependency issue, his brother Stephen said.\n\nAndrew wears uniform No. 41, the same number his father wore at UMass.\n\n\u201cThe number is a huge part of it,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cKnowing I\u2019m wearing that number for him, it\u2019s like, \u2018All right, I\u2019ve got to go out there and play hard for him.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAfter a practice last week, Andrew, who is also a defensive back, sat in Holy Name athletics director Jim Manzello\u2019s office wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Around Andrew\u2019s neck was a gold chain with a guardian angel pendant. It was gift from his brother when their mother, Christina, passed away in 2018. Christina had given Zachary a similar pendant.\n\n\u201cI wear it every day,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cI never take it off.\u201d\n\nChristina, who was 42 when she died, also battled dependency.\n\n\u201cA day doesn\u2019t go by when I don\u2019t think about my mom or my dad,\u201d Andrew said.\n\nTwo years ago, Stephen Debs became guardian to Andrew and Zachary. The boys grew up in Worcester, attended Flagg Street School and Forest Grove Middle School and played football for the Worcester Cowboys, before moving to Paxton to live with their uncle and grandmother, Jean Debs.\n\n\u201cTheir parents aren\u2019t here,\u201d said Stephen, who is clearly devoted to his nephews, \u201cbut we try to make their childhood as happy as we can under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nChristina\u2019s passing, near the end of Andrew\u2019s sophomore year of high school, was obviously very difficult for him.\n\n\u201cIt was like going through it all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just another motivation. Every time I play, I\u2019m thinking of both my parents, about my brother, my uncle and the rest of my family.\u201d\n\nStephen is a real estate attorney in Worcester. He and John, who was also a lawyer, were previously in practice together.\n\nStephen said John, who was the second oldest of five Debs brothers, was the leader of their family, especially after their own father died in 1984.\n\n\u201cThe things John taught me,\u201d Stephen said, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to pass along to Andrew. Andrew is just like his dad; he reminds me so much of him. It makes me happy to be around him. He\u2019s a tremendous kid. When I see him score a touchdown, I wish John could have been there to witness it. He would have loved it.\u201d\n\nAndrew, a team captain, has helped the Naps, who won just two games each of the last two years, to a turnaround season. After a 16-12 loss to Worcester Tech on Saturday, Holy Name is 4-3.\n\nEarlier this season, Andrew helped the Naps to a come-from-behind win over South by catching two touchdown passes from senior quarterback Brett Pullman. In last week\u2019s victory over North, Andrew had a 29-yard touchdown reception and a key block that helped spring sophomore Issiah Agnew-Beatty free for a 50-yard TD run.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a block,\u201d Holy Name coach Jim Romeo said. \u201cIt was a block. You heard it.\u201d\n\nWhat stands out to Romeo about the 5-foot-8, 160-pound Andrew is his strength and work ethic, the extra time he put in with Pullman on Worcester State\u2019s Coughlin Field over the summer, his hours in the weight room or 30 minutes of jump roping he\u2019ll sneak in before doing his homework.\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes to make the team better,\u201d Romeo said. \u201cFor Andrew, it\u2019s always team first. I think that\u2019s what makes a good leader.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always learning, he always growing,\u201d Romeo said. \u201cI think he has wonderful resources around him that want to see him succeed.\u201d\n\nStephen, who played football at Doherty High, watched all of Andrew\u2019s games when he was a kid, introduced him to weight training when he got older and continues to be his No. 1 fan.\n\n\u201cSteve has played a big role in my life,\u201d Andrew said. \u201cMy uncle and my grandmother, they push me every day to be who I am, to go to school and get good grades. They hold me to a really high standard.\u201d\n\nZachary, who is two years older and an aspiring photographer, also looks out for Andrew. They were Naps teammates for one season.\n\nOn the field and in the hallways and classrooms of Holy Name, Andrew is known, simply, as a great kid.\n\n\u201cHe brings leadership, he brings character, he brings faith, he brings discipline, he brings maturity,\u201d Holy Name principal Edward Reynolds said. \u201cHe always has a smile on his face, he is always purposeful, he is always doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nAndrew said his grades are up this year. He likes math and may consider studying business. He would like to play football in college. He said Bryant, Saint Anselm and Stonehill are some of the schools on his radar.\n\nRomeo believes Andrew\u2019s work ethic can take him to the next level.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s faced more adversity than most,\u201d Romeo said, \u201cso therefore no challenge should be unsurpassable for him.\u201d\n\nOnline: https://bit.ly/2Ppm5ta\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Telegram & Gazette (Worcester, Mass.), http://www.telegram.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Holy Name senior Andrew Debs was just 4 years old when his father, John, passed away in 2006.
