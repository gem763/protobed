They said no matter who replaces Dombrowski, Alex Cora will return for a third season as manager.\n\nBoston has had baseball\u2019s highest payroll for two straight seasons and is on track to pay a $13 million luxury tax this year on a payroll of $243 million for purposes of the competitive balance tax, as it is formally known. That is $37 million over the tax threshold.\n\nNext year\u2019s threshold goes up to $208 million, and the Red Sox will be helped by the departure from the payroll of $56.82 million invested in five players: Rick Porcello ($20,625,000), Pablo Sandoval ($18,445,000), Mitch Moreland ($6.5 million), Steve Pearce ($6,250,000) and Eduardo N\u00fa\u00f1ez ($5 million).\n\nIf the Red Sox exceed the threshold for a third straight season in 2020, their base tax rate would rise from 30% to 50% and they would face surcharges that would raise he rate to 62% at $228 million and 95% at $248 million.\n\n\u201cWe need to be under the CBT,\u201d said Henry, the team\u2019s controlling owner. That was something we\u2019ve known for more than a year now.\u201d\n\nDombrowski was hired in August 2015 as the Red Sox skidded to their second straight last-place finish, and he led the team to three straight AL East titles and the 2018 World Series championship. Boston started this year 2-8 and began the season\u2019s final weekend in third place at 83-76.\n\nHenry said it was clear to him in conversations with Dombrowski in the days after the World Series win over the Los Angeles Dodgers that \u201cwe weren\u2019t going to be on the same wavelength going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hopeful throughout the year that maybe that perception would change. It didn\u2019t,\u201d Henry said.\n\nHenry said Boston plans to look outside its organization for its next baseball operations head, a person with a proven record. The person hired will have to deal with a payroll crunch that includes finding room for raises for Mookie Betts from $20 million and Jackie Bradley Jr. from $8.55 million.\n\nBoth are eligible for free agency after the 2020 World Series.\n\nWerner said he and team president Sam Kennedy spoke with Betts\u2019 agents as recently as a few weeks ago and that neither Betts nor his representatives gave any indication he wouldn\u2019t be at least interested in remaining with the club beyond 2020.\n\n\u201cWe think he\u2019s one of the great players in baseball,\u201d Werner said. \u201cHopefully there\u2019s a meeting of the minds going forward.\u201d\n\nEven with the poor results this year, the Red Sox have won four World Series titles under Werner and Henry, whose group bought the team in 2002.\n\n\u201cOur real intention is to be competitive every year,\u201d Werner said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll do whatever we have to do to do that. The solution to that isn\u2019t always having the highest payroll in baseball.\u201d\n\nWerner said the Red Sox won\u2019t feel rushed to get a successor in place.\n\n\u201cIn the end we take full responsibility for the overall direction of the club,\u201d Werner said. \u201cBut one of the things that we\u2019ve talked about and I think is apparent is that we need to have more depth in our minor league system.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Red Sox owners John Henry and Tom Werner intend to slash payroll to get under the luxury tax threshold next season, saying they fired Dave Dombrowski because of differing opinions on how to build for the future.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kyle Hightower"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
