Gen Z is thinking bigger", "language": "en", "text": "Recycle. Plant a tree. Turn the lights out.\n\nWhen the book \"50 Simple Things Kids Can Do To Save The Earth\" published in 1990, children were taught small ways to have a positive environmental impact and offset others' negative impacts.\n\nSelling more than 1 million copies with over half a million in its first year, it became a staple in classrooms and kicked off conversations around how to practice sustainability every day.\n\nToday, many kids are thinking a bit bigger.\n\nSome tens of thousands of children are leaving their classrooms on Friday to demand systematic actions to address a growing climate crisis as youth-driven, grassroots organizations coordinated demonstrations and young activists testified on Capitol Hill this week.\n\nWhile simple individual level actions are beneficial and can in part help address global climate change, advocates and scientists agree massive changes are needed to adequately prevent climate change's destruction.\n\n'It's our future that's at stake': US students plan to skip school Friday to fight climate 'emergency'\n\nHow to save the Earth, in 1990\n\nBroken up into sections like \"Guarding Our Buried Treasures,\" \"Protecting Animals\" and \"Spending Energy Wisely,\" the book was a sort of \"how-to\" guide to get children interested in and thinking about concrete environmental action.\n\nThe book offered practical advice on how to recycle effectively, reduce water use and avoid pollution and get others involved in the action.\n\n\"When you're in a toy store, and you see something you like, check out how well it's made. Is it cheap plastic that will break and get tossed out right away? Or is it made to last,\" the book says.\n\n\"If you go food shopping with your family, buy eggs in cardboard, not Styrofoam cartoons. (Then reuse the cartons for art projects),\" another section advises.\n\nFrom not having kids to battling anxiety: Climate change is shaping life choices and affecting mental health\n\n\"Use beeswax crayons. They aren't made from oil. ... Paint and draw on recycled paper,\" another reads.\n\n\"These are all good things to do,\" says J. Timmons Roberts, the Ittleson Professor of Environmental Studies at Brown University. \"They are all worthwhile things to do, but the big ones really are not here.\"\n\n'Simple things' to do to combat climate change in 2019\n\nIn the same year the children's book was released, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also released its first report on climate change, its impacts and how humans could respond.\n\nScientists had known for decades at the time about the processes of global climate change, but have since developed a deeper understanding and issued more dire warnings.\n\n\"As climate science and the Earth\u2019s climate have continued to evolve over recent decades, increasing evidence of anthropogenic influences on climate change has been found. Correspondingly, the IPCC has made increasingly more definitive statements about human impacts on climate,\" a panel of experts wrote in an IPCC paper on the history of climate science.\n\nAccordingly, the advice given even to children on how to address climate change has been updated.\n\nIn 2009, a revised version \u2013 \"The New 50 Simple Things Kids Can Do To Save The Earth\" \u2013 suggests updated practices to combat environmental harm, including cutting down on plastic bottles, protecting wetlands and using solar power.\n\nOther acts that can still have a big impact include changing habits around travel and housing, Roberts says.\n\nUrging parents to buy an efficient electric car and reduce the number of flights taken each year or not bringing 10 different appliances to college are still practical steps teens can take to reduce their impact on climate change, Roberts says.\n\nThe way children are influencing others to act has also changed. The revised version of the book removed the chapter \"Write to World Leaders.\"\n\n\"Twenty years ago that may have been something to do, but now you have to get in the face of the leaders,\" Roberts said.\n\nNo future, no children: Teens refusing to have kids until there's action on climate change\n\nSome children have also taken more personal approaches. Canadian Emma Lim, 18, launched the \"#NoFutureNoChildren\" movement this week, a pledge not to have children until governments take serious action against climate change.", "description": "A 1990s book told kids of the \"simple things\" to do to affect the environment.
