Although its chief executive Jeff Bezos has promised that the investment will pay off in the long-run, the move is set to cost billions of dollars, proving more expensive than first thought.\n\nAmazon said that revenues in the three months to the end of September had increased by 24pc to $70bn (\u00a355bn). However, profits dropped from $2.8bn a year ago to $2.1bn.\n\nIt is the first time profits have fallen year-on-year since the first half of 2017, a surprise to investors who have enjoyed increasingly reliable profit growth after years of austere margins.\n\nAmazon also warned that sales in the fourth quarter were likely to grow at a much slower rate. It said it expected revenues to grow between 11pc and 20pc in the quarter, and that profits would decline again.", "description": "Amazon has revealed its first drop in profits in more than two years as the company\u2019s heavy spending on faster package delivery outweighed a rise in sales.", "authors": ["James Titcomb", "Robin Pagnamenta"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000214033800-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
