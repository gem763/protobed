REUTERS/Edgard Garrido\n\nTen cities have been placed in a state of emergency and under evening lockdown since riots broke out last Friday during protests at high living costs and inequality.\n\nAs pressure on the government mounted, centre-right President Sebastian Pinera said he would meet with opposition leaders on Tuesday to forge a \u201cnew social contract.\u201d\n\nOnly minor incidents were reported into the early hours of Tuesday, the military said.\n\nThe general in charge of security in Santiago said he was nonetheless aware of videos circulating on social media suggesting brutality by police or the military in dealing with protesters and vandals.\n\n\u201cWe are investigating every one of these situations. We\u2019re not going to hide anything,\u201d General Javier Iturriaga told reporters.\n\nLater in the morning, interior ministry sub-secretary Rodrigo Ubilla declined to identify the 15 people killed since last Friday.\n\nIn a heated exchange with reporters, he said 11 people had died in arson attempts, looting and rioting in Santiago, while two people had died of gunshot wounds. Two others died in vehicle-related accidents, one outside of Santiago and one, further south, in the port city of Talcahuano.\n\nThe Talcahuano prosecutor said that case involved a 23-year-old man run over by a military vehicle.\n\nThe Chilean Institute for Human Rights said by Monday night it had registered 84 people injured by firearms.\n\nAmnesty International on Tuesday said in an open letter to Pinera that it was concerned over human rights violations, and limitations imposed by the military during city-wide evening lockdowns.\n\n\u201cThe sole fact that some groups or people have committed acts of violence in a protest does not authorise security forces to dissolve them with the use of force,\u201d Amnesty International Americas director Erika Guevara said.\n\nU.N. human rights boss Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile, called on Monday for independent investigations into the deaths in weekend protests, citing \u201cdisturbing allegations\u201d of excessive use of force by security forces.\n\nSANTIAGO RUBBLE\n\nThe widespread protests sowed destruction across the city. Street cleaners and working parties of volunteers on Tuesday struggled to tidy and repair Santiago\u2019s central Plaza Italia, the focal point of much of the unrest, was littered with broken glass and stone, graffiti and still-smoldering fires.\n\nMany downtown streets still reeked of tear gas, and the majority of schools across the city remained closed on Tuesday.\n\nTraffic and public transportation were snarled across the city during the morning commute.\n\nRoxana Yanez, 56, a factory worker, said she had had a difficult commute.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, we support these protests. We don\u2019t earn much, just enough to pay our bus fare,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t support is disorder, riots, looting. That doesn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nThe protests were sparked by an increase in public transport fares in early October. But they reflect simmering anger over intense economic inequality in Chile, as well as costly health, education and pension systems seen by many as inadequate.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t stop until people see real change,\u201d said Brandon Rodriguez, 25, a security guard. \u201cGovernments of the left and right have come and gone...but nothing changes for ordinary people.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe unrest has yet to dock copper output in Chile, the world\u2019s top producer, mining officials said.\n\nWorkers at BHP\u2019s Escondida copper mine, the world\u2019s largest, nonetheless initiated a 5-hour strike Tuesday morning, union officials told Reuters.\n\nAt Santiago\u2019s international airport, many passengers were stranded after hundreds of flights were cancelled by major airlines over several days and airlines laid out camp beds on the airport forecourt to accommodate them.", "description": "Chile's military said it would investigate allegations of human rights violations in days of riots, looting and protests throughout the country that have left 15 dead and led to the arrest of more than 2,600.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443785033&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1EB", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
