The 45-year-old said he once blew his entire paycheck from the film on a new car in his younger years, but said he\u2019s much wiser today.\n\nFaison spoke to reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour and opened up about just how much being a comedic performer contributed to him landing his latest role on the new ABC series \u201cEmergence,\u201d which sees a sheriff in her search for answers in a case involving a young child found near the site of a mysterious accident.\n\nZAC BRAFF'S SHOW 'ALEX, INC' IS LESS RISQUE THAN 'SCRUBS:' 'IT'S MORE OF A FAMILY SHOW'\n\n\u201cAs an actor, it's what I wanted to do when I first got into \u2013 when I first became an actor,\u201d said Faison. \u201cI wanted to be Lando Calrissian, you know what I mean? I wanted to be, you know, Bruce Willis in 'Die Hard.' I wanted to be in things like that and somewhere along the line I became a funny guy, I don't know how it happened but somewhere along the line.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cScrubs\u201d alum acted in the iconic series for nine seasons and said that when he auditioned for the dramatic role in \u201cEmergence,\u201d he was sure the producers would take one look at him and only see Christopher Turk, his role on the famed TV doctor comedy.\n\n\u201cWhen I auditioned for this \u2013 I remember auditioning for this and going and meeting up with my wife at our son's soccer practice and being like I think they just saw Turk,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd then getting the role and being told that 'Yeah when you walked in, we were like oh, Turk's here. And then halfway through the audition, we were like, \u2018Oh no, wow \u2013 he just got the part,' [It] was really awesome and so it's gratifying.\u201d\n\n'SCRUBS' ACTOR SAM LLOYD DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER, BRAIN TUMOR WEEKS AFTER WELCOMING SON\n\nContinued Faison: \u201cIt's like all right, so all of those years actually prepared me for this moment. I was hungry still, you know what I mean. And you hear about people being in this industry for 20-something years and they're no longer hungry \u2013 I really wanted this. You know, I worked hard for this opportunity. So it was great.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how he and wife CaCee Cobb juggle the balancing act of parenting and still having time to themselves, the \u201cRemember the Titans\u201d star said date night for the pair is simply putting the kids to bed and watching TV.\n\n\u201cWell, my wife has control of the remote control so it's a lot of 'Dateline.' Nothing brings you together like murder,\u201d quipped Faison. \u201cAnd the crazy thing is now I know if something were to happen to my wife, I'd need to check under her fingernails because she's going to leave clues as to who did this.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife is probably the biggest ball buster in the history of ball busters and so any time I feel like I'm on another level, she knocks me back down,\u201d added Faison. \u201cSo you know, I wish I could do the same with her but I don't have that skill, she has that skill.\u201d\n\nTLC's CHILLI APPROVES OF WEEZER'S COVER OF HIT SONG 'NO SCRUBS'\n\n\u201cIt comes out wrong and all of a sudden I'm in the doghouse so yeah.\u201d\n\nSo, for a guy who has been in the game as long as Faison, how does one keep friends in the business when many actors are vying for the same roles? Faison said it\u2019s not as difficult as one might think, adding that it takes a little self-awareness.\n\n\u201cYou've got to understand that everybody really is trying to make it happen for themselves. And once you realize that and don't want to fault anybody with their own their flaws or anything like that, it's really easy to be friends with someone,\u201d he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\n\u201cYou know, everybody's here in Hollywood to make it happen, you know what I mean. And sometimes, you making it happen means I can't necessarily be as close to you as I should be. And once you get past all that, it's like, 'Oh all right, then yeah we could be friends then.' And that's what I'm learning.\"\n\n\u201cEmergence\u201d airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.", "description": "There is much to be said about longevity in Hollywood.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Donald-Faison-Emergence.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
