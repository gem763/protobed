Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shed 0.2% to 7,140.04.\n\nU.S. futures pointed to early losses with the contract for the Dow Jones industrial average down 0.5% to 26,392.00. S&P 500 futures also lost 0.5% to 2,936.40.\n\nThe world\u2019s two largest economies are set to resume trade talks this week and markets have been quick to swing on any hint of movement in their dispute, which has dragged on manufacturing around the world, including Asia, and pushed CEOs to delay investments amid uncertainty.\n\nRobert Carnell, chief economist and head of research Asia-Pacific at ING, noted some optimism about the trade talks but warned that past optimism was often misplaced.\n\n\u201cIt looks as if we are back to considering the merits of a narrow trade deal today, as news stories break suggesting that China is not looking to make a broader trade deal along the lines it is reported the U.S. is seeking,\u201d he said.\n\nChinese offices were closed for a holiday, and officials did not respond to requests for comment on a report by Bloomberg that Chinese negotiators were seeking to limit the scope of the talks. That could reduce the likelihood of progress.\n\nIn Asian trading, Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 0.2% to finish at 21,375.25 while Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.7% to 6,563.60. South Korea\u2019s Kospi was little changed, inching up less than 0.1% to 2,021.73. The Sensex in India picked up 0.4% to 37,816.91. Chinese markets are due to reopen on Tuesday after a weeklong break.\n\nWall Street ended a choppy week of trading with a broad rally that drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average more than 370 points higher.\n\nThe gains Friday also gave the S&P 500 its best day in seven weeks, though the benchmark index still finished with its third straight weekly loss. The job market data for September showed the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to a five-decade low and employers were adding jobs at a healthy clip.\n\nA strong jobs market would enable U.S. households to keep spending, supporting the economy at a time when slowing growth abroad poses a threat and President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with China is sapping exports and manufacturing.\n\nCHINA\u2019S RESERVES: China\u2019s foreign currency reserves declined more than expected, prompting suggestions Beijing might have bought yuan to support the Chinese currency\u2019s exchange rate ahead of trade talks with Washington. The reserves, the world\u2019s biggest, fell by $14.8 billion to just under $3.1 trillion in September. The yuan was allowed to tumble to an 11-year low against the dollar in August but has stabilized since then. Washington complains Beijing depresses its exchange rate to make Chinese exports less expensive abroad, hurting foreign competitors. If Beijing is selling foreign currency, then the yuan\u2019s stability might reflect \u201cintervention following the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks,\u201d said Martin Lynge Rasmussen of Capital Economics in a report.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude added 16 cents to $52.97 a barrel. It rose 36 cents to settle at $52.81 per barrel Friday. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 10 cents to $58.47 per barrel.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar edged up to 106.87 Japanese yen from 106.77 yen Friday. The euro fell to $1.0969 from $1.0979.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed.", "description": "TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Global shares were mixed Monday, following a reassuring report on U.S. jobs, while investors cautiously awaited the outcome of trade talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/07/b9158b_south-korea-financial-markets-35622-currency-traders-work-foreign-exchange-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
