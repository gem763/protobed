It described Red 5 as \u201cthe entity that holds Performance Rights on behalf of a number of early-stage staff\u201d and confirmed that one of its owners is Andrew Karantzis, iSignthis\u2019 chief sales officer and the brother of chief executive John Karantzis. What\u2019s more, Red 5\u2019s company secretary is Irene Naumova, Andrew\u2019s wife.\n\nFor nearly four weeks, iSignthis had maintained \u2013 bizarrely, given what we now know \u2013 it was \u201cnot privy to ownership of entities on our register\u201d. That\u2019s right, an internationally esteemed Know Your Customer platform claimed for a month not to know the identity of its second-largest shareholder (to which it had already issued 130 million performance shares), then abruptly disclosed its ownership by a member of both executive management and the CEO\u2019s family. Witching.\n\nYou might forget your brother\u2019s birthday, but forgetting he owns a slab of your company while sharing an office with him?\n\nRegardless, you could never forget his wife. When not administering the affairs of Red 5 or cavorting around Cyprus, Irina (as she goes by on social media) is a passionate advocate for breastfeeding older children. On her Facebook page, Moo Moo Time (no kidding), she is shown heavily pregnant and suckling her three-year-old daughter while also embracing her six-year-old son. In another photo, Naumova tandem feeds the young girl and the newborn.\n\nThis is easily the most outlandish parenting exhibition we\u2019ve seen since Jo Walker, wife of then BT chief Brad Cooper, photographed their daughter all over Europe dressed as the Bride of Chucky (and called it #twinning). Freak.\n\nNaumova was a Miss Universe Western Australia finalist in 2014. At her pageant, the aspiring beauty queen identified lifelong lactation, not world peace, as her cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre.\n\nSo perhaps Red 5 isn't a family warehouse through which to tunnel cash out of iSignthis, but the seed fund for a global campaign of a breastfeeding princess. Eminently forgettable. Almost slipped our minds too\u2026", "description": "You might forget your brother\u2019s birthday, but forgetting he owns a slab of your company while sharing an office with him?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6637%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f8715d138badeedaad57ab640a475ee415602b", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
