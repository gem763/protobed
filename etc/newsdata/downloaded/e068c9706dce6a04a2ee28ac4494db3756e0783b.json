Sometimes our village is hit and nobody understands who's firing, where it's coming from. Evdokia Vasilieva Taranenko Local resident, Pervomaiske\n\nThe conflict has forced more than 1,5 million people to leave their homes and more than a million to flee the country.\n\nToday, 4 million people in Ukraine are in need of humanitarian aid\n\nThe conflict in eastern Ukraine is far from over. This year, 400 civilians have been injured or killed along the contact line separating the government-controlled areas from the pro-Russian separatist regions. That\u2019s more than last year. Not a day goes by without hearing the sound of shelling despite an official ceasefire. We heard it when we visited 80-year old Evdokia Vasilieva Taranenko. She has lived in the village of Pervomaiske for more than half her life. Her home lies just three kilometers from the frontline and has been hit twice.\n\n\u201cA bomb fell on the road \u2013 it was during the day.\u201d (She points at the broken windows in her house) \u201cThe impact broke these windows. I was inside the house when it happened.\u201d\n\nEvdokia has lived with a damaged roof for two years. This autumn, she received help from the EU-backed NGOPeople in Need. It has helped repair 40 houses in the village ahead of winter, mainly restoring roofs and windows.\n\n\u201cIn some cases we only give out the material,\u201d says Sergey Saenko, Shelter Programme manager with People in Need. \u201cWe give out cash grants as well, so that people can buy the material themselves. Often, as there are very vulnerable people living on the frontline, who cannot carry out the repair work themselves, we provide the material, we choose a local team and we pay for the work.\u201d\n\nNearly half of the village\u2019s inhabitants left after conflict broke out in 2014, but they are starting to come back. Today there are 1,500 of them \u2013 mainly elderly and unemployed people \u2013 living in and repairing damaged houses right next to abandoned ones too dangerous to go near because of the risk of land mines\n\n\u201cThis is war. Sometimes our village is hit during the day and nobody understands anything \u2013 who\u2019s firing, where it\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not easy. When night falls, it\u2019s even scarier,\u201d Evdokia tells us.\n\nOne night in Kiev and 6am train to the contact line that splits Ukraine in government controlled areas and rebel pro-Russian areas. Along this line people continue to die, but we are going to see how people continue to live coping with this frozen conflict.

The small town is right near the frontline in the so-called Red Zone and experiences frequent shelling. The local population, which is already struggling to get by, is dreading winter. Entire areas have been without gas since the conflict broke out in 2014.\n\n\u201cRight now we have a list of 250 households that are in need of immediate assistance,\u201d says Andrew Meyer, Head of Programs at People in Need. \u201cWe decided that one way to provide sort of a permanent solution to the winterization of these homes is to provide these solid-fuel furnaces, which we\u2019ve already installed, and then follow up with firewood that they can use to burn throughout the winter.\u201d\n\nThe Czech NGO has reached half of the people in need in Marinka. Each family has received six cubic meters of firewood, which should cover the winter period. For Vitaly Vladimirovich, being an ex-miner was useful in the beginning, but it no longer helps.\n\n\u201cEven after the war started we didn\u2019t have this established border that we have now,\u201d he tells us. \u201cSo it was much easier to move coal from one side to the other, and through my connections in the mine, I was able to get coal from time to time, even if I wasn\u2019t working there anymore.\u201d\n\nAccording to the NGOs working here, the humanitarian situation is getting worse. People are returning to their homes, but they don\u2019t have jobs. The movement of merchandise across the border is limited and goods are hard to get hold of \u2013 those that do get through are expensive.\n\n\u201cIn the last year and a half, as the contact line has stabilized, we have been targeting specifically those living in conflict-affected areas,\u201d says Mathias Eick of the EU\u2019s Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department (ECHO).\n\n\u201cBut the challenge, of course, lies in the fact that we can have access here in the government controlled areas, but it\u2019s much more difficult for us to access the population in non-government controlled areas.\u201d\n\nShelter repair and heating are just some of the basic needs of those living along the contact line like Evdokia. According to People in Need the level of food insecurity has doubled in this past year alone.", "description": "Aid Zone takes us to the frontline in Ukraine, where four million people are in need of humanitarian aid.", "authors": ["Evdokia Vasilieva Taranenko"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/410085/1000x563_410085.jpg", "published_at": "2017-12-07"}
