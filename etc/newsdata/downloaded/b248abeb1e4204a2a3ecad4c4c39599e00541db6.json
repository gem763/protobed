And their job of advising and holding cofounder and CEO Adam Neumann accountable just became even more critical.\n\nThe office-rental firm is delaying the timeline for its initial public offering plan amid a wave of criticism in recent weeks, including complaints over a deal under which the company paid Neumann $5.9 million for use of the word \"We.\" That arrangement was reversed earlier this month.\n\nWeWork also made headlines when the firm revealed there were no women on its seven-member board of directors. The company quickly amended its federal filing to include one female: Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei. In the filing, WeWork said it plans to add additional directors after the IPO to create a more diverse group.\n\nNeumann stills retains control of the company, even after a decline in the number of his votes per share. The change was part of a sweeping revision to its IPO filing to address investor concerns over how WeWork will be controlled after the public offering. Among them is a shift to give the board the power to remove Neumann. His wife \u2014 Rebekah Paltrow Neumann \u2014 will also no longer be involved in determining the next CEO.\n\nBelow are the board members' connections to WeWork, plus some \u2014 but not all \u2014 their professional highlights.", "description": "WeWork added a single female director after backlash to the 7-member, all-male board unveiled last month.", "authors": ["Joe Williams"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7ff91e2e22af0b417b1f54-1136-568.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
