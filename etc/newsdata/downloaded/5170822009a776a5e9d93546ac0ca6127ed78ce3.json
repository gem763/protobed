The firm has $1.5 trillion in assets under management, so her recommendations carry substantial weight. And Krosby says she's taking a careful approach to a market that is torn between two forces.\n\nStocks continue to rise because investors don't want to be left out, and the market tends to soar on any piece of good news, she says. But at the same time, it will struggle to overcome some lingering threats.\n\n\"We still have a market that is vulnerable to headline risks regarding tariffs,\" she said. \"Everything seems to work its way back to the trade war.\"\n\nFor that reason, even though she calls the market \"overbought,\" she still recommends taking on risk and not getting overly defensive. In an exclusive interview with Business Insider, Krosby called the following sectors and niches especially attractive:\n\nIndustrials\n\nKrosby said there are noteworthy opportunities in two parts of the industrial sector. Defense contractors stand to benefit from their hefty contracts, the growing US defense budget, and rising spending on next-generation military research.\n\nMeanwhile shares of big exporters have struggled so badly that there are a lot of opportunities for improvement.\n\n\"Industrials have really been damaged by the trade war and the stronger US dollar, and add to that slower global economic growth,\" Krosby said. Good developments on any of those fronts would lift those companies, and would also help small and mid cap stocks and emerging markets indexes rally.\n\nInvestors who want broad exposure to the sector could get it through the SPDR Industrial Select Sector ETF.\n\nFinancials\n\nThe situation is similar for the financial sector in her opinion. She said she finds regional bank stocks attractive, while asset managers have gotten a boost thanks to some recent acquisitions and that trend could continue.\n\nBut signs of an improved economy would also provide a lift to the whole sector.\n\n\"If economic data continues to turn, confidence comes back, the 10-year yield should move accordingly. That would be good for banks and insurance companies,\" she said.\n\nOne way to gain exposure to financials is through the SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF.\n\nRead more: The stock chief at a $1 trillion firm warns of 5 years of dismal market returns \u2014 and outlines 4 themes traders can use to keep outperforming\n\nDiscretionary\n\nWhile a lot of companies are piling into the streaming entertainment business and spending is high, Krosby said she has a positive view of media companies because there's that much demand for new media in the US and around the world. She also said fast food companies remain attractive as long as gas prices are stable and hiring is solid.\n\nIn general she said it's a good idea to take advantage of pullbacks in consumer discretionary stocks.\n\nThose looking for exposure to the consumer discretionary sector itself could gain it with the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ETF.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhile the energy sector has had a relatively rough year, Krosby says large, integrated companies look relatively appealing and offer strong cash flows and dividends compared to their peers.\n\nInvestors can get into energy stocks broadly through the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF.\n\nHealthcare\n\nWhile concerns about the potential implementation of a Medicare for All program and new drug price regulations have affected health care companies, she said life sciences and medical equipment both remain attractive and are less affected by those risks.\n\nOne way to get involved in the sector is through the SPDR Health Care Select Sector ETF.", "description": "Prudential's Quincy Krosby says trade fears and high prices shouldn't keep investors on the sidelines.", "authors": ["Marley Jay"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/594a97c0114ab6bd008b4584-750-375.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
