(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nThe White House is preparing to roll out its plan to reduce gun violence next week, even as President Trump remains conflicted behind the scenes on what provisions he will ultimately support and Senate Republicans continue to say they will only consider proposals endorsed by the president.\n\nWhite House aides have been scrambling for ideas that would allow the president to argue he is addressing the issue of mass shootings but would still be palatable to the National Rifle Association. Trump has said in recent days that he is open to supporting an expansion of background checks on certain gun sales, but he is under pressure from many Republicans and the gun lobby to abandon the idea.\n\nMeanwhile, congressional Republicans \u2014 who are wary of any new gun restrictions but have been under public pressure for weeks to do something in response to the tragedies \u2014 are going on the offensive, highlighting comments from former congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas at Thursday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate when he vowed to seize assault weapons from gun owners through a mandatory buyback program.\n\nAt the House Republicans\u2019 annual retreat in Baltimore on Friday, House Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said talk of gun confiscation will \u201cabsolutely\u201d motivate people to vote Republican.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely clear that there\u2019s one party here that absolutely will make sure that we are defending the Second Amendment, defending Americans\u2019 constitutional rights,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThere is another party \u2014 and you\u2019ve seen it with the Democrats \u2014 who really have no care and no concern about the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe primary focus remains on the White House, where weeks have passed since a pair of mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, galvanized public pressure for new gun measures that have since been prioritized by congressional Democrats.\n\nThe White House is looking into a number of ideas, including a version of expanded background checks and additional resources for addressing mental-health issues. Attorney General William P. Barr has been drafting legislation that would expedite the death penalty for people accused of mass shootings \u2014 although questions have been raised about how much of a deterrence that would be given that the perpetrators of mass shootings often expect to be killed in the massacre.\n\nBut even people close to the White House, including those who have spoken to the president frequently on potential gun measures, remain unsure of what Trump will embrace.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sort of waiting for the baby to be born here,\u201d Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who is working on his own modest gun restrictions, said Friday.\n\nShortly after he was briefed by advisers on potential policy options Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that a \u201clot of progress was made\u201d but gave no specifics.\n\nWhether he would support expanded background checks was up to Democrats, he said.\n\n\u201cIf this is a movement by the Democrats to take your guns away, then it\u2019s never going to happen because we're never going to let that happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will always be there for our Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nPrivately, the White House has floated at least one particularly unorthodox idea: an app connected to the National Instant Criminal Background Checks system that could be used to conduct background checks on private gun sales, according to three senators and other officials familiar with the proposal who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the proposals have not been finalized.\n\nIn turn, lawmakers and congressional aides have pointed out to the White House potential flaws in the proposal, such as security issues with the app and how it would affect how law enforcement officials access records on gun ownership.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.), who said he had been told of the idea by one White House official, raised concerns about gun owners\u2019 personal data being so freely available on a handheld device, and said it \u201cwould kind of be a de facto registry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fraught with a lot of issues when it comes to some of the Second Amendment concerns,\u201d Thune said.\n\nTrump himself has sent confusing signals in his conversations with senators.\n\nWhen the president spoke by phone earlier this week with Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) \u2014 three critical lawmakers in the background-check debate \u2014 he appeared to know little about what his administration was proposing or what he was going to do about guns, according to people familiar with the discussion who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conversation. Trump asked questions about various proposals that have been in the news for weeks.\n\nHe veered from asking senators about vaping to complaining about CNN and bragging about GOP wins in a pair of closely-watched special elections in North Carolina, according to these people. The senators gave him plaudits on vaping but were silent during his boasts about his political victories.\n\nTrump met with senior staff Thursday afternoon, including the domestic policy council, aides to Vice President Pence and other political and policy officials.\n\nTrump\u2019s aides have given him data that show his supporters are skeptical of expanding background checks and there are many high-intensity voters who would \u201creally oppose it,\u201d according to one political adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private polling. A number of Trump\u2019s aides have argued against any expansive background-check bill.\n\nYet in the Senate, proponents of expanding background checks have worked to influence Republicans who either weren\u2019t in the Senate for the 2013 debate on guns or have indicated that they are rethinking their opposition to the legislation drafted by Manchin and Toomey.\n\nOne is Graham, a close Trump ally who chairs the committee that oversees gun policy. He said Thursday that he is open to supporting the 2013 background-checks bill, as long as he secures changes that he is discussing with its chief authors.\n\nGraham indicated that he is rethinking the issue after attacks in Odessa, Tex., in which the gunman did not undergo a background check when he obtained the rifle used in the Aug. 31 massacre. The shooter, Seth Ator, had previously failed a background check.\n\n\u201cThe Odessa case is a good example,\u201d Graham said. \u201cGuy was mentally ill. Could not get a gun when he went to the gun stores because he was in the background check system. Bought a gun from a nonfamily, non-friend person, who\u2019s selling guns for money. So I\u2019d like to capture that transaction.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have expressed varying levels of willingness to negotiate with the White House \u2014 particularly on the expansion of background checks.\n\nParty leaders in both chambers have urged Senate Republicans to take up a House-passed bill that would require background checks for commercial sales over the Internet and at gun shows and would also require private transfers to be screened through a federally licensed gun dealer.\n\nThe White House has threatened to veto that bill, and some Senate Democrats have discussed a narrower expansion of background checks along the lines of the Manchin-Toomey proposal, which would require them for all commercial sales while leaving private sales untouched.\n\nDemocrats will likely have to wrestle with how much they are willing to retreat from their zero-loophole stance. Many Republicans, for instance, are dead-set against restricting private sales or transfers \u2014 frequently raising the example of a parent giving a treasured rifle to a child or a person loaning a handgun to a trusted friend threatened by an abusive partner.\n\n\u201cIf it's short of universal background checks, it doesn't solve the problem,\u201d said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), who is chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and has had conversations with White House officials. \u201cI want to see what they have to offer. But the fact of the matter is there's some things that they could do that just won't cut the mustard.\u201d\n\nDeBonis reported from Baltimore.", "description": "The White House is looking into a number of ideas, including some version of expanded background checks and additional resources for addressing mental-health issues.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/1rFYceuVMVW11nJiGQtrUUw9pKo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B5JMIHF2XAI6TDUDJZTIP2MYCQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
