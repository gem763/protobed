The injured officers are in critical condition.\n\nThe attack took place on Monday morning near Aguililla when a squad of Michoac\u00e1n State Police were patrolling the area. Initially, authorities believed that 14 officers died in the attack, however, they found that one of the men was actually alive and rushed him to a local hospital along with three other injured cops.\n\nLarge swaths of Michoac\u00e1n are now battlegrounds as convoys of gunmen with Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) clash with cells tied to Los Viagras-La Familia over drug trafficking routes and production regions.\n\nMexico\u2019s Federal Security Secretariat condemned the attack on social media, claiming that they were willing to help the state in bringing the suspects to justice.\n\nLa #SSPC condena el ataque en el que murieron 14 agentes policiacos en Aguililla, Michoac\u00e1n. Nos encontramos en comunicaci\u00f3n y ponemos a disposici\u00f3n del gobierno del estado todos nuestros recursos humanos y tecnol\u00f3gicos para dar con los agresores y llevarlos ante la justicia. \u2014 Secretar\u00eda de Seguridad y Protecci\u00f3n Ciudadana (@SSPCMexico) October 14, 2019\n\nLaw enforcement sources revealed that the CJNG gunmen used armored SUVs, .50 caliber rifles, machine guns, and other weapons to quickly overpower authorities. The duty-issued weapons used by the cops proved largely ineffective. The officers radioed for help but none arrived\u2013despite a military base less than one mile from ambush scene.\n\nAfter the initial confrontation, the gunmen approached the police vehicles for finishing shots and placed several poster boards signed by the CJNG. The ambush comes at a time when Michoac\u00e1n Governor Silvano Aureoles Conejo claims that crime is down.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, and other areas to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.
