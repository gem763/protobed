The yen\n\nbreached the 108 mark and was last at 107.98 yen per dollar,\n\ndown 0.1% on the day and far from its seven-month high of 104.46\n\nplumbed last month.\n\nThe Aussie hit a six-week high and the offshore Chinese yuan\n\nrose 0.5% CNH=EBS to a three-week high of 7.0737 against the\n\ndollar.\n\nMarket attention now turns to the ECB, the first of a series\n\nof major central bank events, with the Federal Reserve and the\n\nBank of Japan meeting next week.\n\nInvestors almost universally expect a rate cut at Thursday's\n\nECB meeting as policymakers try to prop up the region's ailing\n\neconomy.\n\nThe real uncertainty is whether policymakers will restart a\n\nquantitative easing programme after some members of the\n\ngoverning council in recent weeks expressed doubt about the need\n\nto relaunch asset purchases. SEB strategist Jussi Hiljanen said he expected the ECB to\n\ncut the deposit rate by 10 basis points, extend the forward\n\nguidance on rates by six months and announce the restart of a\n\nquantitative easing programme with monthly purchases lower than\n\nthe market anticipated.\n\n\"Such a package of stimulus measures would be a\n\ndisappointment for the market, pushing long rates higher and\n\nhigher and steepening the curve,\" Hiljanen said.\n\nThe single currency EUR=EBS has shed 3.5% since June and\n\nwas steady at $1.1017 in early European trade.\n\nThe dollar was slightly lower against a basket of currencies\n\nat 98.599 .\n\nSterling was little changed GBP=D3 EURGBP=D3 . The pound\n\nrocketed to a six-week high on Monday, reversing last week's\n\nlosses as investors welcomed the British parliament's move to\n\nblock a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nDespite the more positive mood in risk assets this week,\n\nanalysts expressed some caution about its sustainability.\n\n\"Just as the presidential tweet on tariffs this morning has\n\ninjected more momentum ... we are only one social media posting\n\naway from a thoroughly unpredictable President turning sentiment\n\non its head,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for\n\nAsia Pacific at brokerage OANDA.\n\n\n\n", "description": "FOREX-Euro pauses before ECB meeting as trade thaw triggers risk rally", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/forex_5_800x533_L_1411908638.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
