He said in a briefing that Eskom had found the Chinese and Vietnamese models offered greatest resonance for South Africa. \u201cAny talk of privatisation is part of the fake news industry,\u201d said Gordhan.\n\nBut Eskom\u2019s structure will be flattened, in a modernising move away from an old-fashioned vertical. Its transmission division will be hived off into a subsidiary of Eskom with its own board. In addition, the Eskom main board will be strengthened by new appointments.\n\nEskom Tx will be the power hub of the utility responsible, eventually, for both buying power from a variety of sources (both private and public) and then selling it to the distribution business of Eskom. It will be run as a Transmission System Market Operator.\n\nInternal competition\n\nEskom\u2019s generation business, largely its fleet of coal-fired power stations, will be regrouped into different and competitive clusters which Gordhan hopes will bring down the cost of electricity as a market for electricity is created. At the moment, consumers (both business and residential) are sitting ducks as Eskom is a near-complete monopoly. Monopolies are self-interested, drive up prices and look out for themselves, said Gordhan.\n\nHe said the internal market model now on the table will work, but it would take time to implement and to be passed through to customers.\n\nThe Eskom master plan follows the release of the Integrated Resource Plan by Mineral Resources and Energy minister Gwede Mantashe last week.\n\nLike that energy blue-print, the Eskom plan also plots a greener future, with a greater role envisaged for renewable energy part of the Eskom mix too.\n\nEskom is set to appoint a CEO next week, Gordhan revealed.\n\nHere is the good, the bad and the ugly in the Eskom plan.\n\nThe good\n\nThere is movement and it is considered. While Gordhan could provide no detail on Eskom\u2019s R430bn debt bill, a lot of work has gone into how the utility should be shaped for the future. What the plan provides is a degree of certainty. There is provision for an energy mix which coal lobbyists have pushed against like rock-drillers up against a tough seam.\n\nThe labour movement, extremely strong and well-organised at Eskom, appears to have been placated. The energy mix will be almost immediately altered with 2000 MW of capacity to be procured by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.\n\nEskom's promised energy availability factor is above 70% with a clear plan for the rest of summer which should ensure no further load-shedding. A bout of rotational power cuts in October has angered consumers.\n\nThe bad\n\nThere is no sell-off of anything other than a non-core Eskom property portfolio - so, no privatisation or even private sector participation. The vision is decidedly state-led and influenced by the Chinese growth model in that way. Except there is not a single South African state-led utility or company which has a history of successfully using the model of internal competition for growth: the Internet giant Naspers is built on internal competition but local examples of using the model in state-owned businesses have been dismal.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa\u2019s earlier pledges of introducing competition through private sector participation in Eskom appear to have been benched. This is not to suggest the private sector is superior to public sector utilities (around the world, privatised utility companies have a terrible reputation) but the markets had been primed for private sector participation.\n\nThe ugly\n\nEskom\u2019s staff complement of over 43 000 workers will not come down. The utility\u2019s staff bill is an albatross but there will be no cuts, Gordhan confirmed. Government can\u2019t be seen to adding to the unemployment burden which grew to an 11-year high, Stats SA revealed this week.\n\nStill, the utility cannot afford its staff.\n\nInstead, Gordhan and his team hope cost-savings will come from negotiating down the price of coal from miners and also from pushing for better value deals on large equipment. In addition, the tied mines are going to get an R20bn capital injection likely largely from better coal prices which could neuter any coal cost deals struck with the majors. The utility can\u2019t bring down the costs of its preferential procurement suppliers.\n\nTied mines are those on which power stations were built and were run as part of South Africa\u2019s minerals-energy complex.\n\nWhile the Chinese model has worked in China, South Africa does not have the dragon's productivity or efficiency record and neither is Eskom super-skilled to make the model work.\n\nMuch of Eskom\u2019s plan is premised on getting residents and municipalities to pay their electricity bills. \u201cAny culture of non-payment is unacceptable in a democracy,\u201d said Gordhan, referring to how a culture of tax payment had been successfully ingrained by a modernised SARS.\n\nGetting the majority of South Africans to pay for electricity has bedevilled every president since Nelson Mandela.", "description": "Minister of Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan followed the lead of China and Vietnam, both communist states with high growth state capitalist economies, to plot a future Eskom, says Ferial Haffajee.", "authors": ["Ferial Haffajee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8540/e59cb048e7ff4860a37cc14cc3c09148.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
