I stopped at a vegan cafe, I bought two sandwiches, two salads, two muffins all heated then took them to Pablo.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I passed him the bag of food through the car window at which point he asked me if I wanted to go to a restaurant to eat with him. I told him I was on my way to work. I found it a little odd. His facial expression made me feel a little uneasy. It was like a smirk.\n\n\u2018Until that point, I never felt unsafe or uneasy in my own home.\u2019\n\nThe singer even locked his bedroom door (Picture: Karwai Tang/Getty Images)\n\nThe Spanish-national ended up posting notes and money through his letterbox before following the singer on his runs and visits to the his local pub, The Spaniard\u2019s Inn.\n\nPablo was found guilty of stalking and Harry was even complimented by the judge for stopping \u2018out of the goodness of his heart\u2019 and trying to help a man \u2018down on his luck\u2019.\n\nIt was said the defendant had camped at the bus stop outside Harry\u2019s home because \u2018he know that Mr Styles lived close by\u2019 and at that point, Harry begun seeing the stalker every single day.\n\nThe situation didn\u2019t escalate until May, when the homeless man lunged at Harry and attempted to grab him while he was jogging through Regent\u2019s Park.\n\nThe Dunkirk actor went to the police in June after the defendant\u2019s \u2018frightening behaviour\u2019 left him scared in his own house.\n\nWhat made the situation even more scary was the fact the star saw Pablo around five days a week and the man even believed he was \u2018the soulmate of Harry Styles\u2019 and was \u2018spiritually protecting him\u2019.\n\nPablo waited close to Harry\u2019s home on purpose (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nHe even claimed that the star offered him money to have \u2018fun\u2019 in a hotel on their first meeting, which Harry denied happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHarry continued: \u2018I never really encountered this kind of behaviour before. I\u2019ve employed a night guard. I continue to lock my bedroom door at night.\u2019\n\nThe singer, who frequently saw Pablo in his pub, also added: \u2018He would sit in my eye line. He tried to speak to me on the second occasion as I was leaving. He would just kind of watch and look over and wait for me to leave. I was very confused very very uncomfortable, very confused, I didn\u2019t really understand it.\u2019\n\nDistrict Judge Nigel Dean said: \u2018It would be fair for me to say at this stage that I found Mr Styles to be a reliable and credible witness,\u2019 and praised Harry for helping with the case as much as possible.\n\n\u2018Mr Styles felt sorry for a young man who he saw to be living without a home during the winter when it was cold and raining very heavily and having first noticed him he then out of goodness of his heart stopped and offered to fund the defendant\u2019s hotel accommodation that evening.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t even leave his house without seeing traces of Pablo (Picture: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for NARAS)\n\n\u2018These were honest, well intended, good intentions from somebody who was trying to help another for whom he felt sorry and who he thought was down on his luck.\n\nThe judge ended it with: \u2018He knew perfectly well that what he was doing at that stage amounted to harassment of Mr Styles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I\u2019m quite satisfied that this behaviour had the effect of harassing Mr Styles.\u2019\n\nThe sentencing was adjourned at Hendon Magistrates court for reports and Pablo was released on conditional bail.\n\nMetro.co.uk have contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
