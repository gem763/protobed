But as all three of these people knew from experience, nesting is a real phenomenon\u2014an anticipatory, energetic state of being typical during pregnancy, one that\u2019s distinct from the more universal desire to keep one\u2019s living space tidy and comfortable.\n\nSome pregnant people never feel compelled to nest, but the ones who do are operating on instinct, according to Lauren Sosenko, a clinical psychologist who specializes in perinatal mental health. \u201cThe instinct to create a safe space\u2014which is what nesting is\u2014relates to anxiety, the threats and dangers that exist in the world and in our homes,\u201d Sosenko told me.\n\nWhile nesting, some people buy baby clothes or build nursery furniture. Others clean their bathrooms or organize their spice racks. The activities might have little to do with welcoming a newborn, but according to Sosenko, preparing for a baby isn\u2019t actually the primary function of nesting\u2014it\u2019s a perfectly normal outlet for the stress of impending parenthood. \u201cWhen nesting serves its purpose,\u201d she said, \u201cit can help mitigate our anxiety.\u201d The idea, according to a 2013 study in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, is that nesting is a means of \u201ccontrolling the physical environment.\u201d In Sosenko\u2019s words, nesting parents have \u201ca need to feel like they are preparing and creating a safe space.\u201d Even if a certain behavior doesn\u2019t truly alter a baby\u2019s environment\u2014as might be the case with organizing the spice rack\u2014it can bring a sense of control over the environment that eases anxiety.\n\nIf it doesn\u2019t, that might be an indicator of something deeper going on. Sosenko told me that while working with clients, she takes note of \u201cwhen nesting crosses the threshold of normative behavior and [their] anxiety is not being satiated\u201d; to her, that\u2019s \u201ca key indicator of the pregnant woman\u2019s emotional state and predisposition to postpartum depression.\u201d (While research on nesting is scant, this is something Sosenko has seen in her practice, and is in line with the finding that anxiety during pregnancy is linked to one\u2019s susceptibility to postpartum depression.) Noticing this sort of unsatiated anxiety manifested in nesting behaviors gives Sosenko a chance to offer her clients preemptive support before their children are born.\n\nSo much of what happens in pregnancy is out of expectant parents\u2019 hands, so it\u2019s no wonder that many seek control when and where they can get it. As Sosenko puts it, nesting \u201chelps us feel prepared for a time in our life when there\u2019s little we can do to prepare.\u201d My own nesting involved a lengthy to-do list. Some of the tasks were relatively straightforward, while others\u2014such as tracking down a paint shade that I\u2019d seen once a few months prior in a real-estate listing posted in an office window\u2014were more or less ridiculous. The latter were naturally more thrilling to accomplish. When I finally found the right swatch, I felt superpowered.", "description": "Readying the home for a newborn \u201chelps us feel prepared for a time in our life when there\u2019s little we can do to prepare,\u201d says one psychologist.", "authors": ["Mary Mann"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_136198470/facebook.jpg?1572276421", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
