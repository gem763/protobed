But because the government hasn't decided whether to seek the death penalty on some of the counts, attorneys could not advise Roof on the issue, the lawyer said.\n\nMarchant then entered the not-guilty plea on all counts.\n\nRoof appeared in a grey striped prison jumpsuit, his hands in shackles. He answered yes several times in response to the judge's questions but otherwise didn't speak.", "description": "A US judge has entered not guilty pleas on more than 30 federal charges, including for hate crimes, for a white man accused of gunning down nine parishioners at a black church in South Carolina.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/404/253b9fc8666b420295f7706b846e3340.jpg", "published_at": "2015-07-31"}
