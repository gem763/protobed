They hope to compel the hiring of more teachers and classroom aides of color so that the school workforce can better reflect the district\u2019s diversity.\n\nAD\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot, who won a landslide election in April, is showing signs of impatience with the union. On Monday, she and Janice K. Jackson, chief executive of Chicago Public Schools, sent a letter to Jesse Sharkey, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, imploring teachers to return to the classroom while negotiations continued. The mayor and schools CEO emphasized concern for the health and well-being of students and said the strike was jeopardizing playoff prospects for several of the city\u2019s top-ranked high school sports teams.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is that students and families have sacrificed a great deal that cannot be recovered,\u201d Lightfoot and Jackson wrote. \u201cGiven where we are in negotiations, this hardship is unnecessary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe union declined the request to go back to the classroom.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the mayor knows how labor negotiations work,\u201d Sharkey told WMAQ. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to work without a legally binding agreement.\u201d\n\nWednesday, teachers rallied outside city hall as Lightfoot delivered her first budget address. They shut down several downtown streets, tying morning rush-hour traffic in knots. Lightfoot announced an additional $163 million for Chicago Public Schools, but the amount will not satisfy teachers\u2019 demands.\n\nSome marginal signs of progress emerged. Michelle Gunderson, a teacher and trustee with the union, tweeted a photo of teachers gathered in a room with a document projected on a screen.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe are reaching tentative agreements on many items,\u201d Gunderson wrote Wednesday.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, showed up at a rally at Oscar DePriest Elementary to express her support for the strike, wearing a quilted jacket in red to match the striking teachers.\n\nAD\n\nMarching downtown on Wednesday, teachers pledged to remain out as long as necessary to press the city to meet their demands.\n\n\u201cMy kids have social and emotional issues and are screaming for help,\u201d said Kenziesha Charleston, who teaches second grade at Murray Language Academy. The school has a social worker only one day a week. \u201cI am trying to teach and figure out how to teach them to cope. I am only one person. We are tired.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJeanne Bakula, who teaches at Schubert Elementary School, said nearly every student comes from a low-income household and many rely on school meals.\n\n\u201cFor many of these kids, this is the only meal they are getting,\u201d Bakula said.\n\nHer students have sometimes endured trauma, and they struggle to learn. The school system, she said, needs to provide students with more mental health support.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to teach and be a counselor at the same time,\u201d Bakula said.\n\nTeachers emphasized the work other school staff members perform.\n\nKatherine Klinger, who teaches at John M. Palmer Elementary, lamented that her school has a nurse present just one day a week, leaving her nervous about students who need inhalers for asthma and rescue medication for allergies.\n\nAD\n\nThe strike posed hardships for parents, and their patience was fraying.\n\nFantasia Martin was waiting for a bus on Wednesday with her daughters Daliylah, 7, and Anastasia, 8. The girls are getting bored and antsy, their mother said.\n\n\u201cI hope the strike ends sooner, and they do what they need to do. It\u2019s not benefiting the kids or parents,\u201d Martin said. \u201cSchool is their safe place, and it\u2019s where they get a meal, too.\u201d\n\nBalingit reported from Washington.\n\nAD", "description": "Negotiations continue over wages, class sizes and school resources.", "authors": ["Susan Berger", "Moriah Balingit", "Reporter Covering National Education Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8Mh7G06TmqIGl4rIqD7BrwxiUac=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/XFFOFAHV3II6TDHQJTEZ65GRE4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
