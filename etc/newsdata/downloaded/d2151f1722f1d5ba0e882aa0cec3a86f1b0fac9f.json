I\u2019ll probably get arrested for saying that.\n\n\u2018Before I get arrested the point is why do we need to change Victoria\u2019s Secret?\n\n\u2018Why does it need to rebrand itself with plus-sized models?\u2019\n\nWhen Susanna Reid argued Victoria\u2019s Secret has a different purpose to a sexy stage show like Magic Mike, Piers argued: \u2018Victoria\u2019s Secret is selling a fantasy, and that\u2019s how they sell their underwear.\u2019\n\nPiers has history when it comes to criticising plus-sized models.\n\nLast year he citicised Cosmopolitan magazine for using Tess Holliday on the cover.\n\nPiers called the model \u2018hot\u2019 (Pictures: REX Features)\n\nThe famous shot showed the 34-year-old model posing in a green one-piece while blowing a kiss.\n\nBut Piers wasn\u2019t impressed, sharing the cover on Instagram and writing: \u2018As Britain battles an ever-worsening obesity crisis, this is the new cover of Cosmo.\n\n\u2018Apparently we\u2019re supposed to view it as a \u2018huge step forward for body positivity. What a load of old baloney. This cover is just as dangerous & misguided as celebrating size zero models.\u2019\n\nAlthough at the time Tess hit back at Piers tweeting: \u2018To everyone saying I\u2019m a burden to the British health care system, I\u2019m American so you don\u2019t have to worry about my fat ass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorry about what horrible people you are by whining about how me being on the cover of a glossy magazine impacts your small minded life.\u2019\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6.30am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
