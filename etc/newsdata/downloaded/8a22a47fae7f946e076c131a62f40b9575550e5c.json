He played all the great new music. Bernie [Taupin] and I freaked out when we first heard it. We hadn\u2019t heard anything like this before; Americana done in a very soulful, funky, laidback way. This music changed my life because of the way the songs were written; the lyrics, the musicianship. It was a huge influence on things like \u2018Tumbleweed Connection\u2019. They were amazing.\"\n\n\"When I first played Philadelphia, we had a little grand piano with two legs by the keyboard and none on the other end. The other end was held up by orange boxes. Before I went on, The Band came into the dressing room, and it was one of the most touching things. I had so much support when I started out. Neil Diamond introduced me at [West Hollywood venue] The Troubadour, The Band came to see me, George Harrison sent me a telegram. Those kinds of things, for a young artist, give you great ratification. I do my own radio show, I\u2019ve done it for four years, and the great thing is it gets me in contact with new singers. I make a point of phoning them when I like [their music], having lunch with them if I can. New music energises me. I know all the old stuff, but new music\u2026 If you hear something great by Billie Eilish or when Lorde did \u2018Royals\u2019 when she was 16, it\u2019s like: \u2018How did you do that?\u2019 It energises me. It makes me feel good. And then I play it to death on my radio show.\u201d", "description": "Sir Elton John picks the Tracks Of My Years with Ken Bruce", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p07r9ryf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
