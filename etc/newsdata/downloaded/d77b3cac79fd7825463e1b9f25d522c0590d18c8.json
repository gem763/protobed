And Jeff Hordley, Jurell Carter and Natalie J Robb did all of their own stunts as the characters end up underwater and an explosion rips through the boat.\n\nJeff enthused to Metro.co.uk: \u2018I am just thrilled not only to be working on the show but to be given the opportunity to do the high octane stunts and sequences such as underwater and diving it is a real thrill. \u2018Filming like this is exciting as you step outside your normal limits and push yourself. It then becomes a great sense of achievement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was very anxious about the underwater sequence to begin with, but once I had acclimatised to the surroundings and being in a water tank it was better. Personally I love snorkelling, going under water and seeing marine life when I\u2019m on holiday but this was a bit different.\n\n\u2018I had never used a diving regulator before, so that was new. The other big thing for me, that made the whole experience more difficult and challenging was obviously you have to do the whole thing without goggles or a mask so your visibility goes from seeing fully to about 15 percent. I could literally only just see a hand if it was really near my face, so that was a bit daunting. When the person moved away I could just about make out a distant figure in the water.\u2019\n\nNatalie admitted to having some trepidation over going underwater too. She said: \u2018Before we started I was apprehensive, but we had buddies underwater. I had a buddy called Wayne. The buddies are divers who stay with you underwater to make sure you always have access to air. Jeff\u2019s buddy was called Matt and they are really reassuring as they gave us so much confidence.\n\n\u2018The tank is quite deep. It\u2019s like a swimming pool, but really deep. It\u2019s dark and murky and dressed with weeds and rocks. In this case, there was a platform that I had to hook into and put my foot under. I would be on the regulator breathing until we needed to do the action, then the diver would swim over and remove the regulator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would then hold my breath whilst I did the filming action, then the buddy diver would come straight back in and give me more air. It was really exciting to do. Jeff and I both have slightly bloodshot eyes from filming but nothing eye drops aren\u2019t fixing. I have really enjoyed this whole shoot, it has been fantastic \u2013 a great experience and brilliant team work. That is the thing I love about working on Emmerdale, we get to do such great challenges that we would not normally get to do.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "There are dynamic scenes ahead.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/22_10_emm_nate_cain_moira_07-fb27_1570445057.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
