But he has goals in him, he has technique, is good physically.\n\n\u201cHe is a complete striker, a typical nine who can come first post, score with his head, turn in the box, play one-on-one, can score a scruffy goal as well, unbelievable shot. And a good boy. But let\u2019s see.\u201d\n\nOther youngsters who could be given debuts by Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp on Wednesday are 20-year-old goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher and Harvey Elliott, 16, who last season became the Premier League\u2019s youngest ever player before leaving Fulham for Liverpool this summer.\n\nWinger Xherdan Shaqiri has been ruled out by a small tear in his calf, but midfielder Naby Keita, who has been sidelined for seven games by a groin issue, is fit to make his return to action.\n\nSadio Mane (knock), Divock Origi (calf) and Alisson Becker (calf) are all unavailable.\n\nWhile Liverpool could field several youngsters against MK Dons, Ljinders stressed that winning was the priority, not rotation or experimenting with the side.\n\n\u201cWe want to compete in each competition, attack each competition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe work so hard to be in this situation, where we can compete in each one. For me, cup competitions are the soul of football.\u201d\n\nThe Dutchman was also asked about Klopp claiming the men\u2019s coach award at Monday\u2019s Best Fifa ceremony, where Alisson took home the men\u2019s goalkeeper award and Virgil van Dijk finished second among the nominees for the men\u2019s player award.\n\n\u201cBig compliment for our structure I think,\u201d Ljinders said. \u201cFor our owners, for our team, and then of course a big compliment for Jurgen himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud. He is not only the face of the team, of course, he is the face of the club, and I think not many foreign managers in a different country made the impact he made at Liverpool.\u201d", "description": "Rhian Brewster has been described by Liverpool\u00a0assistant boss Pep Lijnders as a \u201ccomplete striker\u201d ahead of a potential senior debut for the Reds in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.
