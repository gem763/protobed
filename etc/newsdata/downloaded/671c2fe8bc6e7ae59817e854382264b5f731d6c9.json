(AP/AP)\n\nMedia critic\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire employees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The threat followed an assessment by NOAA\u2019s Birmingham, Ala., office differing from President Trump\u2019s stated claim that Hurricane Dorian would strike Alabama. The Commerce Department\u2019s inspector general and a House panel are probing the events.\n\nIf reporters are interested in extracting a quote or two from Ross about the allegations, they can find him on Sept. 19, at Government Executive magazine\u2019s first-ever \u201cGovernment Hall of Fame\u201d gala. Government Executive is a division of Atlantic Media, the publishing house of Washington establishment pillar David Bradley. The event\u2019s mission: \u201cWe are introducing two unique awards programs to honor a select group of leaders and innovators in public service each year \u2014 The Government Hall of Fame \u2122 and The Theodore Roosevelt Government Leadership Awards. The Government Hall of Fame will celebrate distinguished civil servants who have demonstrated sustained achievement and unparalleled dedication to public service throughout their careers,\u201d reads a description on the gala Web page.\n\nMind you: Ross is not among the first wave of inductees to the Government Hall of Fame. They\u2019re people such as Constance Berry Newman, Norman Mineta and Donna Shalala. Instead, Ross will serve as a presenter, introducing Mineta \u2014 a former Commerce secretary \u2014 to the assembled good-government types.\n\nThe lineup for the Government Hall of Fame suggests that the magazine, a division of Atlantic Media, is seeking an inclusive and bipartisan slate of names. That\u2019s a laudable goal. The problem relates to the association between good government and Trump appointees: No such relation exists. The Post\u2019s Dana Milbank recently highlighted how the administration\u2019s plan to disperse the Bureau of Land Management is an expression of contempt for functions that crosses agency lines. \u201cWhen your goal is kneecapping the federal government, anything goes,\u201d wrote Milbank.\n\nWhen it comes to governance in the Trump administration, falsehoods are part of the program. In his testimony on the Trump administration\u2019s ambitions to load a citizenship question into the census, Ross alleged that the Justice Department had initiated the request for such a move. The Post\u2019s Salvador Rizzo accorded Ross four Pinocchios for that statement, noting that, in fact, Justice \u201cwas taking its cues from Ross all along.\u201d Writing in the Daily Beast, Jay Michaelson ripped away, \u201cWilbur Ross Lied to Congress About the GOP\u2019s Plot to Rig the Census. This Should Be a National Scandal.\u201d\n\nSo should a lot of Trump-era depravities that fail to impress a scandal-fatigued country. In his book \u201cThe Fifth Risk,\u201d author Michael Lewis disclosed the disgust of a Forbes magazine staffer upon realizing that Ross had been misleading the publication about his wealth. Somehow, noted Dan Alexander, Forbes counted money of his investors as his own for its famous rich list. \u201cHe lucked into a way to be on the list, without deserving to be on the list. But once he gets on the list, he lies. For years.\u201d Ross was among three people who stood out for their efforts to inflate their wealth in the eyes of Forbes, according to Alexander. Another, not surprisingly, was Trump.\n\nWhen we asked about the propriety of allowing Ross within the environs of a good-government event, a rep for Government Executive responded, \u201cWe invited several current and former heads of agencies several months ago to appear at the Government Hall of Fame gala. We included Secretary Ross in that group to help induct former Commerce Secretary Norman Mineta because he is the current secretary and in the spirit of bipartisanship.\u201d\n\nMineta couldn\u2019t be reached for comment on the honor of being feted as an agent of good government by Wilbur Ross.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Can\u2019t weather forecasting be free from politics? Not in the Trump administration.\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Ross\u2019s census sabotage was \u2018arbitrary,\u2019 \u2018capricious\u2019 and \u2018cynical,\u2019 says a federal judge\n\nGeorge F. Will: Wilbur Ross acted wretchedly. But his census decision may be legal.\n\nTom Toles cartoon: Wilbur Ross demands an odd kind of obedience\n\nJane Lubchenco, D. James Baker and Kathryn D. Sullivan: We worked for the NOAA.
