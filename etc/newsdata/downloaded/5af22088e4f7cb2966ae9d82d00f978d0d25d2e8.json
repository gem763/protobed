But the state\u2019s largest power utility is using the lowest of low-tech solutions \u2014 rolling blackouts \u2014 to protect dry landscapes from live power lines that could spark or overheat and set wildfires.\n\nThe utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, turned off power to broad areas, including urban and suburban developments far from the risk of fire, this past week. And the utility had to send some crews into the field to start the blackouts and then restore power \u2014 an antiquated method, energy experts said \u2014 rather than relying on a more centrally controlled operation.\n\nBut there are several rapidly developing types of technology that can reduce the need for some of the most dangerous lines and limit the extent of territory left in the dark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible travesty, this sort of really crude and unsophisticated approach for dealing with what is a very serious issue,\u201d said Jack Brouwer, an engineering professor and director of the National Fuel Cell Research Center at the University of California, Irvine.", "description": "One approach is a microgrid \u2014 creating a small power source that can keep the lights on in a small area when the main grid isn\u2019t working.", "authors": ["James Glanz", "Brad Plumer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/world/12grid-1/12grid-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
