Hill made his presence felt immediately Sunday, making a tremendous, leaping touchdown catch on the Chiefs\u2019 first drive.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nIt took just six plays for Hill to contribute. On third-and-21 from the Houston 46-yard line, Patrick Mahomes lofted a deep pass to Hill.

The Chiefs haven\u2019t missed him too much. The team went 3-1 without Hill, and saw players like Mecole Hardman, Byron Pringle and Demarcus Robinson put up strong numbers.\n\nWhile the Chiefs were able to get by without Hill, his play-making ability can\u2019t be matched. With Mahomes\u2019 propensity to throw it up, Hill should have plenty of chances to show off those skills now that he\u2019s back on the field.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nStory continues\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
