Researchers fear a repeat of conditions in 2015, when hot water was blamed for the death of nearly half of all coral in some island locations. (Sept. 23) AP, AP\n\nKAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) \u2014 Nearly 10% of tsunami warning sirens on Hawaii Island were found to be inoperable during a recent test, officials said.\n\nHawaii County Civil Defense made the determination following an Oct. 1 test of the Big Island\u2019s outdoor warning system, West Hawaii Today reported Sunday.\n\nNine of the 92 sirens installed in communities around the island did not work during the test, Civil Defense Administrator Talmadge Magno said.\n\nEarthquakes around the Pacific are not seasonal and can happen at any time, leaving island residents and visitors at risk. The sirens warn people to move to high ground when an approaching tsunami is detected.\n\nCivil defense sends tsunami alerts via cellphone, but not all areas have reliable service or residents are not registered, officials said.\n\nAn Oct. 1 Civil Defense test found that nine of the 92 tsunami sirens on Hawaii didn't work.

County workers will perform small repairs such as replacing batteries, but the state agency addresses other issues either through contracted work or sending crews from Honolulu, Magno said.\n\nThe Emergency Management Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cOur neighborhood was one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods in the entire state in 2011. I live in an inundation zone. The siren hasn\u2019t worked for months on end,\u201d said Willa Marten, a resident of Napoopoo on the west side of the Big Island.\n\nMarten added: \u201cA functioning warning system is important on an island like ours in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. I see this current failure as part of a bigger picture of our entire infrastructure being neglected.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2019/10/09/hawaii-nearly-10-big-islands-tsunami-sirens-dont-work/3916921002/", "description": "An Oct. 1 test by Civil Defense found that nine of the 92 tsunami sirens on Hawaii's Big Island don't work, West Hawaii Today\u00a0reported.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Published A.M.
