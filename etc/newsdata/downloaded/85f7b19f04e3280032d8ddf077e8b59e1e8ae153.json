Truth told, I have to! Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host Jeopardy! for three more years! So help me. Keep the faith and we\u2019ll win.\"\n\nDespite sharing his diagnosis in March, Trebek powered through the remaining tapings of the 35th season. He even closed out the 50th episode of popular game show with vigor on April 17.\n\nIn a wrap up video posted to YouTube at the time, Trebek thanked his supporters and discussed the status of his therapy and his plans to return for season 36.\n\nLuckily for Trebek, his promises hold true.
