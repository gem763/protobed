We need to unite as a planet.\u201d\n\nAfter winning in a 2015 landslide \u2014 in a repeat of the wave of support that in 1968 carried his late father Pierre to power \u2014 Trudeau\u2019s star has dimmed while in office.\n\nHis image has been tainted by ethics lapses in the handling of the bribery prosecution of an engineering giant, while his campaign was rocked by the emergence of old photographs of him in blackface make-up.\n\nSurging social democrats and resuscitated Quebec separatists have also chipped away at Liberal support.\n\n\u2013 Main parties both struggle \u2013\n\nIf Trudeau hangs on, it will be because Scheer has struggled to win over Canadians with his bland minivan-driving dad persona and a throwback to the thrifty policies of past Tory administrations.\n\nCanadians \u201ccannot afford\u201d a Liberal government propped up by the third-place New Democratic Party (NDP), Scheer said at the end of a marathon last push from the Atlantic to Pacific oceans.\n\n\u201cWe can only imagine what the NDP\u2019s price would be to keep Justin Trudeau in power,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhatever it is, we know Trudeau would pay any price to stay in power and he\u2019d use your money to do it.\u201d\n\nThe first polling stations open at 0830 am (1100 GMT) in Newfoundland, Canada\u2019s most easterly province.\n\nThe 40-day campaign, described by Trudeau as \u201cone of the dirtiest, nastiest\u201d in Canadian history, has been \u201ca desert from a public-policy point of view,\u201d according to pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research.\n\nAttack ads sometimes skirted the truth with accusations that Liberals would legalize hard drugs and the Tories would allow the proliferation of assault weapons.\n\nAt one rally, Trudeau was forced to wear a bulletproof vest.\n\nThe nation\u2019s top bureaucrat earlier this year warned that public discourse had fallen to such a low level that he \u201cworried that somebody is going to be shot\u2026 during the political campaign.\u201d\n\nAlong the bruising way, Trudeau and Scheer traded barbs.\n\nTrudeau evoked the boogeymen of past and current Tory parties fostering \u201cpolitics of fear and division\u201d and Scheer called the prime minister a \u201ccompulsive liar,\u201d \u201ca phoney and a fraud.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Trudeau defends record \u2013\n\nTrudeau defended his record: a strong economy and low unemployment, legal cannabis, the resettlement of 60,000 Syrian refugees, doctor-assisted deaths, a public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women, and free trade deals with Europe, Pacific nations and North American neighbors.\n\nFormer US president Barack Obama chimed in with an endorsement, calling Trudeau an \u201ceffective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world needs his progressive leadership now,\u201d Obama said in a tweet.\n\nThe Conservatives, meanwhile, have stood alone among all of the parties in pledging austerity measures to return to a balanced budget within five years.\n\nScheer found himself on the back foot late in the campaign over revelations of his American dual citizenship and allegations that his party hired a communications firm to \u201cdestroy\u201d the upstart People\u2019s Party, led by former Conservative foreign minister Maxime Bernier.\n\nThe party has situated itself to the right of the Conservatives and could draw votes away.\n\nOn the left, the Bloc has come back from a ruinous 2015 election result, tapping into lingering Quebec nationalism to challenge the Liberals\u2019 dominance in the province.\n\nThe Bloc and NDP have said they would not prop up the Tories if they secure a minority.\n\nPreliminary results across six time zones are expected shortly after 7:00 pm Ottawa time (2300 GMT).\n\nBut with many moving parts in play, who will govern may still be up in the air for several weeks during tricky alliance negotiations that could keep Trudeau in office even if his party loses.", "description": "Ottawa (AFP) \u2013 Canadians vote in a general election Monday with polling predicting a minority government as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/30be80_leader-liberal-party-canada-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-is-on-brink-an-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
