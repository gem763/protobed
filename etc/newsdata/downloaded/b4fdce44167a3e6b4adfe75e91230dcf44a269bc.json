A press release said Biden was in charge for the company's legal affairs with international companies, but Biden has disputed that characterization. At the time, Burisma's founder faced multiple investigations into alleged tax evasion and money laundering.\n\nHunter Biden later stepped down from the board in April 2019 when his term expired.\n\nJoe Biden was part of a larger push coming from former President Obama's administration for the Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin to be removed over concerns of corruption in his office. Biden acted as a vocal opponent of Shokin and has publicly detailed his threat to withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from the country if Shokin wasn't fired.\n\nHowever, it's since been reported that there was not an active investigation into Hunter when the former vice president made the push for Shokin's firing, and Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's prosecutor general, later said that he had no evidence of wrongdoing against either Biden.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have been pushing a narrative suggesting that the Biden's were involved in corruption", "description": "Controversy has brewed for months among former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, Ukrainian authorities, Rudy Giuliani, and Trump.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/LFd3LClFFpL2xK4LPazmzw--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/f74f16cc96d829a9238dd23a85bec7ea", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
