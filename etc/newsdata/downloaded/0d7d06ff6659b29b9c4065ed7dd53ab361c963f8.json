REUTERS/Johanna Geron\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence former leader Carles Puigdemont said on Tuesday that a Brussels court had postponed to Dec. 16 a hearing on an arrest warrant from Spain for his extradition.\n\nPuigdemont went into self-imposed exile in Brussels after Catalonia made a failed independence bid in October 2017, when he headed the region\u2019s government, and has lived there since.\n\nSpain, which previously failed to have Puigdemont extradited, renewed the attempt after its Supreme Court this month sentenced nine other separatist leaders to up to 13 years in jail for their role in the events of 2017.\n\nSpain\u2019s acting deputy prime minister, Carmen Calvo, said on Tuesday her government would not understand if Belgium decided not to hand over Puigdemont.\n\n\u201cAs we see it, it is not respectable for this to be denied to a democratic state after the Supreme Court sentence,\u201d she told broadcaster Onda Cero,\n\nCatalonia made a short-lived declaration of independence following the referendum, which Spanish authorities had declared illegal.\n\nA lawyer for Puigdemont, Simon Bekaert, said the legal arguments remained the same as they were just after the 2017 independence bid, when Spain put out the previous warrant for Puigdemont\u2019s arrest, which Belgium rejected.\n\n\u201cWe will of course invoke immunity,\u201d Bekaert said.", "description": "Catalonia's pro-independence former leader Carles Puigdemont said on Tuesday that a Brussels court had postponed to Dec. 16 a hearing on an arrest warrant from Spain for his extradition.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446135463&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S0LK", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
