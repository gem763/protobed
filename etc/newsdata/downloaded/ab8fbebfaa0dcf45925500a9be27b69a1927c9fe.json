All the president had to do was read a straightforward statement \u2013 which the White House had 12 hours to prepare \u2013 announcing the demise of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS.\n\nThe development was unambiguously good news, a boost for U.S. counter-terrorism efforts, and cause for congratulations for all involved. It was also an opportunity for Trump to act like a president, if only for a few minutes, with remarks that could\u2019ve helped define his term.\n\nBut as is too often the case, Trump lacked the wherewithal to restrain his worst instincts. During a rambling 48-minute appearance, the Republican used a tone one might expect on a playground; he needlessly shared sensitive operational details; he made multiple canine references for reasons that were not at all clear; he took the time to praise a far-right media network; he made self-aggrandizing claims for no reason; and Trump lied rather brazenly about his own record.\n\nConsider this head-shaking moment, in which the president referred to ISIS leaders:\n\n\u201cYou know, these people are very smart. They\u2019re not into the use of cellphones anymore. They\u2019re not \u2013 they\u2019re very technically brilliant. You know, they use the Internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump. But they use the Internet incredibly well. \u201cAnd what they\u2019ve done with the Internet, through recruiting and everything \u2013 and that\u2019s why he died like a dog, he died like a coward.\u201d\n\nYou could almost see the wheels turning in Trump\u2019s mind, as he started to marvel at how impressed he was with himself, before realizing that he should at least try to stick to the topic at hand.\n\nAfter insisting that al-Baghdadi\u2019s death is more significant that Osama bin Laden\u2019s \u2013 a dubious assertion, to be sure \u2013 viewers were treated to this Trump ridiculous gem:\n\n\u201cYou know, if you read my book \u2013 there was a book just before the World Trade Center came down. And I don\u2019t get any credit for this, but that\u2019s okay. I never do. But here we are. I wrote a book \u2013 a, really, very successful book. And in that book, about a year before the World Trade Center was blown up, I said, \u2018There is somebody named Osama bin Laden. You better kill him or take him out.\u2019 Something to that effect. \u2018He\u2019s big trouble.\u2019\n\n\u201cNow, I wasn\u2019t in government. I was building buildings and doing what I did. But I always found it fascinating. But I saw this man \u2013 tall, handsome, very charismatic \u2013 making horrible statements about wanting to destroy our country. And I\u2019m writing a book. I think I wrote 12 books. All did very well. And I\u2019m writing a book. The World Trade Center had not come down. I think it was about \u2013 if you check, it was about a year before the World Trade Center came down. And I\u2019m saying to people, \u2018Take out Osama bin Laden,\u2019 that nobody ever heard of. Nobody ever heard of. I mean, al-Baghdadi everybody hears because he\u2019s built this monster for a long time. But nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until, really, the World Trade Center.\n\n\u201cBut about a year \u2013 you\u2019ll have to check \u2013 a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, \u2018You have to kill him. You have to take him out.\u2019 Nobody listened to me.\n\n\u201cAnd to this day, I get people coming up to me, and they said, \u2018You know what one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve ever seen about you? Is that you predicted that Osama bin Laden had to be killed before he knocked down the World Trade Center.\u2019 It\u2019s true. Now, most of the press doesn\u2019t want to write that, but you know \u2013 but it is true. If you go back, look at my book. I think it was \u2018The America We Deserve.\u2019 I made a prediction, and I \u2013 let\u2019s put it this way: If they would have listened to me, a lot of things would have been different.\u201d\n\nPutting aside questions of propriety \u2013 this was not an occasion in which Trump was supposed to talk about how awesome he considers his awesomeness \u2013 none of this was even close to being true. Trump\u2019s book made no predictions about bin Laden, who was well known in national security circles long before the publication of his book.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the insinuation that 9/11 could\u2019ve been prevented if only more people \u201cwould have listened\u201d to Donald Trump was as obscene as it was wrong.\n\nDuring the same event, the president also once again claimed that he opposed the 2003 Iraq war, which remains one of his favorite lies, despite the fact that the claim has been repeatedly debunked.\n\nThe larger concern, however, isn\u2019t that Trump was caught peddling nonsense \u2013 an unfortunate daily occurrence \u2013 it was the circumstances in which he did so. This was supposed to be a moment of triumph. It could\u2019ve been a unifying moment for the president and his constituents to be proud of.\n\nBut as Americans were reminded yesterday, Trump just can\u2019t help himself.", "description": "This was supposed to be a moment of triumph.
