They're becoming more and more the trusted advisors to small and medium sized businesses and even enterprises in terms of providing advice on what companies need to look for in terms of IT products and services,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"These non-traditional providers don't have an IT background, but they can partner with solutions providers like ourselves to provide the implementation services and ongoing support needed to their customers.\"\n\nRhipe's consulting practice will compete with Telstra's new business unit Purple Consulting and Professional Services.\n\nMr Nolan said its solutions business currently made up 20 per cent of its revenue, but he expected it to make up a larger chunk going forward.\n\n\"There's a significant amount of investment going towards it. We're expanding the team to provide the services we create demand for and we've enhanced all the divisions in terms of the internal resources,\" he said.\n\n\"My vision is to be the leading channel-driven professional services solution provider across the Asia Pacific. There's no reason why we couldn't deliver these services across the 17 countries we're in,\" he said.", "description": "Cloud software distributor Rhipe believes its solutions business will make up a larger chunk of its revenue in the coming years.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3028%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_758%2C$y_176/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7ebfbe14f1abae9848b5f0bc48593110e6cbf6ce", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
