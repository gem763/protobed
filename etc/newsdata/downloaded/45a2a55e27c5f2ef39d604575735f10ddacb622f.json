(AP) - Changes demanded by California\u2019s governor as a condition of signing a vaccine bill cleared their first hurdle Monday, but action in the Senate was delayed as protesters shouted and pounded on the walls and door.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom sought the changes as a condition of signing previously approved legislation intended to crack down on doctors who sell fraudulent medical exemptions.\n\nThe Assembly approved the measure with a 43-14 vote and the Senate was expected to take up the bill later in the day.\n\nHowever, Senate action was delayed for more than 90 minutes as protesters pounded on the walls and door, unfurled an upside-down American flag from the public gallery in a traditional signal of distress, and chanted \u201cMy kids, my choice\u201d and \u201cWe will not comply.\u201d\n\nAn apparent counter-protester unfurled a black banner reading: \u201cWe the People v. the Vaccine Extremists.\u201d\n\nThe two bills are needed \u201cso we can keep children safe from preventable diseases,\u201d Democratic Assemblyman Jim Wood of Santa Rosa.\n\nRepublican Assemblyman Devon Mathis of Visalia objected that there were no committee hearings on the last-minute bill.\n\n\u201cThis goes past vaccines and is again a major government overreach,\u201d Mathis said, adding that, \u201cOur medically fragile children are what are at stake.\u201d\n\nNewsom demanded a phase-out period for medical exemptions similar to one allowed when California eliminated personal belief vaccine exemptions in 2015. A kindergartener with an exemption could retain it through 6th grade, for instance, while a 7th grader could be exempted through high school.\n\nThe companion bill also would allow officials to revoke any medical exemptions written by a doctor who has faced disciplinary action.\n\nThe bill would make it clear that enforcement will start next year, meaning doctors who previously granted a high number of medical exemptions won\u2019t face scrutiny.\n\nSeveral opponents of the bill, including two women who briefly chained themselves to an outside doorway, were detained before the legislative session as they blocked entrances to the Capitol.\n\nAbout 200 others filled the hallway in front of the governor\u2019s office, asking Newsom to veto both vaccine bills.\n\nOne woman sobbed in the gallery as senators caucused before voting on the bill, while another sang \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d\n\nAbout 200 opponents earlier filled the hallway in front of the governor\u2019s office, asking Newsom to veto both vaccine bills. They later chanted \u201cWhere is Newsom?\u201d and \u201cVeto the bill\u201d from the Senate gallery before leaving when they were threatened with being arrested for an unlawful protest.\n\nThey returned to the Assembly, where they continued shouting \u201cKill the bill\u201d and \u201cProtect our children\u201d as lawmakers considered other legislation.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Adam Beam contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Changes demanded by California's governor as a condition of signing a vaccine bill cleared their first hurdle Monday, but action in the Senate was delayed as protesters shouted and pounded on the walls and door.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Don Thompson"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
