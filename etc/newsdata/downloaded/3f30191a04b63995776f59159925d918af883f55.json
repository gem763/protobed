Diana Diroy\n\nFor locals, snake is familiar and expected, a natural part of their diet. For foreigners, it's perhaps the ultimate foodie thrill ride.\n\nBut Van Duc's snake dishes draw on Vietnamese culture and flavors -- helpful in getting fearful diners to give it a try. The intrepid traveler preparing to taste snake for the first time may be comforted by the familiar aroma and taste of fresh basil, fish sauce and garlic.\n\nHowever this doesn't apply to the fresh snake heart, one-bite dish reserved for the truly adventurous, non-squeamish eater.\n\nThe rest of the dishes at Van Duc are served family style and considerably more palatable. There's no printed menu and restaurant staff speak limited English so can't explain much about the cooking styles.\n\nBut use your nose and you'll get a whiff of chilies and coriander, while dishes cooked in a hot, oil-coated wok smell smoky and rich.\n\nInteractive dining\n\nSnake sauteed with morning glory is one of the restaurant's most popular dishes. Diana Diroy\n\nThe menu-free experience at Van Duc means diners get to choose which snake is going to end up on their table.\n\nThere's no rule that says you have to watch the snake meet its timely death, but witnessing the expert handler navigate his way around the slithering, hissing creature does add to the experience.\n\nOnce the snake is cut and killed it's ushered into the vast kitchen, where it's chopped, sliced and ground, its bones pulverized, and its skin cut into strips for a quick fry.\n\nAlong with the blood wine and bile, served immediately, diners can order a local beer. There's no shame in needing a little liquid courage to propel you through the meal.\n\nFrom blood to bile\n\nLemongrass, an ingredient found in many traditional Vietnamese meals, shows up in a few of the snake dishes at Van Duc. Stacey Lastoe/CNN\n\nIt's not just the reptile's meaty flesh but its bones and skin, as well as the aforementioned blood and bile, that comprise a meal at Van Duc, where servings are generous.\n\nThe entire snake is used to create a plethora of dishes -- a cobra at Van Duc can feed about 6-8 people for $60 -- meaning it's actually a budget-friendly night out.\n\nSnake spring rolls are filled with ground reptile meat and served piping hot after spending a minute in a sizzling oil-filled wok. These are tasty, fresh with herbs found in all Vietnamese cuisine.\n\nThere's also snake meat wrapped in LaLot leaves, a kind of green that's neither bitter nor bland.\n\nLong says one of the most popular dishes is sauteed snake meat -- perhaps because its texture is the closest thing to poultry or pork -- though he maintains that snake can't really be likened to either.\n\nHe's right. Snake is its own beast. (Pun intended.)\n\nIt can also be poisonous. Long admits guests sometimes express apprehension about this.\n\n\"We tell them truthfully that, from the beginning until now, there have been no cases of allergic reactions or poisonings after eating snakes,\" he says.\n\nLong then smiles, gestures around the leafy green outdoor terrace where the boisterous backpackers are coaxing their buddy to eat the raw heart, and says guests trust the restaurant.\n\n\"The snake meat is very special,\" he says.\n\nGetting there\n\nA visit to Le Mat Village is special not just because of the reptiles but also its location, far from the tourist trail. After a couple days of dodging motorbikes and eager vendors in the Old Quarter, this side trip may feel like a welcome break.\n\nTo get there, rent a motorbike yourself or take a taxi to Nguyen Van Duc, about a 15-20 minute ride from the center of town.", "description": "Hungry parties in Hanoi, Vietnam, can order the cobra, but diners with more moderate appetites will probably want to select a smaller snake from Nguyen Van Duc, a popular restaurant in Le Mat -- aka \"Snake Village.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1200/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F191009145600-01-snake-village-hanoi-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
