Often it\u2019s not a matter of creeping in, parliaments have been warned,\" he says.\n\n\"As to why it\u2019s happened, I think the sense of self-restraint our politicians have had in this area has dissipated.\"\n\nIn June this year came the straws that broke the camel's back.\n\nOn June 4, the Australian Federal Police raided the home of News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst over an April 2018 story revealing concerns among the government about a top secret proposal to expand the role of the Australian Signals Directorate.\n\nThe police spent six hours in Smethurst's home in Canberra. The following day, the AFP raided the Ultimo, Sydney headquarters of the ABC over a 2017 story regarding accusations of war crimes by Australian special forces in Afghanistan, naming Dan Oakes and Sam Clark on the warrant.\n\nA parliamentary inquiry was instituted following police raids on journalists in June and the prospect ABC and News Corp journalists may end up in jail. David Rowe\n\nThe ABC later discovered, under the Freedom of Information Act, that the head of the Department of Home Affairs, Mike Pezzullo, had congratulated the AFP on the raids.\n\n\"Good work by all involved. I also received a call this evening from the Sec DHA [Secretary of the Department of Home Affairs, Pezzullo] who is fully supportive of the actions of the AFP and ask [sic] me to pass on my [sic] thanks to the team involved,\" AFP deputy commissioner Neil Gaughan said in a staff email.\n\n\"Well done \u2014 tomorrow is another day.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGovernment ministers and officials have refused to rule out pursuing charges against Smethurst, Oakes and Clark.\n\nThese raids galvanised the incredibly competitive and often bitchy media industry, culminating in the launch of Monday's press freedom political and editorial campaign.\n\nThe Right to Know coalition includes Australian Associated Press, the ABC, Australian Community Media, ASTRA, Bauer Media, Commercial Radio Australia, Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, Daily Mail, Free TV, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, News Corp Australia, Nine, Prime Media, Seven West Media, Sky News, SBS, Ten, Guardian Australia and Win Network.\n\nThe front pages of Australia's major newspapers on Monday morning. Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe coalition is focused on six key areas where reform is required. These include the right to contest warrants, protections for whistleblowers, new rules on what information can be deemed secret, freedom-of-information reform, exemptions to protect journalists doing their jobs in the public interest from prosecution, and defamation law reform.\n\nThe government's response until Monday had been to set up a Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry into the exercise of law enforcement and intelligence powers in relation to press freedom.\n\nAustralia's top spies were asked to weigh in on press freedom in Australia. The result, somewhat ironically and a bit depressingly, says much about the default mindset that permeates government and public service ranks.\n\nASIO's submission to a parliamentary inquiry was classified as secret and not released publicly, unlike the rest of the submissions.\n\nThe farcical nature of the exercise was heavily criticised - cue irony again - by the media, whereupon the document was declassified and made available to the public.\n\nThe 15-page document was vanilla.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A greater culture of secrecy has grown up around government information. They\u2019ve felt somewhat emboldened in their abilities to resist,\" UNSW's Williams says.\n\nEarlier this month, SBS chief political correspondent Brett Mason revealed a freedom-of-information request regarding the cost of Defence Industry Minister Melissa Price's recent trip to Europe.\n\nMason was granted the information. But only at a cost of $2,515 - made up of $1,940 for 92 hours of decision-making (the first five hours were free) and $675 for 45 hours of searching and retrieval.\n\nThe veteran journalist disputed the charge, and it now turns out the information will be made public for free.\n\n\"Examples like this show how government departments are acting against the letter of these laws and the spirit of them,\" Mason says.\n\n\"You can understand we can\u2019t have access to all documents in all circumstances, [but] I think the law is very clear we can have access to most documents in most circumstances.\"\n\nAFP officers leave the ABC headquarters in Ultimo after the June raid. Wolter Peeters\n\nMarking documents as classified, redacting information to the point of essentially blacking out a page, or simply making them expensive to access has become the go-to mindset for politicians and public servants, who seem, in many cases, to be seeking to avoid embarrassment rather than protect national security.\n\nRoutine stonewalling may not grab the headlines in the way an AFP raid does, but it illuminates a cover-up culture geared towards avoiding scrutiny of people and organisations that are ultimately paid for by the Australian taxpayer.\n\nThe government's response to the media's demands has been lukewarm and sceptical. With more than 75 laws passed since 2001 - the year of the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington - successive governments have failed to strike a balance between freedom of the press and anti-terrorism and national security legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"They\u2019re just not required to give way to press freedom. We\u2019re the sole democracy in the world that lacks a bill of rights,\" Williams says.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday no one should be asking for a leave pass to be above the law. \"That includes me, or any journalist, or anyone else.\"\n\nAttorney-General Christian Porter has labelled as unrealistic the demands of the Right to Know coalition, while saying he would step in to prevent the prosecution of journalists should the AFP recommend it.\n\nHowever, that puts journalists in the position of being presumed guilty for doing their jobs.\n\nMedia companies argue the legal system recognises special relationships such as parliamentary privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality, and this should extend to public-interest journalism.\n\nThe intimidation of journalists via the AFP raids is already percolating beyond the government and public service, into the arena of corporate Australia.\n\nThe group executive editor of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, James Chessell, told a parliamentary inquiry in August people were thinking twice about coming forward with information for fear of retribution.\n\n\"When the raids occurred, Adele Ferguson, one of our better-known investigative reporters, was dealing with a whistleblower who wanted to expose the cosy relationship between the auditor EY and National Australia Bank \u2013 a story that has already resulted in a parliamentary inquiry,\" Chessell told the politicians.\n\n\"Adele said, quote, 'the whistleblower freaked out' when the raids happened and almost decided not to go ahead.\"\n\nFerguson's dogged reporting, over many years, of the gross misdeeds of the banking sector was a catalyst for the financial services royal commission.\n\nMonday's campaign launch has so far seen traction. The media industry argues there is a desperate need for holistic reform, but the Coalition government has little desire to be perceived as weakening on national security.\n\nBut the consequence is an ill-informed public. Without journalism, and without whistleblowers brave enough to come forward, an important check on power is weakened. Royal commissions into the banking industry, aged care and child sexual abuse are harder to get up in the absence of press freedom and protections for those coming forward with crucial information.\n\n\"If we keep finding our ability to report important information further constricted and then the legal threats continue to be so high while publishers all over the world are struggling financially, the end result is you get gun-shy journalists, you get gun-shy editors and you get unrestrained potential abuses of power at the top of our society,\" investigative reporter Richard Baker says.\n\n\"I don't think anyone would say that's a healthy place or a healthy way to be.\"", "description": "A democracy cannot be healthy when journalists and whistleblowers feel as intimidated as they do now.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5714%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_140/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0e7cb8d7dcc42183c5d6a43af34c4e66b509bcc3", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
