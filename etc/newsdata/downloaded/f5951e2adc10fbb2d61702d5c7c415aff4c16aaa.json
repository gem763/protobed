But male-dominated screening panels and gender-biased questions make it tough for women to land that all-important internship\n\nAny one of us could probably recall a depressing \u201cwomen in tech\u201d headline. Wise (Women in Science and Engineering) says that 23% of the people working in Stem roles in the UK are female, while PwC states that just 5% of leadership positions in the technology industry are held by women. In a sample of 1,000 US consumers by LivePerson, a US software company, only 8.3% could name a famous woman in tech; that fell to just 4% when LivePerson discounted any responses naming Siri or Alexa.\n\nHowever things are changing for women in tech, says Anna Brailsford, CEO at Code First: Girls, which works with companies and women to increase the numbers of women in tech. \u201cMany established companies have made bold commitments to hiring a more balanced workforce,\u201d she says. \u201cSome have gone as far as committing to a 50:50 split.\u201d\n\nBut how will they do this when there are simply more qualified male candidates in the sector? One way is to poach workers with some relevant skills from other companies and develop them internally. The second is to invest money into talent earlier, at the graduate recruitment stage, or before they enter the workforce at internship stage.\n\nYet even at internship stage, there are raised flags about gender discrimination.\n\n\u201cInternships at popular technology companies are hyper-competitive and frequently awarded to those who have completed two years at university,\u201d says Brailsford. \u201cCurrently, there is a disproportionate focus on computer science degrees, mainly because it is one of the few degree disciplines that will actually teach students how to code in some capacity. When we ask women what is inhibiting them from applying for an internship, they will often say entry requirements.\u201d\n\nAccording to recruitment organisation Stem Women, the percentage of women graduating in computer science in 2016-17 was just 15%.\n\nRituja Rao was a journalism student who wanted to get some work experience before venturing into a career in tech. \u201cI was sending out 50 applications a week, tweeting and emailing people for a weeklong shadowing or internship experience, but I found nothing,\u201d she says, \u201cI just wanted to get an insight before committing to a Stem degree, but I got turned down for any beginner opportunities.\u201d\n\nEventually she was hired by London-based tech consultant Sparta Global, who took her on despite her non-technical background. \u201cDiversity and inclusion are beyond what meets the eye,\u201d says Rao. \u201cAs a young girl, I just didn\u2019t think of Stem as a career, and I carried that with me into my adult life, because I felt that I didn\u2019t have what it needs.\u201d\n\nYet the tech industry depends on more young women to diversify its heavily male workforce. \u201cTeaching them to code is one step, but getting them through the interview process for industry opportunities is another,\u201d says Sparta Global\u2019s diversity and inclusion lead, Gaia Caruso. \u201cMany young women express a fear of coming across as \u2018cocky\u2019 or \u2018demanding\u2019 in the workplace, particularly if they are working in a temporary intern position.\u201d\n\nThe perception is that their appointment is a box-ticking exercise, says Caruso. \u201cYes, many companies promote diverse workforces, but they don\u2019t represent this with their interview panels.\u201d\n\nBrailsford believes that many internships are still too hyper-competitive \u201cand appear to value attributes more often associated with men\u201d. We all accept that internships are a kind of extended job interview. \u201cIn my experience, internships that value teamwork, authenticity and project-based outcomes over competition and constant hard code testing stand a much better chance of creating an environment in which young women thrive.\u201d\n\nThe tech companies have a job to do, Caruso suggests: \u201cWhen promoting internships, use gender-neutral job descriptions to reduce impostor syndrome among women looking to enter a male-dominated industry. When screening potential interns, use diverse hiring panels, remove gender-biased interview questions, and actively report diversity and inclusion for hiring. When interns are on site, don\u2019t allow your commitment to promoting a culture of gender-equality slide. Continued mentorship opportunities during internship experiences are also undervalued.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, companies are opting for sponsored education programmes in place of internships. Code First: Girls is partnering with a number of companies to co-create and deliver bespoke, company-accredited coding programmes for women. This, Brailsford says, offers companies the opportunity to invest in women from a wide variety of backgrounds, \u201cnot just those that have taken a coveted computer science degree\u201d.\n\n\u201cOne common problem all women in tech face is peers treating women as if they\u2019re not as knowledgeable or experienced as male colleagues,\u201d says Lauren Allison, CEO of online course provider #techmums, \u201cand I\u2019m sure that is compounded for women in learning positions such as placements or internships.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cIt\u2019s appalling that it\u2019s 2019 and the small changes in statistics are seen as the situation \u2018getting better\u2019. There\u2019s still a long way to go and the pace of change is disappointing. \u2018Getting better\u2019 isn\u2019t good enough, and things need to change at a grassroots level.\u201d\n\nBut for intern Lauren Ward the changes are being felt. She\u2019s in the third year of her PhD and is interning in the audio team at BBC Research & Development at MediaCityUK in Salford. \u201cThe industry is still male dominated, but the fact that my PhD student cohort is currently female dominated indicates it might be shifting,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom the different organisations I\u2019ve worked for, I\u2019ve seen that a lot of the things necessary to support all different types of people pursuing a technical career are already in place, such as flexible working, a focus on good mental health in the workplace, and establishing good work-life balance.\u201d\n\nCaruso says companies and individuals who follow this advice will reap the benefits: \u201cA community of women who feel supported and treated fairly is the most effective PR tool to inspire future women in tech.\u201d", "description": "Male-dominated screening panels and gender-biased questions make it tough for female interns to land that all-important internship", "authors": ["Hazel Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/229b46ca65c48f471ed12cc49809549a40cd3de5/0_0_4600_2760/master/4600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=25dccb1c4814bc27207faa5108848948", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
