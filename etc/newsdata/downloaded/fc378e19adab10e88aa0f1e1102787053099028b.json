However, Chinese tech giant Tencent is trying something different \u2013 embedding the ad into an object right within the video you\u2019re watching.\n\nFor instance, if an actor is holding a cup of coffee, you\u2019ll see an ad on the cup. Check out the mindblowing video below posted by Matthew Brannan,an analyst who focuses on Chinese companies.\n\nWow! Worth watching this. China's largest video platform #Tencentvideo (97M paying China subscribers) will begin inserting extra ads into movies/series that didn't exist in the original. #computervision pic.twitter.com/qltsQz9jdF \u2014 Matthew Brennan (@mbrennanchina) October 15, 2019\n\nTencent has partnered with a computer vision and AI company Mirriad to execute this project. The company says it will be able to deliver ads without interrupting the viewing experience.\n\nFor now, Tencent will test this out on its own video platform. However, if this experiment is successful, more video platforms might be eager to adopt the new tech. It\u2019s not clear at the moment if these ads are clickable. We\u2019ve contacted Mirriad for more details, and we\u2019ll update the story if we hear back.\n\nAs Brennan rightly pointed out in a tweet, ad blockers will have a tough time catching and blocking these ads. Be prepared to see a lot of hidden brand partnerships in movies in the near future.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FTencent-ads.jpg&signature=dcbaa87303fcc4595f910b894293ae9b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
