He hopes to see his revised Brexit deal with Brussels receive parliamentary approval this week.\n\nGoldman\u2019s strategists predict the deal could get pushed through parliament on either Monday or Tuesday, and that the pound has \u201cfurther to rally on a \u2018deal\u2019 outcome.\u201d The new forecast raises the bank\u2019s prior bullish stance that saw the pound reaching $1.30.\n\nOpinion: Johnson lost again. But his Brexit deal is likely to succeed\n\nPandl and the team said initial disappointment over Saturday\u2019s vote would probably weigh on the pound, but that would dissipate as a Brexit deal has been \u201cdeferred, not denied.\u201d In early trading Monday, the pound was trimming its losses, last down 0.3% to $1.2931. The currency pair is still trading at the highest level seen since May.\n\nGoldman admitted there is a risk that Johnson\u2019s deal may ultimately fail to pass, which would push the pound back to $1.26.\n\n\u201cWe do not expect a return to the low 1.20s given the high likelihood of an extension. Second, MPs may amend the deal and surrounding legislation to include either a second referendum, membership of a customs union, or fresh elections,\u201d the strategists said, adding that they don\u2019t think any of those would succeed.\n\nRead: So what\u2019s next after the U.K. parliament\u2019s non-vote on Brexit?\n\n\u201cA successful amendment for an election is the main risk for GBP downside in our view, although with both sides of politics are likely to be offering equivalent or softer forms of Brexit. The crucial conclusion is that \u2018no deal\u2019 risk is unlikely to increase meaningfully, capping the downside for the pound,\u201d said Goldman.", "description": "The pound could surge to $1.35 on fading prospects of a no-deal Brexit has now faded, Goldman Sachs predicted.", "authors": ["Barbara Kollmeyer", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HN503_Sterli_ZG_20190717071511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
