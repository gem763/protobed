China's domestic market is expected to leapfrog the United States and Western Europe to become the largest aviation hub, while India and new manufacturing markets like Vietnam are growing the fastest.\n\nBut the industry also faces a squall of new pressures from trade tensions, the partial unwinding of globalisation and an anti-flying campaign from climate activists, notably in Europe.\n\n\"Increased protectionism and other geopolitical risks remain a concern,\" Airbus said in its Global Market Forecast.\n\nAdding to that worry is a weak freight market this year.\n\nAddressing an increasingly vocal debate on emissions, in a week that Swedish teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg pressed the U.S. Congress for action on climate change, Airbus said the industry could still achieve carbon-neutral growth while connecting more people due to more efficient planes.\n\nEnvironmental groups backing a global \"climate strike\" say more radical steps are needed to meet such goals.\n\nAirbus revised up its demand forecast for the industry's most-sold single-aisle jets by 4% to 29,720 planes but cut the medium segment including its A330neo by 2% to 5,370.\n\nIt followed U.S. rival Boeing in scrapping separate forecasts for the world's largest four-engined aircraft such as the Airbus A380 or Boeing 747. Airbus decided in February halt production of the double-decker A380 due to weak demand.\n\nIt now includes these aircraft with the largest twin-engined jets, with the resulting combined category up 22% to 4,120 jets.\n\nAirbus raised its 20-year forecast for after-sales services like maintenance, pilot training and cabin upgrades to $4.9 trillion from $4.6 trillion.\n\nOnce focused mainly on building and delivering their jets, Airbus, Boeing and other plane manufacturers are stepping up competition with their own suppliers and customers for a slice of this market, which is driven by the size of the global fleet.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Editing by Deepa Babington)", "description": "Airbus said it now expects airlines and leasing companies to take delivery of 39,210 new passenger jets and freighters over the next two decades compared to 37,389 previously forecast.
