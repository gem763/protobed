Kevin McCarthy of California, defended the White House decision to \u201clock down\u201d the details of Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy by putting it on a separate computer system.\n\n\u201cCould I see why you\u2019d want to put it on a more secure server?\u201d McCarthy asked. \u201cI think in the world of technology today, yeah, people should secure what\u2019s going forward.\u201d The defense of the separate computer system at the White House was striking for Republicans who joined Trump in pursuing information on Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state.\n\nYet while some Republicans defended the president, there were signs of concern in the restraint being shown by others.\n\n\u201cI take it very seriously,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\nThe complaint released Thursday morning alleges that Trump abused the power of his office to \u201csolicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in next year\u2019s U.S. election. Trump has denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIn the 9-page complaint, the unnamed whistleblower acknowledges not hearing the president\u2019s call first-hand, but says he or she received information about it from \u201cmultiple U.S. officials.\u201d\n\nMuch of what the whistleblower recounts from the president\u2019s July 25 call tracks with a transcript released Wednesday by the White House.\n\nTrump and Republicans have raised doubts about the whistleblower.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to make too quick of a conclusion when you\u2019re reading something that somebody heard somebody else say second-hand or third-hand.\u201d\n\nPelosi said the information about the president\u2019s call \u201cremoved all doubt that we should move forward.\u201d The president, she said, \u201cbetrayed his oath of office, our national security and the integrity of our elections.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Pelosi read from the complaint, which\u00a0alleges the White House tried to \"lock down\" details\u00a0of Trump's call with Ukraine's new president.", "authors": ["Lisa Mascaro", "Laurie Kellman"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/nancy-pelosi.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
