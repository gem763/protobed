REUTERS/Charles Platiau/Files\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Publicis (PUBP.PA) tumbled on Friday to their lowest level in more than seven years after the world\u2019s third-biggest advertising company cut its full-year sales target again.\n\nThe change in company guidance reflected yet again the hardships that traditional ad groups face, with revenues being squeezed by competition from Facebook (FB.O) and Google (GOOGL.O) as well as tightening budgets by major clients.\n\nPublicis was down 13% in early trading on Friday, also dragging down the shares of British rival WPP (WPP.L). Publicis was at its lowest level since July 2012.\n\nInvestment banks Macquarie and Societe Generale both cut their recommendations on Publicis, with SocGen cutting Publicis to \u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201d.\n\nLate on Thursday, Publicis, which competes against bigger rivals WPP and Omnicom (OMC.N), said it now expected sales to fall by about 2.5% on an underlying basis, compared to a previous outlook of \u201cbroadly stable net revenue\u201d.\n\nPublicis Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun, who succeeded company veteran and current chairman Maurice Levy in 2017, has promised to offset the decline in ad spending by steering the business closer to consultancy groups.\n\nHe is also aiming to offer clients technological tools on top of traditional creative marketing campaigns, but the strategy is taking more time than expected to bear fruit.\n\n\u201cThere is significant long-term value in Publicis in our view, since we remain confident in the agency model and adaptability, but the company-specific string of revenues misses implies a longer normalisation phase than we had expected,\u201d SocGen analysts wrote in a note.", "description": "Shares in Publicis tumbled on Friday to their lowest level in more than seven years after the world's third-biggest advertising company cut its full-year sales target again.", "authors": ["Sudip Kar-Gupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439599673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0KM", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
