All the padding is in the back of his f****** glove. Look at that s***.\n\n\ud83d\udc41\ufe0fTyson Fury's sparring partner Nicholas Asberry claims Fury removes padding from his gloves to hurt sparring partners.

There\u2019s s*** falling out from the middle of the glove.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFury\u2019s trainer, Ben Davison, as well as cutman Jorge Capetillo, have denied the claims and now the lineal champion himself has spoken out, rubbishing Asberry\u2019s allegations.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve not seen any videos so I don\u2019t know what everyone\u2019s going on about, but I\u2019ve heard something about gloves, that I\u2019ve taken padding out of gloves,\u2019 Fury told IFL TV.\n\n\u2018For who? For Nicholas Asberry?! Please! Have a day off will you! Have a day off and have two off please on Sundays.\n\n\u2018So you think me at 30 fights, unbeaten for 11 years or whatever, is going to take some padding out of gloves to punch up a sparring partner who\u2019s a bum anyway? Very unlikely.\u2019\n\nAsberry doubled down on his accusation in an interview with World Boxing News, saying: \u2018I contacted them and they told me they would compensate me after the Wilder fight. They tried to talk me down and say they didn\u2019t do anything to the gloves.\n\nFury sparred with Asberry before his fight with Deontay Wilder last December (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018So, let\u2019s say the possibility is that they didn\u2019t. But as soon as I picked up the glove the inside was falling out. You could manipulate the part of the glove that makes contact with its target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I showed in my screenshot conversations that they knew Tyson was sparring with gloves that were, to their account \u201cdodgy\u201d. The gloves just didn\u2019t have all of the paddings in there. They also had weird marks on the outside of the glove that showed it was in contact with something other than what it was made for.\u2019", "description": "Tyson Fury has dismissed the suggestion he took padding out of his gloves during sparring after Nicholas Asberry made the astonishing claim.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11768181931_1572076728.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
