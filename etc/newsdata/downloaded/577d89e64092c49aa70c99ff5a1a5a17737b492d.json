He recorded five strikeouts and walked one.\n\nNationals reliever Sean Doolittle, filling in for Daniel Hudson as the team\u2019s closer, replaced Sanchez in the eighth and notched a four-out save. Doolittle took over the ninth-inning role due to Hudson being placed on the paternity list ahead of Game 1.\n\nWashington took a 1-0 lead in the second after catcher Yan Gomes doubled to deep left-center field to score Kendrick.\n\nLater in the seventh inning, Kendrick singled to center and plated Adam Eaton to boost the Nationals\u2019 lead to 2-0.\n\nKendrick, who has tallied at least one hit in every postseason game this year except Game 1 of the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, was 2-for-4 with an RBI and a walk. The veteran second baseman punched Washington\u2019s ticket to the NLCS with a grand slam in Game 5 against the Dodgers.\n\nCardinals starter Miles Mikolas, who was credited with the loss, allowed one earned run on seven hits across six innings. He notched seven strikeouts and walked two.\n\nGame 2 of the NLCS is Saturday at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.", "description": "Oct. 11 (UPI) \u2014 Anibal Sanchez took a no-hitter into the eighth inning and Howie Kendrick\u2019s bat remained hot as the Washington Nationals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
