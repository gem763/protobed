People send them in from all over the world \u2013 plastic applicators polluting the environment, blue, orange, green, purple and yellow.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a rainbow of plastic pollution,\u201d says Daish, 27, a campaigner seeking to persuade companies and governments to remove plastics from women\u2019s sanitary products. \u201cThis is a global issue, but period products aren\u2019t talked about much; they need to be stopped at source.\u201d\n\nSanitary products are the fifth most common item found on Europe\u2019s beaches, more widespread than single-use coffee cups, cutlery or straws. Some 200,000 tonnes of material is believed to end up in UK landfill every year. The water engineer Hazem Gouda has estimated that 700,000 panty liners, 2.5m tampons and 1.4m sanitary towels are flushed down the toilet every day in the UK.\n\nDaish is neither the first nor the only woman taking a stand against this. But, finally, there are signs that the government and the retail industry are taking the problem seriously. Last month, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first company to stop producing plastic applicators for its own-brand tampons, removing 2.7 tonnes of plastic annually. \u201cThis move shows that people power has a huge impact. It speaks volumes,\u201d says Daish, who is putting pressure on other big names, including Procter & Gamble and Boots. \u201cPlastic tampon applicators are used for seconds, yet take centuries to break down, and they have avoidable impacts on the environment.\u201d\n\nThe Scottish government has also taken a stand, with a \u00a3175,200 campaign in partnership with Zero Waste Scotland to encourage women to try free samples of period pants, menstrual cups and reusable sanitary pads. In Wales, Caerphilly council has taken the decision to devote all of its period poverty funding to eco-friendly products \u2013 a UK first.\n\nQuick guide What is the Upside? Show Hide Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.

Another option is the silicone menstrual cup that is inserted into the vagina to collect blood flow. Menstrual cups can be used for 10 years and cost about \u00a320 \u2013 that equates to 16p for each menstrual cycle.\n\nBut there is still a lack of information comparing sanitary products. \u201cDespite the fact that 1.9 billion women globally are of menstruating age, spending on average 65 days a year dealing with menstrual blood flow, few good-quality studies exist that compare sanitary products,\u201d says Prof Penelope Phillips-Howard from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and the lead author of research on the subject, published in the Lancet Public Health.\n\nOver 10 years, a menstrual cup is estimated to create 0.4% of the plastic waste generated by single-use pads and 6% of that produced by using tampons. \u201cMenstrual cups will contribute to decreasing pollution of plastic waste from monthly use of disposable sanitary products,\u201d adds Phillips-Howard who found that awareness about cups was extremely low, even though 199 brands are available in 99 countries.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Environment Network (WEN), which coined the term \u201cenvironmenstrual\u201d in 2004, is noticing real momentum for change in the UK.\n\n\u201cAfter Blue Planet II, people realised the sheer scale of plastic pollution in our seas, our soil and our own bodies. Women seem happier to talk about periods \u2026 they had previously been seen as taboo,\u201d says Kate Metcalf, WEN\u2019s co-director. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got a long way to go, but it\u2019s becoming more mainstream and the Women\u2019s Institute just joined our coalition, so our reach is spreading.\u201d\n\nAccording to Metcalf, period education is \u201cpatchy and outdated\u201d. WEN is collaborating with the UK-based nonprofit group City to Sea, which campaigns to prevent plastic pollution at source, to create a schools programme called Rethink Periods. It is training 600 teachers across England to get the message across to adolescents. Crucially, says the campaign\u2019s national coordinator Clare Marshall, lessons are accompanied by a free box of period pants, menstrual cups, organic cotton disposables and reusable pads, so that pupils can see and feel the products. \u201cGirls and boys are often shocked to find out that certain products contain plastic,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cThey are keen to find out what they can do, so we highlight how Ella Daish is successfully taking on the big guns; hopefully teenagers will listen up.\u201d\n\nAlec Mills, the co-founder of Dame, a company that produces the world\u2019s first reusable tampon applicator, says the onus is on government to provide sustainable menstrual products in schools. \u201cThere\u2019s a perfect storm of cultural change \u2013 people are more prepared to talk about their periods, plus there\u2019s this enormous plastic-free environmental drive,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, women are questioning the products they are using \u2013 now is the time to create positive changes and let the concrete set on a young generation making new habits.\u201d\n\nBut there is concern about the Westminster government\u2019s new Period Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Procter & Gamble which already supplies free Always pads and Tampax tampons to school pupils.\n\n\u201cOur calculations show that it would be cheaper in the long term for government to promote reusables and plastic-free alternatives,\u201d says Ruby Raut, the founder of Wuka period pants, which can be worn for up to eight hours and then washed. \u201cThis is simply not in line with the government\u2019s call for all schools to become plastic-free by 2022.\u201d\n\nRaut, Mills and Daish joined others to sign an open letter demanding that the Department for Education offers free sustainable alternatives to girls in English secondary education. The winner of the tender to provide free sanitary products in schools is due to be announced imminently, and campaigners want to see a substantial commitment to plastic-free products.\n\nThe concept of plastic-free periods is nothing new. Susie Hewson founded Natracare in 1989, producing plastic-free, organic cotton tampons and pads that are home-compostable. \u201cWe won\u2019t compromise on the materials we use or how they are sourced, but for big brands developing new markets, in India, for example, plastic is cheap to produce and light to distribute,\u201d she says.\n\nHewson adds: \u201cThe damage from our throwaway culture and unfettered growth is accumulating somewhere \u2013 there are consequences for everything we do.\u201d She is calling for full disclosure of ingredients on product packaging to be a legal requirement. \u201cLegislation is the biggest innovator \u2013 there\u2019s a pressing need to reduce how much plastic we stick down the toilet.\u201d Daish agrees: \u201cWe should know exactly what is in the products we put in and around such an intimate area of our bodies for extended periods of time; I wouldn\u2019t put a plastic bag down there, I\u2019m sure a lot of people wouldn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d Her goal is for all period products to become plastic-free: \u201cWe can all make a difference and change our habits \u2013 I just want to keep pushing for change.\u201d\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
