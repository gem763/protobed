Only two states will have a single insurer in 2020, compared to five states that had only one insurer in 2019.\n\nTwo years ago, there were dozens of counties at risk of not having any ObamaCare plans, although some insurers eventually stepped in to sell coverage.\n\nBut in 2019 there was an increase in the numbers of insurers and that number will continue to rise in 2020.\n\nOut of the 38 states that use the federal healthcare.gov website, 15 states have more insurers participating in 2020 than 2019, and 28 states have counties with more insurers in 2020 than 2019 due to new insurers entering, and existing issuers expanding service areas, the administration said.\n\nThe health law\u2019s seventh open enrollment season begins Nov. 1, and while Trump administration officials openly decry the law, they also said they are focused on making it work.\n\n\u201cThe ACA simply doesn\u2019t work and it is still unaffordable for far too many. But until Congress gets around to replacing it, President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he doesn't want NYT in the White House Veterans group backs lawsuits to halt Trump's use of military funding for border wall Schiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails MORE will do what he can to fix the problems created by this system for millions of Americans,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters.\n\nAzar said the reduced premiums and increased plan options are evidence that the administration\u2019s policies\u2014 like cutting the open enrollment period, expanding short-term plans and promoting the elimination of the law\u2019s individual mandate\u2014 have helped, not \u201cundermined\u201d the law as critics say.\n\nBut experts argue this year\u2019s numbers are more of a market correction than anything else. In 2017, insurance companies implemented massive double-digit premium hikes, citing concerns about the elimination of the individual mandate, short-term plans, and cuts to ObamaCare\u2019s outreach and advertising budget.\n\nNow though, the market has stabilized and is profitable. Insurers already priced for the changes, and premiums are coming down.\n\n\u201cInsurers feel they\u2019ve weathered the worst of the storm,\u201d said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University\u2019s Health Policy Institute.\n\nThis year though, insurers could be grappling with the fallout of the Texas ObamaCare lawsuit, if a federal appeals court rules the law is unconstitutional. Azar dismissed that as a concern.\n\nIf the law is struck down, Azar said there will likely be an appeal to the Supreme Court, and the ruling would likely to stayed, meaning the law would remain in place.\n\n\u201cThere would be no disruption for the enrollment period,\u201d Azar said. \u201cWe will run the program the day after such a ruling the way we ran it the day before.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration is touting its success running a\u00a0program it has actively tried to end, as a number of ObamaCare plans will be cheaper in the\u00a0upcoming open enrollment period.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/obamacareenrollment_110117getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
