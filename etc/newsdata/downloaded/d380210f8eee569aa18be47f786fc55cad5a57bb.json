They declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly.\n\nMost shops at the attack site were shuttered Saturday as people have resisted opening them to protest against India\u2019s move in August to scrap the special status the Jammu and Kashmir state had under the Indian constitution.\n\nThere is anger and discontent among many in Kashmir over that decision. At the time, India blocked phone and internet across the region and sent in thousands of additional troops, imposing curfew-like restrictions to dampen discontent.\n\nIndia has said its move was essential to integrate Kashmir fully into India and spur development in the Muslim-majority region, which is also claimed by India\u2019s arch rival Pakistan.\n\nBut critics have said India\u2019s move could push more Kashmiris towards militancy.\n\nA grenade attack in southern Kashmir\u2019s Anantnag city a week ago injured 10 people, police said.\n\nMany in Srinagar have staged protests against the government move, despite the curbs.\n\nCommunication and travel restrictions have gradually been eased and India said by Monday it would partially restore mobile phone lines, although the internet still remains largely blocked.", "description": "At least five people were injured in a grenade attack in India-controlled Kashmir's main city of Srinagar on Saturday, police said, the second such attack since India stripped the Himalayan region of its special status.", "authors": ["Fayaz Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
