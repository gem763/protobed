South Australia and Tasmania: Four-and-a-half on January 1 Victoria and ACT: Four turning five by April 30 Western Australia and Northern Territory: Four turning five by June 30 New South Wales and Queensland: Four turning five by July 31\n\nRebecca said little Darcy struggles with communication so she feels he needs more time to develop.\n\n'He just needs that extra time to be a little boy instead of being in that classroom environment of \"you have to sit down, you have to do this, you have to do that\",' she said.\n\n'He's going to be one step behind his peers at every stage.'\n\nThe parents said they have approached multiple local schools to ask whether they could hold their son back for a year and start pre-primary in 2021 instead - but their request was declined.\n\n'Just give us a little bit of flexibility, that's all we're asking. It's a week. A week here or there is not going to do the child harm and in the case of our son, it'll do him the world of good,' father Shane said.\n\nThe couple have also considered moving interstate just so they could delay their son's schooling for 12 months.\n\nTaking to social media, many parents around the country revealed why they delayed their kids from entering the classroom.\n\nQueensland mother Mirandah said her son was due to start school next year but she decided to hold him back in childcare because he was not ready.\n\n'We are struggling with toilet training, social skills and fine motor skills. I don't blame these parents for pushing for him to be held back,' Mirandah said.\n\n'I'd fight for the same thing if I had to - why let the boy struggle through school? Keep him back and it will give him a chance to flourish.'\n\nThe state has the youngest compulsory school starting age in the country, while New South Wales parents can decide when they want to send their kids to school - but all children must be enrolled by their sixth birthday (stock image)\n\nQueensland mother Holly said keeping her son in kindergarten for a second year was the 'best decision for him'.\n\n'My son was in the same boat. He is now flourishing at school. Every child is unique however I am so relieved the decision was ours to make,' she said.\n\nNSW school counsellor and psychologist Rebecca said forcing children to learn at a young age was doing more harm than good.\n\n'Expecting children aged between four to six years to sit at desks, learn from textbooks, and think in a rational cognitive way is ludicrous because their brain is literally not even wired to do that yet,' she said on Facebook.\n\n'Forcing it to is just creating generations of kids who have a negative self attitude to learning and underdeveloped social-emotional skills because that part of their brain development is being denied in all of Australia's current school systems, public and private.'\n\nNSW retired teacher Gaye said she's 'dumbfounded' by the strict schooling age.\n\n'The older the child begins school, the better,' she said.\n\n'Secondary school is where the difference of that one year becomes even more obvious. I could point out every child in my classes who started school too young. Their struggle was real academically and socially.'", "description": "Australian parents are fighting to delay their children from starting school by a year because they feel their youngsters are not ready for the classroom.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/03/20016824-0-image-a-9_1571713134579.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
