Haven\u2019t seen that since Pimlico School (sob).\n\nDLR Lexicon, Dublin, Ireland (2014)\n\n\u2018A brave juggernaut like structure\u2019: noledgeishienouf\n\nCarr Cotter & Naessens\u2019 library in Dublin trumps the Peckham library by Alsop by a distance. Though stigmatised initially, it has become a real nexus of learning, and it is a brave juggernaut-like structure, with all its reading rooms projecting into the harbour.\n\nThe Shard, London, UK (2013)\n\n\u2018Post apocalyptic\u2019: FarmyardManure\n\nThe Shard \u2013 it looks post apocalyptic and I always expect to see a huge Chris Foss-style spaceship looming over it whenever I see it.\n\nNeues Museum, Berlin, Germany (2009)\n\n\u2018It reminds us how thin the veneer of culture is\u2019: nilpferd\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Neues Museum main staircase hall, by David Chipperfield Architects in collaboration with Julian Harrap. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo\n\nThe Neues Museum is indeed a masterpiece and an object lesson in how to deal with existing spaces. Practically every single exhibition space involves a blend of historical and new surfaces. The use of innovative new volumetric forms \u2013 a brick dome in one corner to replace a damaged roof, a series of tent-like overhead swoops in another \u2013 as well as the fantastically subtle introduction of new mosaic flooring or wall frieze patterns, maintains a clear distinction between new and old, yet creates a coherent whole greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nLong after the \u201cnew\u201d additions have become part of the furniture of the Museumsinsel, these subtle interactions will continue to shine. Just as the Neues Museum\u2019s exhibits speak of humankind\u2019s endless potential for war and conquest, so does the building remind us how thin the veneer of culture is, yet how resilient it can still be.\n\nThe best architecture of the 21st century Read more\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, London, UK (2019)\n\n\u2018Takes the enjoyment of spectacle to new heights\u2019: Kimmie4553\n\nThe new Tottenham stadium should be included here. Sport/entertainment is a central part of modern lives and this building takes the enjoyment of spectacle to new heights. It has reimagined what the world\u2019s premier sport can be and how it can be viewed. The Bird\u2019s Nest is not really a building used on a specific, regular basis. It might look pretty, but the Spurs stadium is all about how it feels and the user experience.\n\nTate Modern, London, UK (2000)\n\n\u2018A great building\u2019: michaelsherif\n\nTate \u2013 yes!
