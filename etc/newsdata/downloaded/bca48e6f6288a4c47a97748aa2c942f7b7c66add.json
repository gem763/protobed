(Image: ABC,Image: ABC,Image: Warner Bros.,Image: Anna Biller Productions,Image: Netflix)\n\nThere\u2019s something I need to tell you all: I have magic. It\u2019s true! Even I was surprised. Now, I can\u2019t conjure flames or raise people from the dead \u2014 as much fun as it would be to reanimate Benedict Arnold and, I don\u2019t know, light him on fire or something. What I do have is an otherworldly knowledge... of style.\n\nGaze into my Swarovski crystal ball and let me take you on a journey of flowing chiffon, oversized hats, onyx necklaces and platform boots with maybe, just maybe, one too many buckles or zippers. We\u2019re ranking the Top 20 Witchy Fashions from movies and TV from the past... oh, as far back as my abilities take me. My powers are strange and unpredictable. Who knows where they\u2019ll lead.\n\nWorst witches get the worst hats. (Image: Netflix)\n\n20. The Worst Witch\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Worst Witch we\u2019re dealing with here, it\u2019s the worst hats. Whatever sorceress decided these girls should don misshapen traffic cones on their heads should have their spellbooks revoked. I do want to give props for those cloaks, though. They may be gaudy, but they look cosy as hell.\n\nHoly crap, is that James Holden? (Image: Screen Gems)\n\n19. The Covenant\n\nLet\u2019s hear it for the boys, as we need to get some warlocks on this list. Sadly, we don\u2019t have much in the way of men\u2019s magick makers except for The Covenant, i.e. that 2006 movie you never would have remembered had I not just pointed it out. I told you: I have magic powers.\n\nMuch like The Vampire Diaries, Supernatural, or The Secret Circle, The Covenant thought our bewitching lads should dress real... by which I mean really boring. Come on, you had Interview with the Vampire in the palm of your hand as inspiration for men\u2019s otherworldly couture, and you went with Backstreet Boys circa the Black and Blue tour. Even Twilight did this better.\n\nThe only saving grace from this one is that it stars Sebastian Stan, aka the Winter Soldier, and Steven Strait, one of the stars of The Expanse. Also that locker room scene. You know the one.\n\nThe Charmed Ones sure loved making fashion \u201cchoices.\u201d (Image: WB)\n\n18. The Charmed Ones (Charmed)\n\nThe first couple seasons of Charmed were pretty harmless and fun went it came to style, but halfway through the series someone decided the Halliwells needed to be like those girls from Sex and the City... only witches.\n\nThis meant having the sisters make some bizarre fashion faux pas (let\u2019s not forget that one time they were superheroes). The show now serves as a time capsule of terrible \u201890s and early 2000s fashion. Will the new Charmed follow suit? The vision is still a bit blurry. But yes, definitely yes.\n\nLife is a party when you have powers and Jack Nicholson tricks you into a polyamorous relationship. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\n17. The Witches of Eastwick\n\nA trio of fashionable friends who, unaware that they\u2019re witches, accidentally form a coven before being drawn into a polyamorous relationship with Jack Nicholson. It\u2019s definitely got that \u201880s glam, and every character\u2019s hair game is flawless (except for Jack Nicholson, who\u2019s sporting a weird half-bun thing). Still, nothing about it screams super witchy to me.\n\nKiki\u2019s got one outfit but makes it work. (Image: Studio Ghibli)\n\n16. Kiki (Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service)\n\nSure she only has one outfit and it\u2019s a glorified potato sack, but she\u2019s owning it.\n\nWe all dream we could layer this well. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\n15. Practical Magic\n\nIt\u2019s The Craft meets Hope Floats, a spellbinding combination for the Nora Roberts fans out there (guilty). Sandra Bullock\u2019s Sally Owens is pretty milquetoast with her young mum couture, while Nicole Kidman (as Gillian) manages to kick it up a notch with darker colours and sweeping fabrics. However, the VIPs of Practical Magic are the aunts, played by Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest. It\u2019s like they refuse to ever remove their clothing, instead piling on layer after layer until they\u2019re swaths of autumn-fuelled patterns and texture.\n\nThose eyebrows are to die for... (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\n14. The Grand High Witch (The Witches)\n\nShe may have revealed a horrible goo face, but before that? Flawless.\n\nIt was indeed her finest hour. (Image: Alana Productions)\n\n13. Teen Witch\n\nLouise was a teenage nerd who found out she had powers and like a genius used them to become the most popular (and stylish) girl in school. She had the coolest clothes, the bounciest hair, and the hottest boyfriend a softcore montage through an abandoned barn could afford. Also, it\u2019s a musical with the best-worst rap song in movie history \u2014 in case you needed another reason to finally see this movie, Kevin. Yes, I know you\u2019re thinking about it. Magic.\n\nNot everyone can pull off a purple and lime green pantsuit with turquoise eyeshadow, but by God she does it. (Image: ABC)\n\n12. Endora (Bewitched)\n\nBewitched\u2019s Samantha may have been the cool witch on the block, but her mother was the maven. She never approved of her daughter marrying a mortal, and liked to prank Samantha\u2019s husband Darrin as a way to punish him for it. But I think we were the ones actually being punished. We all had to watch from a distance as Endora graced the room every week in her signature get-up, curls, and perfected eyeshadow, never giving us the time of day.\n\nHermoine (Emma Watson) knows how to make an entrance. (Image: Warner Bros.)\n\n11. Hermione Granger (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)\n\nFor most of the Harry Potter series, Hermione\u2019s wardrobe consisted of oversized cloaks at school and zip-up hoodies on the weekends. But for the Yule Ball scene of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the smartest person at Hogwarts let her hair down, figuratively, in a show-stopping gown that made her the envy of everyone at the dance. [Editor\u2019s Note: It should have been blue. -Jill P.]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna burn that guy in a sec, but real quick how\u2019s my outfit?\u201d (Image: HBO)\n\n10. Melisandre (Game of Thrones)\n\nMelisandre wasn\u2019t the only style queen in Westeros, but she definitely ranked up there. Her signature colour was red and she knew how to sell it with every ensemble. Long sleeves, deep-cut necklines, and the necklace that held the secret to her eternal beauty. She also gets a bonus for never letting something as pesky as wintry weather get in the way of high fashion. Internal fire isn\u2019t just about keeping a connection with her god... it\u2019s a great way to keep showing off her threads.\n\nPilgrim collars are so in right now. (Image: Netflix)\n\n9. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\n\nI love Melissa Joan Hart as much as the next witch, but her Sabrina Spellman was basically a VSCO girl before those were a thing. In Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) and her Weird Sisters know how to combine sweet and dangerous into a witchy combo with their pseudo-puritanical school garb. They also get bonus points for their makeup, which always includes at least one perfected smoky eye and deep crimson lipstick.\n\n\u201cDid you just say... I can\u2019t rock a feather neckline?!\u201d (Image: ABC)\n\n8. Evil Queen Regina (Once Upon a Time)\n\nThe shoulder pads. The sleeves. The giant ponytail that rivals Ariana Grande. Zelena may have been the Wicked Witch on Once Upon a Time, one who had her share of great outfits, but Queen Regina reigned supreme in terms of her royal style. She rarely made a fashion mistake, because nothing could look bad once she was wearing it. And if you dared question any of her ensemble choices \u2014 yes, even the ponytail \u2014 she\u2019d simply kill you where you stand.\n\nThey\u2019ll always rule the runway. (Image: Syfy)\n\n7. Eliot and Margo (The Magicians)\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re attending class, playing Welters, or ruling Fillory, Eliot and Margo always have the right look for the occasion. They will always be the king and queen of their domain, even in exile, because there\u2019s no one that looks better. Come on, how many other people can rock an eyepatch?\n\nElaine (Samantha Robinson) knows it\u2019s all about the hat. (Image: Anna Biller Productions)\n\n6. Elaine (The Love Witch)\n\nElaine (Samantha Robinson) is one of the newest witches on the list, but she\u2019s earned her place near the top. A perfect combination of vintage threads and modern chic, Elaine is a witch who stands out from the crowd of Hot Topic customers. It also feels fitting that she\u2019s donning blue eyeshadow with this ensemble, a possible nod to Endora\u2019s classic look from Bewitched.\n\nTwo of Scarlet Witch\u2019s many looks. (Image: Marvel,Image: Disney)\n\n5. The Scarlet Witch\n\nThis one is tough, because the Marvel Cinematic Universe outfit is, ummm, not the best. But I\u2019m keeping her up here because the iconic look is so iconic. Plus, I\u2019m holding out hope for the Disney+ series finally gives Elisabeth Olsen\u2019s Scarlet Witch the threads she so rightfully deserves. I mean, just look at that helmet, the billowing cloak. Imagine how many amazing spells she could do with that powerful \u201cvision.\u201d One can dream.\n\nCome little children, I\u2019ll take thee away. (Image: Disney)\n\n4. The Sanderson Sisters (Hocus Pocus)\n\nThey put a spell on us, indeed.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s too warm to wear a cossack in New Orleans, but maaaaaaybe? (Image: AMC)\n\n3. American Horror Story: Coven\n\nIf you want to see perfect witch couture, look no further than the entire cast of American Horror Story: Coven. The ladies of Miss Robichaux\u2019s Academy for Exceptional Young Ladies are decked head to toe in black lace, silky layers, and rich lustrous fabrics. And don\u2019t forget the hats! A good witch doesn\u2019t go anywhere without her awesome hat. Unless you\u2019re the worst witch. Those poor witches get traffic cones.\n\nShe\u2019s under her spell, as are we. (Image: WB)\n\n2. Willow and Tara (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)\n\nOur favourite witchy couple certainly knew how to dress the part. For example, in \u201cOnce More With Feeling,\u201d the pair donned these fantastic outfits that made them look like two of the cutest (and sexiest) magic-users on the planet. Of course, it was saddened by the fact that, at the time, Willow had put a spell on Tara to make them forget their recent fight. Then, Tara was later killed, leading Willow to embrace her dark side. It was one of the darkest moments of the series, but at least Dark Willow had a keen fashion sense too.\n\nYou knew this is where it would end. (Image: Columbia Pictures)\n\n1. The Craft\n\nSeriously, was the top pick going to be anything else? The answer is no, no it was not. Because I have magic powers, and they all say Fairuza Balk kicks arse. These four witches defined a generation of girls experimenting with Hot Topic, ouiji boards, and sacred circles that they tried to cast in 20 minutes or less... ears straining to the door to make sure their mums weren\u2019t coming to check up on them. Oh come on, it wasn\u2019t just me, right?", "description": "There\u2019s something I need to tell you all: I have magic. It\u2019s true! Even I was surprised.
