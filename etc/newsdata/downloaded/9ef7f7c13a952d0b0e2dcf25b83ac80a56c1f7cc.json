My own collection includes volumes by A.W. Thayer and Maynard Solomon, Harold C. Schonberg\u2019s analysis in \u201cThe Lives of the Great Composers,\u201d and Russell Martin\u2019s quirky but entertaining \u201cBeethoven\u2019s Hair.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to non-musical topics such as Beethoven\u2019s political ideals, the treasure chest is surprisingly bare. A tiny handful of academic studies exist, Solomon lightly tackled it, and authors like Schonberg have made fleeting references. But it appears that scholars prefer to let Beethoven\u2019s music be his only muse.\n\nJohn Clubbe\u2019s \u201cBeethoven: The Relentless Revolutionary\u201d is the first attempt to shift mild curiosity surrounding the composer\u2019s politics into a crescendo of intellectual study. An author who taught English at Duke University and the University of Kentucky, he regards himself as a cultural historian rather than musicologist.\n\nHis book therefore places Beethoven \u201cwithin the context of the political events and human energy swirling around him during the decades of his maturity.\u201d In doing so, he discovers the composer was a \u201crevolutionary not only in his music but also, and not least, in his social and political thinking.\u201d\n\nBeethoven lived through the Age of Enlightenment, and was influenced by different thinkers of a revolutionary spirit. Mr. Clubbe believes he \u201cfelt the revolutionary impact\u201d of France\u2019s Jean-Jacques Rousseau, including the \u201cpotentiality of Man \u2014 especially of Man in society.\u201d Friedrich Schiller, who became \u201cthe representative figure of German Enlightenment thinking,\u201d had a greater impact on him than either Immanuel Kant or Johann Gottfried Herder due to his \u201ccourage and independent stance.\u201d\n\nWith respect to the French Revolution, Beethoven\u2019s goal, which was \u201cinspired in part by Schiller\u2019s poems and plays, was to achieve both freedom and joy.\u201d He was both an idealist and cautious by nature, although his outlook on life was relatively positive. In fact, \u201cevery energetic impulse he had either found expression in some dimension of his creativity or, if necessary, turned inward until the day arrived when it could find expression.\u201d\n\nThe book takes some interesting twists on the musical road to revolutionary thought.\n\nOne of the more unusual inclusions was the Greek philosopher Plutarch \u2014 who, according to an 1801 letter Beethoven wrote to his childhood friend Franz Wegeler, \u201chas shown me the path of resignation.\u201d The composer would also learn of the \u201chistory, political institutions, and great men of Greece and Rome.\u201d So much so, that Mr. Clubbe suggests \u201cone reason for this admiration is that Beethoven thought of himself among the Plutarchian great.\u201d\n\nVienna\u2019s love affair with music and culture inspired Beethoven, too. He wanted to be the \u201cheir\u201d to brilliant Austrian composers like Franz Joseph Haydn (who praised him when he was young) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (who may or may not have met him, depending on which story you believe), and worked hard to achieve this goal. Alas, it didn\u2019t have the intellectual impact he had hoped for.\n\n\u201cVienna\u2019s political stagnation and repression\u201d didn\u2019t mesh with his Enlightenment ideals, Mr. Clubbe notes, and he remained an outsider who was \u201cproud of being a Rhinelander and unwilling or unable to learn the local Viennese dialect.\u201d\n\nOne of the most important historical figures to Beethoven was Napoleon Bonaparte. He regarded the French military leader and emperor \u201cnot in reverent adulation, but level-eyed, as an equal.\u201d They were both seen as outsiders and \u201clooked upon the society in which he lived from without as much as from within.\u201d\n\nWhile the author points out a significant difference between the two \u2014 Beethoven was \u201cboth a genius and a moral man\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s no question that \u201cNapoleon yet loomed large before him as a man of almost mythic achievement.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Beethoven originally dedicated his famous Symphony No. 3, or Eroica, to Intitolata Bonaparte (\u201cTitled Bonaparte\u201d). It was later scratched out and rededicated to his wealthy patron, Prince Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz \u2014 a much safer pseudo-inspiration than the controversial French revolutionary.\n\nMr. Clubbe\u2019s assessment is that while Beethoven \u201cdid not express the slightest interest in political theory, he followed the public life of the times closely.\u201d Indeed, he would never have been described as a \u201cdoctrinaire revolutionary,\u201d but could have been depicted as something more of an \u201cidealistic rebel, or rather, often a rebel, sometimes a revolutionary, more usually somewhere in between.\u201d\n\nDid politics play a role in Beethoven\u2019s musical odyssey? The jury is still out. Musicologists will probably dismiss Mr. Clubbe\u2019s analysis, but historians now have more than mere musical notes to chew on.\n\n\u2022 Michael Taube is a contributor to The Washington Times.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBEETHOVEN: THE RELENTLESS REVOLUTIONARY\n\nBy John Clubbe\n\nW.W.
