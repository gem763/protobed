Wine from France, Spain and Germany will now face 25 percent tariffs.\n\nFrench wine and Scottish whiskies are among the high-profile targets\n\nSpeaking in Washington hours before the tariffs were due to come into effect, France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire warned the move would have serious repercussions.\n\n\"Europe is ready to retaliate, in the framework of course of the WTO,\" he told reporters shortly after meeting with US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund annual meetings.\n\n\"These decisions would have very negative consequences both from an economic and a political point of view.\"\n\nLe Maire was due to meet US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer later on Friday.\n\nHe also warned the US against starting another front in its trade conflicts and again called for a negotiated solution.\n\nUS tariffs on European goods\n\nAt a time when the global economy is slowing, \"I think that our responsibility is to do our best to avoid that kind of conflict,\" Le Maire said.\n\nThe Europeans have long advocated negotiation over conflict and they themselves will be able to impose tariffs next year to punish the United States for subsidising Boeing.\n\nBut EU officials had already offered in July to call a truce on subsidies for planemakers, in which both sides would admit fault and agree to curtail state aid -- to no avail. The two sides have been involved in a row over the subsidies for 15 years.\n\nThe tariffs kick in just days after the United States was given the formal go-ahead by the World Trade Organization.\n\nAs recently as Wednesday, Trump singled out the Europeans for being unfair with the US on trade, but said his door was open to negotiate a settlement.\n\n- 'Very hard' -\n\nThe Europeans fear above all that Trump will impose heavy duties on imports of European cars around mid-November.\n\nThis would be a serious blow for the German automotive sector in particular, even if giants such as Volkswagen or BMW also manufacture in the United States.\n\nWhisky producers in Scotland have kept a clamour of protest\n\n\"Our products are very hard to bring in (to Europe)\" when Europeans easily import their cars into the United States, Trump said.\n\nThe Airbus-Boeing row is just one of several issues stoking transatlantic tensions that quickly descended into acrimony when Trump took office in 2017.\n\nTrump embraced a protectionist agenda, slapping import duties on steel and aluminium from the EU and other allies, while also threatening tariffs on cars.\n\nTrade groups in Europe such as winemakers, German tool manufacturers and whisky producers in Scotland have kept a clamour of protest, demanding Washington reverse tack.\n\nFrench Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said that Europe is ready to retaliate\n\nThe US leader and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker agreed in July 2018 to a ceasefire in the conflict to hold trade talks that have so far led nowhere.\n\nThe epic legal battle between Airbus and Boeing at the World Trade Organization began in 2004 when Washington accused Britain, France, Germany and Spain of providing illegal subsidies and grants to support the production of a range of Airbus products.\n\nA year later, the EU alleged that Boeing had received $19.1 billion worth of prohibited subsidies from 1989 to 2006 from various branches of the US government.\n\nThe two cases were then tangled up in a legal quagmire, with each side being given partial vindication after a long series of appeals and counter appeals.", "description": "The United States imposed tariffs on a record $7.5-billion worth of European Union goods on Friday, despite threats of retaliation, with Airbus, French wine...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/05/wire-19870060-1571373474-445_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
