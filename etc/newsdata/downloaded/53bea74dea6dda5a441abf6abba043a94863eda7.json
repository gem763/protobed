She is expected to waive her preliminary hearing during her bond hearing on Thursday afternoon and plead guilty to the charges next week, Nerheim said.\n\nA public defender for Davis declined to provide a comment to ABC News on the case.\n\nLake County Sheriffs Office\n\nThe four other offenders, who are all 16 and 17 years old, will be tried in juvenile court, but Nerheim could not provide the details of their charges \"due to strict laws governing juvenile courtroom proceedings.\"\n\nThe homeowner was in bed around 1:15 a.m. when he saw headlights moving up his \"exceptionally long driveway,\" which sits on a remote property, Nerheim said. He told authorities that as he was getting ready to go outside, he noticed the SUV turn around to face the the street before several people inside got out and approached his home.\n\nThe man then armed himself with his gun, which he owned legally, and fired it out of fear for his and his wife's safety, striking the 14-year-old. Nerheim said.\n\nAfter the teens fled the scene, they led authorities on a high-speed chase back to Chicago and only stopped the car once they ran out of gas, Nerheim said.\n\nThey then fled on foot but were later caught, telling detectives that they didn't stop the vehicle because \"they didn't want to go back to jail,\" Nerheim said.\n\nA 10-inch long hunting knife and a cell phone with pinned GPS coordinates of other homes near Old Mill Creek were later found on the homeowner's driveway, Nerheim said.\n\nThe \"sole purpose\" of the teens' trip from Chicago to Old Mill Creek \"was to commit several vehicle burglaries,\" Nerheim said.\n\n\"The dilemma I have faced for the last five weeks surrounding the Old Mill Creek case has been balancing justice, the safety of our community, and recognizing the ages of the offenders involved,\" Nerheim said.\n\nAlthough Nerheim initially charged the teens with felony murder, which \"does fit the crime committed,\" he decided to exercise \"discretion in this situation,\" as he hopes the teens \"will learn from this tragedy,\" and \"take this opportunity to be rehabilitated,\" due to their young ages, he said.\n\n\"It is time for these offenders to understand the seriousness of their actions and face the consequences,\" Nerheim said in the statement. \"If they choose to continue to follow the troubled path they are currently on, it will end in only one of two ways \u2013 either with another tragic funeral or with more involvement with the criminal justice system.\"", "description": "Felony murder charges have been dropped against five Chicago teenagers after a 14-year-old who was with them during a burglary attempt was shot and killed by a homeowner.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/shooting-ht-as-190816_hpMain_2_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
