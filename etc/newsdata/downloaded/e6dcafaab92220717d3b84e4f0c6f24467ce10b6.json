It was collected in samples of soil and leaf litter by Dr. William C. Block in the 1960s. Dr. Block\u2019s collection was later donated to the Museum in 1978.\n\nAs of Friday, the official Latin name for the beetle, which belongs to the Ptiliidae family of insects, is Nelloptodes gretae, a rough translation of Greta\u2019s name.\n\nThe young climate activist rocketed to fame as a result of her protests outside the Swedish parliament, which in August 2018 when Greta was 15. Soon after she began \u201cstriking\u201d from school on Fridays, calling on government to take stronger action against global warming.\n\nMuseum officials suggest that the new Greta beetle is just one of many new species yet to be discovered.\n\n\u201cThere are likely hundreds of exciting new species still to be discovered around the world as well as in the vast collections of the Natural History Museum,\u201d said Dr. Max Barclay, the Museum\u2019s Senior Curator in Charge of Coleoptera \u2014 or beetles.\n\n\u201cThe name of this beetle is particularly poignant since it is likely that undiscovered species are being lost all the time, before scientists have even named them, because of biodiversity loss \u2014 so it is appropriate to name one of the newest discoveries after someone who has worked so hard to champion the natural world and protect vulnerable species,\u201d Barclay said.\n\nThe scientific description of the beetle has been published Friday in The Entomologist\u2019s Monthly Magazine.\n\n\u201cI am delighted that we have published a species name that acknowledges all that Greta and her supporters have done,\u201d said Andrew Wakeham-Dawson, editor of the magazine.\n\nAccording to its website, the Natural History Museum receives some five million visitors each year.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "description": "The UK\u2019s Natural History Museum has named a newly discovered species of beetle after Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg.", "authors": ["Thomas D.
