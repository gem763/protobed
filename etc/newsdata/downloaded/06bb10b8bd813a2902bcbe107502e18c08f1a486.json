So this is a very big thing. It has the possibility of casting a very long shadow over not only the next few months, but also the possibility of a second term.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats and Republicans both claim to revere the principle of states\u2019 rights, each side, while occupying the White House, has at times leveraged federal authority to override state decisions. The general trajectory over the past quarter century has been toward steadily rising conflict between presidents of one party and states controlled by the opposing party.\n\nRead: Federalism is dead, long live federalism\n\nDuring the relatively less polarized 1990s, former President Bill Clinton managed to build alliances with Republican governors, such as John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, on issues such as welfare reform. But by the time Obama took office in 2009, coalitions of attorneys general from Republican states were routinely filing federal lawsuits challenging his policies. Those Republican lawsuits blocked several Obama initiatives, including his efforts to limit carbon emissions from electricity generation and to provide legal status to about 4 million undocumented immigrants. The Obama administration, in turn, launched lawsuits against some Republican states seeking to limit access to voting; Obama\u2019s Justice Department also sued to block Arizona\u2019s \u201cShow your papers\u201d law targeting undocumented immigrants.\n\nStill, Trump and Republicans in Congress have escalated these skirmishes to a new level. \u201cI can\u2019t really recall a federal administration that has so aggressively and on so many fronts claimed federal powers to supersede state authority,\u201d says Richard Frank, who studies environmental law at the University of California at Davis.\n\nThrough both legislation and executive action, Trump and congressional Republicans have pushed a series of policies that target blue states, starting with the tax bill passed in late 2017. That law sought to pressure blue states to cut their own taxes by capping what taxpayers could deduct in state and local taxes from their federal tax returns. (Almost all of the states in which the largest share of taxpayers claimed these deductions in 2016 voted for Hillary Clinton that year.)\n\nTrump has also tried to pressure so-called sanctuary cities that don\u2019t fully cooperate with federal immigration enforcement by withholding law-enforcement funds from them. And his Justice Department has sued California over its \u201csanctuary state\u201d law.", "description": "The president\u2019s move to revoke California\u2019s authority to set car-emission standards is part of a broader push to stymie the states that voted against him.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2E0ZD/facebook.jpg?1568903038", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
