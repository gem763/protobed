The round, led by MassMutual Ventures Southeast Asia, will be used on product development and to launch in four new Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The startup\u2019s platform, called Milieu Surveys, is already available in Singapore and Thailand and has signed more than 45 clients.\n\nThis brings Milieu Insight\u2019s total funding so far to $3.15 million, including a seed round announced in November 2018. Founded in December 2016 by CEO Gerald Ang, who previously worked at global research firms including GfK and YouGov, Milieu Insight seeks to make market research and data analysis accessible to smaller businesses and organizations. Milieu Portraits, its consumer segmentation tool, returns insights about specific demographics, including what products, media and brands they prefer, while Milieu Studies allows companies to create their own studies.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1904986,1904985,1904984\"]\n\nCOO Stephen Tracy told TechCrunch in an email that the startups\u2019 four new markets were picked because \u201cthey are in high demand among existing research buyers who want to study consumer trends, particularly because the market dynamics in these countries are evolving fast.\u201d Milieu focuses exclusively on mobile data since smartphone penetration is still growing quickly in many Southeast Asian markets.\n\nHe added \u201cone other dynamic that makes us particularly excited about expanding across Southeast Asia is that, through our investment in tech and automation, we\u2019re able to sell market research solutions at considerably more affordable price points (i.e. research studies as low as US$350). Meaning our platform can also activate new spending among businesses/organizations who couldn\u2019t previously afford it, such as charities/non-profits, academic institutions and startups.\u201d\n\nMilieu Insight\u2019s competitors include traditional research firms like Kantar and YouGov for Milieu Studies and Global Web Index for Milieu Portraits. Tracy says the startup\u2019s competitive edge is its end-to-end solution. \u201cThat is, there\u2019s no other company that offers a single platform that connects an audience (i.e. our managed consumer panel) with a SaaS service that allows you to access consumer profiling data on-demand as well as launch bespoke consumer studies and get results in just a few hours, all within a self-serve environment.\u201d\n\nIn a press statement, MassMutual Ventures managing director Anvesh Ramineni said \u201cMilieu\u2019s impressive team has built a world-class product, making market research services affordable, accessible and more relevant in today\u2019s mobile first landscape. We are pleased to lead Milieu\u2019s current round and look forward to supporting the company as it scales across the region.\u201d", "description": "Milieu Insight, a Singapore-based market research and data platform, announced today that it has raised $2.4 million in pre-A funding.
