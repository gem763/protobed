It's not our preferred outcome, we are working incredibly hard to get a deal by 31 October and I absolutely believe that can still happen.\n\n\"But, if we do not manage to do that, we do still need to leave the EU on that date \u2013 we cannot have any more dither and delay and we will leave if we have to without a deal on October 31.\u201d", "description": "The Chancellor says no-one \u201creally knows\u201d how much crashing out of the EU will cost the country \u2013 undermining repeated ministerial claims that the damage will be minimal and short-term.", "authors": ["Rob Merrick"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/29/19/sajid-javid.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
