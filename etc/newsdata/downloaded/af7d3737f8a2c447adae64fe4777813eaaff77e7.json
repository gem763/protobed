Today, Rockstar announced that its Wild West epic will be launching on PC on November 5th. As expected, the new platform will mean graphical and technical improvements, and Rockstar also says that there will be \u201cnew bounty hunting missions, gang hideouts, weapons, and more.\u201d The PC release will also include the multiplayer add-on Red Dead Online.\n\nActually purchasing a copy will be a little convoluted, however. Starting October 9th, the game will be available for preorder through the newly launched Rockstar Games Launcher, and those who preorder before October 22nd will receive some bonuses in the form of two free classic Rockstar games, including GTA III, Vice City, and Max Payne 3.\n\nAt launch, the game will also be available via the Epic Games Store, Greenman Gaming, the Humble Store, GameStop, and \u201cadditional digital retailers\u201d with preorders starting on October 23rd. Steam, meanwhile, will be coming on later: RDR2 will launch through Valve\u2019s store in December. The game will also be a launch title on the Google Stadia streaming platform in November.", "description": "Rockstar\u2019s Wild West action adventure game Red Dead Redemption 2 is finally coming to PC on November 5th, launching on platforms like the Rockstar Games Launcher and Epic Games Store.", "authors": ["Andrew Webster", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Atv0-0NLLAdPkyJSu6YITCAagKc=/0x75:3840x2085/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13122787/RDR2_Screenshot_080_copy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
