But the final sheet had been ripped out. That'd drive anyone spare.\n\nWith any crime story, we're eager to know the ending... but we don't want to know it in advance. Two tales of detection on the Beeb both fell foul of those basic rules.\n\nProfessor Sir Alec Jeffreys invented DNA fingerprinting, which revolutionised crimebusting\n\nCatching Britain's Killers: The Crimes That Changed Us (BBC2) was an account of the murder investigations that led to breakthroughs in DNA fingerprinting.\n\nThe crucial case was the hunt for the killer of two 15-year-old girls from villages near Leicester in the mid-Eighties.\n\nIt's a story that was told in dramatic depth four years ago, in the ITV true-crime thriller Code Of A Killer with David Threlfall as a dogged detective and John Simm as the brilliant scientist who identified the murderer using DNA evidence for the first time.\n\nCatching Britain's Killers needed to recount the essential facts, but it was a clunking mistake to spend the first 40 minutes going over such well-trodden ground. The recap was slow and unnecessarily detailed, when we all knew how the case ended.\n\nOther investigations, such as the genetic research that finally identified the remains of the murdered Tsar Nicholas II and his family, killed by Lenin's goon squad in 1918, were so rushed as to be incoherent.\n\nNothing was said, for instance, about the DNA match from a living relative that supplied the missing piece in the genetic puzzle in 1998: in fact, it came from Prince Philip, whose great-aunt was the Tsar's wife Alexandra.\n\nNo mention was made either of vital evidence that has been lost from the police archives over the years, in unsolved cases that might have been cracked if detectives had held on to blood samples or items of clothing.\n\nThe result was a trite and uncritical programme that told us nothing new and skimped on important background.\n\nBad taste of the night: Trying to create healthy ice lollies on The Apprentice (BBC1), the boys' team chose a splash of lavender flavouring. 'It tastes like me nan's wardrobe,' complained one customer. Well, who wants a frozen mothball on a stick?\n\nThere was nothing uncritical about art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon's view of notorious cheat Han van Meegeren, in The Forger Who Fooled The Nazis (BBC4). The wartime imposter, who passed off his own third-rate works as lost masterpieces by Vermeer, was a liar with no principles and scarcely more talent, the presenter fumed.\n\nHis fury kept this investigation bubbling, but at 90 minutes it was overlong. The chief characters were too sordid to hold our interest for more than an hour and we were kept waiting too long for the final chapter.\n\nAndrew's reaction when confronted with one of the fakes, in the vaults of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, was hilarious. He was aghast that anyone could have imagined for a moment that this crass, Disneyfied portrait of Christ could ever have been mistaken for the hand of the Renaissance master.\n\nI rather enjoyed the kitsch way Van Meegeren painted Bible characters with big, doll-like eyes. It's not hard to imagine his pictures, mass-produced in plastic frames on living room walls in the Sixties.\n\nAnd as for the mystery of Lady Don't Fall Backwards, Hancock tracked down the novelist, who admitted he couldn't find an ending for his book \u2014 so he ripped out the final page from every copy himself.\n\nNow that's an ingenious crime.", "description": "CHRISTOPHER STEVENS: Tony Hancock, in one of the most sublimely funny half- hours ever shown on television, once went frantic because the last page of his library book was missing.", "authors": ["Christopher Stevens For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/23/19515520-0-image-a-10_1570661513394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
