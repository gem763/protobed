In January the firm, founded by maverick Israeli entrepreneur Adam Neumann, was valued at $47bn by a SoftBank investment, but the rescue deal struck this week valued it at just $8bn.\n\nThat deal stands to give Mr Neumann a $1.7bn payout, a sum that has proved controversial among employees unhappy that the founder, who stepped down as chief executive last month, stands to gain considerable wealth despite the company\u2019s straitened circumstances.\n\nHis financial management of the firm was already a subject of controversy. Documents published in the run-up to WeWork\u2019s shelved flotation prompted concerns about its ownership structure and path to profitability.", "description": "WeWork is reportedly planning to lay off as many as 4,000 people as part of its recovery plans after a failed attempt to go public and a takeover by SoftBank this week.", "authors": ["Laurence Dodds", "Us Technology Reporter", "Harry De Quetteville"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/technology/2019/10/24/TELEMMGLPICT000212419254-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
