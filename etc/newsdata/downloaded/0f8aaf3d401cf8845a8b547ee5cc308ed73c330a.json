Cove / Splash News)\n\nShe posted the photo just as the story broke, then took to her Instagram story to post another photo of Junior on a train, drawing a love heart next to it.\n\nKatie's children are Harvey, 17, with Dwight Yorke, who is not involved in his life; Princess, 12, and Junior, 14, who she shares with ex husband Peter Andre.\n\nShe also shares Jett, six and Bunny, five, with ex Kieran Hayler.\n\nBuilder Charles, 22, has made some explosive statements about their brief fling.\n\nCharles claims that on the first night they met they binged on drugs and drink before sleeping together hours later.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nWhen he woke up the next morning she hadn't been to sleep and had trashed their hotel room, he said.\n\nHe rated her a 1/10 in bed, and said they would sleep in the annex of her mucky mansion because the main house is currently \"unlivable\".\n\nHe believes she cheated on him during their fling, but she would never admit to it.\n\nTheir relationship came to an end when Charles saw pictures of her leaving Kris Boyson's house.\n\n(Image: charlesdrury1/Instagram)\n\nKatie previously admitted to taking cocaine weekly for six months as she struggled to cope with her mum's terminal illness and ex husband Kieran's cheating.\n\nShe had checked into rehab and was treated for trauma and depression.\n\nA spokesperson for Katie Price said: \"There is no truth in the allegation that she is taking drugs every day and has made significant steps to being drug free - there have been lapses in the past but they are just that, not a regular event. Katie is still in recovery and making progress.\"", "description": "Katie has chosen not to address explosive claims made by her ex lover, and instead posted photos of her kids on Instagram", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Instagram", "Brett D.
