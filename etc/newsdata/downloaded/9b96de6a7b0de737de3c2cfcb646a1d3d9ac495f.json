Yang offered his remarks in response to CNN\u2019s opening question about impeachment during the 2020 Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday evening.\n\n\u201cI support impeachment, but we shouldn\u2019t have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful, or two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016,\u201d said Yang in response to CNN\u2019s opening question for Tuesday\u2019s Democratic debate in Westerville, Ohio:\n\nWe\u2019re standing in the great state of Ohio: the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state. Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns, and we\u2019re not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands. It\u2019s not just you, Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America\u2019s stores and malls, soaking up 20 billion dollars in business, while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected \u2014 the fourth industrial revolution \u2014 and that is going to accelerate and grow more serious, regardless of who is in The Oval Office.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, Donald Trump, when we\u2019re talking about him, we are losing,\u201d affirmed Yang. \u201cWe need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "White House hopeful Andrew Yang on Tuesday said Democrats \"shouldn't have any illusions\" with regards to impeaching President Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Andrew-Yang-Ohio-DemDebate-101519-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
