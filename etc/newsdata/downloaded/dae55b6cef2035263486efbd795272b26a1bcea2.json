Advocacy groups have filed appeals against various projects in the gentrifying neighborhood, and city officials changed a planning document in an attempt to reduce such challenges. (Justin T. Gellerson/For The Washington Post)\n\nThe D.C. Council voted Tuesday to approve a planning document that serves as a blueprint for a growing city, with new language that stresses the importance of affordable housing and shields development projects from litigation.\n\nLawmakers unanimously approved the framework for the city\u2019s comprehensive plan after nearly two years of wrestling among city officials, neighborhood groups, activists and developers over a vision for the future of the capital.\n\nThe stakes are high. As the District\u2019s population booms and young professionals pour into new luxury developments, low-income residents are being displaced at one of the highest rates in the country, according to one recent study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another step toward dealing with our housing crisis,\u201d said Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D). \u201cWe changed the framework to provide greater emphasis on the need for housing and affordable housing, as well as clarifying some ambiguities that have led to court cases.\u201d\n\nThe framework is just the first step, a collection of priorities and principles to guide development decisions.\n\n[Hundreds pack D.C. Council chambers for comprehensive plan debate]\n\nThe administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) says it will release next week the rest of the plan, which will detail policies related to transportation, environmental protection, green space and art. The plan, which is supposed to chart city growth over the next 20 years, must be approved by the council.\n\nAndrew Trueblood, the city\u2019s top planning official, said in a statement that the administration is \u201cworking closely with Council to ensure the language as passed supports the long-term vision and needs of DC residents.\u201d\n\nThe council last approved a comprehensive plan in 2006 and updated it in 2011.\n\nZoning decisions \u2014 including approval of large-scale projects and changes to community density \u2014 must conform to the comprehensive plan.\n\nAdvocacy groups and some neighbors have successfully challenged some projects in court, arguing that zoning approvals were inconsistent with the comprehensive plan.\n\nWhen the Bowser administration first proposed a new framework for the plan last year, administration officials sought to stop costly legal delays by reducing avenues for protests.\n\nCritics said her proposed changes made the rules surrounding development opaque and would make it harder to challenge projects that intensify gentrification.\n\nMendelson said the mayor\u2019s approach made the planning document too vague and general. He said his approach requires zoning commissioners to explain in their decisions how they balanced competing priorities laid out in the comprehensive plan.\n\nLawmakers also added language to prioritize affordable housing in land-use decisions and to consider racial equity.\n\nCouncil member Jack Evans (D-Ward 2), who has served on the council since 1991, said the plan is a reminder of how far the city has come from its financial crisis of the mid-1990s, when its bond rating was in the \u201cjunk\u201d category and Congress imposed a board to assume control of its finances.\n\n\u201cCertainly back in the early days the idea of a comprehensive plan was to stop the hemorrhaging of the city,\u201d said Evans, the council\u2019s longest-serving member. \u201cThe issues we face today aren\u2019t declining population and declining businesses, but rather the opposite.\u201d\n\nSome said the framework could have gone further to prevent unchecked development that has been forcing longtime residents out of the city.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned there\u2019s a rush to development without community input,\u201d said council member Trayon White Sr. (D), whose Ward 8 in Southeast is now feeling development pressures that have transformed many neighborhoods west of the Anacostia River.\n\n[Read the full bill]\n\nMendelson on Tuesday also announced new developments in the ethics investigation into Evans.\n\nHe tapped council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3) to chair an ad hoc committee to review the findings by a law firm that has been hired to determine whether Evans used his public office for personal gain. Evans, who has worked for several law firms and owned a private consulting business while serving on the council, is also the target of a federal grand jury investigation.\n\nIn a surprising move, Mendelson said every lawmaker except for Evans would serve on the committee, which he said signals the significance of their investigation and \u201cadds weight to what we are doing.\u201d The committee is to decide potential sanctions, based on the results of the investigation.\n\nMendelson said the lawyers have interviewed most of the witnesses in their investigation and expect to produce a report by the end of the month.\n\nThe council previously reprimanded Evans and stripped him of his committee chairmanship.\n\nEvans also resigned from the board of Metro after a different law firm hired by the transit agency found ethics violations.\n\nThe D.C. Council also unanimously approved emergency legislation to end nearly all cooperation between the District\u2019s jails and federal immigration enforcement \u2014 unless federal officials have a court order. A spokeswoman for the mayor said administration officials believed the bill \u201cinstitutionalizes our current posture.\u201d\n\nLawmakers also voted to strip the mayor of powers that allowed her to move the traffic camera program from the Police Department to the Transportation Department without council approval.\n\nThey backed emergency legislation by council member David Grosso (I-At Large) to rename Columbus Day as \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest jurisdiction to rethink honoring the European explorer because of his history of brutality toward Native Americans. Evans and Mendelson voted \u201cpresent,\u201d with the former citing opposition from constituents of Italian descent.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe District may impose one of the steepest soda taxes in the nation\n\nThousands of new e-scooters could be on their way to D.C. streets\n\nD.C. ethics agency mishandled whistleblower complaint, audit says\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Lawmakers unanimously backed the first stage to a new comprehensive plan.", "authors": ["Fenit Nirappil", "Reporter Covering D.C.
