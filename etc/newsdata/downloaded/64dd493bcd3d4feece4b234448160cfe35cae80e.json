'Cause when things get bad, when you get scared, you pick a target, aim and shoot.'\n\n'Me, Negan, anything but you.'\n\nNegan's escape couldn't have come at a worse time for the survivors, who'd recently been under siege by outside forces.\n\nVoluntary confinement: Lydia claimed that she set Negan free and put herself in a cell\n\nIn previous episodes, they battled a forest fire and had their outposts attacked by walkers.\n\nOn Sunday, a giant tree fell on a building at Hilltop, trapping people inside.\n\nSome thought The Whisperers were behind the assaults, especially as Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride) had just tried to kill their leader.\n\nNatural disaster: Ezekial [Khary Payton] was overwhelmed as a giant tree fell on a building at Hilltop, trapping people inside\n\nUnder attack: Walkers swarmed the area as the survivors were faced with yet another setback\n\nThe Whisperers responded by taking the survivors' hunting ground\u2014proof that they would seize whatever they wanted.\n\n'We're already at war,' noted a Hilltop resident. 'We just didn't know it yet.'\n\nAt Alexandria, Aaron (Ross Marquand) led the survivors through defense training.\n\nDefense training: At Alexandria, Aaron (Ross Marquand) led the survivors through defense training\n\n'Lose focus and you will get killed,' he said, as Lydia observed them. 'Remember these people took our friends, they took our land. They must be stopped, again.'\n\n'Hey Lydia!' shouted one survivor, Gage [Jackson Pace], pretending to don a Whisperers-style mask. 'You think mommy will take me in?'\n\n'Oh, right,' he added, removing it. 'She kicked your a** out. Now you're just a freak.'\n\nWhisperers mask: Gage [Jackson Pace] pretended to don a Whisperers-style mask and taunted Lydia\n\nLydia ran off to a corner of the camp, where Negan found her and consoled her.\n\n'They are trying to get a reaction out of you,' he said. 'They want to see you upset. Don't give that to 'em. Screw 'em.'\n\nDaryl found them talking, and took Lydia home, telling her 'He ain't your friend.'\n\nTaking off: Lydia fled the bullying and marched to another corner of camp\n\nOffering support: Negan found Lydia and consoled her\n\nGood advice: Lydia listened as Negan told her they were trying to get a reaction out of her\n\nAs they arrived at her door, they saw that it had been painted to say: 'Silence the Whispers.'\n\nInfuriated, Lydia later approached her bullies in the dining hall.\n\nShe slammed a forest animal down on their table and gutted it in front of them, causing blood to spurt onto Gage's face.\n\nDoor message: Daryl walked Lydia back home and they found graffiti scrawled on her door reading, 'Silence the Whispers'\n\nDining hall: Lydia approached her bullies in the dining hall\n\nForest animal: The outraged girl slammed a forest animal down on their table and gutted it in front of the bullies, causing blood to spurt onto Gage's face\n\n'Shhhh,' she said, putting a bloody finger to her lips.\n\nThat evening, they sought retribution, confronting her in the dark outside.\n\nMargo [Jerri Tubbs], one of her attackers, punched her as Lydia wriggled to get away.\n\n'Why do you hate me?' Lydia cried out.\n\nOutside attack: The bullies at night surrounded Lydia and attacked her\n\n'Cause you put my friends on spikes,' Margo answered.\n\n'I wasn't there,' Lydia protested.\n\nMargo suggested that Lydia run away, to which the teen replied: 'This is my home. You are my people.'\n\nRun away: Margo suggested that Lydia run away, to which the teen replied: 'This is my home. You are my people'\n\nAs all three of them descended on her, Negan suddenly appeared and shoved Margo out of the way.\n\nHe tried again to soothe the sobbing girl, saying, 'It's ok.'\n\nBehind him, Alfred (David Shae) tried to revive Margo, whose head was bloody where she fell.\n\n'Shit,' Negan said, as he realized she was dead.\n\nThe hero: Negan suddenly appeared and shoved Margo out of the way accidentally killing her\n\nSoon it seemed the whole community had shown up, with many wanting Negan punished.\n\n'He didn't do anything wrong,' Lydia repeated as she was taken from the scene.\n\nIn the infirmary, after she was patched up, Daryl tried to comfort her.\n\n'My dad would've protected me,' the girl said.\n\nNegan saved her life, she insisted, so Daryl went off to visit him in jail.\n\nJail visit: Daryl Dixon [Norman Reedus] visited Negan in jail after Lydia insisted that he saved her life\n\n'If you came here for a confession, keep walking,' Negan offered. 'It was an accident. And for the record, screw her. She was a goddamned a**hole, beating on a kid. World's better off.'\n\nNegan knew that Daryl, who'd long wanted to kill him, wasn't sure what to do.\n\nNegan had once decimated the survivors, killing or imprisoning them as the leader of The Saviors.\n\nBut by protecting Lydia, he may have ended up saving them all, as that name predicted.\n\nSaviors leader: Negan had once decimated the survivors, killing or imprisoning them as the leader of The Saviors\n\nMichonne [Danai Gurira] sensed that Alpha laid off them because they had her daughter.\n\n'Lydia's presence might not help us,' she theorized. 'But if Alpha thinks she isn't safe with us, or if Lydia runs off because of all this, it'll definitely hurt us. She has to stay at Alexandria.'\n\nAs he headed home from Negan's cell, Daryl ran into Carol sitting outside.\n\nStay safe: Michonne told Daryl to keep Lydia safe or her mother Alpha could hurt them\n\n'This is a distraction,' she mused, referring to Negan and Lydia.\n\n'Hilltop's got a tree through its walls. Alexandria was attacked. Our real enemy is out there.'\n\n'There's enough bad stuff happening in here,' Daryl worried. 'I'm afraid if we don't fix it, it ain't gonna matter what she does to us. There won't be anything left.'\n\nTough spot: Daryl wondered if there would be anything left to save\n\nAs he fretted, Michonne and Judith [Cailey Fleming] rode to Hilltop to help their friends, joined by Eugene Porter [Josh McDermitt] and other survivors.\n\nJudith wondered if their old enemy was trying to wear them out.\n\n'Maybe The Whisperers wanna keep us fighting back until we get so tired that they have the advantage,' she opined.\n\nRoad trip: Michonne and Judith [Cailey Fleming] rode to Hilltop to help their friends, joined by Eugene Porter [Josh McDermitt] and other survivors\n\nMichonne laughed, impressed by her the little girl's insights.\n\nThen she spotted Ezekiel [Khary Payton], riding off alone into the forest, and followed him.\n\nEzekiel had lately seemed traumatized, freezing up when the disaster at Hilltop happened.\n\nMichonne found him on a rickety platform in the woods, overlooking a ravine far below.\n\nLow point: Ezekiel was found by Michonne as he stood on a rickety platform in the woods, overlooking a ravine far below\n\nHe refused to budge, so she took his hand, saying, 'I'm not going anywhere.'\n\nEzekiel released a long, shaky breath. He turned, and she hugged him, adding, 'It's okay.'\n\nHe kissed Michonne, and she kissed him back for a minute, then pulled away.\n\nTender moment: Michonne and Ezekiel surprisingly kissed each other\n\n'I'm sorry,' he said. 'You know I didn't mean to.'\n\n'We never would've worked out anyway,' Michonne replied. 'Both too damn stubborn.'\n\nEzekiel shared that he'd been struggling after losing his kingdom, fianc\u00e9e, son, and pet tiger.\n\nToo stubborn: The sword-wielding leader told Ezekiel they were both too stubborn to make it work anyway\n\nMichonne related to that darkness, explaining she'd once been so far down her own personal hole that she dared walkers to bite her.\n\n'Next thing I know, my sword was chopping off its head like it has a damn mind of its own,' she recalled. 'So I put the sword down, kill 'em with my own bare hands. Eventually, I just gave up.'\n\n'It feels like a mask,' she explained. 'Until it doesn't.'\n\nFinal season: Michonne, played by Danai Gurira, has been on the show since season three and season 10 is her final season\n\n'My old mask saved my life,' claimed Ezekiel. 'But I can only wear it for so long.'\n\nMichonne teared up, aware that losing everything was 'harder the second time around\u2026 especially when you get used to having someone there, that partner-in-crime,' she affirmed, thinking of her lost love, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln).\n\n'Now it's all on you. Just you.'\n\nOpening up: Ezekiel and Michonne opened up about their lost loves\n\nShe urged Ezekiel not to go it alone, then praised his kissing skills, which made him laugh.\n\nTogether, they set off for Hilltop to fight the walkers encircling the property, but by the time they got there, the undead had broken through its gates.\n\nEzekiel ran into battle, shouting 'Defend the breach!' with Michonne close behind.\n\nSticking together: Michonne urged Ezekiel not to go it alone, then praised his kissing skills, which made him laugh.\n\nAs she looked around, she saw Judith killing walkers right alongside her, and was proud.\n\nBack at Alexandria, the community's council convened to decide what to do with Negan.\n\n'I get why people might think Negan's been redeemed,' Aaron told the group. 'I've wondered it myself. Hell, maybe he has changed.'\n\nCommunity council: Aaron during a community council meeting argued that Negan was broken\n\n'But a man like that who's done the things he's done, killed the people he's killed, something inside him is broken. We need to face that fact.'\n\n'Yes, but killing him now over this undermines the civilization that we have built,' Siddiq [Avi Nash] responded.\n\n'What if other people never get to witness that civilization because of him?' Aaron asked.\n\nCounter point: Siddiq [Avi Nash] argued that killing Negan would undermine their mission\n\n'What the hell are you even talking about?' Siddiq replied. 'The Whisperers are attacking us. Look at what's going on at Hilltop. We are taking our eyes of the ball.'\n\n'The council wasn't made for this: Deciding on a man's life in the dead of night, because people are carrying pitchforks and torches,' said Father Gabriel Stokes [Seth Gilliam].\n\nDaryl, acting as Michonne's proxy, felt they'd better decide before others did it for them.\n\nTough decision: Father Gabriel Stokes [Seth Gilliam] was considering his vote and went to talk to Negan\n\n'Lydia said he saved her, so he saved her,' he declared. 'I'm a no.'\n\nGabriel went to talk to Negan the next day, and found him gone.\n\nLydia then lay down in his prison cell, telling everyone she helped him escape.\n\n'C'mon,' Daryl said. 'You didn't do this. I kept watch last night. You never left the house.'\n\n'Does it matter?' she asked resignedly. 'This is where they want me.'\n\nEscape helper: Lydia claimed that she helped Negan, but Daryl said he was on watch and she never left the house\n\nThat morning, Michonne told her group that she was lighting out for Oceanside after getting a call that a survivor there had seen a Whisperer nearby.\n\n'You know as well as I do, they move as a pack,' she said, adding that Judith was going with her.\n\n'So you think they're planning an attack?' asked Yumiko [Eleanor Matsuura].\n\n'Walkers at Alexandria, the tree here, and now Oceanside?' Michonne considered. 'First time, coincidence. Second time might be bad luck. But the third time, we should check.'\n\nHe's back: Ezekiel returned and told Jerry [Cooper Andrews] that he was fine\n\nConvertible ride: Michonne, Judith and Luke left for Oceanside together\n\nLooking out: Carol Peletier watched from above", "description": "Negan escaped after saving Lydia from attack by her fellow survivors on Sunday's episode of The Walking Dead.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/07/20269502-0-image-a-142_1572246640980.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
