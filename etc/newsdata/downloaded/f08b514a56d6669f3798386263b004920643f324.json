Among the most talked-about relatives are Prince Andrew's daughters are Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, two of William and Harry's first cousins.\n\nThe royal sisters have frequented headlines lately, especially because of their respective engagement and wedding news. Most recently, Beatrice announced her plans to marry Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, with a wedding set for 2020. Before the two say \"I do\" next year, here's what you need to know about the bride-to-be's royal title, what it means, and how it might change when she gets married.\n\nWhat is Princess Beatrice's official royal title?\n\nBeatrice's official royal title is Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice of York. This is because her father, Prince Andrew, is also the Duke of York.\n\nHer middle names are Elizabeth Mary, making her full name Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary of York, which appears on her birth certificate.\n\nPhoto credit: Mark Cuthbert - Getty Images More\n\nWhy is she a princess?\n\nA Letters Patent issued by King George V in 1917 states that the sovereign's grandchildren can have \"prince\" or \"princess\" royal titles. Beatrice and Eugenie both qualify because they're granddaughters of Queen Elizabeth II (as daughters of Prince Andrew, the queen's son).\n\nNot all of the queen's grandchildren have royal titles. For example, Beatrice and Eugenie's cousin, Zara Tindall\u2014who is also the queen's granddaughter and Princess Anne's daughter\u2014doesn't have one. Apparently, the sovereign offered to give Anne's children the honor, but Anne declined.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Here's what we know about her regal moniker.", "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TaehqTwcnm0qCjNuvS8qbQ--~B/aD03MjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/harper_s_bazaar_391/af173a92ec77488903861ba533cb12fb", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
