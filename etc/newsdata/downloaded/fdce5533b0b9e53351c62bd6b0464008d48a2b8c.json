We may make some progress in that department as a slow-moving cold front hangs around the next several days, although a good dousing may elude us. Highs are mainly in the 70s today and tomorrow, then a bit cooler into midweek.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

But morning readings rising into the 60s, and afternoon highs in the mid-70s, still feel might nice after the recent spate of heat. Skies are mostly to partly cloudy ahead of a cold front slowly approaching from the west. Could see a few light showers or sprinkles through the course of the day. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nTonight: The chance remains of a few light showers or sprinkles during the evening into the overnight. Otherwise, skies stay mostly to partly cloudy as evening temperatures drop back into the 60s. Some patchy fog is possible overnight with lows in the low-to-mid 60s. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through the midweek...\n\nTomorrow (Monday): The morning continues the chance of a few light showers or sprinkles, with a better chance of scattered showers during the afternoon into evening as the cold front crosses the area. Highs should reach the 70s to near 80 under partly to mostly cloudy skies, before temperatures fall back to the 60s toward evening. Any rain is good rain at this point, although it could coincide with Nats-Dodgers Game 4 scheduled to start at 6:40 p.m. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nTomorrow night: With the front slow to move through, scattered showers remain possible during the evening, and possibly into the overnight. Can\u2019t say for sure if the rain would be heavy enough to disrupt Nats-Dodgers Game 4, but we\u2019ll watch it as we get closer. Evening temperatures drop through the 60s as winds pick up from the north behind the front, with overnight lows dipping to the mid-50s to near 60 under mostly to partly cloudy skies. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nA LOOK AHEAD\n\nThe front may remain close enough to our south and east Tuesday to keep us under mostly to partly cloudy skies with a continued chance of showers. Temperatures trend cooler with highs in the mid-60s to near 70. We\u2019ll hold on to the chance of scattered showers Tuesday night with lows in the 50s. Confidence: Low-Medium\n\nA few more showers may linger into Wednesday. But we could see drier and brighter conditions work in later in the day if high pressure has any success nudging its way in from the north. Highs should again reach around the mid-60s to near 70.
