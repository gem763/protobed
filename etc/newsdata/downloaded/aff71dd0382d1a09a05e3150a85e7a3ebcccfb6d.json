That's probably the strangest place.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Sometimes people panic and say the wrong thing. I'll walk in and they'll try and get the catchphrase out quickly and instead say something like, 'Let the table see the shoes.'\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"It's nice that they know it, that's the thing. With a phrase like Bruce Forsyth's 'Nice to see you, to see you nice', you know what the show is just by hearing that sentence.\n\n\"When people hear 'No likey, no lighty', even if it's out of context, they know exactly what show it's referring to.\"\n\nThe Farnworth native has also recently taken on a Top Gear presenting gig, alongside former England cricketer Freddie Flintoff.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nHe'll next be gracing our telly screens with the newest series of Take Me Out, which kicks off on Saturday night.\n\nPaddy's happy that the 11th series has seen a few shake ups, including two themed specials - one 80s-themed, and the other for the men and women of the emergency services.\n\nChatting about the specials, Paddy said: \"We've done an over-50s special in the past, but this is the decade, it's celebrating the 80s, so I've gone back to my Miami Vice days.\n\n\"I'll be in a white suit with a pastel vest and all the girls will have big hair. The music and everything about the show will be 80s.\n\n\"I'm really looking forward to that, it'll be a lot of fun.\"\n\nHe said of the emergency services episode: \"All the girls work within the emergency services and all the lads coming down the lift do as well. We thought it'd be a nice idea to celebrate them and everything they do.\"\n\nTake Me Out returns on ITV on Saturday 26th October at 7:15pm.", "description": "Paddy was at a funeral when someone used a variation of his Take Me Out catchphrase that he reckoned was seriously inappropriate", "authors": ["Will Twigger", "Image", "Pa", "Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20671868.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TAKE-ME-OUT.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
