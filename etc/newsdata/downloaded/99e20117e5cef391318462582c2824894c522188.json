The program will be administered by WEG Bank AG\u2019s new fintech brand, TEN31.\n\nHe added the program will start with bitcoin, litecoin and several other undisclosed crypto assets. Last week the bank offered NIM and TPAY to people who participated in a Twitter contest.\n\nSpeaking to broader plans for 2020 and beyond, von Hauff added:\n\n\u201cWe will not limit ourselves to just point-of-sale terminals. We will do online checkout, ATMs and we are currently investigating the option to integrate a [crypto] exchange into the bank as well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which exchange the bank may be able to integrate with in the future. For one, the stakeholding Nimiq Foundation is working on such technology, called the OASIS initiative, with the Malta-based decentralized exchange (DEX) startup Agora Trade.\n\n\u201cWhat we envision with OASIS is that we are able to create a non-custodial connection between the blockchain world and the traditional bank or bank-account world,\u201d Nimiq co-founder Elion Chin told CoinDesk. \u201cThe goal is to have the first OASIS mainnet test with WEG Bank AG and Agora by 2020.\u201d\n\nAs for other prospective DEXs, TokenPay also owns equity in the DEX startup eFIN.\n\n\u201cWe are looking forward to working with WEG Bank to integrate eFIN, a cross-chain noncustodial DEX,\u201d TokenPay CEO Derek Capo told CoinDesk.\n\nNimiq and TokenPay were both funded by initial coin offerings (ICOs). According to the Nimiq transparency report from September 2019, the project\u2019s team spent roughly $3.8 million worth of the $12.8 million garnered during the 2017 ICO on 9.9 percent equity in WEG Bank AG. The other two crypto companies involved with the TEN31 project own the same amount of equity, although the Litecoin Foundation received its shares for free from TokenPay.\n\nRegardless of the many brand names now involved, WEG Bank AG itself will be the regulated entity facilitating compliant services.\n\n\u201cThis solution will make the on-boarding to get into crypto much smoother,\u201d Nimiq\u2019s Chin said, adding:\n\n\u201cMy hope would be that this type of solution would make it smoother, faster, easier, to the point where my parents would get comfortable with it too.\u201d\n\nWEG Bank AG CEO Matthias von Hauff (right) image via Twitter", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/D9UygBLXYAAF1Ra-2.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
