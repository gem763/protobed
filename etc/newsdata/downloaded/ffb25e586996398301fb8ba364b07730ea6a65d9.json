Photo: Courtesy of the vendor\n\nWe\u2019ve argued in the past that the anthurium \u2014 the waxy, vaguely suggestive flower that can be found in almost every tastefully appointed store in New York (Mansur Gavriel, Totokaelo, Glossier) \u2014 is the perfect candidate for buying faux instead of fresh. The real version is terribly expensive (nearly $20 a stem), and looks more or less fake to begin with. This Urban Outfitters bloom is bright, believable (the spadix is speckled with faux water drops: realistic!), and at $3 (everything in the site\u2019s sale section is an additional 40 percent off right now), it\u2019s $17 less than the real deal. Plus, there are some very pretty vases on sale to put them in, like this long-necked milk glass one, or this very charming turquoise mini (both $15, down from $29).\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
