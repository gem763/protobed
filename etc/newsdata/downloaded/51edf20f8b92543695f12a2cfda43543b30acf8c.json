So why have they forced through a delay of as much as three months?\n\nThe answer lies in their fear that granting the deal approval now would paradoxically open up a two-week window in which a no-deal Brexit once more becomes possible.\n\nThe Benn Act, designed to block no-deal, ceases to have effect as soon as the meaningful vote has passed.\n\nBut in order to implement his deal, Mr Johnson must also have it ratified in parliament by passing a Withdrawal Agreement Bill through both houses.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
