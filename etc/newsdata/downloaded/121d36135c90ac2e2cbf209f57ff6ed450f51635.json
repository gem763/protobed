REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that it looked like Iran was responsible for attacks over the weekend on Saudi Arabian oil plants, but he was in no rush to respond and was still trying to find out who was behind the strikes.\n\nSeveral U.S. cabinet officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, have blamed Tehran for the attacks, which cut 5% of world crude oil production.\n\nIran has denied blame, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani saying the strike was carried out by \u201cYemeni people\u201d retaliating to attacks by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen\u2019s four-year-old war.\n\nTrump said the United States had a lot of options to respond to the attacks, but declined to say what measures he was considering. He added that, while the United States could help, he had not promised protection to Riyadh.\n\nThe attacks on Saudi Arabia have damaged the globe\u2019s largest crude processing plant and triggered the biggest jump in oil prices in nearly 30 years.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that it looked like Iran was responsible for attacks over the weekend on Saudi Arabian oil plants, but he was in no rush to respond and was still trying to find out who was behind the strikes.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430573565&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F1IH", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
