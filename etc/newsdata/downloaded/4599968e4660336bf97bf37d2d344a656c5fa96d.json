The group immediately launched a competing event, called Iowa\u2019s Ride, which will be held next July during the same week that the Register\u2019s ride had been scheduled.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the Register\u2019s ride, known as RAGBRAI, would continue. The weeklong event draws thousands of cyclists from around the country and had been founded by Register employees in the 1970s.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gannett, the Register\u2019s parent company, didn\u2019t immediately respond to inquiries.\n\nThe ride\u2019s longtime director, T.J. Juskiewicz, said in a statement that organizers were upset with the Register and Gannett\u2019s handling of criticism following a story involving fundraiser Carson King.\n\nKing became a social media sensation when he held up a sign outside the Iowa-Iowa State football game asking for money to buy more Busch Light beer. When he started receiving donations, he decided to give the money to the Iowa Children\u2019s Hospital. The fundraiser became wildly popular and ultimately raised $3 million.\n\nThe newspaper faced criticism for discovering and asking King about racially insensitive tweets he sent when he was a teenager. Anheuser Busch cut ties with King even before the Register reported on the tweets, and King held a news conference to apologize. Readers were angry that the Register felt it was relevant to dig up the tweets. They reacted with fury toward Iowa\u2019s largest newspaper, especially after the reporter was found to have sent his own offensive tweets years ago. The reporter, Aaron Calvin, was fired, even as Register editor Carol Hunter largely defended its reporting methods.\n\nThe backlash created a public relations problem for RAGBRAI, which faced some calls for a boycott. The ride publicly praised King and pledged $50,000 to the children\u2019s hospital last month.\n\nJuskiewicz said in a statement that he was directed in recent weeks by Gannett leaders to stay quiet or stick to talking points when addressing criticism about the King story.\n\n\u201cIn these past few weeks, my efforts to communicate with our loyal riders has been consistently blocked as it did not mesh with the company\u2019s PR narrative to spin the Carson King embarrassment,\u201d he wrote in an online statement. \u201cThere are hundreds of questions that have been left unanswered in an attempt to save face for the Register, without regard to how it affects RAGBRAI.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Organizers of the popular summer bike ride across Iowa are cutting ties with its longtime sponsor, the Des Moines Register, amid backlash over the newspaper's handling of a story.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ryan J.
