Does this issue matter to you? Does NR\u2019s relentless devotion to life matter to you? Do you know, as Rich Lowry points out emphatically, that our Alexandra DeSanctis has emerged as the most important and thorough writer on the life issues in America?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf this all matters, then let us ask, as we start to round the final turn in NR\u2019s 2019 Spring Webathon, that you too find it within you to support NR, as have some 950-plus kind readers since May 1. Our goal is to raise $175,000, and we are about 60 per cent of the way there. Who has helped us along the way? People like the following, who give, and explain:\n\nBrian gives 100 bucks and speaks of a love affair lasting over half a century: \u201cI have been reading National Review since college, over 50 years. I still remember joining the campaign to Horsewhip Drew Pearson. Cheers.\u201d If we could only locate that horsewhip, Brian, we could repurpose it for plenty of others.\n\nThat is echoed by Leslie, who sported us $50 and an admission of abiding affection: \u201cI\u2019ve loved National Review for decades. Keep up the good work of articulating my thoughts so much better than I can.\u201d\n\nJohn reaches into the wallet, grabs $25 and has this to say: \u201cThank you NRO for all of the top-shelf commentary and reporting. I find myself checking the site every day for the latest take on American and foreign politics and policy. Please keep up the great work!\u201d Ahh Johnny Boy, if everyone who thought like you acted as you have.\n\nJonathan rains $500 in kindness, and piles on a heap of formal praise: \u201cThank you for all that you do, and all your hard work, especially to Mr. Fowler, Mr. Lowry, Mr. Cooke, Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Williamson, Mr. Ponnuru, Mr. French, Miss DeSanctis, Mr. Smith, Miss Timpf, Mr. Cost, Mr. Geraghty, and Miss Kearns. National Review remains a constant point of light ahead in an otherwise increasingly inky sky. And as Lactantius said, constancy is a virtue.\u201d Did he now? Thank you Mr. Jonathan!\n\nNext comes Jim, who spots us $100 and outs himself, a brave move in Cuomostan: \u201cAs a conservative in New York State, National Review is essential reading and has been for nearly twenty years. How could I not contribute to a magazine that has allowed me to read, and now listen, to a who\u2019s who of conservative intellectuals. Thank you!\u201d Jim, you didn\u2019t have to, but you did \u2013 we hope that inspires others.\n\nWe are loving this: a hefty $200 from Nicholas, who has the grooviest of conservative fantasies: \u201cIn gratitude for the fantastic journalism found within these pages and high-quality, entertaining, and informative podcasts. From the pro-life work of Alexandra DeSanctis to the literary delight that is every Kevin D Williamson article; the good folks at NRO make me want to shoot guns with Charlie, go to church in Tennessee with David (and I\u2019m Catholic!), Sing Irish songs with MBD, smoke a cigar with Jonah Goldberg, and take in a three martini lunch with Jim Geraghty. Keep fighting the good fight!\u201d\n\nTalk about a bucket list! Which spurs an idea: Dinner in NYC with Rich and a couple of writers for anyone who tenders a very generous $10,000 or more as part of this Webathon. And it will be a nice dinner. In a choice NYC restaurant. And we\u2019ll make MBD sing. And maybe drag Kyle Smith along and force him to do harmony.\n\nWe\u2019re serious. (Well, not about the singing.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut we are about our real needs: Especially if you find our pro-life bona fides important, please give what you can, knowing your selfless generosity is truly consequential. We\u2019ve got little more than a week to reach our goal of $175,000: Help us get there by donating to the 2019 Spring Webathon here. If you wish to send a check, make it payable to \u201cNational Review\u201d and mail it to National Review, ATTN: Spring 2019 Webathon, 19 West 44th Street, New York, NY 10036.\n\nThank you very much.", "description": "Does NR\u2019s relentless devotion to life matter to you?
