It is done all the time,\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThis has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens,\u201d he added. \u201cThis does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\nTrump had declared Thursday from the White House lawn that the Chinese and Ukrainian governments should investigate unfounded accusations of corruption against the Bidens \u2014 despite facing an impeachment inquiry for pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to do just that during a phone call in July.\n\nAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries.

We\u2019ve cut through the denials. The deflections. The nonsense,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cDonald Trump believes he can pressure a foreign nation to help him politically. It\u2019s his \u2018right.\u2019 Every Republican in Congress has to decide: Is he right?\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s morning missive came as Washington awoke to news of damaging text messages exchanged in recent months among top American diplomats.
