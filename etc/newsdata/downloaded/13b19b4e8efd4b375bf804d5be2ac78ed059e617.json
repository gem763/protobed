We lost a big slab of supply from the market which put upwards pressure on prices and worsens reliability. It also makes the market less competitive.\n\n\"It was disastrous and we can't afford that to happen again.\"\n\nLike Victoria, coal-rich Queensland has an ambitious renewable energy target of 50 per cent by 2030.\n\nThe state-based targets have been criticised by the Morrison government, which says they distort the NEM and make the grid more unreliable.\n\nBut Dr Lynham said the upgraded closure date for the 700 megawatt Callide B \u2013 which was commissioned in 1989 \u2013 was based on new technical specifications rather than a directive from government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While AEMO has previously used the typical technical life of generators, the information it now requires is based on the technical characteristics of specific assets,\" Dr Lynham said.\n\n\"Our generators are the newest in the National Electricity Market and are well maintained to ensure their reliability.\"\n\nQueensland Resources Minister Anthony Lynham says the state is on track to reach its 50 per cent renewable target. Attila Csaszar\n\nAccording to AEMO's latest database of generating unit closures, the state-owned 1680 megawatt Gladstone power station will stay open for five more years than expected, now closing in 2035.\n\nAnother state-owned coal-fired power station in Queensland, the 1400 megawatt Tarong, will close in 2036-37 as planned, while the newer 1445 megawatt Stanwell plant, which was only commissioned in 1993, will not close until 2044-45.\n\nAEMO was hoping to sequence the closure of coal power plants to meet emissions targets, but was forced to abandon its plans after push back from big energy companies like Origin Energy.\n\nEnergy companies are required to update AEMO on their proposals for closure dates for coal and gas-fired generators.\n\nThe big energy companies are also feeling the pressure from the Morrison government over the proposed closure dates for older coal-fired power stations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAGL Energy announced it would move the closure of its Liddell power station in NSW from late 2022 to early 2023 to get through the high-demand summer months.\n\nThe Morrison and Berejiklian government in August launched a Liddell taskforce to look at possible replacements for the closure of the power plant, to ensure there was not a repeat of the Hazelwood closure.\n\nOther key coal-fired power plant closures in the NEM include Sunset Power's Vales Point in 2028, EnergyAustralia's Yallourn plant in Victoria in 2032 and AGL Energy's Bayswater in 2035.\n\nWhen asked whether the forced closure of coal-fired power stations was his greatest fear as energy minister, Mr Taylor replied, \"yes\".\n\nHe said while the government was doing all it can to boost new generation, including gas, into the market, existing coal and gas-fired power plants should be kept in the NEM as long as possible.\n\n\"New projects are commissioned for a number of years, so in the meantime the key is keeping our existing generators flat-out which is why we set up the Liddell taskforce,\" he said.\n\n\"The goal is simple \u2013 extension or like-for-like replacement. You can't play games with this. It's got to be about keeping the supply and competition in the market place.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the Coalition government comes under pressure for how it will meet the Paris international climate targets, Mr Taylor stood by the use of \"carry-over\" credits from the Kyoto agreement to count towards Australia's commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030.\n\nCritics said it was not in the spirit of the Paris agreement and was only delaying tougher cuts after 2030.\n\nBut Mr Taylor said it was about getting the balance right.\n\n\"There are only two ways to reduce emissions at the end of the day. Reduce the intensity of those sectors and businesses or shut those industries down,\" he said.\n\n\"Our message has been very clear, we are not going to trash industries.\"\n\nIt comes as TasNetworks said a new 1500 megawatt Marinus Link connecting Tasmania to the mainland was technically feasible.\n\n\"A 1500 megawatt Marinus Link represents an increase in capacity of 300 megawatts from the previous modelled capacity of 1200 megawatts,\" TasNetworks chief executive Lance Balcombe said on Sunday.\n\n\"The design ensures that this capacity can be supported by both the Tasmanian and Victorian power systems.\"\n\nThe Morrison government is keen for a second connection to Tasmania to allow the island state's excess electricity from its pumped hydro assets - dubbed \"battery of the nation\" \u2013 be used on the mainland.", "description": "The Queensland government will close its Callide B coal-fired power station in 2028, but said it's nothing to do with reaching its 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.577%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_82/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/34b21c0af48d08d38355946de0c6bf9da62d1ad5", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
