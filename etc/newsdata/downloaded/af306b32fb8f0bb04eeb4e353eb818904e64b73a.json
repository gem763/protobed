In the midst of a lackluster episode, his brief appearance on Weekend Update offered some desperately needed laughs \u2014 and exposed one of the show\u2019s long-held weaknesses.\n\nSNL\u2019s lack of diversity has long been an issue. Putting aside the basic ethical and moral problems inherent in that, the show\u2019s lack of diversity had an immediate practical effect: It has often impeded what characters the live show can portray. The problem was so blatant, in fact, that the show took aim at itself in 2013 when Kerry Washington played a series of prominent black women in the same sketch. As Soraya Nadia McDonald wrote for The Washington Post at the time:\n\nThe show opened with Washington playing Michelle Obama, who suddenly had to leave so that Oprah Winfrey could visit with the president. Kerry reappeared as Winfrey, then dashed backstage to morph into Beyonc\u00e9, while appearing appropriately put out with all the dashing being asked of her. During the skit, \u201cSNL\u201d superimposed this statement: The producers at \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d would like to apologize to Kerry Washington for the number of black women she will be asked to play tonight. We made these requests both because Ms. Washington is an actress of considerable range and talent and also because \u201cSNL\u201d does not currently have a black woman in the cast. As for the latter reason, we agree that this is not an ideal situation and look forward to rectifying it in the near future \u2026 unless of course, we fall in love with another white guy first.\n\nUntil recently, the show struggled with depicting almost any public figures who weren\u2019t white. Yang\u2019s hilarious Weekend Update segment highlights how much we\u2019ve missed out on over the years.\n\nMichael Che set the segment up, announcing \u201cNext week, China is set to visit the White House and discuss this ongoing trade war. Here to comment is Chinese trade representative Chen Biao.\u201d Cue a besuited and bespectacled Yang, who brought along a picnic basket of attitude. He opens by speaking in Chinese, prompting Che to ask if he speaks English.\n\n\u201cYes. Fluently. And that\u2019s what\u2019s called a power move,\u201d Yang\u2019s Biao answers, before screaming \u201cWHAT\u2019S UP CHE?!\u201d\n\nThroughout the sketch, Yang masterfully modulated his voice and tone, always poking fun at whatever Che asks him. When Che wonders if he\u2019s stressed out thanks to the ongoing trade war, Yang becomes almost coquettish when he says, \u201cYou guys increase taxes on our imports. We increase taxes on yours. Meanwhile, I\u2019m in the middle of it all, and you know I hate the attention. JK! I\u2019m balling out right now, cuz I\u2019m the top tariff taskmaster.\u201d\n\nA surprised Che says what everyone\u2019s thinking: \u201cI gotta say, this is not the attitude I expected from a top Chinese government official.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, well, I\u2019m running tariffs, so this is my time. I\u2019m having my moment. I\u2019m basically the Lizzo of China right now,\u201d he replies. \u201cAnd turns out I\u2019m 100 percent that trade daddy.\u201d\n\nEmbedded in the over-the-top performance is some sharp political satire, the exact sort missing from the tired cold open which did a fine job of reminding us of the week\u2019s headlines but didn\u2019t really add anything to them. Here, the show has fun with news while trying to make some salient points.\n\n[And this week\u2019s \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 cold open celebrity guest star is . . . Matthew Broderick as Mike Pompeo]\n\nChe skeptically asks Yang\u2019s Biao if China can keep the trade war going on forever, and Biao assures him that it would be no problem. \u201cYou need us more than we need you, because we can survive without your movies starring The Rock, but good luck without iPhones. How are you gonna text us in the middle of the night like, \u2018You up? Can you investigate Joe Biden for me?\u2019 Stupid.\u201d\n\nChe then points out that Americans fear the trade war might cause a recession and wonders if China feels the same way. You guessed it \u2014 they sure don\u2019t. \u201cNo way, fam. In fact, we just waived our tariff on American soybeans, so save some of your tempeh for us, MacKenzie!\u201d Who\u2019s MacKenzie, you might ask? Biao doesn\u2019t know either. Probably \u201csome sophomore at Vassar who like drinks out of a metal straw and it\u2019s such a performance.\u201d\n\nFinally, Biao just says, \u201cThis trade war is tit-for-tat, baby, and in China we got some tig ole bitties. I\u2019m talking back pain. \u2026 Look Don Don, you wanna play ball with Big Red? We actually built our wall. And you can see ours from space. And we measure time in dynasties, and you measure it in seasons of \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe bit was brief, funny and took some clever satirical shots. This might be an obvious statement, but it\u2019s an important one: Before Yang joined the cast, they never could have staged it. If the bit taught us anything, though, it\u2019s that we\u2019re going to see a lot more of Yang in the coming weeks, and we can\u2019t wait.", "description": "We\u2019re going to see a lot more of Yang in the coming weeks, and we can\u2019t wait.", "authors": ["Travis M.
