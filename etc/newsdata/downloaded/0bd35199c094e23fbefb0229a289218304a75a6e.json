Royal Australian Air Force/Facebook\n\n\"The C-17A will conduct passes over the Brisbane River and the [Central Business District] as the pilots expertly maneuver the aircraft as part of the preparation for Riverfire display,\" the RAAF said in a statement, referring to this past weekend's Sunsuper Riverfire and flight demonstration, which included flyovers from some Super Hornets as well.\n\n\"Each flying display is planned and flown beforehand and the pilots train to a high skill level to perform such maneuver,\" the statement continues. \"The aircraft will be at least 100 meters clear of terrain or any buildings during the display. The flying display will provide the public a great opportunity to take photos of the aircraft.\"\n\nA No. 1 Squadron F/A-18F Super Hornet over Brisbane for Sunsuper Riverfire 2019 while crowds on apartment balconies look on.

The photos published to the official RAAF Facebook page of Aussie aircraft buzzing buildings are impressive enough to put Maverick to shame:", "description": "An Australian C-17 rehearsed low-level flying through Brisbane as the warnings \"terrain, terrain, terrain\" and \"obstacle ahead\" blared in the cockpit.", "authors": ["James Clark", "Task"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9241152e22af4bb53047ce?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
