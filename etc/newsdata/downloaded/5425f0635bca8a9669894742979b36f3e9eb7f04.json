It reached the port of Pevek, an Arctic town across from Alaska, on September 14. From there, it will start generating enough electricity for an estimated 100,000 homes.\n\nThe plant could spur other nations to acquire floating nuclear power plants of their own, but environmentalists worry about the safety of such facilities. Under extreme circumstances, some activists have said, an environmental disaster such as a tsunami could trigger a nuclear explosion at sea.\n\nNuclear experts at the environmental nonprofit Greenpeace have dubbed the floating plant \"Chernobyl on ice,\" a reference to the 1986 nuclear disaster that led to widespread contamination across Europe.\n\nTake a look at how the world's first floating nuclear power plant came to life.", "description": "Environmentalists have criticized the concept of floating nuclear plants, arguing that they could be harder to reach during an accident.", "authors": ["Aria Bendix"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8a4cfe2e22af0a982e8ee9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
