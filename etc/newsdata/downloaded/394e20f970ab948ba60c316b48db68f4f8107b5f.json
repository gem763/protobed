I don\u2019t believe the current deal offers any benefits at all.\u201d\n\n___\n\n10 a.m.\n\nOpposition leader Jeremy Corbyn has told Parliament that the Brexit deal on which lawmakers are voting risks jobs, rights, the environment and the health service.\n\nThe Labour Party leader told Parliament Saturday that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s new deal is substantially worse than the one it replaces, which was voted down three times.\n\nCorbyn says it removes protection for workers\u2019 rights and the environment and replaces them with empty promises. He says it would also reduce Britain\u2019s commitment to fighting climate change.\n\nHe also warns it would hurt British manufacturing.\n\n___\n\n9:50 a.m.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Parliament that his new Brexit deal can heal the rift in British politics and unite warring factions.\n\nHe used a rare Saturday session to plead with lawmakers to back the new plan.\n\nHe says it would \u201ctake back control\u201d of Britain\u2019s borders, fishing and trade and preserve the gains of the Good Friday agreement that helped end violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nJohnson faces a close vote on his plan with opposition parties determined to block it.\n\n___\n\n9:40 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to get Parliament to approve his Brexit deal with the European Union has been thrown into doubt.\n\nLawmakers will first vote on whether to withhold approval until legislation to implement the agreement has been passed. That would bring another law into play that would force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay from the European Union.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow said would allow a vote on an amendment that essentially puts the vote on the deal off until another day.\n\nThose behind the amendment say it will remove the risk that the U.K. could stumble out of the bloc without a deal on Oct. 31 because the law is not in place.\n\nThe vote is due later Saturday.\n\n___\n\n8:40 a.m.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit plan faces what is expected to be an extremely tight vote as Britain\u2019s Parliament prepares for its first Saturday session since the 1982 Falklands war.\n\nAt stake is a new divorce plan agreed between the British government and the other 27 European Union nations at a summit Thursday.\n\nJohnson hopes for success in getting a fractious Parliament to back the deal after his predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get lawmakers behind her plan.\n\nJohnson does not have a parliamentary majority but he is hoping to woo some opposition Labour Party lawmakers to his side.\n\nHe said in The Sun newspaper on Saturday that a vote for the plan would bring a \u201cpainful chapter in our history\u201d to an end.", "description": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Brexit (all times local): 11:50 a.m. Thousands of Brexit opponents are gathering in central London to call for Britain to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/19/7c05c5_aptopix-britain-brexit-69997-an-anti-brexit-protestor-an-eu-flag-are-protest-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
