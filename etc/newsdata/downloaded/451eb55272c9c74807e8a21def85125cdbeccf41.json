You're living in a world inside a world. You've got no contact with the outside world.\n\n\"The only way to stop contact is to kill curiosity, and the only way to do that is basically to drill into you from when you were born that you're useless, you're worthless, you're ugly. Unfortunately with a cult like that, where you are outside of the law, it's a safe haven for some abusive, violent adults.\"\n\nThe Children of God began in the United States in the late 1960s and built on the 'free love' philosophy of counter-culture America.\n\nIts founder, David Berg, told members that God was love and love was sex, so there should be no limits, regardless of age or relationship.\n\nBy the 1970s Berg's cult claimed to have 10,000 full-time members in 130 communities around the world.\n\nHollywood stars Rose McGowan and Joaquin Phoenix were born into it.\n\nIn Scotland, it operated at sites in Renfrewshire, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and Edinburgh.\n\nVerity says she was abused from the age of four by her father and other cult members and she hopes that by speaking out it will encourage others to come forward to expose the actions of The Family.\n\nImage caption Jonathan says the cult had total control over his life as a child\n\nDuring their upbringing, the siblings say they were frequently moved to different properties where \"communes\" had been set up.\n\nThese were often in parts of the Scottish countryside with nothing for miles around and the children were deliberately never told of their exact location.\n\nVerity says the adults in the communes would have \"cult names\" - often Biblical and frequently unrelated to their true identity - which has presented issues in trying to gather evidence of their abuse.\n\nWhile staying in the communes, the pair say there was some contact with the \"systemites\" in the outside world - especially social workers - but they were well-prepared for them.\n\n\"They were very well scripted [for us],\" Verity says. \"They even dressed us in nice clothes - I remember I used to wear a dress with ribbons when the school inspector was coming.\"\n\nDespite being younger than his sister, it was Jonathan who was first to leave the cult.\n\nVerity was only told that her brother had been \"excommunicated for incurable demon possession\".\n\nHowever, Jonathan says he was ejected from the group after having a \"total mental breakdown\" at the age of 14.\n\n\"They tried to pray the demons out of me and it didn't work,\" he says. \"Ultimately they had to excommunicate me - but they had to force me out.\"\n\nImage caption Jonathan was excommunicated from the cult at 14\n\nDespite being free from the cult, Jonathan struggled to cope after he left.\n\nHe says: \"I basically continued to follow The Family rules inside my own head as I couldn't accept the outside world.\"\n\nEventually, it led to him becoming homeless at the age of 16.\n\n\"I was on the streets three weeks before my 16th birthday, with a change of clothes, a bag and nowhere to sleep that night,\" he says. \"Although it was terrifying, in a way it was what I needed.\"\n\nAfter years of abuse, Verity also wanted to leave.\n\n\"When I hit 15, I had already tried to commit suicide on three occasions and had attempted to run away twice,\" she says. \"I had reached the point where it didn't matter anymore because, however bad the outside world might be, what difference could it possibly make?\"\n\nShe says she decided to get herself thrown out by gathering items which were forbidden by The Family such as cigarettes, make-up, jewellery and chewing gum. After being confronted by adults about her stash, Verity was deliberately unrepentant - and started laughing when they tried to perform an \"exorcism\" on her.\n\n\"One of the adults in the home, his name was Paul, came up to punish me and he had his belt off and he wanted me to drop my trousers,\" she says. \"Then he started chasing me around the room, and as I was running away, I grabbed the belt off him and started hitting him back.\n\n\"I'd never done anything like this, I'd never stuck up for myself in this way. I'd said 'no' before, but I never really felt I had the right to do it. I'd never fought for myself.\"\n\nImage caption Verity was moved around \"communes\" in different parts of Scotland\n\nWhen she left The Family in the early 1990s, Verity struggled with alcohol and drugs in an attempt to block out her childhood experiences.\n\nShe says: \"I changed my lifestyle when I had kids but, to be honest, it is probably sheer luck that I survived those first few years out of the cult.\"\n\nThe pair hope that by raising awareness of what happened to them, it might encourage other survivors to contact the police and other authorities with their stories.\n\nVerity says: \"So many of them (survivors) don't feel like there's any point in speaking up about it.\n\n\"But I know for myself, when I finally did find my voice, it did give me a bit of closure.\"\n\nThe remnants of the group continue to have a presence online, now known as The Family International.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \"Although the Family International has apologised on a number of occasions to former members for any hurt, real or perceived, that they may have suffered during their time in our membership, we do not give credence to tales of institutionalised abuse.\"", "description": "Verity and Jonathan grew up in a cult which has faced claims of sexual and physical abuse of children.", "authors": ["Mike Farrell", "Bbc Scotland News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07q05tv.jpg"}
