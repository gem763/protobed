Both Thomas and Joanne are very approachable. I am very shocked but we don\u2019t know the truth of it all yet. I know that Joanne has said that she sold the cab, so who knows?\u201d\n\nThe couple are believed to own at least two businesses in the Warrington area and previously lived in a more modest house about two miles away.\n\nThe route taken by the lorry trailer will be one of the key priorities of the cross-border investigation.\n\nPolice confirmed the trailer was picked up at Purfleet at 12.30am on Wednesday, just over an hour before they were alerted to the discovery of the bodies and attended the scene at an industrial park in Grays.\n\nPlay Video 1:49 Essex police bow heads as lorry containing 39 dead people is moved \u2013 video\n\nThe trailer, which had arrived from Zeebrugge in Belgium, was leased from one Irish company, the Monaghan-based Global Trailer Rental Europe, on 15 October to another business on the Irish border.

Dunkirk is a 40-minute drive from Calais and is a known site for people smugglers preying on migrants seeking to cross the Channel to the UK.\n\nThe data from the tracking device, which has been passed to Essex police investigating the deaths, also shows the trailer made a journey between the UK and mainland Europe on 22 October.\n\nThe Vietnamese embassy in London confirmed it has contacted police in regard to a missing woman feared to be one of the 39 victims.\n\nA spokesman for the embassy said they had been contacted by a family in Vietnam who claimed their daughter had been missing \u201csince the lorry was found\u201d.\n\nThe spokesman said: \u201cWe have contacted Essex police and we are waiting for an answer.\u201d", "description": "Second man from Northern Ireland detained at Stansted airport over 39 deaths", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1596ef6db692e5f77e3fade4e588a7813c3349da/0_543_2768_1660/master/2768.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0e27e43c5f914260e6ce12e97f19b4b", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
