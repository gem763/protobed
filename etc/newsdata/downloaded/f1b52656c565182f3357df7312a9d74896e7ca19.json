The back of the case is engraved with the \u201cOne More Wave\u201d logo to signify the partnership.\n\nThe partnership came to fruition after Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Hotier, president of Ulysse Nardin Americas was introduced to Kyle Buckett, managing director of One More Wave, while visiting the U.S Navy SEALs Training Camp in Coronado, Calif.\n\n\u201cI had an unforgettable first-hand experience watching the veterans in the One More Wave program in action,\u201d Hotier said in a statement. \u201cTheir dedication, courage, and camaraderie is inspiring, and we hope to bring more awareness to this important work.\u201d\n\nThe caseback is engraved with \"One More Wave\" logo. Courtesy of Ulysse Nardin\n\nThe watch has a water resistance up to 1,000 meters, far beyond the 100-meter resistance most watches feature, allowing it to stand up to the highly variable pressures experienced while surfing.\n\nUlysse Nardin, founded in 1846 and a subsidiary of the French luxury conglomerate Kering Group since 2014, has long-standing ties to the sea. The watchmaker became the official supplier to the U.S. Navy after winning a competition to create the most precise marine chronometer in 1905.\n\nOne More Wave was founded in 2015 by members of the U.S. Navy SEALs community. The organization provides custom surfboards for wounded or disabled veterans.", "description": "The 100 limited editions retail for $13,500 apiece", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-116291/social", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
