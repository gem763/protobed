Its brewery in Golden, Colorado, will remain.\n\nMolson Coors says it needs to streamline and bring new products to market more quickly, like the canned wine and hard coffee it introduced this year.\n\nIt's also dropping \"Brewing\" from its name to emphasize that it makes more than beer. It will become Molson Coors Beverage Co. in January.\n\nThe company's beer brands include Miller, Molson, Coors, and Foster's. It also makes Henry's Hard Soda.\n\nMolson Coors' sales fell 3% to $8.1 billion in the first nine months of the year.\n\nThe company's shares slipped 2% to $53.59 in morning trading.", "description": "Molson Coors Brewing Co. is laying off 500 workers worldwide and restructuring its operations as it faces declining beer sales.
