Podocerus jinbe is a tiny crustacean of the sub-order gammaridea. It has a brown-coloured body and reach around five millimetres in length. It captures food using its hairy legs. The new species takes it name after the Japanese for whale shark, whose gills it calls home. Living in the shark's mouth provides fresh water, food and safety.\n\n'This creature \u2014 which is usually 3\u20135 centimetres long \u2014 is amazing, because they can live in so many different kinds of environment,' Professor Tomikawa told the AFP.\n\n'But I didn't expect we would find one inside the mouth of a whale shark.'\n\nThe new species has a brown-coloured body that reaches around five millimetres in length and has hairy legs that help it catch organic substances to eat.\n\nThere are many good reasons why the newly-discovered species might choose such an unexpected environment to call home, Professor Tomikawa explained.\n\n'The mouth of the whale shark is probably a good habitat because fresh seawater, which is necessary for them to breath, comes in regularly.'\n\n'Food flows in too \u2014 and it also provides a safe place without any predators.'\n\n'The mouth of the whale shark is probably a good habitat because fresh seawater, which is necessary for them to breath, comes in regularly,' said Professor Tomikawa. Pictured, a whale shark feeding near the ocean's surface (stock image)\n\nThe tiny crustacean has been named in honour of its whale shark hosts \u2014 which are known as 'jinbe zame' in Japanese.\n\nThe new species was discovered by the staff of an an aquarium in southern Okinawa prefecture, who reached out to Professor Tomikawa for help identifying the creatures they had found living in one of their whale sharks.\n\nAround a thousand Podocerus jinbe were found inside the gills of that shark's mouth, Professor Tomikawa said.", "description": "Lead researcher and biologist\u00a0Ko Tomikawa of Japan's Hiroshima University said that he was 'surprised' to find a species of gammaridea living in another animal's mouth.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/07/wire-20269596-1572247091-673_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
