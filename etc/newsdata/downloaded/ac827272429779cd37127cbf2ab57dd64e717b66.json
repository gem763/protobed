Her son, 30-plus, and his girlfriend live together and have a 1-year-old girl. They've asked to move in with mom and dad \u2014 they have a large home \u2014 to save money to buy a place to live.\n\nMy sister requires them to marry first before moving in with them. Any legal marriage is fine, a religious event is not required.\n\nI would not make that a requirement and it isn't my business. I see this as controlling, boundary-busting and a wrong reason to wed. It's her house, her religion, her prerogative. But not without a price.\n\nCan you help me word the cost of control? This is not a screen to keep out irresponsible adult family members on her part.\n\n\u2014 Concerned\n\n\n\n(Nick Galifianakis for The Washington Post)\n\nConcerned: No, I can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, because you had it right yourself: It isn\u2019t your business.\n\nIf there\u2019s a cost to your sister\u2019s form of control, then she will pay it. She\u2019s an adult.\n\nYour also-adult nephew can choose to meet your sister\u2019s terms or seek other housing.\n\nAnd they can both ask for your help or opinion should they want it.\n\nDear Carolyn: As a citizen of Washington, D.C., I witness a lot of protests just going about my day. I often bristle when I see young children holding signs \u2014 no matter the cause \u2014 alongside their parents.\n\nAs a newish parent (my kids are toddlers), I am less judgmental of parents than I used to be. It's a tough job. But I can't get comfortable with kids too young to have their own thoughts on an issue attending protests and rallies. Am I being too inflexible?\n\n\u2014 Bristling\n\nBristling: Huh. I like seeing kids out there, with caveats \u2014 mostly that the cause at hand is love-based vs. rage-based. Seeing twisted angry young faces is just disturbing.\n\nAnd sometimes, as with climate policy, kids are the biggest stakeholders.\n\nOf course, you also have to keep in mind that indoctrination begins and can occur entirely at home. If in fact parents have boundary problems and think their beliefs also have to be their kids\u2019 beliefs, then they hardly need protests and rallies to exert that kind of influence.\n\nSo the way to give kids room to grow their own beliefs isn\u2019t to skip the rallies; it\u2019s to ask them their opinions on things, encourage them to engage with the world on their own terms and not punish them for independent thinking. That\u2019s how kids find their own voices \u2014 as opposed to adopting the family line under threat of disapproval and estrangement.\n\nFinally, in a country where 40 percent of eligible voters can be counted on to skip even a hotly contested presidential election \u2014 what a consequential embarrassment that is \u2014 and more than that regularly yawn through local contests, maybe parents who encourage their kids to participate in democracy are actually the ones who are getting it right.", "description": "But it is her house, her rules \u2014 and her son\u2019s choice whether to accept them.", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax", "Advice Columnist", "October At Pm", "Carolyn Hax Started Her Advice Column In", "After Five Years As A Copy Editor", "News Editor In Style", "None As A Therapist.
