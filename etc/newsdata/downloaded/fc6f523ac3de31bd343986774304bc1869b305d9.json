The Michigan native reconnected with a longtime friend, Tim Wu (better known as the DJ and record producer Elephante), to create a joint musical project, Diplomacy.\n\nAs Diplomacy, Falahee and Wu released their debut single, \u201cSilver Lake Queen,\u201d this week. The pair sport 1950s rockabilly duds in the accompanying music video, which also features dancer Sadie Yarrington as the mysterious woman referenced in the song\u2019s title.\n\nThough he and Wu have been friends since childhood, Falahee said the idea of collaborating professionally seemed like \u201ca knee-jerk idea\u201d at first. His opinion shifted, however, as the pair began writing music for their first EP, which will combine rock, pop and dance elements and is slated for a 2020 release.\n\nCourtesy of Diplomacy Tim Wu (left), who is best known as the DJ and record producer Elephante, teamed up with actor Jack Falahee to create a joint musical project, Diplomacy.\n\n\u201cA lot of [our writing] deals with looking back at stories that we tell ourselves and our past,\u201d Falahee told Billboard in an interview published Tuesday. \u201cAlso, the uncertainty of our careers and what the future holds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have different stories,\u201d Wu added. \u201cI really like the idea of Diplomacy as almost the art of negotiating or bringing together two sides, whether that be the acting world and the music world.\u201d\n\nThe idea for \u201cSilver Lake Queen\u201d originated with a real-life woman Falahee recently encountered in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cShe had this magnetic, almost otherworldly swagger,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wanted the video to echo that same sort of attitude.\u201d\n\nIn July, ABC announced that the sixth season of \u201cHow to Get Away with Murder\u201d would be the show\u2019s last. Falahee, for his part, has made a distinct effort to branch out into new creative endeavors. He received praise for his role in a Washington, D.C., stage production of Evan Linder\u2019s comedy \u201cByhalia, Mississippi\u201d this summer.\n\nAs for Diplomacy, the duo plan to follow up \u201cSilver Lake Queen\u201d with two additional singles in early 2020. A four-song EP is set to follow in February.", "description": "The actor, beloved as \"HTGAWM's\" Connor Walsh, joined DJ Elephante to form the musical duo Diplomacy.
