By Thursday, the protests had spread to other regions of Iraq.\n\nAuthorities cut internet access in much of Iraq since late Wednesday in a concerted effort to curb the rallies. Social and messaging apps, used to organize the protests, were also blocked. By Thursday afternoon, a curfew was extended to three other southern provinces.\n\nThe unrest is the most serious challenge for Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s year-old government, which also has been caught in the middle of increasing U.S.-Iran tensions in the region. Iraq is allied with both countries and hosts thousands of U.S. troops, as well as powerful paramilitary forces allied with Iran.\n\nSome Baghdad demonstrators blamed Iranian-backed groups within the security forces for the violence. Media affiliated with the Iranian-backed groups have pointed fingers at the United States and Saudi Arabia for the unrest.\n\nBRITAIN, FRANCE, GERMANY BLAME IRAN FOR ATTACKS ON KEY OIL FACILITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA\n\nIn the last three days, at least 20 protesters and one policeman were killed in four provinces. On Thursday, the first death was reported in Baghdad where one protester was killed as the demonstrators pushed their way toward Tahrir Square in the city center. The square has been off-limits since Wednesday night just before the curfew.\n\nAt least three protesters were shot and killed Thursday in Zaafaraniya, a southern Baghdad neighborhood, according to police and a medical official.\n\nExplosions were heard before dawn inside Baghdad\u2019s heavily fortified Green Zone, home to government offices and foreign embassies.\n\nIn the latest deaths, at least six protesters were shot and killed Thursday in the city of Nasiriyah, about 200 miles south of Baghdad, a medical official told The Associated Press. Nasiriyah has seen the most violence since the protests began on Tuesday.\n\nThe mostly leaderless protests have been concentrated in Baghdad and in predominantly Shiite areas of southern Iraq, bringing out jobless youths and university graduates who are suffering under an economy reeling from graft and mismanagement.\n\nTwo demonstrators were killed Tuesday and at least 17 deaths were reported Wednesday, including a policeman, in rallies in Nasiriyah, Kut, and Amara, according to security officials.\n\nBaghdad\u2019s main streets were largely deserted Thursday morning, except for Iraqi army vehicles. Some sideroads were blocked with barbed wire.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen the demonstrators tried to reach a nearby bridge leading to the Green Zone, Iraqi security forces started shooting automatic rifles above the crowd. They also fired tear gas, according to an AP cameraman.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "At least 31 people in Iraq have been killed and hundreds more wounded after three days of clashing between anti-government demonstrators and Iraqi security forces.", "authors": ["Bradford Betz", "Bradford Betz Is An Editor For Fox News.
