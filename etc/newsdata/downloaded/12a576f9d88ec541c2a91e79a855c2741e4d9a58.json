She strived to prove what was written actually works and went through a trial-and-error process. I was impressed,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the characters of Haga\u2019s essay revealed themselves in the heat, Yamada \u2014 who had promised his students extra marks for creativity \u2014 decided to award her an A.\n\nHaga, 19, made the ink by soaking soybeans overnight and then squeezing them into a paste.\n\nShe told AFP she had tested three different kinds of paper for the optimum effect.\n\n\u201cIf the paper is too thin, it burns when heated. If it\u2019s too thick, it doesn\u2019t absorb the ink very well,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI usually use pens and PC to write things. It\u2019s been a while since I took a brush to write with an invisible ink,\u201d she said.\n\nYamada said reports filed as scrolls or folded into throwing stars were the most creative his students had been up until now.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the use of invisible ink, but I was amazed that someone actually used it,\u201d he said, adding that he didn\u2019t read the entire paper because he wanted to keep some of Haga\u2019s work invisible.\n\n\u201cBy learning about ninja\u2026 we can apply their knowledge and ways to modern society.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "A Japanese student aced an assignment on ninja culture by making her own invisible ink from soybeans in a stealthy move that impressed her professor.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/invisible-ink.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
