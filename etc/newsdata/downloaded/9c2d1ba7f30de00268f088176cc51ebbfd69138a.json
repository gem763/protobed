But the decision was appealed by 3iQ, which focuses on disruptive technology and digital assets and has so far concentrated on sophisticated investors in the exempt market.\n\nThe investment fund manager argued that the custody, audit, and pricing of its fund and the bitcoin it purchases would be secure and compliant with existing regulations. Gemini Trust Company LLC, the regulated digital currency exchange and custodian founded by early bitcoin owners Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, will act as custodian of the fund\u2019s bitcoin.\n\nIn a statement this summer, Pye said his fund would be disciplined, and would stand in contrast to \u201cevents\u201d in the cryto space such as global hacking incidents, and the bankruptcy of crypto exchange QuadringaCX following the death of its co-founder Gerald Cotten.\n\nDuring hearings in front of an OSC panel in June and July, staff of the regulator argued that the OSC\u2019s initial rejection should remain in place, and noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had rejected a rule change that would have allowed for the listing and trading of bitcoin-based ETFs.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the OSC panel chaired by commissioner Lawrence P. Haber ruled that the cases were different, and that the Canadian regulator\u2019s staff had not demonstrated that bitcoin was an illiquid asset that would render it non-compliant with existing regulations. Nor had OSC staff proved that it would not be in the public interest to allow the fund to issue a prospectus due to concerns \u201cregarding the integrity of the bitcoin markets\u201d and the fund\u2019s ability to safeguard the bitcoin its holds, Haber ruled.\n\nThe panel rejected placing conditions on the bitcoin fund, such as restricting the entities with whom the fund could purchase and sell bitcoin, and addressing insurance requirements for the fund\u2019s bitcoin held in wallets. Haber concluded that 3iQ had taken \u201creasonable steps to mitigate the risks associated with the Fund and the bitcoin markets through the structure of the Fund and the use of professional and qualified third-party service providers.\u201d\n\nThe net asset value of Bitcoin Fund\u2019s units would be published daily, and would reflect the changing value of the bitcoin held by the fund, said Pye, who previously worked as senior vice-president and national sales manager at Fidelity Investments Canada and at Guardian Trust Co., which listed the first gold, silver and platinum certificates on the Montreal Exchange.\n\nRetail investors would be able to buy and sell the bitcoin fund through traditional and discount brokers, and the investments would be eligible for RRSPs and tax-free savings accounts, he said.\n\n\u2022 Email: bshecter@nationalpost.com | Twitter: BatPost", "description": "At first Ontario\u2019s market watchdog rejected the idea", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/bitcoin-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
