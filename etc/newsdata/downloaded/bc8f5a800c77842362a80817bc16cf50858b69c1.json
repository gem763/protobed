I am blessed. I can do anything,' while walking along the sidewalk, evidently ready to take on the world.\n\nThe New York City-based mom revealed she taught Ayaan the affirmations a year earlier, on his second birthday, but she was still audibly shocked as she heard him say the words out loud.\n\nUplifting: A heartwarming video showed a three-year-old boy reciting positive affirmations as he walked to school with his mom\n\nSurprise! Ayaan's mom Alissa had taught him the phrases a year previously, but his sudden outburst caught her by surprise\n\n'I taught Ayaan this positive affirmation... in hopes that he would one day memorize it, understand it and use it as a motivational tool whenever he needed it,' Alissa said on Instagram while sharing the heartwarming video.\n\n'Well he shocked me this morning. Out of nowhere he started repeating it, so I pulled out my phone. He ended (with enthusiasm) once we made it to our destination,' she added.\n\nThe mom-of-one said she is 'so proud of the little boy he is growing into.'\n\nProud mom: Alissa, a NYC-based stylist pictured with Ayaan left and right, said she was 'so proud' of the little boy her son was becoming\n\nCutie!
