But US troops remained in Syria on Wednesday despite Mr Trump's statement that they'd been withdrawn, according to a US official who was not authorised to speak publicly. The military continues to close outposts in Syria housing US commandos, the official said. The military has concerns for their safety because militias supported by Turkey are viewed as a potential threat in Syria to American troops, who are being evacuated by aircraft and convoys.\n\nMr Trump's remarks on Syria drew renewed ire from Senator Lindsey Graham, who has been a stanch Trump ally on many issues but critical of the president's Middle East policy.\n\n\"I hope President Trump is right in his belief that Turkeys invasion of Syria is of no concern to us, abandoning the Kurds won't come back to haunt us, ISIS won't reemerge, and Iran will not fill the vacuum created by this decision,\" Senator Graham tweeted.\n\n\"However, I firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President Obama's decision to leave Iraq,\" he added.\n\nMr Trump announced additional sanctions on Turkey on Monday, though critics have said those are less significant than the economic punishments lawmakers are considering. The House is set to vote Wednesday on a bipartisan resolution condemning Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria.\n\nMr Pence and Mr Pompeo are set to travel to Turkey late Wednesday to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to try to negotiate a ceasefire. Mr Erdogan initially indicated he wouldn't meet with the US delegation but now has expressed a willingness to do so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts have said the US presence in northern Syria had stabilised the area, and made military conflict more likely; the post-withdrawal influx of Turkish and Russian troops makes it more dangerous.\n\nMark Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, described the president's remarks as \"yet another ignominious moment in Trump's treatment of American allies.\"\n\nBut, Mr Dubowitz said, this one is \"particularly egregious given that the Kurds lost 11,000 men and women fighting ISIS and helping save American lives.\"\n\nAnti-Trump Republican strategist Rick Tyler agreed. \"Well, I hope they weren't angels, they were killing our enemies,\" Mr Tyler said. \"Trump has shown the world that he is a weak, easily manipulated, corrupt and disloyal. We will pay in treasure and blood tomorrow for his misguided ill-informed decisions today.\"\n\nMCT", "description": "The US president claims he was \"strategically brilliant\" to pull troops out of Syria, a move that paved the way for an eruption of violence by Turkish forces against Kurds who fought alongside American troops.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1964%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/08a3676cb376cc0871b76b8dbb3d9364dfdecd69", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
