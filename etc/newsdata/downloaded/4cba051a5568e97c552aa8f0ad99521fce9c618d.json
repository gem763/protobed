They differ subtly, but all have their place, and are all managed from the same screen.\n\nYou control the three quiet modes from your watch\u2019s Control Center, which you access by swiping up from the bottom of any screen. If you don\u2019t see the specific icon you want, either flick the screen up and down with your finger or rotate the watch\u2019s crown.\n\n\u201cSilent mode\u201d means your watch will not chime or beep but will vibrate. All other functions work normally. Turn it on and off by tapping the bell icon.\n\n\u201cTheater mode\u201d puts your phone into silent mode and also turns off the display, unless you tap it or press a button. Your watch won\u2019t ping or light up, but it will vibrate. Turn this mode on and off by tapping the comedy / tragedy icon.\n\n\u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d turns off the haptics, too. You won\u2019t get notified at all \u2014 with the important exceptions of alarms and heart rate alerts \u2014 and your screen won\u2019t light up when notifications arrive. Turn it on and off by tapping the crescent moon icon.\n\nGrid View Silent mode\n\nTheater mode\n\nDo Not Disturb mode\n\nChose how long you want DND mode to last\n\nIt\u2019s possible to set up your devices so that turning on Do Not Disturb on your watch will also activate it on your phone (and vice versa).\n\nOpen the Watch app on your iPhone and scroll down to General.\n\nTap the \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d menu item.\n\nToggle \u201cMirror iPhone\u201d to on. This means Do Not Disturb will enable or disable simultaneously on both your iPhone and your watch (and you can control the setting from either device).\n\nWhen you pick Do Not Disturb mode, you can choose how long you want it to last: until you cancel, for just an hour, until the evening, or until you leave your current location. If you have an event currently occurring in your calendar, then you can also set Do Not Disturb to last until the end of the event.", "description": "If you want to keep your Apple Watch from disturbing you with alarms, notifications, or any other sounds, you have no fewer than three different ways to keep it quiet: silent mode, theater mode, and Do Not Disturb.", "authors": ["Dan Rosenbaum", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8BTC41h51jOLhqKUYiCnXCjNYM=/0x180:2500x1489/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4294209/stock-apple-watch-time-0162.0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
