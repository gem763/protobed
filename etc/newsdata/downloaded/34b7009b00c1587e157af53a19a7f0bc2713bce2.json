Thank you Bob Scott for making me think outside the (toy)box.\"\n\nThis doll-inspired makeup tutorial opens up with a barefaced Kloss sitting alongside makeup artist Bob Scott. They both discuss the importance of prepping the skin and Kloss cleanses her skin with a makeup wipe and follows with a nourishing serum from Estee Lauder.\n\nNext, Scott uses Elmer's glue stick to glide over and slick down Kloss' brows. \"Yes, with the grain and then against the grain and then back with the grain,\" Scott advises.\n\nAfter setting the brows, the rest of the steps are shown and we literally see Kloss morph into someone else.\n\nToward the end of the video, Scott pops on a blonde wig with heavy layered bangs and two pigtails to bring the look completely together.\n\nPress play on the video above to see it all go down in reel time for yourself. Will you be trying it out this Halloween?", "description": "Model Karlie Kloss transforms into a Bratz doll for Halloween in her latest makeup tutorial.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/karlie-kloss-bratz-ht-jt-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
