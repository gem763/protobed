It\u2019s been a great week for me, I\u2019ve really enjoyed my time on court here.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m just in a really good place and I think that\u2019s showing in my results. Even though I haven\u2019t won as many matches at WTA level this year, I\u2019ve still won a lot of matches in the back end of the year. Yeah, I hope it continues. I\u2019m feeling really positive for next year.\u2019\n\nWith Australian Open qualification in the bag, Watson will take a period of rest before heading to Florida for an intense pre-season training camp, convinced she has the right formula to make a fast start to next season.\n\nShe added: \u2018Last year I was sort of chasing points to make main draw Australia and ended up not really doing myself any favours because I didn\u2019t have a proper preparation for Australia last year so now I\u2019m done, I\u2019m going to have a proper off-season and then pre-season and yeah just really excited and motivated for 2020, mostly because of the Olympics because I really want to be involved in that again as I\u2019ve been involved in London and Rio.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s a big goal of mine, that\u2019s what I\u2019m really focusing on at the moment.\u2019\n\nHeather Watson results in Tianjin R1: 6-4 7-6 Bondarenko\n\nR2: 6-3 6-0 Wang\n\nQF: 7-5 6-7 7-6 Linette\n\nSF: 6-1 6-4 Kudermetova\n\nF: 4-6 4-6 Peterson\n\nTo qualify for singles, where she has lost in the second round in both Rio and London, she will need to improve her ranking \u2013 which will sit at world No. 88 next week \u2013 by just over 30 places to guarantee her spot. She could also realistically qualify for both women\u2019s and mixed doubles.\n\nIf she maintains the form shown in Tianjin this week, she can easily boost her ranking, particularly given the distinct lack of points she has to defend before May. Her partnership with coach Rob Morgan \u2013 who she teamed up with at the start of the American hard court summer \u2013 seems to be in a good place.\n\nShe failed to add another 100 points to her tally by suffering defeat to Peterson and suggested a change in conditions may have harmed her chances.\n\nIn a rain-hit day in the north-eastern Chinese city, Watson the match was delayed by more than five hours before being forced indoors with a limited number of spectators \u2013 hardly a setting fit for a tournament final.\n\n\u2018That [the delay] wasn\u2019t the part that wasn\u2019t great for me, I didn\u2019t mind that actually,\u2019 Watson continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I just felt for me personally I didn\u2019t play well on the indoor court at all. It\u2019s like the slowest court I\u2019ve ever played on.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s obviously the same for both players. It\u2019s not an excuse, I just didn\u2019t play as well as I had been. It was a shame for the tournament it had to be moved indoors.\u2019\n\nRebecca Peterson with her title (Picture: STR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWatson made 38 unforced errors in the match compared to 21 winners in the hour and 37 minutes long contest, and Peterson was the more steady of the two.\n\nThe Britisn No. 2 made strong starts in both sets, securing an early lead but her opponent hit back and was by and large the dominant force, with Watson setting up just one further break point chance outside of the two games in which she broke.\n\nThat said, most games were tight and it was an enouraging performance against a player who has been in good recent form.\n\nPeterson, who will climb to a career-high world No. 44 when the WTA rankings are next released on Monday, has won two titles during her stay in China and counts Venus Williams among her recent victims.\n\nIn the trophy ceremony \u2013 a small affair which boasted a giant yellow bird holding a tennis racquet \u2013 Peterson said: \u2018Congratulations to Heather on a great week. You\u2019re playing great so just keep going. I had some great weeks here in China so trust me, I\u2019ll be back.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has also recorded a win over the likes of former US Open champion Sloane Stephens and Watson\u2019s compatriot Johanna Konta during the 2019 season.\n\nMORE: Cori \u201cCoco\u201d Gauff, 15, wins first WTA title as stunning breakthrough season rolls on\n\nMORE: Daniil Medvedev secures Shanghai Masters title as ruthless streak continues", "description": "Heather Watson ended her season in defeat at the Tianjin Open but is now targeting a spot at the Tokyo Olympic Games next summer.", "authors": ["George Bellshaw"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-11692512921_1570981680.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
