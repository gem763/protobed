It confirmed iSignthis' own interest in ASX-listed Etherstack is held by a British Virgin Islands entity, iSignthis BVI.\n\nIn 2018 iSignthis loaned Etherstack $1 million. Friday's reply also confirms that 410,000 Etherstack shares are held by iSignthis BVI.\n\nThe fintech unicorn's stock last traded at $1.07, up from 15\u00a2 at the start of the year. Earlier this week it emerged that the exchange was also looking into whether iSignthis's free-float was correctly calculated after the company admitted that Red 5 Solutions, a BVI-based entity that holds more than 10 per cent of the register, is part-owned by chief executive John Karantzis' brother Andrew.\n\niSignthis was added to the S &P/ASX 300 Index in September.", "description": "Suspended payments company iSignthis has responded to the stock exchange's queries about its business amid an examination by the market's twin regulators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6637%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_104%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/78f8715d138badeedaad57ab640a475ee415602b", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
