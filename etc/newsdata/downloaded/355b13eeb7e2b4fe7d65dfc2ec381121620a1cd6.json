They said the agreement was lopsided, forcing the once U.S.-allied Kurds out of their homes, while allowing Turkey to occupy new territory and avoid U.S. sanctions.\n\nHurd conceded that the power that he and other concerned lawmakers have to force Mr. Trump to reverse course is limited. But he said continued public pressure \u2014 especially regarding a potential resurgence of ISIS because of the American and Kurdish retreat \u2014 might encourage the White House to address concerns raised by most congressional Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\"It's always easier to compel an administration to stop doing something than it is to begin something,\" Hurd said.\n\n\"I think what we could be doing now is bringing in some of the heads of the military, the heads of the intelligence service, the heads of our humanitarian organizations to talk about what are we going to do to prevent ISIS from becoming resurgent,\" he added.", "description": "The Turkish government on Thursday promised the U.S. that it would allow once American-allied Kurdish fighters to retreat out areas of northern Syria", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/20/5483e4b6-5a18-4fd4-b4df-6793065a1faf/thumbnail/1200x630/96f1df533d92db0193793f0f801e10b5/hurd2.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
