Steady building of form, confidence\n\nBeaten right up front in the much-touted opener against the All Blacks despite good opportunities to have won it, the Boks put the result behind them quickly enough to breeze through the remaining games against Namibia (57-3), Italy (49-3) and Canada (66-7).\n\nIn doing so, they exhibited plenty of polish, passion and intent along the way, while always leaving the impression - not the worst thing, entering knockout play where you need a step-up anyway? - that perfection was still elusive.\n\nBut that trio of matches did allow them to fine-tune a few aspects of their play, try out some new tactics at times and, just as importantly, give virtually everyone in the squad a sense of form and mental sharpness and a healthy \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together\u201d ethic.\n\n2. Rosy depth \u2026 especially in the pack\n\nCoach Rassie Erasmus\u2019s \u201cdirt-trackers\u201d came strongly to the selection forefront - as had always been his stated plan - in the victories over Namibia and Canada.\n\nSimultaneously, they largely confirmed that the Boks have most bases extremely soundly covered in the event of injury or other disruption to mainline plans.\n\nIt was especially apparent in the near-embarrassment of riches South Africa have in forward resources: probably their best overall collection of engine-roomers in all seven RWCs they\u2019ve taken part in.\n\nTaking no chances about the possibility of a competitive forward battle against Italy (something that only became a damp squib from the outgunned Azzurri, really), Erasmus went for a 6-2 split in favour of pack men on that occasion: it simply illustrated even better that there is just no SA let-up in excellence when you unleash, for instance, a Marx for an Mbonambi, a Kitshoff for a Mtawarira, a Snyman for an Etzebeth \u2026 the list goes just on.\n\n3. Strong statistics\n\nThe Boks amassed 185 points in pool play and only conceded 36: so the differential is \u201cplus-149\u201d \u2026 14 better than arch-rivals NZ as things stand, although the All Blacks will be heavily tipped to nip back to supremacy in their closing match against the Italians.\n\nSimilarly, the current, tournament-topping Bok try ratio of 27 for and three against, overshadows the NZ figure of 22-1 though, again, the cup-holders should perk up their figure substantially against the limited Azzurri.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s victory over Canada was their biggest yet from three bilateral encounters, and the result against Italy achieved by the widest margin against that nation in 10 tussles since an identical 46-point margin in Port Elizabeth in 2001.\n\n4. Sound conditioning, low injury toll\n\nWhile some concerns are being expressed, for example, about the various Six Nations teams\u2019 ability to adapt to the unusual levels of humidity in Japan so far, there have generally been no such problems for the Boks.\n\nEarly arrivals in the country, and then with the advantage of playing the host nation themselves in the immediate lead-up, Erasmus\u2019s charges have looked increasingly comfortable in the sticky conditions and their handling improving to the same degree.\n\nThe Boks are also in a healthy space when it comes to injuries: the relative lack of them.\n\nWhile it was unfortunate to lose two influential squad members in the in-form tighthead prop Trevor Nyakane and midfielder Jesse Kriel (leaving the Boks low on specialist outside centres) during the pool stage, there was good immediate cover, and both Thomas du Toit and Damian Willemse were popular emergency additions.\n\n5. The Cheslin factor\n\nWhile he picked up an ankle problem late in the Italian clash, right wing dynamo Cheslin Kolbe - quite unquestionably one of the players of the World Cup to this point - seems raring to go for the knockouts.\n\nAnd thank goodness for that: his amazing levels of skill and enterprise to go with that massive \u201cticker\u201d in a modest frame have lit up the event and clearly rubbed off favourably on many team-mates.\n\nWhile last year had seen him deliver some signals of what lay ahead from him at the game\u2019s loftiest level, the Kraaifontein-born, twinkle-toed competitor has hugely wowed in virtually all of his five Bok starts in 2019 (five tries along the way) \u2026 and very much including the World Cup clashes with NZ and Italy.\n\nKolbe makes things happen from the seemingly most innocuous of situations, and from virtually anywhere on the park, too: he will be a key weapon in the knockouts amidst a broader Bok backline still containing a few deficiencies elsewhere.\n\nTHREE NEGATIVES\n\n1. Probably still the trickier quarter-final route\n\nAs things stood, Ireland (just with Samoa left to play) remained likeliest, by my book, in Pool A to top the incredibly tense group \u2026 despite the stirring showing of Japan, facing a titanic \u201celiminator\u201d against Scotland in Yokohama on Sunday.\n\nThat would mean the Boks being punished, if that is the right expression, for their almost certain second-place finish in Pool B by facing the Irish in a quarter-final.\n\nIt could very feasibly still be Japan instead, of course, if they knock over the Scots to unexpectedly claim first place, though the last-named side are building a timely head of steam, and not yet lost in seven prior encounters with the Brave Blossoms.\n\nI am not remotely seduced by the talk that \u201cperhaps Ireland would be better now anyway\u201d for the Boks. To a man, I am sure they\u2019d still prefer to tackle the Japanese. Yes, passionate home advantage, eye-catching team spirit and all \u2026\n\n2. Attack limitations from set play\n\nMuch about the Boks has been effervescent and constructive, even while their tried and trusted habits - like a strong set-piece, polished rolling maul and natural relish for the collisional aspects \u2013 have powered them pleasingly as well.\n\nThey are also striking to lethal effect at times in broken play or from long range, aided by the pace and guile of the likes of Kolbe and prolific-scoring Makazole Mapimpi.\n\nBut if there is one major question mark still over these Boks, it is the over-reliance at times on box kicking off nine, and a lingering lack of fluidity or conviction in backline attack off structured play.\n\nThe Boks have irksomely butchered several clear-cut try-scoring opportunities at this tournament, even when overlaps of the three-on-one kind have presented themselves.\n\nCould that come home to roost somehow in a ding-dong, KO clash?\n\n3. The Etzebeth controversy\n\nThis bubbles and bubbles \u2026 an obvious distraction (even if they might try to spin a denying view) that they simply don\u2019t need while so much else is going quite swimmingly.\n\nThe events of that rowdy night in Langebaan, including alleged racial slurs by the big lock meanie and his mates, have turned into a political hot potato back home, with widespread calls for Etzebeth\u2019s summoning home from the tournament \u2026 even as an also well-stocked lobby reminds of the \u201cinnocent until proved guilty\u201d principle.\n\nFrom one day to another, the Boks can\u2019t be truly sure that their second most experienced squad member (and a sometimes captain) behind Tendai Mtawarira in caps terms will remain part of their ranks in Japan.\n\nStill, the instability on that front is offset to some degree by just how rousingly the likely next in line to the first-team No 4 shirt, RG Snyman, has been performing.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "<strong>Rob Houwing</strong> weighs up the just-completed Springbok Pool B campaign at the World Cup and where it leaves them for the business end \u2026", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9438/9fa0d70f7f4c48d39cd068612f81d03c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
