I think a lot of things need to improve.\n\n\u201cProbably the worst time, most difficult time, since I've been here. I don't know. I don't know what is happening. Come on, we cannot score even one goal in two games. Sorry to the fans.\u201d\n\nAcademy graduate Marcus Rashford has also called on United to raise their game.\n\nHe posted on Twitter: \"You can't hide in football and the last few weeks simply haven't been good enough.\n\n\"As a United fan myself, that hurts. And you deserve better. We know we need to improve and that is our sole focus as a team and as a club.\"\n\nBrazilian midfielder Fred, meanwhile, has said that criticism, including that from United legend, has to be accepted and used as motivation.\n\nHe told Esporte Interativo: \u201cThey are within their rights, they\u2019ve won many titles with this club. We have to shut up and work on the pitch.\n\n\u201cSome critics are pointless, but many can offer me lessons.\u201d", "description": "The Red Devils star admits serious improvement is required at Old Trafford after a disappointing start to the season for OIe Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/N4dNaPNZLV7.oM6_K3iFhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zwTHdb.kw6GSQjbvVDncEw--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/uk.goal.com/c4c93aa1b7dadc6c02c62b5d213c6835", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
