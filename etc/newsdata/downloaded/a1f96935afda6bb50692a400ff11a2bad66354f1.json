In conjunction with Chestermere Minor Hockey, the two organizations have created one of the most active Mini Blades activations this season.\n\nThree-time Olympic champion Scott Moir has been feeling that sport for youth is altogether too serious today. \"It [the Mini Blades] is taking us back to playing sport, and that is why I am behind this project so much,\" explained Moir.\n\nFor their part, the Chestermere skaters from both sports have embraced the challenge of the Mini Blades movement, coming up with seven teams:\n\nGrace Doren, 11 (figure skater) and Grayson VanTol, 11 (hockey player) \u2013 These two rink lovers are dedicated to their respective sports on the ice, while Grace enjoys paddleboarding on Lake Chestermere and Grayson loves spending time with his dogs away from the rink.\n\nHarlowe Bren, 11 (figure skater) and Fraser Doren, 13 (hockey player) \u2013 Aside from \"rink games,\" Harlowe can be found with friends at home outside on her trampoline while Fraser is inside challenging himself on his Xbox.\n\nAndie Williscroft, 9 (figure skater) and Jaden Gill, 10 (hockey player) \u2013 The first of two members of the Williscroft family involved in the Mini Blades, Andie loves editing videos and creating dances. Both skaters are committed to their ice sport.\n\nGreta Williscroft, 7 (figure skater) and Beckham VanTol, 9 (hockey player) \u2013 Beckham, a huge sports enthusiast can often be found hanging out with friends. Greta loves to spend time with big sister Andie paddle boarding and kayaking in the summers.\n\nTenley Bren, 7 (figure skater) and Aryan Virk, 9 (hockey player) \u2013 Tenley has already been skating for five years and loves to play Minecraft away from the rink. Aryan, nicknamed \"The Tank\" for his strength and size by his hockey teammates, is as accomplished off the ice as a member of the Calgary Yacht Club's Youth Race Team.\n\nCarmela Albornoz, 14 (figure skater) and Ryder Couture, 13 (hockey player) \u2013 Both skaters have a clear love of their sports on the ice. Away from the rink, entrepreneur Ryder, an animal lover, and his brother Caine have a flock of 56 chickens that they tend and from which they sell eggs in addition to a sibling-run cotton candy business.\n\nZoe Melanson, 12 (figure skater) and AJ Gunn, 12 (hockey player) \u2013 Both of these athletes have a bigger focus than just being active in their respective sports. AJ delivers the local paper to help pay for his hockey. Animal-loving Zoe's big heart has led her to helping local non-profit organizations to raise money like The Children's Hospital and creating and organizing a food drive for the Chestermere Food Bank.", "description": "Chestermere, Alberta's Ice Edge Skating Club joined forces with Minor Hockey, pairing up Mini Blades!", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5312599.1570485186!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/carmela-albornoz-age-14-ryder-couture-age-13.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
