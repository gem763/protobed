a ban still in effect today.\n\nAccording to the report, the FAA had been made aware of MCAS, though \u2018the information and discussions about MCAS were so fragmented and were delivered to disconnected groups\u2019 that it \u2018was difficult to recognize the impacts and implications of this system.\u2019\n\nInvestigators say had the FAA fully understood the details of MCAS, the federal agency would\u2019ve further scrutinized the system, which would\u2019ve likely identified its flaws.\n\nSince the MAX's worldwide grounding in March, Boeing has been working on updating the MCAS system to make it less powerful, and will install the modified version of the software upon the plane's relaunch.\n\nThe FAA\u2019s administrator, Steve Dickson, said in a statement that he would \u2018review every recommendation and take appropriate action.\n\n\u2018We welcome this scrutiny and are confident that our openness to these efforts will further bolster aviation safety worldwide,\u2019 Dickson continued.\n\nBoeing has not yet responded to a DailyMail.com request for comment.\n\nWhile the report\u2019s scope is described as \u2018narrow\u2019, the task force was able to review the certification of the 737 MAX's automated system, known as MCAS, which had a key role in the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines flights in October 2018 and March this year, respectively\n\nIn both of the crashes, a single damaged senor plunged the plane into a irremediable nose dive just minutes after take-off, leaving pilots with no chance of correcting the 737 MAX's path (pictued: aftermath of the Ethiopian Air crash in March, 2019)\n\nOne of the report\u2019s main themes is said to highlight the FAA\u2019s over fixation on the specifics of the new system, rather than investigating and understanding its overall impact on the plane.\n\nDuring the certification process of the MAX, MCAS was not evaluated as a \u2018complete and integrated function\u2019 of the aircraft.\n\nInvestigators say Boeing also failed to report alterations and updates to the MCAS system during the plane\u2019s development stages.\n\nAn investigation conducted by the New York Times found that such tweaks made MCAS more influential and more temperamental, with key FAA officials unaware of the changes.\n\nThe manufacturer is also accused of failing to thoroughly stress-test MCAS\u2019 design, where \u2018design assumptions were not adequately reviewed, updated or validated\u2019, as well as failing to consider the extra effort pilots needed to go through to handle MCAS, including \u2018pilot recognition time and pilot reaction time to failures.\u2019\n\nThe report found that Boeing removed mention of MCAS from a draft of its pilot manual, meaning some FAA officials were not entirely aware of MCAS and were \u2018not in a position to adequately assess training needs.\u2019\n\nInvestigators say had the FAA fully understood the details of MCAS, the federal agency would\u2019ve further scrutinized the system, which would\u2019ve likely identified its flaws. Since the MAX's worldwide grounding in March, Boeing has been working on updating the MCAS system to make it less powerful, and will install the modified version of the software upon the MAX's relaunch\n\nAs a reform, the report suggest the FAA update its certification process to allow the agency to be more involved in the design process of new planes earlier on.\n\nThe FAA certified the MAX in 2017. According to the report, the newest addition to the 737 lineage was allowed to undergo a less thorough examination than other new planes, because of its familiarity with the 737 design.\n\n\u2018Some elements of the design and certification remain rooted in the original 1967 certification of the B737-100,\u2019 investigators noted. However while some modern safety tools were incorporated into the MAX's design, some were left out after Boeing deemed them \u2018impractical\u2019.\n\nIn conclusion, the report found issue with the process for certifying a new plane based on a previous design, as it \u2018lacks an adequate assessment of how proposed design changes integrate with existing systems,\u2019 the Times reported.\n\nInvestigators recommended the FAA confirm the MAX's compliance with regulations regarding the plane\u2019s flight guidance system, flight manual and stall demonstration.\n\nIt\u2019s claimed the FAA has already taken steps to address these recommendations, which in large has contributed to the prolonged grounding of the MAX, which is now expected to return early 2020.", "description": "The report, conducted by a multi-agency task force of experts convened by the FAA, says Boeing failed to adequately explain to regulators its new control system prior to its launch in 2017.", "authors": ["Luke Kenton For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/14/19588858-0-image-a-11_1570801383417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
