Brunson was sentenced to prison time but restrictions on his travel have been lifted.\n\nCatch up quick: Brunson has been held since 2016 on terrorism charges the U.S. says are baseless. Trump fumed publicly and slapped sanctions on Turkey after the pastor was moved to house arrest in August, rather than released as the U.S. expected. Erdogan seemed shocked by the response and refused to back down.", "description": "Andrew Brunson will be allowed to travel to the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/V61G6oMBJRPpbzjnRM8qEJ5Tm5k=/0x249:2835x1844/1920x1080/2018/10/11/1539299365157.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-12"}
