It seems selfish, rude and a little self indulgent. I spent years talking about the importance of self care in eating disorder recovery as a way to heal our body image, but if I\u2019m being honest, I wasn\u2019t always practicing what I preach.\n\nALSO SEE: 'It was time to stop hiding': How shaving her head helped this blogger embrace her 'inner warrior'\n\nSure, I\u2019d sometimes take a bubble bath and slap on a face mask and if that\u2019s your thing, great! But if we look at the definition of self care, there is so much more to it.\n\nSo, what is self care and what are some ways you can foster a more positive body image and improve your mental and physical health?\n\nRini Frey.

More\n\nLet\u2019s look at the official definition of self care: Self care is care provided \u201cfor you, by you.\u201d It's about identifying your own needs and taking steps to meet them. It\u2019s about taking the time to engage in activities that nurture you, taking proper care of yourself and treating yourself as kindly as you treat others.\n\nI like to think of self care in three layers:\n\nLayer one: basic self care\n\nThis layer is about meeting your most fundamental needs, such as dressing and undressing yourself, feeding yourself, using the bathroom and washing and grooming yourself. We are privileged if we are able to practice basic self care and sometimes, this alone helps with stress management and a more peaceful life.\n\nALSO SEE: 'I'm all about sharing the good, the bald and the ugly': Blogger reveals her private struggle with hair loss\n\nLayer two: physical self care\n\nThe second layer is basically the \u201cupgraded\u201d version of basic self care. It includes any additional habits or actions that take care of your physical needs. Aside from what I mentioned in the basic self care-layer, these include getting enough sleep, moving your body in ways you enjoy and are able to, resting your body when needed, getting a massage or stretching your body to release muscle tension.\n\nLayer three: mental and emotional self care:\n\nThis final layer is about engaging in thoughts and activities that nurture your mental health and your overall outlook on life. The goal of this self care layer is to make you feel like your life is meaningful, that you belong and that you are enough.\n\nIt\u2019s the layer that helps you heal your body image and foster more self esteem, which in turn positively effects your relationships as well as decrease your stress levels big time. I would argue that this is the most neglected layer of self care. Most of us rush through our day, frantically checking things off our do-to list, coming home at night feeling like we have nothing left to give to ourselves.\n\nWe fail to ask for help, because we\u2019re either ashamed to admit we need it, or we don\u2019t want to be a burden on other people. I can very much empathize with that, because I\u2019ve been there plenty of times: burnt out, anxious, unable to sleep or shut my brain off at night.\n\nALSO SEE: 'I was never taught to love my fatness': What Generation Z is teaching older men about body positivity\n\nIf you can relate, I want you to consider just how much your mental and emotional well-being affect your life and the life of your loved ones.
