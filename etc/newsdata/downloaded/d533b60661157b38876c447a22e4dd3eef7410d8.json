All they\u2019ve done since is back up their words with wins.\n\nTeddy Bridgewater threw for 281 yards and two touchdowns, and the Saints improved to 5-0 without their injured star quarterback by beating the Chicago Bears 36-25 on Sunday.\n\nThe Saints (6-1) again showed why they still see themselves as Super Bowl contenders even though their star quarterback is out indefinitely because of a torn ligament in his right thumb.\n\nBridgewater completed 23 of 38 passes, Michael Thomas had nine receptions for 131 yards, and Latavius Murray ran for 119 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI think Teddy\u2019s just playing the way he knows how to play,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s trying to replace Drew. He\u2019s just come in and been himself. That\u2019s all you can ask because Teddy\u2019s had success before. This is nothing new to him. He\u2019s been a successful quarterback at this level. He\u2019s done a heck of a job, obviously, and he\u2019s been undefeated.\u201d\n\nBesides Brees, New Orleans had to get by without top running back Alvin Kamara (ankle, knee) and top receiving tight end Jared Cook (ankle). Both players were ruled out Friday, but that didn\u2019t stop the NFC South leaders from taking down the Monsters of the Midway.\n\n\u201cYou look at us overall \u2014 offensively, defensively, the kicking game \u2014 we\u2019re playing elite football right now,\u201d Bridgewater said. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not as pretty as we\u2019d like it to be. But it\u2019s working for us.\u201d\n\nSTRUGGLING BEARS\n\nThe Bears (3-3) lost their second straight, with Mitchell Trubisky struggling after missing a game because of a shoulder injury.\n\nThey were hoping their prized quarterback would build on a solid showing in Week 3 against Washington, when he threw for three touchdowns. Instead, he was erratic, made poor decisions and heard it from the crowd.\n\nTrubisky finished 34 of 54 with 251 yards and two late touchdowns in his first appearance since he was hurt early against Minnesota on Sept. 29. He said his shoulder was fine, but the offense sure is not.\n\nThe run game was once again an afterthought, with Chicago setting a franchise low with seven carries. And the 17 yards rushing were by far the fewest this season.\n\n\u201cWe just have no rhythm,\u201d Trubisky said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about pointing fingers. We\u2019re struggling as an offense.\u201d\n\nAbout all the fans had to cheer for was a 102-yard kickoff return by Cordarrelle Patterson in the first quarter that matched the second-longest in franchise history.\n\nBut after losing at Oakland in London two weeks ago, it was another rough outing for the Bears. They gave up a season-high 424 yards while being held to 252 and managed just four first downs through the first three quarters. It added up to their fifth straight loss to the Saints, and a 1-2 record at Soldier Field this season.\n\nBREAKING IT OPEN\n\nWith a 12-10 halftime lead, the Saints drove 75 yards for a touchdown on the opening drive of the third quarter. A wide open Ted Ginn Jr. hauled in a 45-yard pass and Murray ran it in from the 3 on the next play.\n\nNew Orleans then wasted a big opportunity after Chicago\u2019s David Montgomery lost a fumble on the next drive. The Saints took over at the Bears 29, only to have Wil Lutz come up short on a 52-yard field goal \u2014 his second miss of the day after he made 13 of 14 in the first six games.\n\nBut Taysom Hill caught a 4-yard touchdown with just under three minutes remaining in the third to make it 26-10. And the Saints stayed in control the rest of the way.\n\nBREES BACK\n\nSaints coach Sean Payton kept quiet about a possible return date for Brees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fill you guys in day by day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not targeting. We\u2019ll see how he\u2019s doing. We\u2019ll give you the news when we feel like we\u2019re ready to.\u201d\n\nMANY HAPPY RETURNS\n\nPatterson\u2019s kickoff return for a touchdown was the seventh of his career, tied for third in NFL history behind only Josh Cribbs and Leon Washington, who each had eight.\n\nHe\u2019s the first player to have a kick return for a score at Soldier Field since he did it in Week 7 of last season while with New England. Patterson has three career kick return TDs at the Bears\u2019 home, breaking a tie with former Chicago stars Devin Hester and Dennis Gentry for the most all-time since the team moved to the stadium in 1971.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSaints: CB Eli Apple came up clutching his right knee after his leg buckled trying to defend Javon Wims on a touchdown catch near the end of the game. He said his foot got stuck in the grass and there was \u201cjust an awkward feeling.\u201d Apple didn\u2019t want to talk about any tests. And Payton did not have an update. \u2026 CB Patrick Robinson hurt a hamstring in the first half.\n\nBears: S Sherrick McManis (concussion protocol) left early in the third quarter. He was hurt blocking on a kickoff return.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSaints: Host Arizona next Sunday.\n\nBears: Host the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The New Orleans Saints insisted they were ready for the challenge once Drew Brees went down.
