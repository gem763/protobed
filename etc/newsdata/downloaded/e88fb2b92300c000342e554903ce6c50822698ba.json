It is a nice little story and it must continue, I suppose.\u2019\n\nZouma is in line to start in Chelsea\u2019s Carabao Cup clash against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge tonight.\n\nLampard\u2019s first game in charge was a 4-0 drubbing against the Red Devils at Old Trafford but the Blues have fared better since and are seven points ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s side in the table.\n\nAnd Lampard insists it would have been easy to listen to the critics after that defeat but he was right to stick with his \u2018young\u2019 side.\n\n\u2018There is a lot of noise, win, lose or draw; selection, whatever 11 I pick,\u2019 said Lampard.\n\n\u2018With this big wide world of social media we have now it will be dissected and people will have different opinions and some people who are ex players or ex managers will have different opinions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018For me to have thrown that away after one game at Manchester United and a few opinions, that would have made me a bit of a flip-flopper.\u2019\n\nMORE: Liverpool vs Arsenal TV channel, live stream, time, odds, team news and head-to-head", "description": "Chelsea boss Frank Lampard insists he had no intention of allowing 'fantastic' Kurt Zouma to leave the club last summer.
