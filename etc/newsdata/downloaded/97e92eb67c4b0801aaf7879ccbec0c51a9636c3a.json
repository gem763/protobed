You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nResorts in the Indian Ocean nation aren\u2019t known for their frugality. Last month Conrad Maldives Rangali Island\u2019s underwater Muraka residence opened, at a cost of around $60,000 (\u00a347,000) a night (depending on what the guests want, naturally). The average hotel room in the Maldives costs from around \u00a3400-\u00a31,500 a night, and will likely come with an overwater villa and private butler. We\u2019re in the land of honeymoons and dream holidays, after all.\n\nCoco Priv\u00e9, a private island of only 13,000 sq ft, sleeps 12 in a master residence and in five villas. It\u2019s ideal for, well, those with money to burn. You have to rent the whole island but if you split the cost between 12 people it\u2019s only (ahem) \u00a32,800 per person per night.\n\nPrevious guests of the island include singer Joe Jonas, actor Sophie Turner and Arab royalty. I played A-lister and checked in for a few days.\n\nArrival\n\nCoco Priv\u00e9 is a private island run by Coco Collection, which has two other resorts in the Maldives, Coco Bodu Hithi and Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu. Priv\u00e9 is a 35 minute private speedboat from Mal\u00e9 airport, which is handy given some resorts in the island chain are a 90 minute flight away. While privacy is important, so is efficiency: guests get fast-tracked through security on their way out of the airport.\n\nAs we draw up to the hotel jetty, the hotel staff greet us with cool towels, refreshing mocktails, and a drum for dramatic effect.\n\nAccommodation\n\nThe accommodation is stylishly and luxuriously designed by architect Guz Wilkinson, with all the accoutrements you\u2019d expect from a luxury Maldives hotel: floor-to-ceiling windows (with curtains operated by iPad), indoor and outdoor rainforest showers, a Nespresso machine and kettle, an insanely big bed, fluffy robes, Acqua di Parma toiletries, and a mini-bar containing three types of water: Evian, Voss and Perrier. But no booze, because you can have any drink (or snack) from your personal butler whenever you like. All you have to do is ask.\n\nThere\u2019s a hot tub in the main residence, and some villas have private pools \u2013 all offer direct access to the ocean where you can spot everything from baby sharks to herons.\n\nService\n\nYour wish is the 35 dedicated butlers\u2019 command.\n\nPast requests have seen staff land a seaplane in the middle of the ocean for a guest to have a swim; arrange a black tie dinner on a sandbank a few miles offshore; interview more than 50 entertainers for a client\u2019s children; custombuild a temporary draught beer counter by the beach; buy and fly in specialist gym equipment from the US; and arrange a foam party with a DJ on the beach.\n\nI find it difficult to bring myself to ask for anything too outlandish. I decline the offer of having my unpacking done for me and actually feel like I don\u2019t want to request a drink or a snack because I don\u2019t want to be too much trouble.\n\nFood\n\nThere are no restaurants on the island as such, but there\u2019s a beautiful dining table in the main villa, a kitchen (with staff) open at all hours, and a very well stocked wine cellar and bar.\n\nDespite the fact the island\u2019s chefs are on hand to whip up whatever you fancy, we decide to keep things simple. After an evening of lavish cocktails from the bar, only one thing will do: chicken nuggets, and lots of them. Our simple wish is granted.\n\nHowever, not everything is possible. When I request avocado on toast for breakfast, there is no avocado to be found. I make do with fresh tropical fruit, iced coffee, freshly squeezed juices, bircher muesli, five different types of sausage, bacon, hash browns, halloumi, pastries, bread and yoghurt. Outrageous.\n\nAfter trying out the island\u2019s gym I ask for a protein shake, but as there is no protein powder I made do with a (delicious) mango lassi. If you feel as strongly as I do about avocados and protein powder you can request them in advance. Other than that, everything else is on offer.\n\nActivities\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to do: sunrise yoga, splash around on a paddleboard, whizz over the waves on a jet ski, cinema under the stars, or admire the corals with a snorkel. Staff will happily take you by boat to dive with reef sharks, organise a seaplane to take you island-hopping, or shimmy you away for a day\u2019s fishing.\n\nAfter all that activity, you\u2019ll probably be in need of a massage \u2013 and a masseuse will create a spa in your room in a matter of minutes. There is no need for spa music, the waves provide natural background noise.\n\nThe glass-rimmed infinity pool, surrounded by lush greenery for the utmost privacy, is the focal point of the island. Naturally, lilos, suncream and flip-flops are all provided, and if you\u2019re inclined to embrace the A-list lifestyle, staff will deliver cocktails to the pool or hot tub. The choice is yours.\n\nThere are no locks on the villa doors and everything is open, but despite how small the island is it\u2019s big enough for everyone to find a secluded spot \u2013 be that in a hanging cocoon over the shallow sea or a hammock among the trees. And yes, a drink can be delivered to either of those spots too.\n\nThis is the Maldives, after all.\n\nTravel essentials\n\nBritish Airways flies from London to the Maldives from around \u00a3800 return.", "description": "When it comes to travel, \u00a334,000 can get you quite a lot.
