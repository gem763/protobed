France on Thursday unveiled tax cuts on business and individuals in an effort to boost its economy.\n\nMeanwhile, markets were watching for comments later Friday from European Central Bank chief economist Philip Lane for clues about the direction of central bank policy.\n\nLondon's FTSE 100 climbed 0.8% as tensions over Brexit pushed down the pound, while a measure of U.K. consumer confidence ticked higher.\n\nThe yield on 10-year German bunds slipped to minus 0.590%, from minus 0.580% on Thursday. The equivalent U.S. Treasury yield inched up to 1.690%, from 1.685% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nStocks were broadly lower in Asia, with Tokyo's Nikkei down 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 0.3%. Shares in Shanghai were an outlier, edging up 0.1%.\n\nChina's National Bureau of Statistics said Friday that Chinese industrial profits slipped 2% in August from the year before, after rising 2.6% in July. Producer-price deflation deepened last month, ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers that were already struggling with the prolonged trade war between China and the U.S., official data showed earlier.\n\nStephen Innes, market strategist at AxiTrader, said the weak data highlighted a slowing domestic economy.\n\n\"Industrial profits contracted to send commodity and oil prices lower, suggesting that investors' fragility over oil demand worries will stay in focus into the weekend,\" he said, adding that the worst could be yet to come, as the central bank remains reluctant to lower rates to avoid overheating property markets.\n\nIn commodities, Brent crude futures slipped 0.6% after Saudi oil production normalized more quickly than expected.\n\n\"Strong inventories, ongoing demand concerns, and a perceived fast ramp-up of lost Saudi production have overshadowed geopolitical risks for now,\" said Balint Balazs at Schneider Electric.\n\nLooking ahead, investors will be eyeing coming eurozone business confidence data for September to see if the ECB's easing package had improved sentiment in the region. Better-than-forecast consumer data on Thursday showed that German shoppers remained resilient despite a slump in the industrial sector.\n\nLater Friday, the U.S. is set to publish consumer spending figures.\n\nThe continuing political drama in Washington is likely to remain in focus after a U.S. House of Representatives committee made public a whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 27, 2019 04:58 ET (08:58 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
