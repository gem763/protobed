(AP Photo/Gary McCullough)\n\nFlorida State TE Tre McKitty would like you to know that he didn\u2019t line up facing the wrong direction on accident.\n\nMcKitty became the butt of a ton of Twitter jokes on Saturday during FSU\u2019s 45-44 OT win over Louisiana-Monroe thanks to a screenshot of him facing the wrong way before the ball was snapped.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe current state of Florida State football summed up in one picture. pic.twitter.com/7fLROn1kBB \u2014 George Wrighster III (@georgewrighster) September 8, 2019\n\nBut McKitty said Tuesday that he knew he was lined up the wrong way. And that it wasn\u2019t on accident. McKitty was lined up in the correct direction before the snap after he went in motion, but after their loss to Boise State in Week 1, many people couldn\u2019t resist poking fun at the Seminoles.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with me,\" McKitty said via Rivals\u2019 Warchant.com. \"I definitely didn't line up the wrong way on our snap. \u2026 I'm not really worried about what anyone else is saying. I know what we were doing, what we were trying to do.\"\n\nNew Florida State offensive coordinator Kendal Briles backed up McKitty on Tuesday too. Briles\u2019 offense tries to get lined up as fast as possible at times to keep the defense off-balance and prevent it from substituting.\n\n\"We didn't snap the football with him turned sideways, I don't know if that's something you guys saw,\" Briles said with a smile. \"It's a way to tempo without tempo. It's a stoppage situation, where you can not tempo. So we came off the sideline. It's a thing we do offensively. Guys can line up wherever they want. I don't care. Just get to your spot where you need to get to.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was certainly untraditional. And the result ended up being a good one. Florida State got a first down on the play via one of running back Cam Akers\u2019 35 carries. Maybe Florida State players should start lining up weirdly more often. That could be the secret to upsetting No. 25 Virginia on Saturday.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "A screenshot of Tre McKitty facing the wrong way Saturday quickly became a joke across social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0b4oNXrXYEfN1VA4gyDfjw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/vR5GM8kzPEcNmsJPCDp6nA--~B/aD0yNzg4O3c9NDk1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7e490140-d3f6-11e9-9d55-7bcd0c9d9e66", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
