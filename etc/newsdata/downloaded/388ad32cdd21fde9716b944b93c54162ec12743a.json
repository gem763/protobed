Nobody can joke about anything any more without triggered liberals screaming \u201cracism\u201d and \u201ccancelling\u201d them.\n\nI\u2019ll stop there because I\u2019m sure you have heard this screed before. Conservatives love complaining about how millennial snowflakes can\u2019t take a joke and don\u2019t understand \u201cedgy\u201d humour. In September, for example, the comedian Shane Gillis was dropped from Saturday Night Live after footage surfaced of him making racist, homophobic and misogynistic gags. Gillis responded to the outrage with a non-apology in which he explained that he \u201cpushes boundaries\u201d and takes risks.\n\nComedians should obviously push boundaries and take risks. But punching down has never been remotely risky or funny. This isn\u2019t a development of our \u201cwoke\u201d era; it\u2019s a principle the world\u2019s best comics have always acknowledged. Just look at the 30-year-old video of George Carlin that recently went viral. In the clip Carlin criticises bigoted jokes made by the standup Andrew Dice Clay. \u201cComedy has traditionally picked on people in power,\u201d Carlin says. \u201cWomen and gays and immigrants, to my way of thinking, are underdogs.\u201d He adds: \u201cI think [Clay\u2019s] core audience is young, white males who are threatened by these groups.\u201d\n\nAiah Samba (@Dualityman81) Wow, this is from 1990. And I thought us \u201csensitive\u201d folk didn\u2019t understand the unfunny punching down jokes from these \u201ccomedians\u201d. Interesting pic.twitter.com/2jU5Xj6pA3\n\nAround the same time that Carlin\u2019s comments were going viral, the New York Times published a new interview with Eddie Murphy, who is returning to standup. Murphy, 58, told the Times he isn\u2019t afraid of current controversies over humour, pointing out that he was he was picketed for homophobic jokes he made in the 1980s. It took Murphy a long time to apologise for those jokes and the backlash was partly why he stopped doing standup for years. But you know what? He still has a career. What\u2019s more, he says he cringes when he thinks of his old, \u201cignorant\u201d material.\n\nSo there you are: Murphy is living proof that that political correctness hasn\u2019t killed comedy. He shows that it\u2019s perfectly possible to apologise and evolve, even if it takes a while. I hope Gillis is paying attention.", "description": "A 30-year-old video of George Carlin is proof some standups have long understood the ugliness of attacking underdogs.
