The plays: fourth-and-1 quarterback sneaks (2) in Michigan-Penn State, Tennessee-Alabama and Boise State-BYU. Bodies colliding, legs churning, cleats digging into the turf, a savage skirmish over a painted line on a small pocket of grass on a field 100 yards by 53 1/3. With a multitude watching and waiting on the outcome.\n\nThey were a smashmouth reminder that even as offenses trend continuously to passing and playing in space, and as technology drives decision-making, and as the sport becomes ever more sophisticated, sometimes it still comes down to rudimentary force \u2014 opposing piles of humanity fighting over inches of turf.\n\nYou watch those plays and, understanding the nature of human conflict when football was young, can see why war analogies were (unfortunately) applied to football \u2014 Pickett\u2019s Charge, the Battle of the Marne, the desperate terrestrial struggle for ownership of the land. They are not the same, football and war, and never were. But fourth-and-1 has long been the non-deadly adaptation of trench warfare, especially before fighter jets and the rub route irrevocably changed the dynamics of both military conflict and football.\n\nShea Patterson's tough-nosed sneak on fourth-and-1 helped the Michigan Wolverines stay alive in a game they ultimately lost Saturday at Penn State. (Getty)\n\nEven in 2019, fourth-and-1 still provides riveting football tension. It did Saturday night, a communal drama that played out in places as different as State College, Pennsylvania, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and Provo, Utah. The plays:\n\nStory continues\n\nMichigan had a fourth-and-goal from the Penn State 1, fourth quarter, trailing by two touchdowns midway through the fourth quarter. Quarterback Shea Patterson (3) burrowed behind his center toward the goal line, with fullback Ben Mason quickly smashing his 270 pounds into Patterson from behind to propel him against the mass of Nittany Lions pushing the other way.\n\nPatterson disappeared beneath a pile of humanity, and it took the officials a good 10-15 seconds to find him, with the ball resting on the goal line, and declare it a touchdown. The great Chris Fowler, calling the game on ABC, summed up the play this way: \u201cThat was about as primal as it gets. That was Rutgers and Princeton 150 years ago.\u201d Penn State would hang on in the end, but that touchdown gave Michigan hope for a comeback from a 21-0 deficit.\n\nLater, well past midnight ET, Boise State and BYU settled their game on a similar play. After the officiating crew made a mess of a first-down measurement, the Cougars had a fourth-and-inches from their own 34-yard line with two minutes remaining. Having led 28-10, they were now clinging to a 28-25 lead and trying to finish a major upset of the No. 14 Broncos.\n\nCoach Kalani Sitake went for it instead of punting, a brassy decision, and sent defensive back Austin Kafentzis (4) in to run the sneak. The push from behind actually vaulted Kafentzis over the top of the scrum, pretty much the opposite trajectory of Patterson\u2019s burrow into the pile, and he got the game-clinching first down. Our Yahoo Sports college football Twitter account posted the perfect snapshot of the play:\n\nfootball pic.twitter.com/BXIvlq6nND \u2014 Yahoo Sports College Football (@YahooSportsCFB) October 20, 2019\n\nIn between those two plays was the much less successful and much more controversial Saturday night sneak. That one was attempted by Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano (5), who almost certainly changed the play call at some point before the snap \u2014 perhaps without telling anyone else \u2014 with disastrous results.\n\nFrom the look of the replay, at least a couple of the Volunteers were expecting something off the left edge. Guard Trey Smith pulls to the outside that way and gets an effective block on Alabama linebacker Anfernee Jennings \u2014 but in the process of doing so, he gives a free rush to impact Guarantano as he\u2019s attempting to go over the top with the ball. The fullback appears to have his arms open, either for a fake or real handoff, but he then redirects toward Guarantano when he sees it\u2019s a sneak. The tailback, who is actually linebacker Quavaris Crouch \u2014 a 246-pound thumper who had been used in short yardage before this season, including in this game \u2014 may have been the intended ball carrier to the left.\n\nRegardless, the only ball carrier on the play other than Guarantano turned out to be Alabama safety Trevon Diggs, who picked up the loose ball in the end zone after it was jarred free from the quarterback. He scooted around the end and went 100-plus yards for the game-sealing score. And that summed up Tennessee\u2019s 2-5 season to date.\n\nBut then we had the other old-school moment of the weekend, and this one wasn\u2019t as welcome. Guarantano was intercepted coming off the field by a furious head coach Jeremy Pruitt (6), who jabbed a finger at his quarterback and then reached up and gave a brief yank to Guarantano\u2019s facemask. That\u2019s a coaching technique best left in the past, and not just because the optics are terrible.\n\nHere is the thing about grabbing a facemask \u2014 it is a control mechanism. There is no more effective way to physically control a football player than by the facemask, which is why the smart way to fight during a football game \u2014 if there is such a thing \u2014 is by grabbing the mask. (It\u2019s certainly not uselessly punching someone in the helmet.)\n\nGrabbing the facemask is, in effect, a demeaning act. It\u2019s akin to yanking a horse around by a bridle or a dog around by a leash.\n\nFor the most part, coaches stopped behaving that way (in public) decades ago. Players don\u2019t like it and are far less willing to tolerate it now than in the 1980s or \u201890s. (Lou Holtz and Bill Curry had memorable facemask grabs of players after they committed penalties; there were many others.) Don\u2019t be surprised if Pruitt has to answer questions from recruits, and their parents, about that stunt.\n\nThere was an interesting and unnerving element to the flood of vitriolic support for the coach Saturday night and Sunday, aimed at those who criticized his reaction. It went beyond the predictable decrying of \u201cAmerica Gone Soft\u201d and the declarations that anyone who had a problem with Pruitt never played football (patently false). It triggered a lot of coded talk about masculinity, and the continued conflating of football \u201ctoughness\u201d with being a real man.\n\nHere came the terminology from darker corners of American culture, aimed at Pruitt critics: \u201ccuck,\u201d \u201cbeta,\u201d \u201cincel.\u201d The darker corners of America where men feel like they\u2019re under siege by \u2026 something.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that some people with that mentality would want to co-opt football as some sort of last bastion of male prowess. It is a sport played almost exclusively by males, and it does require toughness to play it well. But having your facemask grabbed doesn\u2019t make a player tough, and grabbing a facemask doesn\u2019t make a coach tough.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign a coach is so limited that he doesn\u2019t have a better means of getting his message across. No great communicator needs to go that route.\n\nGrabbing your quarterback's facemask, Jeremy Pruitt? That ain't it. (Reuters)\n\nFOUR FOR THE PLAYOFF\n\nIf today were Selection Sunday:\n\nTop seed LSU (7) vs. fourth seed Oklahoma (8) in the Peach Bowl.\n\nThe Tigers were held to their lowest point total of the season (36) by Mississippi State Saturday, failing to score a touchdown until late in the second quarter. This mild letdown could be attributed to the game\u2019s place on the schedule \u2014 Florida the week before, Auburn the week after. The LSU defense performed well, holding Mississippi State to seven points until a garbage touchdown with less than a minute to play. Next: Auburn Saturday.\n\nThe Sooners walloped West Virginia 52-14, reversing a trend of two straight games of diminished scoring (from 55 to 45 to 34). The much-improved Oklahoma defense allowed season lows in rushing yards (51) and total yards (242). The only downside to the weekend was Texas\u2019 last-second escape at home against Kansas, which diminished the Sooners\u2019 lone quality win to date. (It did the same for LSU, which beat the Longhorns in September, but the Tigers have also defeated Florida.) Next: at Kansas State Saturday.\n\nSecond seed Ohio State (9) vs. third seed Alabama (10) in the Fiesta Bowl.\n\nThe Buckeyes were authoritative yet again Friday night, demolishing Northwestern 52-3. They extended their season-long streak of leading by at least 17 points at halftime in every game, and posted their biggest victory margin over a Big Ten opponent in two years. (Three years if you don\u2019t count Rutgers as a Big Ten opponent.) Next: Wisconsin Saturday, in a game that was downgraded by the Badgers\u2019 stunning loss to Illinois.\n\nThe Crimson Tide beat Tennessee, as noted above, but lost quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for at least one game after a high ankle sprain. Alabama sent out a release Sunday saying that Tagovailoa had surgery on the ankle \u2014 a \u201ctightrope\u201d procedure that will add stability. It\u2019s the same procedure he had done on his other ankle last year during the period between the SEC championship game (Dec. 1, 2018) and the Sugar Bowl (Dec. 29). For now, all that matters is getting Tagovailoa back at something approaching 100 percent by the time LSU arrives Nov. 9. Next: Arkansas Saturday, a meek opponent who should be handled easily enough by backup QB Mac Jones.\n\nDropped out: Wisconsin.\n\nAlso considered: Clemson, Penn State.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Three signature fourth-and-1 plays Saturday night led to three different outcomes.
