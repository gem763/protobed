I\u2019m looking at the data on the economy and I\u2019m looking at the data on uncertainty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates by a quarter-point at each of its last two meetings.\n\nBarkin said these two moves were \u201cinsurance\u201d and the Fed is watching to see what kind of impact they have.\n\nInvestor expectations of another rate cut at the Fed\u2019s meeting on Oct. 29-30 spiked Tuesday after a weak report on the nation\u2019s factory sector from the Institute for Supply Management. That has always been a critical indicator of the economy\u2019s health for central bankers.\n\nRead: Fed rate cut in October seen as more likely\n\nBarkin didn\u2019t address the ISM report specifically but said manufacturing has been \u201cweak for some time\u201d and could be in a modest contraction.\n\nAsked about the prospects of a recession, Barkin said he was \u201cvery hopeful we\u2019ll see an expansion continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the positive side, consumer spending seems to be strong. People have jobs. That\u2019s a very positive thing. Inflation seems to be firming,\u201d Barkin said.\n\nStocks were broadly weaker for the second straight day after the ISM report.
