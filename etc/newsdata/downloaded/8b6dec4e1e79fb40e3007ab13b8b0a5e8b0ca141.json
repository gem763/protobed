And for the first time, it will come in the form of a Choose Your Own Utterly Terrible Adventure story.\n\nAs things stand, Friday December 13 will be the morning the nation wakes up and for the rest of its life will find itself having to explain both to itself and to its children exactly how it was it came to vote for either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister, theoretically for five whole years.\n\nThat\u2019s right: Johnson or Corbyn for Christmas. I mean I know we\u2019ve been naughty but still. That bad?\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAt time of writing, it is hard to tell which will be worse. Boris Johnson\u2019s Christmas Election itself, which currently looks like it really will happen on December 12, or the six full weeks of terrifying political Christmas gags which are already in full swing. It\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year, when all hope is dying and everyone\u2019s lying, denying and smears! It\u2019s the most\u2026.you get the point.\n\nWhich is, of course, not to say that it\u2019s actually going to happen. Such are the unexpected delights of life in Britain: The Taking Back Control Years, we don\u2019t seem actually to be able to have a general election without the European Union\u2019s say so.\n\nWell, more accurately, we can\u2019t have an election without Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s say so, and his say so far has been to say he\u2019ll only say yes when he finds out how long the latest ditch-death-defying Article 50 extension is. That\u2019s meant to happen on Friday, when the EU will just arbitrarily decide how long to extend our membership of the European Union for, after having to interpret the three contradictory letters our toddler prime minister sent them.\n\nIf they offer an extension until the end of January, thereby, kind of but not really taking no Deal Brexit off the table, Corbyn might have to go ahead and say yes to the election. But then again, he might not.\n\nCurrently, Labour\u2019s honest reasons for not having the election they really really want to have have a half life of up to 24 hours. By this time next week, new reasons will have to be issued on a quarter-hourly basis.\n\nWhat Johnson imagines he might get out of it is anyone\u2019s guess but the latest Classic Dom plan appears to be to give Corbyn an ultimatum he absolutely should refuse but probably won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t vote through the Brexit deal you don\u2019t want, I won\u2019t give you the election you don\u2019t want, either.\u201d\n\nFor some time now, Johnson and his top aides have taken legislating for a general election to be a You Bet! style challenge akin to driving a BMX through the back windows a moving limo.\n\nIn other words, it has to be landed either right after Brexit, before it\u2019s become overwhelmingly clear that it was a terrible idea.\n\nOr, right after the failure to deliver Brexit, whereupon Johnson and Cummings can deliver the election they long for, namely a \u201cpeople versus parliament\u201d campaign, because, frankly, there just isn\u2019t enough hatred and anger out there already, and we could all use a little more.\n\nWhat timing, in its way, that this plan should present itself so clearly on the same day an academic study is published showing that more than half of voters think that violence against MPs is an acceptable price to pay for Brexit (or indeed Remain).\n\nBoth of these are equally bad outcomes so it is hard to know which we should be wishing for. But one things for certain, Cummings and co stand ready to open the sluice gates of lies and hate. Brexit has already ruined millions of Christmas lunches up and down the country, in its three and a half year reign of misery. On this trajectory, Christmas 2019 will be whole orders of magnitude worse. Turkeys, as the the old saying goes, tend not to vote for Christmas. But at least they don\u2019t have to live through it.", "description": "So we\u2019re not getting Halloween Brexit, but it looks like we might get Friday the 13th: Nightmare on Downing Street.
