REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\n\nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong\u2019s premier women\u2019s tennis event scheduled for October has been postponed due to the pro-democracy protests, organisers announced on Friday.\n\nThe city is witnessing a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by a bill that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system. The bill was withdrawn last week, but the protests are continuing.\n\nThe organisers said they are in active discussions with the Women\u2019s Tennis Association (WTA), the women\u2019s tour governing body, to identify an alternate week for hosting the event.\n\n\u201cIn light of the present situation, Hong Kong Tennis Association and the WTA are announcing a postponement of the 2019 Hong Kong Tennis Open. The event will no longer take place during 5-13 October,\u201d organisers said in a statement.\n\nFormer women\u2019s top-ranked players such as Venus Williams, Caroline Wozniacki and Angelique Kerber have participated in previous years in the event, which forms part of the WTA International series.\n\n\u201cThe Open is the flagship event on our annual calendar and one of the most popular international sporting events in the city, attracting thousands of local fans and overseas travellers every year.\n\n\u201cHowever, after extensive discussions with our key stakeholders, we conclude that a smooth running of the tournament can be better assured at a later time,\u201d the organisers said.", "description": "Hong Kong's premier women's tennis event scheduled for October has been postponed due to the pro-democracy protests, organisers announced on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429349269&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0FQ", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
