For it\u2019s those two factors \u2013 growth and inflation \u2013 that ultimately determine longer-term interest rates. Over the short-run, it\u2019s also the natural emotions of fear and greed among investors that move long-term bond yields but this is outside of anyone\u2019s control so it\u2019s moot to consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn sum, if the Fed keeps rates low the short-end of the curve should behave. And if they support the economy and encourage some level of inflation the long-end should also ultimately take care of itself. Taken together this should provide \u2013 to the extent they can \u2013 benign conditions for the slope of the yield curve.\u201d\n\nBRAD GASTWIRTH, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIST, WEDBUSH SECURITIES\n\n\u201cThe stock market still offers some of the best yields out there, if you compare it to fixed income, where yields are next to nothing. What happened today is certainly positive for the stock market, and the market is reacting that way.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL PURVES, FOUNDER AND CEO, TALLBACKEN CAPITAL ADVISORS, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cThe language and the policy change was as expected. It\u2019s an affirmation that the equity and credit markets have been arguably more right than the bond market. The bond market seems to have been predicting much more dire economic conditions. Part of the reason that equities are not moving is that the Fed is affirming that things are pretty good. You saw that in the GDP print this morning. So this certainly will cause some commotion in the bond market and reaffirm equity and credit markets\u2019 more bullish posture. The bond market, I\u2019ve been arguing, is distorted and unusual this year, so much so because of the rest of the world\u2019s weakness.\u201d\n\nCANDICE BANGSUND, ASSET ALLOCATION MANAGER, FIERA CAPITAL, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cThe Fed met the market\u2019s expectations with a 25 bps cut. The accompanying statement conveyed a subtle compromise for the hawks and the doves regarding the future trajectory for policy. In a surprising hawkish-leaning development, the Fed removed the statement that policymakers will \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to sustain the expansion. However, the Fed cushioned the blow somewhat and reinforced that policymakers are not on a pre-set path and will continue to monitor incoming economic data before committing to their next move.\n\n\u201cThis supportive language will ultimately endorse the central bank\u2019s data-dependent approach, with the Federal Reserve leaving the door open to further stimulus if warranted \u2013 helping to appease both the hawks and the doves.\u201d\n\nLESLIE FALCONIO, SENIOR STRATEGIST, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cRight now, the market is not really pricing in anything until next year now in terms of another ease. For the first time in quite some time, market expectation and Fed intention have converged, because for a very long time, the market was well ahead of what the Fed was guiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the market pricing out future rate eases really has to do with the shift in market sentiment: the fact that there\u2019s a ceasefire with China, the fact that a no-plan Brexit is a very small percentage (risk). So because of this, the market\u2019s expectations of continued or worsening slowing growth is less. So what (the market) did is, they took out some eases. That could change very quickly. There\u2019s nothing in writing with trade. But we take from this that the three insurance cuts are in, and now it\u2019s going to be more about what happens with the data.\u201d\n\nBIPAN RAI, NORTH AMERICAN HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, CIBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO\n\n\u201cThere are some takeaways here that suggest that their insurance phase might be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and large the market was positioned for a less dovish or a hawkish cut today, but there aren\u2019t any conclusive signals that the Fed is done just yet. Instead what we got was a language change that has still somewhat left a bit of ambiguity in there. We\u2019re interpreting it as a signal that the Fed will remain on hold for a little while, but again there could be some out there that are a little bit disappointed that there wasn\u2019t really a smoking gun here that the Fed is absolutely done. \u201c\n\nKATHY JONES, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH IN NEW YORK\n\n\u201cIt was pretty much as advertised. They managed to cut rates but not indicate a commitment to further rate cuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would say their description of the economy was a little stronger than I would have thought. The labor market is strong, job gains solid, household spending rising at a solid pace \u2013 all that would indicate that they\u2019re emphasizing that everything is good right now. That would probably indicate that the consensus is not that they would need to cut a whole lot more.\u201d\n\nCHUCK TOMES, ASSOCIATE PORTFOLIO MANAGER, MANULIFE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, BOSTON\n\n\u201cPeople were looking for a higher probability of another rate cut in December and now the Fed has moved to potentially going on pause and making the decisions going forward to be much more driven by the underlying economic data and how that comes out.\n\n\u201cAt an initial glance it is not necessarily either a massive negative or positive for risk assets. It\u2019s more that going forward the outlook for risk assets, whether stocks or other risk assets, will be driven by how the underlying economic data comes to fruition over the next period of time.\u201d\n\nBRETT EWING, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT FIRST FRANKLIN FINANCIAL SERVICES IN TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA\n\n\u201cIt was a quarter-point cut and a dovish message on a forward basis. On Dec 11, they meet again. Our expectation is that without a Phase 1 (U.S.-China trade) deal signed in November, another quarter point would be solidified without a Phase 1 deal. If a Phase 1 deal is signed, they have an opportunity to actually be data dependent or allude to that.\u201d\n\nROBERT PAVLIK, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SLATESTONE WEALTH LLC, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as was expected. The market\u2019s not doing much right now. It\u2019s trying to assess what the Fed said.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left the markets in a bit of a black hole as it doesn\u2019t know what the next move will be. This is a bit of a change from what we\u2019ve been seeing over the past year or two.\n\nThis is almost a distant association of what we\u2019d get under a Greenspan Fed, where you don\u2019t know what the heck they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL ARONE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL ADVISORS, BOSTON\n\n\u201cThe market certainly was expecting the 25-basis point rate cut, that is what we got. The thing that is interesting is folks seem to be zeroing in on this change from the Fed saying they were going to act as appropriate to now something towards they are going to assess the conditions, perhaps suggesting removing the word \u2018act\u2019 means they are less likely to cut rates in the future. I\u2019m not so sure that is the intent here but certainly in the first few minutes folks seem to be zeroing in on that.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, what is interesting is you still had the dissenters to keep rates at the same level, so there seems to be a continued lack of unity about the path forward for interest rates. But the other important signal is that Bullard didn\u2019t dissent meaning that with this cut, at least from his perspective, we are closer to being done with this mid-cycle adjustment.\n\n\u201cThe market is assessing that we are closer to the end of Fed rate cuts at this point. The move in 2-year and 10-year yields over the last couple of weeks upwards suggested that bond investors thought the Fed was going to be near the end of this mid-cycle adjustment. The reaction of the markets today and rates suggest investors are concluding, rightly or wrongly, that the Fed is close to being done with their cuts. If you think about the target Fed funds rate is now roughly in line with their preferred measure of inflation, so it would seem to continue to cut rates would be a bit aggressive at this point.\u201d\n\nMICHAEL CHANG, U.S. RATES STRATEGIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hawkish cut and that\u2019s what we have been expecting. It think it makes sense given that one of the key reasons why (Fed Chairman) Powell has taken a dovish stance this year has been on the back of tail risks tied to Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war. Seems those tail risks have subsided by a good amount over the last few weeks. And U.S. data looked a little bit okay, although there is some weakness here and there. But as long as the tail risks are not as severe as a few weeks ago, I think this is the appropriate action for now.\u201d\n\nJACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CRESSET WEALTH ADVISORS, CHICAGO\n\n\u201cThe Fed delivered exactly what the market expected, lower rates and a more or less just vague outlook. Stocks have been feasting on continued lower rates. If the market slows down in anticipation of an economic slowdown, will the Fed respond and keep lowering rates? My sense is that they probably will.\u201d\n\nJIM POWERS, DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENT RESEARCH, DELEGATE ADVISORS, CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty much what was expected. The more important outcome is they removed the phrase \u201cact as appropriate.\u201d It looks like the market is taking that to mean that there will be a pause in the declining rate path they were on beforehand. That\u2019s what was expected, and that\u2019s generally a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe economy is pretty good and we\u2019re not in favor of lowering rates in a good environment.\u201d", "description": "U.S. stocks firmed slightly and yields on Treasuries gyrated in narrow ranges on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the third time this year, while signaling it might pause its easing cycle.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446645898&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1OB", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
