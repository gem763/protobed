The third phase, which will start in 2021, will be the restoration phase itself,\u201d Chauvet told a news conference.\n\nThe April 15 fire caused the roof and spire of the Gothic landmark to collapse although the main bell towers and the outer walls were saved by firefighters, as well as religious relics and priceless artwork.\n\nAn official cause of the blaze has yet to be determined.\n\nWhen the fire broke out, maintenance work was under way on the cathedral\u2019s spire and scaffolding had been erected. The metal scaffolding poles melted in the fire. Part of the reason for the delay, officials said, was that the deformed poles had to be disentangled from the cathedral\u2019s structure.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has set a target of five years for restoring the cathedral, which would coincide with the 2024 Olympic Games to be held in Paris. But French Culture Minister Franck Riester has said repeatedly that the work should not be rushed.\n\nIn the meantime, Chauvet said he wanted to bring life to the esplanade in front of the cathedral so there was something for visitors to see while the building itself is off-limits.\n\nHe suggested a copy of Our Lady of the Pillar, a statue salvaged from the cathedral\u2019s interior, could be installed there.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nChristophe Rousselot, general delegate of the Notre-Dame Foundation, said there were other projects in the works for the cathedral during restoration.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t leave the worshippers, the tourists, behind barricades for five to seven years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to welcome them properly.\u201d\n\n(This story removes extraneous word in paragraph 2)", "description": "Six months after the massive fire that almost razed Paris' Notre-Dame, the restoration work at the iconic cathedral has not started in earnest and the official reopening date is yet to be determined, officials said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441170011&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1HG", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
