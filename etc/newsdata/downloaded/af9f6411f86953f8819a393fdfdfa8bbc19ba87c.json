(Neal Boenzi/The New York Times)\n\nWhen the FBI released a fat stack of documents about notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn on Friday, there were mentions of Ed Sullivan, Jimmy Hoffa, Detroit Lions fullback Nick Pietrosante, W. Mark Felt (the FBI agent better known as Deep Throat) and Morris Barney Dalitz, a Prohibition Era bootlegger known as Moe who helped turn Las Vegas into a gambling mecca.\n\nOne person whose name did not pop up: President Donald Trump, who relied on Cohn as a lawyer, mentor and more for 13 years starting in the early 1970s, embracing his pugnacious adviser\u2019s hit-back-harder style along the way.\n\nThe format of the release made a definitive digital search nearly impossible, but a close reading of the 748 heavily redacted pages revealed no obvious sign of Trump.\n\nStill, the letters, memos and other papers were a reminder of the unusual realm inhabited by Cohn \u2014 friend to J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI and a regular at once-legendary nightspots, the Desert Inn in Las Vegas and El Morocco in Manhattan.\n\nAdding to the documents\u2019 relevance was their emergence on the heels of a new documentary, \u201cWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?\u201d which returns Cohn to the spotlight with a title quoting the president\u2019s quest for someone to fight for him as fiercely as Cohn once did.\n\nCohn was a singular celebrity by the time he died of AIDS in 1986, weeks after being disbarred for ethical misconduct.\n\nHe had made his name prosecuting Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for espionage \u2014 and pressing for their execution \u2014 and acting as Sen. Joe McCarthy\u2019s Communist-hunting right hand in the 1950s.\n\nLater he became a feared, and fearsome, advocate for mafia boss Anthony Salerno, former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Trump, among others.\n\nThe two men first joined forces when Trump was a young real estate developer being sued by the Justice Department, with his father, for refusing to rent apartments to black tenants.\n\nCohn urged against settling the case, as Trump was considering.\n\n\u201c\u2018Tell them to go to hell and fight the thing in court,\u2019\u201d Trump later recalled Cohn telling him. The Trumps ultimately did settle, but not before filing a $100 million countersuit against the government.\n\nIt was the start of a relationship during which Cohn helped Trump close signature construction deals, sued the NFL for conspiring against his client and prepared an onerous prenuptial agreement for Trump\u2019s first wife.\n\nLike Trump, most of Cohn\u2019s best-known clients do not appear in the just-released documents. Salerno, known as Fat Tony, is an exception.\n\nThe context is Cohn\u2019s complaint to William Webster, the FBI director at the time, that the bureau had \u201cplanted\u201d a 1985 article in the New York Post about the bureau\u2019s efforts to try to wiretap Cohn\u2019s office to obtain information about the Mafia boss.\n\nWebster denies in a letter to Cohn that the FBI fed information to reporters, but a separate memo by a different official acknowledged that agents had conducted surveillance of Cohn\u2019s office \u201cto ascertain the feasibility of installing a monitoring device to intercept the conversations of Genovese boss Anthony Salerno\u201d and a Teamsters contact.\n\nThe vast majority of the documents \u2014 around 600 pages \u2014 cover a period from 1962 to 1964 when Cohn was being prosecuted over accusations that he had fixed a grand jury to head off indictments in a stock-fraud scheme.\n\nDocuments show investigators exhaustively tracing Cohn\u2019s movements around the United States to determine where and when he might have received a piece of the $50,000 payoff at the center of the case.\n\nOne 1962 memo tied to the case noted that \u201ca source of our Las Vegas office has advised that Las Vegas gamblers are greatly concerned over the extreme pressure being applied by the federal government on the Nevada gambling industry.\u201d\n\nA high-ranking Justice Department official, document notes, had been approached \u201cto determine whether he would \u2018trade Las Vegas\u2019 for \u2018Roy Cohn\u2019\u201d \u2014 an overture that was \u201cflatly rejected.\u201d\n\nThe offer, the memo continues, \u201cappears to be a clear indication that the hoodlum element would trade Roy Cohn\u201d if doing so \u201cwould relieve the investigative pressure presently being applied to the Nevada gambling industry.\u201d\n\nCohn was ultimately acquitted in the case he considered a result of a vendetta against him by Robert Kennedy, the attorney general, carried out by Robert Morgenthau, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan at the time.", "description": "When the FBI released a fat stack of documents about notorious New York lawyer Roy Cohn on Friday, there were mentions of Ed Sullivan, Jimmy Hoffa, Detroit Lions fullback Nick Pietrosante, W.
