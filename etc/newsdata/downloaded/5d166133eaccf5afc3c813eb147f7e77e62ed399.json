One of the labs may have become contaminated, the company disclosed, describing this scenario in its statement:\n\n\"In that auxiliary room, five samples were prepared, and three initially tested positive for asbestos. Upon this finding, the laboratory undertook an investigation and determined that a portable air conditioner in use during sample preparation in the auxiliary room was contaminated with asbestos. No asbestos was detected in any of the samples when prepared in the standard room. This finding underscores the importance of investigating any positive test result. Even when careful safeguards are followed, asbestos contamination may be introduced during sample division, storage, preparation and analysis, according to the American Society for Testing and Materials, an International Standards Organization that identifies contamination as a concern in asbestos analysis\" the company said. - Johnson & Johnson statement\n\nJ&J shares are little changed this year compared to a 21 percent gain in the S&P 500.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "The same baby powder lot previously tested by FDA showed no asbestos contamination.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/2016-12-11T215420Z_1_LYNXMPECBA0S6_3_JOHNSON-JOHNSON-TALC-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
