UK restaurants are not forced to label their menus by law, unlike in the US where it has become compulsory since March 2018. The Government last year announced its intentions to introduce compulsory calorie labelling across England, in hope of tackling childhood obesity. A consultation was launched last September as part of the Department of Health's ambitious target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. Former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies recommended nutritional labelling is made compulsory on all supermarket food. NHS figures that show the proportion of children who are severely obese in England has risen by more than a third since 2007.\n\nHowever, this initial decrease was followed by a small weekly increase in calories per transaction over the next year.\n\nSo by the end of the study, the 60 calorie reduction had dropped to just 23 fewer calories for each purchase made.\n\nThis trend increase may happen faster among people with lower incomes, note the authors, although these results should be viewed with caution.\n\nThey point to some study limitations, such as being unable to calculate calories purchased per person or measure meal modification.\n\nThese include adding condiments, drink refills, or how much of each meal was eaten.\n\n'Before drawing conclusions on the overall effectiveness of calorie labeling as a nutrition policy, future research should be done to estimate the effects of labeling over a longer period, especially once restaurants have had sufficient time to reformulate their menus,' the authors concluded.\n\nResearchers at the University of Oxford hailed the findings in a linked editorial.\n\nBut they warned that mandatory labelling may cause restaurants to cram their dishes with salt or sugar to bring down the calories but keep the taste.\n\nAlthough these results may be disappointing to some, they note that small changes to calorie intake can have meaningful effects at the population level.\n\nThey call for 'a multifaceted, cross government approach' to tackle obesity in which calorie and nutrition labelling on restaurant menus should play a part.", "description": "Harvard University researchers found\u00a0people consumed 4 per cent less calories at chains with the nutritional labels in their stores.
