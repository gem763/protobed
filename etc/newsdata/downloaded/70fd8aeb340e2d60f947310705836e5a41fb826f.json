Tse now ranks among the 550 wealthiest people on the planet, according to Forbes\u2019 list of the world\u2019s richest, and is now worth more than President Trump, Steven Spielberg and Starbucks founder Howard Schultz.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBorn in Seattle but schooled in Beijing and Hong Kong, Tse is a recent graduate of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Finance. After graduation, Tse became a Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing.\n\nHe is listed as a director on at least five other company boards in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post, including a firm named for the conglomerate of Thailand\u2019s wealthiest family. Tse\u2019s billionaire father was once a member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consulative Conference, China\u2019s top political advisory group.\n\n\u201cMy parents, seniors and elders genuinely believed in my potential and helped me without expecting any return,\u201d Tse said in a Wharton article spotlighting him. \u201cBy the time I was 19, I was thinking about how I could deliver the same positive energy and passion to the people around me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTse may be a newly minted billionaire, but his star-studded Instagram posts show that he\u2019s occupied the world of the ultrawealthy for years. He smiles next to Yao Ming at the Basketball World Cup, wraps his arm around supermodel Bella Hadid at a Bulgari party in Venice, poses poolside with Princess Charlene of Monaco and snaps a selfie with singer Rihanna in New York. Many of his shots with celebrities are captioned \u201c#casual.\u201d When he\u2019s not among the stars or at Wharton, other posts show Tse jetting over the French Alps, swimming with dolphins in the Bahamas and parasailing in Thailand.\n\nTse joins the ranks of China\u2019s ultrawealthy just as the nation surpasses the United States to claim the biggest share of the world\u2019s richest people for the first time. A report from Credit Suisse this week showed that China accounts for 100 million of those who rank among the top 10 percent of earners on the planet. The U.S. claims 99 million people from the top 10 percent but still outranks China in millionaires, with about 40 percent of the world\u2019s total, according to the report.\n\nDespite his new status, Tse is not interested in being recognized on global rich lists, according to the company statement.\n\n\u201cIn response to nomination for Billionaire List or wealth ranking organized by media or other organizations, [Tse] will endeavour not to participate in such rankings in his own name, and would recommend participating in such nominations in the name of the Tse Ping family,\u201d the company said.\n\nAD", "description": "", "authors": ["Taylor Telford", "Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://washingtonpost.com/pf/resources/images/favicon.ico?d=135", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
