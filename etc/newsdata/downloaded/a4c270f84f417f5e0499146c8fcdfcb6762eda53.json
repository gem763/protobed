Elijah Cummings, who died early Thursday.\n\nThree House committees on Thursday had either a markup session or hearing on the measure, and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat, has said it\u2019s possible the full chamber will vote on the bill during the week of Oct. 28.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s decision last month to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump has helped reinforce predictions that a divided Washington won\u2019t make major progress this year on curbing drug prices or other bipartisan issues. On Thursday, Republican Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas helped illustrate his party\u2019s opposition to the Lower Drug Costs Now Act during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, as he blasted it as a \u201csecret, partisan bill\u201d that\u2019s \u201cbeing rushed to the floor \u2014 just like the secret impeachment investigation.\u201d\n\nBrady, the committee\u2019s top Republican, noted that the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s partial analysis of the legislation found that it could lead to eight to 15 fewer new drugs over the next decade. On the positive side for the bill, the CBO said it would reduce federal direct spending for Medicare by $345 billion from 2023 to 2029.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the table,\u201d Brady said. He called on lawmakers to \u201cwork together to give patients more power to choose the right medicines for them \u2014 to get the incentives right within Medicare to punish bad drug actors and reward lower prices without jeopardizing the innovative cures that give hope to patients and their families.\u201d\n\nRead more: Pelosi\u2019s impeachment inquiry into Trump could derail her drug-pricing bill\n\nAnd see: Top Democrats walk out of contentious White House meeting on Wednesday\n\nThe bill, which was rolled out last month by Pelosi and other top Democrats, would have the government negotiate the prices for a limited number of the priciest drugs in Medicare and the private market. A failure to reach a negotiated price would subject the manufacturer to sizable penalties.\n\nThe measure is \u201cdead on arrival on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate,\u201d said analysts at Height Capital Markets in a note this week, while Beacon Policy Advisors predicted that it \u201cwill become a key messaging tool for Democrats as they look to contrast their accomplishments, particularly on health care, with President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president will look to punch back against the perception of inaction by releasing his own drug-pricing proposals, including one to allow importation and the International Pricing Index (IPI) for drugs in Medicare Part B and certain of the most expensive drugs without competition in Part D,\u201d Beacon\u2019s analysts added in a note.\n\nWashington is focused on drug prices after health care ranked as the most important issue for voters in the 2018 midterm election. Amid the increased attention and range of bills aimed at prices, drugmakers have ramped up their lobbying spending to levels last seen a decade ago.\n\nDrugmakers\u2019 stocks, as tracked by the Invesco Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF PJP, +0.63% , have gained 2% so far this month, cutting their year-to-date loss to 7%.
