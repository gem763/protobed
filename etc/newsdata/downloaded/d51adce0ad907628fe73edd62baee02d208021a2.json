They gave Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump\u2019s private lawyer Rudy Giuliani, an October 16 deadline to provide documents. Giuliani himself received a subpoena, demanding that he produce documents by Tuesday.\n\nLast week, the White House made it clear in a letter to House Democrat leaders that it is not planning to cooperate with the impeachment probe. The White House has dismissed the process as an \u201cillegitimate,\u201d partisan,\u201d and unfair effort to overturn the 2016 presidential election.\n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Mike Esper said over the weekend that he would cooperate with his subpoena. Esper, however, did not explicitly commit to honoring Tuesday\u2019s deadline to provide documents.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the status of what that document preparation is, what restrictions we may have internally with regard to releasing them, the White House has a say on the release of documents as well,\u201d he told Fox News Sunday\u2018s Chris Wallace.\n\nVP Pence and Trump\u2019s Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney have signaled they may not meet their deadline, which falls on Tuesday and Friday, respectively. Given that the president\u2019s executive office houses the OMB, it is unlikely that Vought will comply with his deadline on Tuesday.\n\nAfter Trump blocked him from testifying, the Democrat House chairmen pursuing the impeachment probe subpoenaed Sondland.\n\nRobert Luskin, Sondland\u2019s lawyer, stated last Friday that his client would honor the subpoena. Sondland is scheduled to testify October 17 despite objections from the White House.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sondland\u2019s boss, has stressed his department will fulfill its legal obligations in the impeachment inquiry.\n\nPompeo, however, added that the State Department would take its cues from the White House, which is refusing to cooperate.\n\nGiuliani has not said whether he will comply with the subpoena. His associates, Parnas and Fruman, were in federal custody as of Monday afternoon on unrelated charges of campaign finance violations.\n\nParnas and Fruman are to remain in custody until they each secure a $1 million bond. They have refused to cooperate in the impeachment probe.\n\nEchoing other warnings included in the subpoena letters, House Democrat chairmen pursuing the impeachment probe cautioned Pence that a failure to comply would amount to \u201cobstruction\u201d of justice.", "description": "White House counsel said it will not cooperate, dismissing the process as an effort to overturn the 2016 presidential elections.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/11/Trump-Arms-Crossed-Mandel-NganGetty-Images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
