It also enables consumers to make sustainable purchasing decisions.'\n\nOne car part drivers are urged not to purchase second hand are tyres.\n\nAn undercover investigation in October 2018 by TyreSafe and Trading Standards found that 99 per cent of part-worn tyre traders were selling dangerous tyres.\n\nAll but one retailer it visited sold illegal and dangerous tyres that contravened the legislation governing their sale, the probe found.", "description": "The concept of using recycled car parts for repairs might sound foreign, but it's fairly common in countries like France, Australia, New Zealand and the US.", "authors": ["Rob Hull For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
