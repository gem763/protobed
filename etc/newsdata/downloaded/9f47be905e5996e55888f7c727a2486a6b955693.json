Sulkowicz was protesting the university\u2019s alleged mishandling of a rape allegation that she had lodged at one of her classmates. The university found in favor of the accused. Then, Sulkowicz released a sex tape that attempted to recreate the alleged assault.\n\nAccording to a column by The Cut, Emma Sulkowicz, has been socializing with prominent libertarians. Sulkowicz\u2019s window to right-wing politics allegedly came through a man she met on a Tinder date. The column describes the man as a handsome, \u201cTucker Carlson\u201d-esque conservative. He encouraged Sulkowicz to read Jonathan Haidt\u2019s The Righteous Mind to better understand his worldview.\n\nEventually, Sulkowicz stalked him on Twitter and realized that he was conservative \u2014 \u201clike, very conservative.\u201d At first, she was repulsed and considered breaking it off. But then she thought, \u201cWait, actually, that\u2019s kind of fucked up because he\u2019s the most interesting person I\u2019ve come across, shouldn\u2019t I be open to talking to him?\u201d After dispelling her initial fear, she texted him that it would be \u201cinteresting (progressive? Powerful?) for two people who might be the antithesis of each other to go on a Tinder date.\u201d\n\nSulkowicz quickly became friends with Reason Magazine reporter Robby Soave, an author that was critical of her story when it circulated throughout the media in 2015. Soave\u2019s latest book that covers leftist campus radicals criticizes Sulkowicz directly.\n\nHowever, the column\u2019s author, Sylvie McNamara, seems less than convinced that Sulkowicz\u2019s new social life is an indication of a genuine political shift. McNamara calls Sulkowicz a \u201ctrickster,\u201d implying heavily that Sulkowicz\u2019s entire existence is, in a sense, performance art.\n\nLeaving Robby Soave\u2019s book party, I walk Sulkowicz home through the June heat and she wants to know how I\u2019ll describe her. \u201cYou\u2019re a trickster,\u201d I say, and she asks how I came to that word. I tell her that she seems to relate to the world on the level of mischief and play, rather than through any kind of ideology or strict moral code. I use the word \u201cchaotic,\u201d and she doesn\u2019t object. A friend of hers wrote a book about tricksters, and she says she relates to it. Tricksters, he argued, can move unrestricted between any circumstances, because they\u2019re always playing.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Emma Sulkowicz, who is best known as \"Mattress Girl\" for her \"performance art\" protests aimed at administrators at Columbia University, may have turned over a new leaf including a willingness to speak to conservatives about their ideas.", "authors": ["Tom Ciccotta"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Mattress-Girl-Emma-Sulkowicz-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
