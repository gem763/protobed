The cowbell at the beginning of Honky Tonk Women, the opening track, really made an impact on me. I soon got a drum kit to try to play it myself. Now I have several actual drum sticks thrown into the crowd by Charlie Watts at the end of concerts.\n\nHe even has a copy of the band\u2019s original contract (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nThen, in 1995, I went to my first Rolling Stones concert. It was Sunday, 16 July, at Wembley Stadium.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was a student and had a CD player by then and half of my collection were Stones CDs. But after that concert I started buying more. A year later, at university in America, you could get CDs for four of five dollars, so I could buy an album for \u00a32.50-3.50. In the UK, they were still selling them for \u00a315. CDs over there were cheap, even for a student in America.\n\nWhen did it become more of an obsession and collection?\n\nIt never has been an obsession, but it is most definitely a passion! When I moved back to the UK from America, that\u2019s when I started collecting Rolling Stones posters and trading them with other collectors around the world.\n\nJust a couple of items (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nCan you count how many? (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nIn 1998, the UK tour was postponed. I bought loads of posters from the cancelled shows and started trading them for other shows around the world. There\u2019s a legendary status of posters from cancelled shows, starting from the famous cancelled Cardiff show in 1973 (and Budokan, also in 1973.) Even today I\u2019m mainly a poster collector, or a collector of visual artwork in general. In 2000, my collection was showcased in a front-cover feature in Record Collector magazine.\n\nHow has that love for the band and collecting changed over the years?\n\nIt hasn\u2019t really changed, but it gets harder and harder to find good stuff. Plus I\u2019m more selective because I have so much stuff. I don\u2019t really collect just anything these days. I want a piece to enhance the collection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a 1960s gig poster, I\u2019ll come see it. I\u2019d fly anywhere for the right stuff.\n\nJust a few of his many, many ticket stubs (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nMy quality threshold has gone up. Before, when I didn\u2019t have very much, I\u2019d buy lots of things. But now I really only want the best stuff.\n\nHow much do you think you\u2019ve spent on merch over the years?\n\nA lot.\n\nHa, alright then. What\u2019s the most expensive item you\u2019ve bought?\n\nMy most valuable item is the Rolling Stones\u2019 first contract that Brian Jones signed on behalf of the band.\n\nHe\u2019s now helping the Havana Moon immersive tour (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nIt\u2019s currently on loan for the Rolling Stones\u2019 world-touring Exhibitionism.\n\nCharlie Watts said at the opening in London in 2016 that the contract was the \u2018most poignant\u2019 item in the exhibition.\n\nHow many items do you think you have?\n\nI have tens of thousands of pieces, from commercially available merchandise to rare or one-off items like hand-written lyrics, setlists and promotional items.\n\nDo you think anyone comes close, or you might be in line to get the world record?\n\nThere are several people around the world with great Rolling Stones collections. Some of them specialise in certain areas, like posters or albums. I like to collect rare, one-of-a-kind items. I\u2019m going for the Guinness World Record for the largest Rolling Stones collection on 14 November.\n\nThis is enough to make a grown man cry! (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nHe\u2019s attempting to break the world record (Picture: Matt Lee)\n\nIf you could, what would name as your prized possession?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMy first tour laminate in 2007, which I got as a guest of Ronnie Wood and allowed me to attend any show I wanted.\n\nI also literally bought a shirt off the back of one of the event staff at the free concert in Havana in 2016. I\u2019ll be wearing it to the Havana Moon screenings. That may be my quirkiest find.\n\nWhat do your friends make of your collection?\n\nThe Stones fans ask a lot of questions about it and seem to enjoy seeing the items, especially the rare ones. But it kind of inspires a lot of people. Even non-Stones fans think it\u2019s pretty impressive and ask lots of questions about it.\n\nWe have to ask, where do you keep everything?\n\nI have a room in my flat where I have a mini-museum with lots of things in display cases. I am planning on opening a bigger \u201cmuseum\u201d soon in a dedicated commercial space near my flat. Plus I have multiple storage units.\n\nMillion dollar question, what do the Stones themselves think?\n\nI don\u2019t know how much they know about it, but they are all welcome to come by and see it for themselves.\n\nThe Havana Moon tour culminates at London\u2019s Kentish Town Forum on Sunday 27 October.
