Based on my colleague Dieter Bohn\u2019s hands-on, it seems pretty good, and it\u2019s a lot cheaper than the $999 Pixelbook.\n\nSo now that there\u2019s a midrange Pixelbook, it could be much harder to pick which one of the many Chromebooks should be your next laptop.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for recommendations, Dieter\u2019s got you covered. His top pick as of August 2019 was the Asus Chromebook Flip C434. Obviously, the newly announced Pixelbook Go was not part of his comparison, and we\u2019ll have to wait until The Verge\u2019s full review is out to see just how well the Pixelbook Go stacks up against its competitors. But until our review is out, we can offer a spec-to-spec comparison between Google\u2019s Pixelbooks and some of the most popular Chromebooks from Asus, Dell, Samsung, Acer, and Lenovo:\n\nThis table is best viewed in landscape mode on mobile devices.", "description": "If you\u2019re hungry for a spec-to-spec comparison between Google\u2019s Pixelbook and Chromebooks from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung, we\u2019ve got you covered.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJlYdGHL2284q5__xcBvr5rxvGM=/0x62:2040x1130/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19285169/vpavic_191013_3731_0015.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
