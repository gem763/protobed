But what if you want to talk about your partner to someone else, either to vent, for advice, or simply because a conversation brings up something about them only you would know?\n\nKnowing whether the partner-related topic you want to discuss is fair game or off limits can be difficult to discern.\n\nOff-limits topics vary from couple to couple, since different people have different privacy needs, but generally, any topic that you know will make your partner feel vulnerable and exposed is worth keeping between the two of you, Dr. Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist and faculty member at Columbia University, told Business Insider.\n\n\"If your partner gets emotional at movies about dogs, it may be cute to joke about it with a friend, but anything that involves childhood memories, inner thoughts or secrets, or details or your sex life should not be public knowledge,\" Hafeez said.\n\nHere's how to tell if what you're about to let slip is safe to share, or better off kept to yourself.\n\nAny topic that might make them feel embarrassed or ashamed should be kept private\n\nDiscussions around money, sex, in-laws, substance abuse, and cheating should be kept private unless your partner says otherwise.

In those cases, it's obvious that you shouldn't tell your friends or family, no matter how close you are.\n\nIn most cases though, deciding whether a topic is off-limits for sharing isn't so cut-and-dry. According to Tribeca Therapy therapist Kelly Scott, it all boils down to having compassion for your partner's situation, whatever that might be.\n\n\"You don't want them to feel embarrassed,\" Scott told Business Insider. If you're reluctant to share because the idea of doing so brings up shame, it's a sign you shouldn't be discussing that information outside of your relationship.\n\nTypically, discussions around money, sex, in-laws, substance abuse, and cheating should be kept private unless your partner says otherwise, Scott said. If you're unsure whether it's alright to share with friends, you should ask your partner first or simply refrain, she added.\n\nRead more: The 5 steps all couples need to take if they want to repair their relationship after cheating\n\nIf you don't exercise caution, it could make your partner feel like they can't trust you, and trust is essential for a healthy and happy relationship.\n\nProceed with caution before discussing a topic that could change how the person listening views your partner\n\nConsider how your friends' knowledge of those details could change their perspective of your partner.

If you know the person is quick to judge or already isn't a huge fan of your partner, it could mean they aren't the right person to share those delicate details with.\n\nRather, Scott recommended having these types of vulnerable conversations with someone close to you who also knows your partner somewhat well, or someone you're certain won't judge your relationship based on one problem you're going through.\n\nIf you're unsure who that person is in your life, you could also consider seeing a therapist.\n\nIt's a red flag if you feel like you can't talk about your relationship at all\n\nExercising caution is important when it comes to spilling the beans about your partner's personal life, but if your partner seems overly cautious or controlling when it comes to talking about your relationship with others, that could be a huge red flag.\n\n\"We all have our people we turn to to discuss our problems and need to be able to do that,\" Scott said, adding that if you partner says you can't do that from time to tine, they could be a manipulative person.\n\n\"Controlling people present options not from a mutual win-win but instead to satisfy their own needs,\" relationship expert and founder of LoveQuest Coaching Lisa Concepcion previously told Insider. \"So they'll tell stories as to why you would be seen as a great partner or judged favorably if you just did or said XYZ.
