The problems may also continue into next year, Mr. Segal said.\n\nTwitter called out two bugs that directly affected its ability to target users for advertisers and share crucial data back to measurement partners and advertisers.\n\nThe first bug showed some users ads based partly on inferences it made about the types of devices they were using, even if they had opted out of that type of tracking.\n\nThe second, revolving around a suite of ad products that help marketers promote their mobile apps on Twitter, shared user data such as country codes with measurement and advertising partners, even if users had not given Twitter permission to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been transparent with our partners about the technical issues we have faced with [mobile app promotion], an important area for us,\u201d said a Twitter spokeswoman. \u201cWe\u2019re working to increase stability, performance and scale of the product for the long term.\u201d\n\nTwitter disclosed both problems in August.\n\nWhen Twitter discovered the issues, it turned off the targeting and data-sharing in question, Mr. Segal said.\n\nThat hurt Twitter\u2019s earnings potential because advertisers pay higher rates for more precise ad targeting and measurement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a necessary cut that they had to make,\u201d said Kait Boulos, vice president of marketing at MDC Partners Inc.-owned ad agency Varick. \u201cIn the short term, it\u2019s going to hurt their revenue, but in the long term, it\u2019s the right decision to protect the long-term sustainability of the product and relationship with users.\u201d\n\nBut several advertisers said they had not shifted ad spend away from Twitter during the third quarter and said the fact that these previously disclosed product bugs affected revenue growth came as a surprise.\n\n\u201cThis is a niche problem that might have impacted a few advertisers, but it\u2019s not something that was brought up to us on a daily basis over the last two months,\u201d said Jordan Jacobson, vice president and head of social media for ad agency iProspect.\n\n\u201cWe have followed up with Twitter to get more clarity,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to make sure that everything we did run was correctly targeted.\u201d\n\nTwitter reported $824 million in revenue in the third quarter, up 9% over the year-earlier period, of which $702 million came from advertising, up 8%.\n\nTwitter\u2019s revenue growth in the quarter also suffered from fewer big events and launches than a year earlier, Mr. Segal said.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com", "description": "Glitches in Twitter\u2019s ad-targeting machinery shaved three or more percentage points off the social-media company\u2019s sales growth last quarter by limiting the platform\u2019s ability to precisely target users and weighing down ad prices as a result.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-120522/social", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
