The upcoming ceremony is to formally announce his enthronement before foreign and domestic leaders and representatives.\n\nAlready Japan Airlines Co and All Nippon Airways Co, the two major Japanese carriers, have between them decided to cancel a total of 72 flights at Haneda airport on Oct 21 and 24 to minimize disruptions, and have requested passengers with reservations on the flights affected to switch to different flights.\n\nArrangements are being made for aircraft carrying representatives from Group of 20 countries to arrive at Haneda airport, the sources said.\n\nParking aprons will be prepared for around 20 airplanes at each airport, but the aircraft are expected to stand by at regional airports as there will not be enough space at the two airports over the period.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Up to 140 aircraft carrying foreign dignitaries are expected to arrive at Haneda and Narita airports later this month as Japan holds a ceremony to proclaim the enthronement of Emperor Naruhito, sources familiar with the matter said.
