Mexican lawmakers have already done so.\n\nA statement from Trudeau\u2019s office said: \u201cThe Prime Minister and the Speaker discussed progress on the new North American Free Trade Agreement and welcomed ongoing work towards its ratification.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is pressing lawmakers to quickly ratify the USMCA, which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, but Democrats who have the House majority say they will proceed only when their concerns have been addressed.
