They have heaped fresh pressure on a newly rejiggered Boeing senior management team fighting to repair trust with airline customers and passengers shaken by an eight-month safety ban on its 737 MAX.\n\nThe CEO began his remarks by turning and looking directly at family members of the victims seated closely behind him as he apologized for the lives lost in the two crashes.\n\nIn the most intense exchange at the hearings so far, Representative Steve Cohen from Tennessee on Wednesday thundered at Muilenburg, \u201cWhat does accountability mean \u2013 are you taking a cut in pay? Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem? These people\u2019s relatives are not coming back, they\u2019re gone. Your salary is still on,\u201d he said, gesturing to the family members at the hearing.\n\n\u201cCongressman, it\u2019s not about the money for me,\u201d Muilenburg said. He later added that he and other executives would not receive bonuses this year.\n\nRepresentative John Garamendi of California ticked off \u201cserious quality issues\u201d on other Boeing flagship aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner and KC-46 aerial tanker.\n\n\u201cYou have a systemic problem in your company,\u201d Garamendi said. \u201cYou are pushing profits over quality and safety.\u201d\n\nBoeing\u2019s shares were down nearly one percent in afternoon trading.\n\nSOFTWARE MISTAKES\n\nThe hearing focused on the company\u2019s anti-stall system known as MCAS - which automatically and repeatedly pushed the plane\u2019s nose down in both crashes as pilots fought for control.\n\nLawmakers released Boeing documents that showed the company had considered adding an MCAS failure alert on the flight control panel to the 737 MAX. Another Boeing document warned that if a pilot failed to respond in more than 10 seconds to the software, activation could lead to a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d failure.\n\nMuilenburg acknowledged, \u201cWe made some mistakes\u201d when developing MCAS.\n\nFor months, Boeing had largely failed to acknowledge blame, instead vowing to make a \u201csafe plane safer.\u201d The hearings represented Boeing\u2019s broadest acceptance of responsibility that it made mistakes, but Muilenburg stopped short of what some lawmakers and victims\u2019 families demanded.\n\nRepresentative Peter DeFazio, who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee holding Wednesday\u2019s hearing, blasted Boeing for a \u201clack of candor\u201d and pressed Muilenburg on why MCAS was vulnerable to a single point of failure.\n\nThe 737 MAX, when regulators lift the safety ban, will have a number of new safeguards. It will take data from two key sensors that measure the \u201cangle of attack\u201d - or angle of the wing to the airflow - instead of one, and only let MCAS activate a single time.\n\nBoeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg testifies before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee during a hearing on the grounded 737 MAX in the wake of deadly crashes, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 30, 2019. REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger\n\nRepresentative Rick Larsen of Washington state, where Boeing builds the 737, asked Muilenburg to name three mistakes Boeing made.\n\nMuilenburg quickly listed Boeing\u2019s failure to disclose for months that it had made optional a cockpit alert flagging disagreement between the airflow sensors. \u201cWe got that wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nMuilenburg also said, \u201cClearly, we had some areas to improve\u201d regarding MCAS. And finally he said the company should have been more \u201cefficient and comprehensive\u201d in its communications and documentation \u201cacross all of our shareholders.\u201d\n\nBut Muilenburg deflected a follow-up question on whether he could name specific individuals who were to blame for these mistakes, saying larger \u201cteams\u201d were responsible.\n\nDeFazio also questioned why Boeing scrapped initial plans to install a MCAS \u201cannunciator\u201d alert and how pilots could be expected to recover if the system failed, when Boeing failed to disclose details on the MCAS system to pilots. He also hammered Boeing\u2019s assumptions on how long it would take pilots to respond to a failure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of pissed off pilots,\u201d DeFazio said. \u201cWe need reforms on how commercial aircraft are certified,\u201d he concluded.\n\nDIRECT APOLOGY TO FAMILIES\n\nMuilenburg told reporters that he had met with some family members of the victims before the Wednesday\u2019s hearing and later said he regretted not meeting with them sooner.\n\nIn an earlier statement, DeFazio said the panel was aware of \u201cat least one case where a Boeing manager implored the then-vice president and general manager of the 737 program to shut down the 737 MAX production line because of safety concerns.\u201d Boeing did not comment Tuesday on the allegation.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nMuilenburg told reporters he believes the allegation was in response to concerns about a change in the increase of the production rate. He said Boeing was aware of those concerns and had acknowledged them.\n\nToward the end of the hearing, Representative Jesus Garcia of Illinois called for Muilenburg\u2019s resignation, saying Boeing was either negligent, incompetent or corrupt, starting at the top. Garcia added. \u201cI think it\u2019s time that you submitted your resignation, don\u2019t you?\u201d", "description": "Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was repeatedly hammered by U.S. lawmakers at a hearing on Wednesday over his compensation and key mistakes in development of the 737 MAX that he newly acknowledged.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446610767&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1LK", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
