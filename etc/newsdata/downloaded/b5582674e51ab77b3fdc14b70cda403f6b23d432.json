One Hong Kong legislative counselor commented, \u201cWe Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.\u201d\n\nBloomberg reports that Apple CEO Tim Cook has defended the company\u2019s decision to remove the HKmap.live app from its store, stating that they had received \u201ccredible information\u201d from authorities that the software was being used \u201cmaliciously\u201d to attack police.\n\nThe company has flip-flopped repeatedly on whether the app should be allowed in the store, initially telling developers: \u201cYour app contains content \u2013 or facilitates, enables, and encourages an activity \u2013 that is not legal \u2026 specifically, the app allowed users to evade law enforcement,\u201d and banning the app.\n\nFollowing an outcry over the initial banning, the app was reinstated to Apple\u2019s store. Now, following criticism from the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s main newspaper, The People\u2019s Daily, which stated that the app \u201cfacilitates illegal behavior,\u201d leading it to question if Apple was \u201cguiding Hong Kong thugs,\u201d The Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have once against bowed to the wishes of communist China and removed the app.\n\nCook wrote in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News: \u201cOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\u201d\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL), criticized Apple stating: \u201cApple\u2019s decision to cave to Communist China\u2019s demands is unacceptable. Putting profits above the human rights and dignity of the people of Hong Kong is wrong. No ifs, ands or buts about it.\u201d\n\nCook addressed criticism the firm has received for removing the app stating: \u201cThese decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts. In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\u201d\n\nCharles Mok, a legislative counselor in Hong Kong, stated that Apple\u2019s decision had left him \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d and contested the company\u2019s reason for removing the app in an open letter to Cook. \u201cThere are numerous cases of innocent passersby in the neighbourhood injured by the Hong Kong Police Force\u2019s excessive force in crowd dispersal operations,\u201d Mok wrote in the letter. \u201cThe user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed.\u201d\n\nMok continued to state: \u201cWe Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.\u201d\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated Beijing\u2019s stance when questioned about Apple\u2019s removal of the app stating: \u201cRecent events in Hong Kong are extreme, violent acts, challenging Hong Kong\u2019s rule of law and order, threatening the safety of Hong Kong\u2019s people, damaging Hong Kong\u2019s stability and prosperity. We should oppose such violence instead of supporting or condoning them.\u201d\n\nTim Cook told Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) in a December 2017 letter: \u201cWe believe our presence in China helps promote greater openness and facilitates the free flow of ideas and information. We are convinced that Apple can best promote fundamental rights, including the right of free expression, by being engaged even where we may disagree with a particular country\u2019s law.\u201d\n\nWhat Cook failed to mention is that the firm generates $44 billion in sales in China every year, pulling out of the country entirely could be catastrophic for the firm. China is also the primary manufacturer of Apple products such as iPhones, it seems extremely unlikely that the firm would leave behind its vast network of suppliers and assemblers who build hundreds of millions of iPhones for the company every year.\n\nTim Cook\u2019s full recent memo can be read below:\n\nTeam, You have likely seen the news that we made the decision to remove an app from the App Store entitled HKmap.live. These decisions are never easy, and it is harder still to discuss these topics during moments of furious public debate. It\u2019s out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision. It is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different. The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots, and other information. On its own, this information is benign. However, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law. Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm. We built the App Store to be a safe and trusted place for every user. It\u2019s a responsibility that we take very seriously, and it\u2019s one that we aim to preserve. National and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts. In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\n\nBreitbart News will continue to report on Apple\u2019s actions in Hong Kong and China.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.
