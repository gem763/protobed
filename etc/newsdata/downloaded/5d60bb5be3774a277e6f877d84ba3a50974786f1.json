We\n\nwon't be in the international capital market in 2019,\" said\n\nPatience Oniha, director general of the government debt agency\n\nknown as DMO.\n\nOniha said the country's 2019 budget had only six months for\n\nimplementation, due to the late passage of the bill. The\n\ngovernment aimed to start its budget implementation for 2020 in\n\nJanuary, she told Reuters in an email.\n\nThe DMO had said in June that the government wanted to first\n\naccess cheap funding from multilateral and bilateral lenders and\n\nthen raise any balance from commercial sources, possibly\n\nincluding security issuance such as eurobonds. Nigeria, which emerged from recession in 2017, has borrowed\n\nabroad and at home over the past three years to help finance its\n\nbudgets and fund infrastructure projects, but debt service costs\n\nare also rising.\n\nThe government approved a three-year plan in 2016 to borrow\n\nmore from abroad. It wants 40% of its loans to come from\n\noffshore sources to lower borrowing costs and help fund\n\nrecord-high budgets.\n\nEarlier this month, President Muhammadu Buhari presented a\n\nrecord 10.33 trillion-naira ($33.8 billion) budget for 2020 to\n\nparliament, which he expects to be partly financed via foreign\n\nborrowing plus the proceeds of privatisation. = 306.95 naira)", "description": "REFILE-Nigeria has no plans to go to international debt market this year", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_1_800x533_L_1413124982.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
