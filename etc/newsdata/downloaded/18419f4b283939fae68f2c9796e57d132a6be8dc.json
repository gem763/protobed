The town of Kullu is filled with ancient temples which each have their own legend attached to them - giving it this spiritual name.\n\nSantosh Mishra, 71, tried paragliding over the picturesque Himalayan town of Kullu, in northern India's Himachal Pradesh, on October 12\n\nAnd in the footage, a wide smile spreads across the retired woman's face and would lead some to believe she has done this before.\n\nIt is thought that she wanted to attempt the sport on her son's birthday, according to Nyooz TV.\n\nMs Mishra, who has two grandchildren and is from Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh in India, makes occasional conversation with her pilot and keeps daring to go further with her selfie-stick.\n\nShe lengthens the phone accessory and does not appear phased by loosening her grip, as they travel across the clear skies.\n\nShe then giggles in the euphoric feeling of flying over the dramatic landscape and catches a glimpse at the drop.\n\nMs Mishra chats to her pilot while flying over Kullu, otherwise known as the 'valley of the Gods'. The town is filled with ancient temples which each have their own legend attached to them\n\nDressed in a knitted jumper and clutching a scarf, she appears cosy and comfortable while in mid-air.\n\nMs Mishra occasionally shuts her eyes and soaks in the sun during the journey.\n\nHer pilot looks back and checks the view over his shoulder while his guest appears much more relaxed.\n\nThe grandmother, who is from Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh in India, extends her selfie-stick further for a wider view. She wraps up in a knitted jumper during the flight -which she decided to try out on her son's birthday\n\nMoments later, they make their slow descent to land and she waves to people as she revels in the success of her trip.\n\nAfter landing safely, the woman gracefully thanked the pilot for his efforts.\n\nThis comes just two months after Jean Spierling, 92, went paragliding in Pemberton and Simon Chippindale, 72, died after crashing during his flight over Wiltshire.\n\nIan Meekcoms's emergency parachute spiralled out of control and he died while paragliding over the Himalayas in 2016.", "description": "Santosh Mishra, 71, tried paragliding for the first time over the Himalayan town of Kullu, in northern India, on October 12.
