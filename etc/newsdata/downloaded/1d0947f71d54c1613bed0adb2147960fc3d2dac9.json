Okay, you obviously already know from the title of this story, but the legendary Jennifer Aniston is at the top of my list.\n\nTBH, I, like many, have had an infatuation with Jen and her effortless style ever since I first started watching Friends in the '90s. (I still watch the Netflix repeats every night before I go to bed.) While I coveted her on-camera persona Rachel Green's '90s and early '00s casual-cool looks, it's Jen's real-life wardrobe\u2014spanning everything from tried-and-true denim favorites to tailored silhouettes\u2014that's consistently influenced me. Given her longtime affinity for staples rather than gimmicky trends (mixed with the fact that the '90s are back with fervor), it's really no surprise that Jen's signature silhouette has remained timeless for decades.\n\nIn fact, I bet if I had the privilege to go on a little shopping date with Jen (something I do think about on the regular, don't judge), I imagine we'd each stock up on fresh and forward basics to add to our simple and sophisticated arsenals. Keep scrolling to check out the fall 2019 basics I think Jen would covet based on the essentials that have been working hard in her wardrobe for years. And Jen, if you read this, DM me.\n\nView photos\n\nOn Jennifer Aniston: Bottega Veneta Single-Breasted Blazer ($2545); Chanel bag\n\nIt's no secret that tossing on a blazer adds instant sophistication to any outfit. Jen is clearly well aware of this (ahem, this sleek fit). I know she'd totally feel all the reworked blazers featuring slouchier fits and classic patterns that just hit the shelves this season.\n\nShop blazers:\n\nView photos\n\nChelsea28 Double-Breasted Plaid Blazer ($129)", "description": "Let's hang out, Jen.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r2gPPfLfYOw6koJoTgXg6A--~B/aD05MzM7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/who_what_wear_581/9968c238dce9f36f3493d12400ba05e0", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
