An Akrapovic exhaust system lets you know this beast is not cut off the ordinary cloth.\n\n\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nComponents like the front splitter and rear wing are made of natural fibre composite, aiding in a total weight of just 1 350kg. The suspension has also been tweaked to handle the rigors of track racing with a MacPherson strut setup in the front while the rear features a multilink with KW dampers at the front and rear.\n\nNot for use on public roads\n\nA six-piston front and four-piston rear braking system provides more than adequate stopping power. Pirelli tyres all-round provide the grip. Besides being fast, it also needs to be safe and for that, a high-strength roll cage and FIA-standard racing seat with six-point harness keeps the driver safe at all times.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nThe interior also features a carbon fibre instrument panel with a display and steering wheel specifically designed for GT4 competition.\n\nThe planned car price is \u20ac175 000.\n\nCompiled by: Robin Classen", "description": "Toyota Gazoo Racing confirmed it will start the sales of the GR Supra GT4, starting from March 2020 to Europe.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7459/9b3efe2cad484fe59be8bb9c7599c567.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
