Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Republican, said in a statement released Thursday that the \u201cskinny\u201d version of the massive National Defense Authorization Act will \u201cextend necessary authorities, take care of our troops and their families, authorize military construction projects, and conduct oversight over military acquisition programs.\u201d\n\nHe explained that he and the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate armed services panels have made \u201cgood progress\u201d on the defense policy bill but \u201chaven\u2019t yet reached a final agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cA skinny bill is not a substitute for a full bill, but it might be a necessary next step if we don\u2019t reach an agreement soon,\u201d Mr. Inhofe continued.\n\nThe NDAA is traditionally the vehicle for Congress to weigh in on a host of military and security-related issues, while setting the budget guidelines for the year ahead.\n\nMr. Inhofe\u2019s comments come just one day after Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, told a group of reporters that \u201cCongress has not done its job\u201d in funding the military. The Pentagon has been operating on a continuing resolution since lawmakers missed a key deadline to pass the complete 2020 budget on Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year.\n\nThe temporary solution expires on Nov. 21, and there is little among lawmakers optimism that a final agreement will be reached by that time.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
