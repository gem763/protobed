Three local experts choose their favourites\n\n\u2018Ramen doesn\u2019t have rules the way many Japanese foods do, which means the possibilities are endless,\u201d says Abram Plaut. \u201cAnd in Tokyo people are always coming up with ideas that have never been done before.\u201d\n\nPlaut\u2019s fascination with the noodle soup started when he arrived in Japan to teach English a decade ago. Ramen was cheap, plentiful and, thanks to the automated ordering machines, easy. He was hooked. But his hobby became an obsession, and within a few years he was writing articles on the subject and appearing on TV as an expert. In 2016, he helped open Mensho Tokyo SF in San Francisco with master ramen chef Tomoharu Shono.\n\nNoticing a lack of English-language resources for ramen novices in Japan, Plaut teamed up with friends and fellow noodle aficionados Hiroshi Shimakage and Patrick Brzeski, the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Asia bureau chief, to launch Ramen Beast, a free-to-use app with hundreds of independent listings designed to help confused outsiders navigate Tokyo\u2019s complex ramen subculture.\n\n\u201cThe volume and diversity of ramen shops in Tokyo can be overwhelming,\u201d Brzeski says (few have websites), \u201cbut it\u2019s also incredibly inspiring.\u201d Between the three of them, he estimates they\u2019ve eaten at several thousand places, ranging from mum-and-dad operations to a Michelin-starred number where bowls come dusted with fresh truffle shavings.\n\n\u201cIn this one food scene, you could eat a new gourmet meal for under \u00a310 every day for the rest of your life,\u201d Brzeski adds.\n\nOut of more than 10,000 ramen joints in the city, here are 10 the trio say should be on your culinary hit list.\n\nKonjiki Hototogisu\n\n\u201cExpect premium ingredients artfully crafted into perfectly balanced bowls,\u201d Shimakage says. \u201cThe master, Yamamoto-san, is known as one of the first ramen chefs to use hamaguri clams in his signature soup.\u201d These bivalves, along with a touch of sea bream, add an evocative depth to the broth. Although Konjiki Hototogisu became Tokyo\u2019s third ramen joint to win a Michelin star last year, the Ramen Beast crew have been fans of Yamamoto\u2019s shio ramen since he was serving out of a tiny eight-seat shop. Fame hasn\u2019t gone to the master chef\u2019s head, though, or diminished his food\u2019s superb quality. \u201cLight, clean, delicate, yet bursting with umami, this bowl is not one to be missed,\u201d Shimakage says.\n\n\u2022 2-4-1 Shinjuku, 22 Kyutei Mansion 1F, Shinjuku, +81 3 5315 4733, daily 11.30am-3pm, 6.30pm-10pm\n\nMenya Shichisai\n\n\u201cOnce you give your ticket, the guy kneads out the dough and then cuts the noodles fresh, which is somewhat uncommon in the ramen game,\u201d Plaut says. It\u2019s mesmerising to watch these toothsome tangles materialise before your eyes. \u201cThis is one of the most famous shops serving kitakata ramen in Tokyo,\u201d Plaut adds. This style, originally hailing from Fukushima prefecture, consists of a clear soup with rustic, wavy noodles laced with a funky undertone of niboshi (dried sardines).\n\n\u2022 2 Chome-13-2 Hatchobori, Chuo, +81 3 5566 9355, Mon-Fri 11am-3pm, 5pm-10pm; Sat-Sun 11am-3pm, 5pm-9pm, on Facebook\n\nMensho Tokyo\n\nWith nine shops spread across the city, each with a distinct menu and concept, chef Tomoharu Shono \u2013 who expanded the chain to San Francisco with Plaut\u2019s help \u2013 holds a place of reverence in the world of Tokyo ramen and has a reputation for daring combos, such as lamb spiked with dark chocolate, reminiscent of Mexican mole. \u201cThe speciality at this flagship branch is a tonkotsu gyokai [pork bone and dried fish] soup \u2013 umami-rich and simply outstanding,\u201d says Plaut.\n\n\u2022 1 Chome-15-9 Kasuga, Bunkyo City, +81 3 3830 0842, Wed-Mon 11am-3pm, 5pm-11pm, menya-shono.com\n\nMotenashi Kuroki\n\n\u201cVisit this shop on Fridays, when the daily house speciality is ramen or tsukemen [dipping noodles] made with a duck-based shoyu soup topped with juicy slabs of duck meat and a thin wedge of kabosu citrus fruit,\u201d Plaut says. Chef Naohito Kuroki\u2019s fine-dining roots can be seen in his fanatical attention to detail. During the rest of the week, patrons at the 13-seater have to content themselves with the classic shio, made with a custom blend of six types of salt, or his seasonal hiyashi chuka (cold noodles).\n\n\u2022 2-15 Kanda Izumicho, Chiyoda, +81 3-3863 7117, Mon-Tues, Thur, Sat 11.30am-3pm, 6pm-9pm; Fri 11.30am-2.30pm, 6pm-8.30pm\n\nSupaisu Ramen Manriki\n\n\u201cAs soon as you walk through the door, you\u2019ll get a blast of this shop\u2019s signature spices,\u201d Plaut says. Order a cold Sapporo to wash down incendiary bowls loaded with fiery ingredients from around the globe. \u201cThe soup here references spicy miso ramen, but it has so many exotic flavours melded together that it\u2019s a bowl without a genre. Red chilli and Sichuan peppercorns deliver the kick, while Indian curry notes keep you guessing.\u201d\n\n\u2022 3-16-5 Nishi-Kasai, Edogawa-ku, +81 3 6848 1346, Thur-Tues 11.30am-9.30pm, manriki.net\n\nMenson Rage\n\nWhen Menson Rage stepped on to the scene in 2015, its chefs took classic ramen conventions and tossed them out of the window. The result is a hip, laid-back space serving revelatory bowls of noodles. Squeeze past the parked bikes and skateboards into a modern restaurant where the shop\u2019s master, a \u201cfriendly young dude named Hirota-san, prepares incredibly refined shoyu ramen made using a type of fighting cock originally from Thailand\u201d, Brzeski says.\n\n\u2022 3 Chome-37-22 Shoan, Suginami, Mon, Wed-Sat 11am-3pm, 6pm-9pm, Sun 11am-4pm\n\nMugi To Olive\n\nThese noodles get a savoury kick from an unconventional source. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve eaten about half your bowl, grab one of the bottles of olive oil sitting on the counter and add a generous splash,\u201d Plaut says. It might sound strange, but it works. \u201cThe virgin oil harmonises surprisingly well with the house speciality soup, made from chicken with niboshi and hamaguri clams, while altering the flavour profile of the dish.\u201d\n\n\u2022 6-12-12 Ginza, Chuo-ku, +81 3-3571-2123, Mon-Fri 11.30am-10pm, Sat 11.30am-9pm\n\nUchoku\n\nWord spread fast about this slick arrival that debuted at the end of 2018. Ramen is available, but the speciality here is the dipping variety, tsukemen, which comes with a lovely soup made with skipjack tuna, kombu (seaweed) and chicken for dipping. After you\u2019ve slurped up your house-made noodles, pour a little extra dashi into the rich stock to dilute it, then drink it down to the last drop.\n\n\u2022 3-10-16 Amanuma, Suginami-ku, Mon-Fri 11.30am-3pm, Sat-Sun 11.30am-4pm\n\nTeppanyaki Kishin\n\n\u201cOriginally, Teppanyaki Kishin wasn\u2019t even a ramen shop, but a traditional iron-griddle joint. However, several months after it opened in 2016, it started offering a special ramen menu at lunchtime \u2013 and the idea is genius,\u201d Plaut says. For those with fancier tastes, an indulgent bowl topped with blood-rare slices of Kobe beef should hit the spot.\n\n\u2022 17-10 Sarugakucho, Shibuya-ku, +81 3 6427 0952, Mon-Fri 11am-11pm, Sat-Sun noon-11pm\n\nHomemade Muginae\n\nA smash hit since it opened in 2016, Muginae is known for its luscious broth made from free-range Yamagata chickens. Details matter here, which is why the chefs exclusively use Japanese flour for their springy, house-made noodles, as well as two kinds of shoyu from Hyogo and Nagano prefectures for the explosively flavourful tare (seasoning). All that care adds up to shoyu ramen that stands out from the masses.\n\n\u2022 6 Chome-11-10 Minamioi, Shinagawa City, +81 3 3298 5158, Sat-Sun 11.30am-3pm, Mon-Wed and Fri 11.30am-2.30pm, 6pm till sold out", "description": "Ramen is Japan\u2019s national obsession \u2013 and there more than 10,000 shops to choose from in Tokyo alone.
