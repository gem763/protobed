The administration later released the aid.\n\nAsked whether the White House decision to withhold military aid to Ukraine had harmed national security, Esper said: \"I'm not going to get into any of that right now... As I've said on many occasions, I'm trying to keep (the Pentagon) out of politics and obviously that is all the news today.\"\n\nEsper told reporters he had also emphasized to Zahorodnyuk the need for European allies to also help Ukraine and that the burden should not fall on the United States.
