Federer, the five-time champion who was seeded third, fell in five sets to 78th-ranked Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday. Hours earlier, Wawrinka was ousted in his quarterfinal match by Daniil Medvedev after the 2016 champion had eliminated top-ranked Novak Djokovic in the previous round.\n\n\u201cThis is not a good thing,\u201d Bencic said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy about this actually.\u201d\n\nBencic began the season by partnering with Federer to win the Hopman Cup in January. Now she can join him as a major champion. Federer is the men\u2019s career leader with 20 Grand Slam singles titles.\n\n\u201cI think the dream of every tennis player obviously is to win the biggest tournaments,\u201d Bencic said. \u201cI think for sure being No. 1 in the world or winning a Grand Slam is always a dream. But I think it\u2019s still a long way to that.\u201d\n\nSERENA VS. ELINA\n\nSerena Williams looked all but unbeatable in her quarterfinal match, which she won in a mere 44 minutes.\n\nSo Gael Monfils knows Elina Svitolina will be facing a tough opponent and a tough crowd, but he thinks his girlfriend will be ready for it Thursday night.\n\n\u201cShe has nothing to lose,\u201d Monfils said. \u201cShe knows well Serena. She knows the crowd is going to be against her.\u201d\n\nSvitolina will be playing in her second straight Grand Slam semifinal, after losing to eventual champion Simona Halep at Wimbledon. She is looking for her first major title.\n\nWilliams has won 23 of those, including six at the U.S. Open. She looked like the favorite to win another in her 6-1, 6-0 rout of Wang Qiang on Tuesday.\n\nMonfils thinks the key for Svitolina, who beat Williams in the 2016 Olympics, will be to prevent her from a fast start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tricky one at the beginning, I would say, for both,\u201d Monfils said, adding that if Williams \u201cshould come in slow, I think Elina will be there.\u201d\n\nMonfils couldn\u2019t give the couple two semifinalists, falling to Matteo Berrettini in a quarterfinal match that went to a fifth-set tiebreaker.\n\nHALFWAY HOME\n\nHalf the spots in the ATP Finals have been filled.\n\nDaniil Medvedev clinched his first appearance in the season-ending tournament with his victory over Stan Wawrinka in the U.S. Open quarterfinals. That victory was worth 360 points for the Russian and pushed him over 4,000 for the season in the race to London standings.\n\nRafael Nadal is first, followed by Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. They were the first three players to qualify for the eight-player tournament.\n\nThe ATP Finals will be played Nov. 10-17 at the O2 Arena.\n\nMedvedev plays unseeded Grigor Dimitrov on Friday for a spot in the U.S. Open final.\n\nADDITION ON THE AVENUE\n\nBillie Jean King helped unveil a new addition on the grounds of the U.S. Open.\n\nShe and Rosie Casals unveiled pavers honoring Gladys Heldman and the entire Original 9 on the USTA Foundation\u2019s \u201cAvenue of Aces.\u201d\n\nKing and Casals were both members of the Original 9. Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Original 9 and the signing of their $1 contracts with Heldman, signifying the birth of women\u2019s professional tennis as it is known today.\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Belinda Bencic knew there was sadness in Switzerland after Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka departed the U.S. Open on the same day.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Brian Mahoney"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/04/us_open_tennis_11300_c0-95-3028-1860_s1770x1032.jpg?37d0d10b45ac092859b06a3bab10cfe3bef1a61a"}
