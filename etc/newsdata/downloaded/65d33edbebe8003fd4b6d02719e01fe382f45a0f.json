Even natural fibres such as cotton have a huge carbon footprint and require a large portion of the world\u2019s pesticides.\n\nIn a bid to solve this disastrous environmental equation, scientists and designers are creating completely new textiles from fast-growing, carbon-sucking organisms such as micro- and macro-algae, mycelium (elements of fungus), bacteria and fermented yeast. These new biotechnologies efficiently convert sunlight and CO2 into mass raw materials, suck carbon out of the atmosphere and pave the way to a carbon-negative wardrobe", "description": "Many of our clothes are made from fossil-fuel-guzzling textiles but new leaps in biotechnology are paving the way to a carbon-negative wardrobe", "authors": ["Source", "Guardian Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82d57d096066734e45ae5c6a42be964d42a3419b/78_5_1791_1075/master/1791.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c86e8a270ac2562f3d1b738f7bbd8638", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
