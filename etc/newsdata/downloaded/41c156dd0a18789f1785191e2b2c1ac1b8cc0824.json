It ended up being a very tight game.\n\nWales boss Warren Gatland has offered his support to England ahead of the Rugby World Cup final (Ashley Western/PA)\n\n\u201cI thought England were excellent against the All Blacks \u2013 it was the best I\u2019ve seen England play in the last 10 years. I thought they were outstanding.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a great final with two physical teams, and I hope a northern hemisphere team can win the World Cup.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of players there who I\u2019ve been fortunate to have had personal contact with through the (British and Irish) Lions, and I want to wish them all the best.\u201d\n\nGatland, meanwhile, described England\u2019s response to the Haka before that game as \u201ccompletely respectful.\u201d\n\nEngland have been fined for advancing beyond the half-way line when confronting the Haka.\n\nCaptain Owen Farrell and his team-mates formed a V shape to face the Maori war dance, but several players at the tips of the formation strayed beyond the boundaries established under World Rugby regulations.\n\nThe fine, which the PA news agency understands is \u00a32,000, will be donated to the global governing body\u2019s official charity.\n\nNew Zealander Gatland added: \u201cWe haven\u2019t even spoken about the Haka. We might do a \u2018W\u2019 for Wales. It hasn\u2019t really crossed my mind.\n\nEngland were fined for encroaching on New Zealand\u00b4s half during the Haka (Adam Davy/PA)\n\n\u201cI think the way teams want to respond to the Haka is completely up to them. For them (England) to do something like that is completely respectful as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t turn their backs or anything like that. They stood there and received the Haka. I was just thankful England didn\u2019t do some Morris dancing!\n\n\u201cI thought that was a perfect response. You can respond in your own way, and they were accepting the challenge. That\u2019s what England did.\n\n\u201cThe Haka is about standing up and accepting the challenge because the Haka is challenging lots of things about you \u2013 how tough you are, how physical you are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important you don\u2019t take a backward step and you respond respectfully. I thought England did that.\u201d\n\nWales, meanwhile, have lost four players through injury for their game against New Zealand in Tokyo.\n\nFull-back Leigh Halfpenny (concussion), wing George North (hamstring), prop Tomas Francis (shoulder) and flanker Aaron Wainwright (hamstring) all miss out after starting the semi-final loss to South Africa.\n\nGatland has made nine changes for his final match in charge before stepping down, including starts for Cardiff Blues wing Owen Lane, Ospreys prop Nicky Smith and Scarlets flanker James Davies.\n\nWales' line-up for the Bronze Final at #RWCTokyo Naw newid am y g\u00eam olaf y prif hyfforddwr.\u200b#NZLvWAL pic.twitter.com/mR3Tp1kL8J \u2014 Welsh Rugby Union \ud83c\udfc9 (@WelshRugbyUnion) October 30, 2019\n\nHalfpenny had concussion issues last season, being sidelined for several weeks and missing a number of games for Wales and Scarlets.\n\nThe Welsh Rugby Union, meanwhile, said that Francis\u2019 shoulder injury will require ongoing assessment, while Gatland confirmed that ankle injury victim Liam Williams, who was hurt in training last week, had undergone surgery in the United Kingdom.\n\nGatland\u2019s reign ends after the All Blacks game, concluding a 12-year tenure highlighted by Wales winning four Six Nations titles, three Grand Slams and reaching two World Cup semi-finals.", "description": "Wales boss gets behind England as they prepare for the final against South Africa.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/06/wire-20362662-1572417261-747_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
