A stock like Jabil Inc. ( JBL ) might be boring, but it's a classic American company that is thriving, under the radar. Their customers span numerous industries, including health care, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, and networking and telecommunications.\n\nLet's check out the charts of JBL below.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of JBL, below, we can see a series of rallies and deep reactions. Each move up makes a new high but the pullbacks go too deep and would unnerve most traders. Notice the tests and breaks of the 200-day moving average line in March, June and August. The pattern looks different this month as prices have soared higher without the anticipated downward reaction. JBL is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the bullish 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line moved sideways from February but just made a new high for the move up telling us that buyers are more aggressive and the new high is confirmed by the volume. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has also moved up to a new bullish high.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of JBL, below, we can see that prices have broken out to a multi-year high. JBL is above the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is turning up to its own new high and the MACD oscillator is bullish on this longer time frame.\n\nWe added this monthly bar chart of JBL, below, to show the big picture on this upside breakout. Resistance is old and probably not going to be an issue.\n\nIn this weekly close only Point and Figure chart of JBL, below, we can see a potential upside price target in the $43 area.\n\nBottom-line strategy: JBL has made a major upside breakout. Use any dip or sideways price action to go long. Risk a close below $32. First target is the $43 area.", "description": "Under-the-Radar Jabil Is Showing a Major Long-Term Upside Breakout", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Under-The-Radar Jabil Is Showing A Major Long-Term Upside Breakout", "Jabil Might Be Boring", "But It'S A Classic American Company That Is Thriving.", "Alex Frew Mcmillan", "Bob Ciura", "Bret Jensen", "Bob Lang", "Peter Tchir", "Gary Berman"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/jabilcircuits-large.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
