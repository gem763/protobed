In another 15-minute phone call, she questions if Alexa still loves her. She asks Alexa to pick her up from the family she\u2019s staying with in New York. Alexa hears the girl say the words in Spanish: \u201cYou are my mom, I want to be with you.\u201d\n\nAlexa wishes she could go get her. But Alexa\u2019s locked up 2,400 miles away, at an immigration detention center in Arizona.\n\nAlexa, 23, and her six-year-old niece arrived at the US border from Guatemala in early 2019, after gang members murdered much of their family and Alexa was left as the sole caretaker of the little girl. It\u2019s been more than seven months since US officials on the Arizona border separated them. It\u2019s the longest they have ever been apart. Now they are in the hands of a system that won\u2019t make it easy for them to reunite.\n\nCall it a miracle: how strangers got two caravan families across the border Read more\n\nThe public outcry over forced family separations at the border last year has faded from the headlines, yet migrant families continue to be separated today. A federal judge in San Diego ordered the Trump administration in the summer of 2018 to reunite families and stop separating most parents and children. But the court order does not apply to non-parents, and the administration keeps separating people like Alexa \u2013 aunts, grandparents or older siblings who commonly step in as guardians without formal paperwork \u2013 from the children they\u2019re traveling with, without any procedure to reunite them. (The government also continues splitting up some children from their parents, citing reasons such as the parents\u2019 criminal history.)\n\nFigures obtained on Thursday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) through litigation reveal the federal government separated at least 1,556 more children from their parents than it had previously disclosed, bringing the number of known cases to more than 5,460. \u201cThe family separation practice was worse than we thought in the past and is still ongoing,\u201d says Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrant Rights Project. The overall tally would be larger still if it included families like Alexa and her niece, but no one has tracked the number of children separated from non-parent adult relatives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rally against Donald Trump\u2019s immigrant family separation policies in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 30 June 2018.

Her memories come at night, amid the screams of other detainees who plead to be released or beg for cigarettes. She wakes up feeling like someone is hunting her. She knows she\u2019s seen too much death.\n\nWhen we talk about family separation, we are not just talking about DNA families Anthony Enriquez\n\nAlexa, who did not want her real name or niece\u2019s name disclosed for fear of reprisal, told her story over a series of phone calls from the Eloy detention center, located 64 miles (103km) from Phoenix, Arizona. During a brief visit at the center, she spoke softly, without ever erasing her welcoming smile. A white rosary peeked out from underneath her dark green uniform.\n\nWhen Alexa thinks about her family she bows her head to cry. She says she was a teenager when gang members beat her mother to death in front of her in Guatemala over a longstanding land dispute. Two years later, in 2013, the gang returned and murdered her father and sister in the family\u2019s rural home. Alexa managed to flee and looked for help. When she returned home with the police, she found her dead sister\u2019s eight-month-old baby near death, choking in a pool of blood, her little legs bound. The baby was in shock and could not cry.\n\nAlexa, then 17, suddenly found herself the sole caregiver of her niece. \u201cEvery time she cried, I cried with her,\u201d she says. \u201cWe grew up together.\u201d\n\nShe worked cleaning jobs so she could buy the baby milk, she says. She went on to have a son of her own, but he fell ill and died suddenly at 22 months. In 2018, the gang that killed her family fatally shot her partner outside the couple\u2019s home. The gang shot at Alexa, too, and she fled with the girl, who was five by then.\n\nThe federal prosecutor\u2019s office in Guatemala told Alexa they couldn\u2019t help her because the men were too dangerous and advised her to leave the country, she recalls. After she made it to Mexico\u2019s northern border in early 2019, she resolved to apply for political asylum in the US, ruling out living in Mexico because of gangs and violence there. She didn\u2019t know that she could be separated from the girl when she started her journey. \u201cThe United States is the only country that can protect you,\u201d she says.\n\nAmerican volunteers at her migrant shelter in Mexico helped her obtain copies of the child\u2019s birth certificate and family death certificates, which prove her relatives were murdered. The volunteers also gave her a letter to carry, which stated she didn\u2019t agree to be separated from the child.\n\nShe assured the girl they would stay together, that in the US, everything would be better. But when they got to the Lukeville, Arizona, port of entry and she asked for asylum, she was told they would be split up and the girl would be sent to New York. It would take Alexa days before she understood that was a state thousands of miles away.\n\n\u201cThe girl was clinging to me,\u201d Alexa recalls, adding that a female customs officer ripped her from her arms nonetheless. Alexa remembers the girl\u2019s cries and the officer telling her to shut up. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this without my permission,\u201d Alexa recalls saying. \u201c\u2018Of course, I can,\u2019 she told me.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nChildren who arrive at the border without a parent or legal guardian \u2013 even if they come with an adult relative \u2013 are considered \u201cunaccompanied\u201d and are sent to child shelters, according to a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson. These protocols \u201censure the safety of the child\u201d, the spokesperson wrote in an e-mail. The government requires legal guardians to show adoption papers or a court order, neither of which Alexa has.\n\nBut some advocates say the government should broaden its definition of legal guardian to include longstanding adult caregivers. Michelle Bran\u00e9, director of migrant rights and justice at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, is disappointed the government has so far refused to take that step. \u201cBecause really the whole point of all of this is to do what\u2019s in the best interests of the child,\u201d Bran\u00e9 says.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Border patrol officers talk with a group of Central American asylum seekers before taking them into custody on 12 June 2018 near McAllen, Texas.

And under Trump, immigrants who ask for asylum at ports of entry are typically forced to remain in detention until their cases are resolved.\n\nAlexa spent 15 days without any news of what had happened to her child, until a psychologist at the detention center helped arrange for a phone call. The girl had been placed with a temporary foster family in New York City.\n\nVolunteers Alexa had met at the shelter in Mexico learned of her situation and rallied to help. They found her pro bono attorneys and requested the girl\u2019s case be overseen by an independent child advocate, a service available to some unaccompanied immigrant children in government custody. The child advocate got federal officials to allow Alexa and her niece to call twice a week.\n\nFor many other families like Alexa\u2019s, phone calls with children don\u2019t happen at all, says Weiss, the attorney. \u201cIf that person is not the biological parent or legal guardian, there is no guarantee of communication.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nAn immigration judge has found Alexa\u2019s case credible and acknowledged she suffered harm, but denied her case met the complex legal standard for asylum. Her attorney Suzannah Maclay has filed an intent to appeal but says the case could take over two years to reach a resolution, given the current backlog in cases and the Trump administration\u2019s constant changes to the immigration system. There is a chance, however, Alexa could be released from detention sooner through other legal motions.\n\nLike other separated caregivers, she\u2019s now facing dueling priorities: enduring detention long enough to defend herself from deportation back to danger, and reuniting with her child as quickly as possible \u2013 even when there is no clear path to do so.\n\nIn detention, most days resemble one another. She sleeps as much as she can. Her uniform makes her feel like a criminal. The food is always the same \u2013 \u201cpotatoes, potatoes and more potatoes\u201d. She is often sick to her stomach, and sometimes it is hard to distinguish whether it is the food or the anxiety of not knowing what will happen next.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A Mexican woman holds a doll next to children at the Paso del Norte port of entry at the US-Mexico border on 20 June 2018.

She has heard from the child advocate maybe the girl can be transferred to Arizona and they can have brief reunions in the detention visitor room. She is learning to read in English and Spanish, so she can understand her legal documents rather than just stare at them.\n\nIncreasingly, though, she thinks it\u2019s better to be deported than keep fighting in detention. Her heart aches for her child, and it\u2019s hard to accept that the girl she raised as a daughter now lives with strangers. \u201cWithout her I feel like everything is over,\u201d she says.\n\nI\u2019ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum Alexa\n\n\u201cI am desperate and depressed,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been locked up for a long time without having done anything, my only mistake was to ask for asylum.\u201d\n\nBut if she were to return to Guatemala, she knows she wouldn\u2019t be safe. \u201cThey are looking for me to kill me,\u201d she says. And she fears an American family will adopt the little girl if she were to return, though legal advocates say that rarely happens.\n\nIt\u2019s more likely if Alexa were to be deported, the child\u2019s advocate would arrange for the girl to also return to Guatemala \u2013 even though it could take months for her to follow. Alexa would probably have to board a plane alone, trusting the government and advocates to ensure her child would one day join her.\n\nIn the meantime, Alexa looks forward to those days when she talks to her girl. Sometimes they make small talk about the dolls the girl plays with, or the school she attends. Other times, she tells Alexa she has a magic wand that will make the distance between them disappear. There\u2019s not a call when the girl doesn\u2019t ask how much longer they will have to wait to be together. Alexa has to say it\u2019s all in the hands of a judge.\n\nIt\u2019s tough to explain to a six-year-old she protected all her life that she\u2019s now powerless. She\u2019s all the family Alexa has. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not willing to lose her,\u201d she says.", "description": "The Trump administration is still separating children from their family members at the border.
