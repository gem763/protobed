(AP Photo/Andy Manis)\n\nAnother week, another underwhelming performance from the Michigan State offense. And underwhelming is putting it lightly when describing what the Spartans put forth on Saturday against No. 8 Wisconsin.\n\nIn a 38-0 loss, MSU mustered only 149 yards, turned it over twice (including a Brian Lewerke interception that was returned for a touchdown), gained just seven first downs and was 2-of-14 on third down. It was ugly from the jump. MSU didn\u2019t even get a single first down until the second quarter. Meanwhile, Wisconsin drove it right down the defense\u2019s throat time and time again.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe loss dropped MSU\u2019s record to 4-3 (2-2 Big Ten) on the year. All three losses have come against teams that are currently ranked: Arizona State on Sept. 14 (a 10-7 home loss), Ohio State last Saturday (34-10 in Columbus) and Saturday\u2019s performance in Madison.\n\nIn those games, Michigan State has scored 17 points combined. That stat led to the following postgame question for Spartans head coach Mark Dantonio: \u201cSeven games in, was it a mistake to not bring in a new offensive staff?\u201d\n\nDantonio did not appreciate it.\n\nReporter: Was it a mistake not to bring in a new offensive staff?\n\n\n\nMark Dantonio was having none of it. pic.twitter.com/EeLaUNpSIL \u2014 Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) October 12, 2019\n\nFrankly, the question was perfectly reasonable after the performance put on by Dantonio\u2019s team. It was a performance reminiscent of many games in recent years from his team, in fact.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second half of the 2018 season was horrific for the Spartans on offense. The team averaged 12.2 points per game over its final seven contests, including four games with seven points or fewer. The line completely lacked physicality. The running backs had no explosiveness \u2014 or holes to run through. The receivers couldn\u2019t get open. Not exactly a recipe for success, right?\n\nYou figured Dantonio would make some changes, especially playing in a division with Ohio State, Penn State and Michigan. He did make changes \u2014 sort of. Instead of bringing in some fresh eyes to assess the situation, he simply shuffled the staff, moving each position coach to a new position and promoting Brad Salem up from quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator.\n\nTo nobody\u2019s surprise, it hasn\u2019t worked. And it\u2019s a decision that has set back Dantonio\u2019s program considerably. Even as the Michigan Wolverines sputter in Ann Arbor, Michigan State is the clear fourth-best team in the division. That solely lies on Dantonio\u2019s shoulders and he seems to be the only one who doesn\u2019t realize it.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Another week, another underwhelming performance from the Michigan State offense.", "authors": ["Sam Cooper"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/45H72lHcp4LUhUfiluwIww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ik8Gkc0kvuWAa7w.I7io8Q--~B/aD0yODI4O3c9NDI0MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/584c7060-ed4d-11e9-bedf-d21d4fe210ab", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
