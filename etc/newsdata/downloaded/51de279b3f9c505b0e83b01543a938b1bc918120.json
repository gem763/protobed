Even the most optimistic Blade wouldn't have imagined that after eight matches their team would have topped the statistics for clean sheets, goals conceded, goals conceded in open play and save percentage.\n\nOnly three sides had allowed their opponents fewer shots on goal.\n\nA lot of the credit has gone to Wilder, whose side travel to West Ham on Saturday, and rightly so.\n\nThe 52-year-old boyhood Sheffield United fan and former player has climbed the managerial ladder the hard way via Alfreton, Halifax and Northampton.\n\nThree Blades players crowd out Liverpool's Mohamed Salah during their game last month\n\nDefender Jack O'Connell ensures Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe has no room to manoeuvre\n\nMOST CLEAN SHEETS Premier League this season 5 -Manchester City 4 - Sheffield United 3 - Brighton, Burnley, Crystal Palace, Everton, Leicester, Newcastle, West Ham, Wolves\n\nTwo promotions in three seasons at Bramall Lane have sent his reputation soaring and left plenty of other supporters \u2013 including those at Arsenal \u2013 wishing he was at their club.\n\nIn some ways, Wilder fits the image of a straight-talking Yorkshireman.\n\n'This manager says how it is,' says George Baldock, a typical signing from MK Dons in 2017 who is now a Premier League regular.\n\n'He is an honest guy and speaks truth and never lies to you. If he is happy, he will tell you and if he is not, he will tell you too.'\n\nSometimes that might upset the sensitive. His reaction to goalkeeper Dean Henderson's blunder against Liverpool was tough love rather than cuddly sympathy.\n\n'It's a real tough sport and from my point of view I don't want him to make mistakes,' said Wilder. 'He has to cut that out because with all the top goalkeepers, the mistakes are few and far between.'\n\nWilder didn't spare the feeling of keeper Dean Henderson after his mistake against Liverpool\n\nGeorge Baldock tackles Arsenal's Sead Kolasinac during the Blades' win on Monday night\n\nDEFENSIVE STRENGTH Premier League 2019-20 Clean sheets: 4 Goals conceded: 8 Goals conceded per match: 0.8 Saves: 29 Tackles: 160 (65 per cent success) Interceptions: 152 Clearances: 289 (170 headed) Aerial battles/duels won: 775\n\nIf that looks harsh, Wilder's supporters will point to the spirit in the Blades dressing-room which is reckoned to be fantastic.\n\nBut there is far more to Wilder than being hard. If Sheffield United do survive in the Premier League on a tiny budget compared to rivals, it won't just be due to camaraderie.\n\nThere is a lot of thought and intelligence in their play. On Monday, they were the team with a plan whereas Arsenal were a mish-mash of 11 individuals.\n\nThe overlapping centre-halves are the most obvious embodiment of Wilder's nous.\n\nHe plays with a five-man defence but when United have good possession, the right-sided and left-sided central defenders are encouraged to get forward to join the wing-backs up the pitch. It is hard for opponents to cope with, a 5-3-2 seamlessly becomes an attacking 3-4-1-2.\n\nIndividually, the Blades defenders aren't household names. Baldock is right wing-back, right central defender Chris Basham was already at the club when Wilder joined in League One and O'Connell (left centre-half) signed from Brentford in his first transfer window.\n\nChris Basham (left) and John Egan celebrate Sheffield United's win over Arsenal\n\nPhil Jagielka has struggled for game time since returning to his first club over the summer\n\nSeason at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Egan, the one defender who holds his position in the middle, is another Brentford old boy while left wing-back Enda Stevens came from Portsmouth when they were in League Two.\n\nCollectively, they are a well-oiled machine, leaving former England international Jagielka to spend most of his time on the bench.\n\nAttack-wise, the flexibility in the system has obvious benefits. Against Palace, O'Connell and Stevens joined Luke Freeman down the left, giving them an overload that led to the winning goal.\n\nChelsea didn't know how to cope when centre-half Basham was more advanced than full-back Baldock and Blades came back from 2-0 down to win a point at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut the improvisation hasn't come at a defensive cost. Work-rate and organisation are so high, Blades are incredibly tough to break down when they defend as a five.\n\nLuke Freeman challenges Christian Pulisic during United's 2-2 draw at Chelsea in August\n\nLys Mousset, a \u00a310m summer arrival from Bournemouth, scored the winner against Arsenal\n\nCHRIS WILDER'S CV 2001\u20132002 Alfreton Town 2002\u20132008 Halifax Town 2008\u20132014 Oxford United 2014\u20132016 Northampton Town 2016\u2013 Sheffield United\n\nThe canny Wilder ensures his teams usually start matches very solidly and gradually get more expansive as the game develops - though they did start fast against Arsenal.\n\nIt is significant that United have conceded just once in the opening 35 minutes of games, to Tammy Abraham against Chelsea.\n\nThey are pragmatic when coming under pressure. But when they have the ball, Basham and O'Connell know when to get forward to add extra numbers. The forwards can then get into dangerous positions in the box.\n\nThe theory sounds simple but in practice it's tough to enact. Leeds United's super-coach Marcelo Bielsa has admitted he's been unable to make it work. 'I have seen very few people with these ideas,' said Bielsa in admiration of Wilder.\n\nWilder, seen here celebrating the Arsenal win, has drawn admirers for his tactical ideas\n\nThe Yorkshireman may be no-nonsense when he talks but shows fresh tactical thinking\n\nThe system made its debut in an away game at Gillingham in League One. In the lower leagues, Sheffield United were a big scalp and there was a clear benefit in pushing more defenders forward to break down packed defences.\n\nThe impressive aspect of this season's Sheffield United team is that Wilder has stuck with his system in the Premier League where the opposition are far better at keeping the ball themselves.\n\nOf course it's been tweaked and O'Connell and Basham don't venture as far forward in the opening quarter of games. But when they do, it's to great effect. Last season the pair managed six goals and seven assists between them.\n\nTo work, it takes not only discipline but also playmakers in midfield who can find their targets.\n\nThe Blades celebrates Premier League promotion in style at the end of last season\n\nFortunately, Sheffield United have a top-quality one in Oliver Norwood who starred for Northern Ireland at Euro 2016 but has now retired from international football to concentrate on his club.\n\nIt also takes belief that a collection of lower league players and journeyman can express themselves in the hardest league in the world.\n\nThat comes from Wilder who broke the club transfer record several times in the summer but has largely kept the new recruits on the bench and stayed loyal to the men who won promotion using his system.\n\n'Our philosophy, method and structure won't change,' he declared on the eve of the new Premier League season.\n\nMany thought him na\u00efve at the time, now they see him as a genius.", "description": "JOE BERNSTEIN: Far from living up to their billing as favourites for relegation, Sheffield United are currently in the top half  and boast one of the best defensive record in the division.", "authors": ["Joe Bernstein For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/11/20127518-0-image-a-85_1571914303507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
