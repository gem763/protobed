They have access to text messages that prove Sondland was in contact with his Ukrainian counterparts about the Bidens and the reports of quid pro quo on the part of the president, Schiff shared.\n\nThe State Department\u2019s decision to block Sondland from testifying, the chairman said, means the White House is \"taking actions to prevent us from protecting the nation\u2019s security.\"\n\nStill, Schiff said the panel will continue to investigate four specific items: Whether the president solicited foreign help from Ukraine, whether he sought a meeting with Ukraine to gauge their willingness to investigation the Bidens and the 2016 election, whether Ukraine was given reason to believe military aid was being withheld until it made commitments to Trump, and whether there was an effort by the president, secretary of state, or other administration officials \"to cover up this misconduct.\"\n\nRepublicans spoke to the press immediately after Schiff's presser, with a different take on the proceedings. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) said Republicans \"understand why\" the State Department stopped Sondland from testifying.\n\n\"It\u2019s a based on an unfair and partisan process Mr. Schiff has been running,\" Jordan said.\n\nThe Republican repeated the report that Schiff didn\u2019t even tell his fellow panel members that he had met with the whistleblower before the complaint was published.\n\n\"We were actually looking forward to hearing\" from Sondland, Jordan said. \"But unfortunately, the chairman is so biased that he wouldn\u2019t even tell us he met with whistleblower prior to the complaint.\"\n\nJordan added that they were not about to subject Ambassador Sondland to the same treatment former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker experienced from the Democrats on the panel during his own deposition.\n\nPresident Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday that he too doesn't want to see Sondland enter that \"kangaroo court.\"", "description": ".10/08/2019 10:57:27AM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/262/f7b3eaf1-9ba7-4bb6-8ecd-854d926df582.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
