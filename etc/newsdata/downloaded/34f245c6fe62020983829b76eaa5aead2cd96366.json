There\u2019s a lot there, and some of the information has since been corrected or clarified, so here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nThere\u2019s Autosave, But You Can Turn It Off\n\nTraditionally, you\u2019ve had to manually save in the Pok\u00e9mon series. In a way, it\u2019s a boon, because it allows fastidious players to, say, obsessively hunt for shiny Pok\u00e9mon or save scum an encounter with a legendary Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nWhile eagle-eyed players noticed a \u201cnow saving\u201d icon during a Pok\u00e9mon Nintendo Direct in early September, Game Freak has now confirmed the existence of an autosave function, and has assured players you can turn it off.\n\n\u201cTraditionally in Pok\u00e9mon games, it\u2019s an important thing to write your report to record your save, and that\u2019s always been a staple, like, \u201cRemember to save your game!\u201d We do have an autosave feature this time, where you can just adventure and it\u2019ll constantly save the game,\u201d Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori told Game Informer. The article goes on to say that the feature is optional, so shiny hunting is still a viable pastime for players so inclined.\n\nYes, The Pok\u00e9mon Cut From Sword and Shield Will Show Up In Future Games\n\nAlthough the lack of a National Pok\u00e9Dex containing every Pok\u00e9mon in existence is still a sore spot for fans, don\u2019t worry too much. You\u2019ll see all your friends again.\n\nPok\u00e9mon producer Junichi Masuda told Game Informer that these cut Pok\u00e9mon will come back for future games. \u201cYou can look forward to seeing Pok\u00e9mon that don\u2019t appear in these games appearing in different regions in future games,\u201d he said.\n\nMasuda said that the decision to cut Pok\u00e9mon from Sword and Shield came down to wanting to focus on new gameplay mechanics. \u201cWe want to continue to come up with these new features, so we figured this was the best path forward for the franchise,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you were hoping on a hint for which Pok\u00e9mon were cut and how many, you\u2019re out of luck. Masuda did say that it came down to what creatures would be most likely to live in the Galar region, which is based on the United Kingdom.\n\n\u201cWe really spent a lot of effort deciding which would best fit the setting of the adventure and the features that we wanted to implement. I think players will be satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s quite a few Pok\u00e9mon that you\u2019ll encounter in the Galar region Pok\u00e9dex, so I think players will have fun seeing all the Pok\u00e9mon.\u201d\n\nPok\u00e9mon Gain Experience Automatically\n\nOne of the quality of life improvements I\u2019ve always liked in the later Pok\u00e9mon games is Experience Share. In earlier games, if I wanted my Pok\u00e9mon to level up evenly, I\u2019d have to create a system where I switched whatever Pok\u00e9mon I wanted to get experience to the front of my party, then switch them out as the battle actually started.\n\nUnfortunately, that put me at a disadvantage, allowing my opponent to get the first shot in. There was the first generation\u2019s EXP All item, but it split experience evenly between Pok\u00e9mon in a way that made it essentially useless.\n\nNewer games introduced the EXP Share, an item that allowed Pok\u00e9mon to all receive experience even if they didn\u2019t battle. That item doesn\u2019t exist in Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield, but your Pok\u00e9mon will still all gain experience equally throughout your adventure, Sword and Shield director Shigeru Ohmori told Game Informer.\n\nGame Freak Wants To Make All Pok\u00e9mon More Competitive\n\nPok\u00e9mon planning director Kazumasa Iwao was cagey on the details, but it seems that Game Freak is trying to address a longtime problem with the Pok\u00e9mon series: Sometimes the Pok\u00e9mon that you like the most just aren\u2019t viable in battle.\n\nA lot of the time, players go out and find their first Pok\u00e9mon, fall in love with them, and then find that they just can\u2019t hack it on the battlefield, Iwao told Game Informer.\n\n\u201cThis time around, we really wanted to introduce some systems that help the player be able to take those Pok\u00e9mon they caught in the beginning, and the first one they chose, and actually take them straight into competitive battle,\u201d Iwao continued.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hidden parameters to Pok\u00e9mon that aren\u2019t surfaced to the player. We\u2019re doing a lot of stuff in the back end introducing systems that allow players to make sure that Pok\u00e9mon they want to use in competitive battles are viable.\u201d\n\nIwao doesn\u2019t get more specific than that, but did say that players will know what he\u2019s talking about when they see it.\n\nNo, There Aren\u2019t 18 Gyms\n\nThis rumour persisted thanks to a slightly mistranslated quote. Initially, Game Informer reported in a sidebar to their cover story on Pok\u00e9mon that Sword and Shield would have 18 gyms, which is more than double the normal amount of gyms.\n\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company International reached out to clarify that no, there won\u2019t be such an astronomical amount of gyms in a single playthrough, but there are more gyms than normal in the game\u2019s canon.\n\nIn the Galar region, Pok\u00e9mon gyms are divided up into a minor and major league, following the theme of Sword and Shield\u2019s exploration of the UK\u2019s sports culture. Which gyms appear in the minor league and major league will change depending on the version of the game you buy.\n\n\u201cOver the course of the main story, Trainers will challenge eight Gyms, which are all in the Major League. Which Gyms appear in the Major League and Minor League will differ between Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Pok\u00e9mon Shield,\u201d The Pok\u00e9mon Company International told Game Informer. \u201cFor example, depending on the version of the game, Trainers will be able to challenge different Gym Leaders, such as Bea or Allister.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a little bit more interesting than just having a gruelling gym gauntlet. I\u2019ll have to fight temptation to get both versions just to see what all the major league gyms look like.", "description": "This week, Game Informer had a slew of interviews with the leads of the Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield team at Game Freak.
