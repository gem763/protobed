The deal came about in large part due to customer demand, Brad Armstrong, Slack VP of Business and Corporate Development, told Business Insider.\n\n\"It's really about the increasing demand from our customers and meeting what they want to see in terms of collaboration between them,\" Armstong said. \"So for both of us, we're pleasing our customers by doing this.\"\n\nThe new features are aimed at helping customers more efficiently collaborate across both tools \u2014 it means that Slack's 12 million monthly active users can search for and share Salesforce customer records without leaving the chat app. It also means that conversations on Slack can be appended directly to Salesforce.\n\nArmstrong said that sales and service professionals \u2014 Salesforce's core customer demographic \u2014 are a growing part of Slack's user base, which makes these kinds of integrations valuable to them. These updates apply to Slack's existing integration with Salesforce Sales Cloud, its flagship customer relationship management (CRM) product. It will include Salesforce's Service Cloud, for customer support and other frontline workers, as well.\n\nThe new integrations allow users to append a Slack conversation directly to a Salesforce record. Slack\n\nSlack and Salesforce first partnered up three years ago, to offer basic collaboration to customers using both tools. Armstrong said in those three years the partnership has grown tremendously.\n\n\"We have a much better understanding of what customers want between these systems and how they want to interact with them than we did before, and then the product engagement has grown,\" Armstrong said.\n\nSalesforce's Ryan Aytay, Executive VP of Strategic Partnerships and Quip co-CEO, echoed those comments in a blog post. \"This tighter integration between Salesforce and Slack is a key way for us to dramatically streamline how our joint customers work,\" Aytay said. Both Slack and Salesforce now have product teams that talk to customers and each other and build roadmaps to keep growing the partnership. \"We're working a lot more closely now to present these integrations to our joint customers and new customers by going to market together,\" Armstrong said.\n\nAs previous Salesforce executive, Armstrong said his previous knowledge of the company and its workflow helped this partnership thrive. He said that Salesforce is very forward-looking as a partner.\n\nWhen working with larger enterprise software vendors, Armstrong said they try to learn as much as possible from the companies, to understand how to best collaborate. Slack, to Armstrong's mind, represents a new way for colleagues and coworkers to talk to each other, and Salesforce has been ahead of the curve in adapting to this new reality.\n\n\"They know customers really well and we in these partnerships try to learn as much as possible and to really bring our point of view there because were representing a new way of working and a new paradigm, and there's compromises along the way,\" he said.", "description": "Brad Armstrong, Slack's VP of Business and Corporate Development, says that customers are using it right alongside Salesforce.", "authors": ["Paayal Zaveri"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d0b7e82e3ecba43cd660d47?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
