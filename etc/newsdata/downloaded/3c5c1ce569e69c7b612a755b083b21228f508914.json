They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.\n\nThere are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.\n\nThis kind of index follows this same mindset, as it attempts to pick stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance; non-cap weighted strategies base selection on certain fundamental characteristics, or a mix of such characteristics.\n\nThis area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.\n\nFund Sponsor & Index\n\nBecause the fund has amassed over $281.81 M, this makes it one of the average sized ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Value. DVP is managed by Deep Value Etf. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the TWM Deep Value Index before fees and expenses.\n\nTWM Deep Value Index is constructed using an objective, rules-based methodology that begins with an initial universe that mirrors the companies listed on the S&P 500 Index.\n\nCost & Other Expenses\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.\n\nOperating expenses on an annual basis are 0.80% for DVP, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.\n\nThe fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.74%.\n\nSector Exposure and Top Holdings\n\nWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.\n\nDVP's heaviest allocation is in the Consumer Discretionary sector, which is about 28.90% of the portfolio. Its Information Technology and Telecom round out the top three.\n\nWhen you look at individual holdings, Western Digital Corp (WDC) accounts for about 9.22% of the fund's total assets, followed by Viacom Inc New (VIAB) and Cvs Health Corp (CVS).\n\nDVP's top 10 holdings account for about 60.58% of its total assets under management.\n\nPerformance and Risk\n\nThe ETF has added about 0.91% and is down about -12.90% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/06/2019), respectively. DVP has traded between $27.93 and $35.71 during this last 52-week period.\n\nDVP has a beta of 1.17 and standard deviation of 17.90% for the trailing three-year period, which makes the fund a high risk choice in the space. With about 21 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.\n\nAlternatives\n\nDeep Value ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.\n\nIShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) tracks Russell 1000 Value Index and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) tracks CRSP U.S. Large Cap Value Index. IShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $38.69 B in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $48.65 B. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.19% and VTV charges 0.04%.\n\nInvestors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Value.\n\nBottom Line\n\nTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
