And they didn\u2019t, much, until the opposition was barred from taking part. That move, by the central election commission, sparked a movement which saw thousands turn out in the Russian capital in weeks of demonstrations last month.\n\nOn Sunday, after the largest protests that the capital has seen since 2011-12, Muscovites will finally go to the polls. But the fallout from the contested vote is likely to be just as bitter as the run-up. Friends of Konstantin Kotov, a political activist, chanted and wept in a courthouse last Thursday as he was jailed for four years. His crime was merely having attended five unsanctioned rallies, a violation that used to merit an administrative charge at most.\n\nKotov was the fourth person given time in prison as Russian investigators speedily wrapped up an investigation into rioting dubbed the \u201cMoscow case\u201d. Thousands have been detained in weeks of protests. Riot police wore balaclavas because of facial recognition software. Russia\u2019s elections head, Ella Pamfilova, was reportedly attacked at home with an electric shock gun days before the polls.\n\nIf this is what a city council election looks like, it could portend trouble in 2021, when the embattled ruling party, United Russia, tries to hang on to its overwhelming majority in nationwide parliamentary elections. As Sergei Medvedev, a professor of political science at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow put it, the government and opposition are \u201con a collision course\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe levels of repression and civil resistance are going to rise, and I think that\u2019s the likely scenario in the coming political seasons,\u201d said Medvedev. \u201cI don\u2019t see any radical changes\u2026 I see both sides continually raising the stakes.\u201d\n\nThe story behind the recent Moscow demonstrations is not just one of opposition initiative, but also of government fragility. Citing sources close to the Kremlin and city hall, the Russian media startup Proekt reported that a decision had been made to eliminate independent candidates because they were slated to win nine of 45 Moscow districts and that successes in the capital would help position the opposition going into 2021. Not one of the pro-government candidates ran in affiliation with United Russia, the ruling party allied with President Vladimir Putin, which has seen its ratings fall to a historically low 32% this summer.\n\nPutin has largely avoided talking about the demonstrations, but has accused opposition candidates of falsifying signatures and said that protests by the gilet jaunes in France were larger. Dmitry Peskov, his spokesman, has said that the Russian protests were not a \u201cpolitical crisis\u201d.\n\nBut to activists the arrests and criminal cases have indicated the level of official concern over the latest round of protests.\n\n\u201cThe government has shown it does not know how to react,\u201d said Lyubov Sobol, a protest leader, when asked about the future potential for demonstrations. \u201cNobody knows for certain what will happen in 2021, what the country will look like. But if the troubles with the economy continue, then we would see greater discontent, and that would mean a broader cross-section of the population taking part.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A campaign banner of a candidate in the Moscow city elections.

Maria Menshikova, an activist and editor of the student media outlet Doxa, said that after the elections efforts will focus on helping students who have been arrested or fined during the demonstrations. \u201cWe still have political prisoners,\u201d she said.\n\nStudent organisers are also focused on asserting political independence at universities such as the Higher School of Economics, considered one of Russia\u2019s most liberal elite universities.\n\nFor many students, this has been their first experience of collective protest. Fewer have thought forward to the elections in 2021, said Menshikova. \u201cFor someone who\u2019s 18 years old, thinking about 2021 is like thinking 100 years forward in time,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd despite having earned a reputation for aggressive action, students are also worried about what the backlash could mean for their safety and their academic careers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re called fearless, but I want to make very clear that we do feel fear about what could happen to us,\u201d said Nikita, a Higher School of Economics student, who did not give a surname.\n\nNobody is predicting a revolution and in a city of 10 million the numbers at the recent protests are moderate. But Lev Gudkov, head of the independent pollster Levada Centre, predicted that pro-government lawmakers would face increasing pressure in the run-up to 2021 and may seek to distance themselves from a failing United Russia party.\n\n\u201cThe protests are not going anywhere, they will reignite from time to time,\u201d he said, noting increasing concerns about the economy.\n\nThere\u2019s been a recent hike in the pension age by five years for all Russians and incomes have remained static over the past few years, meaning that even as the economy improves many Russians have still not felt the benefits.\n\nThe way to counter United Russia\u2019s broad lack of popularity would require a creative \u201cuse of administrative resource\u201d, Gudkov said, referring to the term usually used for boosting turnout from pro-government voters, including those working in government jobs.\n\nRigged results in the coming elections could elicit more demonstrations in 2021, he said, \u201cbut the government will put it down. There were 60,000 people [at the protest], but there\u2019s been no change. And Putin has pretended that he saw nothing.\u201d", "description": "Opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed in the run-up to city elections but activists are plotting the endgame: the overthrow of Russia\u2019s president", "authors": ["Andrew Roth"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a027fc8a79fc39d792dff7cf7d7d9500be773f5c/0_266_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7a0162f8b981a779c5500fe800000680", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
