That is the motto of congressional Democrats when it comes to getting President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpSessions says he still supports Trump despite ouster as AG House Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging Giuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info: report MORE.\n\nThey want to make him a one-term president \u2014 and if they can find a way to force him out of office before the 2020 election, all the better.\n\nImpeaching Trump has been the Democrats\u2019 monomania ever since they took control of the House of Representatives following the 2018 midterms. They thought they could get Trump on Russian collusion, and they also eyed an opportunity to impeach Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh Brett Michael KavanaughDemocrats cry wolf on Trump-Ukraine During impeachment storm, senators cross aisle to lessen mass incarceration Embracing President Mike Pence might be GOP's best play MORE just for good measure.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNeither approach proved to be very fruitful. After more than two years of screaming bloody murder about Trump being a puppet of Vladimir Putin Vladimir Vladimirovich PutinPutin says he doesn't share 'excitement' about Greta Thunberg's UN speech The Hill's 12:30 Report: Trump lashes out over impeachment inquiry Putin jokes about Russia meddling in 2020 election: 'Don't tell anyone' MORE, the Muller report proved to be a complete dud; and the effort to smear Kavanaugh a second time as a means to further undermine the president has petered out. This on top of the scores of other inquiries House Democrats have feverishly plotted, digging into nearly every aspect of Trump\u2019s private and political life.\n\nUndaunted by their past misfires, congressional Democrats now think they have found Willy Wonka\u2019s golden ticket with Trump-Ukraine.\n\nIn their latest attempt to undo the 2016 presidential election simply because they despise the current occupant of the Oval Office, it is Democrats\u2019 general contention that Trump sought to pressure Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 election by looking into shady Biden family dealings and then sought to cover it up.\n\nFurther, congressional Democrats are so sure they have Trump\u2019s number this go-round that they intend to move with lightning speed on impeachment, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiHouse Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging Overnight Health Care: Judge rules supervised drug injection sites are legal | Is a drug pricing deal still possible? | Walmart latest retailer to pull Zantac from shelves McCarthy shares 'Stranger Things' parody video criticizing impeachment MORE (D-Calif.) has tapped House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffHouse Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging New York Times reporter fact-checks McCarthy on whistleblower claims Republicans seize on reports of whistleblower consulting with Intel Committee MORE (D-Calif.) to lead the charge for now. Schiff is the Democrats\u2019 go-to carnival barker when it comes to spreading copious amounts of disinformation. The media hangs on Schiff\u2019s every word and rarely questions his motives \u2014 even after he infamously said there was \u201cample evidence of collusion in plain sight\u201d between Trump and Russia.\n\nOne could certainly argue that Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky was ham-handed and ill-advised \u2014 but to claim it\u2019s illegal and thus warrants a fast-tracked impeachment seems like wishful thinking, and is an enormous political gamble.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLegally speaking, there does not appear to be any promises or threats or any kind of quid pro quo on Trump\u2019s part. Further, the Ukrainians weren\u2019t even aware that U.S. military aid was being held up at the time. As for campaign finance violations, the Department of Justice has already thrown cold water on that. Further, if Trump is engaged in a cover-up, he\u2019s doing a terrible job of it by taking the unprecedented step of making not only the call public, but also the whistleblower complaint. For those who want to delve into allegations of secret servers, Trump\u2019s predecessors have engaged in similar actions.\n\nWhat should give the American public and some Democrats great pause is that the process for whistleblowers who wish to have their concerns expedited to Congress might have been altered to allow secondhand and even thirdhand information to suffice. Further, the whistleblower complaint reads more like a premeditated political set-up from a leaker than the misgivings of a concerned citizen worried about potential White House wrongdoings. But the real kicker, if you want to be cynical, is that Democrats are accusing Trump of engaging in the very same activity with Ukraine in which they were involved in 2016 and again in 2018.\n\nNo one knows how this will ultimately pan out. There are significant political risks for both parties. But here\u2019s what we do know.\n\nSen.

She is currently surging in the Democratic presidential polls, and she gets to scream at Trump while defending her primary opponent Joe Biden Joe BidenHouse Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging Giuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info: report Top Pence adviser was on Trump-Zelensky phone call at center of whistleblower complaint: report MORE to the teeth, yet privately hoping this ordeal sinks Biden and Trump as well.\n\nWhen all is said and done, if persuadable voters (independents, swing-state voters) see this as nothing more than congressional Democrats crying wolf for the umpteenth time, engaging in a partisan exercise to appease a rabid base who refuses to accept Trump as a legitimate president, then Trump will be reelected in 2020. Further still, the House could come into play as well, when it wasn\u2019t before this gambit.\n\nThis is a high-risk game Democrats are playing, and they\u2019re going all-in to take out Trump.\n\nFord O'Connell served as director of rural outreach for John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign; he runs a political consulting business, is an adjunct professor at The George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, and is a regular commentator on FOX Business.
