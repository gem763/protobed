It also contains clues as to its future direction of travel.\n\nOn Monday, Thomas Cook announced that it had entered compulsory liquidation after failing to strike a \u00a31.1 billion ($1.4 billion) rescue deal with investors and creditors. The move put 21,000 jobs at risk and stranded up to 600,000 vacationers. The company\u2019s stock had already plunged 90% this year.\n\nThere aren\u2019t many companies left that run everything from strip-mall travel agencies to airlines, cruise ships and hotels, as the gains from coordinating flight and room bookings have turned out to be much lower than expected. Thomas Cook was eventually cornered by the rising cash demands of servicing a \u00a31.8 billion debt pile while doubts for its future sapped sales. Its only comparable rival, TUI , is holding up much better, and its stock rose 7% Monday.\n\nThe two companies\u2019 diverging journeys point to trends still unfolding in the travel industry.\n\nThomas Cook entered liquidation on Monday.

In the U.S., there are now 79,000 travel agents in employment, compared with 85,000 12 years ago, according to official data. Roughly half of all U.S. travel is still booked offline, according to industry research firm Phocuswright, allowing traditional package holidays to ride on the coattails of the recent travel boom.\n\nHowever, something fundamental did change: brand power. Before the rise of online booking\u2014let alone when Thomas Cook was born in 1841\u2014travelers relied on the tour operator brand not just for simplicity and peace of mind, but also to ensure a certain level of quality when staying in unknown countries.\n\nNow this is only a necessity in trips that are complex to book or demand a certain level of luxury, shifting power to the big international hotel chains.\n\nEven as many independent hotels buckle under the pressure of the booking websites and flat-sharing platform Airbnb, chains like Marriott, Hilton and InterContinental\u2014and to a lesser extent Hyatt and Accor\u2014are reaping large benefits from scaling up their brands, often through franchise agreements. In Europe, 40% of hotels are now under big brands, compared with 30% a decade ago, according to consulting firm HVS.\n\nThe taste for branded luxury travel has also buoyed cruise operators. This business tends to have very high margins, partly due to bottlenecks in the German and Italian shipyards that build most of the ships.\n\nUnlike Thomas Cook, TUI identified these trends and focused on directly owning luxury hotels and cruise ships. Cruises accounted for 28% of its operating profit last year, despite contributing less than 5% of the revenue.\n\nTUI\u2019s future isn\u2019t a certain one, though, even without competition from its main rival. Small travel agents may be surviving, but TUI is the last big company trying to keep the power of a package-tourism brand alive. And that ship may already have sailed.\n\nWrite to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nBritish tour operator Thomas Cook announced it entered compulsory liquidation after failing to strike a \u00a31.1 billion, or $1.4 billion, rescue deal with investors and creditors.
