What\u2019s Next for the Industry.", "language": "en", "text": "Text size\n\nAs the litigation seeking to hold corporations responsible for the opioid crisis rolls slowly through the legal system, one thing is changing quickly: the rate at which U.S. doctors prescribe opioids.\n\nThe number of prescribed opioids fell 17% in 2018, according to IQVIA, a health-care consulting and outsourcing group that tracks prescribing trends, and is down 43% since prescriptions peaked in 2010.\n\nStill, the pain that opioids were prescribed to treat isn\u2019t going away. Investors are looking to what\u2019s next in pain management.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of some of the big ideas:\n\nSafer opioids\n\nOne option: opioids, but safer. Collegium Pharmaceutical (ticker: COLL) sells an extended release oxycodone pill called Xtampza ER that maintains its extended release properties even when crushed, which makes it more difficult to abuse.\n\nIn a note in August, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brandon Folkes wrote that he expects Xtampza to be \u201cthe leading branded extended-release oxycodone over time.\u201d The company said in its second-quarter earnings report that the number of Xtampza ER prescriptions in the second quarter of 2019 rose 51% from the quarter a year earlier.\n\nBioDelivery Sciences International (BDSI) sells an opioid called Belbuca. It contains buprenorphine, which regulators consider less risky and less abuse-prone than oxycodone.\n\nStill, some investors are wary. With world is moving away from opioids, do you really want to be investing in a shrinking market?\n\nNon-Opioid Pain Treatments\n\nThe development of non-opioid pain medications has been challenging. In a June note, Folkes wrote that while nearly 10% of experimental drugs in Phase 1 clinical trials are eventually approved, the success rate is just 2% for new pain drugs.\n\n\u201cA new non-opioid molecule, with sufficient analgesia to target a general pain label, would be a significant product,\u201d Folkes wrote.\n\nThere are some opportunities on the horizon, though it is unclear if any could be a game-changer.\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is developing what are called NaV1.8 inhibitors, a type of sodium channel blocker, to treat pain. It has run three Phase 2 studies for its lead drug, called VX-150, which remains in development.\n\nThe Australian biotech company Mesoblast (MSB. Australia) is in Phase 3 trials on a cell therapy treatment for chronic low back pain caused by disc degeneration, and recently signed a commercialization deal with the private German company Gr\u00fcnenthal for the drug.\n\nSurgery\n\nAbbott Laboratories (ABT) has developed an implanted medical device that offers pain relief through something called spinal cord stimulation. The device, the Proclaim Elite Recharge-Free SCS System, can disrupt lower back and leg pain using what Abbott calls BurstDR stimulation.\n\nThe device, which the company compares to a pacemaker, sends pulses that \u201cmodify the pain signals as they travel to different parts of the brain,\u201d according to the company, which \u201cchange the way your body perceives pain.\u201d\n\nThe device is indicated for use in helping manage \u201cchronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs.\u201d\n\nWhile the device is an implant that must be installed with surgery, the company also offers a temporary system that can be used to test whether spinal cord stimulation works for the individual patient before they undergo surgery.\n\nRead More: How Opioid Lawsuits Could Hurt Investors\n\nWrite to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com", "description": "What\u2019s next in pain management?
