She spends the most money on travel, which adds up to over $12,000 a year.\n\nFor Business Insider's \"Real Money\" series, she tracked her spending for a week as she spent several days in Costa Rica and then traveled back to the US to visit family.\n\nWant to share a week of your spending? Email yourmoney@businessinsider.com.\n\nI recently watched a talk from one of the internet's favorite financial gurus, Ramit Sethi, and he kept repeating this one line: Spend extravagantly on the things you love, and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don't. This line is a pretty apt description of my money philosophy and how I make my unconventional lifestyle work.\n\nI'm just going to come out and say it: I spend, on average, more than $1,000 per month on travel. My travel spending adds up to $12,000 per year even though I spend about $36,000 per year in total. Now, let me rewind and explain.\n\nFour years ago I lived up to the ultimate millennial expectation: I saved up $5,000 and quit my job to travel. I traveled around Central America and volunteered on a ranch in Costa Rica in exchange for Spanish lessons. I fell in love with the small town I stayed in, and then with a man I met, and decided that I really wanted to stay.\n\nUnfortunately, my bank account disagreed. It was almost empty at this point. I'd learned a lot while traveling about various remote work opportunities and met people who were traveling the world while working online, so I opened up an account on popular freelancer website PeoplePerHour.com.\n\nI picked up low-paying gigs here and there but struggled financially for my first year. Living in a low-cost area was the only way I was able to make it work. I built up a career as a freelance financial writer, also offering content marketing and strategy consulting services. By the second year, I was up to the $40,000 salary I had at my previous job. By the third year, I almost doubled my previous salary.\n\nIn 2019, which will be my fourth year living abroad, I expect to make around $85,000 \u2014 a salary I never would have dreamt of while working in a traditional full-time job. My goal for 2020 is to breach six figures.\n\nI try to be careful with my money but I also don't like to deprive myself of meaningful experiences ... or delicious food. While travel is the biggest category on my budget, I don't spend anywhere near what most people would assume I do on it given how often I'm traveling. Credit card perks and rewards help a lot in that area, but so does traveling to low-cost areas, staying with family and friends, and knowing how to find fun, low-cost activities and budget eats.\n\nI don't consider myself to be particularly frugal. I live my life to the fullest. But by being strategic with my money \u2014 by spending generously on the things that really matter while cutting down extremely on things that don't measurably improve my life \u2014 I'm able to live what feels like a very full life while still saving money.", "description": "For\u00a0Business Insider's \"Real Money\" series, writer Elizabeth Aldrich tracked her spending during a week split between Costa Rica and the US.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Aldrich"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da899434af9095fc23a6df9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
