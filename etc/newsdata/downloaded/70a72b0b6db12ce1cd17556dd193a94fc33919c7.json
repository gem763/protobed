Yes, sure, we\u2019re going to do that. Don\u2019t tell anybody.\u2019\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday appeared to revel in the ongoing political maelstrom in the U.S., jokingly admitting to plans for future election meddling.\n\nWhen asked if Russia would interfere in the 2020 election cycle, Putin leaned into the microphone on stage and mimicked a whisper: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a secret. Yes, sure, we\u2019re going to do that. Don\u2019t tell anybody.\u201d\n\nThe quip at the Russia Energy Week panel elicited laughter and applause as Putin continued to discuss why he believes the allegations made by special counsel Robert Mueller, who concluded that Moscow mounted an aggressive effort to disrupt the 2016 presidential election, were untrue.\n\n\u201cThe fact that myself and Mr. Trump have a close relationship doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s in any way affecting the current political environment within the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see that (the United States) is trying to use any pretext to attack Mr. Trump, and now they\u2019re even trying to use Ukraine.\u201d\n\nHe maintained that while he has a good relationship with Trump \u201cbuilt on trust,\u201d Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election, citing focus on issues within his own country.\n\n\u201cWe have our own problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe invest immense resources into implementing our own goals in our own country. Why would we interfere anywhere?\u201d", "description": "\u2018I\u2019m going to tell you a secret. Yes, sure, we\u2019re going to do that.
