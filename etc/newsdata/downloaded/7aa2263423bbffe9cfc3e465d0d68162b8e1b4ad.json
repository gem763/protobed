(Variety previously reported on Daydream's discontinuation.)\n\nSmartphone-powered virtual reality always felt lacking compared to more fully fledged, dedicated virtual reality hardware \u2014 a contrast only heightened since the launch of Facebook's Oculus Quest headset, an all-in-one VR device that can track users' locations in three-dimensional space and requires no external hardware.\n\nDaydream, and other phone-powered headsets like it, featured far less sophisticated functionality, and its discontinuation is an explicit acknowledgement from Google that consumers failed to warm to the budget format.\n\nDespite billions of dollars of investments from big tech firms, in 2019 virtual reality is still struggling to break into the mainstream, and for most remains a novelty rather than a mature entertainment platform. Smartphone-based VR was an attempt to introduce the tech to the masses for the first time in a relatively low-cost way \u2014 but in retrospect will be viewed as an abortive stopgap on a sluggish path towards mainstream appeal.\n\nThe Daydream app will continue to be available for existing users, Google said, but it is no longer selling the Daydream View \u2014 the official headset \u2014 and the new Pixel 4 is not compatible with the tech. The spokesperson confirmed that the discontinuation of Daydream also includes third-party, standalone headsets that were powered by the underlying tech like the Lenovo Mirage.\n\nHere's Google's full statement:\n\n\"We saw a lot of potential in smartphone VR\u2014being able to use the smartphone you carry with you everywhere to power an immersive on-the-go experience. But over time we noticed some clear limitations constraining smartphone VR from being a viable long-term solution. Most notably, asking people to put their phone in a headset and lose access to the apps they use throughout the day causes immense friction.\n\n\"There also hasn't been the broad consumer or developer adoption we had hoped, and we've seen decreasing usage over time of the Daydream View headset. While we are no longer selling Daydream View or supporting Daydream on Pixel 4, the Daydream app and store will remain available for existing users.\n\n\"We're investing heavily in helpful AR experiences like Google Lens, AR walking navigation in Maps, and AR in Search that use the smartphone camera to bridge the digital and physical worlds, helping people do more with what they see and learn about the world around them.\"", "description": "Virtual reality is still struggling to go mainstream, and Google is throwing in the towel.", "authors": ["Rob Price"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da6e55ccc4a0a11614baec2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
