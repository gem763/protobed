That\u2019s only half the story.\n\nSo let\u2019s try it this way. Trump is not merely staking out an absolute refusal to cooperate with any and all lawful subpoenas, on the deeply absurd grounds that the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry is illegitimate, as the White House counsel has argued.\n\nAD\n\nRather, Trump is adopting that stance while simultaneously claiming the absolute right to bend large swaths of the government toward his goal of rigging the next election on his own behalf. Thus, Trump is declaring absolute authority to use extraordinarily corrupt means to avoid facing a fair election next year, while also declaring total immunity to any and all congressional efforts to prevent him from rigging that election, or even to hold him accountable for it.\n\nAD\n\nThe upshot of this, then, must be that Trump\u2019s explicitly declared position is that he is constrained by no existing legitimate mechanism of accountability.\n\nTrump\u2019s next moves in the coverup\n\nNow the New York Times reports that Trump and the administration will likely take new steps to prevent testimony from an enormously important witness: William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nThe texts released by Democrats show that Taylor twice objected to a direct quid pro quo in which Trump held up hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to extort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into helping him corrupt the 2020 election on his behalf.\n\nTrump and his consiglieri have undertaken a long-running plot to press Zelensky to undertake \u201cinvestigations\u201d to magically produce \u201cevidence\u201d validating a conspiracy theory undercutting the confirmed fact that Russia sabotaged the 2016 election to help Trump, and bolstering a fabricated narrative about invented corruption on the part of potential campaign opponent Joe Biden.\n\nAD\n\nTaylor could speak directly to his reasons for believing, or even knowing, that the administration was using that hundreds of millions to leverage Zelensky. Yet as the Times reports, Taylor might not end up testifying unless he quits the State Department to elude efforts to block him.\n\nAD\n\nWhat the White House is really arguing\n\nAll such defiance of oversight, the White House has now insisted, is the correct position, because the impeachment inquiry is itself illegitimate. The claim is absurd, but even more important is what else the White House is arguing, and what it all adds up to.\n\nIn that widely mocked letter, the White House counsel argues not just that refusing all oversight demands is perfectly legitimate, but also that there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with Trump\u2019s call to Zelensky, as documented in the rough White House transcript.\n\nAD\n\nThat is, the White House\u2019s official position is that there was nothing wrong with Trump\u2019s demand that Zelensky help him undercut our intelligence services\u2019 conclusions about Russian interference in 2016 and take out a rival for the presidency in 2020.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s glaring at us in plain sight is a straight-up declaration that Trump possesses the legitimate authority to conscript a foreign power to help him rig the next election on his behalf.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s now the official position of the White House that soliciting foreign election interference is appropriate,\u201d Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told me. The White House isn\u2019t even contesting that this happened any longer: \u201cThe White House is saying, \u2018Yeah, he did it, and it\u2019s fine.'\"\n\nLet\u2019s also note the multidimensional nature of this \u201cappropriate\u201d conduct. Trump is enlisting a foreign power both to falsify the corruption of the last election on his behalf \u2014 by covering up the truth about it \u2014 and to facilitate the corruption of the coming election on his behalf, as well.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe conscripting of the government\n\nMuch of the government has been enlisted in this effort \u2014 and to prevent the full truth about it from coming out. Attorney General William P. Barr is traveling the globe in pursuit of the first aspect of that mission. Barr\u2019s Justice Department and the acting director of national intelligence tried to unlawfully bury the whistleblower account of the scheme. Now that it did come out, the State Department is defying legitimate subpoenas designed to get to the bottom of it.\n\nTrump himself is now claiming absolute authority to do all of this. He says he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to ask other countries to investigate \u201ccorruption,\u201d while saying openly that the corruption he\u2019s talking about involves Biden, thus claiming total authority to solicit foreign help in rigging the next election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdd to this the fact that Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that his extensive and likely criminal obstruction of justice could not constitute obstruction by definition, because Trump has the power to shut down any inquiry into himself, for any reason. Those obstruction efforts, too, constituted an effort to bury the truth about the corruption of the last election on his behalf, and to elude accountability for it.\n\nAll this is the larger context in which we should view Trump\u2019s declaration that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate.\n\nAs Josh Chafetz notes, this level of defiance of oversight probably amounts to contempt of Congress, which is a crime. Trump is declaring the authority to engage in bottomless corruption to prevent his removal in a legitimate election, while also declaring the authority to corruptly \u2014 and perhaps illegally \u2014 shut down the people\u2019s last resort against it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to corrupt the election, and his placement of himself beyond all congressional oversight, are part of the same story: the attempted destruction of any and all mechanisms of accountability.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump's efforts to shut down the impeachment inquiry are just getting started.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VQnZcZG7Cxbw7co35uFn0NAuMug=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZNCHTDXLJAI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
