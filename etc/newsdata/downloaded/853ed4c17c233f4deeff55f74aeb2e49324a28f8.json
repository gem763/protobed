That prompted Trump \u2014 who has called on the central bank to slash rates to zero or below \u2014 to blast the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No 'guts,' no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator!\" Trump tweeted within minutes of the Fed's move.\n\nIn a press conference afterward, Powell studiously avoided giving any clear signal about whether and when another rate decrease would be coming, given uncertainty about the global outlook. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be highly data-dependent,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fed\u2019s move on Wednesday to cut rates is intended to reassure markets, companies and households amid signs that growth is slowing from its 2018 pace, though the central bank continues to expect the economy to expand over the next few years.\n\nFed officials nudged up their forecast of economic growth this year, projecting GDP will increase by 2.2 percent, up from a 2.1 percent estimate in June. Over the next couple of years, the Fed expects growth to drop below 2 percent, but officials stayed well away from forecasting a recession.\n\nAs the economic picture grows increasingly complex, Powell is having a tougher time achieving consensus within the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee. Three members dissented from the decision to lower rates, which follows on another cut in July; Kansas City Fed President Esther George and Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren preferred to hold rates steady, while St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard wanted a deeper cut.\n\nFollowing the Fed\u2019s quarter-point cut, its main borrowing rate is set between 1.75 and 2 percent.\n\nOf the Fed\u2019s 17 top officials, including seven who don\u2019t have a vote this year, nearly a third didn\u2019t see a need for Wednesday\u2019s cut, according to a chart of officials\u2019 best projections of the appropriate path for rates. But seven saw room for still another rate cut this year.\n\nAt his press conference, Powell also dismissed Trump\u2019s suggestion last week that the central bank cut rates below zero, a policy deployed for years in Europe and Japan with unclear results. \u201cI do not think we\u2019d be looking at using negative rates,\u201d he said.", "description": "Fed officials didn't forecast another rate reduction, but they didn't rule out the option completely", "authors": ["Victoria Guida"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/14/01/a64826c84ea7b0ba9e29eff84122/190918-powell-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
