Yet for the most part in the U.S., the storm so far has been a menace but not the catastrophe once feared.\n\nStill, Dorian disrupted daily life for many residents along the southern half of the Eastern Seaboard for a week. Coastal communities from Palm Beach, Fla., to Virginia Beach, Va., were evacuated, and schools and many businesses closed.\n\nBut the preparations proved unnecessary in many cases. People in Georgia and South Carolina joined Floridians in breathing a sigh of relief Thursday that the hurricane didn\u2019t turn into the worst-case scenario.\n\nBy early Friday, the once-Category 5 Dorian was a Category 1 hurricane, producing winds of 90 miles an hour, down from a peak of 185 mph. The storm was about 55 miles east of Wilmington, N.C., and moving northeast up the coast at 15 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. Hurricane-force winds extended 60 miles out from the storm center.\n\nForecasters said Dorian would likely continue to weaken, but warned of the potential for life-threatening storm surges and powerful winds on the North Carolina coast and portions of southeast Virginia and the southern Chesapeake Bay.\n\nLow-lying streets in Charleston\u2019s historic downtown and elsewhere in South Carolina\u2019s Lowcountry flooded Thursday as a storm surge and lashing rains swept through the area.

Henry McMaster.\n\n\u201cThe water did not get as deep as anticipated, although there is still plenty of it,\u201d Mr. McMaster said. He lifted evacuation orders in several of the state\u2019s southern counties.\n\nPeter Hill and his wife, Lauren Hill, ventured out of their downtown Charleston apartment after the storm passed to check the damage. They said they found little of note, and were even able to walk along East Battery Street along the city\u2019s harbor, which frequently floods.\n\nMr. Hill, a 38-year-old U.K. native, said there were inconveniences associated with Dorian, such as the lack of power, but it was just like a normal storm in England. \u201cI was frankly let down a bit,\u201d said Mr. Hill, who noted that a rainstorm during their wedding in Charleston caused more flooding.\n\nDorian\u2019s Path 2 p.m. Saturday 2 a.m. Saturday 5-day probable track area Va.

Barber Sr. said he had expected.\n\nAt one point, the city\u2019s 9,200 customers were without power, but most was restored by late afternoon. Mayor Barber said emergency-management officials had fretted that the confluence of high tide and the arrival of the storm would cause major flooding and potential loss of life, but initial reports showed no major issues.\n\nMr. Barber said he hosted a Facebook Live prayer vigil on Wednesday with local pastors, asking that their waterfront city be spared. \u201cWe dodged a bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cOur prayers were answered.\u201d\n\nPhotos: Hurricane Dorian Lashes East Coast, Bahamas Reel Powerful storm is causing flooding, tornadoes and power outages as it moves north A vehicle drives through floodwaters during Hurricane Dorian in Charleston,S.C., on Thursday.

And about 260,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina and South Carolina, according to poweroutage.us, which tracks data from multiple carriers.\n\nAs the storm moved slowly toward North Carolina, authorities issued a tornado warning Thursday along the coast of the Carolinas. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at least one tornado touched down and left a 10-mile stretch of destruction. The coastal town of Emerald Isle, N.C., also reported a tornado that badly damaged an RV park.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What should authorities be doing to ensure the safety of those in the path of Dorian? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe states of Florida and North Carolina reported a total of four deaths, all of them involving men who died getting ready for the hurricane.\n\nGov. Cooper said Dorian continued to be a strong and dangerous storm. It was predicted to dump as much as 7 inches of rain on the coast. Forecasters expected a storm surge could raise water levels on the North Carolina coast by 4 to 7 feet above normal tide. Inland flooding was possible through the weekend, Mr. Cooper said.\n\n\u201cEven when the sun is shining, rivers rise and flooding can occur,\u201d Mr. Cooper added.\n\nDozens of school systems closed in North Carolina ahead of the storm as far inland as Raleigh, more than two hours\u2019 drive from the coast. In coastal Wilmington, businesses shut and downtown hotels and restaurants placed sandbags by doors and windows in expectation that the Cape Fear River would flood streets, as it did during Hurricane Florence last year.\n\nEarly-voting sites closed in the eastern counties of North Carolina\u2019s Ninth Congressional District, which has a closely watched do-over election Sept. 10.\n\nA tornado hit Emerald Isle, N.C., as Hurricane Dorian moved up the East Coast.

But they said the Outer Banks\u2019 long chain of barrier islands would be subject to heavy rain, flooding and the possible washout of N.C. Highway 12, a main artery that frequently is impassable after storms.\n\nVidant Health\u2019s Outer Banks Hospital treated patients in its emergency room midday Thursday but none in its beds as the staff made final storm preparations, said Vidant officials. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go,\u201d said nurse Tony Buzzacco, director of the hospital\u2019s emergency services. \u201cWe\u2019re at that point that we\u2019re just waiting for it now.\u201d\n\nStorm shutters were secured over the hospital\u2019s windows Thursday. The hospital, a joint venture between Vidant and Chesapeake Regional Healthcare, was built to withstand sustained 150-mph winds and had stockpiled food, fuel and medical supplies during Dorian\u2019s slow approach.\n\n\u2014Melanie Evans and Erin Ailworth contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Valerie Bauerlein at valerie.bauerlein@wsj.com and Cameron McWhirter at cameron.mcwhirter@wsj.com", "description": "A weakened Hurricane Dorian trudged up the East Coast, causing flooding, tornadoes and power outages and threatening to pummel North Carolina overnight.", "authors": ["Valerie Bauerlein", "Cameron Mcwhirter", "Valerie.Bauerlein Wsj.Com", "Cameron.Mcwhirter Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104492/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
