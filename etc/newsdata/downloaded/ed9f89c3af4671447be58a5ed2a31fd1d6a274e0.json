This year was no different. Once again, we got three new phones and a new Apple Watch. But we also got some new and interesting details about the company\u2019s future.\n\nThe new iPhones, as we expected, are the iPhone 11 as well as the iPhone 11 Pro in two different sizes. They all have some fancy new wide-angle cameras. The new Apple Watch looks exactly like the old one, but now it has an always-on screen. There\u2019s also a cheap new iPad that looks slightly better than the old ones. Oh, and we learned how much Apple\u2019s new streaming video and video game services will cost. (It\u2019s not much!)\n\nThat\u2019s all you really need to know. What\u2019s perhaps most notable about the iPhone event, however, is what Apple didn\u2019t announce. Quite a few rumours didn\u2019t come true, leaving many to think that Apple is holding out for a splashier iPhone update in 2020, when the company is supposed to introduce 5G technology to its devices. This year\u2019s stuff still looks neat, though.\n\niPhone 11\n\nReplacing the iPhone XR is the iPhone 11. Like the XR, it has an anodised aluminium body and a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina LCD display. Flip the device over, however, and you\u2019ll notice a brand new dual-camera system that features a 12MP Ultra Wide camera in addition to the regular 12MP Wide Camera.\n\nThis means the iPhone 11 now features a 2X optical zoom out. (Although the module has a similar-looking stack of two cameras as the iPhone XS, there\u2019s no telephoto camera, so the iPhone 11 camera does not offer optical zoom in.) There\u2019s also a brighter new True Tone flash in the square-shaped camera module.\n\nThe upgraded camera system also takes advantage of the new, more powerful A13 Bionic processor. Apple says it\u2019s 20 per cent better performance than the A12 chip in terms of processing power, graphics, and neural processing. This enables a new feature called Deep Fusion photo processing that\u2019s supposed to offer ultra-sharp images as well as a new Night Mode that looks like a strong competitor to the Google Pixel\u2019s Night Sight.\n\nApple also improved its Smart HDR feature to offer more vivid colours. Naturally, the iPhone 11 comes with Face ID, which Apple says is faster and works from more angles. The iPhone 11 also has the new ultra-wideband U1 chip that improves the device\u2019s spatial awareness. It features up to 17 hours of battery life and is also capable of fast-charging, although you have to buy a special adaptor separately.\n\nThe iPhone 11 will come in six colours: black, green, yellow, purple, red, and white. Capacity options include 64Gb, 128GB, and 256GB. Prices start at $1,199. Pre-orders start on September 13, and the phone starts shipping on September 20.\n\niPhone 11 Pro\n\nThis is the big money item, and to the surprise of many, it is also green. The iPhone 11 Pro replaces the iPhone XS in the lineup. Like the iPhone XS, the iPhone 11 Pro features a stainless steel body and a 5.8-inch OLED display. Apple says the glass is its most durable yet, and the back of the phone now features a matte finish.\n\nSimilar to the iPhone 11, the back of the phone also features an even bigger, square-shaped camera bump with a completely new, Ultra Wide camera. Together, the three 12-MP cameras offer up to 4X optical zoom with a focal length from 13 to 52-millimetres. You can now zoom in and out with an iPhone, in other words, which is neat.\n\nBut aside from the more advanced camera system and slightly different design, the iPhone 11 Pro offers a lot of the same specs as the iPhone 11. It also has the A13 Bionic chip and all the powerful processing power that comes along with it. All the while, Apple says it\u2019s managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro battery last four hours longer than that of the iPhone XS. Like the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro can do fast-charging. Apple is even including the fast-charge adaptor in the box.\n\nThe new flagship iPhone 11 Pro will be available for pre-order on September 13 and will start shipping September 20. It will come in space grey, silver, a new shade of gold, and a very new midnight green colour. Storage options are the same 64GB, 256GB, and 512GB as last year\u2019s model. The iPhone 11 Pro starts at $1,749.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 11 Max is just the bigger version of the iPhone 11. The specs are virtually identical, except the iPhone 11 Max has a 6.5-inch screen and offers an additional hour of battery life. The iPhone 11 Max starts at $1,899.\n\nApple Watch Series 5\n\nIt looks like the Apple Watch Series 5 features exactly two new hardware upgrades: an always-on Retina display and a built-in compass. The screen uses a new low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED display that refreshes dynamically anywhere between 1Hz and 60Hz. When your wrist is down, it dims to save battery but leaves key features like the watch hands visible. Apple also says that it still has the same 18-hour battery life as the Series 4 watch.\n\nThe appeal offered by the new compass is a bit more enigmatic for now. There\u2019s a new compass app in the watch, which is useful if you\u2019re hiking in the wilderness or extremely bad at navigating the mall. Apple made a point of saying that the compass would be available to app developers, so we\u2019re sure to see all kinds of new features popping up after Watch OS 6 launches this spring. And honestly, the vast majority of new features coming to the Apple Watch Series 5 will involve software.\n\nWith the Series 5, there are also some fresh design options, including the re-introduction of the ceramic case and a new titanium case, both of which comprise the new Apple Watch Edition line. Apple also announced a new program called Apple Studio that lets you mix and match your case and band designs, instead of settling for whatever plain band used to come with your specific case and colour.\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 5 starts at $649 for the aluminium version. The titanium version starts at $1,259, and the ceramic one starts at $1,999. Pre-orders start today, and the new watches will be available on September 20.\n\nNew Cheap iPad\n\nApple\u2019s cheap iPad is finally getting a facelift. The sixth-generation 9.7-inch model is being replaced by a redesigned model with a 10.2-inch Retina display. Apple also added a Smart Connector so the entry-level model now works with a wider range of keyboards and accessories. The upcoming iPad OS will also bring lots of new features, like the ability to plug-in external storage and pair with PlayStation controllers.\n\nImage: Gizmodo Australia/Matt Hopkins\n\nWhile Apple says the new iPad is twice as fast as an unnamed \u201ctop-selling Windows PC,\u201d the new device is actually getting some older hardware. The A10 Fusion chip inside of it, for instance, dates back to the release of the iPhone 7 in 2016. The single 8MP camera on the new iPad is nothing special, and there is only Touch ID, so there\u2019s no Face ID like on the iPad Pro.\n\nOn the bright side, the cheap iPad is still cheap, starting at $529 for the Wi-Fi model and starting at $729 for the cellular model. The new iPad starts shipping on September 30.\n\nApple Arcade\n\nWe didn\u2019t get a ton of new information about Apple Arcade, the company\u2019s new gaming platform. We saw an entertaining update to the classic Frogger as well as two all-new titles called Sayonara Wild Hearts and Shinsekai Into the Depths. Apple also showed how Arcade would exist as a new tab in the App Store.\n\nThe big piece of info was Apple Arcade\u2019s price: $7.99 a month in Australia with a one-month free trial. That\u2019s pretty cheap for access to over 100 games only available on Apple devices. The service will launch on September 20.\n\nApple TV+\n\nOnce again, we\u2019d heard a lot about Apple TV+, and the company didn\u2019t show up with a lot of new information about the service.\n\nWe did see a trailer for the new Jason Momoa show See, which is a post-apocalyptic drama about humans who have lost the ability to see. Apparently, there are some babies born on this show who can see, and there\u2019s a lot of drama about whether to protect them or kill them.\n\nThe big announce: Apple TV+ will cost $7.99 a month as well. If you buy a new Apple TV, iPad, or iPhone, you get a year of Apple TV+ for free, which doesn\u2019t sound at all bad, especially compared to getting a free U2 record you didn't want.\n\nDid Apple reinvent the iPhone? Not even close. Is Apple still going to sell a lot of iPhones? Remains to be seen.", "description": "Every year it feels like Apple\u2019s big iPhone event offers fewer and fewer surprises.
