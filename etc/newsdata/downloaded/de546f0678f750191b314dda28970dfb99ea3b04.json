Both those teams on Sunday believe they\u2019re good enough to win the World Cup, it\u2019s as simple as that.\n\n\u201cIf you lose a game like that, it\u2019s going to dent your confidence. You still know you\u2019ve got a chance of qualifying but you\u2019d rather go through a World Cup unbeaten, get to the final and then win it.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think if you win the game, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the World Cup final. It means you\u2019ve got a good chance of getting to the quarters.\n\n\u201cHowever, I think psychologically it\u2019s a massive boost. If you beat a team like Australia in the pool stages, knowing when you get to the quarter-finals that you\u2019ve beaten one of the best teams, it just gives you huge momentum and confidence moving on.\u201d\n\nWilliams warned that Wales would need to combat the threat posed by David Pocock and Michael Hooper at the breakdown if they were to stand a chance against Australia.\n\n\u201cThe problem they\u2019ve had, and still have, is the breakdown for Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of turnovers against Georgia. When you\u2019ve got Pocock and Hooper in your team, turnover kings, you\u2019ve got to really deal with those guys as well.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s perhaps why you\u2019ve got two 7s playing for Wales in Josh Navidi and Justin Tipuric. those guys are going to be busy. Tipuric was superb against Georgia and that\u2019s what we need against Australia as well.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams in the world, so you\u2019ve got to be good for the full 80 minutes.\u201d", "description": "Shane Williams, Wales\u2019 record try-scorer, believes victory over Australia\u00a0on Sunday would give Warren Gatland\u2019s men the \u201cpsychological boost\u201d needed to reach the final of the\u00a0Rugby World Cup.
