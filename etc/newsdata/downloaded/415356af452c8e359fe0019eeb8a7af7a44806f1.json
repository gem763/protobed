The car\u2019s traveling. We\u2019ve got eyes in the sky,'\" Hampton said.\n\nOfficers found the three trying to pawn that stolen lawn equipment and arrested them.\n\nHampton says she hopes the suspects turn their lives around.\n\n\u201cDo something with your life. Stop doing that,\" she said. \"And I\u2019m not gonna say I hate you, but I love you with the love of the Lord, and I pray that you get your life on track.\u201d\n\nAll three men are facing several serious felony charges, including carjacking, robbery and attempted first-degree murder.\n\nThey will be in court Monday.", "description": "One of their alleged victims, who shared her story only with News Channel 3, explained how she used an app on her cell phone to help police track the suspects down.", "authors": ["Nina Harrelson"], "top_image": "https://localtvwreg.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/carjacking.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
