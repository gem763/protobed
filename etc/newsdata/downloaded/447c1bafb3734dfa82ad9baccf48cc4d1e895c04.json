The club was fined 20,000 euros ($22,000).\n\nLazio suggested late Tuesday it would appeal against what it called \"severe punishment,\" though the sanctions align with UEFA's escalating scale in discrimination cases.\n\nThe Italian club has regularly been punished by UEFA in recent years for chants and fascist salutes made by \"ultra\" fan groups.\n\nThe latest incidents were at an Oct. 3 game against Rennes.\n\nUEFA has ordered both tiers of the Curva Nord stand closed when Celtic visits on Nov. 7.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
