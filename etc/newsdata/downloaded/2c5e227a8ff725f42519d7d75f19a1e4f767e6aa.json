China GDP (growth) was not negative enough (below 6%) to alter the positive effects for the trade talks,\u201d said Stephen Innes, Asia Pacific market strategist at AxiCorp.\n\nU.S. and Chinese trade negotiators are working on nailing down a Phase 1 trade deal text for their presidents to sign next month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.\n\nAdding to the downward pressure, U.S. crude oil stockpiles surged last week by 9.3 million barrels as refinery output dropped to a two-year low, while gasoline and distillate fuel inventories decreased, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.\n\nElsewhere, the joint technical committee monitoring a global deal to cut output between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and partners, including Russia, found compliance with cuts for September stood at 236%, according to four OPEC sources.\n\n\u201cConcerns about softer growth in the demand for oil and doubts about OPEC\u2019s ability to rebalance the market on the current production cut rate will be key drags on prices in the near term,\u201d ANZ Research said in a note.\n\nOPEC and its allies have agreed to limit their oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until March 2020.\n\nOPEC lowered its 2019 global oil demand growth forecast to 0.98 million bpd, while leaving its 2020 demand growth estimate unchanged at 1.08 million bpd, according to OPEC\u2019s latest monthly report.", "description": "Oil prices slid on Friday on jitters over demand from China after the world's largest oil importer recorded its weakest quarter of economic growth in nearly three decades, dragged down by a trade dispute with the United States.", "authors": ["Jane Chung", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442130581&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H023", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
