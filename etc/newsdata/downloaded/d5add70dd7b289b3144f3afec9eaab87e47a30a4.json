Naturally, Meghan ditched the show upon marrying into the royal family, and now Suits appears to be spending its time packing as many royal LOLs into the final season as it possibly can.\n\nWhich brings us to the show fully making a joke about Prince Harry in the September 25 season finale ahead of Louis\u2019s wedding to Sheila. Basically, Louis looks all kinds of fancy, and Harvey is just all, \u201cWait a second. Are you wearing a morning coat?\u201d to which Louis replies, \u201cOf course I\u2019m wearing a morning coat. Frankly, I\u2019m disappointed you\u2019re not.\u201d AND THEN, Harvey is just all, \u201cLouis, you\u2019re not the prince of England.\u201d\n\nHa ha ha, get it?\n\nThe episode also payed homage to Meghan by way of a sweet montage, and lest you forget, they also made a joke about her becoming a duchess a few episodes back. The moment went down when Mike Ross showed up for a visit and gave everyone an update on how Meghan\u2019s character, Rachel, is doing, saying, \u201cIf I told you how good, you probably wouldn\u2019t believe me.\u201d\n\nGET IT, \u2019CAUSE SHE\u2019S A DUCHESS.\n\nFor more stories like this, including celebrity news, beauty and fashion advice, savvy political commentary, and fascinating features, sign up for the Marie Claire newsletter.\n\n\n\nsubscribe here\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Lol, the shade.", "authors": ["Mehera"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/te32kqqzcyZyLM3tgHDwEg--~B/aD05NzQ7dz0xOTQ5O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/marie_claire_447/76692fc60a542cf356e85d651ba25215", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
