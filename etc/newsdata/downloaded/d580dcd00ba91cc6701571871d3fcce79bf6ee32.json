Vance has subpoenaed the records from Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm, Mazars USA, as part of an investigation that appears targeted at possible falsification of business records related to a scheme to silence two women who alleged that they had affairs with Trump.\n\nAD\n\nIn his filing Friday, Trump returned to an argument that a lower-court judge had already rejected earlier this week. He argued that, as president, he is too important to be prosecuted while in office.\n\nAnd if presidents are too important to be prosecuted, Trump said, then it follows that they must also be too important to be burdened with an investigation by prosecutors.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf the Court holds that the President is not immune from state criminal process, then Presidents must contend not just with [Vance] but with every state and local prosecutor across the country\u201d seeking to investigate them, Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\nOnly Congress can investigate the president through the impeachment process, Trump argued. He said the Constitution gives the federal government supremacy over the states and prohibits state-level investigations that would eat up the president\u2019s time and sully his prestige.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cInvestigating the President plainly violates the Supremacy Clause,\u201d where the Constitution says that federal authority supersedes that of states, Trump\u2019s attorneys argued. \u201cThat Clause mandates that States cannot \u2018defeat the legitimate operations\u2019 of the federal government.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department also filed a brief in support of the president, though it stopped short of endorsing Trump\u2019s precedent-breaking assertion that he has absolute immunity from investigation.\n\nInstead, the Justice Department conceded that there were some instances when a local prosecutor might legally seek a president\u2019s documents \u2014 but this was not one of them.\n\n\u201cPresidential materials \u2018should not be treated as just another source of Information,\u2019 \u201d the Justice Department said, quoting a prior ruling to explain how presidential subpoenas might be permitted, but only in extraordinary circumstances. \u201cA subpoena directed at a President\u2019s records should be permitted only \u2018as a last resort.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe department said Vance needed to show a \u201cdemonstrated, specific need\u201d for the data in Trump\u2019s tax returns, as well as to demonstrate that he had already tried to obtain the same facts through other means.\n\n\u201cThe court should be ordered to stay enforcement of the subpoena as to the President\u2019s personal records unless and until \u2014 at a minimum \u2014 the District Attorney is able to make the required showing of particularized need,\u201d the Justice Department wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s arguments already have been rejected once in this case.\n\nEarlier this week, U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero dismissed Trump\u2019s lawsuit, saying that Trump\u2019s assertion of sweeping immunity was \u201crepugnant\u201d to constitutional values.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe Court cannot square a vision of presidential immunity that would place the President above the law with the text of the Constitution,\u201d or any precedent, Marrero said.\n\nAD\n\nA three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit will hear the case on Oct. 23.\n\nVance has until Tuesday to file his response to the arguments from Trump and the Justice Department. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\n\nIn past filings, Vance\u2019s office has rejected Trump\u2019s claim of immunity from investigation, saying that \u201cno such investigative immunity exists for the President or anyone else.\u201d\n\nCurrent Justice Department legal opinions hold that presidents cannot be indicted by federal prosecutors while in office. But that does not prevent presidents from being investigated by grand juries or investigators such as Robert S. Mueller III, who as special counsel examined whether Trump obstructed justice as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThis case is one of three instances in which Trump \u2014 facing investigations into his actions before he became president \u2014 has sued his investigators, seeking to block them from obtaining his financial documents.\n\nEarlier Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against Trump in another of those cases, finding that the House Oversight Committee should be able to obtain his tax returns from Mazars USA.\n\nIn that case, facing an inquiry from Congress rather than a prosecutor, Trump\u2019s attorneys effectively reversed the argument they have made against Vance.\n\nBy investigating him without a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose,\u201d Trump argued, Congress was giving up its proper role and usurping the job of prosecutors.\n\nAD\n\nThe appeals court did not accept that argument.\n\n\u201cContrary to the President\u2019s arguments, the Committee possesses authority under both the House Rules and the Constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars must comply,\u201d Judges David S. Tatel and Patricia A. Millett wrote for the court in that case.\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s loss in that case, the House Oversight Committee is not likely to obtain his tax returns anytime soon: The subpoenas will remain on hold while Trump decides whether to appeal.\n\nAD", "description": "The Justice Department filed a brief in support of the president, though it stopped short of endorsing his precedent-breaking assertion that he has absolute immunity.", "authors": ["David A.
