(Picture: Metro.co.uk)\n\nGilmore Girls is one of the most wholesome shows on TV with only one big argument among fans \u2013 are you Team Dean, Team Jess or Team Logan?\n\nThe three major loves of Rory\u2019s life all have things going for them, but ultimately it was never revealed who exactly was her perfect match.\n\nWell, now we\u2019ve done a little digging ourselves to settle the score once and for all over who would be Rory Gilmore\u2019s perfect match \u2013 and potential baby daddy to the child that she announced she was pregnant with in the final seconds of A Year in the Life.\n\n(Seriously, why would you mess with us like that?!)\n\nSpeaking to Zoe Coetzee, relationship psychologist at EliteSingles.co.uk, it\u2019s pretty obvious that the first to rule out is Dean, who despite being the best first boyfriend ever, is now happily married elsewhere with four kids.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHey, at least they\u2019ll always have the corn starch.\n\nBut even if he was single, Zoe revealed they would never have worked, and she told Metro.co.uk: \u2018Given their history, it\u2019s evident that they are not destined for a healthy and happy relationship. Rory and Dean\u2019s affair led to the end of his marriage to Lindsay.\n\nRory and Dean were cute but had their time (Picture: NBC)\n\n\u2018Although they shared a deep connection, true love should not be destructive for one another.\n\n\u2018They were cute high school sweethearts, and that\u2019s how they should remain.\u2019\n\nSo that leaves Jess \u2013 the rebel teen nephew of Luke with a penchant for literature and a severe soft spot for Rory for decades, or Logan, the college boyfriend whose heart was broken when Rory turned down his proposal in the original series finale.\n\n(Mind you, doesn\u2019t stop them from still sleeping together whenever they\u2019re both in town\u2026)\n\nJess and Rory were the true match neither saw coming (Picture: NBC)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Team Jess for the win,\u2019 Zoe declared. \u2018The broody bad boy is now all grown up. Rory and Jess were kindred spirits from the start, and truly supportive of each other.\n\n\u2018When Rory drops out of Yale, it\u2019s Jess who convinces her to go back, it\u2019s him that tells her she should write a book, and when he writes a book, he says he couldn\u2019t have done it without her.\u2019\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t always this way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When they dated, they did have a tumultuous relationship, but he was in a very difficult place in his life, and perhaps they both needed to mature and develop to be ready to have the kind of relationship that lasts,\u2019 the expert added.\n\n\u2018Their connection is natural and as easy as their banter, she can be herself with him and he is the only guy she has not cheated on,\u2019 Zoe pointed out. \u2018Their relationship is different as they actually bring out the best in each other and want the best for each other. A hallmark of healthy love.\u2019\n\nEven after all these years Logan and Rory cant let each other go but are an unhealthy match (Picture: Netflix)\n\nBut if they were to try and make it work, things are about to get complicated as far as Logan is concerned who, despite being engaged to someone else, is still hung up on Rory (and could very well be her baby daddy).\n\n\u2018Logan and Rory have always shared an irresistible chemistry,\u2019 Zoe explained. \u2018But she said no to the proposal because deep-down she knew that he isn\u2019t the one.\n\n\u2018He might tick a lot of boxes on paper, however she did not love him enough to say yes when he proposed.\n\n\u2018Partaking in an affair 8 years later is testament to their enduring connection, but the right kind of love brings out the best in you and cheating on their respective partners to be together is not a stable foundation to build a relationship on.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore: Netflix The Parent Trap and Romy and Michele star Elaine Hendrix lands part in Dynasty season 3 Umbrella Academy season 2 'coming soon' says Netflix: What to expect When does Dracula start on BBC One and who is in the cast?\n\nCongratulations Jess stans, you win this round.\n\n(Though we can\u2019t help but feel this whole Logan/Jess/Rory thing is the start of a beautiful spin-off\u2026as long as the baby isn\u2019t the Wookie\u2019s.)\n\nGilmore Girls and Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life is available on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
