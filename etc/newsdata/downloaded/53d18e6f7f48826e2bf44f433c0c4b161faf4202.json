It\u2019s the latest test between the legislative and executive branches of government, as the impeachment inquiry by House Democrats deepens.\n\nOn Monday, the House panels leading the investigation expect to hear from Fiona Hill, a former top National Security Council expert on Russia.\n\nSondland\u2019s appearance, set for Thursday, comes after a cache of text messages from top envoys provided a vivid account of their work acting as intermediaries around the time Trump urged Ukraine\u2019s new president, Volodymr Zelenskiy, to start investigations into a company linked to the family of a chief Democratic presidential rival, Joe Biden.\n\nOne witness who may not be called before Congress is the still anonymous government whistleblower who touched off the impeachment inquiry. Top Democrats say testimony and evidence coming in from other witnesses, and even the president himself, are backing up the whistleblower\u2019s account of what transpired during Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy. Lawmakers have grown deeply concerned about protecting the person from Trump\u2019s threats over the matter and may not wish to risk exposing the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday, \u201cWe don\u2019t need the whistleblower, who wasn\u2019t on the call, to tell us what took place during the call. We have the best evidence of that.\u201d\n\nSchiff said it \u201cmay not be necessary\u201d to reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity as the House gathers evidence.\n\n\u201cOur primary interest right now is making sure that that person is protected,\u201d he said.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry is testing the Constitution\u2019s system of checks and balances as the House presses forward with the probe and the White House dismisses it as \u201cillegitimate\u201d without a formal vote of the House to open impeachment proceedings.\n\nIn calling for a vote, the White House is trying to press House Democrats who may be politically reluctant to put their names formally behind impeachment. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has resisted those efforts and is unlikely to budge as Congress returns. Democrats say Congress is well within its power as the legislative branch to conduct oversight of the president and it is Republicans, having grown weary of Trump\u2019s actions, who may be in the greater political bind over a vote.\n\nRep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said Sunday he\u2019d be fine with taking a formal vote, \u201cbut it\u2019s not required.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, my own opinion is that we ought to just take this off the table because it\u2019s such a non-issue, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that of course if Nancy Pelosi does that she will have the votes and that will pass,\u201d Himes said.\n\nSondland\u2019s appearance comes after text messages from top ambassadors described their interactions leading up to Trump\u2019s call and the aftermath.\n\nSondland is set to tell lawmakers that he did understand the administration was offering Zelenskiy a White House visit in exchange for a public statement committing to investigations Trump wanted, according to the person, who demanded anonymity to discuss remarks not yet given.\n\nBut Sondland will say he did not know the company being talked about for an investigation, Burisma, was tied to Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, the person said. Sondland understood the discussions about combating corruption to be part of a much broader and publicized Trump administration push that was widely shared, the person said.\n\nIn the text exchange, the diplomats raised alarm that Trump appeared to up the ante, withholding military aid to Ukraine over the investigation.\n\nOne seasoned diplomat on the text message, William Taylor, called it \u201ccrazy to withhold security assistance\u201d to Ukraine in exchange for \u201chelp with a political campaign.\u201d\n\nSondland responds that the assertion is \u201cincorrect\u201d about Trump\u2019s intentions. \u201cThe President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d he said in the text message.\n\nThe person familiar with Sondland\u2019s testimony said that before Sondland sent that text, he spoke to Trump, who told him there was no quid pro quo. Sondland then repeated that message to Taylor.\n\nSchiff appeared on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS and Himes spoke on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nTucker reported from Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A U.S. ambassador is expected to tell Congress that his text message reassuring another envoy that there was no quid pro quo in their interactions with Ukraine was based solely on what President Trump told him, according to a person familiar with his coming testimony in the impeachment probe.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Eric Tucker", "Mary Clare Jalonick", "Lisa Mascaro"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/trump_impeachment_ambassador_60211_c0-0-2355-1373_s1200x700.jpg?8222355b298384c946dfd7f5da48865d227041b5", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
