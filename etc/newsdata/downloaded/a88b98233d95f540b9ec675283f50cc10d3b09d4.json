You don't know how to hold onto love but you know how to hold onto hurt.\"\n\nScialfa, his wife of nearly 30 years and member of his famed E Street Band, plays guitar and sings in the film, but also is charming in home movie from the pair's honeymoon.\n\nSpringsteen reminisces about the early days of their romance spent on a park bench in front of New York's Empire Diner, where he eventually proposed.\n\n\"When you're young, it's all about going where I want to go, doing what I want to do, I'm going to be who I want to be, and that's okay for your 20s,\" he told late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel this week.\n\n\"But somewhere in your 30s, it starts to catch up with you and your definition of freedom has to expand to include family, your civic life, you know, community that you're involved in,\" he continued. \"If it doesn't... you get stuck out in the cold, you know? Really out in the cold.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Though Bruce Springsteen's songs are a vibrant part of the contemporary American songbook, he regularly uses his lyrics to express his deep misgivings about the proverbial \"American dream.\" With \"Western Stars,\" a full-length feature film out Friday that marks the Boss's directorial debut, New Jersey's favorite son is once again\u2026", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/2c/1d/dacfd3f8e57d453b6a6e894fd3e7c038cc4a/2c1ddacfd3f8e57d453b6a6e894fd3e7c038cc4a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
