(Hubble Heritage / Rudy Pohl / SWNS)\n\nA stunning image shows a galactic battle \u2013 an entire galaxy being torn apart because it drifted too close to its neighbour.\n\nThe arms of the spiral galaxy, spanning billions of miles, are being bent out of shape in a giant celestial wrestling match due to the massive forces of gravity generated by a neighbouring galaxy.\n\nNASA\u2019s Hubble Telescope captured the incredible scene, where gravity twisted the starburst galaxy\u2019s spiral arms out of shape and triggered bright bursts of exploding stars. NGC 7714 is a spiral galaxy located 100 million light-years from Earth \u2013 making it a relatively close neighbour in cosmic terms.\n\nIt has a rough relationship with rogue neighbour NGC 7715, a smaller galaxy lying just outside of the image.\n\nRetired pastor Rudy Pohl \u2018meticulously\u2019 produced the image by assigning different colours to a \u2018grainy\u2019 raw shot taken by the Hubble Telescope. The 16-hour job won the amateur astrophotographer his second NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) award in just six months on October 9.\n\nRudy Pohl who processed the image from the Nasa Hubble Telescope\u2019s publically available archive (Rudy Pohl / SWNS.com)\n\nRudy, 69, of Ottowa in Canada, said: \u2018It\u2019s one of the most beautiful images I have compiled. \u2018It\u2019s an attempt to show the gravitational forces of elements in space. This stuff is moving at hundreds of thousands of miles an hour, but when you look at them over the years they barely move.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the vastness of space.\u2019\n\nThe two galaxies became entangled between 100 and 200 million years ago, and began morphing each other\u2019s shape. A ring and two long tails of stars emerged, creating a bridge between the two galaxies. This bridge acts as a pipeline, funnelling material from the smaller galaxy towards its larger companion. That material feeds bursts of star formation concentrated at the bright galactic centre.\n\nRudy is one of \u2018thousands\u2019 of astro-enthusiasts around the world who use publicly available data from the Hubble Legacy Archive website to produce pristine celestial images.\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope (Nasa/National Geographic/Getty Images)\n\nHe added: \u201cThe Nasa photographers shoot the image with a red filter for a few hours at a time. They then do the same with a green and blue filter. The raw image is very grainy and blurry. So I meticulously assign the different tones of red, blue and green to produce the final picture.\n\n\u2018Nasa astrophotographers often assign the colours themselves. When they do, the ultimate goal is getting your image to look just like theirs.\u2019\n\nNGC 7714 galaxy was discovered by astronomer John Herschel on 18 September 1830.
