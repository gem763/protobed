It\u2019s bad for Democrats. I mean how do they even keep the lights on over there. The chasm between the Republican National Convention and their Democratic counterparts is immense. It feels like the distance is akin to that of the entire continent of Asia. The RNC brought in nearly $30 million for September alone, around four times as much at the DNC. And this comes after the GOP\u2019s $125 million haul for the third quarter. Thus far, the RNC has a $300 million war chest for President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, a number that is making Democrats tremble. It\u2019s a figure that some local operatives feel cannot be matched, even when the full 2020 cycle is kicked into high gear.\n\nIt\u2019s the ghosts of 2012, but this time the roles are reversed. No wonder why Obama campaign veterans are worried. The Democrats are the ones gashing and slicing each other to win the nomination, while the Trump machine is able to run a general election campaign. They\u2019re poised to define the 2020 Democratic nominee\u2014actually the entire Democratic Party establishment\u2014before they can get any semblance of a general effort going for themselves. That\u2019s an election killer right there, and we\u2019re not even talking about the Left\u2019s utterly radical, geographically rigid, and immensely unpopular agenda they\u2019re peddling. Its core tenets are simply not winnable issues. Even some Democrats at these debates reportedly were doubting whether they fit in with this Democratic Party.\n\nIn the end, the face of the party apparatus, Tom Perez, has been rather lackluster. And it appears his inability to raise money is starting to worry about the rank-and-file. Former South Carolina Democratic Party chair did not mince words, even though these remarks should have been made in anonymity. And yes, the folks at the RNC and Trump campaign had a good laugh over this one (via Politico) [emphasis mine]:\n\nBest part is that this person didn't even request anonymity. https://t.co/6b50yNgLKx \u2014 Andrew Clark?? (@AndrewHClark) October 21, 2019\n\nPolitico buried the lede!\n\n\n\n\"Tom Perez is as useless as tits on a boar hog. My advice to Tom Perez is quit, get out of the way or do something different.\" https://t.co/nQVA7vvaOE \u2014 Steve Guest (@SteveGuest) October 21, 2019\n\n[Warning: some coarse language]:\n\nDonald Trump and the Republican National Committee have raised more than $300 million this year for his reelection \u2014 more than any other sitting president in history at this point in the campaign. Trump has nearly twice as much cash on hand \u2014 $158 million, between his campaign account and the RNC \u2014 as Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee had at this time in his successful re-election run. Already this year, Trump\u2019s campaign operation has spent close to $23 million on TV and digital advertising, more than 10 times the amount that the lone major Democratic super PAC spending against him, Priorities USA, has laid out so far in its online-only spending campaign. Democrats are growing increasingly alarmed by the spending chasm between the two sides \u2014 and its implications for the general election. \u201cThe resources he has will be put to work anywhere and everywhere that he feels like he can scare up electoral votes, and Democrats will never catch up. It\u2019s just too much money,\u201d said Chris Lippincott, a Texas-based Democratic strategist who ran a super PAC opposing Sen. Ted Cruz last year. \u201cThat\u2019s real trouble \u2026 I\u2019m not here to curse the dark, but it\u2019s dark.\u201d [\u2026] Some Democratic campaign veterans fear the party is underestimating both the level of Trump\u2019s preparations for 2020 and what it will take to unseat a sitting president. The level of preparation by Trump\u2019s staff echoes Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign, said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election. \u201cWe were sophisticated, we were organized, and we were well-funded. This is everything the Trump operation is. Taking away his craziness, he has an extremely professional operation,\u201d said Gifford\u2026 [\u2026] One challenge for Democrats within the party\u2019s fundraising ecosystem is already surfacing: intraparty sniping about who should be stepping up to raise money for Democrats. After Republicans announced a multi-million ad assault in early states against Biden, the former vice president\u2019s supporters and DNC critics lashed out at the party apparatus, saying it should help defend against Trump\u2019s attempts to take out one of the Democratic frontrunners. DNC Chairman Tom Perez has said it wasn\u2019t the DNC\u2019s role. One of Biden\u2019s supporters, Dick Harpootlian, a former DNC member and two-time South Carolina Democratic Party chair, took aim at Perez, saying his inability to come within striking distance of GOP fundraising \u2014 even at a time when Trump is facing impeachment \u2014 has put Democrats in a grave situation. \u201cTom Perez is as useless as tits on a boar hog,\u201d said Harpootlian. \u201cMy advice to Tom Perez is quit, get out of the way or do something different. Maybe they need to send a spy to the Republican shop and find out how they\u2019re raising hundreds of millions of dollars off of a guy like Donald Trump.\"\n\nOuch. The publication did try to shine some positive light on the Democrats, namely that the 2020 crop has collectively outraised the Trump campaign, but that money is then sliced like sushi to other areas, like attacking the other Democrats running for president. And unlike the 2012 GOP field, which ran on tax cuts, fewer regulations, and job growth, the Democratic primary is one that is just a notch or two above a Communist Party of America rally. It\u2019s insane. The race to who can clinch the title of \u2018craziest liberal in America\u2019 to clinch the nomination will be more than enough time for Trump and the RNC to plot their counterattack. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden are the cream of the crop. One just had a heart attack, the other cannot say whether her forced health care plan will raise taxes on the middle class (huge red flag), and Joe Biden is lost half the time. Warren is also the original Rachel Dolezal when it comes to cultural appropriation. These are the people we have to beat. Right now, it\u2019s easy to mock how shoddy the field it, the explicit weaknesses, and the radical positions on policy. But Democrats are organized, they will be able to raise funds, and we cannot let up. Keep that boot on the throat and press down until all signs of life fade.", "description": ".10/22/2019 9:27:03AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/252/471a206f-934f-44fa-b161-f628ccd086f3.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
