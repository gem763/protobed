So Why the Mystery?", "language": "en", "text": "Older patients and those who experience complications like heart rhythm abnormalities, heart attacks or heart failure may remain in the hospital longer. A patient\u2019s condition usually determines the length of stay.\n\nIn the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Sanders\u2019s doctor said that the senator was \u201cin overall very good health.\u201d His ailments included gout; a mild elevation of cholesterol; an inflammation of out-pouches in the bowel known as diverticulitis; and hormone replacement therapy for an underactive thyroid gland. He had no reported history of heart disease.\n\nTuesday\u2019s episode of angina appears to be his first such incident. Doctors often refer to such heart issues as new onset, or unstable, angina and usually describe an event like Mr. Sanders\u2019s as acute coronary syndrome.\n\nMr. Sanders\u2019s status as a presidential candidate may influence his care and possibly lead to his staying in the hospital a bit longer than usual for patients with his ailment. Although doctors say they care for V.I.P.s as they do any other patient, they may deviate from the norm out of caution or if complications occur. A danger in V.I.P. care is a tendency to do too little or too much for a patient .\n\nIn cases like Mr. Sanders\u2019s, doctors perform a standard procedure known as cardiac catheterization. In it, they thread thin tubes into chambers of the heart and inject a radio-opaque dye to produce X-rays outlining the coronary arteries. For Mr. Sanders, the procedure revealed blockage in one artery; he has not said which artery . Doctors would then remove the blockage, which is usually caused by deposits of fatty substances, by inflating a tiny balloon in a tube to squash them. Implanting the stents aims at preventing development of scar tissue and recurrence of the blockage.\n\nAll presidential hopefuls strive to portray themselves in good health. When a medical event occurs, candidates and their aides, who usually have had little if any medical knowledge, often scurry to play it down to prevent damage to the leader\u2019s image.", "description": "Mr. Sanders has not disclosed health details like whether blood and electrocardiogram tests showed he had a heart attack, nor allowed reporters to interview his doctors.", "authors": ["Lawrence K.
