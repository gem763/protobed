Other teams would have probably capitulated.\u201d\n\nVahaamahina had stunned the Welsh by bundling over from a lineout after just five minutes before France scored one of the tries of the tournament.\n\nRoared on by chants of \u201cAllez, Les Bleus!\u201d flanker Charles Ollivon stormed through to complete a sweeping move involving Virimi Vakatawa, Romain Ntamack and scrum-half Antoine Dupont.\n\nBack came Wales in an electrifying opening 12 minutes as flanker Wainwright pounced on a loose ruck on halfway to race clear for his first Test try.\n\n\u2013 Reckless elbow \u2013\n\nBiggar slotted a penalty to bring the Six Nations champions to within two points.\n\nBut when a high tackle from substitute Ross Moriarty on Gael Fickou resulted in a yellow card, France made Wales pay as Damian Penaud released Vakatawa to grab France\u2019s third try on the half-hour mark.\n\nFrench playmaker Ntamack struck the post with a penalty just before the break but the pendulum swung towards Wales after Vahaamahina\u2019s rush of blood.\n\nCaught on camera recklessly swinging his elbow flush into Wainwright\u2019s face, it was only ever going to result in a red card.\n\nHis dismissal came as an ironic twist as then Welsh captain Sam Warburton received an early red card for a dangerous tip tackle on Vincent Clerc in that 2011 semi-final in Auckland.\n\nWales, who had won seven of their last eight games against France, were still made to work for it in a nail-biting finish.\n\nBut just when France looked like holding out for a famous victory, Moriarty popped up after a monster Welsh scrum.\n\nMaking up for his earlier indiscretion, the replacement forward bulldozed over six minutes from time before Biggar kicked the conversion that broke French hearts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dispute the red card \u2014 he made contact with the player\u2019s face,\u201d shrugged Brunel, who claimed there was a knock-on in the build-up to Moriarty\u2019s decisive try.\n\n\u201cBut there were other decisions I didn\u2019t agree with \u2014 I\u2019d like to see those images again.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead to the semi-finals, Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones said: \u201cThe days and weeks feel a little bit longer because of the magnitude of the occasion but we\u2019ve been to some dark places in preparation for this.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Substitute Ross Moriarty snatched a late winner as Wales eliminated 14-man France 20-19 in a breathless World Cup quarter-final", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/0a52c8_wales-needed-late-try-14-man-france-wales-floor-14-man-france-exorcise-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
