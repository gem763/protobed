Mark Allen died on Saturday at the age of 46, 10 years after being injured in the hunt for his missing comrade.\n\nHe spent 21 years in the army and national guard, and retired in 2013 on receiving the Purple Heart.\n\nHe had been unable to walk or speak since a sniper shot him in the head in July 2009 while he was looking for Bergdahl, who had walked off his base in Afghanistan and was held by the Taliban for five years.\n\nAt Bergdahl's trial, Allen's wife Shannon testified that it would take up to 90 minutes each morning to get her husband out of bed, showered, and dressed. She had to use a pulley system attached to the ceiling to move him.", "description": "A US soldier shot in the head during the 2009 search for army deserter Bowe Bergdahl has died from his injuries.", "authors": ["Harriet Alexander", "William Hague"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2016/12/04/JS115197806_FR83921-AP_Bowe-Bergdah2l-NEWS-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq3VPGG0kT-UwTbOOqgA0Jd6_qRYrSU6X_GnQkSAtQ0mA.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
