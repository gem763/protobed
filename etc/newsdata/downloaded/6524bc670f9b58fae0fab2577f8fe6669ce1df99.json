Now it\u2019s the dumping ground of the Middle East,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was unconvinced by the government\u2019s rescue plan, announced on Monday by Prime Minister Saad Hariri.\n\n\u201cThey have been in power for years, why did they just wake up to these reforms now?\u201d Ramadan asked.\n\n\u201cToday, the decisions are not in their hands. They are in the hands of the people.\u201d\n\nAmong the measures were a 2020 budget meant to bring the deficit down to 0.63 percent of GDP, without new taxes, along with a privatisation programme and projects to support the underprivileged.\n\nThe agreed reforms will also halve the salaries of current and former lawmakers and ministers.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Let the banks pay\u2019 \u2013\n\nA couple of dozen demonstrators shouted slogans in front of the central bank on Tuesday, despite the premier\u2019s announcement.\n\n\u201cDown with the rule of the central bank. We won\u2019t pay the taxes. Let the banks pay them,\u201d they chanted.\n\nHeiko Wimmen, analyst with the International Crisis Group, said it appeared Monday\u2019s measures were not enough.\n\n\u201cThese mostly technical solutions may put the country on a sounder fiscal footing, but they appear inadequate to the challenge of the protests, which now demand broader, systemic change,\u201d he said.\n\nThe country\u2019s main parties, including those of President Michel Aoun and the Shiite movement Hezbollah, have warned of a political vacuum and supported the reform package.\n\nHariri met top ambassadors in Beirut Tuesday, hoping to restore confidence that Lebanon can handle its ballooning debt and unlock a huge aid package approved in Paris last year.\n\n\u201cWe believe, after the announcement of the decisions of the cabinet yesterday, that we\u2019re going to get very positive reactions\u201d from the international community, senior government advisor Nadim Munla told reporters.\n\nLebanon\u2019s economy has been sliding closer to the abyss in recent months, with public debt soaring past 150 percent of GDP and ratings agencies grading Lebanese sovereign bonds as \u201cjunk\u201d.\n\nFears of a default have compounded the worries of Lebanese citizens exasperated by the poor quality of public services.\n\nResidents suffer daily electricity shortages and unclean water.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Only chance\u2019 \u2013\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Lebanese army was trying to reopen a number of major roads that have been blocked by demonstrators for days, the state-run National News Agency reported.\n\nIn Beirut, volunteers cleaned up streets after euphoric crowds partied deep into the night on Monday, dancing to impromptu concerts and DJ sets.\n\nIt is unclear how long protests will last, but banks said they would remain closed on Wednesday, having shuttered last week as the demonstrations gained momentum.\n\nGiven the size of the gatherings, the six-day-old mobilisation has been remarkably incident-free, with armies of volunteers providing water to protesters and organising first aid tents.\n\nHariri seemed aware that the measures he announced would not quench the people\u2019s thirst for change, telling protestors on Monday the plan was not simply a \u201ctrade-off\u201d to get people off the streets.\n\nLebanon fought a devastating 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and many of the country\u2019s politicians today were formerly warlords fighting along sectarian lines in the conflict.\n\nOutside of Lebanon, expats in Europe, the United States and Africa staged sit-ins and demonstrations in solidarity.\n\nIn Beirut, Mounir Malaaeb, an elderly man from the southern city of Tyre who came to the capital to join the rallies, said the protest movement was \u201cthe only chance the people have\u201d.\n\n\u201cIf we give the government another chance, we would be crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been giving them chances since the 1990s.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Tens of thousands of Lebanese protesters kept the country on lockdown on Tuesday, rallying for a sixth consecutive day to demand new leaders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Lebanon.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
