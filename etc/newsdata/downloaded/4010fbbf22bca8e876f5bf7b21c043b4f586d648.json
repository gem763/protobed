It didn't take long for fans to crowd the feed with their answers before Grande herself commented on the video with her signature black hearts and shared a clip on her Instagram Story.\n\nThe remix starts the same as the original, but listeners can hear Grande's very own verse with lines like \"Cause he better know my worth/There's much that I deserve\" to give you some major caption inspo for your next girls' night out. The song ends with a blend of their voices and the \"7 Rings\" singer's familiar laugh.\n\nThe lead single, off Lizzo's 2016 Coconut Oil EP, was already a hit on the charts for its strong message of body positivity and self-love. So, adding the \"Thank U, Next\" singer (who gifted us with not one, but two albums plus a ton of features this year) is the icing on the cake. Both pop stars have had their fair share of groundbreaking moments with Lizzo being the longest-running solo female rapper with \"Truth Hurts\" and Grande becoming the first act to hold the top three spots on the Billboard Hot 100 list since The Beatles.\n\nThe remix is out now on every streaming service and even garnered more than 300,000 views on YouTube since its release at midnight. We're just going to need a live performance (or a possible music video?).\n\nDon't mind us, this weekend we'll be playing this song over and over again (along with a hair toss).\n\nRELATED: Rihanna Just Released Her Visual Autobiography Book (and Our Coffee Table Is Getting an Upgrade)", "description": "The \\\"Truth Hurts\\\" singer hinted about the collab on Instagram Live on Thursday with one clue: a Starbucks drink. \\\"If you can guess the size of this drink, you'll...", "authors": ["Editor Purewow.Com", "Purewow"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/17Y5UwvwJT.4UdWiOpdcDA--~B/aD0yOTA7dz00MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/purewow_185/7a9b3b0a38ca38ed645deef24cfdfca2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
