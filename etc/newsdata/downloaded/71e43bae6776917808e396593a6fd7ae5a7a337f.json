Source: Coin360\n\nBitcoin analyst prepares for range-bound trading\n\nData from Coin360 showed BTC/USD circling $8,350 on Friday, having jumped to a local high of above $8,770 earlier.\n\nThe enthusiasm was short-lived, with the following crash taking the pair below its previous levels. Daily losses for Bitcoin totaled 2.3% at press time, while the largest cryptocurrency remained up 2.6% versus the same point last week.\n\nBitcoin seven-day price chart.

Specifically, the decision by U.S. regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission to reject the latest Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) failed to dent sentiment.\n\nPrevious ETF denials had piled downward pressure on Bitcoin, suggesting markets this time had already price in a negative decision. Another major ETF offering was withdrawn by its sponsors in September, hinting at a lack of confidence in the instrument winning approval.\n\nFor the short-term future, however, analysts assumed it would be business as usual for Bitcoin. Regulator Cointelegraph contributor and market analyst Micha\u00ebl van de Poppe eyed a narrower trading corridor centered on $8,300.\n\n\u201cContinue the ranging for now,\u201d he summarized in a fresh update on Friday morning.\n\nVan de Poppe said that $8,300, as the monthly opening price, would form support, while resistance closer to $8,500 remained \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\nFor fellow contributor crypto trader Scott Melker, the recent activity was calculated by large bagholders. He told Cointelegraph:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think whales stopped hunting. I just think they started hunting for liquidity to sell and short, and the $8800 area was a predictable area to do so. Pushing price up to engineer liquidity was a logistical move.\u201d\n\nAltcoins shed 3% amid mixed sentiment\n\nFor altcoins, a day of underwhelming returns for Bitcoin translated into similarly lackluster performance. Trending in line with BTC, the major of the top twenty cryptocurrencies posted daily losses of 2-3%.\n\nEther (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 1.7% to $186, better than most, while Binance Coin (BNB) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) lost closer to 3%. XRP also bucked the trend, staying stable at 0.7% lower.\n\nEther seven-day price chart.
