The series range from pulp to prestige, and run the gamut of genres and formats. He\u2019s tackled true crime, anthology series, the half-hour network single-cam, period pieces, procedurals both medical and police, and teen dramas, thrice over. And things aren\u2019t slowing down for him, either. This month, season nine of American Horror Story premiered on FX. And just today, the first project in Murphy\u2019s Netflix deal \u2014 the Ben Platt\u2013starring series The Politician \u2014 has debuted for all to watch.\n\nThroughout all of Murphy\u2019s far-flung concepts, some hallmarks carry over: a love of music, pastiche, exaggerated aesthetic, one-woman catchphrase machines, strokes of meta commentary about pop culture and stardom, power plays and group infighting, and broad emotional strokes. One other element that carries over throughout Murphy\u2019s work: his stable of talent, who flit between series and alternate between hero and villain roles, switching out period-appropriate wigs. Here, we\u2019ve compiled a guide to the most prominent recurring players of the Murphy-verse.\n\nNote: we\u2019re only counting American Horror Story as one series, so AHS MVPs like Denis O\u2019Hare and Taissa Farmiga did not make the list. We appreciate you, Denis O\u2019Hare!\n\nSarah Paulson\n\nPhoto: FX\n\nYou\u2019ve seen her as: patient of the week Agatha Ripp on Nip/Tuck (she had self-inflicted stigmata!); Marcia Clark on The People v.
