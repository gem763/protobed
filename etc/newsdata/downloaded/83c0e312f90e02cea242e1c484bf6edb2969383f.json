I still am worried that I, for whatever reason, maybe can't be pregnant and do my job at the same time because I couldn't before'\n\n'Nobody likes the word miscarriage. I think there's a lot of shame attached to it, and a lot of sadness, and there's a lot of societal stigma about it, but I'd rather talk about it than not talk about it,' she said.\n\nWhen she miscarried, she said, 'I felt so ashamed.'\n\n'I had to take time off of work ... I still am worried that I, for whatever reason, maybe can't be pregnant and do my job at the same time because I couldn't before.\n\n'I was very, very, very hard on myself, and I blamed the stress of my life, and I blamed being older, and I blamed my personality, and I blamed things that were not rational,' she went on.\n\nHer feelings about it became more rational over time, but urged others to go easy on themselves, saying it's 'physically and emotionally just an an extremely intense and extremely difficult thing to go through.'\n\n'Since then I have tried to just go a little easier on myself in all things having to do with motherhood and pregnancy-related because it's not easy being a woman. It's just not.\n\nFamily: Meghan, 35, and her husband Ben Domenech were expecting their first child\n\n'I've always been sort of agnostic about having kids,' she said. 'And I think my response and how sad I felt afterward surprised me'\n\nMeghan said before she got pregnant, she wasn't even totally sure about having children, so she was surprised by how hard the loss hit her.\n\n'I've always been sort of agnostic about having kids,' she said. 'I don't feel naturally maternal. I don't feel this natural draw to motherhood. And I think my response and how sad I felt afterward surprised me.\n\n'It just hit me a lot harder than I thought it would. I never even thought about having a miscarriage. I never even thought about being pregnant until it happened,' she went on.\n\nShe argued that her job is a constant reminder that she miscarried.\n\n'Daytime TV is really hard to be childless and 35,' she said. 'Every day I'm reminded that I'm not a mom.'\n\nMeghan said that she thinks fans of The View assume people on TV have perfect lives. But that's not true, and she wants to be open about her experiences.\n\n'Daytime TV is really hard to be childless and 35,' she said. 'Every day I'm reminded that I'm not a mom'\n\n'I blamed the stress of my life, and I blamed being older, and I blamed my personality, and I blamed things that were not rational,' she went on\n\n'I just want people to feel less alone, because I felt very, very alone,' she said.\n\n'I just think that people need to treat [miscarriage] the way that we treat any other kind of loss. But I also feel like as a society we are nowhere near where we need to be talking about grief and death and loss. It's hard. It's just really, really, really hard,' she added.\n\n'And I empathize with all women who've gone through it. And who may go through it. It's just horrific, and it doesn't' really get easier either.'\n\nMeghan also connected the loss of her unborn child to that of her father.\n\n'It felt like this very strange circle of life experience that just included a lot of death and a lot of tragedy,' she said.\n\n'And I always describe it as the inverse of losing my dad, because my dad was like, the ending of a beautiful long-lived life, and I grieve that. And the way I grieved having a miscarriage and my daughter was what could have been.'\n\nMeghan had first revealed she miscarried in the New York Times on July 19.\n\nSweet: Meghan is pictured in June with co-host Abby Huntsman and her twins\n\nCandid: Meghan first opened up about her loss in a New York Times op-ed\n\n'My miscarriage was a horrendous experience and I would not wish it upon anyone,' she wrote.\n\n'Since then, I have asked the same question every mother asks who loves and loses a child: Why? Why was this light and joy held before us, and then the world where this child drew breath cast into shadow? Why was an innocent life created in the image of God and then abruptly snuffed out?\n\n'I blamed myself,' she went on. 'Perhaps it was wrong of me to choose to be a professional woman, working in a high-pressure, high-visibility, high-stress field, still bearing the burden of the recent loss of my father and facing on top of that the arrows that come with public life.\n\nGoal: In an Instagram post, The View co-host said she hopes sharing her story will help others 'who have experienced the same to feel less alone'\n\n'This, I told myself, is the reason my body is a rock-strewn wasteland in which no child may live. This is my fault.\n\n'Yet it is not my fault,' she said,\n\n'I had a miscarriage. I loved my baby, and I always will. To the end of my days I will remember this child \u2014 and whatever children come will not obscure that. I have love for my child. I have love for all the women who, like me, were briefly in the sisterhood of motherhood, hoping, praying and nursing joy within us, until the day the joy was over.'\n\nDays later, she spoke more on the subject in an Instagram post, thanking those who had reached out to her for their 'beautiful and kind responses' to her op-ed.\n\n'Ben and I are the luckiest, most incredibly blessed people in the world surrounded by love and support,' she wrote. 'My hope is by continuing to share grief and loss, and addressing these taboo subjects head on it will help people who have experienced the same to feel less alone. None of us are alone in this.\n\n'I was petrified to share my story publicly but I never, ever let fear dictate my life choices. I will always take the leap, I will always roll the dice,' she added.\n\nMeghan ended her thoughtful post by paying tribute to her husband Ben.\n\n'And to this man who loves my wild heart, has never tried to change a single thing about me, and continues to be the greatest source of strength, love and faith a woman could ever ask for - I thank God for sending you to me every day, Ben,' she wrote, adding the hashtag '#rideordie.'", "description": "The 35-year-old revealed in July that she and\u00a0husband Ben Domenech were expecting their first child this year when she miscarried", "authors": ["Carly Stern For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/16/20387248-0-image-a-46_1572454331400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
