His remarks were contained in a transcript that was emailed to the media in the Philippines on Sunday.\n\nThere is no cure for myasthenia gravis, an illness that causes muscle weakness, but treatment can help relieve symptoms.\n\nThe firebrand leader, 74 is known for a busy schedule and for giving long speeches, often several a day. Several disappearances from public view in the past fueled rumors he is in declining health. The government has repeatedly denied that.\n\nDuterte's latest comments could raise more questions about the state of his health.\n\nDuterte's known ailments include back problems, migraines due to nerve damage after a motorcycle accident and Barrett's esophagus, which affects his throat. He also suffers from Buerger's disease, caused by his heavy smoking in younger days, which can cause blockages in the blood vessels.\n\nLast October, Duterte underwent a colonoscopy, a procedure to check the health of the rectum and lower bowel, which officials said the president does on yearly basis.\n\nThe Philippine Constitution mandates that the public must be informed of the state of the president's health in case he has a serious illness.\n\nUnder Philippine laws, if a sitting president dies in office, is permanently disabled or removed through impeachment, the vice president takes over and serves the remaining years in a six-year, single term. Vice President Leni Robredo, a leader of the political opposition, was elected in 2016, the same year Duterte was elected.
