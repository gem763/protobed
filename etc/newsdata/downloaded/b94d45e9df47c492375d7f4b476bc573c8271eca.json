After the three-hour movie showed to critics at the fest, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, first-time Scorsese collaborator Al Pacino, and producers Jane Rosenthal and Emma Tillinger Koskoff answered questions from festival director Kent Jones. After a few opening questions for Scorsese, Jones directed one to the infamously tight-lipped Pesci, who hasn\u2019t acted in a movie since 2006: \u201cI wonder if you could talk about coming aboard on this project after it\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve appeared in a film. I think the last one was Bob\u2019s film, The Good Shepherd.\u201d\n\nPesci, expressionless, threw up his hands. \u201cNo.\u201d And then: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say \u2026\u201d Rosenthal stepped in to put the question a different way. \u201cDid you have any pressure?\u201d she asked. Pesci, ever the wordsmith, shook his head. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have any pressure.\u201d Courtesy of the critic and writer Karen Han, enjoy 27 seconds of bliss:\n\nJOE PESCI THE LEGEND pic.twitter.com/KR9gG12mH6 \u2014 karen han (@karenyhan) September 27, 2019\n\nJoe Pesci is back, folks, and thank God he\u2019s just the same.", "description": "At the press conference for The Irishman at the New York Film Festival Friday afternoon, Joe Pesci was a regular chatterbox.
