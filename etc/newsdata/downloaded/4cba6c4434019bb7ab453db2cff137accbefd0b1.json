Fly to Florida tomorrow. Flight home on 27th cancelled. Help please? Cant rebook or cancel on line. This is disgusting!\u201d\n\n\u201cDugmac\u201d tweeted: \u201cAs you left it to the last possible moment to say my 27/9 flight is cancelled (to avoid paying extra compensation if cancel within 14 days) & as my date is fixed I\u2019ve had to pay an extra \u00a3350 to fly with someone else as few options left.\u201d\n\nJuan Huelga tweeted: \u201cFirst you cancel my flight, then tells me I need to call, then I called and an answer machine tells me that you have high volume calls, told me to call later and hung up on me. Nice customer experience. I haven\u2019t started my holidays and you already ruined it.\u201d\n\nThe pilots\u2019 union said: \u201cBalpa set a gap between the first and second periods of strike action to give BA time to work with us to settle this dispute with their pilots.\n\n\u201cWe had today been exchanging new ideas to do that via Acas and so it irresponsible and inconsiderate to its customers that BA has pulled out and decided to start cancelling flights now, just to save money on compensation.\n\n\u201cBA did not respond to our latest proposals before cancelling these flights. Passengers who will be affected by these cancellations should know that we have given BA multiple opportunities to work with us so we could call off this action.\u201d\n\nThe airline responded: \u201cWe have put forward new ideas through Acas this week and have called on Balpa to meet us face-to-face as soon as possible to return to negotiations.\n\n\u201cHowever, we need to give our customers certainty, so we have contacted all those affected by the union\u2019s strike on 27 September.\u201d", "description": "As tens of thousands of British Airways passengers learn that their flights have been cancelled because of the next pilots\u2019 strike, some have expressed fury at problems contacting the airline.
