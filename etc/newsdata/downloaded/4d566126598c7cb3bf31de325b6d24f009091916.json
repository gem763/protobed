Kipchoge was also aided by 41 pacemakers, most of them medal holders from athletics World championships or from the Olympics.\n\nAhead of its record-breaking attempt, Kipchoge said that \"to have a legitimate chance of breaking the two-hour barrier is really simple. It's actually believing and accepting that you can do it.\"\n\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations has congratulated Kipchoge for his achievement.", "description": "Kipchoge, the world marathon record holder, will be hoping to be second time lucky after he narrowly failed in his first try in 2017 by running the length of a marathon in 2:00:25.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/54/58/1000x563_cmsv2_cd6d5196-be3e-59f0-8784-0f8947473eae-4225458.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
