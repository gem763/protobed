Council enacts emergency legislation allowing students to receive medical marijuana", "language": "en", "text": "The D.C. Council on Tuesday enacted emergency legislation to allow students to receive medical marijuana at their elementary or high school and approved a bill to ban e-cigarettes amid ever-increasing reports of vaping-related illnesses and deaths around the country.\n\nCouncil member David Grosso introduced the emergency legislation to authorize primary and secondary school students participating in the District\u2019s medical marijuana program to receive their medication at school.\n\n\u201cNo student should have to choose between attending school or receiving effective treatment for a medical condition,\u201d said Mr. Grosso, at-large independent.\n\nCurrent law restricts the use of medical marijuana to residents or to a medical treatment facility. Many schools don\u2019t have such facilities and therefore do not allow students to use the medication at school.\n\nThe legislation allows medical marijuana to be treated like any other medication in schools and be administered in the nurse\u2019s office.\n\nNearly all of the council\u2019s 13 members voted to enact the emergency bill, with only Trayon White, Ward 8 Democrat, voting \u201cpresent.\u201d\n\nEmergency legislation takes effect immediately without the mayor\u2019s signature and remains in effect for 90 days.\n\nThe council also approved temporary legislation on the issue that bypasses committee assignment and will receive a second vote from lawmakers. It must be signed by the mayor and approved by Congress, and remains in effect for no more than 225 days.\n\nIn addition, council members Mary Cheh and Vincent Gray each introduced legislation aimed at preventing further addiction of nicotine in the District.\n\n\u201cWhat I am most concerned about is that we are quite literally watching a new generation of young people get hooked on nicotine through vaping,\u201d Mr. Gray, Ward 7 Democrat, said as he introduced the Prohibition of Electronic Smoking Sales Without a Prescription Act of 2019.\n\nHis legislation would require that electronic cigarettes and vaping products be sold in pharmacies only to persons with a prescription to use them.\n\nMrs. Cheh\u2019s bill \u2014 the Flavored Electronic Smoking Device Prohibition Amendment Act of 2019 \u2014 would prohibit the sale or distribution of any flavored electronic smoking devices and products.\n\n\u201cOver the past few years, e-cigarette use has exploded among young people and continues to rise at an exponential pace,\u201d Ms. Cheh, Ward 3 Democrat, said in a statement. \u201cThe e-cigarette industry has built this youth market by targeting children through advertising and widely available flavored products \u2014 taking a note from the playbook of the closely-aligned tobacco industry.\u201d\n\nMr. Gray said that as chairman of the Health Committee, he would hold a hearing on both pieces of e-cigarette legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, the lawmakers voted almost unanimously to approve the Subpoena Enforcement Resolution of 2019. It authorizes the council\u2019s general counsel to file a petition in D.C. Superior Court to compel witnesses under penalty of contempt to comply with subpoenas from the law firm investigating council member Jack Evans.\n\nMr. Evans, Ward 2 Democrat, was the only member to vote against the resolution, citing his previous opposition to the probe.\n\nCouncil Chairman Phil Mendelson, at-large Democrat, said Monday that only one of six people who have received subpoenas is complying in the council\u2019s code of conduct investigation. He said Tuesday that more interviews have been scheduled.\n\nCouncil member Elissa Silverman, at-large independent, raised concern that the law firm tasked with conducting the probe, O\u2019Melveny & Myers, wasn\u2019t interviewing enough people, given the number of documents being reviewed (more than 100,000) and the scope of the investigation (from 2014 to the present).\n\nMr. Mendelson said he had spoken with the law firm and is confident its probe will be thorough.\n\nHe said he will announce who will serve on the ad hoc committee to review the investigation at the council\u2019s Oct. 8 meeting.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
