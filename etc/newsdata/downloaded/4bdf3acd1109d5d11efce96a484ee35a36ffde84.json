I think everyone\u2019s going to love watching these celebrities because it\u2019s not what people expect.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Some of them are really good. The show feels more exciting. There\u2019s no Bootcamp, no Six-Chair Challenge, it feels slick this year.\n\nFormer Love Island stars Wes Nelson, Zara McDermott, Eyal Booker and Samira Mighty will take part as band The Islanders (Picture: ITV)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been the best show on TV for a long time and has just had a little rebranding, I suppose, a new X Factor.\u2019\n\nThe music manager joins Simon Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger on the judges\u2019 panel.\n\nA new trailer for the show saw Simon, Nicole and Louis listening to the celebs do their thing in a luxury Hollywood venue, which we think is a fair replacement for judges\u2019 houses.\n\nReality star Megan McKenna, Glee\u2019s Kevin McHale, EastEnders\u2019 Jonny Labey will all be competing in the Unders category. The Overs is comprised of journalist Martin Bashir, actress Victoria Ekanoye and talk show host Ricki Lake.\n\nIn the groups will be a Love Island supergroup comprised of Wes Nelson, Samira Mighty, Eyal Booker and Zara McDermott. Ben Foden, Thom Evans and Levi Davis will be teaming up for a group, along with Brendan Cole and Jeremy Edwards.\n\nMegan was recently spotted welcoming Louis to her home as the pair filmed scenes for the show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven how happy the pair looked it\u2019s safe to assume that the Towie star\u2019s time on the show is going well.\n\nThe X Factor Celebrity starts Saturday 12 October at 8.35pm.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
