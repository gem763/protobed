We must not allow that to happen,\u201d Gurria said.\n\nThe OECD said the suggestions would be formally presented at a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington on October 17 and 18.\n\nFrance has vowed it will scrap its digital tax once a new international levy is in place.\n\nIn September, Google agreed a settlement totalling around $1 billion to end a tax dispute in France after similar settlements in Italy and Britain.\n\nGoogle, like several other big American tech companies, has its European headquarters in Ireland, where the government has set the corporate tax rate at just 12.5 percent in a bid to attract big companies.\n\nAmazon, whose European headquarters is in Luxembourg, another low-tax jurisdiction, said called the OECD\u2019s latest proposal \u201can important step forward\u201d.\n\n\u201cReaching broad international agreement on changes to fundamental international tax principles is critical to limit the risk of double taxation and distortive unilateral measures,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nAmazon had warned in August that it would pass on the costs of France\u2019s new digital tax to firms which use its Marketplace platform for reaching consumers, intsead of taking the hit itself.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 The OECD published Wednesday its suggestions for a \u201cunified approach\u201d on fairly taxing digital giants to break a deadlock", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/cce8e2_digital-firms-exposed-weak-spots-in-international-tax-rules-letting-pay-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
