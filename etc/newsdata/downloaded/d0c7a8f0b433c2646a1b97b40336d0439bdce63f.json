The American people, when they think about this are going to be totally outraged, they actually want to impeach him on the testimony of hidden witnesses who will be behind a curtain. We don't know who they are. I went back to read two books about the Salem witch trials,\" said the former New York City mayor.\n\nGiuliani asserted the accused witches \"had more rights\" in their trials because \"they required witnesses to face the witch and some witches were acquitted \u2014 it\u2019s ridiculous. You got to go back before the Magna Carta. The only place I think where we had trials like this is the Soviet Union.\"\n\nGiuliani further called the impeachment inquiry \"so stupid, it\u2019s neanderthal.\"\n\nHouse Democrats are considering taking extra steps to hide the whistleblower's identify in order to secure their testimony. Ideas being floated around include having them testify from a remote location via video and obscuring their appearance and voice, having them sit behind a screen, or conducting an audio-only testimony.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi are hell-bent on conducting their impeachment inquiry behind closed doors. Taxpayers deserve transparency throughout the impeachment process,\" a congressional official who is working on the impeachment inquiry told Townhall. \"It\u2019s only fair that President Trump and the American people get to face the President\u2019s accuser.\"\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/09/2019 14:28:08PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Timothy Meads", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/282/7797589b-b121-4e3c-9288-5b3ae8a5daa8.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
