The official said confirmation that the ISIS chief was killed in an explosion is pending. No other details were available. The official was not authorized to discuss the strike and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump teased a major announcement, tweeting Saturday night that \"Something very big has just happened!\" A White House spokesperson, Hogan Gidley, would say only that the president would be making a \"major statement\" at 9 a.m. ET Sunday.\n\nIf confirmed, the operation's success could prove a major boost for Trump. The recent pullback of U.S. troops he ordered from northeastern Syria raised a storm of bipartisan criticism in Washington that the militant group could regain strength, after it had lost vast stretches of territory it had once controlled.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Syria war monitor, reported an attack carried out by a squadron of eight helicopters accompanied by a warplane belonging to the international coalition on positions of the Hurras al-Deen, an al-Qaeda-linked group, in the Barisha area north of Idlib city, after midnight on Saturday. ISIS operatives are believed to be hiding in the area, it said.\n\nSyrians ride a motorcycle past a burnt vehicle near the site where helicopter gunfire reportedly killed nine people near the northwestern Syrian village of Barisha in Idlib province, along the border with Turkey, where 'groups linked to the Islamic State group' were present, according to a Britain-based war monitor with sources inside Syria. The helicopters targeted a home and a car on the outskirts of Barisha, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. (Omar Haj Kadour/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt said the helicopters targeted ISIS positions with heavy strikes for about 120 minutes, during which jihadists fired at the aircraft with heavy weapons. The Britain-based Observatory, which operates through a network of activists on the ground, documented the death of nine people as a result of the coalition helicopter attack. It is not yet known whether al-Baghdadi is one of them, it said, adding that the death toll is likely to rise due to the large number of wounded.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's presence in the village, which is a few kilometres away from the Turkish border, would come as a surprise, even if some ISIS leaders are believed to have fled to Idlib after losing their last sliver of territory in Syria to U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in March. The surrounding areas are largely controlled by a rival of the Islamic State group \u2014 the al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2014 although other jihadi groups sympathetic to ISIS operate there. Unverified video circulated online by Syrian groups appeared to support the Observatory claim that the operation occurred in Barisha.\n\nThe intelligence source on the militant leader's whereabouts could not be immediately confirmed, but both Iraqi and Kurdish officials claimed a role. The Turkish military also Tweeted that prior to the operation in Idlib, it exchanged \"information\" and co-ordinated with U.S. military authorities.\n\nKurdish forces appeared ready to portray al-Baghdadi's death as a joint victory for their faltering alliance with the U.S., weeks after Trump ordered American forces to withdraw from northeastern Syria, all but abandoning Washington's allies to a wide-ranging Turkish assault.\n\nThe commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, tweeted: \"Successful & historical operation due to a joint intelligence work with the United States of America.\"\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump is expected to make a 'major statement' at the White House on Sunday morning. (Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nA senior Iraqi security official told The Associated Press that Iraqi intelligence played a part in the operation.Al-Baghdadi and his wife both detonated explosive vests they were wearing during the U.S. commando operation, he said.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was divulging sensitive information. He added that other ISIS leaders were killed in the attack.\n\nAl-Baghdadi has led ISIS for the last five years, presiding over its ascendancy as it cultivated a reputation for beheadings and attracted hundreds of thousands of followers to a sprawling and self-styled caliphate in Iraq and Syria. He remained among the few ISIS commanders still at large despite multiple claims in recent years about his death and even as his so-called caliphate dramatically shrank, with many supporters who joined the cause either imprisoned or jailed.\n\nHis exhortations were instrumental in inspiring terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe and in the United States. Shifting away from the airline hijackings and other mass-casualty attacks that came to define al-Qaeda, al-Baghdadi and other ISIS leaders supported smaller-scale acts of violence that would be harder for law enforcement to prepare for and prevent.\n\nThey encouraged jihadists who could not travel to the caliphate to kill where they were, with whatever weapon they had at their disposal. In the U.S., multiple extremists have pledged their allegiance to al-Baghdadi on social media, including a woman who along with her husband committed a 2015 massacre at a holiday party in San Bernardino, California.\n\nWith a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head, al-Baghdadi has been far less visible in recent years, releasing only sporadic audio recordings, including one just last month in which he called on members of the extremist group to do all they could to free ISIS detainees and women held in jails and camps.\n\nThe purported audio was his first public statement since last April, when he appeared in a video for the first time in five years.\n\nIn 2014, he was a black-robed figure delivering a sermon from the pulpit of Mosul's Great Mosque of al-Nuri, his only known public appearance. He urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.\n\n\"It is a burden to accept this responsibility to be in charge of you,\" he said in the video. \"I am not better than you or more virtuous than you. If you see me on the right path, help me. If you see me on the wrong path, advise me and halt me. And obey me as far as I obey God.\"\n\nThough at minimum a symbolic victory for Western counterterrorism efforts, his death would have unknown practical impact on possible future attacks. He had been largely regarded as a symbolic figurehead of the global terror network, and was described as \"irrelevant for a long time\" by a coalition spokesman in 2017.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai in 1971 in Samarra, Iraq, and adopted his nom de guerre early on. Because of anti-U.S. militant activity, he was detained by U.S. forces in Iraq and sent to Bucca prison in February 2004, according to ISIS-affiliated websites.\n\nHe was released 10 months later, after which he joined the al-Qaeda branch in Iraq of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. He later assumed control of the group, known at the time as the Islamic State of Iraq.\n\nAfter Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, al-Baghdadi set about pursuing a plan for a medieval-style Islamic State, or caliphate. He merged a group known as the Nusra Front, which initially welcomed moderate Sunni rebels who were part of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad, with a new one known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Al-Qaeda's central leadership refused to accept the takeover and broke with al-Baghdadi.\n\nAl-Baghdadi's fighters captured a contiguous stretch of territory across Iraq and Syria, including key cities, and in June 2014, it announced its own state \u2014 or caliphate. Al-Baghdadi became the declared caliph of the newly renamed Islamic State group. Under his leadership, the group became known for macabre massacres and beheadings \u2014often posted online on militant websites \u2014 and a strict adherence to an extreme interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nOver the years, he has been reported multiple times to have been killed, but none has been confirmed. In 2017, Russian officials said there was a \"high probability\" he had been killed in a Russian airstrike on the outskirts of Raqqa, but U.S. officials later said they believed he was still alive.", "description": "Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the shadowy leader of the Islamic State group who presided over its global jihad and became arguably the world's most wanted man, is believed dead after being targeted by a U.S. military raid in Syria.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5115765.1556567293!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
