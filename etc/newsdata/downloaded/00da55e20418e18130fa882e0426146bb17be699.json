But their message couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\n\nDiane and Kathy wanted me to know that I wasn\u2019t alone. No doubt, that was something I needed to hear right then. During the weeks leading up to that day, I\u2019d been sued because I had declined on behalf of my print shop, Hands On Originals, to print shirts with messages that violate my faith.\n\nAlong with the lawsuit itself, there was plenty of negative publicity directed my way. Even my city\u2019s mayor had voiced his opposition to me, and my relationship with some of my regular customers was suddenly strained. It was a difficult season. I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone, and Diane and Kathy wanted me to know they wouldn\u2019t either.\n\nKELLY SHACKELFORD: SUPREME COURT PEACE CROSS DECISION IS A MAJOR VICTORY FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\nBut there was another reason Diane and Kathy reached out to me, and why they\u2019ve publicly advocated for me since. They understood that, even though we may not see eye to eye on any number of issues, our freedoms travel together. After all, if I can be forced to violate my conscience at my print shop, who\u2019s to say that they won\u2019t be next?\n\nLike Diane and Kathy\u2019s business, Hands On Originals is a promotional printing company. We\u2019ll work with anyone, regardless of who they are or what belief system they have. But we don\u2019t print all messages.\n\nIn fact, from 2010 to 2012, we declined over a dozen orders because of the messages we were asked to print, including a couple from area churches \u2014 one of which depicted Jesus sitting in a bucket of chicken. I know it was a lighthearted message, but at the end of the day, I felt that it was disrespectful to my Savior.\n\nIn early March 2012 \u2014 a few weeks before Diane and Kathy contacted me \u2014 I spoke with a customer who wanted shirts promoting a local gay pride festival that summer. As the customer told me the design and wording he had in mind, it became clear to me that we weren\u2019t going to be able to print those shirts. But as I told him at the time, I wanted to make sure he was taken care of, so I offered to send his order to a company I knew would print the shirts for the same price I would have charged.\n\nHands On Originals is a promotional printing company. We\u2019ll work with anyone, regardless of who they are or what belief system they have. But we don\u2019t print all messages.\n\nInstead of accepting my offer, the group organizing the Pride festival filed a complaint with the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission. The complaint from the group \u2014 which ended up getting its shirts printed by another print shop free of charge \u2014 accused me of refusing to work with LGBT customers.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. Again, I work with all people, no matter who they are. I both serve and employ gay people. In fact, we\u2019ve printed materials for a lesbian musician who played at that very same Pride festival.\n\nBut none of this has stopped the government from pursuing its case against me. I and my Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys have spent the past seven-plus years in and out of court as I defend myself against a government that is bent on forcing me to print messages that violate my faith.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMy latest stop was the Kentucky Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in my case on Aug. 23. If the government has its way, I will be required to print messages that violate my faith.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard for me to even imagine it, that could force me to have to choose between following my faith and continuing the promotional work that I love \u2014 a career that for decades has provided not only for my family but also for the families of the more than 30 people we employ from diverse backgrounds.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPeople don\u2019t surrender their freedom of speech when they choose to make a living by printing messages. That\u2019s clear to me. It\u2019s clear to Diane and Kathy, who have supported me because they understand that it\u2019s not just my freedom at stake, but theirs too. And it should have been clear to the government as well.\n\nThe Kentucky Supreme Court now has the chance to make that clear to everyone. If it does, it can ensure that business owners who serve everyone, like I do, are not forced to print messages that violate their beliefs. That\u2019s a message Diane, Kathy, and I \u2014 and countless others who make speech for a living \u2014 would sure like to hear.", "description": "I am trying to defend myself against a government that is bent on forcing me to print messages that violate my faith.", "authors": ["Blaine Adamson"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/08/Blaine-Adamson-Hands-On-Originals.jpg"}
