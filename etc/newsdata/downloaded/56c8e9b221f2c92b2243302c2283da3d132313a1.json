A true anti-gun crusade starts a la Australia and New Zealand, by taking weapons that are already in circulation off the streets.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d be keen to see a test vote on mandatory buybacks in the House, in fact, as I\u2019m not sure Dems could pass a bill like that there even with their current majority. The freshmen who ousted Republicans in purple districts last fall would panic, caught in a vise between progressives who want aggressive action and Republican voters who are suspicious of their \u201cmoderate\u201d credentials. For just that reason, I assume there\u2019s nothing that could convince Pelosi to put such a bill on the floor, no matter how good it might make lefties feel to get everyone on record.\n\nIf you believe WaPo\u2019s latest polling, a majority of the country now supports a buyback program, i.e. confiscation, of assault weapons:\n\nSupposedly 31 percent of Republicans are on board with a buyback. But note: When Quinnipiac recently polled the idea, it found a mere 18 percent of Republicans in favor and the public split 46/49 against it overall. A new poll from Monmouth out within the last hour finds support for buybacks at just 43/53 nationally and 22/74 among Republicans.\n\nWe could sit here and speculate about why, analyzing the partisan samples in each polls or the wording of the question, but it\u2019s not worth the bother. A buyback isn\u2019t happening anytime soon; beyond its cheap stump-speech value to 2020 Dem hopefuls, it\u2019s useful to gun-grabbers chiefly as a way to try to condition the public to accept less aggressive gun-control measures as \u201ccompromise\u201d ideas. Right now, according to WaPo, 56 percent of Americans support an assault-weapons ban, including 33 percent of Republicans. (Quinnipiac actually had GOP support at 37 percent.) If Democrats start negotiations in 2021 with a big \u201cask\u201d \u2014 mandatory buyback! \u2014 it\u2019ll seem less unreasonable to some righties when they \u201cretreat\u201d and offer a ban on future assault-weapons sales instead.\n\nIt may play out the same way on health care, with the next Democratic administration \u201csettling\u201d for adding a public option to ObamaCare after preparing the political battlespace with years of chatter about Medicare for All.\n\nAs for Beto\u2019s point here that police wouldn\u2019t go door to door to enforce his buyback program, doubtless that\u2019s true. Cops don\u2019t have the resources to conduct house to house searches of literally everyone, never mind the danger they\u2019d face when they inevitably encountered people who adamantly refuse to turn over their weapons. The way this would be enforced, I assume, is the way drug-possession laws are enforced: The cops aren\u2019t going to knock on the door randomly and ask to look around to see if you have drugs, but if they\u2019re searching your property for some other reason and discover drugs, you\u2019re in trouble. Same with assault weapons. President Beto could offer people a certain amount of compensation if they want to hand in their weapons voluntarily and, if they don\u2019t, threaten them with a 10-year prison sentence should those weapons be found in the course of other police business. Most guns would remain in circulation (just like in New Zealand!) but they couldn\u2019t be brought to ranges or gun shows anymore without fear of arrest. They\u2019d be contraband.", "description": "\"I don't see the law enforcement going door to door.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bo-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
