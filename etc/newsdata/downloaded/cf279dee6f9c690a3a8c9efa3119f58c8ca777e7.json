That night diGenova appeared on Tucker\u2019s show and called Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d for believing that. The next day Shep used a minute of his own show to scold diGenova and Tucker, calling it \u201crepugnant\u201d that one Fox guest would denigrate the professional opinion of a Fox contributor. Tucker doubled down by bringing diGenova back on his show that night and all but calling Shep a liberal hack. Reportedly Fox execs intervened at that point, warning Shep not to hit back again. But the damage was done: The simmering feud between Fox\u2019s Trump-skeptic news division and its Trump-admiring opinion division was now boiling after the prospect of impeachment had turned up the heat.\n\nIt looked like things had begun to cool down after Fox management stepped in \u2014 until this morning, when Chris Wallace pulled the pin on this grenade and lobbed it.\n\nBreaking news on FOX News Sunday: Chris reports Rudy Giuliani did not act alone in trying to get dirt from Ukraine on Joe Biden\u2026 and much more. Then\u2013 Kevin Corke discusses further information on the Trump whistleblower complaint and the Democrat's push for impeachment. pic.twitter.com/OpGRMArMHz \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 29, 2019\n\nAccording to Wallace, diGenova is working with Giuliani on the Biden business with Ukraine. The guy whom Tucker invited on as some sort of dispassionate legal analyst to counter Napolitano turns out to be a secret participant in the matter that\u2019s being analyzed, Trump\u2019s interactions with Zelensky and his government. I didn\u2019t see the first Tucker segment with diGenova but you can watch the second here. He\u2019s introduced merely as a former U.S. Attorney, and Carlson prefaces their conversation by noting that legal opinion is split on the point about a \u201cthing of value\u201d that Napolitano had made. In other words, diGenova was presented to the audience as nothing more or less than a seasoned lawyer whose acumen led him to a different opinion than Judge Nap\u2019s. Tucker even laughed at one point at Shep\u2019s claim that diGenova is a \u201cpartisan.\u201d\n\nNow here comes Wallace to imply that the entire segment was basically a fraud, with diGenova concealing a glaring conflict of interest.\n\nThe news division just pantsed the opinion division, in other words. And they did it in a way that cuts to the heart of the criticism of Fox primetime over the past two and a half years, that it\u2019s so deep in the tank for Trump that it\u2019s hard to tell if its employees are working for the network or for the president. In this case, unbeknownst to the audience, one key guest was quite literally working for the president, Wallace claims.\n\nDid Tucker know and conceal the information? Presumably he was in the dark, but he\u2019s a buddy of Trump\u2019s and has been known to talk foreign policy with him by phone. Did Trump ever idly mention to him that Rudy *and Joe diGenova* are working on the Ukraine thing? Also: Did Fox executives know of diGenova\u2019s role? If so, why did they conceal the conflict of interest? If not, will there be any sanction against diGenova for not disclosing his involvement in the Ukraine stuff before appearing on a segment to comment on it?\n\nRelatedly, who greenlit this on-air revelation by Wallace? It\u2019s to Fox\u2019s credit that they allowed it to be reported knowing the questions it would raise about diGenova\u2019s segments this week and his role on the network going forward, but I\u2019m surprised that they allowed it to be done in such a showy way. They could have relegated it to a story on the Fox News website and then quietly warned Tucker not to have him back on, or at least to be forthright about disclosing his role in the Ukraine matter next time.\n\nOne more: Will Shep be allowed to mention this on air tomorrow?\n\nIn lieu of an exit question, here\u2019s the latest punch-up on Fox News between news and opinion.
