She was just wearing her favorite high jump shoes.\n\nShe has worn the shoes, with a rainbow flap across one foot to symbolize gay pride, all season. She didn\u2019t consider how that would be taken in Qatar, a conservative Muslim nation, where homosexual acts are illegal.\n\nBy slipping on the high-jump shoes Wednesday night, she stepped into a touchy subject that organizers for the track world championships and the 2022 World Cup here have tried to avoid.\n\nIAAF president Sebastian Coe ducked the issue when asked about anti-LGBTQ laws on the eve of the championships. Dahlan Al Hammad, the head of the local organizing committee, said Qatar would comply with international laws.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He put out a statement last week saying he would respect the laws of the host country and make no political statements while he was there to compete. He races Friday.\n\nBougard started dating her girlfriend about a year ago and wants to be an advocate for people struggling with sexual identity.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have a voice, us as athletes, because more people look at us to perform,\u201d said the 26-year-old who competed at Mississippi State. \u201cIt\u2019s important because I feel like people hate people for loving who they love. Some people don\u2019t believe in it, which is totally fine. I wanted to show my side and put the symbol on my shoe.\u201d\n\nBougard wasn\u2019t concerned about any sort of fallout after completing the first four of seven heptathlon events in a competition spread out over two days. In fourth place going into Day 2 on Thursday, she\u2019s in striking distance of a medal as she trails teammate Kendell Williams by two points. The long jump, javelin and 800-meter run remain.\n\n\u201cHopefully I do get a lot of praise (on social media),\u201d Bougard said. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t get bashed a lot.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s glad people took notice.\n\n\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think about it because it was already on my shoe,\u201d she said. \u201cI put the flag on my shoe and people noticed it, I guess.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "American heptathlete Erica Bougard says she wasn\u2019t trying to make an international political statement against Qatar\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies.", "authors": ["Pat Graham"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19275577619824.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C15px%2C3110px%2C1628px&resize=1200%2C628&strip"}
