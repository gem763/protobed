It is still not where they want to be \u2013 but Arsenal did enough, ultimately, to warrant a point from a thud-and-blunder evening that demonstrated how far these old rivals have to go before they can harbour realistic title ambitions. On this evidence it is going to be a long way back. Scott McTominay did score a peach of a goal for United but, last season included, the difficult truth for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is that his team have not managed more than one goal in 11 of their last 12 league fixtures.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r backs his players despite worst start in 30 years Read more\n\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang supplied Arsenal\u2019s equaliser after VAR had overturned a rotten offside decision and, points-wise, it is the first time since the 1989-90 season that United have not reached double figures from their first seven games. That is the same season, it may be recalled, that Old Trafford chanted for Bryan Robson to take over and a banner appeared in the stands calling for Alex Ferguson, then just a plain old Mister, to be removed from office.\n\nThis time the crowd is nothing like as grumpy. The weather is still the same, of course, although it would probably be a bit too generous on the two sets of players to blame the near-unremitting Mancunian downpour for their inability to pass the ball more stylishly. It was an accident-prone evening, littered with clumsiness, and it told a clear story about why these sides are already playing catch-up to Liverpool and Manchester City in the top two positions. Nobody should realistically expect them to win that chase.\n\nNot that the lack of real quality \u2013 and it was startling at times \u2013 stopped the game from burning slowly into an entertaining contest. The first half, in truth, was a bit of a stinker. Or at least it was until McTominay grew weary of the torpor and, 20 yards out, smacked in a firecracker of a shot. After that, however, there was lots of drama and incident at either end, not least the equalising goal when Aubameyang was initially judged to be offside in the moments before he flicked the ball over David de Gea.\n\nIt turned out to be a particularly poor judgment from a trigger-happy linesman and possibly the easiest VAR decision yet. Harry Maguire had been playing Aubameyang onside by some distance. United did have a reasonable argument De Gea would have made more of an effort to block the shot had he not seen the raised flag.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scott McTominay fires in the opening goal just before half-time.

Arsenal looked vulnerable as soon as their opponents started streaming out of their own penalty area. In a rare moment of nostalgia, United had managed to turn defence into attack in a few seconds. Daniel James could not produce a telling cross but Marcus Rashford chased the ball towards the corner flag and then cut it back for McTominay to let fly. He struck the ball beautifully and the shot was still rising as it hit the net.\n\nMcTominay, though, must also feel he could have won the match, at 1-1, when he had a golden opportunity to score from a header.\n\nUntil his goal the first half had been a grind. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 put Arsenal\u2019s first real chance into the Stretford End when he had more time than he probably realised. Andreas Pereira tried to liven up proceedings with a shot that Bernd Leno saved down to his left.\n\nManchester United 1-1 Arsenal: Premier League player ratings Read more\n\nThe away end chanted for VAR after a cross thudded into McTominay\u2019s chest. The rain fell hard on a humdrum game. And at that stage United\u2019s best hope appeared to be high ball into the penalty area and someone getting on the end of one of Maguire\u2019s knockdowns. It was poor in the extreme and, unfortunately for Granit Xhaka, his first game since being named as Arsenal\u2019s full-time captain contained an element of tragicomedy.\n\nFor Example A, consider his ability, at 0-0, to make a pig\u2019s ear from a free-kick in a promising position. More damagingly for Arsenal, however, Xhaka was also culpable of ducking out of the way of McTominay\u2019s shot. The only possible mitigation was the ball took a tiny nick off another Arsenal player. Xhaka\u2019s head was down, his eyes fixed on the floor, and the ball was spearing into the roof of the net.\n\nIt was the kind of moment that might wake Tony Adams, Martin Keown et al during the early hours in a cold sweat. And fitting, perhaps, for a night that left one pining for the days when this game was the biggest occasion in England\u2019s top division.", "description": "Scott McTominay gave Manchester United the lead just before half-time but Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalised after VAR overruled an offside flag", "authors": ["Daniel Taylor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df997a345dd042b067351d20403fcdf6aaa9b43d/24_117_3503_2102/master/3503.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d118ffd4a87d9c03377a6e6c6cab8b0", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
