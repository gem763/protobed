Well buddy, do I have news for you.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Thursday that he would be joining forces with Cam to try and get more young people to take up a trade.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not sure how many young people know who Scott Cam is or care what he has to say, but it\u2019s a nice gesture all the same and helps tap into the Coalition government\u2019s continuing mantra that everything is fine and will continue being fine as long as we don\u2019t change anything (remember the \u201990s?!)\n\nThe Gold Logie winner will be the first \u201cnational careers ambassador\u201d in Australia\u2019s history, working to show young Aussies how practical and technical training can end in lucrative careers. Hell, maybe you\u2019ll even get your own reality show.\n\n\u201cScott Cam is proof that undertaking a trade can be a very valuable, rewarding and successful career choice, and there are plenty more who can tell a similar story to Scott,\u201d said Morrison.\n\n\u201cBy learning a trade you\u2019ll earn more, your skills will be in demand, and you\u2019ll help build our country and keep our economy strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see more Australians become plumbers, electricians and bakers than lawyers and consultants. I would like to see more of them going on to become their own boss.\u201d\n\nMichaelia Cash, employment and skills minister, said Cam will work with the National Careers Institute, but shied away from discussing how much the government was coughing up to employ the country\u2019s most famous \u201ctradie.\u201d\n\nMichaelia Cash says Scott Cam's salary is \"commercial in confidence\" but the role is \"about outcomes\". She hasn't named any outcomes yet except young people looking up to him because it shows tradies can do anything. #auspol \u2014 Paul Karp (@Paul_Karp) October 9, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s definitely an interesting move from a Coalition government that has routinely made budget cuts to the more traditional ways of helping kids out, all but ignoring TAFE in the latest budget, having 140,000 fewer apprentices then when it was elected, and cutting $3 billion from vocational education.\n\nIn April, the Australian Education Union\u2019s federal president Correna Haythorpe accused the Morrison government of having an agenda of privatising vocational education in Australia. The chief executive of the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia, Troy Williams, told the AFR the government\u2019s spending priorities were confused.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the employment of Scotty Cam helps clear a few things up.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-487057317.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
