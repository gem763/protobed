Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!\u201d\n\n....Other aspects of the deal are also great - technology, financial services, 16-20 Billion in Boeing Planes etc., but WOW, the Farmers really hit pay dirt! @ChuckGrassley@joniernst@debfisher@BenSasse Thank you to all Republicans in Congress for your invaluable help! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2019\n\nTrade delegations from the US and China reached a \u201cvery substantial phase one\u201d deal on Friday, covering intellectual property, financial services, and agricultural products. While the actual agreement may take several weeks to finalize, planned tariff increases on Chinese goods have been shelved, and Beijing has agreed to buy between $40 billion and $50 billion worth of American agricultural goods.\n\nAmerican farmers had seen Chinese demand for their pork, soybeans, and cotton plummet during the Trump administration\u2019s tit-for-tat trade war with Beijing. If China sticks to the new deal, its spending on American agricultural produce will increase twofold, from the $19.5 billion it spent in 2017. That Trump would take a victory lap is no surprise, given rural Americans make up much of his support base.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump needs ongoing drama to finally cut deal with China & portray it as a great victory, Prof. Wolff tells Boom Bust\n\nMuch remains to be discussed as the two countries enter the second phase of negotiations. Washington and Beijing have yet to come to an agreement on transfer of technology, and on the Trump administration\u2019s blacklisting of several Chinese companies, among them smartphone and 5G giant Huawei.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
