Howard Schultz had announced to great fanfare in January that he would explore the idea of an independent run at the presidency, only to disappear from the political scene like a light-roast skinny decaf with soy. Today, however, Schultz has awoken from his prolonged nappuccino to exit the 2020 sweepstakes:\n\nHoward Shultz, the former Starbucks CEO who had been weighing an independent presidential bid, announced Friday that he will not run for president. \u201cMy belief in the need to reform our two-party system has not wavered, but I have concluded that an independent campaign for the White House is not how I can best serve our country at this time,\u201d Schultz said in statement. Schultz added that the money he would have allocated to a campaign \u201cwill instead be used to invest in people, organizations and ideas that promote honesty, civility and results in our politics, and that move the country beyond two-party gridlock.\u201d\n\nHardest hit: Donald Trump. Schultz had bragged earlier this year that an independent run would soak up so much of Trump\u2019s moderate voting support that the incumbent would be left with only 28% of the vote, tops. Trump, who knew better, responded by attempting the rare immediate jump to the triple-dog-dare:\n\nHoward Schultz doesn\u2019t have the \u201cguts\u201d to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the \u201csmartest person.\u201d Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2019\n\nIf Schultz had run, he would have pulled most of his votes away from the Democrats. His appeal to Trump skeptics and \u201cmoderates\u201d wouldn\u2019t have found much traction with voters who might not like Trump\u2019s antics but support the policies he\u2019s pursuing. Schultz might have lowered Trump\u2019s floor to 42-45%, but in a serious three-way race with a multibillionaire independent, that would probably have been more than enough to win. Just ask Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush.\n\nAnyway, one has to wonder what took Schultz so long to make this decision \u2014 and why he bothered to make an announcement at all. It\u2019s been months since anyone heard from him, and people stopped asking about him before the summer started. He had earlier promised to make a decision by June, but that deadline came and went without anyone noticing. What\u2019s the point of making this declaration now? Schultz would have been better off pulling a Garbo than making this weak claim that he\u2019s going to fight against two-party gridlock by, er, not putting his own rear end on the line to fight it. Stick to the latt\u00e9s, pal.", "description": "\u201cMy belief in the need to reform our two-party system has not wavered...\"", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/schultz.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
