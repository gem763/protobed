It would've been about the Long Night, the Starks and the White Walkers, and we literally just had all that in GoT. The Targaryen Conquest is much more interesting. #HouseOfTheDragon \u2014 Matt-o'-lantern \ud83c\udf83 (@matthewjmartin_) October 30, 2019\n\nWhat was the series about? The official synopsis read, \u201cThe series chronicles the world\u2019s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros\u2019 history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend\u2026 it\u2019s not the story we think we know.\u201d\n\nDo you think HBO took the right decision?
