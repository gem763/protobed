A small fraction of people get much sicker, and can suffer complications like pneumonia and brain swelling.\n\nOnce common, the disease is now rare since the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine was introduced in 1963.\n\nThe CDC recommends children receive the first dose at 12 to 15 months old and the second dose at four to six years old.\n\nThe vaccine is about 97 percent effective. But those who are unvaccinated have a 90 percent chance of catching measles if they breathe the virus in, according to the CDC.\n\nBefore the measles vaccine was available, more than 500,000 cases were diagnosed in the US every year, with about 500 annual deaths.", "description": "Health officials recorded seven new cases of measles in the US last week, bringing the nation's total number of cases this year to 1,250, in the country's worst outbreak since 1992.", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/21/19411932-0-image-a-19_1570478552855.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
