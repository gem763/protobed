We simply could not operate that way,\u201d Silver said in a statement before the press conference.\n\nThe NBA has found itself squeezed between Chinese anger, and criticism from US presidential candidates, influential senators, and fans over initial statements by the league seen as kowtowing to authoritarian China.\n\nSilver plans to travel to Shanghai on Wednesday for a pair of NBA exhibition games in China between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, saying he hoped to meet with officials to discuss the impasse.\n\nBut while expressing \u201cregret\u201d that Morey\u2019s comments upset China, Silver said the league is \u201cnot apologising for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, China\u2019s Communist Party-controlled broadcaster announced that it had shelved plans to broadcast the two pre-season exhibition games in China and was considering more punishments.\n\n\u201cWe believe that any comments that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech,\u201d China Central Television (CCTV) said on its social media account.\n\nChinese Internet giant Tencent, which streams NBA games to hundreds of millions of fans in China each year, quickly followed suit.\n\nA number of Chinese actors and singers said they would boycott the two exhibition games.\n\nAn associated hashtag, \u201cSeveral stars quit NBA games\u201d, was the most-discussed on China\u2019s leading social media platform Weibo racking up hundreds of millions of \u201creads\u201d.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Biggest lesson\u2019 \u2013\n\nChina\u2019s government said Morey\u2019s tweet was \u201cwrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cHow can you have exchanges and cooperate with the Chinese side without understanding the (mindset of) the Chinese people. That\u2019s not going to work,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing.\n\nNets players, executives and NBA China officials were to appear at a publicity event at a Shanghai primary school on Tuesday afternoon, but the league abruptly cancelled it just two hours before it was to start, giving no explanation.\n\nSilver said the NBA \u201cso far\u201d had no plans to cancel other events in China.\n\nThe Global Times, a nationalist paper known for communicating the Communist Party\u2019s thinking to the world, issued a blunt warning to firms that speaking out on human rights and other issues sensitive to China would cost them market access.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that Morey\u2019s freedom is at the expense of (the) Rockets\u2019 huge commercial interests, which the team is unwilling to give up. It\u2019s a paradox with which Americans are grappling,\u201d the editorial said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest lesson which can be drawn from the matter is that entities that value commercial interests must make their members speak cautiously.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Extremely hot\u2019 \u2013\n\nSilver said that Yao Ming, the towering Chinese former Rockets star who now heads the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA), was \u201cextremely hot\u201d over the controversy.\n\n\u201cI am hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,\u201d Silver said.\n\n\u201cBut he is extremely hot at the moment and I understand it.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s initial statement on the row seemed to satisfy no one.\n\nAn English version said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s views had offended China.\n\nA Chinese-language version of the statement went further, saying the organisation was \u201cdeeply disappointed by the inappropriate remarks\u201d.\n\nIn the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Texan, called the initial statements an \u201cembarrassment.\u201d\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, accused the NBA of throwing Morey \u201cunder the bus\u201d to \u201cprotect (the) NBA\u2019s market access in China\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is bigger than just the @NBA. It\u2019s about #China\u2019s growing ability to restrict freedom of expression here in the US,\u201d he added in a series of tweets.", "description": "Tokyo (AFP) \u2013 The National Basketball Association won\u2019t gag its personnel or apologise over a team executive\u2019s tweet that ignited a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/746228_houston-rockets-star-james-harden-apologised-on-monday-comments-team-manager-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
