I was diagnosed with prostate cancer...coming up on the second anniversary.\n\n\"I'm in no pain or discomfort at the moment. I've changed what I eat, the way I live, cut out almost all alcohol apart from special occasions.\n\n\"I do physically feel a lot better. Psychologically it's different. There are ups and downs.\n\n\"The hormone treatment can make me feel weepy. 80% of the time I feel great.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nBill revealed that he used to go to the bottom of the garden and shout \"get lost\" to his cancer, but has now come to accept the illness as part of him.\n\nHe said: \"Western medicine has great benefits. I've had amazing treatment from The Royal Marsden hospital.\n\n\"I\u2019m going straight from here to there for another round of treatment and I feel remarkably better because of that.\n\n\"Usually it's lets fix that problem with treatment or an operation, which is necessary. At the same time maybe we can heal ourselves from within by changing the way we live and pyschologically.\n\n\"This illness is part of me.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nBill has filmed a Channel 4 documentary, Bill Turnbull: Staying Alive, following his life with the illness.\n\nThe former BBC Breakfast host said he is doing yoga, meditation and trying to keep smiling.\n\nHe said: \"I think it's all about, from the moment we wake up, to try and think positively. 'It's a lovely day outside'.\n\n\"Even if it's a horrible day. 'It's a part of nature and there's beauty to it in a sense'.\n\n\"We live in a fantastic world and we are part of that and must play our part to the fullest. Most days I can do that.\"\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBill has also tried cannabis oil, which contains the drug\u2019s legal CBD compound \u2013 but also its illegal psychoactive element, THC.\n\nHe added: \"The difficulty with cannabis is there is a lot of anecdotal evidence. Full-time scientific evidence is thin on the ground.\n\n\"I have tried it. The difficulty is getting the proportions right and knowing what to take. I take CBD every day and find it helpful.\"\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "The former BBC Breakfast presenter admitted he was in 'no pain or discomfort' but was having psychological 'ups and downs'", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv", "Bbc", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756213.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bill-Turnbull-heading-straight-from-This-Morning-for-prostate-cancer-treatment.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
