Hong Kong Protesters Could Face a Year in Jail for Wearing a Mask: SCMP\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong is expected to ban face masks for protesters on Friday in a bid to quell months of violent unrest, invoking emergency rule for the first time since the city came under Chinese control in 1997.\n\nViolators of the ban, which will incl exemptions, could get a jail term of as much as one year or a fine of HK$25,000 ($3,190), the South China Morning Post reported, citing people it didn\u2019t identify. The former British colony is also studying extending the detention period of suspects beyond 48 hours, given the manpower needed to handle the large volume of protest arrests, the Oriental Daily reported.\n\nHu Xijin, editor-in-chief of China\u2019s Global Times newspaper backed by the Communist Party, said in a tweet that Western countries shouldn\u2019t apply \u201cnasty double standards\u201d when reacting to the ban while noting that Canada and the U.S. state of New York were reported to have similar laws.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s strong demand in Hong Kong calling for anti-mask law,\u201d Hu said. \u201cMost of the violent activities in Hong Kong were committed by masked rioters.\u201d\n\nHong Kong to Enact Rare Emergency Rule for Mask Ban, Reports Say\n\nThe move is likely to trigger intense clashes this weekend, with protesters already calling for mass demonstrations to oppose the law. The face mask has become a symbol of resistance among protesters who fear retribution if they are identified: China has already applied pressure to businesses such as Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. to fire employees who have participated in demonstrations.\n\nPolice fired tear gas and pepper spray at protesters in the residential area of Tai Koo Thursday night as demonstrations erupted in 11 sites and shopping centers across the city following the reports, the SCMP said. There were also calls for a protest in the Central business district at 12:30 p.m. on Friday.\n\nFirst passed by the British government in 1922 to quell a seamen\u2019s strike in Hong Kong\u2019s harbor, the emergency law was last used by the colonial administration to help put down riots that rocked the trading hub in 1967. Denounced by protest leaders as a form of martial law, it could give the government greater leeway to arrest citizens, censor publications, shut off communications networks and search premises without warrants, among other measures.\n\nThe move would come shortly after a protester was shot in violent demonstrations that once again shook the city on Oct. 1, as President Xi Jinping celebrated 70 years of Communist party rule in Beijing. Hong Kong stocks briefly jumped on the reports in afternoon trade on Thursday, rapidly erasing an earlier decline.\n\nA spokesman for Chief Executive Carrie Lam\u2019s office wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment on the reports when reached by phone Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe law would be difficult to enforce, the Post reported, and could spur court challenges as a rights violation. One police inspector, who requested anonymity, told the Post that the move would stir up more trouble.\n\nIt could also fuel further international condemnation of Lam\u2019s government. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, called for the U.S. to stand up to China in Hong Kong. She also urged America to stop exports of police gear to the city and provide temporary protected status to its residents.\n\n\u201cGetting China right takes more than bellicose tweets coupled with fawning summits\u2014and more than uncoordinated and often counterproductive tariffs that burden ordinary Americans,\u201d she wrote in a Foreign Policy magazine opinion piece outlining her plan for addressing issues in the city.\n\n(Updates with reports of Thursday clashes in sixth paragraph)", "description": "Hong Kong\u00a0Protesters Could Face a Year in Jail for Wearing a Mask: SCMP", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEDAN0H2_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
