Then they realize it\u2019s actually a fully functioning phone with all the capabilities and features. I have to school them every time. But once I do, they kind of fall in love with the idea and ask me how they can get one. I\u2019m definitely the guy with the green bubble in the group chat. But you have to be comfortable in your own skin \u2014 you don\u2019t always have to join the wave, that\u2019s how I see it. I\u2019ve never been banned from the iPhone group chat.\n\nI think Palm is different from those other brands that disappeared because it\u2019s got a place in the ecosystem of phones right now. If you really want to live life and not be so distracted by these big screens and big devices, this is obviously for you. And even if you want to keep those big screens, this is something you can keep for your on-the-go lifestyle. I like to take mine when I play golf, exercise, run, ride bikes, etc. You\u2019re still connected, but not distracted.\n\nI was also thinking about it from a kids\u2019 standpoint \u2014 there is a big play there. There are so many kids getting phones now and at such a young age. This is a device that could fit their lifestyle a lot better than some of those other devices.", "description": "Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors talks to us about his favorite things, including Sour Patch Kids, Apple AirPods, Hawthorne Body Wash, Palm phone, Apple iPad and Pencil, Conair Hair Pick, and the Netflix show Schitt\u2019s Creek", "authors": ["Steph Curry", "Simone Kitchens"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/10/04/wiclw-steph-curry/04-steph-curry-wiclw-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
