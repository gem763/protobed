Given that markets do not expect rates to\n\nrise for nearly a decade, such a formulation suggests that\n\npurchases could go on for years, possibly through most of\n\nChristine Lagarde's term leading the bank. As he announced the monetary stimulus package, ECB President\n\nMario Draghi also emphasized on the importance of fiscal\n\nstimulus and structural reforms, essentially saying that only a\n\ncombination of both monetary and fiscal stimulus could revive\n\nEuropean growth.\n\nThe ECB \"gave the impression to the market that we're pretty\n\nmuch done\" with monetary policy stimulus, said Vasileios\n\nGkionakis, global head of fx strategy at Lombard Odier, adding\n\nthat \"there's no denial that the ECB delivered on all fronts.\"\n\n\"The main message (from the ECB) is that we've seen the\n\nbottom in the euro/dollar,\" Gkionakis said.\n\nThe euro was up 0.3% at $1.1096 GBP=D3 after jumping\n\nearlier to $1.11095, its highest since Aug. 27. The 10-year\n\nGerman Bund yield surged to a six-week high of negative 0.48%\n\n.\n\nThe day before, the common currency briefly went below\n\n$1.10. Deutsche Bank had projected the euro would fall below\n\n$1.10 and now that it had, the German bank said it was now\n\nneutral on the common currency.\n\n\"We think the risks on the euro are now turning more\n\ntwo-sided,\" said George Saravelos, Deutsche's currency\n\nstrategist, in a note, adding he was \"not willing to turn\n\nbullish just yet.\"\n\n\"We believe will remain stuck around 1.10,\" he said.\n\nThe dollar rose overnight against the Japanese yen - after\n\nDonald Trump said he would not rule out an interim trade pact\n\nwith China - then gave back some of those gains. Washington and Beijing are preparing for new rounds of talks\n\naimed at curbing their trade war, which has dragged on for more\n\nthan a year, roiling financial markets and threatening to push\n\nother economies into recession. The yen, widely considered a\n\nsafe-haven currency, tends to rise during times of heightened\n\neconomic or market stress and vice versa.\n\nThe greenback was last down 0.1% at 107.99 versus the yen\n\nJPY=EBS after surging to a six-weeks high of 108.265.\n\nThe Chinese yuan also strengthened in the offshore market to\n\na four-week high of 7.0330 versus the dollar on the back of\n\nSino-U.S. trade optimism CNH=EBS . Dollar/yuan was last down\n\n0.3% at 7.0752.\n\n\"We've managed to scale back our pessimism about U.S.-China\n\ntrade talks, which is a supportive factor for now,\" said Takuya\n\nKanda, general manager of research at Gaitame.com Research\n\nInstitute in Tokyo.\n\nElsewhere, receding fears of a no-deal Brexit and dollar\n\nweakness pushed the pound to a seven-week high of $1.2435\n\nGBP=D3 on Friday. Investors trimmed their expectations of a\n\nno-deal Brexit after Northern Ireland's largest political party\n\nsaid it may agree on certain European Union rules after Britain\n\nexist the EU, even though it later denied those comments.\n\nAgainst the euro, the gains were more constrained, with\n\neuro/sterling last down 0.5% at 89.25 pence EURGBP=D3 .", "description": "FOREX-Euro surges as investors see ECB done with stimulus", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/forex_4_800x533_L_1413209320.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
