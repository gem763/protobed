The average lead at this point in the Premier League era is a mere 2.29 points. It is historically good. Liverpool might well be historically good.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Joao Cancelo - 4/10 He has only played 36 minutes in a City shirt despite being one of the best full backs in Europe. His time will come, but at the moment he is experiencing the same frustration Danilo endured behind Kyle Walker. Manchester City FC via Getty Ima 2/20 19. Moise Kean - 4/10 Last season he emerged as one of the best young forwards in Europe at Juventus. He has failed to live up to the hype so far at Everton, but it\u2019s still early in his Premier League career. Everton FC via Getty Images 3/20 18. David Luiz - 4/10 His move surprised many when he joined Arsenal from London rivals Chelsea. He has been at fault for numerous goals since his arrival, including a nightmare performance at Anfield. Improvement needed. Getty Images 4/20 17. Giovani Lo Celso - 5/10 The Argentinian's hotly anticipated arrival in London has been blighted by a hip injury that's restricted him to 44 minutes in the Premier League. Getty Images 5/20 16. Joelinton - 5.5/10 When Rondon left St James Park last season, fans were worried they\u2019d struggle to replace him. Joelinton has only managed one goal in his last seven game, however, there have been promising flashes from the Brazilian. Getty Images 6/20 15. Raul Jimenez - 6/10 After last season\u2019s 13 goals and 10 assists, Jimenez will no doubt prove a valuable acquisition for Wolves. Just two goals so far this season means he has been underwhelming. Getty Images 7/20 14. Adam Webster - 6/10 Duffy had been a stalwart in Brighton\u2019 side. Youngster Webster has managed to breakthrough in his place. Barring a poor lapse in concentration against Chelsea he has been solid. PA 8/20 13. Nicolas Pepe - 6/10 The \u00a372m winger is still adjusting to English football and has yet to recapture his goalscoring form at Lille. However, the signs of his quality are obvious for all to see. Getty Images 9/20 12. Sebastian Haller - 6.5/10 Haller started off slowly. But a brace at Watford set him on his way and he\u2019s now on three goals and one assist. If he can replicate his form from his time in Frankfurt, West Ham will be dangerous. Getty Images 10/20 11. Tyrone Mings - 6.5/10 Earned an England call-up through his performances, after making his loan spell permanent, but hasn't been able to totally sure up Villa's leaky defence. Aston Villa FC via Getty Images 11/20 10. Harry Maguire - 7/10 Has immediately improved United's defence since his impressive debut and adds leadership to a currently wildly inconsistent side. Getty Images 12/20 9. Moussa Djenepo - 7/10 Due to injury, Djenepo has only managed three appearances for Southampton. He has scored two goals though, and has brought pace and finishing ability reminiscent of Sadio Mane\u2019s time on the south coast. Action Images via Reuters 13/20 8. Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 7/10 With the most tackles in the league, Wan- Bissaka has been solid. The only criticism for the young full back? Going forward he could improve. Getty Images 14/20 7. Gary Cahill - 7.5/10 Has added some invaluable know-how to Palace\u2019s defence. A win at Old Trafford on debut and two clean sheets since then. Good start for the Champions League winner. REUTERS 15/20 6. Harry Wilson - 7.5/10 On loan from Liverpool, the young Welshman has produced moments of quality, including a long range strike (albeit deflected) at Villa Park and a delightful free kick against the Champions. Getty Images 16/20 5. Dani Ceballos - 7.5/10 The Spaniard has been superb for the most part. He has been instrumental in Arsenal\u2019s midfield. If you want to be cynical, it would be nice to see more in the goals and assist columns. UEFA via Getty Images 17/20 4. Rodrigo - 7.5/10 Has integrated relatively seamlessly into Guardiola's starting eleven and already feels as though he has been part of City's set up for a long time. Action Images via Reuters 18/20 3. Tanguy Ndombele - 7.5/10 Arguably one of the most well rounded midfielders in Europe. It\u2019s early days at Spurs but Ndombele has added goals and security in midfield. Getty Images 19/20 2. Daniel James - 8/10 What a bargain \u00a315 million was. Three goals this season and one of few causes for optimism in an abject Man Utd side. Potentially signing of the season if he keeps it up. Plus, he has all the time in the world to develop at 21 years of age. Getty Images 20/20 1. Youri Tielemans - 8.5/10 Superb start from Tielemans since joining the Foxes on a permanent basis. He is level with De Bruyne for completed through balls and has been a huge help to Maddison. Getty Images 1/20 20. Joao Cancelo - 4/10 He has only played 36 minutes in a City shirt despite being one of the best full backs in Europe.

They are the European champions, and undeniably one of the continent\u2019s strongest teams, probably now the best. They have already made the key club-changing move that United in 1985 \u2013 and indeed United in 2019 \u2013 were desperate for.\n\nLargest leads after eight matches in PL era 8 - Liverpool 2019/20 6 - Chelsea 2005/06 5 - Chelsea 2014/15 5 - Aston Villa 1998/99 4 - Newcastle 1995/96 3- Chelsea 2012/13\n\nThey\u2019ve gone through some hard yards, made hard decisions, learned some hard lessons \u2013 not least from last season. A title race can no longer pose any kind of surprise to them\n\nEven this run, after all, follows from last year\u2019s run-in. It\u2019s no freak spell. It\u2019s consistent with over a year of play now, which is why their next fixture could fittingly see them match Manchester City\u2019s record of 18 successive league wins. It is all why the confidence is obviously justified; why it\u2019s impossible not to feel it\u2019s their year, at this moment.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing \u2013 moments can quickly change, especially against a title rival as commanding as City\n\nAlong with a strong Sir Alex Ferguson United and maybe Jose Mourinho\u2019s first Chelsea, they are one of the few teams in Premier League history you would not feel entirely sure against, regardless of the lead. They are themselves capable of going on the kind of run that can change everything, that can haul you in. You really can\u2019t write them off.\n\nThere\u2019s also the intangible feeling from when a lead is cut. If City do reduce it to five points in the next few weeks, say, the very nature of having it cut means that five points will feel \u201cless\u201d than it did when Liverpool first created that gap. Then, they\u2019re only one game from it being properly tense. These are the curious psychological dynamics of a title race, that really enrich it.\n\nThere\u2019s also the likelihood that, given their injury problems right now, City are likely to go strong in January. They will surely sign, and then have big players coming back. They could be well primed for a run-in.\n\nThe big problem for them is that, in the three months until then, Liverpool look far more capable of a higher points return.\n\nEven their next few fixtures \u2013 away to United and home to Tottenham \u2013 seem to have fallen at the right time, against the right opposition. There\u2019s also the problem that Pep Guardiola has never really hauled in a lead of this size. Hence maybe his much-repeated comment on Monday morning that titles can be lost in the first eight games. He\u2019s experienced it.\n\nIt feels right now that the lead will actually only increase, that City will just slip more. Then again, going into the season, many expected the reverse of this; that the champions would sustain their form; that Liverpool just couldn\u2019t maintain the same level.\n\nIt can similarly only take one setback to reset things; one injury; one red card. The very fact we\u2019re pointing to this reflects how strong Liverpool\u2019s position is, though.\n\nThe title race obviously is far from over. It can change quickly, and there\u2019s a lot of time for that to happen. But the only thing that\u2019s happening right now is Liverpool careering away.", "description": "In striving to finally end a wait now going on 30 years, Liverpool\u00a0have already managed something that hasn\u2019t been done in 34 years, and never before that.
