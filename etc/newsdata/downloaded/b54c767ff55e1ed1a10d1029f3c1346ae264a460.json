Meanwhile, parts of the Bahamas are under immediate threat as the storm, with near 150 mph winds, slows as it approaches the archipelago on its westward journey.\n\nWhere is Hurricane Dorian?\n\nAt 11 p.m. EDT, Dorian was 310 miles east of Florida, slowing from 12 mph to 8 mph as it moved westward. The hurricane center says the core of Dorian is expected to be near or over the northwestern Bahamas on Sunday and near the Florida east coast late Monday or Tuesday.\n\nA tropical storm watch has been issued for part of Florida's east coast, from Deerfield Beach to Sebastian Inlet.\n\nHow Strong is it?\n\nDorian, already a major Category 4 storm early Saturday, strengthened again on Saturday, jumping from near 145 mph to near 150 mph. The National Hurricane Center says while some fluctuations in intensity are possible, Dorian is expected to remain a powerful hurricane over the next few days.\n\nPeople walk to their boat through a flooded parking lot at the Haulover Marine Center before the arrival of Hurricane Dorian on Aug. 30, 2019 in Miami Beach, Fla. The high water was due to King tide which may cause additional problems as Hurricane Dorian arrives in the area as a possible Category 4 storm along the Florida coast. More\n\nWhere is the most immediate danger from Dorian?\n\nThe Bahamas. The island group is expected to get tropical storm winds Saturday night, with the full force of the storm hitting the archipelago on Sunday. The NHC warns of life-threatening surges that could be 15 feet above normal tide level accompanied by \"large and destructive waves.\"\n\nIn the northwestern Bahamas, some of the most reliable computer models have the storm stalling and dumping as much as 50 inches.\n\nTracking:: Dorian, packing near 150 mph winds, bears down on The Bahamas\n\nWhen and where is it likely to make landfall in the U.S.?\n\nDorian continues on course for Florida, with possible landfall between West Palm Beach and Cape Canaveral early next week.\n\nNew projections, however, suggest that it may shift northward in the next two days, hugging the Florida coast en route to landfall in Georgia or the Carolinas. Some forecast tracks even see Dorian missing the U.S. coast altogether and swinging eastward back into the open Atlantic. But forecasters caution there are still many variables.\n\nPeople wait in line at a U-Haul store to fill their propane tanks before the possible arrival of Hurricane Dorian on August 30, 2019 in Boynton Beach, Fla. More\n\nDoes a shift in the track mean Florida is off the hook?\n\nNo. In fact, the National Hurricane Service and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warn that the variations in the forecast tracks could shift again and that Florida residents should continue preparations for a direct hit.\n\nEven with all the latest shifts in tracking, the entire peninsula still falls well within the \"cone of uncertainly\" as to where it will hit. \u201cLooking at these forecasts, a bump in one direction or the other could have really significant ramifications in terms of impact,\" DeSantis said Saturday. \"If it bumps further east, that obviously is positive. If it bumps just a little west, than you\u2019re looking at really, really significant impacts.\u201d\n\nWhat is the biggest threat to the east coast as the hurricane gets closer?", "description": "The strengthened storm bears down on the Bahamas but may turn north before hitting Florida directly.", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/J3UHeyo3iv49k63BuwXqIA--~B/aD0yNDE1O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/50d6a1cfece4573cc0774b5be655dcc6"}
