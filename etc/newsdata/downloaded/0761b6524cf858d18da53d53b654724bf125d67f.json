We had both been through pretty identical experiences with regards to our personal lives. We came to our relationship with two children each.\n\n'Today, we have a son together and five children between us! Navigating the complexities of a blended family is something I never imagined myself doing.\n\n'Becoming a Stepmum, laying out four school uniforms in the morning, teaching extra piano lessons, feeding an army, learning to balance family life, attempting to keep things \"fair and equal\" between five very different children, plus navigating the new dynamics every day brings, the \u2018mine, yours and ours\u2019,....the sense of achievement when it all goes well not to mention the love is very special indeed.\n\nAll together: Myleene shared a touching image on social media of her, Sim and their children's hands all touching and said that their love is 'very special'\n\nRevealing: The presenter explained how her life has changed since becoming a stepmother\n\n'Families come in all shapes and sizes, mine just happens to be fabulously blended...and big!\n\n'As everyone knows, no family, blended or otherwise is perfect but I am so proud of what Sim, myself and our children try to achieve every single day.'\n\nMyleene also spoke more about her family life on the Independent's Millennial Love podcast.\n\nShe explained that her and Simon's children are the same ages, meaning they have two eight-year-olds and two 12-year-olds, which is a 'gift in many ways'.\n\nHappy: Myleene shares Apollo with beau Sim, and she also has daughters Ava and Hero with ex-husband Graham Quinn, and Simon has two children from a previous relationship\n\nMyleene said: 'You have an idea where everyone's at, interests, even borrowing clothes - but it can be very tricky because the level of competitiveness is the same.'\n\nSince blending their families four years ago, the children have become good friends with the Hero and Sim's daughter who is nicknamed Leeny even calling themselves 'the twinnies'.\n\nThey've grown so close that Myleene said even when she plans for everyone to have their own space the children end up together.\n\nDoting: Myleene, pictured with baby Apollo, said the older children are 'thick as thieves' now and them being the same ages, two being eight and two being 12, is a 'gift in many ways'\n\nShe said they always end up in the same space and it's as if the children almost didn't want to be separate and wanted to be 'part of the unit'.\n\nThe broadcaster explained that becoming a stepmother was something she had never imagined doing, but that raising them is simple as it comes down to love.\n\nShe said: 'You have to be pretty selfless to be a parent, and then to be a step parent - even more so.\n\n'I never knew I could be this selfless, I mean 20 years ago I was a pop star and it was all about me. But it's quite simple with children, they just want to be loved.'\n\nNew addition: Speaking about becoming a stepmother Myleene, pictured surrounded by her family when Apollo was born, said that you have to be 'selfless'\n\nAlthough balancing a hectic schedule, Myleene revealed she taught Sim's daughter how to play the piano while she was pregnant with their son, and the youngster has already passed her grade one exam.\n\nDespite now adapting to their busy and blended life, Myleene admitted it was more tricky deciding to discipline each others children but this eventually came naturally.\n\nShe said: 'One time he [Sim] was out and someone spray painted the front garage and it [the discipline] just came naturally! It was pink, black and green - I just asked the children what were you thinking?!\n\n'They all just looked at me - all four of them are thick as thieves now.'\n\nMaking time: The presenter, pictured with daughter Hero, tries to make time for all her children and teaches them piano as well as having 'mumma school' on the Saturday to chat about their opinions on topics\n\nMyleene also spoke about how she refused to go on a date with Sim until she was sure he hadn't broken up his family and the children's insecurities.\n\nShe said that she could 'only imagine' what it was like from the children's vantage point to be in a blended family and that they worried when she was offered a job as they didn't want her 'dancing with another partner'.\n\nSince recording the podcast when she was eight months pregnant Myleene has welcomed her son Apollo and returned to work just 10 weeks after his birth.\n\nAnd just 12 days ago she shared a snap of herself hosting Classic FM alongside a pun-tastic caption, 'We\u2019re Bach! @classicfm', while cradling her baby son.", "description": "The presenter, 41, who is mother to Ava, 12, and Hero, eight, admitted she never imagined 'navigating the complexities of a blended family' but that the 'love is very special'.", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/19/20192388-0-image-a-61_1572027494408.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
