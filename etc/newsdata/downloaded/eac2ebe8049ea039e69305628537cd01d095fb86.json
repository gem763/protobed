I shall be writing personal letters to people who are politically close to you and I hope they take appropriate action. Get out of my court.\u201d\n\nThe issue was raised during prime minister\u2019s questions in the Commons on Wednesday where the Labour MP Jo Stevens asked if the prime minister was going to sack England.\n\nJohnson replied: \u201cIt would be inappropriate for me to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d However, legal proceedings have concluded in the case.\n\nA statement was issued on Wednesday evening in the name of the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Lord Davies of Gower, who said: \u201cRoss England has been suspended pending this matter being presented to the candidates committee.\u201d\n\nEngland had been endorsed for his candidature by his former employer, Alun Cairns, the secretary of state for Wales.\n\nStevens, who is the MP for Cardiff Central, said it was disgraceful that Johnson had refused to answer her question about England.\n\nShe said: \u201cI made clear the case had finished. The PM could and should have answered me. Both he, and the secretary of state who endorsed this individual as a candidate, have serious questions to answer about why this man is a Tory candidate.\u201d\n\nThe defendant in the rape trial, James Hackett, who is reportedly a friend of England, was subsequently convicted of rape in a fresh trial.\n\nThe victim denied the claims made by Ross during the trial in 2018 and has told the BBC that England\u2019s selection by the Welsh Conservatives \u201cshows how little respect they have for me\u201d.\n\nGwendolyn Sterk, a spokesperson for Welsh Women\u2019s Aid, said: \u201cWe find it significantly worrying that any party should select a candidate that has been deemed by a judge to have deliberately undermined a rape trial and caused further trauma to a survivor.\u201d\n\nCairns was asked by the Guardian if he was aware of the comments made by the judge when he endorsed England.\n\nA spokesperson for Cairns said: \u201cMr Cairns received no communication at any point from the court regarding this case. This is a matter for the individual as he was not employed by Mr Cairns at the point of case collapse or at his subsequent selection.\u201d\n\nEljai Morais, the Women\u2019s Equality party\u2019s general election candidate in Dover, said: \u201cDisdain for women is fast becoming the criteria for being a Conservative party candidate.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s lack of concern over fielding a candidate who deliberately sabotaged a rape trial is shocking but hardly surprising.\u201d", "description": "PM had been urged to act over Ross England, who is standing for election to Welsh assembly", "authors": ["Ben Quinn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0489ae55b0b0869643bdbec5a31a17baa53a70d4/0_205_5569_3342/master/5569.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8dd4d9f692dfc795a90bd25fa13726f8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
