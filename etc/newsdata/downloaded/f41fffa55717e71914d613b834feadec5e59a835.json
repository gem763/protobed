Based on the YA book Let It Snow: Three Holiday Romances, by Maureen Johnson, John Green, and Lauren Myracle, this Christmas gift is about three tales of romance that all intersect with one another. (You know, the old Love, Actually gambit.) Mitchell Hope wants Kiernan Shipka, Shameik Moore wants Isabela Moner, Liv Hewson wants Anna Akana, and Jacob Batalon seems to want everyone to be happy and have a good time. It\u2019s friends. It\u2019s love. It\u2019s Christmas. Let It Snow starts streaming November 8.\n\nRelated", "description": "Kiernan Shipka, Isabela Moner, Jacob Batalon, and Shameik Moore star in the trailer for Netflix\u2019s Let It Snow.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/22/22-let-it-snow.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
