During that scan the possibility of abnormalities was raised, only for Dr Carvalho to allegedly dismiss concerns.\n\n\"He explained that sometimes some parts of the face are not visible (on ultrasounds)... when the baby's face is glued to the belly of the mother,\" Rodrigo's aunt was quoted by AFP as telling a local broadcaster.\n\nAfter Rodrigo's birth and his abnormalities became clear, his parents were reportedly told he would only survive for hours.\n\nHowever, more than two weeks on, the boy is still alive under hospital care.\n\nHis parents have reportedly submitted a complaint about Dr Carvalho to the Portuguese Prosecutors' Office.\n\nWhat are the other cases?\n\nAmid outrage at baby Rodrigo's case, other complaints against Dr Carvalho have come to light.\n\nAt least six medical complaints are currently open against him, dating back to 2013, according to health officials.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption A number of other parents have been sharing their own distressing experiences\n\nOther parents have come forward to share their personal stories with Portuguese media of Dr Carvalho's alleged failure to detect health issues in their own pregnancies.\n\nIn one case a baby was born in 2011 with a facial disfigurement, deformed legs and severe brain damage.\n\nThe mother, named Laura Afonso, told Publico newspaper that she had submitted a criminal complaint against the doctor only for a prosecutor to dismiss it.\n\nNow aged eight, her child had had multiple surgeries but still could not speak or walk, she said.\n\nAnother criminal case where the child died months after their 2007 birth was also reportedly dismissed without reaching trial, Publico reports.\n\nWhat has reaction been?\n\nThe growing scandal has sparked outrage in Portugal. It has raised questions about how the country's health system works, as well as procedures for complaints.\n\nMiguel Guimar\u00e3es, president of Portugal's medical association (Ordem dos M\u00e9dicos), last week gave a press conference where he said he had directly contacted Dr Carvalho, given the \"social alarm\" caused by the case.\n\nThe doctor, he said, had agreed to stop performing procedures while investigations continued.\n\nThe body's disciplinary council then met earlier this week and unanimously agreed Dr Carvalho should be suspended for six months while investigations continued.\n\n\"There is strong evidence\" of the doctor's negligence, which \"may lead to a disciplinary sanction,\" Alexandre Valentim Lourenco, medical council chief for the southern region told a local broadcaster after the decision was announced.\n\nMr Lourenco said he hoped the suspension would go some way to help \"reassure\" pregnant women over the scandal.", "description": "Dr Artur Carvalho is accused of negligence in the case of baby Rodrigo and others.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13E25/production/_109354418_gettyimages-502384526.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
