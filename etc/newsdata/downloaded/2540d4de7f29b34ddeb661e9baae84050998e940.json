It's a move that could put the country on a new collision course with Brussels.\n\nFinance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said he hopes to have a \"constructive dialogue\" with the European Commission, and incoming Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni \u2014 an Italian who will face a hearing before the European Parliament on Thursday \u2014 said he will permit the maximum flexibility allowed by the rules. But Rome has yet to find a credible economic plan to cut its enormous public debt pile (which will rise to over 135 percent this year), decrease government borrowing and reboot its stagnating economy.\n\nIn April, the previous government, made up of the 5Stars and the far-right League, said next year's deficit would be 2.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and economic growth would reach just 0.2 percent in 2019. That forecast has now been revised down to 0.1 percent and the deficit target has been raised by 0.1 percentage points.\n\nGualtieri publicly insisted the government is focused on fighting tax evasion while also cutting tax on labor.\n\nThe structural deficit, which is the main figure watched by Brussels and does not take into account any growth fluctuations, is forecast to rise from 1.2 percent to 1.4 percent. In July, the European Commission said Italy should cut its structural deficit by 0.6 percentage points in 2020.\n\nThe opposition jumped on the government's spending plans.\n\n\"The PD was against the 5Stars' basic income [plan for all citizens] and they have now changed their minds. They were against increasing borrowing and now they are talking about a 2.2 percent deficit,\" said Alessandro Cattaneo, a lawmaker from Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.\n\nEconomists and analysts agree that the VAT hike would have had devastating effects on consumption and on public opinion, which is why Gualtieri said most of the extra borrowing would be used to block the increase, which would have kicked in automatically in the new year in order to keep deficit levels below the 3 percent ceiling imposed by EU rules by mitigating the effects of extra borrowing and sluggish economic growth.\n\nMatteo Renzi, who recently left the PD to form his own party, and the 5Stars both said they would vote against the budget if it had any tax raises whatsoever. But Cattaneo of Forza Italia said \"they are hiding the VAT hike behind complicated terms like 'remodulation of the brackets.'\"\n\nFormer Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who heads the League, said he is skeptical the government would not raise taxes.\n\nHowever, Gualtieri publicly insisted the government is focused on fighting tax evasion while also cutting tax on labor.\n\n\"We will never solve structural problems in this country unless we overcome tax evasion. The government will be very serious on this issue,\u201d Gualtieri told reporters on Monday night. Separately, the finance minister said that while he doesn't like the League's and the 5Stars' government flagship economic policies, including a partial pensions reform and a jobseekers' allowance, he would not get rid of either one but work to improve them.\n\nA PD official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the party is conscious about cutting spending and slashing those popular measures for the sake of EU fiscal rules at a time when Italy's economy isn't growing, because it \"would be a big gift to Salvini which we can't afford.\"", "description": "To avoid a damaging VAT rise, the 5Stars and Democratic Party agree to increase the country\u2019s deficit target for 2020.", "authors": ["Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli", "Imogen Sudbery", "Thibault Larger", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1167702110-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
