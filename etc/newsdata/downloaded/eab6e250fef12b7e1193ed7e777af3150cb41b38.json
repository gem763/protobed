Although some commenters thought it was hilarious to see the husband lounging while Emily worked, the blogger appeared unbothered\n\nThe video quickly went viral on Twitter and has been viewed more than 5.7 million times with people captivated by the transformation.\n\nBut commenters also couldn't get over Emily's husband, Blake, and how he only appeared to help out during specific moments of the renovation.\n\nAt the start of the renovation, Emily and her husband are filmed taking apart their bedroom and removing their bed to prepare for the transformation.\n\nThe wallpaper for one bedroom wall is then brought in to prepare for covering the surface that rests behind the couple's bed.\n\nAlthough Emily's husband is first filmed helping the woman put up the first sheet of wallpaper, he quickly loses interest and instead lounges on the ground while she works to fit the paper around one window.\n\nThe video goes on to show Blake appearing at different moments to help Emily wallpaper the entire wall, but also films him lounging or disappearing at other times as she continues to work.\n\nEnd results of the renovation reveal the wall behind the couple's headboard transformed with a burnt orange floral design to make the bedroom ready for the fall season.\n\nTired? As well as lying down, Emily's husband is also seen playing on his phone and sitting on the unmade bed while his wife works around him\n\nPushing on: The video showed the entire transformation of the couple's bedroom wall plus changes in decor\n\nHe's back! Emily's husband would return during different moments in the video to help\n\nPoking fun: Commenters enjoyed pointing out hilarious moments of when Blake was just chilling on the ground instead of helping\n\nComments quickly poured onto the viral Twitter thread, with many people mentioning Blake's work ethic - or lack there of.\n\n'Your mans chilling on the floor was the most relatable part of this tbh,' one commenter wrote.\n\nAnother person commented: 'Honestly though let's be real this is everyone's husband when it comes to home decorating.'\n\nThe video was also shared on the viral Instagram meme account TodayYearsOld, where it was mercilessly mocked by commnenters pointing out Blake's less-than-enthusiastic approach to the job.\n\n'Lmao he really just power napped through the whole damn thing. And probably said \"we did it\" at the end too,' one person wrote, while another added: 'He slept most of the video.'\n\nAnother simply wrote: 'And this is why men have a bad name.'\n\nOther women joked their marriage would've ended if they asked their husband to put up wallpaper.\n\n'My marriage would not be okay after putting up wallpaper,' a Twitter user wrote.\n\nIncredible: The blogger then shared before and after images to show how the bedroom changed following the renovations\n\nFunny: Many commenters couldn't get over Emily's husband throughout the time-lapse\n\nCelebration! The couple are pictured outside of their house after they purchased it\n\nTo this, Emily replied: 'Let me just say I edited out us screaming at each other 900 times.'\n\nHowever, there were some who leaped to Blake's defense, suggesting that Emily may well have wanted to tackle the project by herself, and that he was simply there to offer support when it was asked for.\n\n'Maybe that was her project and she wanted to do it herself. I get like that sometimes,' one Instagram user commented, as another said: 'Y\u2019all ever stop to think that maybe she wanted to do it by herself?'\n\nBesides the husband casually lounging during parts of the video, commenters were also concerned about the mirror placed precariously over the couple's headboard in the finished design.\n\nSome people were also not totally sold on the burnt-orange look for the bedroom and even went out of their way to insult Emily's new bedroom design.\n\n'Before is love! after was not great. sorry girl,' one person wrote about the transformation from Emily's old bedroom design to her new one.\n\nTrue: Another woman confessed her marriage would not survive the wallpaper portion\n\nCritiques: Emily also received harsh comments from people who did not like the transformation\n\nNot about it: Some online trolls were cruel with their commentary on the design\n\nUpdate: Emily later informed people that she appreciated her husband's help during the project and was unbothered by anyone who did not like the transformation\n\nBut Emily refused to let any criticism bring her down about the design.\n\n'Why are you apologizing to me like my dog died I guarantee the last thing I'm distraught over is kacey linn from twitter not liking my bedroom lmfao,' the woman savagely responded.\n\nEmily also updated followers to inform them about some of their concerns with the time-lapse.\n\n'To add: It's ok if you don't like it. It's bold choice of decor & that's why it's my bedroom \u2014 not yours,' she wrote, adding: 'My husband helped me when I needed him but most of it was a one person job. I enjoyed the company.'\n\nShe then went on to address anyone's concerns about her mirror resting on top of the headboard.\n\n'The mirror hangs on a wire but for the sake of the video I rested it,' Emily wrote.", "description": "A blogger named Emily from Florida shared with thousands of followers her bedroom transformation into the fall season.
