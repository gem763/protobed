Bush in the election.\n\n\u201cJohn Kerry has been talking to anyone who will listen about the president\u2019s shocking behavior with Ukraine,\u201d Carlson said of the former secretary of state\u2019s numerous media appearances denouncing Trump over his July call with Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\n\u201cKerry is full of it, you knew that. But, just to put some meat on those bones, during the 2004 election, which he lost, John Kerry openly bragged about soliciting support from foreign leaders against his opponent that year, the incumbent President George W. Bush,\u201d the host said.\n\nCarlson then read the quote from Kerry, which appeared in The Guardian: \u201cI've met foreign leaders who can't go out and say this publicly, but boy they look at you and say, 'you've got to win this, you've got to beat this guy, we need a new policy.' Things like that.\u201d\n\nFox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson: \u201cDuring the 2004 election, which he lost, John Kerry openly bragged about soliciting support from foreign leaders against his opponent that year, the incumbent President George W.
