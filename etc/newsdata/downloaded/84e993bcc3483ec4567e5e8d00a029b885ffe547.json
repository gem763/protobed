No queue at all for Hyperspace Mountain, where thrill-seekers are so scarce that Star Wars\u2019 Admiral Ackbar speaks to himself in the dark.\n\nTinker Bell gazes out over rows of empty seats on the train to Hong Kong Disneyland that was far busier before tourists were scared off by anti-government protests shaking this international hub for business and fun.\n\nThat\u2019s tough for local business but great for Disney fans like Yunice Tsui and her 7 and 4-year-old daughters, adorable in Minnie headbands. With an annual pass to the park she\u2019s already toured nine times, Tsui is better placed than most to size up the body-blow to Hong Kong visitor numbers from the often violent demonstrations, now in their fifth month.\n\n\u201cBefore June, you\u2019d generally queue for more than 30 minutes for each ride. For the last few times since July, we\u2019ve been here about two-to-three times, every time it\u2019s about a five-to-six minute wait to queue up for a ride. There are certainly less people, I would say 60% less. Kids are very happy because after a ride, they can go queue up for another one and play again.\u201d\n\nThe impact of the protests on tourism is verging on catastrophic for Hong Kong, one of the world\u2019s great destinations and geared up to receive 65 million visitors a year.\n\nOn Victoria Peak, restaurants with knock-out nighttime views of the city\u2019s neon-lit skyscrapers stand empty. The snaking lines of tourists for the clicketty-clacketty 19th-century tram to the top are now just a memory.\n\nThe Dragon Boat Carnival in June, when protests started: canceled. A Wine & Dine Festival scheduled for the end of this month: scrapped, too. Hong Kong received 2.3 million fewer visitors in August compared with a year earlier, largely trips that people from elsewhere in China are no longer making to the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. September visitor numbers, due Oct. 31, are unlikely to be any better, given recent protest-related violence and chaos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s deserted,\u201d said Dyutimoy Chakraborty, who runs the Gordon Ramsay Bread Street Kitchen & Bar opposite the Peak Tram. The tram now closes at 10 p.m. instead of midnight, because of \u201cpotential demonstrations and protests in the nearby area.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally, there would be a huge queue,\u201d Chakraborty said on a recent weeknight. \u201cSince the protests started, it has been like this.\u201d\n\nThe eatery has lost nearly half of its weekday business, he added.\n\n\u201cYou think of what you could have made and what you are making at the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThat difference, yes, it hurts.\u201d\n\nProtester leaflets advise, \u201cYou\u2019ve arrived in a broken, torn-apart city,\u201d and the protests have at times caused monumental disruptions of traffic and public transport.\n\nBut even when the protests have involved hundreds of thousands of people, they\u2019ve generally been confined to only a few areas in this semi-tropical former British colony of 7 million.\n\nAnd the tourists who come anyway are finding bargain-basement hotel rates, two-for-one deals, easy late checkouts and other sweeteners.\n\nVisiting this month from Taiwan, where he works as a teacher, South African traveler Winand Koch paid the equivalent of just US$65 per night for a room in a comfy hotel that was charging nearly quadruple that rate when he first checked a few months back. Of all his trips to Hong Kong, the two-day stay with his sister, Betro, was \u201cone of the best,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen Hong Kong this quiet before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to queue anywhere. We could get in everywhere.\u201d\n\nTrundling along with suitcases through crowds of demonstrators, hoping to catch a train to the airport a day after protest violence shut down the entire rail network, Koch said he\u2019d enjoyed being \u201cpart of history.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy accident ran into the protest today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was fun, actually, the people were all friendly, helping us through \u2026 they even gave us masks.\u201d\n\nAside from the risk of stumbling unawares into street battles and clouds of police tear gas - as some tourists have to their coughing, spluttering dismay - Hong Kong remains a pleasant city. Visitors of either sex needn\u2019t think twice about venturing out late at night or while wearing valuables. For the moment, the U.S. State Department still only recommends that visitors exercise extra caution. A similarly worded travel advisory from the British government says, \u201cmost visits are trouble free.\u201d\n\nEdgar Ruiz said he flew from Mexico \u201cjust to see the protests.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to experience it firsthand. This is big!\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be telling people that I was here when this happened, because it is going to be major in history.\u201d\n\nEven some Hong Kong residents are enjoying a respite from the usual floods of visitors, mainly from mainland China. The number of total arrivals has almost doubled over the past decade, from 36 million in 2010 to 65 million last year.\n\nUp on the Peak, Hong Kong-born Isaac Mercado, a 26-year-old banking analyst, was luxuriating in the unusual emptiness.\n\n\u201cWe used to have a quiet city,\u201d he said. Now, with fewer visitors, \u201cI get the chance to explore more a bit on my own, and not be crammed with loads of tourists. So, it\u2019s getting more like my home, rather than a tourist city.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Mstyslav Chernov contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "No tiresome wait for hugs and kisses from Mickey and Minnie Mouse.
