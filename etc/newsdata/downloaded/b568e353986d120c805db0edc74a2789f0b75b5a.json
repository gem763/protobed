I don\u2019t drive, neither does my mum. 3) It\u2019s 2019 not 1969.\"\n\nComments flooded in to support Niamh and her hero dad.\n\n\"The people posting negative comments need to pull their heads in,\" said one. \"I have three daughters aged seven , five and 20 months. No doubt I'll be in a shop picking up pads one day! Your dad sounds like a legend.\"\n\nIt's not the first time a man has made the mistake, after a woman named Borgan Paget posted about the same experience in August .\n\nWhen she asked her boyfriend Lewis to nip to the shop and pick her up a box of tampons, he became overwhelmed by the choice on offer and messaged her to ask \"Do you want the lemon or the lime?\"\n\nTurns out it's an easy mistake to make.", "description": "People loved the dad's sweet response and labelled him a 'legend'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Niamhpemx", "Jam Press"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649297.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_PAY-Jampress_dad_tampon_banter_003JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
