The standoff has seen work on the country\u2019s forthcoming cryptocurrency legislation grind to a halt.\n\nThe latest deadline for the cryptocurrency bill is November 1, after Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered parliament and the finance ministry to streamline the bill drafting process.\n\nMeanwhile, in Paraguay, the government looks set to rule that companies dealing with cryptocurrencies must comply with the nation\u2019s anti money-laundering (AML) laws. Per Criptonoticas, an MP for the Patria Querida party says parliamentarians have entered discussions with the Central Bank of Paraguay on the subject of cryptocurrencies.\n\nPer the MP, the government will speak to finance officials about whether the country should fine-tune existing legislation or draft a new legislative framework to establish cryptocurrency legislation.\n\nThe MP stated that a full set of crypto laws and guidelines would likely be in place by the end of 2020, but that in the lead-up period, exchanges and other businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies must abide by existing AML laws.\n\nAnd in Mexico, a regulatory official has suggested that cryptocurrencies be kept at a \u201chealthy distance\u201d from the financial system.\n\nAccording to El Financiero, a member of the Consejo Emisor del Consejo Mexicano de Normas de Informaci\u00f3n Financiera (literally the Mexican Council of Financial Information Standards) also stated,\n\n\u201c[Individuals and companies] using [cryptocurrencies] must be identified, and we must establish measures that prevent [cryptocurrencies] from being used to gain from cyber attacks or other illegal activities.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, as reported, a banking company claims it will allow Mexican customers to make payments in cryptocurrencies using debit cards. The firm, named Tauros, says its new digital account lets customers keep money in fiat as well as tokens including bitcoin.", "description": "Senior officials in Russia, Mexico and Paraguay have given hints that their respective countries will seek to regulate cryptocurrencies \u2013 with an unprecedented three-pronged approach to crypto, a more considered approach and a plan to keep tokens well away from conventional finance all on the cards.", "authors": ["Tim Alper"], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/articles/0/5d9/5c81754b74.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
