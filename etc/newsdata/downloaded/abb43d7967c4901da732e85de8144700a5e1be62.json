But there is no indication that Pompeo objected when Trump withheld all of the assistance while Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 and the president himself \u2014 pressed the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nMost worrisome to the department is concern that Pompeo did not intervene to protect U.S. diplomats either enlisted by Giuliani to assist his efforts or punished for being insufficiently committed to the cause, according to more than a dozen current and former officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com National-Security Demoralized-State-Department-Personnel-Question-Pompeos-Role-In-Ukraine-Crisis"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
