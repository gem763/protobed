Naming the building after her will be in line with what the Human Sciences strives for; that of being a College that acts as the conscience of society-striving for social justice!\" the motivation on the university's website reads.\n\nThree other buildings will be named after Professor Nkoana Simon Radipere, Simiso Nkwanyana and Anton Lembede.\n\nThe EFF reiterated its call for the Cape Town International Airport to also be named after Madikizela-Mandela.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
