REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany\u2019s DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce on Wednesday said it expected exports to shrink next year for the first time since the global financial crisis over a decade ago as trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty hit Europe\u2019s largest economy.\n\n\u201cFor our economy, with its strong industrial core, this is a huge challenge,\u201d DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association\u2019s latest business sentiment survey among more than 28,000 managers.\n\nDIHK said it expects Germany\u2019s annual export growth to slow to 0.3% this year from 2.1% in 2018, adding that exports are likely to shrink by 0.5% next year.\n\n\u201cSince the financial crisis of 2008/2009, the DIHK has not received such pessimistic replies from the companies,\u201d Schweitzer said. He pointed out that Germany\u2019s average export growth rate was normally around 5.5 percent.\n\nDue to the bleak trade outlook, the DIHK cut its 2019 gross domestic product growth forecast for the German economy to 0.4% from 0.6% previously.\n\nIt forecasts GDP growth of 0.5% for 2020, adding that the increase was mainly due to an unusual high number of working days next year.", "description": "Germany's DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce on Wednesday said it expected exports to shrink next year for the first time since the global financial crisis over a decade ago as trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty hit Europe's largest economy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446437707&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0CY", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
