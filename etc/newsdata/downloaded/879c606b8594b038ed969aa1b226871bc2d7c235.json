Mao was working for Huawei in secret in 2017 when he entered into an agreement to use CNEX's product that required him not to share the software with third parties such as the Chinese company, according to the federal criminal complaint.\n\nFBI agents, however, said Mao had sent emails to Huawei\u2019s employees discussing plans for the technology and related information. When CNEX asked Mao if he had shared any confidential data \u2013 such as the product number -- with the Chinese company, he denied doing so, court papers show.\n\nFollowing last month\u2019s arrest, Mao pleaded not guilty and was freed on a $100,000 bond, the Post reported.\n\nIn December 2017, just months before the theft, Huawei sued CNEX and one of its founders, who formerly worked for the Chinese company, for breach of contract and trade secret misappropriation, a Huawei spokesperson told FOX Business on Thursday. A judge threw out all but one of the claims.\n\nHuawei emphasized that it's not targeted in the government's case against Mao, which was moved to the Eastern District of New York, where federal prosecutors are investigating claims that Huawei stole intellectual technology from several people and companies over a period of years.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe Chinese business has been sued by U.S. firms such as Motorola Solutions and T-Mobile over similar claims. Last year, CFO Men Wangzhou was arrested in Canada and accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn May, President Trump signed an executive order banning U.S. agencies from using Huawei \u2013 a move that the company later said might decrease revenue by $30 million.\n\nA spokesperson from the University of Texas at Arlington would not comment on the ongoing investigation.", "description": "Bo Mao was arrested\u00a0in Fort Worth, Texas, on August 14\u00a0and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in the theft of\u00a0a first-of-its-kind drive from CNEX Labs\u00a0in February 2017.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/547815-huawei-logo.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"}
