Two hours later, and with millions of us cheering him on, Kipchoge broke the two-hour marathon barrier with 20 seconds to spare.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not a new world record \u2013 he already holds that \u2013 it was not an open race and he was paced. So what? He ran every single step of those 42.2km; he did it because he wanted to, because he could. Because he believes no human is limited.\n\nBarely 24 hours later, a slip of a young woman in a bright leotard put behind her horrendous abuse and potentially career-ending trauma to soar through the air and take her 25th world championship gold medal.\n\nShe is now the most decorated gymnast of all time.\n\nBut Simone Biles was one of many young woman gymnasts who suffered sexual abuse at the hands of former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nShe could have given up. She could have retreated from the world and no one would have blamed her. But she came back and won \u2013 and won again. Because she believes no human is limited.\n\nI will freely admit to crying my eyes out last weekend, but they were tears of joy and pride and hope. Kipchoge and Biles, and the Japanese rugby team who played with the hopes and dreams of a nation pushing them on, are the humans who give me hope for our future.\n\nVacuous celebrities and lying, crooked politicians do not deserve our respect or adoration.\n\nThat we should reserve for the Eliuds and Simones of the world. Humans who push themselves to the limits and beyond their capacity. Humans who refuse to take the easy way out.\n\nI\u2019ll end with the gracious and inspiring words of Kipchoge again. This is his response to a congratulatory tweet from former US president Barack Obama: \u201cDear Mr Obama, thank you for your special words. In life we hope to inspire others. It would be my greatest honour if we could meet and discuss how we can make this world a running world. A running world is a peaceful world.\u201d\n\nThat is a sentiment with which we can all agree.", "description": "\u2018Idon\u2019t know where the limits are, but I would like to go there.\u201d.", "authors": ["Yvonne Grimbeek"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9493/865c03bf447740528280b1e3fcd897a1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
