It also claims that Trump\u2019s due process rights are being violated and is attacking the conduct of House intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi has insisted the House is well within its rules to conduct oversight of the executive branch under the Constitution regardless of a formal impeachment inquiry vote.\n\nSchiff, commenting before the White House letter was released, said, \u201cFor this impeachment inquiry we are determined to find answers.\u201d\n\nThe letter marks the beginning of a new strategy to counter the impeachment threat to Trump: Stall. Obfuscate. Attack. Repeat. Trump aides have been honing their approach after two weeks of what allies have described as a listless and unfocused response to the impeachment probe.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump intensified his fight with Congress by blocking Gordon Sondland, the U.S. European Union ambassador, from testifying behind closed doors about the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nSondland\u2019s attorney, Robert Luskin, said his client was \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d that he wouldn\u2019t be able to testify. And Schiff said Sondland\u2019s no-show was \u201cyet additional strong evidence\u201d of obstruction of Congress by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that will only strengthen a possible impeachment case.\n\nA whistleblower\u2019s complaint and text messages released by another envoy portray Sondland as a potentially important witness in allegations that the Republican president sought to dig up dirt on a Democratic rival in Ukraine and other countries in the name of foreign policy.\n\nPelosi said thwarting the witness testimony on Tuesday was an \u201cabuse of power\u201d in itself by the president.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters that no additional witnesses under its purview will be permitted to appear in front of Congress or comply with document requests, saying the policy under the current circumstances is that the administration will have \u201ca full halt\u201d because \u201cthis is not a valid procedure\u201d for an impeachment inquiry. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration\u2019s position.\n\nThe White House is claiming that Trump\u2019s constitutional rights to cross-examine witnesses and review all evidence in impeachment proceedings extend even to House investigations, not just a potential Senate trial. It also is calling on Democrats to grant Republicans in the House subpoena power to seek evidence in the president\u2019s defense.\n\n___\n\nFollow Miller on Twitter at https://twitter.com/zekejmiller .", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The White House declared Tuesday it will not cooperate with what it termed the \"illegitimate\" impeachment probe by House Democrats,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/08/22fc8c_trump-84556-donald-trump-president-donald-trump-pauses-speaking-ceremony-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
