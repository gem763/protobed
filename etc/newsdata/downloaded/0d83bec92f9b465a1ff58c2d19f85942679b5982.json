Low-income Londoners are being offered \u00a32,000 to scrap their older cars and purchase ULEZ-compliant new models under a new scheme launched by Sadiq Khan\n\nThe ULEZ is currently in force in Central London in the same area as the Congestion Charge Zone.\n\nBut from October 2021 it will expand to the North and South Circular Road, covering the 32 London Boroughs and City of London.\n\nDrivers of non-compliant older cars have - since April this year - been forced to pay \u00a312.50 each day they enter the ULEZ in their vehicles as part of mayor Khan's increased efforts to reduce London's poor air pollution statistics.\n\nThat means regular drivers will soon need to replace their older cars to avoid the daily penalty where they live.\n\nOnly electric or hybrid vehicles and the latest euro 6 standard diesels or a euro 4 or newer petrol are exempt from the charge.\n\nIn February, Khan acknowledged that it would be difficult for many low income families living in London to replace their older cars and vowed to launch a scrappage scheme to help them purchase a greener machine that is ULEZ compliant.\n\nIt was confirmed on Wednesday morning that this incentive would amount to \u00a32,000 for the scrappage of an old car and \u00a31,000 for a non-ULEZ-compliant motorbike.\n\nThe London mayor first announced the \u00a325m vehicle scrappage scheme for the capital in February\n\nHowever, there are restrictions on who can apply for the scheme.\n\nOnly those on specific benefits will be eligible, including:\n\nUniversal Credit Income Support Armed Forces Independence Payment Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit Attendance Allowance Jobseeker's Allowance Carer's Allowance Pension Credit Child Tax Credit Personal Independence Payment Constant Attendance Allowance Severe Disablement Allowance Disability Living Allowance War Pensions Mobility Supplement Employment and Support Allowance Working Tax Credit Housing Benefit\n\nRules also demand that the vehicle being scrapped is registered to the applicant or someone living at the same address - and must have been owned by them for more than 12 months prior to 23 October 2019.\n\nAs well as the applicant having their tax, MOT and insurance all in order, the car or motorcycle in question must also fail to meet ULEZ standards.\n\nThe mayor said in a statement: 'Here in London with our bold plans we have already cut pollution by a third in central London where we have implemented the world\u2019s first Ultra Low Emission Zone and worked tirelessly to clean up the bus and taxi fleet.\n\n'Despite the lack of Government support, our car and motorcycle scrappage scheme will enable low-income and disabled Londoners to scrap their older, polluting vehicles and switch to cleaner versions.'\n\nThe ULEZ is due to be expanded across London from October 2021. Drivers will be charged \u00a312.50 each time they use their non-compliant vehicles\n\nThink tank Centre for London welcomed the scheme but argued if \u00a32,000 was substantial enough to help hard-pressed families afford compliant cars - most of which are expensive\n\nWhile the scheme could help up to 12,500 London families replace their older cars, this is just a fraction of the capital's population believed to be living in poverty.\n\nFigures released in 2017 by charity Trust for London estimated that 58 per cent of the 2.3 million Londoners below the poverty line are members of households in which someone is working to earn a living.\n\nAnd a London-dedicated think tank said the amount being offered won't be enough to help most afford a ULEZ-eligible car.\n\nSilviya Barrett, research manager at Centre for London said: 'The launch of the scheme is good news in principle, but whether a \u00a32,000 grant is enough to cover the costs of buying a new, cleaner vehicle is questionable.'\n\nTo apply for the scheme, Londoners should visit: http://tfl.gov.uk/car-motorcycle-scrappage.", "description": "The scheme allows low-income families and those with disabilities living in London to claim \u00a32,000 to scrap a car.
