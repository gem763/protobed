For the week, however,\n\nit dropped 0.6%, snapping two weekly gains.\n\nHotel developer and operator Bloomberry Resorts Corp\n\nand real estate developer Robinsons Land Corp\n\nwere the top gainers on the index, rising 3.9% and\n\n2.9%, respectively.\n\nMalaysian stocks closed 0.3% higher, helped by\n\nindustrial stocks.\n\nPort services provider MISC Bhd rose 3.5%, while\n\nSime Darby Bhd gained 1.3%.\n\nThai stocks ended the session little changed, with\n\nlosses among telecom and industrial stocks offset by gains in\n\nfinancial and energy stocks.\n\nThe country also unveiled a generous relocation package on\n\nFriday to attract foreign companies looking to move production\n\nbecause of the intensifying Sino-U.S. trade war. Meanwhile, Singapore stocks posted its first weekly\n\ngain in seven, but ended the session marginally lower.\n\nGains among financial stocks were outweighed by losses in\n\nindustrials.\n\nVietnam, the most-favoured destination for manufacturing\n\nfirms moving out of China to avoid tariffs, has not taken the\n\nnews of talks between U.S. and China in October well, as the\n\ncountry's stock index fell 0.3%.
