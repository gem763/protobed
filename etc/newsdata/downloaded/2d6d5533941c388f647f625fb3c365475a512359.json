Some 8,000 officers, more than a quarter of the city\u2019s force, had to be deployed to tackle the protest.\n\nThe result she said was \u201ca less good service to the rest of London. Partly because people get tired and partly because we just had to slow down certain types of inquiries, certain types of investigations would just be done more slowly and some things won't ever be done at all.\"\n\nNo serious crime or 999 calls had been affected, said Ms Dick, but Detectives had been called in to cover some frontline duties and officers had been taken off neighbourhood and school patrols.\n\nPeople who contacted police over a minor incident had been told \u201cwe can\u2019t deal with that now and probably won\u2019t be able to do so for a while,\u201d she said.", "description": "Extinction Rebellion\u2019s protests cost \u00a321 million to police and led to other investigations being stalled and some policing \u201cnot done at all,\u201d Britain\u2019s most senior police officer has revealed.", "authors": ["Charles Hymas", "Home Affairs Editor", "Vera Baird", "Tom Harris", "Eilis O'Hanlon", "Owen Paterson"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213082853-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
