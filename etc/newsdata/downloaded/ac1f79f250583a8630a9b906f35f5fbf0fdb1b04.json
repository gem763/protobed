I doubt he even likes the president much.\n\nPompeo graduated first in his class at West Point decades ago, a feat that suggests enormous reserves of discipline, a profound respect for tradition and a talent for self-effacement when the circumstances warrant it. Trump possesses none of those qualities.\n\nPompeo is an evangelical Christian, steeped in the very dictums that Trump has spent a lifetime mocking with both his words and his deeds. And Pompeo has long believed in the importance of American military intervention abroad, the kind of activist role that Trump railed against during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nSign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter\n\nIn fact Pompeo, who was then a congressman from Kansas, supported Marco Rubio \u2014 and publicly praised him, while disparaging Trump, just before the state\u2019s Republican caucus in March 2016. As Susan Glasser of The New Yorker recalled in an excellent recent profile of Pompeo, he sounded an alarm that Trump would be \u201can authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution.\u201d He urged Republicans to come to their senses and resist the lure of the surging Trump campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said, \u201cto turn down the lights on the circus.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the lights continued to burn bright, so Pompeo just put on a clown suit, put away his ethics and finagled a big role under the Big Top.\n\nHe had plenty of company in that transformation. It\u2019s the wonder of the Trump era and one of the saddest, scariest themes of the impeachment inquiry so far: the teeming crowd of sellouts and suck-ups who eagerly traded principle for position and are in some cases doubling and tripling down on that transaction, to a point where it\u2019s fair to ask if there was ever much principle to begin with.\n\n[Get a more personal take on politics, newsmakers and more with Frank Bruni\u2019s exclusive commentary every week.

Hell, I\u2019m looking at most of the Republicans in the Senate. I\u2019m not so much looking at Attorney General William Barr, odious as his behavior has been, because it\u2019s clear in retrospect that he never made much of a pretense of rectitude, at least not in the context of Trump. He also wasn\u2019t on record trashing Trump, not the way Pompeo and Graham and so many others who now dutifully echo him and gaze beatifically at him were. They must have broken necks from their moral whiplash. Barr\u2019s neck supports that big head of his just fine.\n\nPompeo, who first signed on as Trump\u2019s C.I.A. director and then flattered his way to secretary of state, is a paragon of these lackeys-come-lately, and he\u2019s especially vivid proof of how easily and completely the lure of power can overwhelm any call to conscience.\n\nHe raised his hand for secretary of state after he\u2019d seen his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, humiliated by Trump and fired by tweet. This was more than a year into Trump\u2019s presidency, by which point the rationalizations of other supposedly serious conservatives who took top administration jobs no longer held water. It was clear that Trump wasn\u2019t just a few artful nudges away from proper presidential bearing. He couldn\u2019t be lifted up because he was too busy cruelly dragging everyone else down.\n\nBut Pompeo had a heady shot at a vaunted job that almost surely wasn\u2019t going to come his way any other time. So he lunged for it, then demonstrated with his obsequiousness that doing good and doing right were never high on the agenda.\n\nHe wrote an op-ed article that essentially broke with his fellow Republicans to promote Trump\u2019s view that Saudi Arabia\u2019s butchery of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi shouldn\u2019t give anyone pause. What are a few severed body parts among allies?\n\nHe recalled the ambassador to Ukraine just to please the president and his babbling Beelzebub, Rudy Giuliani. He listened mutely to that July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, decided to ignore what he heard and then claimed \u2014 until a few days ago \u2014 that he was utterly in the dark about any pressure on Ukraine to kneecap Joe Biden.\n\nHad he spoken up or pushed back, he would have risked ending up on the outside, among the swelling Trump administration diaspora. He preferred the inside, with its glossier trappings and cushier thrones. He and his wife were diplomatic royalty, jetting around the world. He could bear the ache of a tongue full of tooth marks. Better to be a wretched part of history than no part at all.\n\nThe tale sounds familiar because it is. It\u2019s the story of Faust, who sold his soul for renown, then endured the ugliness of that deal. It\u2019s also the story of too many of Trump\u2019s Republican enablers to count. Sure, they decided to prop and pretty him up, a man whose unfitness for the Oval Office was never really in doubt, out of tribal loyalty, a force far too potent in American politics today. But some rushed to him because that\u2019s where the riches were, at least metaphorically. That\u2019s where the fame was.\n\nAnd they weren\u2019t simply burying the hatchet with a politician who hadn\u2019t been their preferred candidate or whose positions differed from theirs only slightly. They were dismantling the chain saw that they\u2019d wielded in the face of a fraud whose conduct, along with some of his proposals, was antithetical to who they claimed to be.\n\nFew people remember anymore, but just years before she became the dark empress of \u201calternative facts,\u201d Kellyanne Conway was a respected, reasonably mainstream, uncontroversial Republican pollster and strategist. Just months before she joined Team Trump, she correctly labeled him \u201cvulgar,\u201d said that he wasn\u2019t presidential, called him a liar and demanded his tax returns. Then he offered her the lofty job of managing his presidential campaign \u2014 and all the television airtime that came with it \u2014 and she turned herself into a kowtowing cartoon. She\u2019ll never be seen the same way again. Was the ride really worth it?\n\nAnd what was Mick Mulvaney thinking when he agreed to be Trump\u2019s third chief of staff, having witnessed the tortures of chiefs Nos. 1 and 2? Before Trump was elected, Mulvaney called him and Hillary Clinton \u201ctwo of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country,\u201d and lest you think Trump was merely collateral damage in her disparagement, Mulvaney separately called Trump \u201ca terrible human being.\u201d Now he calls him boss. Amazing how revulsion crumbles when relevance is in the equation.\n\nGraham was oddly and briefly honest about this in an interview with The Times\u2019s Mark Leibovich, framing his kinship with Trump, whom he once called \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest jackass,\u201d as part of his career-long quest \u201cto try to be relevant.\u201d This quest now involves the insistence that Trump, rather than abusing the presidency to dig up imagined dirt on a political rival, is the victim of some setup.\n\nYou can hear Graham\u2019s version as predictably loopy illogic from a senator up for re-election next year in the deep-red state of South Carolina, but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s the fee for being able to get the president on the phone, for being invited to play golf with him, for feeling the rush of access, for crowing about your perch at the epicenter of the action. He and Pompeo will have insider anecdotes to last the rest of their lives. They\u2019ll need just as long to convince themselves that they didn\u2019t overpay.\n\nI invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.
