Although the majority of the delivery was done by a FedEx truck, the last mile was completed by drone.\n\nThe yellow and white drones are loaded with packages at a local center of operations called the \u201cNest,\u201d where Wing employees pack them with up to three pounds (1.3 kilograms) of goods, deliverable within a six mile (10 kilometer) radius.\n\nOnce they have arrived at their destination, the drones don\u2019t land. Instead, they hover above the house and lower the package with a cable.\n\nOther companies are working to launch similar services, most notably Amazon, UPS and Uber Eats. But Wing was the first to obtain a license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), authorizing company pilots to fly multiple drones at the same time.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Alphabet (Google) subsidiary Wing has become the first company in the United States to deliver packages by drone.
