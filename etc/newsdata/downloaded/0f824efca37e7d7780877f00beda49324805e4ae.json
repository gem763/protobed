Sometimes it just looks meanspirited.\n\nMr. Castro took the starkest shot yet at Mr. Biden\u2019s capabilities during a heated exchange over health care policy at the debate. \u201cAre you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d Mr. Castro said, repeating himself three times. It had the effect of thrusting out into the open a fact that has been the subtext of other candidates\u2019 strategies for months.\n\nLater that night, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey also expressed reservations about Mr. Biden, telling CNN that \u201cthere are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d\n\nThe attacks failed. By Sunday, Mr. Booker had backed off his Biden criticism \u2014 not the first time he\u2019d done so during the campaign .\n\nAnd Representative Vicente Gonz\u00e1lez of Texas defected from supporting Mr. Castro to Mr. Biden, in part because of Mr. Castro\u2019s provocative questions on the debate stage, according to people familiar with his decision.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re polling in the low single digits and you\u2019re not raising any resources and you\u2019re fracturing your party and you\u2019re just getting your supporters to be upset at other candidates, it certainly can\u2019t be a good thing for our party,\u201d Mr. Gonz\u00e1lez said Sunday on CNN, alluding to Mr. Castro\u2019s attack.", "description": "Younger candidates are running as agents of generational change, but it is three septuagenarians who have emerged as the front-runners.
