(AP) - Melvin Gordon would likely be continuing his holdout if the Los Angeles Chargers had gotten off to a 3-0 start. But with the Bolts on a two-game losing streak after winning their opener, the running back decided this week was the best time to report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re 1-2. You don\u2019t want to get into a big hole,\u201d Gordon said after Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cYou work the whole offseason to be in a good position to make the playoffs. I had to come back at some point. I want to come back and help contribute. When we lost again (last Sunday to Houston) I wasn\u2019t feeling this at all. These guys did nothing to me.\u201d\n\nGordon\u2019s return might not have come at a better time. The Chargers are hampered by injuries going into Sunday\u2019s game at Miami.\n\nCoach Anthony Lynn is hoping he doesn\u2019t have to use Gordon this week, but he might not have any choice. Running back Justin Jackson, who was averaging 20 plays per game during Gordon\u2019s holdout, will not play after suffering a calf injury Thursday. Gordon is on a two-week roster exemption but could be activated after Saturday\u2019s practice. If Gordon doesn\u2019t play, the Chargers would likely sign Detrez Newsome from the practice squad.\n\nLynn said Gordon\u2019s fitness level looks great, but that the past couple of days have been spent on the finer points such as position alignment.\n\n\u201cWe really had to drill those today and try to get him back into shape mentally for the position,\u201d Lynn said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t made a cut and had to break a tackle. We tried to put him through the gauntlet in practice to simulate hitting. It\u2019s still not real football. Ideally, you don\u2019t want to play the guy this week.\u201d\n\nGordon held out because he was seeking a contract of $13 million to $14.4 million per season, which was equivalent to deals signed by Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le\u2019Veon Bell. The Chargers offered around $10 million per year before suspending negotiations prior to the start of the regular season.\n\nHis base salary for this season is $5.6 million under the fifth-year option of his rookie contract. Gordon was subject to $1.2 million worth of fines along with losing $988,236 for missing the first three games, but he said the team cut the fines in half.\n\nGordon said he understood the consequences of sitting out and that he was the reason he held out despite his agents advising him to come in.\n\n\u201cNothing came out of it, so I try not to think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, there is no contract, so it\u2019s obviously something I don\u2019t want to speak on. \u2026 To think the fines would be completely washed away, I knew if I got in this situation, it wouldn\u2019t be. You do something against the rules, you pay the consequences.\u201d\n\nGordon also said he talked to general manager Tom Telesco throughout the process and that his relationship with the front office remains good.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the bridges are burned, we just had some differences,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cHe (Telesco) let it be known he wanted me back. He had no problems and understood from a player\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nGordon has gained over 1,200 yards from scrimmage and scored 10 or more touchdowns in three straight seasons but has had his struggles against Miami. He is averaging only 2.6 yards per carry and has one touchdown in three games against the Dolphins.\n\nNOTES: Wide receiver Mike Williams (back), tight ends Virgil Green (groin) and Hunter Henry (knee) and kicker Michael Badgley (groin) are out for Sunday\u2019s game while wide receiver Travis Benjamin (hip) is doubtful.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Melvin Gordon would likely be continuing his holdout if the Los Angeles Chargers had gotten off to a 3-0 start.
