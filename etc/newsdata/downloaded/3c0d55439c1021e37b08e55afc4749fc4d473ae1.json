REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nMetro stations reopened after some were closed on Sunday amid sometimes violent confrontations, although the mood in the Asian financial hub remained tense.\n\nEarly on Monday, before school started, rows of students and alumni joined hands chanting \u201cHong Kong people, add oil\u201d, a phrase which has become a rallying cry of encouragement for the protest movement.\n\n\u201cThe school-based human chain is the strongest showcase of how this protest is deep rooted in society, so deep rooted that it enters through the school students,\u201d said Alan Leong, an alumnus of Wah Yan College in the city\u2019s Kowloon district.\n\nThree months of protests over a now withdrawn extradition bill have evolved into a broader backlash against the government and greater calls for democracy.\n\nThe former British colony is facing its first recession in a decade as the protests scare off tourists and bite into retail sales in one of the world\u2019s most popular shopping destinations.\n\nTourist arrivals plunged 40% in August year on year, said Paul Chan, the city\u2019s finance secretary, with sustained clashes leading to main roads being shrouded in teargas and blocked, and the international airport shut down - hitting the tourism, retail and hotel industries.\n\n\u201cThe most worrying thing is that the road ahead is not easily going to turn any better,\u201d Chan said in his blog on Sunday, noting that some hotels had seen room rates plunge up to 70%.\n\nActivists started fires in the street and vandalized a Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station in the main business district of Central on Sunday after thousands rallied peacefully at the U.S. consulate, calling for help in bringing democracy to the special administrative region.\n\nThe students, brandishing posters with the protesters\u2019 five demands for the government, called on authorities to respond to the promises of freedom, human rights and rule of law.University students were also expected to join the human chain protests during the day on their campuses.\n\nOne of the five demands - to formally withdraw the extradition bill - was announced last week by the city government leader, Carrie Lam, but protesters are angry about her failure to call an independent inquiry into accusations of police brutality during demonstrations.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 other demands include the retraction of the word \u201criot\u201d to describe demonstrations, the release of all those arrested and the right for Hong Kong people to choose their own leaders.\n\n\u2018CRUSHED\u2019\n\nIn a rare public appearance, Lam walked around the central business district with the city\u2019s Transport and Housing Secretary Frank Chan and MTR officials to inspect the damaged station, where she chatted with staff and commuters.\n\nDressed in a black suit, she examined electronic ticketing machines and boarded up windows smashed the previous day, the public broadcaster RTHK showed.\n\nFollowing the demonstration at the U.S. consulate on Sunday, Hong Kong\u2019s government warned foreign lawmakers not to interfere in the city\u2019s internal affairs after thousands of protesters called on U.S. President Donald Trump to \u201cliberate\u201d the city.\n\nHong Kong returned to China in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland. Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling in the city and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of the damage to the economy.\n\nChinese state media on Monday said Hong Kong was an inseparable part of China and any form of secessionism \u201cwill be crushed\u201d.\n\nThe China Daily newspaper said Sunday\u2019s rally was proof foreign forces were behind the protests and warned demonstrators should \u201cstop trying the patience of the central government\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\nYoung pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong was released from police custody on Monday after breaching bail conditions following his arrest in August when he was charged along with a number of other prominent activists for inciting and participating in an unauthorized assembly.\n\nA senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was monitoring events in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cThe freedoms of expression and assembly are core values that we share with the people of Hong Kong, and those freedoms must be vigorously protected. As the president has said, \u2018They\u2019re looking for democracy and I think most people want democracy\u2019,\u201d the official said.", "description": "Hundreds of uniformed school students, many wearing masks, formed human chains in districts across Hong Kong on Monday in support of anti-government protesters after another weekend of clashes in the Chinese-ruled city.", "authors": ["Jessie Pang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427798661&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8806U", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
