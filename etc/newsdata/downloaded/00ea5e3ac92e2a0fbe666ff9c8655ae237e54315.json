The newspaper said the president had asked Scott Morrison to assist him in efforts to uncover how investigations of Russia began.\n\nIt said that as with Mr Trump\u2019s 25 July conversation with the leader of Ukraine, in which he asked him to dig up dirt on Mr Biden, an action that led Democrats to trigger impeachment probes, details of the president\u2019s conversation with Mr Morrison were also kept in a particularly secure server.\n\nAt the same time, the Washington Post said Mr Barr has sought the help of officials in Britain and Italy as he overseas several interrelated enquiries into the activities of the US intelligence community in 2016.\n\nJustice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Mr Trump made the calls to foreign leaders on Mr Barr\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe civil war comments came following a weekend in which Mr Trump and his allies fought back forcefully against the allegations from Democrats, and sought to frame the issue as one of Mr Biden\u2019s corruption not the president\u2019s.\n\nFor Mr Biden\u2019s campaign, Mr Giuliani\u2019s frequent TV appearances \u2013 in which he repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that Mr Biden\u2019s son was potentially involved in criminal activity in Ukraine \u2013 were a problem in themselves.\n\nOver the weekend, the campaign sent a letter to major networks in the US, and asked that the president\u2019s personal attorney not be invited back onto their channels as a result of those unsubstantiated accusations.\n\n\u201cWe are writing today with grave concern that you continue to book Rudy Giuliani on your air to spread false, debunked conspiracy theories on behalf of Donald Trump,\u201d the campaign wrote in an email to networks on Sunday. \u201cBy giving him your air time, you are allowing him to introduce increasingly unhinged, unfounded and desperate lies into the national conversation.\u201d", "description": "Two of Donald Trump\u2019s top lieutenants were dragged further into the rapidly unfolding\u00a0impeachment investigation on Monday \u2013 as Republicans distanced themselves from the president after he made a dark warning of a second US civil war.
