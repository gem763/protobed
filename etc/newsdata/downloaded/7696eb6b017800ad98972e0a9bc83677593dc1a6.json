Investors may soon find out", "language": "en", "text": "Is three the magic number for Wall Street? We\u2019ll soon find out. Only a few think that Jerome Powell & Co. will not cut interest rates next week for a third time in as many gatherings of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\n\nMarket-based probabilities imply a 93.5% chance of a quarter-of-a-percentage-point rate reduction to a 1.50%-1.75% range from the current 1.75%-2%, following the two-day Oct. 29-30 meeting, according to CME Group based on federal-funds futures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to the market that the Fed cuts rates next week because it is so widely expected \u2013 e.g. over 90% probability of a rate cut is implied by the Fed-funds futures at this point,\u201d Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Independent Advisor Alliance, told MarketWatch in emailed comments on Friday.\n\nHowever, disappointment from the Fed isn\u2019t outside the realm of possibility, despite the lofty expectations for a third cut on Wednesday, particularly as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.41% finished Friday\u2019s action roughly 0.1% from its July 26 record at 3,025.86, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.70% wrapped up the session within 2% of their all-time highs.\n\nMoreover, consensus for back-to-back-to-back rate cuts seems far from assured from a Fed that revealed its deepest divide since 2016, with Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George preferring to leave rates unchanged, among three members dissenting at last month\u2019s policy meeting. And a handful of the members who opted to cut last month communicated that they weren\u2019t eager for another reduction.\n\nThis current round of monetary-policy easing was described as a mid-cycle adjustment by Fed Chairman Powell earlier this year, a strategy that has been implemented in the past to preempt slowdowns and this time is being used to combat the negative effects of a nasty China-U. S. trade conflict.\n\nExperts say that a third cut matches the definition of a mid-cycle shift and could be justified as further insurance as a recession that appears to be emerging in Europe is creeping up on the U.S.\n\nKeith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services, pointed to a trio of rate cuts in 1995 and 1998 as parallels for the current monetary tactic.\n\n\u201cActually, both 1995 (which Powell has often talked about in a favorable light) and 1998 both saw three 25 basis point rate cuts and then the Fed stopped; these are both largely looked at as mid-cycle adjustments or for insurance reasons, especially 1995,\u201d the SunTrust strategist said.\n\nLerner added: \u201cTo your point about the division within the FOMC, Powell is likely not going to want to put the Fed in a box.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suspect he will discuss that the Fed has cut rates to support the economy and now the Fed will watch the data and he may focus on the term \u2018data dependent.\u2019 Monetary policy works with a lag and some of the recent cuts are still working their way into the economy,\u201d he explained.\n\nStill, a failure to deliver a cut won\u2019t be met kindly by investors.\n\n\u201cIf the Fed were to disappoint the markets by not cutting next week, I think we could see a pullback of anywhere from 3-5%, but it all depends on how the Fed communicates their decision,\u201d IAA\u2019s Zaccarelli said.\n\nTo be sure, signs of softness (and outright weakness) swirling around in the U.S. economy abound.\n\n\u201cThe combination of elevated trade uncertainty and softer global growth continues to act as a powerful brake on business spending with core durable goods orders momentum falling further into negative territory in September,\u201d wrote economists Lydia Boussour and Gregory Draco at Oxford Economics in a Friday research report.\n\nIndeed, a decline in orders for long-lasting goods over the past 12 months steepened to 5.4%, representing the biggest yearly drop-off since the middle of 2016, and reflecting a broadening decline in manufacturing activity.\n\nGiven that, the Oxford economists believe that the Fed won\u2019t resist a desire to cut rates despite growing worries about bubbles forming in other parts of financial markets.\n\n\u201cDespite some hints from Fed officials that it may be time to contemplate a rate cut pause, we believe the FOMC leadership retains its easing bias and remains attune to the risk of an unwanted tightening in financial conditions,\u201d\n\nJobs, jobs, jobs\u2026and a flood of other data\n\nIt isn\u2019t just about the Fed next week either. Arguably, an even more significant update will be the Friday jobs report that will roll out on Nov. 1. Economists are expecting that 93,000 jobs created in October, versus a disappointing 136,000 increase in September, reflecting payroll growth and the impact of strikes at General Motors Co. GM, +2.57%, according to Econoday data. Consensus estimates place the unemployment rate at 3.6%, up from 3.5% last month.\n\nHere\u2019s what the rest of the week looks like on the data front (bolded for significance):\n\nMonday:\n\nInternational trade in goods at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time , as well as Chicago Fed National Activity index, and retail inventories at the same time\n\n, as well as Chicago Fed National Activity index, and retail inventories at the same time Dallas Fed manufacturing survey\n\nTuesday\n\nCase-Shiller home-price index at 9 a.m.\n\nConsumer confidence at 10 a.m., along with pending home sales at the same time\n\nWednesday\n\nADP private-sector employment at 8:15 a.m.\n\nGDP report at 8:30 a.m.\n\n2 p.m. Fed decision, followed by a 2:30 p.m. news conference\n\nThursday\n\nA report on weekly jobless claims, a reading on personal income and employment cost at 8:30 a.m.\n\nChicago PMI at 9:45 a.m.\n\nFriday\n\nNFP at 8:30 a.m. (as mentioned above)\n\n(as mentioned above) ISM manufacturing at 10 a.m., coming after the IHS Markit report at 9:45 a.m.\n\nA report on construction spending at 10 a.m.\n\nBig corporate earnings highlights\n\nMonday\n\nTuesday\n\nWednesday\n\nThursday\n\nFriday", "description": "A scant few think that Jerome Powell & Co. will opt not to cut interest rates next week for a third time in as many gatherings of the rate-setting...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HL957_arends_ZG_20190621175131.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
