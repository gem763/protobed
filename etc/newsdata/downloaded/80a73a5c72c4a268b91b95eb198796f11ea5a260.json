When you sense the oneness, you are with us,\u201d narrates Academy Award-winning actress Brie Larson, as shots of the Earth as seen from space zoom into to sweeping close-ups of waterfalls and moss. \u201cWe brought life to Earth. You can\u2019t see us, but we flourish all around you, everywhere, in everything, and even inside you.\u201d A pregnant pause. \u201cWhether you believe in us or not.\u201d Over a musical crescendo, Larson quickens the delivery of her lines, building up to the big reveal: \u201cWe are creation, we are resurrection, condemnation and regeneration. We are mushrooms.\u201d\n\nThe 74-minute film works to prove to viewers that the mushrooms and fungi beneath our feet live up to these promises in the dramatic (and at times seemingly hyperbolic) introduction. Through interviews with experts and breathtaking close-up shots that offer a totally new perspective of the tiniest, most overlooked residents of the forest floor, Fantastic Fungi illustrates the fundamental connection between humans and mycelium.\n\nProducers interviewed renowned mycologist Paul Stamets, who is quite the celebrity in the magic mushroom world for his popular TED Talk entitled \u201c6 Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World.\u201d They also spoke to Michael Pollan, author of The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, food naturalist Eugenia Bone, and doctor and alternative medicine advocate Andrew Weil, among others.\n\nFungi, the film argues, are an essential tool in feeding and nourishing us, with the potential to promote both therapeutic and physical solutions to a variety of health issues. Doctors and participants from psilocybin studies attest to the profound positive effects of single doses of mushrooms on mental health. While fungus is often associated with death and decomposition, it also, crucially, \u201cgenerates soil that gives life.\u201d\n\nThe director, Louie Schwartzberg, uses time lapse effects to \u201cmake the invisible visible,\u201d capturing enchanting visual spectacles from fungi growing into toadstools straight from the pages of a storybook, to the grotesquely fascinating decomposition process of a mouse corpse. These time lapse shots are some of the most compelling moments of the film, providing an eye-level view of the processes that we rarely get to see for ourselves.\n\nImages of crystalline snow melting to uncover pinecone and dew-dappled white mushrooms springing from the soil, revealing their grooved underbellies, would not look out of place in a fantasy film. It is during these sequences that the tiny subjects most believably embody the power and wonder with which they are described in the opening.\n\nThe documentary is packed with fascinating facts of the sort that one might deploy to impress guests at a dinner party. Plants, for example, can recognize their own kin in the way that humans form attachments to family members, according to ecology professor Suzanne Simard. Trees swap nutrients with one another using mycelium as a pathway, and through these networks, \u201cmother\u201d trees are able to identify and communicate with their seedlings.\n\n\u201c You can\u2019t see us, but we flourish all around you, everywhere, in everything, and even inside you. \u201d\n\nWhile much of Fantastic Fungi is devoted to waxing poetic about the health benefits of varying types of fungi, it would not be a documentary about mushrooms without covering psychedelic experiences. By way of introduction to the subject, Schwartzberg presents a slightly disorienting animated rendering of hairy, nonverbal early hominids gathered around a fire, tripping on psilocybin mushrooms. Stamets\u2014wearing a blue baseball hat with a mushroom on it the way one shows allegiance to a favorite sports team\u2014then divulges his first experience with magic mushrooms.\n\n\u201cWhen I was in Ohio, I actually purchased a bag of magic mushrooms,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut I had no guide, I had no recommendations for how much to consume. So, I had a bag about this big, so I thought, \u2018Well, this is probably one dose,\u2019 so I consumed the bag. Now, for those of you who don\u2019t know, this is like ten times more than you probably need to consume.\u201d Off to a great start, Paul! What could have easily been a bad trip, however, turned out to be a life-changing experience for young Stamets.\n\n\u201cThere was a beautiful big, big tree, an oak tree,\u201d he continues, \u201cand then I noticed black clouds on the horizon, and I realized there was a storm coming and I thought, \u2018This is great. I\u2019ll have this great visual of a storm coming,\u2019 and I thought, \u2018I\u2019m going to climb to the top of the tree.\u2019\u201d So far, teenage Paul is still demonstrating A+ logic.\n\nAs he describes a lightning storm of biblical proportions, which he was watching from the top of a tree, I was sure that this story would not have a happy ending. But instead of focusing on his fear, Stamets chose to channel his energy into overcoming his embarrassing stuttering problem. \u201cAnd so, I thought, \u2018I need to stop stuttering,\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI said to myself, \u2018Stop stuttering. Stop stuttering now.\u2019\u201d The very next day, when a pretty girl he had a crush on said hello to him, Stamets was able to give an unwavering, stutter-free reply for the first time in his life.
