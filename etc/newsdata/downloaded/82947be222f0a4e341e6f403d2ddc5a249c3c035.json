Nixon, who\u2019d been entangled in the Watergate scandal for two years, announced his resignation the next day.\n\nCould a similar drama unfold in later stages of the impeachment process that Democrats have now initiated against President Donald Trump? It\u2019s doubtful. In Nixon\u2019s time, there were conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans. Compromise was not treated with scorn.\n\nIn today\u2019s highly polarized Washington, bipartisan agreement is a rarity. And Trump has taken over the Republican Party, accruing personal rather than party loyalty and casting the GOP establishment to an ineffectual sideline.\n\n\u201cIn the past in the U.S., party members would dissociate themselves from disgraced leaders in order to preserve the party and their own reputations,\u201d said professor Nick Smith, who teaches ethics and political philosophy at the University of New Hampshire. \u201cBut now President Trump seems to have such a personal hold on the party - more like a cult leader than a U.S. president - that the exits are closed as the party transforms into his image.\u201d\n\nThe delegation that visited Nixon was headed by Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the GOP\u2019s unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1964. Goldwater, who had a long tenure as a party elder, was joined by Sen. Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, a Republican known for his strong support for civil rights, and Rep. John Rhodes of Arizona - the GOP leaders in their respective chambers.\n\nThey told Nixon there were no longer enough Republican votes to spare him from impeachment, given the release two days earlier of a 1972 tape recording contradicting Nixon\u2019s tenacious denial of any role in cover-up of the Watergate break-in.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d been proclaiming his innocence and suddenly they\u2019ve got this evidence showing he\u2019s been lying all this time,\u201d said Thomas Schwartz, a history and political science professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the equivalent of that now.\u201d\n\nFor now, though, Trump has a firewall in the form of Republicans who see more harm in opposing him than supporting him. Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, cited the increased political polarization of recent years as a reason why most Republican officials will stick with Trump \u201cas long as their own status is not in danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the president\u2019s partisans in Congress, it\u2019s \u2018our guy on his worst day is better than your guy on his best day,\u2019\u201d Jillson said. \u201cThey stick with him to get the judicial appointments, the tax cuts.\u201d\n\nThat would change if Trump\u2019s troubles become so serious that congressional leaders think it will affect them and their party, Jillson said.\n\n\u201cEveryone among the Republicans in Congress has a beef with the president but they\u2019re afraid of him,\u201d said Jillson. \u201cIf he weakens, that fear will subside.\u201d\n\nThe Watergate scandal overlapped with late stages of the Vietnam War, which had bedeviled both Nixon and his Democratic predecessor, Lyndon Johnson. In that era, Congress was more powerful in relation to the executive branch than it is now, with more leaders of national stature, several experts suggested.\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Center, suggested that with the death last year of Arizona Sen. John McCain, there\u2019s no Republican currently in Congress who could replicate Goldwater\u2019s 1974 role.\n\n\u201cWho would go and be credible with Donald Trump, so that he would listen?\u201d she asked. \u201cMitt Romney? Mitch McConnell? Lindsay Graham? Trump will turn on any of them the minute they say something uncongenial.\u201d\n\nA key then-and-now difference, Jamieson said, is that Goldwater represented the same conservative constituency as Nixon and conveyed the message that Nixon was losing its support.\n\nTrump, she said, has a different relationship with his base than Nixon did with his: The base is loyal to Trump personally, rather than to a party establishment.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s first two years in office, one of the few Republicans in Congress to tangle regularly with him was Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who decided not to seek reelection in 2018. In a column in The Washington Post on Oct. 1, Flake lambasted his fellow Republicans still in Congress for failure to break with Trump and oppose his reelection.\n\n\u201cAt this point, the president\u2019s conduct in office should not surprise us. But truly devastating has been our tolerance of that conduct,\u201d Flake wrote. \u201cFrom the ordeal of this presidency, perhaps the most horrible - and lasting - effect on our democracy will be that at some point we simply stopped being shocked.\u201d\n\nDavid Gibbs, a political science professor at the University of Arizona, recalled that Nixon had won reelection by a landslide in 1972, and yet many people who supported him, including Republicans in Congress, were willing to turn against him as evidence of a Watergate conspiracy accumulated.\n\nIn contrast, Gibbs now sees the United States as divided 50-50 along the \u201ctribal lines\u201d of Democrats versus Republicans, with Trump\u2019s base remaining loyal no matter what sort of negative picture is painted by his critics.\n\n\u201cThe two sides are roughly evenly matched, with neither one able to deliver a knockout blow, and thus there\u2019s political paralysis,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThe hyper-partisan tribalism makes bipartisan consensus for removing a president virtually impossible.\u201d\n\nAnother big change since 1974 is the proliferation of media outlets and the advent of social media, which is used by Trump himself and partisans on all sides to promote their agendas and demonize opponents. Nixon had neither the equivalent of Fox News to support him nor the soapbox of Twitter to accuse his detractors of treason and witch-hunting.\n\nThe changing media landscape \u201chas resulted in a political and news environment that moves at light speed compared with the Watergate era,\u201d said David Cohen, a University of Akron political science professor. \u201cThe sheer information we are inundated with daily is like drinking out of a fire hose and it is impossible to swallow it all.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "On Aug. 7, 1974, three top Republican leaders in Congress paid a solemn visit to President Richard Nixon at the White House, bearing the message that he faced near-certain impeachment due to eroding support in his own party on Capitol Hill.
