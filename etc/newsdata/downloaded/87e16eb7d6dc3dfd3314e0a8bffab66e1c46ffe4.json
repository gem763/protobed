The scrum-half had Ed Fidow to beat but got a helpful bounce off the Samoa wing's backside and stumbled over the line to score.\n\nScotland's tails were up now and they added to their lead three minutes before the break as Hogg nailed a massive 40-yard drop goal to become the first Scot to do so since Duncan Weir's last-minute winner against Italy in 2014.\n\nThey would have loved a third try in stoppage time but Samoa did just enough to survive surge after Scottish surge.\n\nScotland had won most of the collisions but started the second half going backwards as the Pacific Islanders fired out of the traps.\n\nBut the Dark Blues' pack soon regained control, with their pressure bringing about a penalty try after 57 minutes as Fidow was yellow carded for illegally dragging down a rolling maul as substitute hooker Fraser Brown tried to ram his way over the whitewash.\n\nThat left plenty time to chase the fourth touchdown and the precious bonus point.\n\nAnd it came with six minutes left. Maitland was released out wide by Duncan Taylor and immediately put his head down and charged for the line. He dived early, but was prevented from reaching the line by Fidow's illegal knee-first tackle.\n\nReferee Pascal Gauzere saw the challenge for what it was and flashed a second yellow - followed by red - at the Samoan wing before awarding the penalty try to the Scots' delight.", "description": "Scotland answered their critics in impressive fashion as Gregor Townsend's men grabbed a bonus-point win over Samoa to fire themselves back into contention for the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals.
