Most importantly, the report concludes Comey improperly released FBI material in order to launch the Special Counsel investigation into the 2016 presidential election. This report is separate from the highly anticipated IG report about the origins of the Russia investigation and FISA abuse.\n\nThe report also found that Comey \"set a dangerous example\" for the FBI because of his leaked conversations with President Trump.\n\n\"By not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees\u2014and the many thousands more former FBI employees\u2014who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.\" emphasis added\n\nSo the question is, why did Comey, an educated man who had served in the FBI for a number of years, think it was okay that he more or less steal these memos and subsequently leak the substance of them?\n\nWell, based on the IG report it sounds like he knew what he was doing was wrong, but he thought it would be better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission. He said he simply loved his country too much to bother asking for approval:\n\n\"When asked whether he considered that his disclosure of this information would significantly affect FBI equities, he told the OIG that he would \u201cframe it differently\u201d as an issue of \u201cincredible importance to the Nation, as a whole.\u201d Comey said he took the actions he took because he \u201cwas doing\u2026something I [had] to do if I love this country\u2026and I love the Department of Justice, and I love the FBI.\u201d Comey told the OIG that notifying the FBI and Department of Justice about his plans before disclosing the contents of Memo 4 was not something he could do \u201cif I care about the Country.\u201d Comey said that he did not want to put the leadership of the FBI \u201cin an impossible position\u201d by notifying them ahead of time because if he asked them to approve what he was planning to do, \u201cthey'd have to tell the leadership of the Department of Justice that the\u2026former Director is contemplating doing this\u201d and Comey believed it was \u201cbetter that [he] not engage them.\u201d76 Accordingly, Comey stated that he did not notify anyone at the FBI that he was going to share the contents of the Memo 4 with Richman or the media, and that he did not seek authorization from FBI to provide Memo 4 to Richman.\" emphasis added\n\nComey took unprecedented actions, knew what he was doing would not be approved, yet continued to do so anyways. He thinks himself a hero, but as the DOJ said, he \"failed\" to live up to the \"responsibility to protect sensitive law enforcement information\" that all FBI employees must honor even when they \"believe that their most strongly-held personal convictions might be served by an unauthorized disclosure, the FBI depends on them not to disclose sensitive information.\" What a hack.", "description": "What a hack..09/02/2019 3:15:24AM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/165/d05e56b7-e15a-483c-a0e0-451a94f08cb9.jpg"}
