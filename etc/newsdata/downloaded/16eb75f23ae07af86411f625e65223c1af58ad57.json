(AP) - Years one and two were for building. Bobby Hurley needed time to set the foundation and standards at Arizona State, recruit the right players.\n\nThe third and fourth years were for taking the next step, winning more, establishing a tradition, reaching the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThe Sun Devils want the progression to continue this season, toward a Pac-12 title, a deeper NCAA run, possibly a Final Four.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve positioned ourselves well,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cNo one in the Pac-12\u2019s going to care that we\u2019re the only Pac-12 school to go to the tournament the last two years. It\u2019s a clean slate as far as I\u2019m concerned, but I do take a lot of pride in that. It\u2019s been a big climb. We have a bunch of guys in the locker room that know how to do that and expect to do that. That\u2019s kind of the standard now.\u201d\n\nHurley arrived in the desert after a quick turnaround at Buffalo, where he led the Bulls to the program\u2019s first NCAA Tournament in his second season.\n\nWith players mostly recruited by previous coach Herb Sendek, Hurley led Arizona State to 15 wins in each of his first two seasons. The Sun Devils ended a three-year NCAA Tournament drought by earning a spot in the 2018 First Four and were back in Dayton last season after another anxious wait on Selection Sunday.\n\nThe Sun Devils won their first NCAA Tournament game in a decade by beating St. John\u2019s in the First Four last season before losing to Hurley\u2019s former team, Buffalo.\n\nNow they want more.\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019ve done a good amount, I\u2019m still not satisfied, I still want to make it further,\u201d Arizona State junior guard Remy Martin said. \u201cFor those guys that left, they did great but we\u2019re here now and we\u2019ve got to figure out how to win.\u201d\n\nHurley\u2019s program building has put the Sun Devils in a good position to make a deeper run.\n\nArizona State lost Luguentz Dort and Zylan Cheatham, two of its best defenders and rebounders, but has a strong core coming back. Martin and Rob Edwards, who\u2019s healthy after suffering back problems a year ago, anchor the backcourt. Romello White, Taeshon Cherry and Kimani Lawrence return in the frontcourt.\n\nHurley has complemented them with three top-level junior college recruits and a solid recruiting class headed by Jaelen House, son of former Arizona State star Eddie House.\n\nThe Sun Devils should be able to play multiple styles, whether it\u2019s the high-scoring, up-tempo game of what was dubbed \u201cGuard U\u201d two seasons ago or working the ball inside when they need to like last year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re interchangeable, we have a lot of different ways we can go,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m noticing and I like. There\u2019s a lot of different combinations.\u201d\n\nArizona State will have a shorter practice window to pull everything together.\n\nAs part of the Pac-12 Global initiative, the Sun Devils will travel to China, where they\u2019ll play an exhibition against a Chinese team and against Colorado in a non-Pac-12 game. Arizona State leaves on Nov. 1 and will spend a week in China, leaving the Sun Devils less time to prepare for the season.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the shortest preseason I have had,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cWe have done a great job of getting off to a fast start the last two years so I\u2019m hopeful that we\u2019re getting better every day.\u201d\n\nHurley and the Sun Devils hope the trend of getting better every year continues, too.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Years one and two were for building.
