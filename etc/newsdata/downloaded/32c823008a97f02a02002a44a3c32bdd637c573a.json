The Teal Pumpkin Project allows his to enjoy Halloween.\n\nIt's hard to ignore moms fighting for their kids.\n\nThat's why we asked two mamas who have kids with dietary restrictions to explain the importance of the Teal Pumpkin Project \u2014 a mission that encourages people to place teal pumpkins on their doorsteps to signify that they are offering treats other than candy for Halloween.\n\nThe project started in 2014 and is promoted by the Food Allergy Research and Education organization.\n\nChelsea Baker Snare's 2-year-old son Jackson has a tree nut allergy. Foods that contain nuts or have been processed in a facility containing nuts can make him really sick. For some kids, it can be deadly.

The rare disorder tricks his brain into thinking his body is starving and overeating could lead to obesity-related complications.

Here are some really cool and easy non-food treats you can offer Halloween trick-or-treaters.\n\nJackson's favorite is Play-Doh and Evan loves glow sticks.\n\nMom Natalie Brennenman provides a bowl of non-food treats for trick-or-treaters as part of the Teal Pumpkin Project.
