Now, over two years after 2017\u2019s Dead Men Tell No Tales seemingly brought the franchise to rest in its watery grave, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney has hired screenwriter Ted Elliott to develop a new Pirates adventure. Elliott, who co-wrote The Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man\u2019s Chest, At World\u2019s End and On Stranger Tides with Terry Rossio, will now be joined by Chernobyl\u2019s Craig Mazin. While Mazin is the creator of the Emmy-winning HBO miniseries, he also co-wrote Scary Movie 3, and if you ask us, the best Pirates movies fall exactly in between those two properties.\n\nAs for whether or not the proposed reboot will include Pirates of the Caribbean character/main attraction Jack Sparrow, heretofore played by Johnny Depp, well, it\u2019s unclear. The film is so early in the development process, Elliott and Mazin are reportedly just working on \u201ca direction\u201d and \u201ca story,\u201d which we can probably assume will be \u201cout to sea\u201d and \u201csomething having to do with a ship and a vengeful oceanic antagonist of some sort.\u201d", "description": "Chernobyl creator Craig Mazin is now co-writing a Pirates of the Caribbean reboot with franchise vet Ted Elliott for Disney.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2017/08/07/12-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
