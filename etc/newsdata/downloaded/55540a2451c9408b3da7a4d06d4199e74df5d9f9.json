Four experts share their tips on putting the fun back into family, at every age\n\nCould we go down in history as the generation that forgot to enjoy our kids? It\u2019s a shocking indictment, but the evidence is mounting: recent research found that parents become happier when their children have left home, while another study earlier this year found that working mothers with two children are 40% more stressed than anyone else. Meanwhile, Australian academics report that the pressures on parents mount after a second child, and that there are accompanying deteriorations in parents\u2019 mental health.\n\nAnd, as a two-year-old could probably tell you, stressed-out, unhappy parents raise stressed-out, unhappy offspring. The UK\u2019s annual Good Childhood report, out last month, found there are more unhappy youngsters now than at any point in the past decade.\n\nIt feels like a good time to ask whether there\u2019s a better way \u2013 and common sense tells us that it starts with parents, because if we can find the joy in raising our kids, our kids are more likely to find the joy in life. Somewhere along the way, parenting became just another chore on the list for already exhausted, up-against-it individuals.\n\nI\u2019ve sought the wisdom of some of the world\u2019s leading parenting gurus, on how we can rediscover the joy of raising children at every age. Because who wants to wait till they\u2019re gone?\n\nThe baby years\n\nPhilippa Perry is a psychotherapist and the author of The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read. She says a major key to happier parenting is to simply take \u201cparenting\u201d out of the equation \u2013 because having a baby is more about being a human being in the throes of developing a new relationship. And thinking about it in that way will help you find the joy in it. \u201cDon\u2019t see a baby as a chore, or parenting him or her as something you have to \u2018do\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, see the child as someone to relate to.\u201d Be curious about your baby as a person, and revel in his or her curiosity about you.\n\nYou also need to readjust, says psychologist Penelope Leach; it will be hard to find the joy in babyhood if you have unrealistic expectations. Leach, the bestselling author of Your Baby And Child, first published in 1977 and out in a new edition next year, says, \u201cThe mistake people make is to think they can get \u2018back to normal\u2019, but in fact there\u2019s a whole new normal. And once you know everything is going to be different, it\u2019s easier to find the pleasure in the new life you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s an important tip from Rosalind Wiseman, whose Queen Bees And Wannabes, which examined female teenhood, was the basis for the 2004 movie Mean Girls: \u201cStop taking endless pictures of your baby and posting them online. Be in the moment with them and stop seeing them in relation to how you\u2019re going to look on social media. It fans competitive parenting, which is the source of a lot of unhappiness.\u201d\n\nIf you do one thing, do this Be aware that your baby is not an accessory to your life; he or she is a new person, and together you are forging a relationship that will last a lifetime.\n\nThe preschool era\n\nIt\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of worrying that your child is falling behind, or that they are wasting opportunities to get ahead. Nothing is guaranteed to kill the fun of parenting as quickly as obsessing over how fast they\u2019re learning, and how they compare with other kids of your acquaintance. \u201cIf you think about what you can learn from your child, rather than what you have to teach them, parenting becomes much better,\u201d says Perry.\n\nTry to live as they do, in the present, as much as you can, because this is the last time in their childhood when they won\u2019t be tied down by the rigid timetable of the school day. \u201cThe more flexible you can be, the more you\u2019re going to enjoy this phase of their lives,\u201d says Leach. \u201cNot having a rigid idea about how the day will work out is helpful, if you can do it. So, when you hear the bells on the ice-cream van, stop what you\u2019re doing and go get an ice-cream.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in danger of missing our children in the moment, because we\u2019re in too much of a rush the entire time,\u201d agrees Perry.\n\nSteve Biddulph, a psychologist best known for his books on raising boys, agrees: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, how much chasing around parks, flying kites or eating ice-creams on the beach would we do, without kids to do them with?\u201d he asks. \u201cHow much belly-laughing and bad joke-telling or scrunching up on the couch?\u201d They\u2019re capable of showing us how to have fun, but only if we pay attention.\n\nSorting your own demons out always makes your relationship with your child a whole lot better\n\nIf you\u2019re constantly comparing your kid with others, try looking at yourself rather than your child for a better way forward. Competitiveness always has its roots in our own insecurities \u2013 and valuing children for themselves, rather than in relation to others, is much more likely to help you appreciate them and, in turn, boost their self-confidence.\n\nWhat is it about your own insecurities that is driving your competitiveness? Sorting your own demons out always makes your relationship with your child a lot better. The therapy I had when I was undergoing treatment for breast cancer made me realise that I had a right to own my feelings, that I could have a story that was separate from my life as a mother. Understanding my fears better helped in the way I interacted with my daughters, and that made me a better parent.\n\nIf you do one thing, do this Be open to their way of doing things.\n\nThe primary school period\n\nBoundaries are important, says Perry: but what you need to think about in laying them down is, what\u2019s going to make you happy? Because if you\u2019re happy, they\u2019re happy. She advises parents to be more honest with kids of primary school age. \u201cIf you\u2019re at the playground and you want to go home, instead of saying: \u2018Let\u2019s get you home, you need your tea,\u2019 tell it like it is: \u2018Let\u2019s go home now, because I\u2019m cold and I\u2019ve had enough.\u2019\u201d Your child, she says, will know what it feels like to be cold, and they want to help.\n\nA gem from Biddulph is to develop interests that you do one-to-one with them, and make them entirely for fun (there may be some learning on the side, but make sure that\u2019s accidental rather than the point). \u201cA daughter who walks the dog with her dad, for example, develops a cast-iron self-esteem because she knows \u2018me and dad\u2019 love one another\u2019s company. You need ritual times when the good talks happen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important not to take their criticism personally. Honestly. Kids lay into their parents because we\u2019re right there, and we\u2019re easy targets. Practise Teflon parenting: let the criticisms slide off you and you\u2019ll be happier.\n\nThe most common time for divorce is around 12 years after getting married, so primary school is prime time for relationship breakups. At this stage there\u2019s still a lot of heavy-duty parenting to go, and you need to go on enjoying it \u2013 for the kids\u2019 sake and yours. Leach\u2019s advice is to keep in mind that \u201cjust because you found your partner in bed with your best friend, it doesn\u2019t mean he \u2013 or she \u2013 isn\u2019t the great dad or mum you believed they were\u201d. It may be the hardest ask of your life, but keeping on good terms with your ex is the best recipe for keeping the fun in parenting.\n\nIf you do one thing, do this Make space for your relationship with your child to grow by having regular one-on-one time, doing something you both enjoy: no siblings, no partners, just the two of you.\n\nThe not-so-terrible teens\n\nAlthough they\u2019re much maligned, it\u2019s misplaced: teens (like toddlers) are a high point of parenting for many of us who have been there.\n\n\u201cOne of the big joys for me as a parent of teenagers is the realisation that they\u2019re able to do so much to contribute,\u201d says Wiseman. \u201cOne of my sons regularly cooks for us, and loves it, and the other will help by going to the shops.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s so much to enjoy about having a teenager, if you\u2019re tuned in to it. \u201cI love their sense of humour, their honesty, their appropriate cynicism, their intense viewpoints,\u201d she says. \u201cTeenagers are really interesting people, as long as you don\u2019t judge and go in with an attitude of respect.\u201d\n\n'Don't wait': how to talk to teenagers about porn Read more\n\n\u201cI loved having a kitchen full of teenagers,\u201d says Perry, whose daughter is now 28. As do I right now. So learn to enjoy the drop-of-a-hat parties, the dancing in the kitchen, and the friends who keep turning up. \u201cOur children give us a connection right back into the juice and intensity of being alive,\u201d says Biddulph. \u201cWe\u2019re creaking, dried-up worriers, and they are straight from the heart of life.\u201d\n\nIf you do one thing, do this Be clear about your own needs, as well as theirs \u2013 it\u2019s a two-way street.\n\nAll grown up\n\n\u201cMy parents always thought they were the grownups and we were the children, even when we were in our 50s,\u201d says Perry. \u201cBut with my daughter I don\u2019t: I feel we\u2019re both adults. And she helps me such a lot \u2013 she keeps me up to date.\u201d I second that: would I be listening to Loyle Carner, trying barre classes, selling my clothes on Depop or drinking kombucha if I didn\u2019t have adult kids?\n\nThey also go on to lead exciting lives that you can dip into: my eldest daughter, 27, lives by a canal in Amsterdam, which gives me an excuse for weekends away. Their world opens up your world, widening the horizons of your midlife.\n\nThere\u2019s one caveat, cautions Perry. \u201cThe one thing you always have to remember is that your opinion matters more to them than anyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nIf you do one thing, do this Respect the adults they have become. It\u2019s not about telling them what to do any more, if indeed it ever was. And you certainly can\u2019t change them now.\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).", "description": "A recent report found parents are happier when their children leave home \u2013 but why wait?
