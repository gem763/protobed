All are larger than average, too.\n\nStill, nothing on the menu quite rivals the ceviches. They are served, yes, without lettuce or rice, and they are better for it. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s creative engine seems to have a high idle, and he has come up with different ways to present dishes that are also on the menu at the fast-casual counters. The \u201cNikkei\u201d ceviche, for instance \u2014 tuna in a kind of modified ponzu sauce seasoned with aj\u00ed amarilllo and togarashi \u2014 now comes with watermelon and a bloop of ginger foam that would never survive a trip from the food court back to the office. Neither would the odd but intriguing attempt at a vegetarian ceviche where the fish is replaced by shiitakes and the leche de tigre takes the form of snow, frozen by liquid nitrogen.\n\nThe art of ceviche-making has at least as much in common with mixology as with cooking, so it is no surprise that the cocktails are well calibrated and sing out with fresh lime. There is a twist on the pisco sour made with passion-fruit juice and another with the purple-corn drink chicha morada, although neither quite achieves the bracing elegance of the original. And it\u2019s nice to see the less well-known chilcano, a pisco highball made with lime juice and ginger ale. (Would ginger beer be better?)\n\nChicha morada appears again in the raspadilla dessert. This time it is a syrup poured over shaved ice and sprinkled with lucuma foam. When I had the raspadilla, it was sprinkled with candied pecan crumbs but in a phone interview on Monday Mr. Ch\u00e1vez said he had replaced the nuts with crumbled Oreos. This, it hardly needs pointing out, was not exactly a staple in the diet of the Incas.\n\n\u201cWhat can I say?\u201d he asked. \u201cI just really like Oreos.\u201d\n\nFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
