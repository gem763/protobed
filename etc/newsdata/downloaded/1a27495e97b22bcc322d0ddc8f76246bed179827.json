Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the bill Saturday, which requires all children get the same meal, even if their family isn\u2019t up to date on their meal fees. The rule applies from kindergarten through 12th grade.\n\nThe bill was one of several newly-signed laws aimed at making the state\u2019s schools \u201cinclusive, accepting and welcoming of all kids,\u201d Newsom said. On Twitter TWTR, -1.44% he added, \u201cLunch shaming is very real and has serious consequences for the well-being of our kids. No more in CA.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s a small bite at a bigger problem, according to one expert.\n\n\u201cNo one should be taking a victory lap in the war against child hunger by banning the relatively rare practice that never should have been legal to begin with,\u201d said Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, a nonpartisan nonprofit that helps low-income families receive government benefits and advocates for hunger-ending public policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to ban lunch shaming symbolically and it\u2019s unacceptable this happens so much as once,\u201d he said. Yet \u201csometimes it\u2019s a little bit of a distraction from the far bigger issue\u201d of child hunger, he added.\n\nLunch shaming happens when kids are singled out with a different meal or denied food altogether because of unpaid school lunch fees.\n\nEarlier this year, one Rhode Island school district proposed serving a sunflower butter and jelly sandwich to kids who owed lunch money. (The district dropped the idea in the face of backlash from the public, according to the Associated Press.)\n\nNewsom signed the bill four months after Ryan Kyote, a 9-year-old Napa third grader, donated his $74.80 in savings to pay off the lunch debts of fellow classmates at his elementary school.\n\nKyote paid up after hearing a news story about an Indiana kindergartner who reportedly had to return her hot lunch and take a peanut butter and jelly sandwich instead because her account didn\u2019t have enough money.\n\nCalifornia is now the largest state with rules prohibiting separate treatment at lunchtime for students with unpaid balances. New Mexico was the first state in the country to outlaw the practice, passing a law in 2017. Iowa and Oregon also have laws barring the practice.\n\nAlmost 1.5 million California children lived in households that didn\u2019t have steady access to nutritious food, a Hunger Free America report said, citing 2017 United States Department of Agriculture data.\n\nThat\u2019s 16.5% of the Golden State\u2019s youth population, the organization concluded. Between 2015 and 2017, an average of 12.8 million children nationwide \u2014 17.4% of all children in the country \u2014 lived in food insecure households, Hunger Free America said.\n\nSome public-health advocates say rates of food insecurity could worsen if the Trump administration follows through with a proposal to tighten eligibility rules on its food stamp program.\n\nSchool lunches are just part of the issue \u2014 breakfast is also important, Berg noted. Too few school districts do their best to encourage participation in school breakfast programs. If students show up early to claim the free meals at their schools in some districts, \u201cyou basically have to admit you\u2019re poor,\u201d which can stigmatize kids who seek out the benefit. Free breakfast programs have been shown to improve academic performance and attendance among some students.\n\nSome school districts \u2014 like the Los Angeles school system \u2014 bring the food right into the classroom, which Berg said was a good idea.\n\n\u201cNutritionally and medically, breakfast is arguably the most important meal of the day,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo be schooled, you must be fueled. To be well read, you must be well fed,\u201d he added.\n\nBerg pointed to a school breakfast scorecard the Food Research & Action Center, a national nonprofit organization working to eradicate poverty-related hunger and undernutrition in the U.S., issued for the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nJust over half (56.3%) of the 2.6 million California students receiving a free or reduced price lunch also had school breakfast, according to the organization\u2019s statistics. It ranked 26 in national participation rates.", "description": "California is now the largest state to ban separate school meals for students who have unpaid lunch tabs, but experts say this is just one way to help...", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT270_school_ZG_20191014150128.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
