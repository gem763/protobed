But the old adage of \u201cit\u2019s better to be safe than sorry\u201d rings true \u2013 no one who finds themselves in an emergency situation abroad expects it to happen to them.\n\nWe\u2019re all familiar with 911 in the U.S., but what number do you dial when you\u2019re in a foreign country? Emergency numbers around the world aren\u2019t something you want to be trying to figure out in the midst of extreme danger.\n\nIt only takes a few minutes to find the number that may save your or someone else\u2019s life, thus making it the one thing you should be adding to your phone before a trip abroad. Consider it part of your itinerary research process.\n\nWhen emergencies strike abroad:Here's what to do\n\nGet help:How to find an English-speaking doctor abroad\n\nEmergency numbers around the world\n\nClick through the gallery below to learn the emergency numbers for more than 70 countries or check this alphabetized State Department list for others.\n\nWhere else does 911 work? Canada and Mexico use the North American standard of 911, as do all American territories (Puerto Rico, American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands) and much of the Caribbean including Antigua & Barbuda, Aruba, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Bonaire, Belize, the Cayman Islands, the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Turks and Caicos. (Jamaica, however, does not. Dial 119 for police and 110 for fire and EMS there.)\n\nDial 112 in Europe: If you can only remember one number while traveling, make it 112. it's the European Union's equivalent to 911 and it's even been adopted in some non-EU countries like Russia, Switzerland, India and South Korea. It also works in the United Kingdom, along with the British version, 999.\n\nIf you're traveling to a country that doesn't use one general emergency number \u2013 or you don't think you will remember 112, store those numbers in your phone's contact list.\n\nTraveling alone as a woman?See The 10 safest (and most dangerous) countries\n\nWrite down or memorize the number, too\n\nOnce you have the emergency number for the country you\u2019re visiting, take the time to store it in a place that\u2019s easily accessible (such as your mobile device), but you should 4also remember it in case your phone isn\u2019t readily available in an emergency.\n\nEven if you do have your phone handy, you\u2019ll be able to dial the number faster if you know it by heart rather than fumbling through your contacts and wasting precious time. It only takes a minute, and it really is better to be safe than sorry.\n\nProgram the nearest U.S. embassy number while you're at it\n\nAs a back-up to the 911 equivalent, consider saving the nearest U.S. Embassy\u2019s direct and/or emergency line into your contacts. This could be helpful in less urgent emergencies, like a lost passport or an evacuation situation \u2013 each of which could require official assistance.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/10/16/how-dial-911-around-world-store-these-your-phone/3979112002/", "description": "International emergency numbers aren\u2019t something you want to figure out in the heat of the moment.
