In the corporate mid-market, super funds are the new force, ramping up direct lending to businesses via sophisticated fund managers like Metrics Capital Partners and/or their own internal teams, which are disintermediating traditional banks.\n\nIn the banks\u2019 biggest balance-sheet exposure, residential mortgage lending, there has been an explosion of non-banks. Peter Braig\n\nAnd in the banks\u2019 biggest balance-sheet exposure, residential mortgage lending, there has been an explosion of non-banks, which we predicted back in April 2016, on the back of a booming securitisation market. Since the start of 2017, Australian lenders have been able to raise more than $120 billion of funding by securitising, or selling, their home loan portfolios via bonds known as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).\n\nThis is especially impressive given house prices fell by a record margin between 2017 and 2019 and mortgage arrears climbed to the highest levels since the 1991 recession. The tsunami of RMBS issuance has been powered by immense offshore demand for these high-yielding AAA-rated bonds from Asian investors and, more recently, European and North American institutions. Interest in the securities is likely to surge now that the housing market is recovering as a result of the RBA\u2019s efforts to reduce the jobless rate to its full employment target.\n\nWhile the major banks are being regulated out of their skins, non-bank residential lenders suffer from no such restraints. They can run as much leverage as they want and offer home loans to punters on terms that are far more liberal than those the big four have to abide by care of APRA\u2019s extremely strict responsible lending rules.\n\nThis is why many non-banks are pushing \u201cnear prime\u201d products, which encompasses anything that is easier to get approved than a major bank loan, and specialise in offering \u201cnon-conforming\u201d finance with much looser lending standards and loftier default rates.\n\nLike Asian banks have done in corporate lending, non-banks are capturing significant market share gains and will over the next decade emerge as a fifth pillar in the residential mortgage space. And because they are not regulated by APRA on a day-to-day basis, they have an intrinsic competitive advantage over their larger rivals (APRA can regulate non-banks if they present a financial stability threat). The poor old major banks have to contend with ASIC suing them for being too liberal with their lending practices while the RBA and the treasurer both excoriate them (and ASIC) for being too tough!\n\nA final new source of competition is the wave of \u201cneo-banks\u201d APRA has granted licences to, including digital banks like Volt, Xinja and 86400, and the small business specialist, Judo. It has gone from being almost impossible to get a new banking licence in Australia to a straightforward exercise as politicians have pressured the regulator to boost the number of deposit-takers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn late 2015 this column prophesied that as the major banks were being forced to radically reduce their balance-sheet leverage, which we had long advocated, their returns on equity (RoE) would inevitably \u201cconverge with their 11 per cent cost of equity, which will push valuations down from 2 to 3 times book value to 1 to 2 times\u201d. If a bank\u2019s RoE is equal to its cost of equity, it should theoretically trade at book value.\n\nA few months prior, CBA had reported a world-beating full-year statutory (ie, real) RoE of 18.7 per cent and had been trading as high as 3 times book value. Westpac and ANZ were not far behind with RoEs around 16 per cent, and traded at 2.5 times and 2 times book value, respectively. The one (consistent) laggard was NAB, lodging a comparatively miserly RoE of 12.1 per cent, although it still traded at close to 2 times book value in 2015.\n\nThe major banks were the most profitable retail deposit-takers on earth, and their valuations reflected it. But as I explained in a letter to Warren Buffett, this profitability was an artefact of leverage. The majors\u2019 return on assets were actually ordinary and inferior to the best US banks. And once policymakers belatedly acquiesced to our calls for them to substantially delever these behemoths, the RoE mirage disappeared.\n\nFast-forward to the present day and our contrarian projection has played out. On a statutory basis, RoEs have slumped by one-third to the high-single-digit, or low-double-digit, domain. In the 2019 financial year, ANZ and NAB are expected to report statutory RoEs of 9.6 per cent and 9.8 per cent, respectively. CBA\u2019s RoE has dropped from almost 19 per cent in 2014 to 12 per cent today (Westpac sits in the middle at around 11 per cent). Valuations have followed in lock-step with ANZ, NAB and Westpac all trading at circa 1.5 times book value while CBA\u2019s multiple has slumped from 3 times to 2 times book value.\n\nThe silver lining is the much lower leverage and business model risk (as the majors divest offshore exposures and exit non-core activities) comes with a substantial reduction in their risk. This is terrific news for the voiceless and oft-neglected bank stakeholders that supply 95 per cent of their funding, namely depositors and bond holders. And it is not all bad news for the shareholders who provide the remaining 5 per cent of bank funding: if the banks can exploit their enormous scale economies to slash people costs, which account for about 60 per cent of their operating expenses, through automation and transform themselves into higher returning technology businesses, they might one day be able to recover their previous valuation multiples.\n\nThe author is a portfolio manager with Coolabah Capital Investments, which invests in fixed-income securities including those discussed by this column.", "description": "The major banks' return on equity has crashed down towards their cost of equity, which is forcing them to be priced at much closer to book value.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5714%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cef4b0b131c7a3b334fe32f580cc64228a0cf201", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
