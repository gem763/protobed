The 40-year-old Jeselnik describes himself as a comedy \u201cvillain,\u201d but says he hopes to \u201csoften\u201d as he gets older.\n\nGood Talk, which premieres this Friday, September 6th, features interviews with friends like Nick Kroll, Kumail Nanjiani and Tig Notaro. But Jeselnik jokes, \u201cI\u2019d like to get to the point where I\u2019m talking to people that I do not know or care about, that seems fun.\u201d\n\nDuring our conversation, we talked about how Jeselnik\u2019s comedy persona has evolved over the years, how he\u2019s managed to avoid the calls to be \u201ccanceled\u201d that other comics have faced, why he\u2019s \u201cfascinated\u201d by Louis C.K.\u2019s trainwreck attempt at a comeback and a lot more.\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nWhy he doesn\u2019t like the title of his new Comedy Central show\n\n\u201cThe one fight I had with the network on this show was over the title. I really didn\u2019t want to call it Good Talk. I think it\u2019s just a little bit too generic for what I am. But anything that was too me, they thought it would get confused with [his previous show] The Jeselnik Offensive. They thought The Jeselnik Inquisition was too smart, that people wouldn\u2019t know what that was. And then finally, it was getting a little bit heated where I was like, \u2018I want a title, I just want it done so we can move on.\u2019 And they kept saying that the title has to describe what the show is and it might make guests afraid to come on the show if it sounds too hardcore. So someone said, what about Good Talk with Anthony Jeselnik and they were like, OK, we\u2019ll use that. So I\u2019m going to complain about it in almost every episode.\u201d\n\nOn getting fan mail from a white supremacist\n\n\u201cI had a joke about being adopted: \u2018My parents told me I\u2019d been adopted. And I was like, why did you pick me, was I special? And they said, yes, because of all the babies we had to choose from, you were the only one that was white.\u2019 I mean, it\u2019s a joke about adoption. People who have adopted kids love that joke. And then racists are like, \u2018Oh my god,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, you don\u2019t understand, that joke is not for you. But I got a fan letter from a guy who was clearly a white supremacist from Jacksonville, Florida. I remember the name was the most white supremacist name ever. He sounded like he founded a fraternity, one of those weird, old Confederate names. He wanted me to do a gig and I just never wrote back. But it was scary. It was so early in my career that I was like, is this what my fan base is? And what would you do if they actually offered you money at a time when you needed money? I was glad that I wasn\u2019t faced with that decision.\u201d\n\nWhy he believes he\u2019s \u2018uncancelable\u2019\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have things to cancel. Comedy Central\u2019s not going to get upset about a controversial joke no matter what, as long as it\u2019s coming from a decent place, which I think most of my jokes do. I mean, I couldn\u2019t use the \u2018N-word\u2019 and have them back me on it, but I would never do that. It\u2019s strange that you have to scrub your Twitter before you get a major job, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s ever going to affect me in any negative way. Even after a lot of my controversies I hosted Last Comic Standing, which is one of the most mainstream things you can do. So I just think I\u2019m uncancelable.\u201d\n\n\u201c I think it\u2019s funny to watch this guy who was the comedy god for 10 years have to eat all this shit. \u201d\n\nOn Louis C.K.\u2019s attempt at a comeback\n\n\u201cPeople keep asking the question, should he be allowed to perform? And I think that\u2019s the wrong question. This is show business and it\u2019s not fair, just or even remotely reasonable. The question is, should you buy a ticket? And that\u2019s up to the audience member. I\u2019m not sure that Netflix would be completely against putting up his special. I don\u2019t know if I would watch it, but I\u2019ve read every single article about it. I\u2019m just fascinated. It\u2019s like watching somebody fall down. I certainly don\u2019t feel bad for him. I don\u2019t think anything happened to him. I think that he did this. And if he can fight his way back, I\u2019m interested in watching someone drag themselves through barbed wire... Of course he\u2019s allowed to joke about what he wants to joke about. I\u2019d never be like, you can\u2019t joke about Parkland. I\u2019d think he would have a better take on it. I\u2019m a little surprised, to be honest, about where he\u2019s decided to go with this and the tack that he\u2019s taken with his comeback, and who knows what the final result is going to be? But I think it\u2019s funny to watch this guy who was the comedy god for 10 years have to eat all this shit.\u201d\n\nWhy he hopes to \u2018soften\u2019 comedically as he gets older\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get darker as you get older, because it makes you seem bitter. But if you start out dark, you can always soften. And people will still remember what you did and you\u2019re kind of like an old grandpa figure who definitely fought in a war and has done some stuff but now is an old sweet man. But you can\u2019t go the other way. I hope [to soften]. I\u2019d like to. It\u2019s almost like being a punk rocker when you\u2019re younger. I\u2019m 40 now and I want to evolve and change as a person and as an artist. I want to be the type of villain that other villains are afraid of. We live in a world now where there are very real villains. I\u2019m a comedian. People get mad at me, but I make people laugh for a living. There are way worse people out there that you should be upset with. And I like that I might make those people afraid.\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Former SNL cast member and host of Hiking with Kevin, Kevin Nealon.", "description": "On this week\u2019s \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d Anthony Jeselnik opens up about his controversial stand-up persona, watching Louis C.K. attempt a comeback, and his new show \u201cGood Talk.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1595,w_2836,x_125,y_91/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567373306/190902-wilstein-last-laugh-tease_lxanay"}
