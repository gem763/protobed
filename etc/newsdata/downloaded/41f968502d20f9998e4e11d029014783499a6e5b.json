This was seen as the first step in a bid to stop a potentially damaging no-deal Brexit, which was also a major blow for Johnson and his government.\n\nA no-deal departure from the EU worries many Members of Parliament (MPs) on both sides of the \"Remain\" and \"Leave\" camps as it would mean an abrupt, overnight departure from the EU on October 31 with no transition period.", "description": "U.K. lawmakers passed a bill in favor of preventing a no-deal Brexit by a 327-299 vote on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Holly Ellyatt"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105992431-1561672155977gettyimages-1143906994.jpeg?v=1567607747"}
