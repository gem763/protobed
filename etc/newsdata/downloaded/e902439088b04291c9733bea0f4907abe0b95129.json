Mueller\u2019s ambiguity touched off a heated battle in the halls of Congress, fracturing Democrats over whether the caucus should impeach Trump.\n\nThough more than half of Pelosi\u2019s caucus is in favor of pursuing impeachment, including House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, whose committee has begun proceedings, the speaker has remained adamant that the conditions are not yet ripe.\n\n\"I do think that we will have to pass some laws that will have clarity for future presidents,\u201d she said, contending that a \u201cpresident should be indicted, if he's committed a wrongdoing \u2014 any president.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

But so that people will feel 'Okay, well, if he, if he does something wrong, should be able to be indicted.'\"\n\nShe argued that the issue\u2019s absence from the Constitution was not a signal into what its framers felt about charging a president with a crime \u2014 only that they could not have envisioned a president who acted with such reckless abandon for the office and its co-equal branches of government.\n\n\"The founders could never suspect that a president would be so abusive of the Constitution of the United States, that the separation of powers would be irrelevant to him and that he would continue, any president would continue, to withhold facts from the Congress, which part of the constitutional right of inquiry,\" she said.\n\nStill, Pelosi indicated that she hadn\u2019t budged in her opposition to impeaching Trump, maintaining that her colleagues would continue its array of oversight investigations and then follow \"the facts and the law.\" But her opposition has faced fresh brushback and calls for Trump\u2019s removal following reports of a whistleblower complaint from the intelligence community said to revolve around Trump\u2019s making a \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader regarding Ukraine.\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence has refused to turn over the whistleblower complaint to lawmakers, leaving news reports about its contents as the only insight into what it contains, Pelosi called the situation \u201cvery alarming,\u201d even for Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis is in a different class in terms of [Trump's] behavior,\" she said, noting that Trump himself had appointed the inspector general who deemed the complaint \u201curgent\u201d and credible to begin with.\n\nShe also argued that the agency\u2019s whistleblower statute is clear, and that the information must be submitted to the intelligence committees in Congress. \"Right now they are breaking the law\" by not providing that information, she said.\n\nWhile she was on the subject of changing laws that would rein in the president, Pelosi also backed clarifying the limits of acting unilaterally under the guise of national security.\n\nTrump has used national emergency declarations throughout his presidency to make an end run around Congress from everything from imposing tariffs to redirecting already-appropriated funding to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"The president should not be able to interpret the National Security Act as something that gives him free reign to do anything he wants by his personal declaration that something is an emergency,\" she told NPR.\n\n", "description": "\"I do think that we will have to pass some laws that will have clarity for future presidents,\u201d she says.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/cd/49/cb9793774c63a2115cc4810546ca/190920-pelosi-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
