Hands down no amount of bleach that could ever make that okay.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nA third added: \"Dude, I don't care if you put the lid back on it... don't stick something you peed on on a cake! That should not have to be said!\"\n\nThe photo has garnered more than 1,000 \"likes\" and more than 400 comments on a cake-shaming Facebook page.\n\n\"I don't even like bringing food into a bathroom let alone putting a whizz stick on the food...even if they bleached it that is still uncomfortable and not appetising in any way,\" wrote another member of the group.\n\nBut others suggested what appeared to be a pregnancy test could in fact be a very \"realistic\" cake topper.\n\n(Image: Facebook/Well, That's Certainly A Cake Wreck)\n\nOne person wrote: \"Maybe the pregnancy stick is just very realistic fondant? Somehow I doubt that though.\"\n\nAnother pointed out: \"A malformed fondant pregnancy test would be better.\"\n\nOthers took issue another aspect of the cake entirely, arguing that \"we're pregnant\" is dated.\n\nOne person complained: \"I hate that 'we' sh*t. She's pregnant, 'we' are going to have a baby.\"\n\nAnother noted: \"I get irrationally bothered by people saying 'we're' pregnant when referring to a couple in which one person is carrying the child.\"", "description": "The pregnancy test stick, which showed the couple are expecting, would have previously been urinated on", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Facebook Well", "That'S Certainly A Cake Wreck"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20577160.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Cake.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
