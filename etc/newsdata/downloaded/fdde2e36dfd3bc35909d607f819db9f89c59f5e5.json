And what about HW victims? No? Didn\u2019t think so,\u201d McGowan wrote.\n\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter, Farrow writes in his new book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d that Clinton publicist Nick Merrill had contacted Farrow, who was seeking an interview with Clinton as part of work on a foreign policy book. At the time, Farrow was also working on his award-winning New Yorker magazine story about Weinstein.\n\nMerrill told Farrow the \u201cbig story\u201d he was working on was a \u201cconcern for us,\u201d according to The Reporter.

What I do know is simple: I\u2019d already rejected a Weinstein Co proposed doc about the election before talking to Ronan. If HW misrepresented facts, it wouldn\u2019t be the 1st time.\u201d\n\nWeinstein also reportedly contacted NBC and even Farrow\u2019s father, Woody Allen, to try to keep the story from going to print.\n\nWeinstein's trial on rape charges is scheduled for January.", "description": "Rose McGowan called out Hillary Clinton\u00a0last week over a report that Clinton's\u00a0publicist told journalist Ronan Farrow that his investigation into\u00a0Harvey Weinstein's alleged history of sexual misconduct was \"a concern\" for the Clinton camp.", "authors": ["Brie Stimson", "Rose Mcgowan", "Commenting On Hillary Clinton"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/rose-mcgowan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
