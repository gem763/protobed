It\u2019s time to bring our soldiers back home. That\u2019s the way it is,\u201d Trump said at the White House during a news conference with Italian President Sergio Mattarella. \u201cWe\u2019ve had no soldiers injured or hurt. That\u2019s because I\u2019m president. And we\u2019re the boss, just remember that.\u201d\n\nAfter the fall of the Islamic State caliphate in Syria in March, the United States kept military forces in northeast Syria to ensure that the remaining fighters of the terrorist group did not reform. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces was instrumental in the fight against ISIS and worked alongside U.S. forces.\n\nFor months, there have been about 1,000 U.S. troops operating in Syria carrying out the Defeat-ISIS campaign, with 28 soldiers mentioned by Trump on Wednesday stationed at outposts near the Turkish border.\n\nThose 28 soldiers who were withdrawn from northeast Syria ahead of Turkey\u2019s invasion a week ago are now out of harm\u2019s way, Trump said. The soldiers should not be there \u201cas two countries fight over land than has nothing to do with us,\u201d he said earlier in the Oval Office during a meeting with Mattarella.\n\nBut Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said the invasion into Syria is an attack on the Kurds, who are considered terrorists by the Turks.\n\nTurkey, a NATO partner, has raised security concerns about the Syrian Kurdish forces, specifically the YPG forces that make up the SDF, near its border. Turkey associates the YPG forces with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which the United States and Turkey consider a terrorist group.\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s meeting with Mattarella, he also wished \u201ca lot of luck\u201d to Syria and Russia, which also have forces into the region where U.S. troops have withdrawn.\n\nSyria has been engaged in a civil war since 2011. The war has killed more than 400,000 and displaced millions, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York think tank. Russian forces have been assisting Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces fight anti-government rebel groups.\n\n\u201cSo, if Russia wants to get involved with Syria, that's really up to them\u2026It's not our border. We shouldn't be losing lives over it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nYet Trump said the United States is talking with Turkey about their actions in Syria and has put \u201cmassive sanctions\u201d on them to impact their economy.\n\n\u201cSanctions work frankly better than fighting,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Erdogan told reporters Tuesday that Turkey \u201cwill never declare a ceasefire\u201d and he was not worried about U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported. Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Turkey with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet with Erdogan about Syria.\n\nIn a series of tweets Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., criticized Trump\u2019s statements on Turkey\u2019s incursion and abandoning the Syrian Kurds.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that if President Trump continues to make such statements this will be a disaster worse than President [Barack] Obama\u2019s decision to leave Iraq,\u201d Graham wrote. \u201cI fear this is a complete and utter national security disaster in the making and I hope President Trump will adjust his thinking.\u201d\n\nHe also tweeted the statements \u201ccompletely undercut Vice President Pence and Sec. Pompeo\u2019s ability to end the conflict.\u201d\n\nThe House also banded together for an overwhelming 354-60 denunciation of the U.S. troop withdrawal, The Associated Press reported. Many lawmakers expressed worry that it might lead to revival of ISIS as well as Russian presence and influence in the area \u2014 in addition to slaughter of many Kurds.\n\nMattarella also condemned Turkey\u2019s incursion into Syria, saying in just a few days it has \u201calready caused a number of causalities and tens of thousands of refugees and displaced people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an attack which also has another risk, namely that of offering new space which was unthinkable a few days ago to ISIS and to its criminal terrorist activities in Syria, in the Middle East\u2026also in other continents around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump accused the Syrian Kurds of purposely releasing ISIS fighters, thousands of whom have been detained in camps in northeastern Syria, \u201cto make a little bit stronger political impact.\u201d\n\nkenney.caitlin@stripes.com\n\nTwitter: @caitlinmkenney", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019ve been a police force.
