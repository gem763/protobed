Instead, it\u2019s this year\u2019s second worst major currency performer.\n\nFile illustration picture of Norwegian banknotes of different denominations, taken in Trondheim October 31, 2008. REUTERS/SCANPIX Gorm Kallestad\n\nEconomists are for the most part unable to pinpoint domestic reasons for the crown\u2019s weakness \u2014 it has fallen 3% against the euro this year alone \u2014 and some fret the trend is a reflection of worrying signs for the global economy.\n\nAlthough the Norges Bank held rates at 1.5% on Thursday without flagging a further tightening of policy in the near term, it has been an outlier among global central banks in having raised rates three times in the past year.\n\nFor a graphic on G10 + Norwegian crown:\n\nhere\n\nThe crown\u2019s scant gains to a one-week high versus the euro after the policy meeting barely register against its 40% fall since mid-2012. It hit its lowest ever level last Friday at 10.245 EURNOK=D3.\n\nAnd that despite the crown being backed by a much higher interest rate than the main euro zone rate of minus 0.5%.\n\nFor a graphic on The Lonely Hiker:\n\nhere\n\nThe last time the currency of the wealthy Scandinavian oil-exporter was even close to its current level was during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009.\n\nAnd this time too, the root of the weakness may lie in deepening uncertainty about the world economy and investors\u2019 reluctance to hold assets in small, open economies such as Norway\u2019s which are highly exposed to global trade and economic growth.\n\n\u201cAll smaller trade-linked currencies have suffered. Domestic factors have been secondary,\u201d said Erica Dalsto, chief strategist for Norway at SEB, who sees the crown possibly hitting 10.30 by year-end.\n\nShe pointed to weakness in the neighbouring Swedish crown and the increasing correlation since early-2017 between the two currencies.\n\nDalsto said the Norwegian crown\u2019s poor performance suggested there was a lot of uncertainty among international investors spooked by U.S.-China trade ructions, Brexit wrangling and tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe Norges Bank appears to concur, noting in its September policy report that the crown had weakened markedly at the beginning of August when trade tensions between China and the U.S. deepened.\n\nDalsto\u2019s colleague Richard Falkenhall, a senior FX strategist at SEB, suggested the weakness could be down to big investors steering clear because of the risk of a global liquidity seize-up in event of a market crisis.\n\nThat would make the crown and other smaller currencies like it highly vulnerable to a sharp fall.\n\nA MYSTERY\n\nOthers are less sure why the crown is performing so poorly.\n\nAnalysts were expecting that last year\u2019s crown slide, possibly due to the fall in the price of oil, would ease off in 2019. But while crude prices have risen 14% since January, the crown has continued to skid lower.\n\nUBS Asset Management\u2019s head of currency strategy Jonathan Davies described the weakness as a \u201cmystery\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time that Scandinavian currencies have sold off to levels that appear highly undervalued without obvious explanations,\u201d he said.\n\nDavies noted the Norwegian crown was also cheap in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis but said none of the explanations given for the weakness at that time were \u201cwholly convincing\u201d.\n\nNiels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea, agreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a puzzle when you look at the macro-economics because they\u2019re not as terrible as the currency is telling you,\u201d he said.\n\nFor a graphic on Norwegian, Swedish crown increasingly correlated vs. euro:\n\nhere\n\nWORSE THAN SWEDEN?\n\nChristensen said nervousness on international markets may not fully explain the crown\u2019s performance because it is weak even against the currency of Sweden, another country highly correlated to the ebb and flow of global trade.\n\nThe Norwegian crown fell this week to its lowest against the Swedish crown since January NOKSEK=D3.\n\n\u201cIt is a puzzle that it is the NOK that is the weakest of the two \u2013 if anything you find the weak data in Sweden, not Norway,\u201d Christensen said.\n\nBMO Capital Markets\u2019 European head of FX strategy, Stephen Gallo, was the one analyst who attributed the crown\u2019s weakness to Norway\u2019s economic fundamentals, citing a trade deficit, decreased industrial output and an \u201castronomical\u201d run-up in private sector debt.\n\n\u201cThese issues could be enough to cause foreign investors to have second thoughts about buying NOK assets,\u201d Gallo said.\n\nThe central bank, however, does not seem too concerned. It said on Thursday crown weakness may result in higher inflation, which is currently running below its 2% target. What\u2019s more, the weak currency is a boon for the export-driven economy.\n\nAnd foreign ownership of Norwegian shares at 38.9% at the end of September is the highest since 2007, according to data from the Oslo Stock Exchange, which is up more than 10% this year .OBX.\n\n\u201cFor the central bank, as long as it\u2019s not a dramatic fall, it\u2019s a win-win,\u201d Nordea\u2019s Christensen said.\n\n(Corrects paragraph 26 to say inflation running slightly above target of 2.0% (not below 2.5% target)", "description": "Norway's crown should be sailing high, thanks to a central bank that's raising interest rates, a robust economy and a recovery in the price of its main export.
