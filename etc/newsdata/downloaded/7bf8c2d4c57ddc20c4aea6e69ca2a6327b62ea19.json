The news comes one month after president Uli Hoeness threatened to boycott German national team if Manuel Neuer was dropped for Marc-Andre ter Stegen.\n\nLucas Hernandez looks on during France's training session in Clairefontaine on Monday\n\nKarl-Heinz Rummenigge is irritated by France's decision to include Hernandez in their team\n\nHernandez missed Bayern's Champions League game against Tottenham last week and the Bundesliga match against Hoffenheim on Saturday after picking up the knock to his right knee in the side's win at Paderborn two weeks ago.\n\nHe had an operation on the same knee in March to repair ligament damage, an injury he suffered while still an Atletico Madrid player.\n\nBayern said said they had informed the French federation on Saturday that Hernandez could not play in the team's upcoming European qualifiers against Iceland and Turkey, but that they received a reply Monday that the player was expected to return to France nonetheless, in line with FIFA statutes.\n\nHernandez has missed Bayern Munich's last two matches due to a knee injury\n\n'Of the four French players demanded, of course we're making three healthy professionals in Kingsley Coman, Corentin Tolisso and Benjamin Pavard available as per FIFA statutes, but we expected more understanding over Lucas Hernandez due to the risk involved - like the German soccer federation is showing with the injury-induced dropouts of Toni Kroos, Jonas Hector and others,' Rummenigge said.\n\nLast month, Neuer and German goalkeeping rival Marc-Andre ter Stegen have been involved in a petty war of words recently over the No 1 spot, with the latter becoming frustrated with a lack of game time.\n\nHoeness got involved in the debate, threatening to stop players from Germany's biggest club joining up with the national team if Joachim Low decides to replace Neuer with Ter Stegen between the sticks.", "description": "Bayern Munich have criticised the French football federation for requiring injured defender Lucas Hernandez to come to Paris for a doctor's exam during the international break.", "authors": ["Ap Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19409160-0-image-a-24_1570473156167.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
