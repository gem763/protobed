Hmm...", "language": "en", "text": "Fox News host Tucker Carlson said he can\u2019t think of a single company that\u2019s hurt the country more than Twitter, which went down like a lead balloon with some viewers.\n\nCarlson spoke to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) Tuesday on his show \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d about the congressman\u2019s lawsuit against Twitter, which a judge ruled this week may proceed in Virginia. Nunes is taking action against the social media giant due to allegations he was defamed by anonymous Twitter accounts during his 2018 election campaign.\n\nCarlson agreed that the hateful rhetoric on Twitter was damaging, saying that it was \u201chard to think of a company that\u2019s hurt this country more than Twitter.\u201d \u201cMaybe there are some. I can\u2019t think of one,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the hate, and the division and the cruelty that\u2019s now common, it wasn\u2019t common 10 years ago. Twitter\u2019s a huge part of that. It made a small number of people really rich. They should be ashamed of themselves.\u201d\n\nCarlson\u2019s uncharacteristically unifying message prompted discourse on Twitter:\n\nBlaming the messenger? It\u2019s not Twitter, it\u2019s the people who use Twitter. Everyone \u2014 and esp our leaders \u2014 should use Twitter & social media to encourage collaboration, unity and humility, adhering to laws, helping others...\u2764\ufe0f https://t.co/tw6u07eOOM \u2014 julie k. brown (@jkbjournalist) October 9, 2019\n\nI\u2019ve got one in mind.... https://t.co/HC7LvxLozT \u2014 Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) October 9, 2019\n\nit\u2019s not *that* hard tucker https://t.co/WJtNYJdd2j \u2014 kilgore trout will be the hero (@KT_So_It_Goes) October 9, 2019\n\nIf the climate were rich white dudes feelings, we'd have saved it 40 years ago. https://t.co/VWTJlPyHvG \u2014 LOLGOP (@LOLGOP) October 9, 2019\n\nOh, Tucker. Irony just committed suicide. Self-awareness is on life support and introspection is in a coma. https://t.co/hKAeCcTKxo \u2014 Navy Mom \ud83c\udd98 \ud83c\udf0a (@USNavyMomPA) October 9, 2019\n\nFish Does Not Notice Water https://t.co/BuLtwbR0yE \u2014 Sigh Hersh (recalculating) (@Ugarles) October 9, 2019\n\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth, Tucker has long hated Twitter. I remember him telling me he thought it was (I\u2019m paraphrasing) a divisive, addictive waste of time back in like 2012. https://t.co/n9tvfRYqPK \u2014 Liz Mair (@LizMair) October 9, 2019\n\nRetweet if you can think of a media company that\u2019s hurt this country more than Twitter. https://t.co/RFeY2rRdTs \u2014 Jason Sparks (@sparksjls) October 9, 2019\n\nHuh. Weird. For the first time in history, @TuckerCarlson and I agree about something. Maybe Tucker can help make things better by encouraging @realDonaldTrump to lead by example and stop tweeting. https://t.co/o0peTsNAEn \u2014 Eric Davies (@edavies) October 9, 2019\n\nHe's not wrong, guys.\n\n\n\nI mean, I hate the fuckwad but... he's not wrong. https://t.co/jIwyUS4sXB \u2014 Jake Tapper's Liddle' Minecraft Mug (@LaBellDebi) October 9, 2019\n\nI can think of one. https://t.co/V8Jzshmoqc \u2014 Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) October 9, 2019\n\nImagine saying this with a straight face with a Fox News logo on the screen next to you. https://t.co/MLm6XZXSwN \u2014 Justin Kanew (@Kanew) October 9, 2019\n\nView Carlson\u2019s segment on Fox News below:", "description": "The Fox News host's beliefs about the \"hate\" and \"division\" on the platform were received as just a bit ironic.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9d599a200000d5054fccfe.jpeg?cache=8s4a58swzy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
