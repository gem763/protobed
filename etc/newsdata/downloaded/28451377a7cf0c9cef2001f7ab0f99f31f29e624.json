Boris Johnson, who was then running in the Tory leadership contest prior to becoming prime minister, was criticised at the time for not showing enough support for Sir Kim.\n\nMeanwhile, one of Britain's top police officers - who expressed concern at the leaks - has been made a dame.\n\nImage copyright Reuters/AFP/PA\n\nCressida Dick, whose police career started at the age of 23 after a brief spell working in a fish-and-chip shop, is one of just a few non-political figures on Mrs May's list.\n\nMrs May, who once compared her determination to delivering Brexit with the fighting spirit in Geoffrey Boycott's batting marathons, has awarded the former Test opener with a knighthood.\n\nTelling journalists he was one of her sporting heroes, she said in November 2018: \"Geoffrey Boycott stuck to it and he got the runs in the end.\"\n\nBut the knighthood for Boycott, who is honoured along with former England cricket captain Strauss, has been criticised by domestic abuse charities.\n\nThe 78-year-old was convicted in France in 1998 of beating his then-girlfriend Margaret Moore in a French Riviera hotel.\n\nMrs May, who introduced a landmark Domestic Abuse Bill to Parliament earlier this year, was accused of sending a \"dangerous message\".\n\nAdina Claire, co-acting chief executive of Women's Aid, said: \"Celebrating a man who was convicted for assaulting his partner sends a dangerous message - that domestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime.\"\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mrs May hosted a champagne reception for the England cricket team after their World Cup win in July\n\nSir Simon Woolley, the founder of operation Black Vote, and Ruth Hunt, the ex-chief executive of Stonewall, have been made crossbench life peers, while BEMs have been awarded to Graham Howarth and Debra Wheatley - Mrs May's head chef at Chequers and housekeeper at Downing Street respectively.\n\nThe list of peerages - which means those appointed get to sit in the House of Lords - include several nominated by other parties to sit on their benches.\n\n'Policy of restraint'\n\nAmong them are former NUT general secretary Christine Blower, for Labour, and former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who will become the party's second peer in the House of Lords.\n\nThe Lord Speaker, Lord Fowler, said Mrs May's list was \"substantially smaller\" than those drawn up by predecessors, helping to reduce the size of the House of Lords. \"I hope that the current prime minister continues this policy of restraint,\" he added.\n\nSeveral MPs have received honours:\n\nSir Patrick McLoughlin, Conservative MP for Derbyshire Dales (Companion of Honour)\n\nGeorge Hollingbery, Conservative MP for Meon Valley (Knighthood)\n\nDavid Lidington, Conservative MP for Aylesbury (Knighthood)\n\nCharles Walker, Conservative MP for Broxbourne (Knighthood)\n\nBrandon Lewis, Conservative MP for Great Yarmouth (CBE)\n\nJulian Smith, Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripon (CBE)\n\nSeema Kennedy, Conservative MP for South Ribble (OBE)\n\nJohn Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw and an independent government adviser on anti-Semitism, received a non-affiliated peerage.

The former South Down MP made history in 2010 when she became the first leader of a nationalist party to wear a remembrance poppy.\n\nCriticising Mrs May's choices, Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: \"It comes as no surprise that big Tory donors and Number 10 cronies are being honoured yet again.\n\n\"The Tories only care about looking after their own and will only stand up for the wealthy few who fund them.\"", "description": "Theresa May's closest advisers from her time at No 10 receive honours, as does the Met Police chief.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/148C2/production/_108726148_fa24e971-f1b8-4514-9235-3337afe34bc3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
