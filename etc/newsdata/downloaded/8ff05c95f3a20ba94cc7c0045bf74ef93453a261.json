Late last year rumours began to circulate about my appearance at that event, many of which are simply untrue. While my intention was to honour a musical hero, I recognise my appearance was offensive and I made a terrible mistake.\n\n(Image: Geoff Robinson / SplashNews.com)\n\n\"As a consequence of this, I readily agreed to disciplinary actions by my employer last year. Since then however, allegations surrounding the party have continued to be made against me. Moreover, they have been used against a wonderful company and the label I love. I have therefore come to the conclusion that I should make this statement and step down, with immediate effect.\n\n\"I am devastated that this mistake has caused upset and has called into question my commitment to diversity, equality and inclusion, values which I have championed throughout my career. I have learned a great deal from this event and will resolutely continue to champion these values moving forward.\n\n\"It has been an incredible privilege to have worked with the immensely talented artists, managers and team at Atlantic and the wider Warner family.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"I unreservedly apologise to anyone who has been hurt.\"\n\nCook has also worked with Jess Glynne and Anne-Marie during his time at Atlantic.\n\nA statement from Warner Music, Atlantic's parent company, said: \"Ben Cook is leaving Atlantic UK and this will be his last week in the office\".\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
