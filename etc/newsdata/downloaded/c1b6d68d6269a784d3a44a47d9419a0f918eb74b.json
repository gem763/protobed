It has since been updated to include the most relevant information available.]\n\nIndex funds are responsible for saving investors like you and me untold billions of dollars in fees over the past couple of decades. They\u2019ve also spared us countless headaches. (I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to pick specific stocks to buy to get exposure to utilities or play the growth in India\u2019s middle class.) And the best index funds \u2026 well, they\u2019ve made us a lot of money, which is the point of it all.\n\nBut index funds are also contributing to an issue that could blow up in our faces.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe push into index funds has intensified to the point that some experts believe it\u2019s not only driving the market higher, but it\u2019s causing a valuation bubble. In short, if you buy into any fund (index or not), the fund must invest that money into more stocks \u2014 and all that buying is distorting valuations. The danger, then, is that when that bubble pops, many supposedly safe index funds will feel the pain worse than other parts of the market.\n\nThe lesson here is that the best index funds to buy for the foreseeable future aren\u2019t all going to look the same.\n\nSome top index fund picks will be so buy-and-hold-oriented that you won\u2019t need to worry about the bubble popping in a year or two or three because you plan on holding for 20 years, maybe 30. Some of the best picks for next year will only be worth buying into for tactical trades of a week or two at a time.\n\nSo the following is a list of the best index funds for everyone \u2014 from long-term retirement-minded investors to click-happy day traders. And this includes a few funds that I either hold currently or have traded in the past.\n\nIn no particular order \u2026\n\n\n\n\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV)\n\nType: Large-Cap Equity\n\nExpenses:\n\n0.04%, or $4 annually for every $10,000 invested.\n\nEvery year, I take a look at the best index funds for investors, and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) is always at the top of my list.\n\nThe argument is typically the same, and consists of two parts:\n\nThe S&P 500 Index is one of the best chances you have at solid investment performance. That\u2019s because most equity funds fail to beat the market, most hedge funds fail to beat the market, and, to quote Innovative Advisory Group, \u201cindividual investors as a group have no idea what they are doing.\u201d So if beating the market is so darned hard, just invest \u201cin the market\u201d and get the market\u2019s actual return. The VOO and two other exchange-traded funds allow you to do that.\n\nis one of the best chances you have at solid investment performance. That\u2019s because most equity funds fail to beat the market, most hedge funds fail to beat the market, and, to quote Innovative Advisory Group, \u201cindividual investors as a group have no idea what they are doing.\u201d So if beating the market is so darned hard, just invest \u201cin the market\u201d and get the market\u2019s actual return. The VOO and two other exchange-traded funds allow you to do that. The VOO is the cheapest way to invest in the S&P 500.\n\nBut that second point has changed.\n\nIn trying to position itself for advisers who may want to suggest the lowest-cost offerings, iShares parent BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) lowered the fees on 15 of its Core-branded ETFs, including the S&P 500-tracking iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV).\n\nPreviously, the IVV charged seven basis points. It\u2019s better than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF\u2019s (NYSEARCA:SPY) 0.09%, but still above VOO\u2019s 0.03%. Now, though, IVV falls closest to the cellar at just 0.04% in annual fees. Thus, the recommendation stands. Buy the market for as cheap as you can, and right now, that\u2019s the IVV.\n\nAnd that note of caution? If the valuation bubble does pop, the S&P 500 and its components very well could be hit harder than many other blue-chip stocks outside the index. If you only have a few years left in your investment horizon, you should acknowledge this and invest (and monitor) accordingly. If your investment horizon is measured in decades, buy and never look back.\n\nLearn more about iShares\u2019 IVV here\n\n\n\n\n\niShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH)\n\nType: Mid-Cap Equity\n\nExpenses: 0.07%\n\n\n\nAs I just said, it\u2019s difficult to beat the market. But the iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (NYSEARCA:IJH) is awfully, awfully darn good at it. From a total performance perspective, the IJH has beaten the IVV over a 15-year period.", "description": "[Editor's note: \"The 10 Best Index Funds to Buy and Hold\" was previously published in August 2019.
