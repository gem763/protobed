Her overarching theory of what\u2019s wrong in the country is that the power of the big guys\u2014lobbyists, Wall Street, corporations, and the government in cahoots with them\u2014keeps the system from working for the little guy.\n\nTo emphasize her point, she re-released her plan, embodied in proposed legislation, to stop corruption where it thrives, among the ruling class exchanging money for influence. For drama, she spoke in the shadow of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, where 146 people, mostly young female immigrants, burned to death in 1911. That\u2019s what happens, she said, \u201cwhen the rich and the powerful take control of government and use it to increase their own profits while they stick it to working people.\u201d\n\nFor a show of power, she was introduced by Maurice Mitchell, the president of the influential Working Families Party, whose coveted endorsement she snatched from Bernie Sanders that very day. The group claims progressive wins in dozens of races across the country, and its backing may be a sign to the Bernie bros that it\u2019s safe to come over should he drop out.\n\nWorking Families Party Endorses Elizabeth Warren After Backing Bernie Sanders in 2016\n\nHer Washington Square Park performance explains why she\u2019s attracting crowds growing toward Elton John size. She\u2019s a Poli Sci prof\u2019s dream of how a campaign should be built and organized. Everyone assumed she gave off fumes of the Harvard faculty lounge but instead she exudes Oklahoma, where she grew up poor and gradually worked her way into the middle class. She\u2019s cheerful despite the no-nonsense demeanor of a former nun who\u2019s given up one habit for another.\n\nWearing black pants, a camisole, and a flowing cardigan every day gives her back the extra time campaigning while female usually requires. She routinely delivers a big helping of spinach to a crowd standing still for 40 minutes, unlightened by jokes unless you count her self-aware smile when she repeats, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d The crowd Monday night, estimated between 8,000 and 20,000, stuck around for four hours to take selfies with the candidate after she spoke.\n\nWarren extolled her idol Frances Perkins, who took up her fight for labor rights after the sweatshop fire and became FDR\u2019s labor secretary, the first female Cabinet member in U.S. history. \u201cWhat did one woman\u2014one very persistent woman\u2014backed up by millions of people across this country get done? Big structural change,\u201d Warren said.\n\n\u201cSocial Security. Unemployment insurance. Abolition of child labor. Minimum wage. The right to join a union. Even the very existence of the weekend.\u201d By the end of that, I was thinking of Warren: \u201cYes, she can.\u201d\n\nYet there\u2019s a big undertow of \u201cNo, she can\u2019t.\u201d Some otherwise liberal Democratic men, threatened by her certainty, her style, her coming after their perch with her reforms, are against her. She reminds some of them of their first wives, who knew more than they did, or Mother Superior, who wouldn\u2019t read their short stories until they diagrammed sentences. Women, the most worried about beating Donald Trump, hear men say they\u2019re not voting for a lefty who can\u2019t win, and retreat to a safer choice.\n\nDemocrats Say They\u2019ll Support a Woman for President. Here\u2019s How We Know They\u2019re Lying.\n\nThus, the feedback loop: Joe Biden is electable because he tops the polls. He tops the polls because he\u2019s electable. Warren is not electable, allegedly, even as she keeps rising in the polls.\n\nElectability is this year\u2019s euphemism for likability, the \u201cwho you would like to have a beer with\u201d question supposedly discarded after it was asked and answered to the detriment of Hillary Clinton and the entry of Trump into our lives. The hope this time was that with so many women running, voters wouldn\u2019t have their 2016 excuse for not voting for a woman in the Oval Office: \u201cI\u2019m for a woman, just not this one.\u201d There were five, now three. They couldn\u2019t all be \u201cthis one.\u201d\n\nWarren is leading the female pack and, like Hillary, is bedeviled by some ineffable characteristic she lacks, or has, something some Democrats just can\u2019t put their finger on except they know it when they see it and they won\u2019t vote for it. That translates, Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says, to a capable male candidate who\u2019s not likable being electable\u2014Ted Cruz, anyone?\u2014but not a still more capable woman.", "description": "Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastEverything Elizabeth Warren is about came together in Manhattan on Monday night when she brought her anti-corruption campaign to the capital of capitalism.
