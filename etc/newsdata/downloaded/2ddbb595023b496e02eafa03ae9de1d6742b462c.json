I think we all are, and I\u2019m not sure how we get out of it.\n\n\u201cWe are so cynical about politics, and that show is the opposite of cynicism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows the difficulties that you go through, but showed people who really believe in the mission of government and understand that politics is the way you create your moral vision.\n\n\u201cit\u2019s a very dark, weird time now. I don\u2019t know how it would play,\u201d he added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
