I counted seven bodies in body bags.\n\n\"Some bodies were pulled out from under the rubble. Some bodies were burned.\u201d\n\nIn the White House, a triumphant Mr Trump said Baghdadi had been a \u201cviolent and vicious\u201d man responsible for executing Christians in Libya and Egypt, and the mass murder of Yazidis.\n\nBaghdadi came to prominence in 2014 when IS had captured swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria. Mr Trump said: \u201cHe will never again harm another innocent man, woman or child.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nUS forces had spent two hours in the compound and DNA tests gave \u201ccertain identification\u201d, he said.\n\nMr Trump watched the operation live in the White House situation room, where his predecessor Barack Obama saw US forces killing al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 2011.\n\nSecurity experts now fear reprisals for the Baghdadi killing.\n\nRichard Kemp, former head of international terrorism intelligence at the Cabinet Office, said: \u201cWhen bin Laden was killed, al-Baghdadi unleashed violent retaliation. Security services will now be braced for attempts to avenge his death.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi planned to hand over the leadership of IS to Abdullah Qardash.\n\nQardash is known as a brutal but intelligent leader, and is nicknamed \u201cThe Destroyer\u201d or \u201cThe Professor\u201d.\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab last night cautioned: \u201cThe death of Baghdadi is a significant milestone in the coalition\u2019s work to defeat Daesh , but it is not the end of the threat.\u201d\n\nThe brother of David Haines, the Brit executed by IS in 2014, said Baghdadi\u2019s \u201cpoisonous ideology\u201d lives on.\n\nMike Haines said: \u201cWe must continue to work together to identify and stamp out the threat.\u201d", "description": "While the success of Operation Kayla Mueller is lauded, experts say security services will now be braced for attempts to avenge his death", "authors": ["Adam Aspinall", "Image", "Getty", "Instagram", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20175150.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
