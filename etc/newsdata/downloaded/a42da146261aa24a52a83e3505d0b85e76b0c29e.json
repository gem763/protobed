Meanwhile, mining difficulty also adjusted to a new record of nearly 12 trillion.\n\nNotably, both figures have jumped 60 percent since June 14, the data shows.\n\nRelated: Bitcoin Miners Halt Operations as Rainstorm Triggers Mudslides in China\n\nBitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty \u2013 a measure of how hard it is to create a block of transactions \u2013 adjusts after 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks. This is to ensure the time to produce a block remains around 10 minutes, even as the amount of hashing power, deployed by machines around the globe competing to win freshly minted bitcoins, fluctuates.\n\nSeveral new models of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners hit the market over the summer, with an average hashing power around 55 tera hashes per second (TH/s).\n\nAssuming all of the 35 EH/s of new hashing power added since mid-June came from these top-of-the-line models, a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that more than half a million such machines have connected to the bitcoin network. (1 EH/s =1 million TH/s)\n\nBillion-dollar business?\n\nThese powerful ASIC miners, made by major manufacturers such as Bitmain, Canaan, InnoSilicon and MicroBT, are priced from $1,500 to $2,500 each. So if more than half a million of them were delivered, as estimated above, the leading miner makers could have made $1 billion in revenue over the past three months.\n\nRelated: Congressional Research Service Finds Potential Blockchain Uses for Energy Sector\n\nBitcoin\u2019s spiking hash rate and difficulty are in line with the soaring price since earlier this year, which led to increasing demand for mining equipment that has significantly outstripped supply. It\u2019s also in part thanks to the rainy summer season in southwestern China which resulted in cheap, abundant hydroelectric power.\n\nFurther, there has also been a growing interest in Russia\u2019s Eastern Siberia region, where the Brastsk hydropower station built in the Cold War era has been utilized to power mining farms that are estimated to account for almost 10 percent of the total computing power on the bitcoin network.\n\nMiners in China estimated earlier this year that bitcoin\u2019s average hash rate in the summer would break the level of 70 EH/s, which happened in August.\n\nAs such, major miner manufacturers have already sold out equipment that is due for shipment until the end of the year with customers placing pre-orders three months in advance.\n\nTokenInsight, a startup that focuses on analysis of crypto trading and mining activities, said in a report published Friday that additional supplies of miners are expected to hit the market in the coming months.\n\n\u201cFollowing the drastic increase in bitcoin\u2019s price, the bitcoin mining market saw significant inflation in Q2 2019. Most of the miners from various manufacturers were in serious shortage and pre-orders submitted in Q2 and Q3 are to be delivered by the end of the year,\u201d the report states.\n\nTherefore, the firm estimates mining difficulty will maintain its growth momentum to reach 15 trillion by the end of the year \u2013 with bitcoin\u2019s average total hashing power crossing the threshold of 100 EH/s for the first time in its history.\n\nBitcoin mining facility image courtesy of Bcause\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "The computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin has hit yet another new high, suggesting that as many as\u00a0600,000 machines have come online since June.", "authors": ["Wolfie Zhao"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/nY2rd_xniZcgTGlWMZyk0A--~B/aD03Njk7dz0xMDAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/3d071f47cbf04cf566be71a6cae4c47a", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
