The 80-mph limit suggested by the Greens would have effectively closed down one of the last roads where drivers can freely select their preferred speed. The autobahn is a defining factor in the perception of Germany abroad, but the topic is highly contested and politically charged at home. \u2026The vote was 126 for a speed limit, 498 against, with seven abstentions.\n\nThe vote basically reflected a right-left split, though the Social Democrats tried to have their cake and eat it too.\n\n\u2026Green Party big shot Cem \u00d6zdemir claimed that roads would be safer with a speed limit, and he asked for German\u2019s \u201cspecial way\u201d to be ended. \u2026The post-communist Left Party volunteered that \u201celectric mobility\u201d should mean more \u201ctrains and trams,\u201d while the Social Democrats, who are in a ruling coalition with the Christian Democrats, argued that they would support a speed limit were it not for their obligations to the coalition. The centrist CDU, the center-liberal FDP, and the conservative AfD all argued against a speed limit.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the autobahn is actually quite safe.\n\nThe autobahn road system, situated in one of the most traveled places on earth, is extremely safe. Accident rates have fallen dramatically over the past few decades, and many of the remaining deaths can be attributed to factors other than speed. Today, the fatality rate is one of the lowest in the world. Those opposed to a speed limit argue that this could be due to the fact that due to the differences in velocity, drivers are alert, generally stay to the right when not passing, and tend to stay aware of their surroundings.\n\nHaving driven many times in Europe, I can state with confidence that they are better (and more polite) drivers.\n\nSlow cars don\u2019t loiter in the left lane on highways, and that\u2019s true in France and Italy as well as Germany.\n\nI\u2019ll close with some good news.\n\n\u2026speed limits have gradually eased all over the globe. Austria\u2019s limit has been provisionally raised to 87 mph on select stretches; Abu Dhabi allows 100 mph on sections of the road system, and many U.S. states are raising limits as well.\n\nI\u2019m old enough to remember the horror of a nationwide 55-mph speed limit (one of the many awful policies adopted during the Nixon years).\n\nThe limit was increased in 1987 and then \u2013 in a rare moment of federalism \u2013 the nationwide speed limit was repealed in the mid-1990s (among the many good policies of the Reagan and Clinton years).\n\nLet\u2019s hope Germany holds firm so they don\u2019t ever have to worry about repealing bad policy.\n\nP.S. The article also noted that, \u201cIt has been reported that in the summer of 1995, Germany chancellor Angela Merkel, then minister for environmental affairs, broke out in tears over Helmut Kohl\u2019s refusal to mandate a speed limit on the autobahn.\u201d Given Merkel\u2019s statism, I\u2019m not surprised.\n\nP.P.S. Enviro-zealots want onerous speed limits because of their quasi-religious opposition to energy consumption. Politicians, by contrast, view speed limits as a tool for generating tax revenue (which is why I\u2019ve applauded civil disobedience in Washington, DC, and Arizona).", "description": "Every so often, I share quirky examples of libertarian policy .10/22/2019 16:39:38PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
