They understand how to attract attention: Their protests feature meme-able signs to capture interest across social media. Their events \u2014 from global strikes to sit-ins in the House speaker\u2019s hallway \u2014 are tailored to garner media coverage. They also know how to spot enemies looking to divert attention and to ignore or dismiss them.\n\nSimply put, they don\u2019t seem to care what adults, skeptics, deniers and crusty politicians think of them. And they waste very little of their time, energy and focus work-shopping their message or bulletproofing it against criticism. They simply pay their enemies no attention. They\u2019re participating in the culture wars while also managing to float above the fray.\n\nNone in the movement embody this like Ms. Thunberg, who suffers no fools in her unsparing and blunt statements to diplomats and members of Congress alike. Some of this may be the result of age, what Robinson Meyer at The Atlantic describes as the \u201cunique moral position of being a teenager,\u201d in which \u201cshe can see the world through an \u2018adult\u2019 moral lens\u201d but \u201cunlike an actual adult, she bears almost no conscious blame for this dismal state.\u201d\n\nShe does not allow her message \u2014 that the youth of the world have been betrayed by past generations\u2019 inaction on climate change \u2014 to be co-opted by fawning lawmakers, and she dismisses their praise for her as a tragic role reversal that forces her to be the adult in a room of well-dressed children. And she seems keenly aware that her rivals\u2019 critiques are merely efforts to divert her attention. \u201cIt seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus, since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis,\u201d she wrote of her \u201chaters\u201d on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\nThe usual tactics of the right-wing media break down in the face of this type of resolve. While outrage campaigns intended to work the refs and appeal to fears of appearing partisan may work with lawmakers or companies in Silicon Valley, the youth climate movement appears wholly unmoved. While the levers for climate progress proposed by solutions like a Green New Deal are undoubtedly political, the broader movement\u2019s desire \u2014 an inhabitable earth for all \u2014 is far from partisan. The stakes, as the movement sees it, are too high to focus attention on the trolls. And the pressure, from conservative pundits and Breitbart contributors, doesn\u2019t just get dismissed, it goes unnoticed.", "description": "Young people like Greta Thunberg are participating in the culture wars while also managing to float above the fray.", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/opinion/27warzelprint/25warzelWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
