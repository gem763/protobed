In January, the trio filed against Bauman, and alleged that the abuse was \u201cwell-known and apparently tolerated\u201d by other officials. The plaintiffs accused Bauman of unwanted touching and sexually explicit comments.\n\n\u201cOur party is at its best when it lives up to our values. One of those values is treating people fairly,\u201d current party chair Rusty Hicks told the Times in a statement. \u201cWe have reached an equitable settlement that begins the process of getting back to the work 9 million California Democrats expect from us.\u201d\n\nSeveral other cases brought against Bauman by former party staffers remain active or pending. Bauman first took a leave of absence and then resigned last November following claims of misconduct toward staff members and activists. He said that he planned to seek treatment for alcohol abuse in a statement apologizing for his actions.\n\n\u201cI deeply regret if my behavior has caused pain to any of the outstanding individuals with whom I\u2019ve had the privilege to work. I appreciate the courage it took for these individuals to come forward to tell their stories,\u201d Bauman said at the time. \u201cLeading the California Democratic Party to historic victories has been the honor of a lifetime, and I look forward to continuing this important work upon the conclusion of the investigation and when my health allows.\u201d\n\nMore settlements could could severely hamper Democratic campaign funding during a cycle in which the party has seven vulnerable House seats to defend. California Democrats reported nearly $12 million in total funding in their latest campaign finance filings.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Former chairman Eric Bauman cost the California Democratic Party more than $800,000 in a discrimination and sexual misconduct settlements, according to records reviewed by the Los Angeles Times.State and federal campaign finance filings show $378,348 in legal settlements for three lawsuits, filed by", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/coWhJA_fxUoS7bBm4BXNkg--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/c7e5ffa6b689fc0e8d351724f0ee3324", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
