He\u2019s lucky. Because if Sanders lived under \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d things likely would not have gone as well.\n\nSanders, along with every other Democrat pushing \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and its variants, constantly bleats about how the U.S. spends far more on health care but gets worse results than countries such as Canada or the U.K. But the quality measures \u2013 infant mortality and longevity \u2013 are notoriously unreliable for international comparisons.\n\nInfant mortality rates depend on how countries measure them, and longevity has more to do with things like obesity, crime, and drug abuse than health care.\n\nWhat Sanders and company never do is look at how countries handle actual health care delivery. That\u2019s because when you do that, socialized medicine starts to look more like Hell than Nirvana.\n\nCanada and the U.K. are plagued with chronic shortages of doctors and nurses, shortages of hospital beds, shortages of the latest diagnostic tools.\n\nThe result is treatment delays and outright denials. This grim reality plays out daily in the newspapers of the two countries, stories that Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other single-payer advocates pretend don\u2019t exist.\n\nThis is as true for heart patients as anyone else.\n\nA 1995 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that no patients needing an urgent coronary angiography test \u2013 used to reveal artery blockages \u2013 received one within 24 hours in Canada or the U.K., whereas 65% did in the U.S. Nearly two-thirds of Canadians and 94% of Brits had to wait more than three days.\n\nThe same study found that while 80% of urgent coronary bypass operations occurred within 24 hours in the U.S., only 24% did in Canada and 10% in the U.K.\n\nThe situation has not improved in either country since then.\n\nA dozen cardiac patients died in Quebec in just the first four months of this year while waiting for surgery. Why the delay? According to the head of the province\u2019s cardiac surgeons association, it\u2019s largely because \u201cof a shortage of operating room nurses and perfusionists \u2014 the technicians who operate the heart-lung machine during the surgery\u201d as well as a lack of hospital beds.\n\nOverall wait times for specialist care of any kind has more than doubled in Canada since the 1990s, according to the Fraser Institute, which has been tracking this.\n\nThe British regularly see headlines such as \u201cHeath patients die on waiting lists,\u201d and \u201cPatients are dying waiting for heart surgery.\u201d In Wales, 152 patients died waiting for heart surgery in two hospitals over five years. Last year, the NHS reported that wait times for bypass surgery doubled in Wales to 79 days.\n\nA 2013 analysis found that the death rate for patients with congestive heart failure was three times higher in British hospitals than those in the U.S.\n\nHeart patients are hardly the only ones forced to wait for treatments in those countries. In the U.K., shortages of doctors and nurses often force cancer patients to wait so long that their survival rates are now lower than comparable countries, and far below survival rates in the U.S.\n\nTens of thousands of Canadians come across the border each year and pay out of pocket for health care they can\u2019t get in a timely fashion from their country\u2019s version of \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\nWe could go on, and on, and on. The point is that these problems would inevitably emerge here if Sanders, Warren and company were allowed to impose \u201cMedicare for All\u201d on the country. Socialism always leads to shortages and low quality.\n\nWe\u2019re glad that Sanders got the care he needed in a timely fashion and hope for a speedy recovery. We just wish he\u2019d embrace the (mostly) private health care system that provided him such excellent care, instead of trying to destroy it with \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Written by John Merline\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
