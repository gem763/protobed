No reconstruction is expected to start before 2021.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Not scaremongering\u2019 \u2013\n\nIt is impossible at this stage to say \u201chow much this is going to cost, how long this is going to last,\u201d said Michel Aupetit, the archbishop of Paris.\n\nMacron\u2019s five-year goal would see the cathedral\u2019s reconstruction completed in the spring of 2024, before Paris hosts the Olympic Games that year.\n\nThe top priority is to eliminate any risk to the vaulted ceiling, with the main danger coming from 500 tonnes of scaffolding that was erected around the fire for renovation work before the blaze.\n\nThe damage caused by just a single bar of scaffolding falling could prove irreparable, and the work to remove the structure will take several months.\n\n\u201cThis is not scare-mongering. It is a physical reality,\u201d said Christophe-Charles Rousselot, director general of the Fondation Notre-Dame, the charity that is overseeing the gathering of donations to the cathedral.\n\nWith regards to the spire, a late addition to the mediaeval cathedral designed by the 19th-century French architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, many see it as an integral part of the building.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be rebuilt as it was before,\u201d said Philippe Villeneuve, the architect in charge of restoring the cathedral, arguing that the sheer power of the spire integrated it with the mediaeval church.\n\nHis is backed by Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s descendants and, according to opinion polls, the French public.\n\nBut the government has left open the possibility of an international competition for architects to design something new.\n\n\u2013 \u2018I feel orphaned\u2019 \u2013\n\nExperts are also intensively researching the precise original architecture of the cathedral, so that when reconstruction begins it is as accurate as possible.\n\n\u201cBefore 2010, we only have old-style surveys, plans that have been redrawn on numerous occasions which are very partial and very imprecise,\u201d said Remi Fromont, one of the architects responsible for the site who is working on drawing up accurate plans.\n\nAndrew Tallon, a Belgium-born scholar who died aged 49 in November 2018, carried out hugely valuable laser scans of the interior in 2010 that have proved an even more valuable legacy than he could have imagined.\n\n\u201cWe know that we will have shortcomings. Not all the chapels were systematically scanned. There are still areas of doubt,\u201d Fromont said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, private individuals and above all rich French cooperations rushed to pledge hundreds of millions for the rebuilding of the cathedral.\n\nThere were concerns whether this funding would ever be realised.\n\nBut France\u2019s richest man Bernard Arnault in September signed a formal accord over his pledge of 200 million euros ($220 million), as did the Pinault family for their promised 100 million euros.\n\nA signing on another 100 million promised by the oil giant Total is awaited in October.\n\nThe consortium of fundraising groups behind the drive believes that 800 million euros ($890,000) can be raised in total, with over 616 million euros now either transferred or pledged.\n\nBut lovers of the historic masterpiece, be they tourists, architecture buffs or worshippers, may have to wait some time before Notre-Dame becomes theirs again.\n\n\u201cI have felt myself orphaned, it is like being in mourning,\u201d said Michele Chevalier, 70, a regular at Notre-Dame who was at the service when the first evacuation took place.\n\n\u201cI still manage to pray, but it\u2019s not the same.\u201d", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 One day after the blaze that scarred Notre-Dame, President Emmanuel Macron addressed a nation in shock at the damage to one of its", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/09/cdc613_workers-installed-fencing-notre-dame-cathedral-in-as-began-lead-clean-up-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
