Stand with Hong Kong,\" bringing a sharp rebuke from China, where several businesses and TV networks cut ties with the Rockets and blocked their games from Chinese viewers.\n\nThe NBA moved to contain the fallout, faced with the prospect of a serious setback to its work in China's lucrative market. Morey deleted the tweet and expressed his regrets. The NBA also issued a statement Sunday apologizing for the tweet, and both Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and All-Star power forward James Harden distanced themselves from Morey.\n\nCommissioner Adam Silver's handling of the matter threatens to damage the reputation of the NBA, which has been seen as one of the more progressive sports leagues in the U.S.\n\nAs the league scrambled to save face in China, lawmakers at home from both parties ripped the NBA, accusing it of putting profit over principle.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz Rafael (Ted) Edward CruzNBA draws bipartisan backlash over China response GOP turns furor on media amid impeachment fight Cruz, Graham send well wishes to Sanders after heart procedure MORE (R-Texas), who is often spotted at Rockets games, tweeted Sunday that he was \u201cproud\u201d to see Morey stand up for Hong Kong and accused the NBA of \u201cshamefully retreating\u201d in \u201cpursuit of big $$.\u201d\n\nAcross the aisle, two 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke (D-Texas) and former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro (D), also blasted the league.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who lost a Senate challenge to Cruz, tweeted that \u201cthe only thing the NBA should be apologizing for is their blatant prioritization of profits over human rights. What an embarrassment.\u201d And Castro said the U.S. should \u201cnot allow American citizens to be bullied by an authoritarian government.\u201d\n\nFor the NBA, the controversy has high financial stakes. The league has spent decades expanding its footprint in China. In July, the league and Chinese telecom giant Tencent struck a five-year, $1.5 billion deal to create an exclusive broadcasting partnership as the country\u2019s interest in the NBA soars.\n\nThe Rockets played a trailblazing role in those efforts after drafting Chinese basketball star Yao Ming with the first pick in the league\u2019s 2002 draft. Yao\u2019s nine-year career with the Rockets earned him a place in the NBA Hall of Fame while endearing the Rockets to China\u2019s exploding fan base.\n\nBut China's lucrative market is also a challenge for U.S. corporations that take pains to avoid any political controversies over issues such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet that could damage their bottom lines.\n\nThe negative reaction in China to Morey's tweet was quick. The Chinese Basketball Association, now chaired by Yao, said it would suspend \u201cexchanges and cooperation\u201d with the Rockets, who are now blacklisted by China\u2019s sports and media entities.\n\nThe NBA issued a statement in English on Sunday, saying it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cdeeply offended\u201d legions of Chinese fans.\n\nCritics saw the statement as an effort to distance the league and team from Morey, a successful and innovate general manager.\n\nHarden, one of the Rockets' star players, also offered an apology.\n\n\"We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there,\" Harden said at a press conference before a game in Kyoto, according to ESPN.\n\nThe league further stoked controversy with a Mandarin-language translation of its statement that condemned Morey's tweet as \u201cinappropriate\u201d and used other stronger terms. In the Chinese statement, the NBA apologized for the \u201churt feelings\u201d caused by Morey\u2019s tweet, borrowing a phrase commonly used by the Chinese government to rebuke challenges to Beijing\u2019s edicts, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe NBA is not the first major U.S. business to yield to Chinese pressure, but the apology for Morey was seen a surprising break for a league that has long supported politically outspoken players and coaches.\n\nSilver, who took over the NBA in 2014, publicly backed players who sported Black Lives Matter shirts in pregame warmups, formed partnerships with the movement and has spoken out on other domestic political issues.\n\nThe NBA moved its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte, N.C., to New Orleans after North Carolina enacted a controversial law banning transgender individuals from using bathrooms other than those for their assigned biological sex.\n\n\u201cI thought the @NBA was proud to be the \u2018wokest professional sports league\u2019?\u201d tweeted Sen.

But he insisted that Morey was being \"supported in terms of his ability to exercise his freedom of expression.\"\n\n\"I accept that it is also Chinese governments' and Chinese businesses' right to react to those words and, at least from my long-time experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues,\" he added.\n\nBut those remarks are unlikely to stem the firestorm of criticism in Washington, where lawmakers are putting their own pressure on the NBA.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), said Monday that he requested a meeting with Silver to discuss \u201cthe importance of supporting the brave individuals fighting to free themselves from the grip of Communist China.\u201d\n\nSen.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Silver had another press conference scheduled for Tuesday morning. The controversy also threatens to expand as other team executives and players are asked to weigh in.\n\nAnd it is unclear if the league's actions will be enough for China or the U.S. where lawmakers are pushing the NBA to walk back its apology.\n\nRep.
