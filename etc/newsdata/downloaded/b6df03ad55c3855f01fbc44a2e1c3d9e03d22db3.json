He contradicted himself moments later, saying the company did not want to get involved in verifying the truth of political claims.\n\n\u201cSomebody fact checks on ads? You contract with someone to do that. Is that right?\u201d Waters asked Zuckerberg. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied.\n\nLater, during an exchange with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, Zuckerberg explained that his company will not remove political ads from candidates \u2014 even if false \u2014 because he believes voters deserve unfiltered access to the words of politicians. He said exceptions would be made for political ads that encouraged violence or seek to suppress voting.\n\nFacebook on Thursday sought to set the record straight, noting that while will not fact check political ads from candidates, it does evaluate the accuracy of political ads from political advocacy groups or political action committees.\n\n\u201cIn a democracy, people should decide what is credible, not tech companies,\u201d the company wrote in a statement emailed to the Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s why \u2014 like other internet platforms and broadcasters \u2014 we don\u2019t fact check ads from politicians.\u201d\n\nFacebook\u2019s policy is similar to those at other internet platforms, reflecting the reluctance of big tech companies to police political content on their platforms.\n\n\u201cGiven the sensitivity around political ads, we have considered whether we should ban them altogether,\u201d Facebook said in its statement to The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cBut political ads are important for local candidates, up-and-coming challengers, and advocacy groups that use our platform to reach voters and their communities.\u201d\n\nCNN chief Jeff Zucker called Facebook\u2019s policy not to monitor political ads for truth-telling \u201cludicrous\u201d Thursday. He noted that his network recently rejected two ads that President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign sought to air, saying they repeated allegations against former Vice President Joe Biden that had been proven false.\n\nFacebook ran a similar ad.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s comments on Facebook\u2019s hands-off policy also failed to satisfy Waters, who said Wednesday it would give \u201canyone Facebook labels a politician a platform to lie, mislead and misinform the American people, which will also allow Facebook to sell more ads. The impact of this will be a massive voter suppression effort.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts created an intentionally false Facebook ad claiming that Zuckerberg had endorsed President Donald Trump for re-election. Warren did so to highlight her critique of Facebook\u2019s political-ad policies.\n\nDuring his exchange with Ocasio-Cortez, Zuckerberg also made misleading comments about the company\u2019s reliance on third-party fact checkers to evaluate false news stories posted to the site.\n\nOcasio-Cortez asked Zuckerberg why Facebook had made the conservative publication The Daily Caller one of its third-party fact checkers.\n\nIn actuality, the fact checking company is Check Your Fact, a subsidiary of The Daily Caller. The Daily Caller was founded by Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson, who has been criticized for declaring white supremacy a \u201choax.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe actually don\u2019t appoint the independent fact-checkers,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a response. \u201cThey go through an independent organization ... that has a rigorous standard for who they allow to serve as a fact-checker.\u201d\n\nNot so, said Baybars Orsek, who directs that organization, the International Fact-Checking Network at the St. Petersburg, Florida-based Poynter Institute.\n\n\u201cIt is a misrepresentation of the program,\u201d he said, explaining that his network works to certify fact-checking organizations, including Check Your Fact.\n\nFacebook requires its fact checkers to be network certified but has the final say on which fact checkers it works with.\n\n\u201cThey make their decisions based on their priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not appoint fact checkers to work with Facebook.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press is a participant in Facebook\u2019s initiative to fact-check and identify misinformation being shared widely online on Facebook\u2019s platform.", "description": "Facebook reiterated its policy of not removing misleading or bogus political ads Thursday, clarifying its own policies after CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered...", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT997_zucker_ZG_20191024185807.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
