Simon Cowell is pictured above with Nicole Scherzinger\n\nMiss Rawcliffe is also not as close to Cowell as her predecessor, Siobhan Greene, who helped the mogul set up his Syco entertainment empire, which makes The X Factor, in 2003. She left ITV last month to set up her own production company,\n\nA source told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018Katie\u2019s brief is to find new formats and new shows. She\u2019s very bright and wants to modernise the entertainment on ITV\u2019s schedule.\n\n\u2018She is breaking up the old guard and looking forward to making her mark. Simon used to hold all the cards when it came to his deals, but now it isn\u2019t such a one-way street.\u2019\n\nMiss Rawcliffe, who previously worked for the broadcaster\u2019s programme-making arm ITV Studios, takes her new job as X Factor: Celebrity tanks in the ratings.\n\nFeaturing the likes of journalist Martin Bashir and ex-footballer Vinnie Jones, last Saturday\u2019s episode recorded its lowest ever audience of 3.9 million.
