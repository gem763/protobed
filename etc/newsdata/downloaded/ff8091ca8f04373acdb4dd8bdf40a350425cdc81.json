REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nUp the road, bartender Jeanne Bonner made just $2 in tips one day last week, compared with $80 during a normal shift.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve thrived off GM for years,\u201d Bonner said. \u201cWhen they are not working it hurts everybody around here.\u201d\n\nConvenience store owner Brad Khirfan says he has lost two-thirds of his business since GM workers walked off the job last month, triggering the longest nationwide U.S. auto strike in nearly 30 years.\n\nKhirfan, who has run his shop next to the GM truck plant for 32 years, said the strike could have political repercussions.\n\n\u201cI take the pulse of the workers here. A lot of them feel abandoned by (U.S. President Donald) Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cHe promised manufacturing jobs would come back, and it\u2019s not happened.\u201d\n\nThe United Auto Workers union strike is spreading pain throughout Michigan, a battleground for the November 2020 election where the economy was slowing before more than 23,000 UAW workers walked out of GM\u2019s Michigan plants in mid-September. The total number of UAW strikers nationwide is 48,000.\n\nUnemployment in the state is 4.2%, and it has been rising even as the national rate continues to fall. The state\u2019s job growth has slowed dramatically, said Chris Douglas, an economist at the University of Michigan-Flint. The strike has cost a total of $228 million in lost wages in the state between Sept. 16 and Oct. 6, according to the East Lansing, Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group.\n\nThe health of Michigan\u2019s economy matters to rivals in the 2020 U.S. presidential race.\n\nTrump, a Republican, carried Michigan by less than 11,000 votes in 2016, an unexpected victory that along with wins in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin propelled his ascent to the White House. Trump\u2019s tough stance on trade and his promises to win back manufacturing jobs resonated with many UAW members.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s Democratic rivals have tried to use the GM strike to win back UAW votes. They have joined GM strikers on picket lines and echoed their calls for GM to share profit more fairly and invest more in U.S. plants.\n\nA HISTORY OF CONFLICT\n\nFlint, a city of about 100,000 people located 70 miles (113 km) northwest of Detroit, has a long history of labor conflict. In 1936, workers at a GM factory here staged a sit-down strike that forced the automaker to recognize the United Auto Workers union, a milestone in U.S. labor relations.\n\nSome workers picketing outside GM\u2019s Flint truck this week remembered the UAW\u2019s 1998 strike against GM parts-making plants in Flint that lasted 54 days and cost the company $2 billion. In the years following that bitter clash, GM sold or closed several of its Flint operations, shedding thousands of UAW jobs and battering the city\u2019s economy.\n\nToday, Flint is one of the most impoverished cities in America. Nearly 40% of the city\u2019s residents live below the poverty line, according to U.S. Census data published in 2018. Flint suffered a prolonged water crisis that began in 2014, when it emerged that lead had leeched into its water supply, exposing many residents to elevated lead levels.\n\nThe sprawling GM truck assembly plant offered hope for better times. The new heavy-duty pickup trucks assembled at the plant are highly profitable, and GM President Mark Reuss earlier this year traveled to Flint to say the plant would hire 1,000 additional workers to build them.\n\nThe strike halted production just as the truck plant was ramping up to deliver vehicles to dealers.\n\nDOUGHNUTS AND $250 A WEEK\n\nInstead of earning overtime pay, GM truck plant workers are getting by on $250 a week in UAW strike pay.\n\nOn the picket line, strikers acknowledged the frequent horn blasts from passing drivers honking in solidarity. One truck driver arrived with free doughnuts for the strikers, while another group set up an impromptu hot dog stand.\n\nRuss Van Buren, 47, a striking worker outside the Flint plant, describes himself as a political independent. He has not decided whom he will vote for next year, but said if the Michigan economy turns worse, Trump will be in trouble.\n\nSlideshow (11 Images)\n\n\u201cIf our economy goes down the toilet, people will desert Trump,\u201d Van Buren said. A third of UAW workers backed Trump in 2016, the union has said. \u201cPeople are going to look for another person to run this country,\u201d Van Buren said.\n\nStanding nearby, Jeremy Henman, 32, a striking forklift driver, said he likes Trump\u2019s idea of a border wall and his support of gun owners, and thinks the economy is doing great.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled with what he\u2019s done,\u201d Henman said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely voting for him again.\u201d", "description": "Waving a placard on the picket line outside a General Motors Co truck plant in Flint, Michigan, Robert Bacon says he has no money to spend.
