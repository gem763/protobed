GABRIEL, La. (AP) - Rapper Kevin Gates has been banned from all Louisiana prisons after a photo showed him visiting a facility with over $2,000.\n\nNews outlets report a photo of Gates at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center sparked an investigation that led to the ban and disciplinary actions against two corrections officers.\n\nA July department report says Deputy Warden Perry Stagg and Maj. Jason Linzy violated rules during Gates\u2018 visit. It says Gates bypassed body scanners, didn\u2019t sign in and claimed to be visiting his father, although there isn\u2019t record of any relatives at the facility.\n\nDepartment spokesman Ken Pastorick says Stagg was demoted and reassigned while Linzy received a letter of counseling.\n\nInvestigators recommended Gates face contraband charges but there was no evidence as the money wasn\u2019t seized.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rapper Kevin Gates has been banned from all Louisiana prisons after a photo showed him visiting a facility with over $2,000.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": ""}
