Located 50km from Rio Branco, the capital city of Acre, a state within the Amazon rainforest, it was constructed in 2015 and provided a focus for agroecological knowledge, traditional medicine cultivation and cultural ceremonies for the community. But on the afternoon of August 22, Huw\u00e3 Karu Yuxibu was burned along with trees, the well, and the medicinal and food gardens of the Huni Kuin people.\n\nMany of the Huni Kuin people who live near the centre have been previously displaced from the Brazilian-Bolivian border where they lost territory to competing land interests on the Amazonian frontier.\n\nAcross Brazil, there was an 84% increase in fires between 2018 and 2019, the greatest number of registered fires in seven years. Over half of these have been in the Amazon according to Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research. In the state of Acre, there have been a staggering 2,498 separate outbreaks, an increase of 176% from the previous year.\n\nThe Huni Kuin community are well known to us, and articulated their ongoing struggle for territorial autonomy at the launch of our major research project in February. In April, they made clear to researchers and students at the Federal University of Acre of their determination to preserve their cultural identity and practices, underpinned by the Huw\u00e3 Karu Yuxibu.\n\nThe cacique (chief), Mapu Huni Kuin, told us the community has called on the government to investigate the cause of the fire, and invited a research visit in the coming weeks. The images they shared on social media of the scorched trees, gardens, medicinal plants, and the centre are symbolic of the social and cultural conflict that lies at the heart of the Amazon fires.\n\nCentro Huw\u00e3 Karu Yuxibu via Facebook More\n\nLegacy of marginalisation\n\nThe Amazon is a complex ecosystem. For centuries it has been home to indigenous communities, African descendants, riverbank and fishing communities, rubber tappers and peasant agriculturalists who depend on the cycles of the trees, soils and rains for their individual and collective livelihoods.\n\nThe presence of many of these distinct communities within the forest bears the hallmarks of colonial incursions by Europeans, as their violence and diseases decimated the original dwellers of the Amazon. Then the rubber boom of the mid-19th century and cattle ranching led to further expulsion of indigenous people, like the Huni Kuin, from territories that they are yet to recover. The legacy of this is still felt keenly in the marginalisation of so many of the Amazon\u2019s residents today.\n\nThe 21st-century commodity boom that underpins so much of the world\u2019s green economy has put new pressures on the Amazonian frontier. It has led to a revival of massive scale sugar cane plantations in Brazil for bio-ethanol export with enthusiastic international backing, the construction of huge dams for hydroelectric power, the dedication of land equivalent to the area of Germany to soya, new palm oil plantations, and the westward expansion of cattle pasture for meat production.\n\nRead more: Blood in bio-ethanol: how indigenous peoples' lives are being destroyed by global agribusiness in Brazil\n\nAlongside this trajectory is the increasing number of illegal land invasions by timber merchants, cattle ranchers and the armed merchants that accompany them. The culture and practices of indigenous people has put them at odds with the logic and strategy of large farmers, agribusiness and their representatives in government. Land-related conflicts increased 36% between 2017 and 2018 in Brazil with 960,630 people the victims of land-related disputes.", "description": "Huw\u00e3 Karu Yuxibu, the cultural centre of the Huni Kuin indigenous group in the Amazonian state of Acre, was destroyed by fire in August.", "authors": ["Brian Garvey", "Lecturer Work", "Employment", "Organisation", "University Of Strathclyde", "Jose Alves", "Professor", "Department Of Geography", "Federal University Of Acre", "Maria De Jesus Morais"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QJ53znMv37koDrI4t0hXMA--~B/aD0yNzg7dz00OTY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_conversation_464/110575102e66b83f7f5c4cea7724edd0"}
