It is better to do one where I can feel strong and make sure I\u2019m up there among the best in the world.\u201d\n\nWhile Farah is at pains to point out his marathon career is still very much a work in progress, he acknowledged his success last year has seen him emerge as one of the genuine contenders heading towards Tokyo.\n\nFarah claimed his first marathon title 12 months ago when he stormed clear of Ethiopia\u2019s Mosinet Geremew to win in a time of two hours, five minutes and 11 seconds \u2013 a European best by 37 seconds.\n\nFarah added: \u201cI think it is going to be a different race in Chicago this year because after winning it last year I am going into it with a target on my back.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still learning, but I like to have that pressure. Pressure is always something you put on yourself, but for me it gives me the confidence of knowing I\u2019ve done it once, so I can do it again.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime Farah is favourite to become the first athlete to win six Great North Run titles on Sunday, which would see him surpass Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who has won five in the women\u2019s wheelchair race.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis is a really important race for me before Chicago because it gives me the opportunity to assess my performance and get back to basics.\n\n\u201cA lot has changed since I won my first Great North Run in 2014. I have been getting stronger every year and I have every intention of crossing that bridge leading the pack once again.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Sir Mo Farah will target a sixth successive Great North Run title on Sunday with \u201cno regrets\u201d over his decision to skip the upcoming World Athletics Championships in Qatar.
