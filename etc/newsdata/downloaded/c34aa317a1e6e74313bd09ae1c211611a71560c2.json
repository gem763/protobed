However, the truth about her crimes could be set to out in the coming episodes as \u2014 at Goldie\u2019s (Chelsee Healey) request \u2014 she speaks to a psychiatrist.\n\nAfter Sylver (David Tag) and Goldie became worried about Breda\u2019s state of mind, the pair began to investigate what their mum was getting up to \u2014 and Goldie became convinced that Breda had been sleeping out in the pig farm. After Goldie confronted her with this, Breda was forced to lie so that the truth could remain hidden. As a result, she promised Goldie that she\u2019d sell the farm.\n\nHowever, in the coming episodes, Joel (Rory Douglas-Speed) suggests that Goldie should call the estate agent for an update on the farm. The young woman does exactly that, but she\u2019s left perturbed when she realises that the farm was never put on the market in the first place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterwards, Goldie confronts Breda with this new information, but the villainous granny claims that the estate agent is lying \u2014 but she\u2019s not convinced by her mum\u2019s explanation, and thus books her an appointment with a psychiatrist.\n\nLater, Breda opens up to Tony (Nick Pickard) about her troubles, and the imprisoned man suggests that she might be better off attending the appointment her daughter\u2019s arranged for her.\n\nAs a result, she turns up at the hospital \u2014 for no other purpose but to humour everyone. However, it\u2019s pretty clear that she\u2019s incredibly hostile, and in a moment of anger, she reveals too much to the psychiatrist \u2014 who\u2019s left incredibly concerned by what she\u2019s said. As a result, Breda storms out.\n\nAfterwards, Breda packs a bag with food, but \u2014 before she can leave \u2014 she\u2019s stopped in her tracks by Sylver, Goldie and Jack (Jimmy McKenna).\n\nIs the truth finally out?\n\nWill the reason for Breda\u2019s odd behaviour finally come to light?\n\nOne to watch: Tuesday 22nd October at 7pm on E4.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will the truth finally out?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/HO-EP-5284-BREDA-AND-TONY-03-68d8_1571125839.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
