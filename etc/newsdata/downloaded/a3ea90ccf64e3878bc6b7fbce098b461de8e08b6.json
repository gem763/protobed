But instead of seeking a rematch with Allred in his old Dallas-based district, Sessions has set his sights on Flores\u2019s district, which stretches from Waco in the north to the Austin suburbs in the south.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cMy goal is to work together to restore the Republican majority in the House and maintain our control of the Senate and White House,\u201d Sessions said in a statement announcing his candidacy. \u201cMy support for President Trump Donald John TrumpSessions says he still supports Trump despite ouster as AG House Republicans voice concerns about White House's impeachment messaging Giuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info: report MORE is unwavering and I will dedicate my time in office to help enact his conservative agenda.\u201d\n\nHe is expected to formally kick off his campaign later Thursday at McLennan County Republican headquarters in Waco.\n\nFlores, who has represented the 17th District since 2011, announced last month that he would not seek reelection. He cast doubt on Session\u2019s candidacy on Thursday, saying that his successor should be someone with a record in the 17th District.\n\n\u201cOur voters strongly prefer choosing from our talented pool of existing leaders in our local communities,\u201d Flores said in a text message. \u201cOur next Congressman/Congresswoman will be someone who is currently living, working, raising families, and serving in TX17.\u201d\n\nSessions isn\u2019t a stranger to the 17th District. He was born in Waco and grew up there. But asked whether Sessions was now living in the 17th District, Flores responded, \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019s 17th District is safer territory for Republicans than the 32nd District. President Trump won the district by more than 17 points in 2016 and the race isn\u2019t considered particularly competitive for Democrats.\n\n--Scott Wong contributed.", "description": "Former Rep.
