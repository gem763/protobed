Kraus said Dean may face charges.\n\n'That's murder': Fort Worth police officer shoots woman inside her home Read more\n\nJefferson, 28, was playing video games with her eight-year-old nephew in the early hours of Saturday morning, her family\u2019s lawyer said, when she was killed by the officer who was outside the property, had not parked in front of the house, did not identify himself and appears to have given her no time to respond to his initial command before shooting through a window.\n\n\u201cThere is simply no justification for his actions,\u201d Ashley Carr, Jefferson\u2019s oldest sister, said at a press conference on Monday morning. \u201cShe was enjoying her life in her home, where no one would have expected her life to be in harm\u2019s way, especially not in the hands of a civil servant who had taken the oath to serve and protect.\n\n\u201cWe demand justice for Atatiana through an independent, thorough and transparent process.\u201d\n\nThe officer, who was initially placed on administrative leave, was scheduled to be interviewed by the Fort Worth police department\u2019s major case unit on Monday. He had worked for the department for about 18 months and his record was clean except for a traffic accident.\n\nKraus said that Dean was not cooperating with the investigation.\n\n\u201cHad the officer not resigned I would have fired him,\u201d he said at a press conference, citing violations of departmental policies on use of force, de-escalation and unprofessional conduct.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry for what occurred,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cNobody looked at that video and said there\u2019s any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately.\u201d He said he is trying to train officers to \u201cact and react with a servant\u2019s heart instead of a warrior\u2019s heart\u201d.\n\nKraus said that a criminal investigation into the shooting is ongoing and a \u201csubstantial update\u201d is expected no later than Tuesday. He also said the department has \u201cpresented a preliminary case to the FBI to review the officer\u2019s actions for possible civil rights violations\u201d.\n\nFort Worth\u2019s mayor, Betsy Price, said the city will appoint a \u201cthird-party panel of national experts\u201d to review the department.\n\n\u201cThis man murdered someone,\u201d said Adarius Carr, Jefferson\u2019s brother. \u201cHe should be arrested.\u201d\n\nThe officer is white. Jefferson was black. Lee Merritt, an attorney for the family, suggested that the response to a call to a non-emergency line at 2.23am on Saturday from a concerned neighbour who noticed the doors were open was escalated because the house is in a predominantly African American area of the Texas city.\n\n\u201cThis was a wellness call,\u201d Merritt told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond me to begin to understand what kind of police force responds to a wellness call with the equivalent of Swat. There were several officers prowling around the property \u2026 as if they were conducting some clandestine abstraction.\u201d\n\nKraus said that non-emergency and 911 calls go through the same dispatcher.\n\nMerritt said the doors were open so a cool breeze would enter the house while Atatiana, who was known as \u201cTay\u201d, played video games with her eight-year-old nephew, Zion, who was present when she was shot and will receive counselling.\n\n\u201cI ask myself, what would have happened if that little boy went to the window instead of his auntie?\u201d Merritt asked. \u201cHe saw her when she fell.\u201d\n\nJefferson was a biology graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and reportedly worked in pharmaceutical equipment sales. Family members said she had decided to move into the property in order to look after her ailing mother.\n\nMerritt said a spate of fatal shootings by police in Fort Worth this year \u2013 officers have killed six people since the start of June, Kraus said \u2013 showed federal law enforcement should take over the investigation into the shooting, as well as conduct a review of what he described as systemic problems with the department.\n\n\u201cWhy this man is not in handcuffs right now is a source of continued agitation from this family and this community,\u201d Merritt said.\n\nJefferson died at the scene.\n\nBody camera footage released by police shows an officer with a flashlight walk around the house. He appears to catch sight of someone inside, yells, \u201cPut your hands up, show me your hands,\u201d then fires a shot through a window less than a second later.\n\n\u201cShe was a smart, ambitious, kind person with a nurturing spirit,\u201d Ashley Carr said.\n\nAnother sister, Amber Carr, said Jefferson had planned to take her sister\u2019s children to the State Fair of Texas last weekend and would help Zion get ready for school.\n\n\u201cHe was the one who told me what happened,\u201d she said.\n\nJefferson was killed less than two weeks after Amber Guyger, a white former officer in nearby Dallas, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of Botham Jean, a black man who was eating ice cream in his apartment when she burst in and shot him.", "description": "Atatiana Jefferson, 28, was killed by a white police officer outside her property while she was playing video games with her nephew", "authors": ["Tom Dart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/625f5924656173fe8c02cdc64f9e044411a15b66/0_1693_4000_2398/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=74b5a20925e3ef33c057ef7defde1004", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
