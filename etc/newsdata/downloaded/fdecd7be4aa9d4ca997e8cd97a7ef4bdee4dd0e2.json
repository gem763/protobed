The Canadian is 2-0 lifetime against the 21-year-old Tsitsipas, winning earlier this year at Indian Wells, Calif., (hard court) and London/Queen's Club (grass court).\n\nDenis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., will face top-ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia in the second round on Wednesday.\n\nHe took Djokovic to four sets in the third round of the Australian Open, but only won four games in the second round at the Rome Masters.\n\n\"He's beaten me twice so there's not much for me to lose, so I'll just go out there and enjoy myself,\" Shapovalov said. \"I'll go out there and give it all I have. It's going to be a tough one, but I have a great game and I think I have a chance to beat him.\"", "description": "Canadians improved to 4-0 at the Shanghai Masters after wins by Felix Auger-Aliassime and Vasek Pospisil on Tuesday.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5313092.1570542780!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/auger-aliassime-felix0100819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
