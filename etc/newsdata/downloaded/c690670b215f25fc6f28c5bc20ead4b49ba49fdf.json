It has faced broad condemnation for the president\u2019s decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris climate accord.\n\nTwenty-four American states launched a lawsuit against the Trump administration in September over its bid to restrict their authority to limit auto emissions.\n\nThat move came days after the White House issued a new rule reversing a requirement for all new light bulbs to be energy-efficient by 2020, triggering an outcry among activists.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Climate change will not be on the agenda of next year\u2019s G7 summit, to be held at US President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/ee7eb9_acting-white-house-chief-staff-mick-mulvaney-told-reporters-climate-change-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
