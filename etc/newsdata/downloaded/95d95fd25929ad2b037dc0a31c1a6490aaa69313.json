The biggest damage would be to the British themselves,\" Scholz told the Funke media group.\n\n\"But we should be under no illusion - it would affect Germany too. New tariffs and additional tariff controls could lead to delays in trade,\" he said.\n\nHe added, however, that German customs authorities were well-prepared for such an eventuality.\n\nIn 2018, German exports to Britain accounted for roughly 6% of overall foreign sales, making the United Kingdom the fifth-most important export destination for German goods makers.\n\nGermany's export-dependent manufacturers are already suffering from uncertainty over Brexit, a global economic slowdown and rising trade tensions, and most economists expect Europe's biggest economy to dip into recession.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a divorce deal could still be reached between Britain and the EU.", "description": "German Finance Minister warns no-deal Brexit would disrupt trade", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8H23O_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
