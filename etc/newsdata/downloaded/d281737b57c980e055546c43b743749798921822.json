Ralph Northam (D) on Friday declared a drought watch for all of Virginia as low rainfall and record-breaking high temperatures are anticipated to produce a \u201csignificant drought event.\u201d\n\nNorthan said in a statement that water suppliers, self-supplied water users and all Virginians should begin preparations for a potential drought as over half the state experiences a water deficit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWhile water conservation activities during a drought watch are generally voluntary, we encourage localities and individuals across Virginia to heed this warning and take necessary steps to monitor their water usage,\u201d said Northam.\n\nA drought warning is the next step after a drought watch. Government officials said that should one be issued, water conservation and contingency plans that are already in place or are prepared during a drought watch would take effect.\n\n\u201cHigher temperatures and less consistent precipitation patterns driven by climate change are making extreme weather like droughts more prevalent around the world, and Virginia is no exception,\u201d said Secretary of Natural Resources Matthew Strickler. \u201cGovernor Northam and our administration are taking steps to monitor and mitigate drought impacts and address the causes and symptoms of climate change.\u201d\n\nThe drought has already impacted pastures where cattle and other livestock feed, with the latest Department of Agriculture crop report showing that 71 percent of those fields in Virginia are in poor or very poor shape, according to The Associated Press.", "description": "Gov.
