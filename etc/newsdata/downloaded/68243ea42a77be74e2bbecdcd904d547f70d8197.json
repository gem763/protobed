Morse Performing Arts Center\n\nOcala, Florida\n\n1:47 P.M. EDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. Special place. Really special place. But where I\u2019m disappointed: I said, \u201cWe could have had 25,000 people if we did it outside.\u201d They said \u2014 (applause). Did you see all the people outside? They all want your seat. That\u2019s the way life goes. (Applause.) And you\u2019re not giving it up. I know you too well. You\u2019re not going to give it up. Please sit down. Let\u2019s enjoy it. Let\u2019s enjoy ourselves.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you, President Trump!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No, you got tremendous crowds out there \u2014 thank you. I love your leg. Look at that, he has my name tattooed on his leg. (Applause.) How did you get to The Villages? How do you get to The Villages? Huh? That\u2019s great.\n\nBut I\u2019m thrilled to be here in one of the most famous and thriving communities anywhere in Florida, and really anywhere in the world, as far as I\u2019m concerned \u2014 The Villages. (Applause.)\n\nIn fact, I was thinking about moving to The Villages, but I just couldn\u2019t leave Mar-a-Lago. I couldn\u2019t leave it. (Laughter.) I got stuck at Mar-a-Lago. I don\u2019t know.\n\nBut this has been a great area for us, and it\u2019s been a great part of our victory. I don\u2019t know if we got 100 percent, Ron, but it was pretty close, right? Anybody in there didn\u2019t vote for us, right? No, we love it. And we met the folks that built The Villages and that run The Villages, and they\u2019re out here someplace. And they\u2019ve done a fantastic job. Where are they? Where \u2014 they\u2019re here some place. Stand up, please. (Applause.) What a job you\u2019ve done. Great job. Great job. And that was started with your grandfather and your father and you folks. And what a great job you\u2019ve done.\n\nYou know, in my old days, I would have been jealous. Now I couldn\u2019t care less about them. (Laughter.) It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s amazing how being President can do that to you. (Laughter.)\n\nSo in my campaign for President, I made you a sacred pledge that I would strengthen, protect, and defend Medicare for all of our senior citizens. And you see it\u2019s under siege, but it\u2019s not going to happen. (Applause.)\n\nToday, I will sign a very historic executive order that does exactly that: We are making your Medicare even better, and we are not letting anyone \u2014 it will never be taken away from you. We\u2019re not letting anyone get close. (Applause.)\n\nYou see these people on the other side? These people are crazy, by the way. They\u2019re totally crazy. (Laughter and applause.) But they want to take it away and give you lousy healthcare. It\u2019s pretty incredible. You want to keep your doctors, right? Remember, with Obama \u2014 President Obama, right? He said, \u201cYou can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.\u201d That didn\u2019t work out too well for the people.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: We\u2019re trying to forget.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Twenty-eight times. He said he\u2019s trying to forget. (Laughter.) You better never forget, okay? Never forget.\n\nAs long as I\u2019m President, no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do today. (Applause.)\n\nThis order is the latest step in my administration\u2019s drive to ensure the world\u2019s best healthcare for all Americans. Together, we\u2019re creating a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, makes healthcare more affordable, gives you more choice and control, and delivers the high-quality care Americans deserve. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing \u2014 we\u2019re strengthening our healthcare system to a level that nobody thought would be possible.\n\nOur economy is booming. We\u2019re doing fantastically well. I think it gets a little bit hurt by politics. (Applause.) But our country is so strong and our economy is so powerful that even politics, and even when you have the \u2014 the \u201cDo-Nothings\u201d \u2014 I call them the \u2014 really, the \u201cDo-Nothing Dems.\u201d They can\u2019t even affect it very much. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019ve created over 6 million new jobs since the election. The unemployment rate has reached a 51-year low. Two point \u2014 think of that. Think of that. (Applause.) Then, soon, it\u2019s going to be a historic number, like so many of the other numbers.\n\n2.5 million people have been lifted out of poverty. That means more Americans that now have \u2014 and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about \u2014 they have a great way of life. They have affordable healthcare options and millions of seniors are enjoying better, healthier, and more prosperous retirements. I should be retiring with you. (Applause.) I should be in this audience, clapping. But I didn\u2019t trust anybody to be standing here, because I know what you have. (Applause.)\n\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. It\u2019s true. I didn\u2019t trust anybody. It\u2019s very important.\n\nAnd nobody has done more in two and a half years \u2014 their first two and a half years \u2014 than what we\u2019ve done. Whether it\u2019s Right to Try, whether it\u2019s tax cuts \u2014 no matter what it is, nobody has done we\u2019ve done. Not even close.\n\nWe\u2019re delighted to be joined today by a man who is really, really good at \u2014 he ran one of the largest drug companies, and really successfully, and I took him out. Look, that\u2019s where, you know, like \u2014 that\u2019s where the money is. Well, that\u2019s where the knowledge is.\n\nHe ran one of the biggest, most successful companies. I said, \u201cAlex Azar, come on out. I want to get you to be the top person in charge of this.\u201d I said, \u201cSo, let me ask you, how much bigger is this than the company you\u2019re in?\u201d It\u2019s like hundreds of times bigger. It\u2019s a monster. It\u2019s a monster. And what a job. Alex Azar, you know who he is. Where is Alex? (Applause.) Wherever you are. Alex, thank you.\n\nAnd he works with Administrator Seema Verma, who has been so incredible. Seema, you have to stand up. What a job. (Applause.)\n\nThey know the most intricate little quarter sentences. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. I\u2019d say, \u201cWhat about this?\u201d And they\u2019d tell me, \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s always like a little roadblock, but we figure our way around.\u201d\n\nAnd somebody else who is going to be lowering your drug prices with us in a very, very short distance. We\u2019re going to buying them from a slightly different source. A little bit unconventional. A lot of people say I\u2019m unconventional; sometimes you have to be unconventional. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, Alex, when are we are going to let Governor Ron DeSantis and your incredible First Lady Casey DeSantis \u2014 when are they going to be \u2014 when are they going to be able to do what we want to do? (Applause.) Alex, when are they going to be able to do what we have to do? \u201cSoon.\u201d Alex says, \u201cSoon.\u201d Because they\u2019re going to have a big fat, beautiful surprise for you. And that has been an incredible couple and a great governor, and the job they\u2019re doing is phenomenal. And I was honored to be very much involved in that campaign. (Applause.)\n\nAnd if he was doing a lousy job, I\u2019d probably just wouldn\u2019t have shown up today. (Laughter.) But he\u2019s doing one of the best jobs in the whole country. Ron DeSantis. (Applause.)\n\nAnd also helping Ron and Casey: Jeanette N\u00fa\u00f1ez, your Lieutenant Governor. Jeanette, thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, Jeanette. Great job.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody. (Applause.) Ashley, I saw you down there. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nAnd a few warriors we have with us. You know, Ron was one of our warriors. He was in Congress and he was fighting the Russian hoax. That was the Russian witch hunt hoax. And he was so impressive that when he said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019d like to run for governor,\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019d rather keep you right where you are because they\u2019ll come up with another crazy idea.\u201d But I\u2019m glad I did it. And it worked out well.\n\nBut we have warriors back in Washington, and you have five of them right here. Gus Bilirakis. (Applause.) Gus. Where\u2019s Gus? Thank you, Gus. Great job. The legendary Neal Dunn. (Applause.) Neal, thank you. These guys are warriors. Ross Spano. (Applause.) Thanks, Ross. Michael Waltz. (Applause.) Michael. Great job he does on television. All of them, they do a great job. They\u2019re defending us. They\u2019re not defending me; they\u2019re defending us, because that was the greatest election victory maybe in history. And they\u2019re defending us. (Applause.)\n\nAnd a man with one of the best names in the history of politics: Daniel Webster. (Applause.) What a name. If I had that name, I would\u2019ve been President 10 years ago. (Laughter.) Thank you. Thanks, Daniel. Thanks, everybody. Great job.\n\nThey really are \u2014 they\u2019re warriors. They go back and they fight, and they fight corruption. And it\u2019s corruption, what\u2019s going on right now. When you see this going on, it\u2019s pure corruption.\n\nAs we gather this afternoon, Medicare is under threat like never before. Your know that. You have people that are running for office who \u2014 if it ever happened, you will not be very happy here.\n\nAlmost every major Democrat in Washington has backed a massive government healthcare takeover that would totally obliterate Medicare. These Democrat policy proposals may go by different names \u2014 they have all of these wonderful names like \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Wacko! (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: It\u2019ll never end. I\u2019m sorry I smiled. They\u2019ll have me \u2014 the fake news is back there. Look at all of them.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They\u2019ll say, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s terrible \u2014 the President\u2019s smile.\u201d You know, they want me to admonish you. Who said that? \u201cLock her up.\u201d Stand up, please. (Applause.) I\u2019m admonishing you. Never ever say that again. That\u2019s okay. Sit down. (Laughter.) He\u2019s admonished, so now they can\u2019t do their fake number on us. Thank you.\n\nBut they may go by different names, whether it\u2019s \u201csingle-payer\u201d or the so-called \u201cpublic option,\u201d but they\u2019re all based on the totally same, terrible idea. They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing called socialism. Any socialists in the room? I don\u2019t think so. Not too many. Anybody?\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: No? No? Not too many in The villages. You don\u2019t \u2014 you\u2019re not big on socialism down here, right? These geniuses \u2014 these real estate geniuses that know we\u2019re not \u2014 not too good.\n\nEvery one of these plans involves rationing care, restricting access, denying coverage, slashing quality, and massively raising taxes. They want to raise your taxes.\n\nThey also want to have open borders, so the people can just come in and do whatever they want to do.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: And they have no idea who\u2019s coming in, by the way. They have no idea. But, you know, when these countries \u2014 and now we\u2019re getting along great with the countries. Mexico gave us 27,000 soldiers guarding our border and the numbers are way down. (Applause.) Twenty-seven thousand. I want to thank Mexico \u2014 the government and the President.\n\nCongressional Democrats\u2019 extreme agenda would destroy our booming economy very quickly. One of the most disturbing proposals from left-wing politicians involves draining your healthcare to finance the open borders that we just discussed. That\u2019s how they want to finance it. Leading Democrats have pledged to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants. They put foreign citizens who break our laws and endanger our country \u2014 they put them way ahead of American citizens like you who obey our laws.\n\nI will never allow these politicians to steal your healthcare and give it away to illegal aliens. (Applause.) And now, in New York, I hear they passed a new regulation that, if you use the word, \u201cillegal immigrant\u201d \u2014 did I hear correctly? They want to charge you a fine of $250,000. In other words, sell your home in The Villages because you happened to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t like illegal immigrants pouring into our country illegally.\u201d We want people to come into our country legally, through a process. And we\u2019re all in favor of that. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, by the way, the Fake News will cut that last part of the sentence off. (Laughter.) They\u2019ll just put the first part. And they\u2019ll say, \u201cMan, is he rough? He\u2019s too tough. I can\u2019t vote for him.\u201d\n\nA nation must put its own citizens first. My administration is standing up for American seniors. (Applause.) And we\u2019ll always protect the Medicare benefits you earned and paid for.\n\nIn the last administration, Democrats slashed Medicare by $800 billion dollars to pay for Obamacare. Not too good \u2014 Obamacare.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Now one of their new proposals, backed by more than 130 Democrat members of Congress, would cost \u2014 listen to this number \u2014 $32 trillion dollars. And that\u2019s on the low side \u2014 $32 trillion, with a \u201cT\u201d. We\u2019re beyond the \u201cB\u2019s\u201d, the billions. And reduce Americans\u2019 household income by $17,000 per year. Is there anybody in this room that doesn\u2019t mind losing $17,000 a year? No? In order to get lousy healthcare.\n\nThough they use many labels, all of the Democrat plans would devastate our healthcare system. The fake moderates on the left are telling the same lies they did under the last administration. But the last administration, frankly, was moderate compared to the maniacs that you\u2019re hearing from today. These are maniacs. (Applause.)\n\nElizabeth \u201cPocahontas\u201d Warren. You know, when I used to hit her, I thought she was gone, Ron. I thought she was gone. She came up from the ashes. She emerged. (Laughter.) Now, we\u2019re probably going to have to do it again, because I don\u2019t see Sleepy Joe making it, I\u2019ll tell you. (Laughter and applause.) No, I thought she was gone.\n\nUnder this administration, we believe that every American family has a right of choice \u2014 you have a right to choose. Choice. So important. Like what we did with the vets. Choice. Where they can go out and get a doctor instead of waiting in line for three weeks, four weeks, two months. (Applause.) Choice. And you look at the doctor and you look at the plan that is best for you.\n\nThe truth is, there is no longer a moderate wing of congressional Democrats. They\u2019ve gone crazy. They\u2019ve been hijacked by the radical left. I mean, these people on the left, these people are \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Wacko! (Laughter.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Laughs.) Is that the same guy? I think so. (Laughter.) I sort of like him. I can\u2019t admonish him again. (Laughter.) I think it\u2019s the same guy. Got a powerful voice.\n\nDemocrat lawmakers are not trying to build up the country; they only want to wreck and destroy all of the things that we\u2019ve built up over the last three and a half years, four years, five years \u2014 (applause) \u2014 prior to us getting in here. You look at the stock market numbers from the time of the election, from that November 9th date, go a date later. Wasn\u2019t November 8 \u2014 was that one of the great times? Huh? (Applause.) 2016.\n\nBut go a day later, and you look at the numbers in the stock market up way over 50 percent. The 401(k)s are doing unbelievably well. One of these people gets in \u2014 your 401(k)s are going to hell, the stock market is going to hell. Frankly, I think \u2014 and I hate to say it \u2014 the country is going to go to hell. (Applause.)\n\nThey\u2019re consumed by rage and radicalism and insatiable lust for power. Well, how about Justice Kavanaugh? They talk about a woman \u2014 (applause). They talk about a woman, about horrible things that he never even thought about. Horrible, horrible things. And the following day, they want to impeach him. And then, the following day, she said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t remember anything. I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d And they say, \u201cWe don\u2019t care. We want to impeach him anyway.\u201d Now, what they\u2019re trying to do is turn his vote liberal. But he\u2019s a much tougher guy than that. (Applause.) I hope. (Laughs.) He\u2019s a much tougher guy.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: So are you!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Yeah, I better be. I\u2019ll tell you. If I weren\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be up here right now. With all that we have to put up with these people, we wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nDemocrat healthcare proposals would put everyone into a single, socialist, government-run program that would end private insurance for over 180 million Americans. I\u2019m sort of smiling to myself as I \u2014 as I go through these numbers. And I\u2019m dealing with people that I know. I mean, I know the people in this room. Those are the people. I grew up with you. When we were young, I grew up with you. And now we\u2019re sort of still young at heart, at least. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that I\u2019m even talking about socialism is like \u2014 it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s sort of a weird feeling to be talking to you about \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be socialist.\u201d And you\u2019re probably saying, \u201cWhy is he wasting his time?\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a movement on. And it\u2019s not so easy to be beat them when they get up in a debate and they say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut your college tuition to nothing. We\u2019re going kno- \u2014 knock off $1.6 trillion. We\u2019re going to do all these other things. Everything is free, except for your taxes.\u201d Your taxes are going to go up at a level that nobody has even seen before and that won\u2019t be nearly enough to pay for it.\n\nBut I\u2019ll not let any of this bad stuff happen. It\u2019s very important that we win this race. You know, when we won last time, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the most important election in our country\u2019s history.\u201d Because we were ready to go over the edge. (Applause.)\n\nAnd now our country is doing great. But, you know, it\u2019s like a plant \u2014 it\u2019s like a tree. It has to grab \u2014 those roots have to grab hold. We still need more time. We\u2019ve done so much, but we need a little more time. That thing has to grow and it\u2019s got to get in there and then nobody is going to be able to take it down no matter what happens later on. So important. (Applause.)\n\nIn America, we believe in freedom and liberty, not government domination and government control. Today, standing in solidarity with our nation\u2019s seniors, I declare once again that America will never be a socialist country \u2014 it will never be. (Applause.) Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE: Four more years! Four more years! Four more years!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You want to drive them crazy? Don\u2019t do \u201cfour more years.\u201d Say \u201ceight more years.\u201d You\u2019ll drive them crazy. (Laughter.)\n\nOne of these crazy maniacs on a show was interviewing somebody \u2014 radical Left \u2014 and he goes, \u201cYou know he\u2019s going to win, don\u2019t you?\u201d Big show. And the guy goes, \u201cNo, no. We\u2019re going to fight him. We\u2019re going to\u2026\u201d \u201cNo, no, no. He\u2019s going to win. And you know he\u2019s never getting out. You know that don\u2019t you?\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cHe\u2019s not going to get out. You know he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd I thought, like \u2014 you know, he\u2019s a comedian. I thought he was like kidding and having fun. He meant it. (Laughter.) These people are sick. They meant it.\n\nAnyway \u2014 but, no, if you want to drive them crazy, just say \u201ceight more years\u201d or \u201ctwelve more years\u201d \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 or \u201csixteen.\u201d Sixteen would do it good. They would \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you would really drive them into the loony bin. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s why they do the impeachment crap, because they know they can\u2019t beat us fairly. That\u2019s the only reason they\u2019re doing it. They can\u2019t win. They can\u2019t win. (Applause.) If they won, it would be a sad day for our country. It\u2019ll be a sad, sad day for our country if they ever won.\n\nAmong those who would be hit hardest by the socialist takeover are 24 million seniors on Medicare Advantage \u2014 a lot of you. One out of two Hispanic seniors, one out of three African-American seniors is enrolled in Medicare Advantage. This very popular Medicare program \u2014 been around for a long time \u2014 allows private plans to compete to offer senior citizens the absolute best healthcare. They want to destroy it.\n\nWhile many Democrat plans would eliminate Medicare Advantage, my administration is fighting to make it even better and much, much stronger. (Applause.)\n\nAnd thanks to our efforts, there are nearly 1,200 more Medicare Advantage plans today than there were just two years ago. Think of that. (Applause.) Premiums have plummeted by 28 percent; they\u2019ve gone down. And they\u2019re now at the lowest level in over 10 years.\n\nWith us today is Corey Spangler. She lives just up the road in Summerfield. Corey, please tell us some of what we\u2019ve been discussing on Medicare Advantage and your plan, and how important it is to you. Please, come up, Corey, wherever you may be. Oh, Corey.\n\nMS. SPANGLER: I\u2019m right here. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Corey.\n\nMS. SPANGLER: Okay. My family came to America from Mexico when I was five years old because my father did not like the corruption and we had socialized medicine there. He came to this country legally.\n\nAnd when I turned 65, I had some heart issues. I went to the doctor. They scheduled me with a cardiologist. He scheduled me for a stress test on a Wednesday. Pass \u2014 I didn\u2019t \u2014 I failed that test. So he scheduled me for a heart cath the next day. I failed that. They told me you need to have a bypass and I was going to have five bypasses done.\n\nThe following Monday, I was in surgery with my five pass \u2014 five bypasses, and I went home the following Friday. This would never happen with Medicare for All. I love my Medicare Advantage plan, because I can choose the doctor, when I need it, and get the care I need in a quickly manner. And it wouldn\u2019t happen with Medicare for All. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: That\u2019s beautiful.\n\nMS. SPANGLER: Thank you, Mr. President, for saving my care \u2014 healthcare.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Corey. (Applause.)\n\nI see a future politician there. That was \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 boy, she was so like calm. No nerves. You know, sometimes I\u2019ll see people, they get a little bit nervous. Very good.\n\nWhat a job they\u2019ve done. Great doctors. Did you choose your own doctor or you get lucky with a good doctor that was recommended?\n\nMS. SPANGLER: They were wonderful.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: They were wonderful. That\u2019s fantastic. And you\u2019re wonderful. Thank you, Corey. Appreciate it. (Applause.)\n\nThe Democrat plans for socialized medicine will not just put doctors and hospitals out of business, they\u2019ll also deny your treatment and everything that you need. Government-run healthcare systems always end up imposing rationing. You see what happens.\n\nYou look at Venezuela; take a look at that. Fifteen years ago, it\u2019s one of the wealthiest countries. Now they don\u2019t have food. They don\u2019t have water. The hospitals are a disaster. No electricity. No anything. It\u2019s very sad. And we\u2019re helping the people as much as we can. But we\u2019re watching that whole situation \u2014 beyond this, we\u2019re watching it very, very carefully. We\u2019re watching it very carefully. And Cuba \u2014 we\u2019re watching Cuba very carefully. Very, very carefully. (Applause.)\n\nBut as an example, under the United Kingdom\u2019s single-payer system, patients wait 117 days to receive, as an example, a knee replacement. One hundred and seventeen days.\n\nIn Canada, wait times for orthopedic surgery are over 270 days. But currently in the United States, wait times for these surgeries are \u2014 we\u2019ve speeded it up a lot \u2014 are typically less than two weeks. Is that right, Alex? (Applause.)\n\nAnd I have many people coming down from Canada, and I say, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d They\u2019re getting an operation of some kind. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get it up there?\u201d They said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like what you\u2019ve been able to do in a short period of time.\u201d And we\u2019re making it even better.\n\nWith us today is Charles McLaughlin, a 71-year-old Floridian and a Marine veteran of the Vietnam War. Charles, please come up and tell us your story. Please. (Applause.)\n\nMR. MCLAUGHLIN: Oh, man. (Applause.)\n\nHello to The Villages! What a great place you guys have here. Wow. I understand that approximately 60 percent of all of you are veterans. I want to say thank you for your service. (Applause.) And to my Vietnam brothers and sisters: Welcome home.\n\n(Applause.) Welcome home.\n\nMy name is Chuck McLaughlin, and I\u2019m a Vietnam combat Marine. I\u2019m also a cancer survivor \u2014 Stage 4 style. I know a lot about Medicare and the supplement. I used it for breathing tubes, feeding tubes, stitches, staples, MRIs, PET scans, CAT scans, blood tests, hydration shots, chemo treatments, radiation treatments, six months of hypobaric chamber \u2014 to name a few.\n\nAnyone that\u2019s cured, like me, loves their doctors. Loves their doctors. (Applause.) I also want to say: My family, financially, would\u2019ve been destroyed without Medicare. Destroyed. The facts are now (inaudible) the politicians on the left are pushing Medicare for All. I say the result will be no Medicare at all. It will collapse under the load \u2014 the load of the system. It will overload of it. The lines would be incredible. Who knows? I probably wouldn\u2019t be here.\n\nAs far as free stuff, it may be free stuff, but it\u2019s going to come out of somebody else\u2019s pocket. There\u2019s no such thing as \u201cfree.\u201d Period. (Applause.)\n\nIs the Medicare system perfect? No. But it worked for me. Remember, I paid my share.\n\nJust a few thoughts: President Trump\u2019s plan of Medicare Advantage will give me more flexibility for options to this system. I can pick and choose my needs. Secondly, a program that helps protect us seniors for a fair shake as our bodies fail us. And number three, we must get rid of the waste and fraud that seems to be in the newspapers weekly. Finally, thank you, President Trump, for all you do. (Applause.)\n\nI want to personally thank him for what he does for our veterans. (Applause.)\n\nFinally, and may God bless you and your family for loving America and giving us a renewed hope for our children and our grandchildren. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: What a great job. Well, thank you very much, Charles. And it\u2019s incredible. You\u2019ve gone through a lot.\n\nMR. MCLAUGHLIN: Yep.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: You don\u2019t look it. (Laughter.) He\u2019s looking handsome to me, I\u2019ll tell you. (Laughter.) Thanks, Charles. That\u2019s incredible.\n\nLike you, all of us today understand the truth. Socialism is not about improving the health of American people; it\u2019s about wielding power over the American people, taking things away from the American people. (Applause.)\n\nIn a few moments, I will sign an executive order to strengthen Medicare for seniors, and very substantially. I\u2019ll provide Medicare Advantage plans with new tools and options, and it will help Medicare beneficiaries gain faster access to the very latest and greatest medical devices and therapies.\n\nMy order also pursues reductions in the unnecessary regulations that you don\u2019t need, you don\u2019t want to see \u2014 that never come into effect and that cost a lot of money \u2014 enabling doctors and nurses to spend less time on paperwork and more time with their patients that they love. (Applause.)\n\nTo further protect seniors, we are taking action to stop fraud and to stop abuse. It\u2019s tremendous amounts of money saved with that. And we\u2019ll be able to put that money right back into what we want to have it to take care of you.\n\nI\u2019m directing Secretary Azar to crack down on criminals, cheaters, and dishonest providers who rob Medicare of the funds you have and the money that you\u2019ve paid into the system all of your lives. Charles said it. Charles said, \u201cYou know, I paid for it.\u201d He said he paid for it. And now they want to say, \u201cLet\u2019s give it to everybody else.\u201d And it\u2019s going to be gone in a very short number of years. But you did pay for it. You both paid for it.\n\nToday\u2019s action is the only really great action that we can take. It\u2019s the only choice we have because this is going to be something that\u2019s better than any place anywhere in the world. It\u2019s the latest of many important steps that we\u2019re taking to dramatically improve healthcare for the American people.\n\nOur vision for the future of health in America has four crucial parts. And we will protect vulnerable patients, number one. We will protect those patients that are so terribly vulnerable. We will deliver the affordability that you need. Prices coming down. As I said, prescription drug prices \u2014 first time in over 50 years, Alex, that drug prices have come down for the year. (Applause.) Your average prescription drug price \u2014 first time in 50 years \u2014 over 50 years.\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to get them a lot lower. And I think Ron is going to have some big surprises. We\u2019ll be announcing that pretty soon. Some \u2014 for really, really big reductions. People are already \u2014 they\u2019re not even going to know what happened. So that\u2019s what we want. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we\u2019re going to give you options and control that you want. And we will provide the quality you deserve.\n\nFirst, we\u2019re protecting vulnerable Americans.\n\nWe have made a clear promise to America\u2019s patients: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. (Applause.) The Republicans will always protect preexisting conditions. (Applause.)\n\nTo stop families from being blindsided by outrageous medical bills \u2014 and this is something that is one of the most exciting things to me \u2014 I have challenged Congress to send a bill to my desk that stops the horrendous practice of surprise medical billing. So many of you, you go in and you have something, and then you get a bill and you say, \u201cHow is it possible?\u201d And we\u2019re going to end that practice. That practice is not a fair practice. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we\u2019re also confronting the opioid and drug addiction epidemic that is plaguing too many American communities. And thanks to our efforts \u2014 and we\u2019ve worked so hard on it; the First Lady worked so hard. Kellyanne Conway \u2014 where\u2019s Kellyanne? (Applause.) Where\u2019s Kellyanne? Where is she? Kellyanne, thank you. Thank you, Kellyanne. (Applause.)\n\nLast year, drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly three decades. Early data shows that drug overdose deaths dropped 10 percent last year in the state of Florida. Now, think of that. That\u2019s \u2014 you know, we\u2019d like to better. It\u2019s a very, very tough situation. And one of the things we\u2019re doing with the \u201cpain pills\u201d \u2014 we can call them \u2014 we\u2019re trying to find, and we\u2019re really working hard and we\u2019re funding a lot of research to find pain pills that aren\u2019t addictive. You go into to a hospital with a broken arm, and you come out and you\u2019re drug addict. And we\u2019re trying to find, and we\u2019re getting closer \u2014 I think we\u2019re getting very close, actually \u2014 to finding painkillers that aren\u2019t addictive. And we\u2019ll have that in the not-too-distant future. (Applause.)\n\nAnd to care for our great veterans, we passed VA Accountability. You know what that is, right? This is where the great heroes and tough people \u2014 but \u2014 and, by the way, in their super prime, nobody touched them.\n\nBut they\u2019re more vulnerable, and people would take advantage of our veterans. You had sadists. You had people that would rob them and rob the system. You had some horrible people. We couldn\u2019t fire anybody. They had, in Arizona, people that got stealing \u2014 they got caught stealing $400,000. They couldn\u2019t fire them. So now we have VA Accountability. You think that was easy? They\u2019ve been trying to get it for 50 years. And I got it. I\u2019m good at getting things. (Applause.)\n\nSo now, when they don\u2019t take proper care of our vets, we say, \u201cJim, get the hell out of here. You\u2019re fired. Get out of here.\u201d (Applause.) We can fire them. Get them out. We get them out. We don\u2019t have to ask questions. We get them out. If they\u2019re bad, they treat our veterans badly, we fire them. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t hear about \u2014 you know, before me, every night you\u2019d see these stories, these horror stories about the VA. I haven\u2019t seen one in a long time. Now, I don\u2019t want to wish it because the fake news will search the system \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 to find somebody that\u2019s not happy. \u201cWe found somebody. We found a vet in Florida who isn\u2019t quite happy with everything. Let\u2019s do a major story.\u201d\n\nBut do you remember all of the bad stories that used to be about the VA? Now you don\u2019t see that because they have accountability. We can fire bad people. We fired a tremendous number of really bad people that should\u2019ve been fired years ago. (Applause.)\n\nI don\u2019t like firing people, but I like firing people that don\u2019t treat our vets great, that aren\u2019t doing their job. And they were protected, frankly, by the unions, and they were protected by civil service \u2014 very powerful. Do you think it was easy beating unions and civil service? Not too easy. But I explained to them too. I said, \u201cThis is good for all of us. It\u2019s good for America.\u201d\n\nAnd the other, as I said, is VA Choice, where our veterans no longer have to wait for endless, endless hours, days \u2014 even months. We\u2019ve had cases where a person is on line \u2014 not bad; could be fixed up very easily with whatever treatment it may be \u2014 and they end up being terminal by the time they see a doctor. That\u2019s not happening anymore. (Applause.) Because now you go out, you find a great local doctor, we pay the bill.\n\nAnd, you know, it\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s totally less important but we also save a lot of money on that. Hard to believe, we save a lot of money. It\u2019s much less expensive for us to do that than the other way, and it\u2019s saving tremendous numbers of lives. And we have great doctors, frankly, that need the business. Not so bad.\n\nTo protect healthcare for our seniors and all Americans, my administration is taking strong actions to ensure that newcomers to our society do not drain our healthcare system, or burden the services that you depend on. You see these people in California, the governor of California \u2014 \u201cCome on in, everybody.\u201d Then you wonder why people are flooding our borders. \u201cCome on in. You have free education, free healthcare. Everybody gets a Rolls-Royce.\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cCome on in. Come on in.\u201d\n\nYou know, to show you how corrupt CNN is, when I used that expression, they said, \u201cThe President wasn\u2019t telling the truth. He said they get a Rolls-Royce and they don\u2019t.\u201d (Laughter.) Ahh, they don\u2019t get it, do they? They never got it.\n\nSome idiot at CNN said, \u201cYou can\u2019t win without CNN. I guess we showed them.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) I guess we showed them. (Applause.) And their ratings are so low now that they are no longer the big difference at all. They have really bad ratings.\n\nBut you know what is bad for our country? When CNN \u2014 so often I go to a foreign country. I go to a country. I meet leaders. And he said, \u201cWhy do they hate your country so much?\u201d I said, \u201cWho?\u201d You know, CNN outside of the United States is much more important than it is in the United States. And a lot of what you see here is broadcast throughout the world. And we used to have Radio Free \u2014 I think Radio Free Europe and Voice of America. And we did that to build up our country. And that\u2019s not working out too well.\n\nBut CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there. And it\u2019s a terrible thing for our country. And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad. (Applause.) They are so bad for our country. They are so bad for our country. I go out there and they say, \u201cBoy, the media hates your country.\u201d And it\u2019s just a shame. It\u2019s just a shame. And we really are \u2014 we are looking at that. We should do something about it, too. Put some really talented people and get a real voice out there, not a voice that\u2019s fake.\n\nWhen Americans are struck by natural disaster, like they were in Florida where I was with you, Hurricane Michael \u2014 did I do a good job, Governor? Did I do a good job? (Applause.) Man.\n\nYour governor came to my office once a week. He always needed more money \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 and I always gave it, right? He didn\u2019t stop. I hated it. I said, \u201cKeep DeSantis. I don\u2019t want to see him anymore.\u201d (Laughter.) But we always gave it, and you got it. And your people worked so hard. And FEMA and the military, they all worked with you. The Coast Guard is incredible, what the Coast Guard has done. (Applause.) I think the Coast Guard has really done a great job.\n\nThe second part of our healthcare agenda is to promote the affordability of America\u2019s needs. Thanks to our focus on lower drug prices, the FDA approved more low-cost generic drugs in my first two years than ever before in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of that. (Applause.)\n\nAnd every time I\u2019d see the folks over at FDA, I\u2019d say, \u201cCome on, fellas. Let\u2019s go. Faster. Faster.\u201d You know, don\u2019t forget, when somebody was dying and we had a drug that looked like it was really good but it wasn\u2019t going be approved for like four more years \u2014 it used to be 12 years and we brought it way down. I mean, it\u2019s too long. But we brought it way, way down. But a person is dying and they said, \u201cNo, sir, we can\u2019t give that because it may harm the person.\u201d I said, \u201cWait a minute, you don\u2019t understand.\u201d (Laughter.) \u201cA person is terminally ill, they\u2019ve got four weeks to live, and you don\u2019t want to give them a drug because you think it\u2019s going to harm them? I guarantee you I can get them to sign a document.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nNow we got that approved \u2014 Right to Try. And, by the way, miracles are happening. Right? Miracles. (Applause.) Miracles are happening.\n\nHopefully, it never happens to anybody in this room. But, frankly, people would go to Asia, they\u2019d go to Europe, they\u2019d go all over the world seeking a cure, if they had money. If they didn\u2019t have money, they\u2019d go home and they\u2019d die. But now they don\u2019t have to do that.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t easy because the drug companies didn\u2019t want it because they didn\u2019t want to have terminally ill because it looks bad on the percentage record, right? The insurance companies didn\u2019t want it because there are a lot of reasons. You know what the reasons are. Our government didn\u2019t want it because they didn\u2019t want to be sued by a patient that died that would\u2019ve died anyway. So I said, \u201cHere\u2019s what we do, folks: We sign an agreement. And the agreement holds everybody non-liable.\u201d\n\nWe took the drug companies and we created a separate list, so they\u2019re not on that list \u2014 because it is, right? It\u2019s a problem. And we took a separate list. So now we have a totally separate list \u2014 confidential list \u2014 but they don\u2019t get hurt by somebody that was so sick that this person may not make it. And I got everybody to sign it and we were done. It was pretty amazing. And then we got it approved in Congress because of these five great congressmen back there, including Ron, who at the time was in Congress. (Applause.) Right? With Greg and everybody, we got it done and we got the Senate to approve it. And I signed it. And I was really happy. Right to Try. Hopefully you never need it.\n\nWe also ended the terrible gag clauses that prevented pharmacists from telling you about cheaper options at the pharmacy counter. Do you believe it? I thought this was \u2014 I thought they were kidding me the first time. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019ve only been doing this for three years, okay? So, you know. (Laughter.)\n\nThese guys have been doing it a long time. But they\u2019re not allowed to talk to you about pricing. I said, \u201cWait. You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d And they weren\u2019t. But I got rid of that. Now they can talk about pricing. You can go out and price. You can go to different places. They have to be open and transparent. That was a big deal. (Applause.) That was a big deal. (Applause.)\n\nAnd all of these things, you know, they sound so simple; they\u2019re tough to get. They\u2019ve been that way for many years for a reason. You have very powerful lobbyists. You have drug companies, frankly, that don\u2019t want that. Why would they want that, where you can negotiate price? Why would they want a thing like that?\n\nMy administration is also working to require drug companies to disclose prices in their television advertisements. And we\u2019re almost getting to a point where we\u2019re going to be able to get that. So you\u2019re going to know what you\u2019re paying up front. They can\u2019t triple-hit you. (Applause.)\n\nEssentially, we\u2019re holding Big Pharma accountable. And that\u2019s okay; they do just fine.\n\nEarlier this year, we announced another groundbreaking action seniors have wanted for decades. We will soon allow the safe and legal importation of prescription drugs from other countries, including the country of Canada, where, believe it or not, they pay much less money for the exact same drug. (Applause.) Stand up, Ron. Boy, he wants this so badly. (Applause.)\n\nNo, I mean, you go to some countries and the price is like 50, 60 percent lower \u2014 even more than that, I guess, Ron, in some cases. And it\u2019s 50, 60 percent lower \u2014 the exact same pill, from the exact same factory, from the exact same company. And I say, \u201cWhy is it that in Europe \u2014 certain places, in particular \u2014 it\u2019s 25 percent of what we pay back here?\u201d I said, \u201cIt must be a different manufacturer.\u201d \u201cNo, sir, it\u2019s the same one.\u201d \u201cMust be made in a different factory.\u201d \u201cNo, sir, it\u2019s the same one.\u201d Everything is identical; they pay 25 percent. We pick up all of the research and development. We pick up everything like a bunch of, excuse me, schmucks. (Laughter.) Schmucks. Right? (Applause.)\n\nNot anymore, folks, because in a little while \u2014 (applause) \u2014 in a little while, your governor is going to be able to go out and negotiate until his heart is content. And he\u2019s going to go to Canada. I know he\u2019s gone there already and he\u2019s looking at their pricing, and he\u2019s going to some of the European countries and others, and he\u2019s going to get his drug price down to a level that you can\u2019t believe. It\u2019s going to be a great thing. And we\u2019ll see what happens. It\u2019s going to be very interesting. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I have a feeling when that happens, the drug companies are just going to say, \u201cWe can\u2019t have this.\u201d And they\u2019re going to drop their price, I think.\n\nNow, they\u2019re very smart. They may go the other way, and if they do, don\u2019t blame me, okay? (Laughter.) But I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to do fantastically, Ron. You feel good about it? Huh? You better do good; otherwise, you\u2019re making us both look bad. (Laughter.) You hear that, Casey?\n\nAmerican patients must no longer be forced to subsidize lower drug prices in other countries through higher prices in America. That\u2019s what we were doing. We were paying a much higher price. My administration will never stop fighting for lower costs for American patients and American seniors.\n\nThe third part of our healthcare vision is to provide the choice and control Americans want. We eliminated Obamacare\u2019s horrible, horrible, very expensive and very unfair, unpopular individual mandate. A total disaster. That was a big penalty. (Applause.) That was a big thing. Where you paid a lot of money for the privilege of not having to pay a lot of money for the privilege of having no healthcare. You paid not to have healthcare. It was a penalty. And how it ever held up in Supreme Court, I don\u2019t know, but it did. But we just got rid of it. We just did it the old-fashioned way: We got rid of it.\n\nWe vastly expanded affordable insurance options, including association health plans, short-term plans, and health reimbursement arrangements \u2014 which are incredible. And many of these options are up to 60 percent less expensive than \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d (Applause.) Nobody got that. (Laughs.) Nobody got that. That\u2019s okay. \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d I didn\u2019t say \u201cObamacare.\u201d I said \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d (Laughter.) President \u201cO-bomb-a-care.\u201d He can have it.\n\nBut we\u2019ve done a great job in running it. We almost had it done. We unfortunately had one vote \u2014 middle of the night \u2014 just when thumbs down. That wasn\u2019t good. After years and years of campaigning \u2014 \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d right? But we\u2019ve done a great job because we get rid of the individual mandate. And we\u2019re running it better. It\u2019s still no good, because it\u2019s too expensive. The premium is way too high and all of the elements of it. It\u2019s just not good. But we\u2019re coming up with an incredible plan that if the Republicans take back the House, keep the Senate, keep the presidency, we\u2019re going to have a fantastic plan. (Applause.) Right?\n\nFollowing my administration\u2019s recommendation, Florida has taken an important step to lower cost and increase choice by repealing a misguided Certificate of Need law, used by hospitals to block competition. We encourage other states to follow Florida\u2019s example. They\u2019ve done a great job right here. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I also signed, just recently, a revolutionary executive order requiring price and quality transparency. And the man who\u2019s really the leader in the world of this \u2014 it\u2019s transparency. You can pick your doctor; you can look at their records; you can see how well they did. You can go and negotiate. A man \u2014 what really sold me on it \u2014 the man who\u2019s the best in the world at it, who we used, and we gave you the max plan. Did we give that? The max plan, right? That\u2019s the maximum plan. We gave it to you. And he said something that I loved. He said, \u201cSir, this is more important and will go down as more important than any healthcare that you\u2019ll ever come up with.\u201d And I said, \u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Now, who knows if it\u2019s true, but I guess, from what I\u2019m hearing, they\u2019ve done it in certain limited areas and it\u2019s phenomenal.\n\nAnd it\u2019s really transparency. And you\u2019ll be able to negotiate all over the place. And you\u2019ll be able to pick everything you want, from the hospital to the doctor. And it\u2019s going to save you a tremendous amount of money. And there are those that say it\u2019s more important than even healthcare at a high \u2014 at a high level.\n\nAnd fourth, my administration is fighting to ensure the high-quality care that Americans deserve. Americans have to get the highest quality. So we have the highest quality that Americans deserve.\n\nOn behalf of 5 million Americans living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, I signed into law a $1 billion increase in funding for critical Alzheimer\u2019s research. And we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. (Applause.)\n\nAnd just one other thing I will tell you \u2014 because it even surprised me \u2014 but we\u2019ve funded it now, and, within 10 years, our country will be AIDS-free. Can you believe that? AIDS-free. (Applause.) Tremendous progress has been made.\n\nAnd when we were talking about that, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How does this\u2026\u201d It\u2019s like somewhat of a secret, but it\u2019s incredible \u2014 the tremendous progress that we\u2019ve made over the last few years on AIDS and AIDS research. And we should be essentially AIDS-free. Do you agree with that, Mr. Secretary?\n\nIn my State of the Union, I announced a plan to invest \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 she liked it \u2014 $500 million dollars in new treatments, and cures, and all of the things that we have to go through with our incredible children, in some cases, for childhood cancers. It\u2019s a tremendous problem.\n\nAnd to bring new hope to the nearly 100,000 Americans currently awaiting a kidney operation, I signed an executive order that will significantly increase the supply of kidneys available for transplant. It\u2019s such a big deal. It\u2019s so big. You have no idea. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we worked hard on that. And, you know, what a lot of people don\u2019t know \u2014 a lot of it is just the work. The people die fairly quickly because it\u2019s not \u2014 they could go on forever. But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable amounts of work, going in all the time for step-by-step \u2014 what you have to do.\n\nAnd so, with kidney transplants, we\u2019re making tremendous progress. And we funded a lot of money toward it. And I think it\u2019s going to be a tremendous thing for people that are just literally suffering with something they can really do very well with.\n\nWe\u2019re delivering better, fairer, and more affordable healthcare for all Americans, especially our cherished senior citizens. And we will stop at nothing to deliver better healthcare for you and for your family. I will never let you down. You have been incredible to me and I will never ever forget you. I will never let you down. I promise that. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much.\n\nWe\u2019re lowering the cost of prescription drugs, taking on the pharmaceutical companies. And you think that\u2019s easy? It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not easy. They come at you from all different sides. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the hoax didn\u2019t come a little bit from some of the people that we\u2019re taking on. They\u2019re very powerful. They spend a lot of money \u2014 spend, I think, more money than any other group in the world actually, in terms of lobbying and lobbying abilities.\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some of the nonsense that we all have to go through, but that I go through \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was from these \u2014 some of these industries like pharmaceuticals that we take on because I want \u2014 I don\u2019t care. I did great. I\u2019ve had a great life. I want to get drug prices down. I don\u2019t care about the companies I want to get drug prices down.\n\nI want to continue to give them the incentive to come out with new and better answers, but got to get drug prices down. And they\u2019ve made a fortune over the last 40 years. They\u2019ve made so much money. And they\u2019ve got the system wired. Because everything you do, their stock goes up. I said, \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Their stock just went up.\u201d They said, \u201cSir, it\u2019s going to be wonderful.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be wonderful.\u201d Let their stock go down a little bit. But their stock goes up. And what we\u2019ve done is incredible.\n\nAnd, by the way, you have some incredible companies. The answers that they \u2014 we \u2014 we want to keep them strong and powerful and wealthy, and we want them to con- \u2014 really continue to do that research. But we got to get those prices down. They\u2019re far too high, especially when you compare them to other countries.\n\nAnd we want to ensure access to the doctors of your choice. And every day, we are going to \u2014 as I said, we are going to defend Medicare like Medicare has never been defended again. And it\u2019s never needed the defense. It\u2019s always been incredible. It\u2019s something that worked and they want to destroy it.\n\nIn my administration, we know that Medicare is personal. Great healthcare is about more time with the ones you love, more days with your grandkids, and more freedom to enjoy the most rewarding years of your life \u2014 or what should be, by far, the most rewarding years of your life. You\u2019ve worked hard. You\u2019ve worked so hard. And you paid for it. And you\u2019ve got to enjoy it. It\u2019s about getting better when you\u2019re sick, it\u2019s improving your well-being, and it\u2019s getting the treatment you need, right when you need it.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in everything we do, we are defending the principles that made America the envy of the world and the American way of life the greatest in our history. And our country has never been greater than it\u2019s been right now. Our military is the strongest it\u2019s ever built \u2014 we rebuilt our entire military. (Applause.)\n\nAnd even medical research is at a new level. It\u2019s at a level that we\u2019ve never had it before.\n\nWe stand for freedom. We stand for choice. We stand for justice, and fairness, and accountability. We stand for loyalty to our citizens, love for our country, allegiance to our flag, and long and healthy lives for our great seniors. (Applause.)\n\nAnd with your help, we are going to continue building the best, most advanced, most cutting-edge healthcare system anywhere in the world. We are going to expand our growing economy to make retirement easier, and better, and far more secure. We\u2019re going to defend American lives, American values, American families, and America\u2019s glorious destiny. There is no country like our country. (Applause.) We see and read things, but there is no country like our country. Right?\n\nWith every ounce of strength and every bit of soul, we are going to protect Medicare for you \u2014 for everyone at The Villages, and for every senior across this magnificent land.\n\nYou are going to be protected in many ways \u2014 but you are going to be protected.\n\nThank you very being here. Thank you for this incredible enthusiasm. God bless you. God bless our senior citizens. And God bless America. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.\n\nOkay. Should I do it? (Applause.) I\u2019ll do it. All right.\n\n(The executive order is signed.) (Applause.)\n\nThank you everybody. Here \u2014 grab these, fellas. Pass them around. The congressmen don\u2019t want (inaudible), and I know that. Here you go. I love that. I love that. I love those guys. \u201cBikers for 45.\u201d These guys. (Laughter and applause.) They\u2019ve been there from the beginning, right? Here. Pass them around. Pass these around, fellas. Pass them around.\n\nCome here. Attorney General, get over here. Come on. Get over here. Lieutenant Governor, come on. Please, both of you. Come on up here. They\u2019re doing a good job, right? Should we give them a pen? I think so. (Applause.) Come on up here. That\u2019s great.\n\nI want to thank you all. Really a special time. And this is \u2014 this is very meaningful for me and for you and for everybody. Thank you all very much. Thank you. (Applause.)\n\nEND\n\n2:49 P.M.
