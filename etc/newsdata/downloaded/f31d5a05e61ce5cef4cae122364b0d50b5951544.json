Elizabeth Warren began her campaign with a challenge to the other Democratic presidential candidates: No super PACs, and no self-funding.\n\nNow, as she firmly ensconces herself in the top tier of 2020 candidates, she\u2019s issuing another challenge: Every other Democratic presidential candidate should reveal the names of any donor or fundraiser who has a title with the campaign, and should report the date, location and host committee of any event they hold to raise funds. She also proposes making such disclosure mandatory if she becomes president.\n\n\u201cIf Democratic candidates for president want to spend their time hobnobbing with the rich and powerful, it is currently legal for them to do so \u2015 but they shouldn\u2019t be handing out secret titles and honors to rich donors,\u201d Warren wrote in a Medium post Tuesday announcing her new campaign finance policy. \u201cVoters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition \u2015 and how much it costs.\u201d\n\nWarren has long made the corrupting influence of money in politics a signature issue. Her new proposal is meant to serve as both a contrast with top rival Joe Biden, who has relied on ties to wealthy donors to fund his campaign war chest, and as preparation for the general election, where Warren hopes to showcase her support for good government measures against President Donald Trump\u2019s corruption. It\u2019s also another signal Warren\u2019s top priority as president would be changing Washington\u2019s internal rules in ways that make progressive successes more likely.\n\n\u201cOur democracy shouldn\u2019t be bought and paid for by the wealthy and powerful. It belongs to all of us. When we use our voices and our votes, we can make real change \u2015 big, structural change,\u201d Warren wrote on Medium. \u201cThat\u2019s why getting big money out of politics and addressing corruption in Washington are so important. These reforms make it possible to do everything else we need to do \u2015 from addressing climate change to forgiving student loans.\u201d\n\nWarren is also proposing a sharp limits on corporate PACs, making it more difficult to set up super PACs dedicated to a single candidate, banning lobbyists from donating to or fundraising for any candidate, significantly reforming the Federal Election Commission, lowering the maximum donation to a federal candidate or committee, and establishing a publicly financed matching program for small donations.\n\nMario Tama via Getty Images Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is getting more aggressive in her calls to rid the 2020 presidential campaign of big-money influence.\n\nWarren promised not to take donations of more than $200 from executives at \u201cbig tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds,\u201d and to turn down corporate donations to the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee next summer. Last week, she announced she wouldn\u2019t hold any fundraisers for her campaign during the general election, but would attend fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee, state Democratic parties and other candidates.\n\nThe chances of Biden and other candidates who use big-money fundraisers to pad their campaign coffers complying with Warren\u2019s challenge to reveal extensive details about their donors and fundraisers are essentially zero \u2015 although the details of many fundraisers leak to the press regardless, and Biden has allowed journalists to cover his fundraisers. But the Warren campaign may view the challenge as a potential way to set herself apart from Biden, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg or other candidates if the race turns ugly.\n\nWarren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the third-leading candidate in the Democratic race, both rely nearly exclusively on small-dollar online fundraising, and have not held high-dollar fundraisers during the campaign.\n\nBeyond her own personal pledges, Warren also wants to sharply limit corporate PACs. Many Democrats in recent years have pledged to not take money from corporate PACs, which are created by companies to bundle donations from executives and funnel them to politicians. Warren would make corporate PAC donations to candidates illegal.\n\nShe\u2019s also proposing making it illegal to consider campaign contributions when appointing ambassadors. Politicians in both parties have used plum diplomatic gigs as a way to reward major campaign donors. And she\u2019ll close a loophole that has allowed some foreign companies to influence American elections.\n\nShe also wants to make it much harder to run a super PAC backing a single candidate. Often, these super PACs are run by operatives who are longtime allies of a politician, and are able to anticipate the candidate\u2019s plan and use the candidate\u2019s authority when courting voters. Warren would bar anyone with a \u201cpolitical, personal, professional, or family relationship\u201d with a candidate from running a super PAC backing them.\n\nWarren would also lower the maximum contribution to a candidate from $2,800 to $1,000, and limit donations to political parties \u2015 which right now can reach into the hundreds of thousands \u2015 to $10,000. At the same time, she would use \u201cpenalties coming from corporate malfeasance and major tax crimes\u201d to fund a program that would provide a 6-to-1 match of any donation under $200.\n\n\u201cLowering contribution limits, combined with 6-1 matching funds for small dollar contributions, will shift incentives for candidates: it will make it less valuable to spend time raising money from big dollar donors and more valuable to spend time with ordinary voters,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\nAnd Warren is proposing changing the structure of the Federal Election Commission, which has been gridlocked in recent years. Instead of a six-person board of three Democrats and three Republicans, she would create a board of two Democrats, two Republicans and a lone independent, making tie votes far less likely. She\u2019s also proposing increasing the FEC\u2019s funding for investigations, and giving it more power to impose fines.", "description": "The Democratic candidate\u2019s stance on getting big money out of politics is getting more aggressive.", "authors": ["Senior Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da54d64210000150e345118.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
