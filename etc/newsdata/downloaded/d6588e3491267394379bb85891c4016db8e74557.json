Requests to Giuliani and the White House have also not been returned.\n\nBoth diGenova and Toensing have been frequent guests on Fox\u2019s opinion shows, specifically Hannity and Lou Dobbs Tonight. This week, during an appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, diGenova blasted Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano as \u201ca fool\u201d for assessing that Trump had committed a crime during his July 25 call with the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe remarks sparked a multi-day, on-air scuffle between Fox News anchor Shepard Smith and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Wallace also appeared to join in the internecine fighting over the network\u2019s coverage of the growing scandal, implicitly criticizing the on-air commentary of some of his Fox News colleagues in recent days.\n\nBoth Toensing and diGenova have been two of the president\u2019s fiercest defenders for years. Along with being frequent guests on Fox opinion shows and other conservative media outlets, the husband-wife team has had a close relationship with the president for a while.\n\nIn March 2018, they were briefly tapped to join Trump\u2019s special counsel legal team. Days later, however, the president decided against hiring the pair.\n\n\u201cThe president is disappointed that conflicts prevent Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing from joining the president\u2019s special counsel legal team,\u201d Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said at the time. \u201cHowever, those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the president in other legal matters. The president looks forward to working with them.\u201d\n\nRevelations this week that Giuliani had been tasked by Trump to coordinate with Attorney General William Barr and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in investigating unproven allegations of corruption involving Biden, his son Hunter, and a Ukrainian energy company have pushed long-simmering Democratic support for an impeachment inquiry against the president to a rolling boil.\n\n\u201cI will have Mr. Giuliani give you a call, and I am also going to have Attorney General Barr call and we will get to the bottom of it,\u201d Trump told Zelensky on a July 25 phone call, according to a rough transcript of the conversation released by the White House this week.\n\nTrump and Giuliani have, without providing evidence, accused the former vice president and frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination of supporting the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect Burisma, an energy company advised by his youngest son, Hunter.\n\n\u201cA lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Trump said on the call with Zelensky, after asking the newly elected president of Ukraine for a \u201cfavor.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution, so if you can look into it... It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nThis story is developing.", "description": "Fox News cited a U.S. official who said all three were working off the books apart from the administration, and the only person who knew \u201cwhat they were doing is President Trump.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona", "Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569773796/fox_he27hf", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
