Scientists gave the youngsters tests and observed their attention.\n\nHalf of the trials reviewed in the British Journal of Sports Medicine were carried out in the US, as well as seven in Australia and five in the UK.\n\nThe rest of the studies took place in China, Croatia, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden.\n\nIn one of the studies, eight and nine-year-olds ran on the spot to simulate travelling the world, in between answering questions on different countries.\n\nExperts concluded the children, who were all from London, were more active and more focused on the task than peers in a control group.\n\nThe team of researchers, who were also led by Dr Norris, noted how they followed instructions from teachers more closely.\n\nAnother one of the trials reviewed found primary school children could also benefit from having physically active lessons.\n\nYoungsters who had three active lessons a week were better at spelling and maths two years later than their peers.\n\nThe lessons included getting children to jump on the spot eight times to solve the multiplication sum two times four.\n\nThe Dutch scientists behind that study then calculated the improvement was the equivalent of four months of extra learning.", "description": "University College London researchers led the review, which also involved experts from the Netherlands, Australia and Singapore.
