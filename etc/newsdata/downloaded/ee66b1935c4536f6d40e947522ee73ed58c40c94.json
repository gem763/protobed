Having crunched the numbers from delicately placed sensors, Mieusset only deepened the mystery. According to his studies, the left one is warmer, but only when a man has his clothes on. Mieusset has invented heated pants for men to wear as an aid to contraception \u2013 he appears to be the sole purveyor of the unorthodox intervention.\n\nBritain\u2019s pride was upheld by Francis McGlone, a researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, who shared the Ig Nobel peace prize. As part of an international team, McGlone helped map out which parts of the body are most pleasurable to scratch. The ankles ranked highest, the researchers found, and then the back and forearm.\n\n\u201cI was over the moon when I heard. It\u2019s nice for all of us. It\u2019s an honour,\u201d McGlone said on hearing he had won. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s fascinated me for a long while now is why is scratching an itch so bloody nice?\u201d\n\nBut there is a serious side to the research, he said. \u201cPeople always laugh about itching, but chronic itch is devastating. People with chronic itch will scratch until it bleeds because the pain is preferable to the itching.\u201d\n\nBy understanding which parts of the body are most prone to itch, and those which are most susceptible to relief, scientists hope to find new treatments for the condition. McGlone, who could not attend the ceremony, accepted the award in a video message recorded with a homunculus on his shoulder.\n\nAs is standard for the annual event, winners pay their own way to Harvard, where the prizes are handed out by bona fide Nobel laureates. The winners each receive a cash prize: a now-obsolete $10tn bill from Zimbabwe.\n\nPatricia Yang and David Hu, both engineers at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, celebrated their second Ig Nobel prize at the ceremony. The researchers bagged their first in 2015 for discovering the \u201claw of urination\u201d, which states that all mammals empty their bladders in about 21 seconds. This year, as part of a larger team, the two share the physics prize for working out how wombats make cube-shaped faeces. The feat, thought to be unique in the animal world, helps them construct stable piles of dung to mark their territory. Contacted about the prize, Yang said: \u201cIt solidifies my belief that curiosity brings joy and surprise in science.\u201d\n\nOther awards included the biology prize for a Chinese-led team that found that dead, magnetised cockroaches behave differently to living, magnetised cockroaches when studied with a quantum sensor; and the medical education prize for a US group that showed that acoustic clickers used in dog training also boost the skills of surgical students.", "description": "Nappy-changing machine and saliva calculation also triumph in annual science prize", "authors": ["Ian Sample"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea3ac7fa430a6fe413487039beea1389e8100ae0/0_42_2112_1267/master/2112.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=95f6b70b6efc7ba3c382ab5b03cf84bd", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
