The stadium hosting the world track and field championship, and the arenas for the 2022 soccer World Cup, are at best distant lights on the horizon.\n\nOn a patch of rocky ground near luxury hotels and a private school, Rakim\u2019s team of Bangladeshis and Nepalis faces a team that has borrowed a work bus to drive in from the suburbs.\n\nThe wicket is smooth concrete, poured in secret at night years ago by construction workers. The bats are imported, costly, prized possessions. The ball was made for tennis, and is tightly wrapped in red tape to add weight.\n\nThey play early in the morning and just before sunset to avoid the hottest part of the day, when temperatures climb well above 100 degrees (38 Celsius) .\n\nMost of the players work grueling hours in the heat six days a week. Friday, the Muslim day of prayer and rest, is their only chance to play, says Rakim, a Bangladeshi electrician who didn\u2019t give a family name. They watch games on TV from back home, where many have families they rarely see.\n\n\u201cWe cannot go to the national team. We can only enjoy this game, and we are happy,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we have a holiday, so we can play.\u201d\n\nEvents like the World Cup or world track championships may as well be in another world. \u201cThose who have good opportunities go to the stadium, but we are normal people. We don\u2019t have opportunities,\u201d Rakim added.\n\nAmid cries from the players in Bengali of \u201cshabash,\u201d or \u201cwell done,\u201d 19-year-old Somundra watches the game. He arrived last year from Nepal, where cricket is far behind soccer in popularity, to work as an office \u201ctea boy\u201d in Qatar.\n\nThe rocky ground, strewn with construction trash, rules out soccer for migrant workers who risk financial hardship if they get injured, so he\u2019s learning cricket by watching the games. Qatar could be the birthplace of a future Nepali international team, jokes Rakim.\n\nLearning the game means batting, bowling and fielding. When team numbers vary and attendance is uncertain, everyone\u2019s an all-rounder.\n\nA few hundred meters away, a group of Sri Lankans play a friendly contest, more of a training session for an upcoming match in one of the several tournaments migrants organize. The team\u2019s star is a construction surveyor with experience of district-level club cricket back home.\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s another game. A few streets away, yet more. In the country pitching itself as soccer\u2019s World Cup host, cricket has taken root first.\n\n___\n\nMore AP cricket: www.apnews.com/cricket and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The most played sport in Qatar is nowhere near the country's glitzy, air-conditioned stadiums.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/qatar_migrants_game_39257_c0-153-4632-2853_s1770x1032.jpg?7a3cf14d36bfc0778f0b3880df2a4f382cceec91", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
