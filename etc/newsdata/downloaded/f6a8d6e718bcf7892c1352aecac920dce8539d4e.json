I\u2019ll start by saying, \u201cThat is not my penis\u201d,\u2019 he told TVLine. \u2018I might need to rejoin Twitter and have #NotMyPenis up there.\u2019\n\n\u2018I had to tell all of my neighbours,\u2019 he continued. \u2018I live near old people, and just in case they happen to watch, I just had to let everyone know that they can look me in the eye.\u2019\n\nWatchmen airs Sundays on HBO in the US and is available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
