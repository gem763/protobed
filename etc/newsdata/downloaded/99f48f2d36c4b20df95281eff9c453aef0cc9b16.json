It's not enough to focus on their food and living facilities, their spiritual needs should also be properly addressed,\" Hao said.\n\nThe nursing home was opened in March by Hao Baozheng, who was involved in preschool education for more than 10 years. To make the nursing home more lively, Hao Baozheng took kids from his kindergarten to the center and designed a range of weekly activities that can meet the needs of both the young and the old.\n\nIt was a rough start, Hao Baozheng said, as some kids were noisy and some found it difficult to bond with the elderly residents. \"But as they got more familiar with each other, everyone got along better and things ran more smoothly,\" he said.\n\nHan Shufen, a 79-year old resident, said \"It's fun and interesting to get up every morning and see the kids doing exercises downstairs and hear the pitter-patter of their little feet.\"\n\nAccording to Hao Baozheng, parents of the kindergarten students are very supportive of the activities.\n\n\"Many parents have even come to participate themselves,\" he said.\n\nIn recent years, China's aging population has continued to rise with about 249.5 million people 60 or above as of the end of last year, representing 17.9 percent of the country's total population, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.\n\nTo ensure more senior citizens spend their twilight years in comfort, China has issued a series of policies and measures to expand the supply of elderly care services, develop community-based and home-based elderly care and encourage integrated care with medical services.\n\nLocal governments have also seen achievements in the development of new ways of elderly care, including the model of kindergarten plus nursing home.\n\n\"The old can learn new things from the kindergartners and the kids can listen to interesting stories from the aged,\" Hao Baozheng said.\n\n\"Everyone will be old eventually and elderly care institutions should think more about ways to increase the sense of happiness of their senior citizens,\" he added.", "description": "YINCHUAN - Waves of children's laughter, giggles and cheers echo in the halls of a nursing home for the elderly in Yinchuan city, Ningxia Hui autonomous region.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/28/5db64600a310cf3e97a32bae.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
