Civil rights groups had recommended the city hire a third-party monitor, and officials approved the position in its latest city budget. Mr Cooke said a third-party group of national experts will determine that position\u2019s best practices as the monitor enters office.\n\nForth Worth mayor Besty Priece said the \u201centire city is in pain\u201d following the death of Ms Jefferson, who was shot through a window while she was inside her own home on Saturday morning.\n\nMayor Price apologised to Ms Jefferson\u2019s family and neighbours and said there was \u201cnothing to justify what happened\u201d.\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 October, a neighbour called a non-emergency line to request a check after he had noticed that lights were on and a front door was open at his neighbour's home, where Ms Jefferson\u2019s elderly mother lived.\n\nMs Jefferson had moved into the home to take care of her mother, who was recently moved to a hospital.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Ms Jefferson was playing a video game with her eight-year-old nephew.\n\nThe killing was captured on Mr Dean\u2019s body-worn camera, which shows his flashlight moving in the dark to the home\u2019s window before he fires.\n\nMr Dean does not identify himself to Ms Jefferson when he screams for her to \"put your hands up\" and \u201cshow me your hands\u201d. While in the middle of saying \"show me\" for the second time, he fires through the window.\n\nIn a press conference on Monday morning, family attorney Lee Merrit said police arrived on the property as if they were performing a \u201cclandestine\u201d operation, despite the neighbour's phone call never indicating that there was a threat to his life or a danger to the community.\n\nMr Merritt said: \"To escalate that situation as they entered the property, that is unacceptable.\"\n\nFollowing the shooting, the police department issued a statement that said the officer had \"perceived a threat\". Mr Merritt argues the department's officers had \"violated their training over and over again.\"\n\nMr Merritt said Ms Jefferson had opened the doors to let in a cool breeze, the first of the season following a hot summer. While playing a Call of Duty video game, she approached the window when she heard noises outside.\n\nBodycam footage provided by police ends after the shot is fired.\n\nMr Merritt said he \"would love to hear the conversation from other officers\" who were present at the scene who likely knew that what had happened was wrong. \"This a problematic police department.\"\n\nReports following the shooting said a gun was recovered inside the home. Mayor Price said \u201cthe gun is irrelevant. She was in her own home.\u201d\n\n\u201cMere words are not enough\u201d, she said. \u201cWe are taking immediate action.\u201d\n\nThe family said the department, as well as the city, can\u2019t be trusted in their ability to investigate Ms Jefferson\u2019s killing.\n\nAt least seven people have been shot by Fort Worth police since June, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.\n\n\u201cThis family is outraged and hurt\u201d, Mr Merritt said. \u201cWe ask people who are outraged to channel their anger and direct it to policymakers and substantive changes.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday night, hundreds of people gathered outside the home for a vigil honouring Ms Jefferson, a biology graduate of Xavier University who was considering enrolling in medical school.\n\nPresent at the vigil were local church and city leaders, including Mayor Price, who told reporters that she intends to hire an outside agency to investigate the shooting.\n\nThe killing follows the recent sentencing of a white police officer in Dallas who killed Botham Jean, a black man, while he was in his own apartment.\n\nIn September 2018, Amber Guyger fatally shot Mr Jean, who she claimed she mistakenly believed was in her apartment when she was on the wrong floor of the building they shared. This month, Guyger was convicted of murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison, a rare conviction among a streak of high-profile killings of African-Americans by police", "description": "The white police officer who shot and killed a black woman in Fort Worth, Texas while she was playing with her nephew inside her own home has resigned from the department and may face federal civil rights charges.", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/13/12/aj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
