Superior Court judge on Friday, often in tears, as she spoke of the \u201cawful nightmare\u201d of the five months since her father was killed while biking through the District.\n\n\u201cMy dad was supposed to be around for my birthday. He was supposed to see me graduate, go to college and walk me down the aisle at my wedding. His death has taken away my ability to enjoy any of these things,\u201d she said. \u201cNow at my house, we don\u2019t even know what toilet paper to buy, because he made those purchases.\u201d\n\nDavid Salovesh, a well-known advocate for the D.C. biking community, was killed when a man driving a stolen minivan at more than 50 mph plowed into him as he was waiting at a stoplight. On Friday, the driver, 25-year-old Robert Earl Little, was sentenced to 8\u00bd years in prison after pleading guilty in July to voluntary manslaughter.\n\nBefore issuing the sentence, Judge Craig S. Iscoe, who himself biked to court Friday morning, called the sentencing hearing \u201cone of the most painful\u201d he had ever experienced. About 100 people, including family and cycling enthusiasts, some of whom were wearing their biking paraphernalia, filled the rows in two separate courtrooms to show support for Ophelia and her mother, Jean Destefano-Salovesh.\n\nDestefano-Salovesh said she and her husband had been together for 20 years. She spoke of his love of things beyond cycling, including nature, music, hiking, baking bread, architecture, animals, history and photography.\n\n\n\nFlowers are place near 12th Street and Florida Avenue NE, where D.C. cyclist David Salovesh was stuck and killed by a stolen minivan. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cTo say that David loved life would be an understatement,\u201d Destefano-Salovesh said, her voice cracking with emotion. \u201cWe were looking forward to so much more time. But Robert Little robbed us of that and so much more. We lost feeling safe. We lost the man we could count on. My life is now without joy and a sense of needing to live.\u201d\n\nAt around 10 a.m. on April 19, according to court documents, a white Dodge Grand Caravan at Benning Road and Florida Avenue NE struck the 54-year-old Salovesh as he was resting on his bicycle waiting for the signal to change. After the impact, the van, with Salovesh attached to the vehicle, crashed into a nearby tree, pinning Salovesh, according to the documents.\n\nAuthorities say Little was fleeing police in the stolen van, but police had discontinued the pursuit by the time Little struck Salovesh. When Little was arrested, prosecutors say his blood tested positive for PCP.\n\n[D.C. man faces 8\u00bd years in prison after pleading guilty in April death of bicyclist]\n\nAt the hearing, Little\u2019s public defender, James King, said his client immediately accepted responsibility for the accident, but he said Little had not used PCP in the hours leading up to the accident. King said PCP can stay in a user\u2019s bloodstream for days or weeks after use.\n\nLittle, of Northwest Washington, turned and faced the family and said he \u201cregretted\u201d his actions. \u201cI know that is not enough and that I can\u2019t bring back your loved one. I apologize for that. I didn\u2019t intend to hurt nobody. I didn\u2019t think I would crash that car and that someone would die.\u201d\n\nSalovesh\u2019s family said in court that they had pushed back against the plea deal. They argued that anything less than 30 years was unacceptable.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Edward O\u2019Connell said the sentencing range for such an offense is between six and 10 years. O\u2019Connell said his office gave Little credit for admitting guilt early in the case, even before the preliminary hearing was held.\n\nHad Little not admitted guilt and instead gone to trial, he could have faced a maximum of 30 years in prison if convicted.\n\nRead more:\n\nA 7-year-old is the key witness against the man charged in her little brother\u2019s death.
