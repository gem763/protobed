The Times was forced to issue a correction after failing to include exculpatory evidence, like the fact that the alleged victim has no recollection of the incident... or the fact that Max Stier, a former Clinton lawyer who battled Kavanaugh during the Whitewater scandal in the 1990s, is the one pushing the allegation.\n\nOn top of everything, one of the book's authors, Robin Pogrebin, allegedly drafted and sent the vile tweet promoting the piece, an insider told POLITICO. The Times eventually deleted the tweet after receiving backlash. Their public relations and communications team said they would look into the \"decision making\" powers that lead to the tweet.\n\nI call for the Resignation of everybody at The New York Times involved in the Kavanaugh SMEAR story, and while you\u2019re at it, the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is just as phony! They\u2019ve taken the Old Grey Lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\n...She can never recover, and will never return to Greatness, under current Management. The Times is DEAD, long live The New York Times! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 16, 2019\n\nTrump has also said Kavanaugh should sue various people and news organizations for libel. According to the president, the New York Times is destroying people's lives with their \"fake news.\"", "description": "Boom..09/17/2019 4:23:12AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/196/6a144448-cd87-4760-85d0-595021c58eb5.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
