Focus on water\n\nThe first thing Susie said you should do is up your water intake first thing in the morning.\n\n'The simple act of starting each day with 300-500ml of water is one of the easiest daily rituals you can adopt to not only re-hydrate after the night's rest but to help get the digestive system moving,' Susie wrote on her blog.\n\nShe explained that water is always the best choice for slimming down, and especially ice cold water, as it's good for increasing your metabolic rate.\n\nSusie said herbal tea is another good option, and something like green tea is one of the best options - thanks to the levels of antioxidants and the gentle hit of caffeine.\n\nYou might have heard dietitians talk about how popular protein is, but making sure you get some at breakfast will help you to lose weight in the long run (pictured: eggs and avocado)\n\n2. Go for protein at breakfast\n\nYou might have heard dietitians talk about how popular protein is, but making sure you get some at breakfast will help you to lose weight in the long run.\n\n'Consuming 20-30g of high quality protein via foods such as eggs, Greek yoghurt, protein-based smoothies and higher protein bread is the easiest way to set the platform for a day of healthy eating,' Susie said.\n\nProtein not only helps to regulate your blood glucose levels through the morning, but it will also keep you full for longer.\n\nThe best things to breakfast on are scrambled eggs with vegetables, smoked salmon and avocado or peanut butter on wholegrain bread.\n\nYou might not always be told that caffeine is good for you - but in fact Susie said it can go a long way to boosting your metabolism and aiding weight loss (pictured: toast with coffee)\n\n3. Don't forget about fibre\n\nFibre is the secret ingredient all too many of us forget about with our diet, and Susie said your 'digestive system will be a lot happier' if you include some high fibre foods.\n\n'Good options at breakfast time include vegetables or sliced fruit served with your eggs; high protein, lower carb breads that are generally made with fibre rich wholegrains and seeds and a serve of bran, oats or fresh fruit which you can add to smoothies or Greek yoghurt,' Susie said.\n\nLike protein, you should be aiming for between 20 and 30 grams of fibre each day.\n\n4. Add caffeine to your diet\n\nYou might not always be told that caffeine is good for you - but in fact Susie said it can go a long way to boosting your metabolism and aiding weight loss.\n\n'Caffeine as a stimulant has been shown to increase fat metabolism, albeit in relatively small amounts but every little bit counts,' she said.\n\nTry going for a piccolo or a macchiato in the morning to give yourself a boost, and leave the milky longer coffees well alone for a svelte and sculpted physique.\n\n5. Get strict on sugar\n\nLastly, it's impossible to tone up before the summer without getting strict on sugar - and according to Susie, this is most important first thing in the morning.\n\n'The more sweet food we consume, especially early in the day, the more we are likely to want, which explains why a day that starts with banana bread and a caramel latte only seems to go downhill food-wise,' she said.\n\nDitch any processed sugars such as white bread, fruit yoghurt and muffins in the morning, and watch your diet improve as a result.\n\n'The less processed carbohydrate and sweet food we consume through the morning, the better it [our diet] will be for weight control overall,' she said.", "description": "A dietitian has revealed the five morning habits that will help you to get rid of your belly fat.
