The suit charges the decision to fire the officer was arbitrary and capricious.\n\nPantaleo\u2019s lawyers and the Police Benevolent Association had vowed to challenge the decision, arguing that Pantaleo\u2019s actions were justified and the decision was tainted by politics.\n\nThe officer was attempting to arrest Garner on Staten Island in 2014 in a struggle that was caught on video, where Garner repeatedly cried out \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d before he died.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton, who had long called for Pantaleo's termination, said the suit was an insult.\n\n\"Pantaleo's decision to seek his reinstatement is not only disrespectful to the Police Commissioner and NYPD, but also the Garner family,\" Sharpton said in a statement Wednesday night. \"He has shown no contrition or acknowledgment of his violent actions that ultimately killed Eric Garner.\"\n\nO\u2019Neill, in announcing the firing this summer, said Pantaleo could \u201cno longer effectively serve as a New York City police officer.\u201d\n\nPantaleo had been on modified duty since Garner\u2019s death, but still got pay increases and overtime.\n\nHis union and lawyer said they had been on the verge of a deal that would have let him give up his job but keep his pension, but it was pulled off the table at the last minute. They blamed the reversal on interference from Mayor Bill de Blasio, who was running for president at the time.\n\nThe PBA encouraged a work slowdown by police after the decision, leading to a drop in arrests.\n\nThe city will defend the police commissioner\u2019s decision, said Law Department spokesperson Nick Paolucci.", "description": "The suit charges the decision to fire the officer was arbitrary and capricious.", "authors": ["Erin Durkin"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b9/20/83db18a44cd2b4b1220b5c2cbc13/190716-daniel-pantaleo-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
