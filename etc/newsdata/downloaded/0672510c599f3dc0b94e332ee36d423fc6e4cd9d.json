We must remember that there are women who can't give natural birth, even if they wanted to.\"\n\nIn a recent Parent24 poll, we asked our Facebook community whether they thought birth via Caesarean is 'unnatural'?\n\nFor the majority (85%) the answer was no, while the remaining 15% disagreed.\n\nThe belief that Caesarean births are 'unnatural' or even (at the truly extreme level) an invalid form of birth is ridiculous, but some people obviously still think this.\n\nRead more here: Is birth by Caesarean' unnatural'?\n\nWhile we at Parent24 feel that there is no 'unnatural' way to bring a baby into the world, this reader perfectly explains why we need to be less critical of how mother's bear their babies.\n\nHer letter follows:\n\n'Every woman should have the right to make her own birthing choices'\n\nI feel that we, as women, are too critical of one another. We as humans should realise that everyone is different and unique.\n\nIt is unfair to place your expectations on another. We must remember that there are women who can't give natural birth, even if they wanted to.\n\nIt is just physically impossible for them. My late mother was one. Both myself and my brother were born via planned C-sections.\n\nI won't go into detail about her medical history, but if it weren't for this type of delivery me and my brother would not have been here, and my mother would have died during labour.\n\nWe had a very loving and strong relationship.\n\nI know that the rate of C-sections in SA is very high compared to other countries, but every woman should have the right to make her own birthing choices.\n\nThese choices should be informed and individualised and not influenced by the opinion of very critical people.\n\nSo, ladies, we are our own worst enemies.\n\nLet us build each other up, be understanding of our individuality and stop pressuring each other through comparison.\n\nThank you,\n\nAnonymous\n\nChat back:\n\nShare your story with us, and we could publish your mail.
