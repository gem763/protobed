This disappearing act was, in turn, an eerie repeat of the program\u2019s mysterious near-total omission from the plane\u2019s official 1,600 page manual.\n\nSo when prosecutors started digging into the mystery of why the murderous software had been omitted from so much of the official MAX literature and test requirements in early 2019, Boeing handed over the inboxes of Mark Forkner, who had spearheaded certain aspects of the plane\u2019s FAA certification and left the company in rather abrupt fashion a few months before the crashes.\n\nSeen in this context, Forkner\u2019s improbable advancement to center stage in the MCAS narrative is another smoking gun of sorts\u2014that is, once you realize the attorney he has retained to represent him in the probe, David Gerger, is world famous in white collar criminal defense for being, inter alia, the lawyer who got his client Andy Fastow, Enron\u2019s chief financial officer/debt concealment mastermind, off with a six-year sentence the same year Enron CEO Jeff Skilling got 24. The FBI has interviewed scores of former and current Boeing employees in conjunction with the various investigations into the MAX, but Forkner is the only one known to have retained a criminal attorney. In any event, once you read the chat transcript, it\u2019s abundantly clear that the guy is just about the opposite of Fastow. The chat, which occurred between Forkner and his fellow technical pilot Patrik Gustavsson, took place on November 15, 2017, and happened to coincide with the very moment both pilots learn, via someone named \u201cVince,\u201d that the MCAS software has been drastically changed from its previous iteration. That is to say, it was no longer operating only at extremely high speeds, and now existed primarily to enable the plane to properly execute military maneuvers required by the FAA\u2019s testing regime.\n\nForkner: Oh shocker alerT! MCAS is now active down to M .2 It\u2019s running rampant in the sim on me at least that\u2019s what Vince thinks is happening Gustavsson: Oh great, that means we have to update the speed trim descritption [sic] in vol 2 Forkner: so I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly) Gustavsson: it wasnt [sic] a lie, no one told us that was the case Forkner: Vince is going to get me some spreadsheet table that shows when it\u2019s supposed to kick in. why are we just now hearing about this? Gustavsson: I don\u2019t know, the test pilots have kept us out of the loop It\u2019s really only christine that is trying to work with us, but she has been too busy Forkner: they\u2019re all so damn busy, and getting pressure from the program\n\n\u201cOut of the loop\u201d was an understatement: The MCAS changes, which had the software operating at speeds as low as Mach 0.02 (or about 150 miles per hour), were just the tip of the iceberg. The change in MCAS\u2019s speed capability involved, in fact, a whole host of cascading implications that were hardly self-evident; they\u2019d all been approved nearly a year earlier, and finalized in\u2014the same month, in other words, that Forkner convinced the FAA to remove mention of the program from the flight manual. Forkner had spent the summer meeting with airlines and regulators easing anxieties about the new plane without any notion that any of this was going on. His one crime appears to have been reiterating his unknowing lie to the FAA once more in early 2017, in the process of confirming the omission of MCAS from the official flight manual. His logic was by then completely obsolesced by events: MCAS didn\u2019t need a manual entry, he argued, because it only ran \u201cwell outside the normal operating envelope\u201d of the plane. Indeed, it seems highly doubtful, given Forkner\u2019s self-professed and demonstrated inability to extract information out of his colleagues, that he had any grasp of how MCAS actually worked. That\u2019s especially the case, one can assume, since his colleagues seemed relatively committed to keeping him in the dark about the software and he was busy trying to get the simulator to calm down. Say what you will about previous corporate scandal fall guys; at least Goldman Sachs\u2019s notorious derivatives trader Fabrice Tourre basically understood how a synthetic credit default swap worked. I strongly doubt the same can be said for Mark Forkner and MCAS.\n\nMoreover, lying (especially this brand of regulatory white-lying-by-omission-of-actionable knowledge) to aviation regulators is simply part of staying employed at Boeing. Consider in this regard a recently publicized whistleblower complaint filed internally by current Boeing engineer Curtis Ewbank, who mostly discusses his attempts to equip the MAX with an additional safeguard that arguably could have prevented the crashes, also describes a separate episode in which he was assigned at one point to research in-flight 737 auto-throttle malfunctions following an inquiry from the European Union\u2019s aviation regulator. Ewbank says he was at this point directed to withhold information about the five additional malfunctions he uncovered on grounds that Boeing would \u201cfix it\u201d internally. And yet, for a sin of omission that surely seemed far more benign to someone deliberately unacquainted with the plane\u2019s engineering, Forkner appears to have been Boeing\u2019s designated in-house scapegoat\u2014at least among those who don\u2019t happen to be dead pilots.", "description": "As CEO Dennis Muilenburg faces Congress, the real scandal of late is the company's penchant for lies and callousness.", "authors": ["Maureen Tkacik"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/2031f4ea34e7caf6a83067e64b11786e310edf36.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
