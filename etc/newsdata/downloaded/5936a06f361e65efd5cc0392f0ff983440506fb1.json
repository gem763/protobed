It has since been updated and republished.]\n\nInvesting to \u201cbuy and hold\u201d is trickier than it looks. The increasing pace of technological change means even the most successful, dominant companies have to continually adapt to keep up. Industries like energy, real estate and even consumer products are facing potentially significant long-term changes going forward.\n\nIn any era, amassing a collection of retirement stocks simply by buying the best companies and holding them for years can be a risky endeavor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) was a classic \u201cwidows and orphans\u201d stock until the last decade when GM wound up going bankrupt. GM shares basically haven\u2019t moved in a quarter of a century. United States Steel (NYSE:X) once was a pillar of corporate America and a buy-and-hold stock. Polaroid and Eastman Kodak were once blue-chip stocks. Both went bankrupt as cameras changed from film to digital.\n\nBut there still are stocks to buy and hold out there that can last forever, while offering dividend income along the way.\n\nHere are ten such retirement stocks to buy and hold forever.\n\n\n\n\n\nBank of America (BAC)\n\n10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever More\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nDividend Yield: 2.56%\n\nIt might seem strange to open the list with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). After all, we\u2019re only a bit more than a decade on from the financial crisis.\n\nDuring that crisis, BofA acquisition Countrywide Financial blew up in spectacular fashion, after pioneering many of the risky tactics that led to the bubble and subsequent bust.\n\nBut this is a different BofA.\n\nNet consumer charge-offs hit a decade-long low last year. Its performance on credit metrics is strong. Government regulations have been criticized as slowing growth \u2014 but they\u2019ve undoubtedly lowered risk as well, even if observers might argue that a better balance is needed.\n\nNo less than Warren Buffett is now BofA\u2019s largest shareholder, through his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B). And the Oracle of Omaha is fond of saying that his favorite holding period is \u201cforever.\u201d\n\nThat seems likely true for BAC stock as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiageo (DEO)\n\n10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever More\n\nDividend Yield: 2.07%\n\nChange has come to the alcohol industry, with the number of breweries exploding worldwide and new distilleries popping up as well. The brands owned by Diageo (NYSE:DEO) are well-positioned to adapt to shifting tastes.\n\nDiageo owns classic brands like Johnnie Walker whiskey, Tanqueray gin, Smirnoff vodka, and Harp and Guinness beer, among many others. What most have in common is a timeless quality and worldwide brand recognition.\n\nAs a result, while beverage giants like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Anheuser Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) have struggled with earnings growth, Diageo grew net income by 13.5% in fiscal 2018 and expects consistent growth going forward.\n\nYet with a trailing multiple of 26.5, and with a dividend yield of 2%, Diageo stock isn\u2019t all that dearly valued. Long-term investors would do well to own DEO and perhaps use the dividends to buy a bottle or two of fine whisky.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedtronic (MDT)\n\n10 Buy-and-Hold Stocks to Own Forever More", "description": "[Editor's note: This story was previously published in August 2019.
