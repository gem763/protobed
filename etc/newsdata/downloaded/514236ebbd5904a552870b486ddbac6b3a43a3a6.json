The government is resolutely opposed to this because it would curtail the country's ability to negotiate free-trade deals with the likes of Australia and the US.\n\nIf these amendments get up, they would throw the Brexit process into complete disarray. A referendum would shake up the timing and political dynamics, while a legal requirement for a customs union would send the whole negotiation with the EU back to the drawing board.\n\nMomentum seems to have shifted away from either of these two proposals making it into the statute, but the situation remains fluid.\n\nIf Mr Johnson's bill passes the Commons on Thursday, it would then go to the House of Lords over the weekend for a similarly speedy debate.\n\nEU leaders are reportedly awaiting the outcome of the Tuesday votes before deciding whether, and how, to grant Britain a potential Brexit delay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Mr Johnson looks on course to get his way, they may propose a short \"technical extension\" to get the deal ratified by the British and European parliaments. If he doesn't, they may propose a longer delay in the hope that an election or referendum might clarify the way forward.\n\nA technical extension would make it impossible to hold an election this year, pushing the expected snap poll into the first quarter of next year.\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker John Bercow wouldn't allow a Brexit vote on Monday. AP\n\nThe alternative of a straight three-month delay would pave the path to a November election, in which Mr Johnson would accuse the opposition parties of having forced him to break his promise to deliver Brexit on October 31 \"come what may\".\n\nMr Johnson's latest gambit comes after the House of Commons Speaker, John Bercow, didn't allow the government to put forward a motion to approve the Brexit deal on Monday.\n\nHe said a repeat vote on the motion, following its weekend defeat, would be \"repetitive and disorderly\", as there had been no change in the circumstances surrounding the motion since it was rejected on Saturday.\n\nThe rule banning repeat votes goes back to 1604, and was invoked several times during Theresa May's tenure.\n\n\"We are disappointed that the Speaker has denied us the chance to deliver on the will of the people. The public want Brexit done,\" Mr Johnson's spokesman told the media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr Bercow was unrepentant. \"If the government have got the numbers, the government can have their way, and it's not for the Speaker to interfere,\" he told parliament.\n\nMr Johnson had hoped to get MPs to back his Brexit deal, negotiated with Brussels at the 11th hour last week, at a special parliamentary sitting on Saturday.\n\nBut a rebel Conservative MP attached an amendment to Mr Johnson's motion \u2013 which was passed by a narrow majority \u2013 which had the effect of kicking the decision into this week and forcing Mr Johnson to request a Brexit delay from the EU.\n\nMr Johnson looks close to having the numbers to pass his deal, but now just needs an opportunity to actually bring the vote to a head.\n\n[October 31] was not selected by the British public or the British government. It was ... plucked out of the air. \u2014 Ken Clarke, expelled Conservative MP\n\nThe question then is whether enough time remains before Thursday week to pass all the legislation, get the European Parliament's approval, and comply with Britain's treaty ratification processes.\n\nKen Clarke, who was the longest-serving Conservative MP in parliament until his expulsion as a europhile rebel last month, said there was no reason to cleave to the Halloween deadline.\n\n\"The date was not selected by the British public or the British government. It was a compromise selected by [French] President [Emmanuel] Macron and others and was plucked out of the air,\" he told parliament.\n\nThe continuing machinations in parliament are a setback for Mr Johnson procedurally, but in the long term could help him politically.\n\n\"Every time Boris Johnson does something most of parliament doesn't like he goes up in the polls and Labour gets dragged down,\" one astute caller told TalkRadio. \"Whatever strategy his team are going for, it seems to be working.\"", "description": "The British PM sticks to his guns as parliament thwarts him again, looking ahead to a fresh showdown on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1935%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_34/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3cfb198635ac1063bed686687fe7ea1ec430f99a", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
