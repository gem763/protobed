My parents and I stared across the room at my chemistry teacher and his wife. We smiled northern white Protestant smiles. We had nothing to say. I vowed that when I grew up, I would never settle for an awkward conversation.\n\nI was entirely wrong. Only the rude and the aggressive can blow through life without tripping into the occasional halting, awkward chat. I\u2019ve learned three ways to revive a dying conversation when you can\u2019t just leave.\n\nAsk questions\n\nI\u2019m friends with a podcast host you\u2019ve heard of. He interviews people for a living, including people who at first seem boring. But he always finds something interesting to pursue. He\u2019s like that in real life too: Whatever you\u2019re saying, he listens intently, notices any hint of something interesting, and asks about it.\n\nYou can\u2019t only use this trick, or else your conversation will start to feel like an interview. I\u2019ve been trapped in a few conversations where I was constantly answering questions, and the other person didn\u2019t give me any material to ask them something back. Between your questions, you\u2019ve got to:\n\nGive longer answers than strictly necessary\n\nAsking a new question drives a conversation forward. Adding your own thoughts lets the conversation breathe. Follow someone\u2019s answer with your own, or point out where you agree or (genially) disagree. Find a bit of a tangent to go on.\n\nA common mistake is only giving the literal answer to a question: \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \u201cRochester, upstate.\u201d You\u2019re not filling out a form, you\u2019re making conversation, so make it. \u201cActually a tiny town south of Rochester with one street light. Called Lima, like the bean. They had a lima bean festival!\u201d\n\nYou can answer a different way every time. I don\u2019t want to talk about lima beans in every conversation. Sometimes I mention the hometown bar that claims \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest urinal,\u201d sometimes I talk about my tiny K-12 Baptist school, sometimes my favourite coffeeshops in Rochester, sometimes how my neighbours were a former one-room schoolhouse and a corn field.\n\nOr I pivot to talking about San Francisco, where I lived for three formative years and miss fiercely. No one\u2019s offended that I didn\u2019t stick to the strict answer, because we\u2019re not in a courtroom, we\u2019re in a bad surf bar in Hell\u2019s Kitchen.\n\nGet ready to pivot\n\nActually, I totally whiffed the conversation in that surf bar, just last week. Four of us were talking about New York neighbourhoods, and how each one has gentrified. We\u2019d think of a neighbourhood, name a couple changes in it, agree that the city is gentrifying as a whole, and repeat. It\u2019s a common conversation in New York, and soon we ran out of steam. We forgot to prepare a pivot.\n\nA pivot is a change of topic. It isn\u2019t a leap \u2014 coming up with a new subject out of the blue. A leap is fine sometimes, but with people you don\u2019t know well, it can highlight your desperation to find a new topic. It\u2019s better to branch off of something someone previously mentioned.\n\nThat\u2019s where long answers to questions really pay off. If someone\u2019s going on for more than two sentences, you should be pocketing some detail to ask more about later, or to use as an excuse to tell a new story, outside the current scope of the conversation. That\u2019s why I like to pivot from Lima and Rochester to the more famous San Francisco, where there are a million things I could go on about. (Or have yet another chat about gentrification.)\n\nIt\u2019s better to pivot off what someone else said, rather than your own. I have a bad habit of monologuing, digressing, then picking up my various digressions. If you only pivot from things you brought up yourself, even if you give the other person a chance to talk, you can still end up too tightly controlling the direction of the conversation. So when you\u2019re looking to pivot, see if you can pivot selflessly.\n\nAlways remember: Everyone has something they can be interesting about. Small talk is only boring until you find that thing.", "description": "The pauses were excruciating. My parents and I stared across the room at my chemistry teacher and his wife.
