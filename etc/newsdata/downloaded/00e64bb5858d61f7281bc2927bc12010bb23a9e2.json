The AFL-CIO is the country\u2019s largest coalition of more than 50 major unions and represents some 12.5 million American workers, from pilots to teachers.\n\nIn his tweet, Trump claimed that union workers would not only vote for him in 2020, but should dump their unions and stop paying \u201cexorbitant\u201d fees.\n\nBut even before Trump lashed out at Trumka, labor unions have been under attack in the United States from conservative politicians and employers alike. \u201cWorking people have been thwarted\u201d in their attempts to unionize and collectively bargain, says a new report from the Economic Policy Institute (EPI).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a decades-long attack on working people,\u201d said AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Liz Shuler. \u201cIt\u2019s been a slow decline from our peak in the 70\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s been trailing off year after year primarily because of our broken labor laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a multifaceted attack because most of the people in power don\u2019t want to see working people have a slice of that power. We are the last institution left standing to bring the collective strength of working people together to fight back,\u201d she said.\n\nSince 1979, union representation of workers has dropped by more than half from 27% to under 12% in 2017. Last year, union representation was under 11%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The union declines are viewed negatively, according to a Pew Research poll. Just over half of Americans believe that the decline in union representation is bad for working people.\n\nShuler says she\u2019s encouraged, however, by the number of people taking collective action, pointing out that the majority that have joined unions in recent years are young.\n\n\u201cIn 2018, half a million people walked picket lines,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are heartened by that because workers are ready to take risks. They are tired of seeing what they\u2019re seeing in the economy, and tired of feeling powerless.\u201d\n\nAnd despite the declines, a majority of American workers would hold union elections if offered the chance. Interest in collective bargaining has remained little changed since the 70\u2019s, standing at 60%, according to the EPI report. This means that five times as many workers want to participate as are actually represented by a labor union in their office. Currently, union approval ratings are 64%, nearly a 50-year high.\n\nAnti-union activity\n\nDespite the law prohibiting employers from retaliating against workers who try to unionize, the EPI report states that more than 1 in 7 union organizers and activists are \u201cillegally fired\u201d when attempting to start a union at their place of business. But even without retaliation in the workplace, unions face an uphill battle legislatively to protect collective bargaining rights.\n\nThere are 27 states that have \u201cright-to-work\u201d laws on the books; these laws make it illegal for unions to require nonunion members to pay \u201cfair share fees\u201d to cover the basic costs of representing employees in the workplace, as fair representation laws require unions to \u201drepresent all employees \u2013 whether members of the union or not \u2013fairly, in good faith, and without discrimination.\u201d Legislation like this limits a union\u2019s ability to collect the fees they need to continue representing workers.\n\nBut Shuler said this isn\u2019t the only \u201canti-union\u201d pressure facing unions today.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the private sector bearing down on us hiring union-busting consultants. I\u2019ve witnessed captive audience meetings where they are preaching against the unions,\u201d she said.\n\nSupporters cheer as U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks at a rally hosted by the United Steel Workers and the AFL-CIO at the Statehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., April 29, 2016.

The orders limited the amount of time federal employees could spend doing union business, required agencies to negotiate union contracts in less than a year, and also required agencies to charge unions for federal space that they previously used for free.", "description": "Workers are being \"thwarted\" in their efforts for better wages, says a new EPI report.", "authors": ["Kristin Myers"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cKmTSO5i3WaCyZRTa_Cbtw--~B/aD0yMzMzO3c9MzUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b305f930-cfee-11e9-bb77-3a2fe0ccda32", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
