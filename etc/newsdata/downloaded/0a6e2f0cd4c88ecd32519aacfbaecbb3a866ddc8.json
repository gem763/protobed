We want a culture that is welcoming and allows our people to flourish, and we work hard to achieve that.\n\n\u2018We are running a firm-wide programme to ensure our values and behaviours are consistently experienced across the firm, and I am confident that we will continue to achieve change where it is needed.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
