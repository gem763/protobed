Four days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, on Jan. 24, 2017, Strzok met with Flynn in what Flynn viewed as a meeting of two colleagues, but which Strzok was using as part of a criminal probe against him, the filing said. On Dec. 1, 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements regarding his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.\n\nThe filing says that the government sat on explosive evidence about Strzok, former FBI lawyer Lisa Page and others in the bureau until the day after Flynn pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cThe day after Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea, the press exploded with the news of Strzok and Page\u2019s prolific text messages, their affair, and their malice toward President Trump,\u201d Powell\u2019s filing says. \u201cThe Inspector General issued a rare statement that he was investigating the entire matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cBruce Ohr, the fourth highest-ranking member of DOJ, was demoted,\u201d the filing continues. \u201cJudge Contreras, who accepted Mr. Flynn\u2019s plea only days before, was suddenly and inexplicably recused\u2014only for it to be disclosed much later that he was a topic of conversation in the Strzok-Page texts because he was a friend of Agent Strzok.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only did [prosecutor Brandon Van Grack] not disclose a single text message before Mr. Flynn agreed to plead guilty, but Special Counsel apparently managed to control the press on the issue until the plea was entered on December 1, 2017, in Judge Contreras\u2019s court,\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cIt defies credulity to suggest that it was only unlucky for Mr. Flynn that the story broke the very next day.\u201d\n\nInterview notes contradict later summaries, filing says\n\nThe basis for the false statements charge comes from an interview that was not audio recorded, even though anyone with a cell phone could have easily recorded it, Powell wrote.\n\nStrzok did not take any written notes during the interview with Flynn, while a junior agent did, Powell wrote. Strzok later wrote lengthy notes after the fact. Eventually, Strzok summarized the interview in a 302, the official FBI form in which an agent memorializes an interview, which became the evidence for false statements.\n\n\u201cYet, their own notes contradict the 302, [and] fail to support it at all in other ways,\u201d Powell wrote.\n\n\u201cNotes by both agents state that Mr. Flynn does not remember making four to five calls to Ambassador Kislyak from the Dominican Republic, where he was on vacation, but that if he did so, it was because phone service was poor and he kept getting dropped,\u201d Powell continued.\n\n\u201cThe final 302 states the opposite: \u2018Flynn remembered making four to five calls that day about this issue, but that the Dominican Republic was a difficult place to make a call as he kept having connectivity issues,'\u201d the filing says. \u201cThis dramatically demonstrates the wrongheadedness of allowing a 302 to create a federal felony.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo out of four of the alleged false statements in the Statement of Offense are based on what the agents claim Mr. Flynn said or did not say about the response of the Russian Ambassador on two separate issues. \u2026 The notes provide no support for a question or an answer about the Russian Ambassador\u2019s response\u2014either to the UN vote or the sanctions.\u201d\n\nEven how Strzok informed Flynn about the \u201cnature\u201d of the interview was misleading, Powell wrote. Flynn was told investigators were seeking to learn \u201cthe nature of any links between any individuals associated with the campaign and Russia,\u201d but he \u201casked no question related to election interference or coordination between the campaign and Russia.\u201d\n\nInstead, he asked what Flynn had discussed with the Russian ambassador on the issue of sanctions and a United Nations vote \u2014 when Strzok already knew exactly what he said because the conversation had been wiretapped.\n\n\u201cThe government is suppressing evidence of notes, reports, or recordings of the significant meeting the upper echelon of the FBI held to orchestrate the agents\u2019 ambush of Mr. Flynn so as to keep him \u2018relaxed,'\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThey purposely did not tell him they were investigating him and strategized at length to avoid raising any concerns. (\u2018Flynn was unguarded and clearly saw the FBI agents as allies.\u2019)\u201d\n\n\u201cSince January 2017, the government knew, but still has not disclosed the full statements and notes that show Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said the interview of Mr. Flynn was \u2018problematic,\u2019 and she was \u2018unclear\u2019 why the FBI was investigating or interviewing Mr. Flynn at all,\u201d Flynn\u2019s attorney continued. \u201cNeither Mr. Flynn nor his former counsel had any of these documents or knowledge of the plethora of information discussed above when Mr. Flynn entered his plea.\u201d\n\nMysterious British letter\n\nOn Jan. 10, 2017, BuzzFeed published the dossier compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, which alleged connections between Trump and Russia. The government also relied on the document to get a wiretap warrant on Trump associate Carter Page.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re discussing whether, now that this is out, we can use it as a pretext to go interview some people,\u201d Strzok texted.\n\nPowell wrote in her filing: \u201cIn the next two weeks, there were \u2018many meetings\u2019 between Strzok and McCabe to discuss \u2018whether to interview National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and if so, what interview strategies to use.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut in the meantime, an unclassified letter written by the United Kingdom\u2019s National Security Advisor, Sir Mark Lyall Grant, was hand delivered on Jan. 12, 2017 to the incoming national security team in New York, Powell wrote, noting that \u201c[p]rotocol dictates that it was also provided to the then active national security advisor\u2014Susan Rice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was two weeks before the pretextual interview of Mr. Flynn, and it eviscerates the credibility of Christopher Steele whose false and unverified assertions mention Mr. Flynn and were used by the FBI to obtain illegal FISA warrants that likely reached the communications of Mr. Flynn,\u201d the filing says.\n\nVan Grack, the DOJ prosecutor, \u201cknows about this letter, and he questioned people about it,\u201d it continues.\n\nLeaking\n\nOn Jan. 12, 2017, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius wrote that \u201cAccording to a senior U.S. government official, Flynn phoned Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak several times on Dec. 29, the day the Obama administration announced the expulsion of 35 Russian officials as well as other measures in retaliation for the hacking.\u201d\n\nPowell suggests that Pentagon official James Baker may have committed the felony leak, possibly with director of national intelligence Clapper telling Ignatius to \u201ctake the kill shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cBaker is believed to be the person who illegally leaked the transcript of Mr. Flynn\u2019s calls to Ignatius,\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cThe defense has requested the phone records of James Clapper to confirm his contacts with Washington Post reporter Ignatius\u2014especially on January 10, 2017, when Clapper told Ignatius in words to the effect of \u2018take the kill shot on Flynn.'\u201d\n\nFormer University of Cambridge professor Stefan Halper organized a February 2014 event at his college that Flynn attended while Halper was being paid by the Pentagon\u2019s Office of Net Assessment. That event would later become the source of unfounded rumors that Flynn and a Cambridge academic, Svetlana Lokhova, had improper contacts.\n\n\u201cFlynn has requested the records of Col. James Baker because he was Halper\u2019s \u2018handler\u2019 in the Office of Net Assessment in the Pentagon, and ONA Director Baker regularly lunched with Washington Post Reporter David Ignatius,\u201d Powell wrote.\n\nShe added that prosecutors have refused to allow Flynn\u2019s defense team to see transcripts of the calls, even though media had them.\n\nChanging 302s\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2017, media reports citing \u201csenior intelligence officials\u201d said that Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador, contrary to what Vice President Michael Pence had said on television.\n\n\u201cOvernight,\u201d the 302 was edited to add \u201can unequivocal statement that \u2018Flynn stated he did not'\u201d ask the ambassador to slow down a UN vote or vote in a certain way, Powell wrote. \u201cThis is a deceptive manipulation because, as the notes of the agents show, Mr. Flynn was not even sure he had spoken to Russia/Kislyak on this issue. He had talked to dozens of countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond, they added: \u2018or if KISLYAK described any Russian response to a request by FLYNN.\u2019 That question and answer do not appear in the notes, yet it was made into a criminal offense. The typed version of the highly unusual \u2018deliberative\u2019 302 by that date already included an entire section from whole cloth that also serves as a criminal charge in the Information and purported factual basis regarding \u2018Russia\u2019s response\u2019 to any request by Flynn. The draft also shows that the agents moved a sentence to make it seem to be an answer to a question it was not.\u201d\n\nProsecutors originally said that the 302 had been amended only to \u201cremove a header\u201d and then to remove the word \u201cDRAFT,\u201d the Powell\u2019s filing says.\n\nThe edited versions were withheld for months, and one only came out after prompting by Flynn\u2019s attorneys, Powell wrote. Prosecutors did not explain why they were not originally provided and \u201chow they suddenly turned up\u201d with \u201cmaterial differences.\u201d\n\nHiding evidence\n\nProsecutors have still not produced the original 302, Powell said.\n\n\u201cThe original 302 is not \u2018missing.\u2019 If the government will not produce it, it could only have been deliberately destroyed, and this prosecution should be dismissed on that basis alone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNeither the FBI nor its Sentinel system loses the most important of its reports that is supposed to support the federal felony of the President\u2019s National Security Advisor. The only reason for it to be suppressed is that it is favorable to the defense.\u201d\n\nPowell says that prosecutors have resisted the requirement to turn evidence over to the defense at every turn, at one point even sending a link to a Daily Caller News Foundation reporter\u2019s web page instead of turning over the official files.\n\n\u201cVan Grack \u2018produced\u2019 the first batch on March 13, 2018, by link to texts already released to the public by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He produced the second batch on June 24, 2018, by link to the \u2018Scribd account\u2019 of reporter Peter Hasson. Those cannot even be downloaded. And for his third production, it gave the defense two pages on October 4, 2018. These go precisely to the issue of McCabe\u2019s Special Counsel Lisa Page editing the Flynn 302.\u201d\n\nIn one case, prosecutors sat on records and produced them only when they realized the records were about to come out via other means, she wrote.\n\nOther potentially exculpatory evidence is being withheld from Flynn\u2019s defense team by saying it is classified, the filing says. \u201cThe government cannot conceal its wrongdoing behind a claim of classification,\u201d it says.\n\nPowell said in September that the government is hiding a slew of records that would vindicate Flynn and that prosecutors are required to turn over exculpatory evidence. Van Grack argued that prosecutors have already provided all of the information they are required to. (RELATED: Flynn Lawyer Seeks Data From Joseph Mifsud Phones That Government \u2018Recently\u2019 Obtained)\n\nIn September, a judge reversed a jury decision and acquitted Flynn\u2019s business partner Bijan Rafiekian on charges of illegally lobbying, in a case spun off from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nPowell argued for a similar result for Flynn himself.\n\n\u201cThe FBI had no factual or legal basis for a criminal investigation, nor did they have a valid basis for a counter-intelligence investigation against an American citizen, and they all knew it. The evidence the defense requests will eviscerate any factual basis for the plea and reveal conduct so outrageous\u2014if there is not enough already\u2014to mandate dismissal of this prosecution for egregious government misconduct,\u201d she wrote.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
