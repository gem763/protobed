It just doesn\u2019t work that way. Hopefully, it will all be very strong and strongly done. We\u2019re spending tremendous amounts of money,\u201d Trump told reporters gathered at the White House who attended the signing of a new trade agreement with Japan.\n\nSince the reconquest of the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria and Iraq, America has kept a small force in northern Syria, protecting its Kurdish allies, who did much of the fighting against ISIS. The Kurdish presence is an irritant to neighboring Turkey, which regards them as potential insurgents. The Kurds have long sought an independent state that would span parts of Iraq and Turkey.\n\nTrump reportedly settled on the move in a late-Sunday phone call with Turkish President Recep Erdogan, and by Monday morning there were reports that American soldiers were leaving their positions in Syria, while Turkey was launching a long-planned incursion into Syria to clear out Kurdish fighters, which analysts said could further destabilize the region.\n\nTrump told reporters there were only \u201c50 soldiers in the area you\u2019re talking about.\u201d There are reportedly about 1,000 U.S. troops in various parts of Syria altogether.\n\nTrump campaigned in part on a pledge to reduce American military commitments abroad, but his critics questioned why the effort had to begin with a token contingent that, by Trump\u2019s own description, wasn\u2019t actually engaged in combat.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the two countries that are the most disappointed that we\u2019re leaving are China and Russia, because they love that we\u2019re bogged down and just watching and spending tremendous amounts of money, instead of continuing to build our forces. We have tremendous amounts of weapons under development now. We have weapons that no one can even believe, we\u2019re going to be making some stops over the next four or five weeks, some we show, some we don\u2019t show. But we\u2019ve rebuilt our nuclear, we\u2019ve renovated and rebuilt nuclear. We\u2019re building submarines the likes of which they\u2019ve never been even thought of before, the genius of them. Hopefully and hope to God we never have to use them, but we are doing what we have to do, but we\u2019ve been there for many years, long, many, many, many years beyond what we were supposed to be. Not fighting, just there.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks before signing a trade agreement with Japan in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Monday. (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP) More\n\nTrump\u2019s withdrawal of troops from northern Syria caught many Republicans off guard, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who said the move would benefit \u201cRussia, Iran and the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nMcConnell\u2019s wife, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, attended the trade-pact signing ceremony, standing directly behind Trump as he began defending the U.S. pullout of Syria, but slowly moved out of view when a reporter asked about McConnell\u2019s stance.\n\nWhile Trump boasted that many in Washington supported his decision about Syria, few members of Congress \u2014 with the exceptions of Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla. \u2014 rushed to his defense.\n\nInstead, politicians who have routinely backed Trump throughout his presidency portrayed the decision as a betrayal of the Kurds and an inexplicable gift to Erdogan, an authoritarian leader whom Trump admires.\n\n\u201cI will do everything I can to sanction Turkey if they step one foot in northeastern Syria,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said Monday.\n\nDismissing the potential that a pullout of U.S. troops could further destabilize the region and lead to the possible slaughter of the Kurdish soldiers who have fought Islamic State radicals alongside American forces, Trump said that the Turks and the Kurds were \u201cnatural enemies.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is why the U.S. kept troops there in the first place.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump offered a defense of his plan to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HMnzAmoFm0rFT1kkL3zpIA--~B/aD0yODAxO3c9NDIwMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/a7fd73f0-e958-11e9-9ff9-bb90d2872eb9", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
