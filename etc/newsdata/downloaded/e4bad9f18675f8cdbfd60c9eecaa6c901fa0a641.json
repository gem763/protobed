But at its heart is an American-made missile that, like the Russian AK-47 rifle, has evolved into a powerful symbol of its producer\u2019s geopolitical reach.\n\nIn his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, detailed in a now-infamous whistleblower complaint, Trump appeared to guarantee the sale to Kiev of FGM-148 Javelin anti-tank missiles in return for a \u201ccorruption\u201d investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Subsequent reports revealed that Attorney General William Barr met with Ukrainian officials, as well as those from four other countries, about the origins of the FBI investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Vice President Mike Pence, too, was reportedly enlisted to tell Zelenskiy the Javelin shipments depended on a \u201cmore aggressive action on corruption,\u201d and Trump is now openly asking foreign countries to help him screw one of his political challengers to the wall, as more evidence of a clear Ukraine quid pro quo emerges by the minute.\n\nThe U.S. government is the world\u2019s most heavily-armed protection racket.\n\nBut the cretinous foreign policy practiced by the Trump administration at least helps to remind taxpayers of the way in which American foreign weapons sales have reordered presidential priorities, from the War of 1812 to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy\u201d to the Cold War and today. The Ukraine Javelin affair reflects a sad truth about American foreign policy in general, and the last half-century in particular: Strip away the soaring rhetoric of freedom and liberty, and the U.S. government is the world\u2019s most heavily-armed protection racket\u2014and by embracing foreign military sales, it\u2019s exporting Trump\u2019s fabled \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d abroad.\n\nForeign military sales have always been a fixture of U.S. history, but the development of the post-World War II military-industrial complex\u2014and the American desire to pull troops out of Vietnam while still maintaining an air of military supremacy\u2014made arms transfers a pillar of U.S. geopolitical power. The Nixon Doctrine opened the floodgates, out of conviction that the U.S. would \u201cassist in defense and development of allies and friends\u201d around the globe, but not with boots on the ground. President Richard Nixon\u2014who, like Trump, shared a penchant for secret and likely illegal foreign-policy backchannels\u2014defended arms-based partnerships to a war-weary nation by arguing that American troops \u201ccannot\u2014and will not\u2026 undertake all the defense of the free nations of the world.\u201d", "description": "How the president took his predecessors\u2019 gun-running tradition to dirty new depths.", "authors": ["Jared Keller"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/eedf4da88a87844379aeca64f1cc972945fab8b0.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
