He has delivered on his promise to give them a proposal that addresses the problem of the backstop, but that protects the interests of the entire UK.\n\nThe new deal will allow the United Kingdom to leave the EU on good and friendly terms. It meets the people\u2019s priorities \u2013 of taking back control of our money, laws and borders. It allows us to leave the customs union and the single market.\n\nAnd crucially, it protects the Irish peace process. Having recently met with some superb businesses in Belfast, to discuss Brexit readiness, I know how important it is for them to avoid friction at the border.\n\nThe offer is a compromise. It respects the integrity of the entire UK, but also of the EU\u2019s single market. Vitally, it requires democratic consent for the special arrangements in Northern Ireland and ensures flexibility for all parties to deal with the land border between the UK and the EU.\n\nWe have always been clear that we would prefer to leave the EU with a deal, with minimum disruption and with a good UK-EU relationship. This new deal offers that, while respecting the result of the referendum.\n\nThe proposal is our opportunity to strike a deal with the EU before we leave on October 31. We will now work with Brussels in the time remaining to iron out the details. We hope they come to the table in the same spirit we have \u2013 with optimism, compromise and mutual respect.\n\nIf we do get a deal at the European Council on the 17th and 18th of October, we will move at pace to get it through Parliament before October 31.\n\nIf the EU do not want to work with us, we will have to leave anyway, without a deal. But to be clear, the worst-case scenario isn\u2019t leaving the EU without a deal on October 31.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is postponing yet again, and prolonging the uncertainty, with our hands tied by Parliament. Expensive for businesses and totally frustrating for those who just want us to get on with it.\n\nDelay is what Jeremy Corbyn wants. Having voted against a deal under the last Government, he then insisted he was so in favour of a deal that he was willing to delay leaving the EU.\n\nHe hampered our negotiating efforts in doing so, yet still we found a reasonable proposal \u2013 which he now refuses to accept. In fact, Corbyn rejected the deal so quickly \u2013 before the EU or Ireland had even had time to respond \u2013 that you might ask, with good reason, whether he\u2019s actually read it!\n\nThis Government will get Brexit done so Parliament can focus on our bold domestic agenda and deliver on the people\u2019s priorities.\n\nI remain optimistic. I have spoken to many people on all sides of the House who welcomed the Prime Minister\u2019s statement and his offer to meet with colleagues and discuss the proposal.\n\nBoris Johnson has proved his detractors wrong. They chose not to take him at his word when he said he would work hard to find a deal. Now we have a proposal that the EU must engage with, he needs the backing of all MPs for the sake of the country, writes ANDREA LEADSOM\n\nBoris Johnson has proved his detractors wrong.

And an increasing number agree that this is the sensible and workable proposal that will do just that.\n\nLet\u2019s get on with it!", "description": "ANDREA LEADSOM: I hope Parliament can recognise that we are on the cusp of a breakthrough - and their backing makes all the difference.
