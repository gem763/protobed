The benchmark index is now about four percent below its all-time high in July, after coming within striking distance of it two weeks ago.\n\nA slowdown in US economic growth would remove one of the few remaining bright spots in the global economy, just as Europe appears to be flirting with recession.\n\nTuesday's dismal reading on US manufacturing fell on the heels of data showing factory activity in Germany - the powerhouse economy of Europe - also hit a ten-year low last month.\n\nGauges of manufacturing activity in Asia are also flashing red as the ongoing US-China trade war fuels business uncertainty.\n\n\"The weakening conditions in Europe and the slowdown in China, it's all adding up to the same thing essentially: worries that the global economy is slowing and giving investors reason to pause and take profits,\" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York City.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve, which cut interest rates for the second time this year in September, has indicated it would rely on economic data to determine future rate cuts.\n\nBets that the US central bank would reduce borrowing costs in October have risen to 70 percent after the ISM data, from 39.6 percent on Monday, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The Fed's next policy meeting will be held at the end of the month.\n\nOther crucial factors influencing investor sentiment this month include high-level trade negotiations between the US and China next week and third-quarter corporate earnings reports.", "description": "Stocks extend losses for a second day after report showed signs of weakness in US labour market.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/a24e5246abee4c9fb4075ac537872352_18.jpg"}
