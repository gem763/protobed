Here's ABC's Cecilia Vega now. Reporter: Facing allegations from a second whistle-blower, today, a defiant president trump blasted Democrats and their impeachment inquiry. The impeachment inquiry is a scam. Reporter: ABC news has learned the attorney who represents the original whistle-blower is now representing a second person, a member of the intelligence community who claims to have first-hand information about the president's efforts to push Ukraine to investigate his political rival, Joe Biden. The white house has released a summary of the president's phone call with the president of Ukraine.

China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened in China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine. Have you asked president XI to investigate at all? I haven't, but it's certainly something we can start thinking about. Cecilia Vega with us live tonight from the white house. And Cecilia, what does the without say about all of this?

Democrats are planning to take extraordinary steps to protect this person's identity when they meet. They're talking about about securing voice and appearance, postally having congressional aides conduct the interview without members of congress.
