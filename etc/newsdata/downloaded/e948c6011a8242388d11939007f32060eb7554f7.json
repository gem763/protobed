With just 10 seats, all at the counter, the chef prepares every dish for every guest directly, serving sushi tasting meals of 20 or more courses, which cost hundreds of dollars.\n\nNeither the lofty prices nor the highest rating from the vaunted Michelin Guide are the norm for eating sushi in Japan. But sitting at the counter in small restaurants, often in obscure or hard-to-find locations and frequently with no staff speaking English, is quite common. At better places, the option of sitting at a table and ordering simply does not exist. Often, menus do not exist either, as customers leave the choice up to the chef.\n\nForget California or Philadelphia rolls \u2013 in Japan sushi means treasured ingredients like sea urchin \u2014 Photo courtesy of Tetsuya Hanada\n\nSeeing your sushi and sashimi artfully and meticulously prepared in front of you, one piece at a time, using the freshest seasonal ingredients, is a world apart from the mixed platters and wooden boats crammed with American inventions such as California, Philadelphia or Firecracker rolls. For sushi lovers, dining this way is the pinnacle experience.\n\nBut because of high barriers to such meals, from finding a hole-in-the-wall gem to simply making a reservation to ordering from undecipherable menus and often not even knowing what is being served, many visitors instead seek out commercialized tourist-friendly restaurants and miss both a local cultural experience and education in sushi.\n\nOften, travelers claim they want to \"eat like a local,\" but in Japan that can be daunting. For those visiting Tokyo from all over the world, Sushi University is the solution.\n\nNot all sushi is raw fish, or fish at all, but at better places, it's always a beautiful art form, like this baby green onion shoot sushi \u2014 Photo courtesy of Tetsuya Hanada\n\nWhile it's a brilliant concept, the name is a bit confusing. While it's definitely a learning experience, there are no classes or homework \u2013 it\u2019s a unique twist on the local food tour.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: you make a reservation, and based on where you're staying, a \"professor\" (staffer) picks a great local gem within 30 minutes of your hotel, then meets you in your lobby and takes you there \u2013 always by subway, because owner and founder Tetsuya Hanada considers that part of the authentic Tokyo visitor experience, which like eating out, can intimidate visitors.\n\nHanada only uses sushi places with ten seats or less, where everyone sits at the counter and the meal is \"omakase,\" which means \"chef\u2019s choice,\" a multi-course tasting menu of small plates based on what\u2019s fresh and available. He contacts the chef beforehand in order to prepare a translated and annotated printed menu for you, and the same interpreter who brings you sits with you to explain the food and customs, as well as interpret as the chef addresses you just as they would a Japanese client.\n\nSushi chefs use an array of specialized, ultra-sharp knives, in this case cutting the roll into bite-sized pieces \u2014 Photo courtesy of Tetsuya Hanada\n\nIt\u2019s a learning experience and you can ask questions. It's a truly great way to dissolve cultural barriers, relax, enjoy a great meal and learn much more about sushi without intimidation.\n\nBasically, Sushi University allows visitors from all over the world (staffers speak nearly a dozen languages including English German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Korean and Thai) to dine at hidden gem omakase sushi restaurants they would never find on their own. And it does so in a way that makes them feel as if they're visiting a familiar neighborhood restaurant.\n\n\"It is a tour in which we take visitors to an Edo-style sushi restaurant along with an expert interpreter, and let them eat as the sushi chef gives a lecture,\" Hanada explained. Edo-style sushi is what Americans generally think of as simply sushi, mainly raw fish and cooked rice seasoned with vinegar, though this is just one type of Japanese sushi, which can be cooked, raw or completely unrelated to seafood.\n\nThere are three standard price tiers offered. The basic ($110) might be at the type of neighborhood eatery that office colleagues would pop into after work. The intermediate ($200) is held at a fancier venue, which a local might pick for a birthday celebration. The advanced ($290) visits a standout fine dining spot at the Michelin-starred level, but while they vary in terms of fanciness, each is a full omakase dinner of more than a dozen courses, with fifteen or sixteen common.\n\nTips for eating sushi in Japan\n\nThe finsihed product \u2013 two kinds of rolls in one fell swoop! \u2014 Photo courtesy of Tetsuya Hanada\n\nIn every single case, it's a private customized experience for your party.
