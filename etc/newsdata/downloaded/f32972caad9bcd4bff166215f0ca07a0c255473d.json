REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced on Saturday that he had canceled peace talks with the Taliban\u2019s \u201cmajor leaders\u201d at the Camp David, Maryland, presidential compound after the group claimed responsibility for a Kabul attack last week that killed a U.S. soldier and 11 other people.\n\nThe United States has recalled U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad to Washington to chart the path forward, Pompeo said in appearances on Sunday news shows. Asked on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d whether Afghan talks were dead, Pompeo said, \u201cFor the time being they are.\u201d\n\nU.S. diplomats have been talking with Taliban representatives for months about a plan to withdraw thousands of American troops in exchange for security guarantees by the Taliban.\n\nU.S. and Taliban negotiators struck a draft peace deal last week that could have led to a drawdown in U.S. troops from America\u2019s longest war, one of Trump\u2019s foreign policy objectives.\n\nAsked about the Camp David meeting scheduled for Sunday, Pompeo said Trump decided to get personally involved to get the agreement to the finish line.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump ultimately made the decision,\u201d Pompeo told Fox. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to talk to (President) Ashraf Ghani. I want to talk to these Taliban negotiators. I want to look them in the eye. I want to see if we can get to the final outcome we needed.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter news emerged of the Camp David scenario, Trump was criticized for having planned to host on U.S. soil a militant group that has killed U.S. troops and sheltered al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.\n\n\u201cNever should leaders of a terrorist organization that hasn\u2019t renounced 9/11 and continues in evil be allowed in our great country. NEVER. Full stop,\u201d U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, like Trump a Republican, said on Twitter on Saturday.\n\nAmericans will on Wednesday mark the 18th anniversary of the al Qaeda attacks that killed more than 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania.\n\nTaliban fighters, who now control more territory than at any time since 2001, launched fresh assaults over the past week, including a suicide attack in Kabul on Thursday that took the life of U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Elis A. Barreto Ortiz, 34, from Puerto Rico, bringing the number of American troops killed in Afghanistan this year to 16.\n\nPompeo said the United States will not let up on military support for Afghan troops until the Taliban take the necessary steps to show they are serious about peace.\n\nHe said more than 1,000 Taliban fighters have been killed in Afghanistan in the last 10 days alone.\n\n\u201cIf the Taliban don\u2019t behave, if they don\u2019t deliver on the commitments that they\u2019ve made to us now for weeks, and in some cases months, the president is not going to reduce the pressure, we\u2019re not going to reduce our support for the Afghan security forces that have fought so hard there in Afghanistan,\u201d Pompeo said in an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just going to withdraw because there\u2019s a timeline,\u201d he said.", "description": "Talks on bringing peace to Afghanistan are on hold and the United States will keep pressuring Taliban militants for significant commitments while providing military support to Afghan troops, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Valerie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190908&t=2&i=1427610690&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF870LS", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
