As I mentioned in that column, it is currently impossible to find \"risk-free\" bonds from developed market governments that yield even 3%, and corporate bonds are producing very skinny yields. This week saw an unprecedented - at least since 1972, when records were first kept - wave of corporate bond issuance in the U.S. Obviously CFOs are issuing this debt owing to its low cost. As Bloomberg noted this morning:\n\nFor investment-grade companies, the average yield on bonds was 2.77% as of Wednesday, according to Bloomberg Barclays index data. In late November, that figure was above 4.3%...Junk-bond yields have dropped too, with notes rated in the BB tier, the uppermost high-yield levels, paying a near record-low 4.07%.\n\nSo, those buying newly-issued fixed-income instruments are getting 3% from high-grade bonds, 4% from high-yield bonds, and would have to hold out for 30 years to get even 2% from U.S Treasuries (2.04% to be exact.) Yikes!\n\nThat 2%/3%/4% math just doesn't work, and 1.94% yield on the S&P 500 is no substitute given the idiosyncratic risks possessed by equities. Income from investments in all of these asset classes is taxable, so income investors are facing a world in which after-tax returns are de minimis. The bond markets are telling us those returns are sufficient, and I won't waste precious column space arguing about the mechanics of inflation calculations, the PCE deflator and all the other economic mumbo jumbo that constitutes \"Fed speak\".\n\nAt a certain level, those academic arguments don't matter in the face of two truths: I want higher yields. My clients demand them. Reinvestment of interest payments and the inevitable calling away of corporate securities means my Portfolio Guru asset management clients and I always have fresh capital to invest. Where to put it?\n\nI started a reference account for a new client in December. Hindsight will show that December 2018 was a really good time in recent history to initiate a portfolio of fixed income securities. While the S&P 500 flirts with 3,000, it's worth noting that there have been some sizzling performers in fixed income as well. I am looking at this portfolio (see below for full list) and saying to myself there is no way three of the 10 names should have risen more than 27% in the past nine months. While those three names are all preferred stocks, that name is quite misleading. By any economic reasoning preferreds stocks are actually bonds, and when bonds are pumping out 30% capital gains while yielding 6%-9%, you know that you are onto something.\n\nMore accurately, though, that last phrase should be \"were onto something.\" Those returns are not going to recur, and two of the securities have already been called. The 8.6% yield we locked in remains in effect, though, with the diminution from the called securities mostly offset by the benefits of compounding.\n\nBut how do we replace those lost names? The first calculus in fixed income is always price versus par. Of the remaining names in my portfolio, only four are trading above par. I will keep buying the ones that are below face value to lock in natural call protection.\n\nAlso, using screening techniques and roll-up-the-sleeves research, I have identified other preferreds that I didn't include last December. One I have been buying this week is the Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred issued by Medical Transcription and Billing Corp (MTBCP) . MTBCP is trading at a solid premium to par ($26.87 vs. $25.00 par) but is not callable until November 2020, and with an 11% coupon still yields a comfortable 10.23%. This little company from Somerset, NJ has found an attractive niche in the healthcare IT space. MTBC management has forecast a doubling of EBITDA in 2019, so I know those preferred dividends, paid monthly, are safe.\n\nSo, that's my recipe. Finding a new name, reinvesting in old names, and maximizing yields. Managing fixed income portfolios is somewhat easier than equity portfolios in that regard. If you had a high-flyer like Roku (ROKU) or any of the other red-hot tech stocks, you might be wondering if the time is right to sell. The fact that preferreds that have risen 30% since I bought them are still yielding 6%-8% in the current environment means that selling them never even crosses my mind.", "description": "My recipe: finding a new name, reinvesting in old names, and maximizing yields....MTBCP", "authors": ["Jim Collins", "Where To Put Fresh Capital In Search Of Higher Yields", "My Recipe", "Finding A New Name", "Reinvesting In Old Names", "Maximizing Yields.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Bruce Kamich", "James"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/yieldsignday.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
