They found open liquor on the bus and all of those inside were between the ages of 15 and 18.\n\nPolice said they were acting on a tip that young people were paying a fee and being permitted to drink alcohol on board.\n\nNumerous tickets were issued to the driver of the bus for infractions that included operating over the 35-person capacity, having open liquor in the vehicle, and not holding a chauffeur's licence.\n\nSgt. Ian MacLellan said the RCMP is releasing the information to make sure parents know youth may be accessing alcohol in such situations.\n\nThe B.C. government introduced stricter rules in April 2019 to beef up safety on party buses.\n\nOperators are now required to have a safety monitor on board when minors are travelling on a bus or in a limousine.\n\nThe chaperones must pass a criminal record check and have first-aid certification, including training on how to administer naloxone in case of a drug overdose.\n\nIn 2016, a 23-year-old woman died after falling out of an open door on a party bus en route from Langley, B.C., to Vancouver.", "description": "All of those inside the bus were between the ages of 15 and 18.", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5103056.1555552400!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/party-bus-rules.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
