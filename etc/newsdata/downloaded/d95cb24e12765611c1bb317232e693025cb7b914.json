AAPL, +1.23% , Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.23% and Facebook Inc. FB, +0.81% are three of more than 150 S&P 500 SPX, +0.41% companies that will report in the coming week, even more than in the crowded week before. Those three companies\u2019 large profit declines in the first half of the year put them in the top-five contributors to the earnings recession, as Apple dealt with a tough sequel to iPhone X sales, Facebook accounted for billions of dollars in government fines and Exxon suffered from a lagging chemicals business.\n\nSee also: The five companies most at fault for the earnings recession\n\nAfter last week\u2019s results, 40% of S&P 500 companies have reported calendar third-quarter earnings, and earnings for that group declined 1.66%. A big turnaround from some of the largest companies in the index could certainly turn that around, but analysts\u2019 estimates point to the earnings decline steepening.\n\nApple and Exxon are two of five Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.57% components reporting this week, and will be joined by three health-focused Dow components: Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, +1.78% on Monday, and drugmakers Pfizer Inc. PFE, +1.04% and Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -0.39% on Thursday. Plenty of big names in technology will also report this week, including Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.41% GOOG, +0.33% and chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +3.12% .\n\nHere\u2019s what to expect from the week ahead.\n\nChip shots\n\nAMD and Western Digital Corp. WDC, +2.87% could provide a bit more clarity on the semiconductor landscape, after mixed signals from chip companies that have reported earnings so far.\n\nFor more: Two struggling tech industries could demolish corporate earnings\n\nAMD\u2019s report follows a solid performance from Intel Corp. INTC, +8.10% that showed a surprise rise in data-center revenue, which the company attributed partly to $200 million in spending that was moved up in anticipation of future tariffs. While the report provided optimism initially, the one-time windfall and pessimism from other chip makers quickly tamped down any cheers for the chip sector. Investors will be watching AMD\u2019s report to gain a better read on the state of corporate spending, as well as to gauge the traction of AMD\u2019s own offerings relative to Intel\u2019s.\n\nFull preview: AMD hopes new chips helps to avoid larger chip downturn\n\nWestern Digital has seen earnings drop by more than 95% in each of the past two quarters, and analysts are calling for a 90% decrease this time around as the company continues to grapple with declines in memory prices. AMD is on the Tuesday afternoon docket, while WDC follows up a day later.\n\nA test for Apple\n\nExpectations aren\u2019t particularly high for Apple heading into the company\u2019s Wednesday afternoon earnings report, with analysts calling for roughly flat revenue relative to a year earlier. The company will be under pressure to justify a recent stock rally that keeps sending the stock to new highs, and a big focus will be Apple\u2019s December-quarter outlook, which will show how the company expects its latest iPhone line to perform in the crucial holiday season. Another area of interest will be Apple\u2019s projections for its Apple TV+ streaming service and its guidance on how to account for this service in the company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nFull preview: iPhone optimism hasn\u2019t changed Apple\u2019s downward trajectory\n\nMore iPhone indications\n\nBefore Apple delivers its numbers, carriers AT&T Inc. T, +0.24% and T-Mobile US. Inc. TMUS, +0.17% will post results on Monday morning and afternoon, respectively. Those reports will come in the shadow of Verizon Communication Inc.\u2019s VZ, -0.35% numbers, which showed strong postpaid phone additions amid a more promotional wireless environment. AT&T and T-Mobile will show if they benefited as well from this environment and could also provide some qualitative commentary on the early weeks of iPhone 11 sales.\n\nNot so slick\n\nExxon Mobil has posted two straight quarters of earnings declines, and analysts are expecting another on Friday morning when the company delivers results. Management at Exxon already put out a filing earlier in October that hinted at further disappointment as the company pointed to declines in oil prices as one factor that was expected to negatively impact earnings. Both Exxon and Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.93% will deliver full reports on Friday morning.\n\nSee also: We are in an earnings recession, and it is expected to get worse\n\nNothing but \u2019net\n\nChief Executive Mark Zuckerberg continues to face scrutiny for policy decisions at Facebook, but the company will be looking to move past some of its recent controversies with its Wednesday report. With regulatory fines in the rearview mirror, at least for now, the company is projected to post its first quarter of earnings growth since December 2018. One topic of interest on the company\u2019s earnings call will be the future of its Libra cryptocurrency efforts now that major payments players like Mastercard Inc. MA, +0.54% , PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, +2.17% , Visa Inc. V, +0.96% and others have all dropped out.\n\nSee also: Google\u2019s cloud business is sky high heading into earnings\n\nFor Alphabet, spending trends will be an area of focus as capital expenditures and operating expenditures have been rising on an absolute basis. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey\u2019s Youssef Squali sees capital expenditures starting to level off, however, while operating spending will likely keep rising. Alphabet\u2019s numbers come out on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe newbies\n\nAfter a blockbuster beginning to its time on Wall Street, Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, -0.88% shares have started to calm down, ending last week at less than half its peak price, but they are still trading for more than four times the IPO price. One of the biggest reasons for optimism is the test run of the company\u2019s meatless burgers at McDonald\u2019s Corp. MCD, -0.72% restaurants, even though that may not lead to permanent placement of the patties at McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\n\nFull preview: McDonald\u2019s trial run doesn\u2019t guarantee the meatless burger a spot on the menu\n\nOther rookies that will report this week include Lyft Inc. LYFT, +1.88% on Wednesday and Pinterest Inc. PINS, +0.35% on Thursday. On the other side of the age spectrum, General Electric Co. GE, +0.56% will report on Wednesday.\n\nA healthy slate\n\nPfizer and Merck will not be the only pharmaceutical company to report this week, after Johnson & Johnson\u2019s JNJ, +0.67% retroactive earnings cut from an opioid settlement set the sector back. Distributor McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.25% reports Wednesday morning and may provide further update on its side of the opioid settlement. Amgen Inc. AMGN, +0.00% reports Tuesday, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +1.12% and Celgene Corp. CELG, +0.66% are both on the Thursday docket, and AbbVie Inc. ABBV, -0.35% closes out the week with a Friday report.", "description": "The busiest week of earnings season is just around the corner, with a quartet of big tech names leading the way.", "authors": ["Emily Bary"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GB455_amd010_ZG_20180109204700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
