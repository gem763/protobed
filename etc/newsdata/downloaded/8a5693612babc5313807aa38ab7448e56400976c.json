He also flagged concern about the mounting Chinese debt in the South Pacific.\n\nTonga is heavily indebted to China, with more than 60% of its external debt owed to Beijing through bilateral loans, its 2019-20 budget showed.\n\nAfter Pohiva\u2019s death, his deputy, Semisi Sika, has taken over as acting prime minister.", "description": "Tonga observed a day of national mourning on Thursday for the state funeral of Prime Minister 'Akilisi Pohiva, known as a pro-democracy and climate change campaigner in the South Pacific.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431495035&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0C5", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
