ElAttrache, one of the foremost Tommy John surgeons, is the team doctor for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles Rams but hails from nearby Mount Pleasant and went to medical school at Pitt.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n[Watch live NFL games all season long for free on the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nThe 37-year-old Roethlisberger initially injured his elbow in the second half of Week 2's game against the Seattle Seahawks. He grabbed his elbow after a pair of passes and did not return for the second half.\n\nWhile the Steelers have not disclosed the extent of Roethlisberger\u2019s injury, their announcement that he would be shelved for the season paired with his second opinion from ElAttrache paints an ugly picture.\n\nSecond opinions are usually just done to be safe and are rarely different than the initial diagnosis. Roethlisberger and the Steelers have not announced when and what kind of surgery he might need, but they are certainly hoping it will not be Tommy John surgery.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the surgery is far more common in baseball than football, several notable quarterbacks have faced the procedure before. Former Carolina Panthers quarterback Jake Delhomme went under the knife after just three games in 2007 and returned for Week 1 in 2008. Carson Palmer, on the other hand, opted to let his injury heal without surgery in 2008 and was healthy for the following season.\n\nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger got a second opinion on his injured elbow.
