'The Masked Singer' is back for an even weirder Season 2", "language": "en", "text": "The Masked Singer has returned to scramble our cerebellums once again \u2014 perhaps even more so, because this season\u2019s clues are tougher than ever. But one mystery contestant who got scrambled early on was the Egg, a.k.a. Olympic skater Johnny Weir. The Egg cracked under the pressure, so to speak, and literally had (rhinestone-studded) egg on his face, when Weir became the first celebrity to be voted off the show on Wednesday\u2019s Season 2 premiere.\n\nWeir gave two vivacious performances that went over easy \u2014 his sassy Blondie cover was no yolk! \u2014 but his chances were quickly fried when he went up against the more vocally soaring Butterfly and the scary-good comic timing of the Skeleton. Well, at least the Egg won\u2019t have to be walking on eggshells trying to keep his identity a secret.\n\nThe other contestant to suffer a meltdown on night one was the Ice Cream, a.k.a superstar gamer Tyler \"Ninja\" Blevins. (The Masked Singer judges \u2014 Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger \u2014 put the show on an extreme crash diet this week, cutting out the two edible-themed contestants in one go. Food fight!) The Ice Cream\u2019s \u201cOld Town Road\u201d cover was cool, and he really served it during his sweet second performance of Devo\u2019s \u201cWhip It,\u201d but he got iced out when he went up against the Tree\u2019s Christmas sparkle and the Ladybug\u2019s spotless performance. Oh well \u2014 at least the Egg and Ice Cream (or Egg Cream, if you\u2019re into Bennifer-style name mashups) went out with perma-smiles on their polymer faces.\n\nOK, OK, apologies for all the rampant pun abuse. Obviously a show that spectacularly opens with Nick Cannon shouting, \u201cTime to get weird!\u201d as he emerges from the mouth of a wall-sized Mr. Roboto/Hanacare mask while dressed like Morris Day attending a masquerade ball isn\u2019t something to be taken too seriously. That being said, producers are not playing this season. Having realized that most of the TV-viewing public has access to Google and Wikipedia, they\u2019ve made America\u2019s most bonkers new guessing game much more challenging, with tighter \u201cmilitary-grade\u201d security and vaguer clue packages. Last season, I had already won the Yahoo office pool by Week 3, guessing every contestant correctly \u2026 but Season 2 may be my Waterloo.\n\nWhile I did figure out that the Egg was Weir from a snow-globe clue; lines about \u201cgoing for the gold,\u201d being \u201cegg-stra,\u201d and \u201cenjoying a good sparkle\u201d; and the fact that his first performance was Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cJust Dance\u201d (Weir has skated to multiple Gaga hits in the past), the Ice Cream much a much colder case.\n\nBut while there\u2019s even more this Masked Singer season to boggle the brain, there is also much, much more to dazzle the eyes. After being totally robbed at this month\u2019s Creative Arts Emmy in the Outstanding Costuming category (the one time in my life when I actually rooted against RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, which won instead), the show is back with custom costumes that make last year\u2019s outfits look like something off the Nov. 1 clearance rack at the Spirit of Halloween superstore. While eight more costumes will be unveiled next week on part two of the season premiere, I think The Masked Singer has already clinched the 2020 Emmy thanks the Aeon Flux styling of the Butterfly, the Tim Burton-does-Vegas razzle-dazzle of the Skeleton, and the magnificent Cousin It-like pile of Lisa Frank rainbow tinsel that is the Tree. (I would totally wear that Tree outfit to all my holiday parties this year, by the way.)\n\nLet\u2019s look at this week\u2019s surviving six masked mystery performers, and make our guestimates.\n\nThe Butterfly, \u201cBang Bang\u201d\n\nThe Butterfly definitely took flight and was feeling her fantasy, taking on this tricky triple-threat vocal number (\u201cThat is a singer,\u201d said Scherzinger) while flanked by Wang Chang \u201cDance Hall Days\u201d mirrorball backup dancers. \u201cFor the past year I\u2019ve been waiting patiently in my cocoon for the promise of metamorphosis,\u201d the Butterfly proclaimed, saying she\u2019s \u201cachieved success in many stages of life\u201d and has \u201cfound the courage to be reborn.\u201d A shot of Big Ben on the London skyline and a line about wanting \u201cto take back her power\u201d had me thinking the Butterfly might be a Spice Girl, though she did sound a lot like North Carolina\u2019s own Fantasia Barrino. She also declared, \u201cI\u2019m here to take you to church! Can I get an amen?\u201d", "description": "The show has returned to scramble our cerebellums once again \u2014 perhaps even more so, because this season\u2019s clues are tougher than ever.", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.MrXQR7rfCZAXUlD7pmY1Q--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/cc1fd1d0-db1e-11e9-b9cf-d8d6e4143704", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
