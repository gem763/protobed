SAP was trading about 9% higher as the market opened on Friday. In addition to the release of preliminary Q3 results that showed new cloud bookings rising 38%, it was announced that Bill McDermott is stepping down as CEO and that board members Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein are now co-CEOs.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of SAP, below, we can see the price action through Thursday and imagine the price strength today. Assuming today's early market gains hold until the close we should see SAP close back above the rising 200-day moving average line and above the still declining 50-day moving average line.\n\nA higher close and heavy trading volume today will probably turn the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line higher. A rising OBV line is a sign that traders and investors have turned into more aggressive buyers.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has narrowed slightly and gains today could move the oscillator to a cover shorts crossover. Further price strength could take the MACD indicator back above the zero line for an outright buy signal.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SAP, below, we can see that prices corrected roughly 61.8% of the rally from December. Fans of the use of Fibonacci retracements will appreciate that percentage move. The slope of the 40-week moving average line is still positive so mathematically we would favor the long side.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has corrected about three months and we have the rest of October to turn this indicator bullish.\n\nThe weekly MACD oscillator is right at the zero line but it has begun to narrow and we could see a bullish crossover in the weeks ahead.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SAP, below, we can see a potential downside price target around $103 but today's anticipated rally is not plotted. The volume by price bars (left scale) suggest that SAP is in a good area of support so a deeper decline may not materialize. A trade back up at $123.69 should turn the chart from bearish to bullish.\n\nBottom line strategy: Aggressive traders could go long SAP today on any morning intraday weakness. Risk a weak close below $113.", "description": "Let's check out the charts and indicators of this German software company....SAP", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Sap Could Rally Here So Go Long On Early Intraday Dip", "Let'S Check Out The Charts", "Indicators Of This German Software Company.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Eric Jhonsa", "Mark Sebastian", "Carolyn Boroden", "Bob Lang", "Helene Meisler"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c76a5010-ec2c-11e9-848d-5745a09a5337.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
