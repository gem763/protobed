Doing so allows Trump to try to consolidate his support as Democrats work to winnow their large field of candidates.\n\nChallengers have emerged to Trump, including former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman. Others may join them.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
