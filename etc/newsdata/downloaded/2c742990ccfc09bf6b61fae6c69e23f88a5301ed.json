At a median follow up of eight years, researchers documented 18,822 cases of lung cancer.\n\nDAD GETS WISH TO MARRY GIRLFRIEND HOURS BEFORE LUNG CANCER DEATH\n\nAfter adjusting for known risk factors \u2014 such as smoking \u2014 researchers found those who ate more yogurt and fiber had a reduced risk for developing lung cancer compared to those who didn\u2019t consume either.\n\nMore specifically, men who ate roughly three ounces of yogurt a day and women who ate about four ounces of yogurt a day had a 19 percent lower lung cancer risk compared to those who didn\u2019t eat the probiotic-rich food. Comparatively, those who consumed the most amount of fiber were 17 percent less likely to develop the disease.\n\nWhen combined, those who had the highest intakes of both had a 33 percent reduced lung cancer risk.\n\nFiber and yogurt also reduced the lung cancer risk for smokers, who were considered in the study to be the most susceptible.\n\nHOW YOU CAN GET LUNG CANCER, EVEN IF YOU DON'T SMOKE\n\n\"High consumption of fiber (prebiotics) and yogurt (probiotics) was related to a low risk of lung cancer. This association pattern was consistently seen among current, past smokers, and never smokers,\" Xiao-Ou Shu, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the study's senior author, told MedPage Today. \"In addition to the known cardiovascular benefit of fiber and yogurt intake, physicians now have additional justification to encourage their care population to increase their consumption of these two types of [a] healthy diet.\"\n\nSpeaking to The New York Times, Shu said it\u2019s not totally clear why yogurt and fiber may reduce the risk of lung cancer.\n\nHowever, \u201cinflammation plays a major role in lung cancer, and we know that the gut microbiome plays a major role in reducing inflammation. People who eat a lot of fiber and yogurt have a healthier microbiome,\" Shu said.", "description": "Eating yogurt and fiber could lower your risk of lung cancer, a new study suggests.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
