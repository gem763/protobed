This is the maxim Payton Hobart, the protagonist in Ryan Murphy\u2019s The Politician, appears to live by. Payton, you see, might be just a high school student, but he\u2019s known for a while that his life will only make sense if he manages to shape it like a highway to the highest office in the land.\n\nMost of The Politician\u2019s first season revolves around his attempt to become his high school\u2019s next class president, which he believes to be a mandatory prelude to his future (national) presidential run. In order to win, he of course needs that perfect running mate \u2013 which, in Payton\u2019s world, means someone who will make up for his flaws and provide his ticket with the personal qualities he lacks.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nHis first choice is Infinity, a student who has cancer, whom Payton and his political advisers (yes, he\u2019s a high school student with political advisers \u2014 this is a Ryan Murphy show and it would be foolish to expect anything different) think will help humanise Payton (a wealthy, white young man) to voters. But when it turns out that Infinity doesn\u2019t actually have cancer and is instead a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy on the part of her grandmother, Payton is left looking for a new running mate. That\u2019s when his team begins hesitating between Pierre Toussaint, the only Haitian student in the school, and Skye, a black lesbian who also happens to be a gifted orator.\n\nInfinity\u2019s supposed illness, Pierre\u2019s Haitian origins, and Skye\u2019s ethnicity and sexuality are clearly presented as desirable in the eyes of our aspiring teenage politicians (Pierre is repeatedly called \u201cthe Haitian vote\" \u2013 as in, he is, literally, the only Haitian vote in his school), but only through the prism of whether they will help a given candidate get elected. It's tokenism on steroids. And through this cast of characters, Murphy delivers a criticism of \u201cwoke culture\u201d \u2013 but unlike most criticisms of that sort, it\u2019s intelligent, relevant, and never unkind.\n\nHow does Murphy do it? Well, it\u2019s easy: The Politician doesn\u2019t make fun of the people craving visibility (or the people upon whom visibility is forced, such as Infinity and Pierre, who are initially reluctant to join anyone\u2019s ticket). Rather, his criticism is geared at the very people instrumentalising others for their own benefit (Payton, his initial rival River, and later on his new rival Astrid who ends up running in place of River because\u2026 well, maybe I should just let you watch the show).\n\nWokeness is a joke at Payton\u2019s high school. Its cynical treatment means it turns concerns for visibility, diversity and inclusion into nothing more than political ambition. That\u2019s why Murphy\u2019s angle works: the joke is on the right people. No one\u2019s making fun of millennials and their sense of social justice. No one\u2019s hinting at the concept of crybabies getting triggered and needing their safe spaces. No one\u2019s making fun of anyone for caring about things that actually matter.\n\nA subplot features which demonstrates the occasional pitfalls of cancel culture, when an old clip of Infinity calling a reporter a \u201cbutt-munch\u201d resurfaces. The footage, we\u2019re told, is problematic because the reporter in question is apparently \u201cobviously gay\u201d (this means he has \u201chighlights and a little saunter in his step\u201d, to quote one of Payton\u2019s advisers), meaning the word, in this context, is a slur. Everything in this storyline is absurd: Infinity\u2019s outburst, the assumption that the reporter is gay, Payton\u2019s temptation to play the \u201ceveryone has gotten a little too PC these days\u201d card in order to limit damage, and the fact that he decides to kick her off the ticket about 10 seconds after considering this possibility. At no point is it implied that it would be outrageous to let go of a potential VP if they were caught using an actual slur. Instead, it all goes back to the beating heart of the show: Payton\u2019s boundless political ambition, and how it has dissolved any chance of him ever having a real personality.\n\nEven when Skye outlines her dream presidential program, which consists of \u201ctaking a [sex discrimination] case all the way to the Supreme Court\", \"enacting a gender non-binary history curriculum\u201d, \u201cmaking every bathroom and locker room at the school unisex\u201d, and \u201cstaging a school-wide sit-in until they abolish Columbus Day\u201d, it\u2019s portrayed as ultra-liberal and progressive to the point of caricature, yet no less ridiculous than the ambitions of every other character who has vied for power since the beginning of the show. Because the truth is, history curriculums could do with a little dusting, schools have a ways to go for gender inclusivity (and inclusivity in general) \u2014 and why shouldn\u2019t a sex discrimination case be heard in the Supreme Court?\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In it, Randy Marsh kicks off a protest to cancel Columbus Day. (In real life, the holiday has been criticised due to the mistreatment of indigenous people following Columbus\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d of America.) Marsh is then revealed to have dressed up as Columbus on numerous occasions and, in order to prove his good faith, desperately wants to show that he has Native American ancestry \u2013 which in turn prompts him to French-kiss a Native American man (in order to fake having Native American DNA during a saliva swab).\n\nThe message behind this circus appears to be that those bringing up concerns against historical figures such as Columbus are no better than anyone else, so what\u2019s the point in listening to them, really? South Park has a long track record of attempting to criticise \u201cboth sides\u201d, meaning that it tries to paint progressives and conservatives as equally ridiculous. Perhaps this made sense in 1997, when the show premiered, but what good does this type of nihilism do us now? If everyone\u2019s equally bad, what\u2019s the point of anything? Why would you care? Why would you be an activist? Why would you defend your rights? (Can you see why that type of discourse isn\u2019t particularly helpful?) The Politician, while plenty cynical, manages to avoid this particular pitfall, and I for one am grateful for that.\n\nIt helps, of course, that the show itself has a diverse cast. Ben Platt, who plays Payton, is openly gay. Andrew Cashman, a student with cerebral palsy, is portrayed by Ryan J Haddad, a comedian who lives with the condition. (This contrasts with one of Murphy\u2019s best-known creations, Glee, where a paraplegic student was portrayed by an able-bodied actor.) Natasha Ofili, who is deaf, is wonderful as the school\u2019s principal. Theo Germaine, who features as Payton\u2019s campaign manager, identifies as nonbinary. In real life, Murphy has worked with Janet Mock, the first out transgender woman of colour to write and direct an episode of television for Pose, the FX drama about New York City\u2019s ballroom culture scene.\n\nDiversity, in The Politician, is as ineluctable as the laws of physics. This means that the show gets to joke about wokeness without ever sounding like a baby-boomer who left their sense of empathy in the Eighties. Showrunners, make a note of this \u2013 please and thank you.", "description": "Warning: the following piece contains mild spoilers for the first season of The Politician, but if you\u2019ve read a few stories about the series already, then there should be nothing too surprising here", "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/03/11/the-politician-s01e04-34m45s50011f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
