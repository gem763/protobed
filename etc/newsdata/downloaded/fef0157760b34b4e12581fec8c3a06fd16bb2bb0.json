I am devastated. I am angry and it's just very hurtful,' Mr Kovach told The Weekend Australian.\n\nThis isn't the first time Morris has been faced with such claims, her first book, The Tattooist of Auschwitz, also received similar complaints.\n\nThe custodians of the Auschwitz concentration camp found numerous historical inaccuracies within the book, which was based on survivor Lali Sokolov, but it still became an international best-seller, selling upwards of three million copies.\n\nThe custodians of the Auschwitz concentration camp found numerous historical inaccuracies within her first book, The Tattooist of Auschwitz, but it still became an international best-seller, selling upwards of three million copies\n\nIt was in that book that Cilka Klein made her first appearance and readers reacted so well to the character that Morris decided to centre the sequel around her.\n\nGeorge Kovach said he was approached by Morris for photographs after the book was completed after which Kovach said Morris did not seem to know much about the gulag.\n\nThe author also asked Kovach to contribute to an afterword, an offer he declined.\n\nMorris did not present Kovach with a manuscript and instead read him some excerpts which also mentioned his deceased father.\n\nCilka Klein made her first appearance in Morris' first book and readers reacted so well to the character that the author decided to centre the sequel around her\n\n'Her characterisation of my father was just offensive. He sort of seemed like \u2026 a sneaky \u00adopportunist, and that wasn't my \u00adfather at all.'\n\nNot long after, Kovach's lawyer sent a letter to Morris' publication requesting mentions of her father be removed from the book after which specific sections were omitted.\n\nBut unfortunately, his stepmother's portrayal remained unchanged.\n\nThe book was marketed as being based on a true story and relied heavily on information Morris claimed she learned from Klein's life including her supposed liberation from Auschwitz.\n\n'There's still people in Slovakia who knew my stepmother, who loved my stepmother, and for them to pick up this book that says it is a true story, and then to read about this woman who (supposedly) stole drugs in the gulag, who slept with camp commandants, it's terrible.'\n\nIn the book, Morris mentioned that Klein had been liberated by Russian forces and sentenced to multiple years in a forced labour camp for sleeping with the enemy but a letter to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany contradicted this information.\n\nIn the letter, Klein stated that she had been liberated by US forces in May 1945 at the Neustatd Glewe concentration camp and returned to Slovakia the next month.\n\nAnother alleged misinformation mentioned by Kovach's lawyer in a letter to St Martin's Press last month included the suggestion that Klein stole drugs from the gulag's hospital.\n\nThe book was marketed as being based on a true story and relied heavily on Morris claimed she learned from Klein's life including her liberation from Auschwitz which was later proven to be false\n\n'There's still people in Slovakia who knew my stepmother, who loved my stepmother, and for them to pick up this book that says it is a true story, and then to read about this woman who (supposedly) stole drugs in the gulag, who slept with camp commandants, it's terrible,' he said.\n\nMorris' publication released a statement on her behalf where she defended the author's choice of publishing the story, saying it brought to light the sexual abuse women were subjected to in World War 2.\n\n'Cilka\u2019s Journey is a work of fiction, and it is based on the memories of survivors who knew Cilka at the time these events are \u00addescribed, in particular, Lali Sokolov, the Tattooist of Auschwitz, who regarded Cilka as ''the bravest person'' he had ever met. Heather Morris chose to tell Cilka\u2019s story because it highlights the sexual abuse that women suffered during World War II and its aftermath, abuse that has gone unacknowledged for too long,' the statement read.", "description": "An Australian author is under fire for allegedly misinterpreting the experiences of a Holocaust survivor in her latest book.", "authors": ["Mahnaz Angury For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/11/19330068-0-image-a-20_1570271186093.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
