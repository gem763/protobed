But they will get a lot less in sale price using these services than they would going the traditional route. (iStock)\n\nNew real estate transaction models have captured the attention of many buyers and sellers recently, including the introduction of \u201ciBuyers,\u201d which provide nearly instantaneous offers for homes online based on a computerized \u201cautomated valuation model.\u201d\n\nMost iBuyers are either start-up real estate companies such as Offerpad or Opendoor, operating strictly as iBuyers, or may be a bolt-on product offering from large websites with huge traffic such as Zillow Offers and Redfin Now.\n\nThe iBuyers service operates in a variety of markets, but it does not yet have a large presence in the Washington area. Primary markets for these companies are places such as Phoenix, Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, Orlando and Tampa, where there are many relatively new homes in large planned unit developments (PUDs) and where the housing is all similar, making estimating the value of a home much simpler. The iBuyers have also been favoring housing built in the past 20 to 30 years, and those cities have all experienced a growth spurt in the past two or three decades.\n\n[More Coile: First-time home buyer? Here\u2019s how to boost your competitive position in the market.]\n\nBesides the uniqueness of its housing stock, the D.C. housing market has a very limited number of homes for sale. In August, the number of active listings dropped by 20 percent to 7,743 homes, according to data from Bright MLS. While much of the rest of the country saw inventory begin to increase earlier this year, in the D.C. region inventory has declined year-over-year since mid-2016. August\u2019s 20 percent decline was the largest decline since June 2013, and August 2019 inventory is less than half of the peak level of inventory in August 2010.\n\nAnother indication of the tight inventory is that homeowners in the region received an average of 98.6 percent of their original asking price when they sold their home. In Arlington County, Va., sellers received an average of 99.9 percent of their original listing price. Arlington is the site of Amazon\u2019s new HQ2 and, as a result, has seen its housing prices soar. (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)\n\nFor homeowners who want to sell their property on a specific date because of relocation or because they\u2019re timing the sale to match the completion of a new home, an iBuyer option may seem enticing. Other sellers who don\u2019t want to make repairs or who want to avoid the hassle of open houses and buyer visits may also be interested in this service.\n\n[More Coile: Just because it\u2019s a sellers\u2019 market doesn\u2019t mean you should overprice your home]\n\nTypically, sellers enter basic information about their property on an iBuyer site and receive an offer based on the site\u2019s algorithms, which will be reconfirmed after an inspection of the property. The sellers can accept or reject the offer, which is likely to be lower than the amount they would be offered if they fully marketed the property. For some sellers, that lower offer is worth the convenience of certainty of the sale and not having to improve the appearance of their home, show the property and negotiate the terms of the sale.\n\nAfter the purchase, the iBuyer will usually repair the house and sell it for a profit.\n\nAn iBuyer transaction consists of two sales: one from the homeowner to the iBuyer and the second from the iBuyer to the new homeowner. While iBuyer purchase transactions bypass the MLS system since the property doesn\u2019t get listed on the open market before the iBuyer takes it, housing market data provided by the MLS helps buyers, sellers and even iBuyers evaluate current market values. Price and inventory trends tracked by the MLS influence how much sellers will be offered for their home from an iBuyer or a traditional buyer. When the iBuyer has completed their fix-up and is ready to sell, most are utilizing a professional agent and the MLS to sell their properties in the shortest time for the best price.\n\nThe iBuyer service will find its place in the market, but it won\u2019t be an acceptable solution for most sellers. Avoiding the minor inconveniences of going through a traditional sales process will not be worth the lost equity for most sellers.\n\nJon Coile, chairman of Rockville-based multiple-listing service Bright MLS (formerly MRIS), writes occasional commentary on the Washington area housing market.", "description": "The service will find its place in the market, but it won\u2019t be an acceptable solution for most sellers.
