The good news is that there are plenty of highly ranked schools to fit any preference.\n\nSmall colleges say their tightknit communities give undergraduates special attention. More classes are taught by actual professors, not graduate students, and more people will know your name.\n\nExplore the Full Rankings VIEW Interactive You can filter the WSJ/THE full rankings or customize them to focus on your own priorities.\n\nLarge colleges trumpet the vast resources, facilities and connections that come with an undergraduate enrollment in the tens of thousands. \u201cIt\u2019s true, you\u2019ll take a lot of classes at Berkeley with grad students and 500- to 600-person lectures, but you also get to take classes with Nobel Prize winners, Oscar winners, Pulitzer Prize winners,\u201d says Bob Jacobsen, dean of undergraduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, which has about 30,000 undergraduates and is ranked No. 34 overall in the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education College Rankings.\n\n(You can sort the complete rankings by a variety of measures and reweight the main contributing factors to reflect what\u2019s most important to you. Or you can compare two colleges here.)\n\nIn these rankings, the 100 largest colleges rank higher on average than the 100 smallest schools. But within the top tier of colleges, the split among sizes is almost even: The top 100 colleges overall include 33 small schools, defined as having undergraduate enrollments of 3,000 or less; 35 midsize schools, with enrollments between 3,001 and 10,000, and 32 large schools, with enrollments above 10,000.\n\nBoth larger and smaller schools have tried to overcome the negatives associated with their respective sizes. For instance, some smaller schools have found success by building a niche for themselves. Claremont McKenna College, with about 1,400 undergraduate students, emphasizes topics like government and finance emphasizes topics like government and finance while giving students access to a broad range of courses through the other schools in the Claremont Colleges consortium.. The school is ranked No. 38 overall.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have 35 academic departments, we basically have 10 academic departments and they\u2019re all exceptional,\u201d says Dianna Graves, dean of students at Claremont McKenna.\n\nIn addition, one way extra attention paid to undergraduates at smaller schools can manifest itself is in higher graduation rates. Small schools scored 11% higher than large schools on average in the WSJ/THE rankings\u2019 measure of graduation rates.\n\nFinding a Fit The top-ranked colleges by undergraduate enrollment size Small (up to 3,000 students) California Institute of Technology (No. 5 overall) Amherst College (20) Williams College (21) Pomona College (23) Wellesley College (24) Swarthmore College (28) Middlebury College (35) Claremont McKenna College (38) Haverford College (39) Carleton College (40) Midsize (3,001 to 10,000 students) Harvard University (No. 1 overall) Mass. Institute of Technology (2) Yale University (3) Princeton University (5) Brown University (7) Stanford University (7) Duke University (10) Northwestern University (11) Dartmouth College (12) Johns Hopkins University (12) Large (more than 10,000 students) University of Pennsylvania (No. 4 overall) Cornell University (9) University of Southern California (18) University of California, Los Angeles (25) University of Michigan\u2013Ann Arbor (27) New York University (31) Univ. of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (33) University of California, Berkeley (34) University of California, Davis (36) University of California, San Diego (37)\n\nSome small, private colleges across the country struggle financially. Steve Sammons, vice president for strategic initiatives at Corban University, which is ranked below 600 overall and enrolls about 1,000 undergraduates, says funding \u201cdoes become monumentally more difficult when you drop in enrollment below a 1,200 line.\u201d But some high-profile, highly rated small schools, especially in the Northeast, have substantial funding. And large colleges are overwhelmingly public schools, which have their own financial challenges due to the limitations of government funding. Among the top 50 schools for resources, a measure that accounts for 30% of the overall WSJ/THE ranking, 14 are small and only five are large.\n\nAttracting recruiters to campus can also be a challenge for small schools. Marci Linson, dean of admissions at the College of the Ozarks, ranked below 400 overall, says it\u2019s hard to compete with schools that can offer tens of thousands of undergraduates to recruiters. \u201cAt a small school like ours you have a liberal-arts focus, so you may not have those name-brand large corporations knocking on the door every day,\u201d says Dr. Linson.\n\nMeanwhile, large colleges are brainstorming better ways to manage their students\u2019 personal needs on a massive scale. The University of Central Florida, ranked 311th overall, uses a computer system to study trends in academic data in an effort to identify students in need of academic support or a change in degree track. With more than 48,000 undergraduates, the university has the largest enrollment of any school in the WSJ/THE rankings, a size that isn\u2019t for everyone\u2014like the size of the smallest school in the rankings, Clarke University, with fewer than 800 students.\n\n\u201cThis comes down to what feels right for the student,\u201d says Thad Seymour Jr., interim president of UCF.\n\nMr. O\u2019Daly is a Wall Street Journal reporter.
