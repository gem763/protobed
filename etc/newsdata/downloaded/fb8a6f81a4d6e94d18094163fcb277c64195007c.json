Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez officially announced her backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders for president on Saturday, calling him an inspiration for her own grassroots campaign.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, lauded as a superstar among progressives, received a raucous reception from the crowd in Queensbridge Park as she outlined her working class upbringing and the effect of Sanders\u2019s 2016 primary campaign. She decried the atmosphere in Congress, arguing that there is a push within its halls to get legislators to abandon the working class.\n\n\u201cIt wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Ocasio-Cortez, talking about her previous job as a bartender, \u201cthat I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education and a living wage.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez introduced Sanders as her \u201ctio\u201d (uncle in Spanish) and he emerged to AC/DC\u2019s \u201cBack in Black.\u201d The New York legislator was the last in a long series of speakers tasked with giving their official stamp of approval Sanders, who is recovering from a recent heart attack. Critics have called into question the vitality of his campaign, once again bringing the touchy question of age and fitness to the center of the primary debate. Yet, supporters at the Queens based rally, lined up in rows shaking \u201cBernie 2020\u201d signs as signed-songwriter MAX serenaded the crowd, remained unflinching to their candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you Bernie\u2019s back,\u201d Sanders\u2019s wife, Jane, said among \u201cBernie\u201d chants from the crowd, \"and he is healthy and he\u2019s more than ready to continue his life long struggle to fight for the working people of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell what about his health?\u201d asked liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, criticizing the media coverage of Sanders. \u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet? That\u2019s the health I care about. What about the health of the kids in Flint, Michigan? Talk about that on cable news.\u201d\n\nMoore added: \u201cThe only heart attack we should be talking about is the one Wall Street is going to have when Bernie Sanders is president of the United States.\u201d\n\nRep.

On Tuesday night, Sanders was in the middle of a vigorous debate performance when multiple outlets began to report the news that Ocasio-Cortez was set to endorse him. Minutes after the debate, Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota announced that she had endorsed Sanders, giving the campaign a boost from two congresswomen of color under the age of 40.\n\n\u201cPeople supporting him is a huge thing,\u201d said Sarah Heidtmann of Rocky Point, N.Y. \u201cThere\u2019s a media narrative of \u2018Bernie Bro\u2019 culture. Ocasio-Cortez endorsing him \u2026 breaks that narrative that people of color, women don\u2019t support him.\u201d\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Sanders are both self-described democratic socialists. Ocasio-Cortez, who now represents parts of Queens and the Bronx, was an organizer for Sanders\u2019s run for the Democratic nomination in 2016 before launching her own insurgent campaign for the House in 2018. Her district is also near the country\u2019s largest public housing development, the state\u2019s dirtiest power plant and the site where Amazon was set to build its HQ2 until pushback from activists and some local leaders, including Ocasio-Cortez, caused the company to pull out of the deal.\n\nOcasio-Cortez reportedly called Sanders while he was in a Nevada hospital recovering from his heart attack to let him know she planned to endorse him. It remains to be seen if the endorsement will have a major effect on the primary, but Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s five and a half million Twitter followers are more than former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the current frontrunners in the race. Among Democrats with an opinion on both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, the former is more popular among women voters, white voters and the wealthiest voters, potentially giving the senator a bump.", "description": "At a rally in Queens, Rep.
