The trailer of the film was unveiled yesterday and it has managed to evoke reactions from many.\n\nMaddock Films\n\nJust to give you an idea of what Bala is, the trailer starts with Bala selling skin -whitening products in a school where he encounters a dusky girl played by Bhumi Pednekar. Bhumi who gets offended by Bala's comments asks him why he is wearing a cap. She then inches closer and takes the cap off, leaving Bala's semi-bald head in the open.\n\nThe trailer then shows the constant struggle Bala undergoes to regain hair where he also seeks help from his father played by Saurabh Shukla who tries home remedies to correct his son's baldness.\n\nAt one point in time, the premature balding of Bala also proves to be a hindrance in his marriage.\n\nDepressed by his situation, Bala runs pillar to post to find a solution for his baldness. After trying a lot of weird concoctions to add length to his hair, he decides to put on a wig to impress his lady love in the film.\n\nDon't Miss 163 SHARES 43.8 K SHARES 22.6 K SHARES 22.1 K SHARES 16.5 K SHARES\n\nThe film has landed into a casting controversy and people don't seem too convinced with the fact that they cast Bhumi and then used makeup to make her look darker than she is. Pointing out the hypocrisy of the film industry, here's how people reacted:\n\nif only there were any actors in this country with darker skin... if only.#BrownFace #Bala pic.twitter.com/baks9OaeFw \u2014 Karnika (@KarnikaKohli) October 10, 2019\n\nWhy is Bhumi Pednekar's face covered in soot? \u2014 Anantika Mehra (@AnantikaMehra) October 10, 2019\n\nSo Bala is about a man who suffers from hair loss, who is played by Ayushman, and a dark skinned girl who gets mocked because of that. However, instead of maybe hiring a real dark skinned actress they just cast Bhumi and further darken her face. Ironic, to say the least \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/IH9ImpPbyq \u2014 lost soul (@theClaiire) October 10, 2019\n\nDear bsdk Bollywood,\n\nWhy did you have to paint bhumi\u2019s face brown, Is there lack of brown girls in India!?
