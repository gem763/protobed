Many thought their connection will long last, but the latest in the task has made them part their ways but still, they pretend that they have a connection. Now it\u2019s real or fake, you decide.\n\nTwitter\n\nBut Paras' girlfriend Akanksha Puri, who is outside the house, is convinced that his connection is not real with Shehnaaz and he is just playing his game as per the show demands.\n\nTwitter\n\nIndiatimes got in touch with Akanksha Puri and spoke to her about her thoughts about boyfriend Paras' connection with Shehnaaz and his fake story of their breakup in the house.\n\nDon't Miss 972 SHARES 275 SHARES 8.1 K SHARES 219 SHARES 41.5 K SHARES\n\nFirstly we asked if she was pinched about the connection of Paras with Shehnaaz in the first week itself, to which she very calmly said,\n\n\u201cI was frankly aware of it and plus the way they were promoting the show, it is about connections, the one who makes more connections goes to the finale. This is the whole concept this time.\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nEven when Paras was about to leave the show, he told me this will be my game plan. He said, 'I will try to make as many connections as possible and that will take me to the end.' He was quite clear about his portrayal. I was quite aware and nothing came as a surprise to me.\u201d She added.\n\nTalking about Shehnaaz, she said. \u201cShe was the easiest one to make the connection with, I was sure because when I saw the first episode, I thought she will have connection with him, because she is somebody who comes across very easy and also she was all over him and it was very easy for Paras to target Shehnaaz, I was pretty cool about it.\u201d\n\nWhen we quizzed about how Paras said that he's broken up with her and even called her a psycho, she laughed off and said,\n\n\u201c Yes I heard that, I know that was shocking, but everybody knows about our relationship, we are very open about it. We have a very strong connection and there is no way that people will believe him, to make his story. I knew he will play a card like that, he even told me that be prepared that I might say anything, so don\u2019t cry about it\u201d.\n\nTwitter\n\nShe further claimed, \u201cHe has a tattoo of my name, people know us as a couple, so how will he convince them we ain\u2019t together, I am sure he didn\u2019t have any other card to play than this. Other than that nothing would look convincing, I guess even I would do the same thing if I would be at his place.\u201d\n\nTalking about his connection with Mahira and Shehnaaz, she added,\n\n\u201cI really love his connection with Mahira because that looks real, because Shehnaaz definitely she is playing, she knows what is selling for her. She also knows the game. If I get a chance, I will give a wake up call to Paras to play his game, and don\u2019t teach others your game so much that they start playing better than you and that is what Shehnaaz is doing.\n\nTwitter\n\n\"Mahira is a smart girl and she is maintaining her dignity. But Shehnaaz I have seen today she is in a blanket with Paras then the other day with Siddharth. I have seen her body language and which as a girl personally I don\u2019t like. You have to maintain your dignity. You cannot look so desperate and easy on national TV. People who are trolling Paras, I want to tell them please go and see how Shehnaaz is looking as a girl. She is looking very bad, desperate and very easy, I know you have to do such things, but play your other cards as well, I don\u2019t find her stable. But at the same time, she is entertaining and you can\u2019t deny that fact also.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was really liking Mahira and Paras' connection and I thought they will go a long way, but when she came in eviction with Rashami, we all are sure now who\u2019s going\u201d.\n\nTwitter\n\nWhen asked if Sidharth Shukla is a threat to Paras in the house and she said,\n\n\u201cSidharth is not a threat, but we can\u2019t deny the fact that he is the strongest contender of Bigg Boss right now. The way he is playing the game is very well, and I am sure Sidharth will go till the end. Paras and Sidharth are completely different personalities and they both are playing good. So let the audience decide whom they want to watch more.\u201c\n\nWhen asked if she would like to enter the Bigg Boss house, she said,\n\n\u201cIf I get a chance I will visit the house, but I am not going as a wild card because that is not possible as I have a show right now and I am the lead, plus it will spoil the game for Paras and it\u2019s a not a couple show, I would love to visit the house as I\u2019m missing him, I want to go and hug him and meet him\u201d.\n\nTwitter\n\nClearly, Paras is the strongest contender in the house and has become everyone\u2019s favourite.", "description": "Ever since Bigg Boss 13 has started everyone is talking about Paras Chhabbra and his connection with Shehnaaz Gill.
