Truly heartbroken,\u201d Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the founding chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, told CNN. Chaffetz called Cummings \u201can exceptional man.\u201d \u201cHe loved our country,\u201d tweeted the former Oversight Committee chairman, who jousted with Cummings when the Democrat was the panel\u2019s ranking member. \u201cI will miss him and always cherish our friendship.\u201d The House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, hailed Cummings as \u201ca leader for both parties to emulate.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy, of course, to find a kind word for the deceased\u2014even Trump, who just a few months ago called Cummings\u2019s Baltimore congressional district a \u201cdisgusting rat and rodent infested mess,\u201d lauded him as a \u201chighly respected political leader\u201d in a tweet this morning.\n\nRead: What Elijah Cummings once told Trump in private\n\nYet by all accounts, the reactions from Republicans on Capitol Hill were no crocodile tears, and Cummings had genuine personal relationships with several of them. Cummings himself described Meadows as \u201cone of my best friends,\u201d and came to his defense after Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan accused the Trump ally of pulling a \u201cracist\u201d stunt at the Cohen hearing.\n\nPerhaps no tribute\u2014from a Democrat or a Republican\u2014was as reverential as that of Gowdy, who said Cummings was \u201cone of the most powerful, beautiful, and compelling voices in American politics.\n\n\u201cWe never had a cross word outside of a committee room,\u201d Gowdy, another former GOP chairman of the Oversight Committee, said in a lengthy Twitter thread this morning. \u201cHe had a unique ability to separate the personal from the work.\u201d He recalled a story Cummings often told of a school employee who urged him to abandon his dream of becoming a lawyer and opt for a job \u201cwith his hands not his mind.\u201d That employee would later become Cummings\u2019s first client, Gowdy wrote.\n\n\u201cWe live in an age where we see people on television a couple of times and we think we know them and what they are about,\u201d the Republican said.\n\nCummings died at a Maryland hospice center from what his office said were \u201ccomplications concerning longstanding health challenges.\u201d He had spent months in the hospital after heart and knee surgeries in 2017 and got around in a wheelchair, but there was little public indication of how serious his condition was in the weeks before his death.\n\nIn Baltimore, Cummings\u2019s legacy will extend far beyond his work on the House\u2019s chief investigatory committee. He was first elected to Congress in 1996, after 13 years in the Maryland state legislature. After the death of Freddie Gray in the back of a police van in 2015, Cummings walked through West Baltimore with a bullhorn in an attempt to quell the unrest from angry and distraught black citizens. In March 2017, at a time when most Democrats were denouncing the Trump administration on an hourly basis, Cummings met with the new president at the White House in a bid to work with him on a bill to lower drug prices. As my colleague Peter Nicholas recounted earlier this year, the two men fell into a candid talk about race, but little came of the effort on prescription drugs.", "description": "The story of the veteran lawmaker is one more example of how, in Washington, appearances deceive, and public performances and private relationships often diverge.", "authors": ["Russell Berman"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS146VX/facebook.jpg?1571325920", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
