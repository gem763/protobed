Now that they\u2019ve released a feature film, Mister America, all I want is to tell people why they should watch this completely bonkers show.\n\nIn On Cinema At The Cinema, Tim Heidecker plays Tim Heidecker, a vain, selfish, and violent man who has absolutely no interest in movies and yet hosts a show where watching them is the point. Gregg Turkington, who also does stand-up under the name Neil Hamburger, plays Gregg Turkington, a man who loves literally every movie to the point that he has collected hundreds of VHS tapes and calls it a \u201cfilm archive.\u201d\n\nWhat begins as a more straightforward satire of shallow movie criticism becomes a show where Tim Heidecker becomes addicted to a bootleg vape system that he later sells to people at a makeshift music festival, with disastrous results.\n\nThe core of On Cinema\u2019s comedy is that Gregg and Tim clearly hate each other. Each time Tim interrupts the movie reviews to introduce increasingly bizarre business ventures\u2014natural medicine, the aforementioned vapes, his band Dekkar\u2014Gregg seethes under his hat, angrily eating popcorn. Frequently, Tim can\u2019t pronounce the titles of the movies or the actors in them. Often, Tim clearly hasn\u2019t even seen the movie, which only infuriates Gregg more.\n\nIn a recent episode, Tim claimed that De Niro played the clown prince of crime in Joker rather than Jaoquin Phoenix, which he pronounced \u201cJack-o-ween.\u201d If you\u2019re looking for anything resembling an actual opinion about a movie, you\u2019re out of luck. They give every movie five bags of popcorn, the highest rating on their scale.\n\nThe kind of storytelling that occurs in On Cinema between the movie reviews is incredible. Each season follows Tim\u2019s attempts to use the show to get rich and famous, wildly overestimating the appeal and importance of his internet movie review show in the process. As hateable as Tim is in this show, there\u2019s something hypnotising about his lack of self awareness.\n\nHis character is the embodiment of a mediocre white guy that\u2019s been given millions of chances just because of his relative privilege. That Tim has said that people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to vote until they watch Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2019s Hilary\u2019s America should not come as a surprise.\n\nThere\u2019s also something weirdly comforting in watching two people who don\u2019t know anything about movies talk about movies. While Gregg is the show\u2019s nominal film expert, he doesn\u2019t have a sense of taste. He just likes every movie. When he\u2019s given a chance to talk about a VHS from his archive, a lot of the time he\u2019ll just say how long the movie is rather than give any details about its filmmaking or plot. In a recent interview with The Film Stage, Turkington described the show as \u201ccontemptful\u201d towards modern cinema.\n\n\u201cIt feels to me like this whole industry is geared towards these big babies, you know? Kind of like, if you\u2019re ever in an airport at 6 in the morning and you see all these guys\u2014successful, older executives; business travellers\u2014and what do they have for breakfast? A giant chocolate-chip cookie with M&M\u2019s in it,\u201d Turkington said.\n\n\u201cIt just really kind of stinks. You should have options for children and for people looking for escapism, but so much of this stuff, it really feels like it\u2019s geared towards literal big babies.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s comforting to know that other people out there see that much of modern cinema has become banal and that certain types of people can get away with literal murder if they yell loud enough. The Tim and Gregg of On Cinema are buffoons, and in context of a ramshackle movie review show, I get to laugh at them rather than lament their ever-encroaching power over my life as a consumer and movie lover.", "description": "When I was first introduced to On Cinema At The Cinema, a bizarre comedic movie review show starring Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington, I didn\u2019t quite realise how cultish the fanbase for it was.
