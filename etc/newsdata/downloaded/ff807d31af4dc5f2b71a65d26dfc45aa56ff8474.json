Authorities said the investigation continues, but there was no apparent link to domestic or international terrorism.\n\n\u201cThere are no definitive answers as to motive or reasons at this point, but we are fairly certain that the subject did act alone,\u201d Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said at a news conference.\n\nGerke said seven victims were killed and 22 wounded, and he offered his condolences to their families.\n\n\u201cMy heart aches for them all,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the wounded was a 17-month-old girl, Anderson Davis, who was shot in the face, according to officials and an online fundraising campaign started by her family.\n\nThree police officers were shot and wounded - one from Midland, one from Odessa and a Department of Public Safety state trooper - and were in stable condition.\n\nAn FBI agent investigates the home of Seth Ator following the shooting he committed, according to the local police, in Odessa, Texas, U.S. September 1, 2019. REUTERS/Callaghan O'Hare\n\nIn a statement on Facebook, Odessa police named the gunman as Seth Aaron Ator, 36, of Odessa.\n\nOnline court records showed Ator had convictions in 2002 for criminal trespass and evading arrest. The Midland Reporter-Telegram newspaper quoted a state lawmaker, Rep. Tom Craddick, as saying he had previously failed a background check.\n\nOn Aug. 3, a gunman from the Dallas area killed 22 people in another Saturday shooting at a Walmart store about 255 miles (410 km) west of Midland in the city of El Paso, Texas.\n\nPresident Donald Trump called the Odessa-Midland shooter \u201ca very sick person,\u201d but said background checks on gun buyers would not have prevented recent U.S. gun violence.\n\nIn remarks to reporters on Sunday, Trump said he would be working with Democrats and Republicans on gun legislation when Congress returns this month. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to see some interesting things coming along,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bloodshed between Midland and Odessa began when two state troopers pulled over a car on Interstate 20 for not using its turn signal and the lone occupant fired at their patrol vehicle with an \u201cAR-type\u201d rifle, or lightweight semi-automatic, wounding one of them.\n\nAfter fleeing, the suspect hijacked a postal van and opened fire on passersby before being shot dead outside the Cinergy cinema complex in Odessa, police said.\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbot praised first responders and medical personnel, and told reporters that the hurt felt by the victims was \u201cincalculable.\u201d\n\nAnd he read a text message he received from the wounded toddler\u2019s mother, thanking everyone for their prayers.\n\nSlideshow (15 Images)\n\n\u201cI have been to too many of these events,\u201d Abbot said, reciting the shootings in Dallas, Sutherland Springs, Santa Fe High School and El Paso that have happened since he became governor in 2015.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken by the crying of the people of the state of Texas. I\u2019m tired of the dying of the people of the state of Texas ... the status quo in Texas is unacceptable, and action is needed,\u201d Abbot said.", "description": "A gunman who went on the rampage with an AR-type rifle in West Texas killed seven people and wounded 22 others, including a toddler who was shot in the face, before he was killed by police, authorities said on Sunday.", "authors": ["Keith Coffman", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425249359&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8104F"}
