United about playing perhaps half of its home schedule next year at the 20,000-capacity MLS stadium. Negotiations are ongoing.\n\nAddressing season ticket holders after the game, Spirit owner Steve Baldwin was asked, \u201cHow many games at Audi?\u201d\n\nHis reply: \u201cAudi Field is a very special venue, and this is a very special venue. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nWhile SoccerPlex would be the natural choice to host the remaining matches \u2014 and continue to serve as team headquarters \u2014 United has suggested Segra Field, a 5,000-seat spot in Leesburg.\n\nUnited owns Audi Field and Segra Field, which opened last month for D.C.'s second-division team, Loudoun United. It is the centerpiece of a planned soccer campus that will include training fields for the men\u2019s pro teams and, perhaps in the future, the Spirit.\n\nLike SoccerPlex, Segra Field is located well beyond the Beltway. Unlike SoccerPlex, the playing surface is artificial turf.\n\nBoth sides acknowledged they are talking but declined to publicly share specifics.\n\nSoccerPlex has been the Spirit\u2019s home since the NWSL launched in 2013. Before that, the Washington Freedom women\u2019s team played there for three seasons.\n\nWhile the Spirit\u2019s future home remains unsettled, SoccerPlex on Saturday provided a lively atmosphere after consecutive appearances at Audi Field. Attendance was 5,200, almost 1,800 more than the Spirit was averaging at SoccerPlex before this weekend.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nicer when there are [18,000], 19,000 giving you a lift, but when you\u2019ve got a packed house here, it\u2019s the same impact on the players,\u201d Spirit Coach Richie Burke said. \u201cHere or there, it\u2019s nice to have the support behind us.\u201d\n\nAs for choosing between Audi Field and SoccerPlex, goalkeeper Aubrey Bledsoe said: \u201cI want to play in front of the biggest crowd possible, so I would say Audi. But at this stadium, the pitch is incredible. Of course, we want to fill up the biggest venue possible.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s starters included five U.S. World Cup players: Lavelle, Pugh and North Carolina\u2019s Crystal Dunn, Abby Dahlkemper and Jessica McDonald. And the outcome preserved \u2014 for at least one more day, anyway \u2014 the playoff hopes of the Spirit (8-8-6), which will close the season at Orlando and Portland and need help to claim the fourth and final spot. The result also ended a six-game winning streak by the defending champion Courage (14-5-4).\n\nUnder heavy pressure from the start, Washington almost made it to halftime without conceding a goal. Defender Paige Nielsen made a terrific goal-line clearance.\n\nBut deep into stoppage time, the Spirit lost track of Courage leading scorer Lynn Williams, who met McDonald\u2019s cross for an easy one-timer.\n\nThe Courage\u2019s dominance continued in the second half as several shots hit the crossbar or posts. It had big advantages on shots (25-6) and corner kicks (11-1).\n\nThe Spirit, though, gained traction in the late stages.\n\nIn the 75th minute, substitute Bayley Feist nudged the ball wide to Pugh, who skipped an angled shot past Stephanie Labb\u00e9 for her second goal of the season.\n\nLavelle, who recently returned from a month-long absence caused by a head injury, struggled most of the match. But in the 84th minute, she beat a defender at the top of the box and ripped a low shot with her left foot to the far corner for her first goal.\n\n\u201cRose is a special player,\" Burke said, \"and in special moments of a game, special players pop up and do their job.\u201d\n\nFar post, will you take this \ud83c\udf39?@roselavelle knows how to score in big games.\n\n\n\n2-1 | #WASvNC pic.twitter.com/PlxWKaXj1d \u2014 NWSL (@NWSL) September 29, 2019\n\nLavelle has played sparingly for the Spirit because of injuries and national team duty.\n\n\u201cI was glad to be able to help the team win,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been kind of upset because I haven\u2019t been able to give everything to the Spirit this season.\u201d\n\nAdded Bledsoe: \u201cThat million-dollar left foot got us the win tonight.\u201d\n\nRead more on soccer:\n\nD.C.
