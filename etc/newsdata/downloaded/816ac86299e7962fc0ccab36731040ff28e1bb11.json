This is fundamental to fruitful artistic practice.\u201d\n\nNg Ka-lok, a SCAD Hong Kong student taking a bachelor of fine arts in painting, initially worked in the family business before taking the chance to follow a true calling.\n\n\u201cSCAD has provided me with a great faculty and role models, as well as a deep understanding of the fundamentals. I\u2019m developing my personal style thanks to the professional support and facilities to pursue my dreams.\u201d\n\nStudents also have the opportunity to present their pieces through SCAD\u2019s own full-service art consultancy, which offers tailor-made design and curatorial services.\n\nPieces are made available through scadartsales.com which shows work from more than 45,000 emerging artists and well-known names to a global clientele.\n\nFurthermore, SCAD students and alumni have had unique opportunities to exhibit their work at world-renowned museums, including the Guggenheim and Art Central Hong Kong. They have also been showcased on popular television shows such as Empire and Star.\n\nWith a growing appreciation of art and new demand to convert public areas into exhibition spaces, Hong Kong is taking centre stage in the art world and SCAD is helping creative young talents realise their potential.\n\nEdited by John Cremer\n\nCourses of study are registered with the Hong Kong Education Bureau, registration numbers: 261958-261971, 262196-262202 and 262909.
