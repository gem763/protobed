That price was lower than the $9.99 monthly fee that some analysts and reports had expected before the event, and it makes Apple\u2019s offering cheaper than streaming services from Netflix Inc. NFLX, -2.16% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, -2.19% .\n\nLive blog recap: Apple unveils new iPhone 11 models, $4.99 price for streaming services\n\nThe pricing announcement pressured shares of Netflix, Disney, and especially Roku Inc. ROKU, -10.49%, which saw its stock fall more than 10% in Tuesday trading. Apple shares ended the day up 1.2%.\n\nApple plans to launch the TV+ service in November with shows including \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d with Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston and \u201cSee\u201d with Jason Momoa. The company plans to add new programming on a monthly basis. Users who purchase a new iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod Touch, or Apple TV will receive a year of the service for free.\n\nRead: What sets the Apple credit card apart? It wasn\u2019t created by a bank, company says\n\nThe company will be sticking with the $4.99 monthly price for its coming Arcade videogame service as well, which wasn\u2019t as much of a shock. That offering will be available on Sept. 19.\n\nApple stuck with its three-device approach to its new iPhone lineup, rolling out a trio of devices in the iPhone 11 family featuring Apple\u2019s A13 chip, which Apple says is the fastest ever to be in a smartphone. The cheapest of these three devices, the iPhone 11, has a dual-camera design that supports ultrawide shots and night-mode capabilities for low-light situations. The front-facing camera allows users to take slow-motion selfies, which Apple calls \u201cslofies.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Apple\u2019s iPhone 11 design is getting people worked up in all the wrong ways\n\nThe iPhone 11 comes in six colors \u2014 white, black, red, yellow, green and purple \u2014 and has an hour more of battery life than the iPhone XR. Apple plans to offer the iPhone 11 for a starting price of $699, below the $749 it charged for the XR, its predecessor, at launch a year ago. The $699 price came in below what analysts had been expecting before the announcement. Apple will also be keeping the XR in stock, lowering the price of that device to $599 in a bid to make its offerings more affordable, and will offer discounts for certain trade-ins.\n\nIn a note after the event Tuesday, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives called the price tag on the iPhone 11 \u201ca clear indicator Apple is laser-focused on sparking further demand in the all-important China region.\u201d\n\nThe company made a big show of discussing how its iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max devices are the first of its smartphones to earn the \u201cPro\u201d distinction, and these items remain in thousand-dollar territory. The iPhone 11 Pro begins at $999, like the iPhone XS did a year ago, while the iPhone 11 Pro Max starts at $1,099. The devices have better battery life than their predecessors, with the iPhone 11 Pro packing four hours more than the XS and the iPhone 11 Pro Max adding five hours more than the XS Max, according to Apple.\n\nRead: Before you buy Apple\u2019s iPhone 11, here\u2019s the true cost over your lifetime\n\nBoth phones feature a triple-lens camera setup that includes a telephoto lens.

The watch comes in aluminum, stainless steel, ceramic and new titanium casing options, and users will be able to pick their preferred band and case configurations when they purchase the device. With prior models, Apple limited shoppers to a set list of band configurations for the initial purchase and let users shop for additional colors of bands separately.\n\nThe Series 5 devices will feature an always-on display, with the GPS version starting at $399 and the cellular version beginning at $499.
