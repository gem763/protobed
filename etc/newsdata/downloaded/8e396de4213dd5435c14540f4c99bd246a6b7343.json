It also shows that President Donald Trump lives rent-free in their heads and that it drives them totally insane. Another thing that\u2019s also quite clear, and it\u2019s been this way for quite some time, is that MSNBC is just there to give progressives their daily fix. They\u2019re meant to keep liberals from jumping off cliffs. That\u2019s it. it\u2019s the only way to explain host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell\u2019s atrocious judgment in going to air with a story that only had one source and so shoddy that he was forced to apologize (sort of) for it. Even The Washington Post couldn\u2019t defend it, with media writer Eric Wemple taking the liberal pundit to the woodshed, asking whether O\u2019Donnell was fit to host a program on the network:\n\nThere\u2019s a two-word phrase that will stick with MSNBC host Lawrence O\u2019Donnell for some time, if not his entire career. He invoked it over and over on his Tuesday night program in reference to Donald Trump\u2019s dealings with Deutsche Bank. \u201cI may have some information in this next hour which would add a great deal to their understanding of that, if true, and I\u2019ll be discussing it here in the beginning of the show,\u201d said O\u2019Donnell at the outset of his opinion program, during the handoff from colleague Rachel Maddow. He went to the wishing well again: \u201cI want to get your reaction to what it could mean, if true, and I stress if true because this is a single source.\u201d [\u2026] Actually, no: The key words of the opening discussion were the uncorroborated, wish-fulfillment garbage that O\u2019Donnell presented to his viewers: Namely, that according to his \u201csingle source,\u201d loan documents from Deutsche Bank involving Trump \u201cshow that he has co-signers. That`s how he was able to obtain those loans. And that the co-signers are Russian oligarchs.\u201d John Heilemann, an MSNBC national affairs analyst, regurgitated the cautionary phrase of the moment and then proclaimed how big a story this could be: \u201cGot to stress if true, but if true, the reporting that you have \u2026 it\u2019s the skeleton key, right, that opens \u2014 picks the lock on so many fundamental mysteries of the Trump era.\u201d [\u2026] Capacious and loving First Amendment protections, though, do nothing to mitigate the failings of O\u2019Donnell. With his repeated \u201cif true\u201d caveats, O\u2019Donnell was mocking the core idea of journalism \u2014 which is to say, the verification of stray tips and rumors. Reporters and TV hosts mess up all the time, broadcasting scoops that turn out to be flimsy or just plain untrue. The mistakes stem from poor execution, misunderstandings, uncooperative subjects, stupidity, groupthink \u2014 and any number of other considerations that fall short of warranting disciplinary action. Here, the catastrophe appears to flow from one man\u2019s conclusion that having Russian oligarchs on Trump loan documents is a story that\u2019s too good to check. When we asked an MSNBC spokesperson whether O\u2019Donnell did indeed check with someone in the Trump orbit before his report, we received another decline-to-comment response. Is such a fellow fit to host an MSNBC program?\n\nLast night I made an error in judgment by reporting an item about the president\u2019s finances that didn\u2019t go through our rigorous verification and standards process. I shouldn\u2019t have reported it and I was wrong to discuss it on the air. I will address the issue on my show tonight. \u2014 Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) August 28, 2019\n\nIf we\u2019re going by the times when the media actually held their own people accountable, the answer is no. In December of 2017, ABC News\u2019 Brian Ross took to air a shoddy Trump-Russia story, reporting that Michael Flynn, who would later be appointed Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, was ordered by then-candidate to make contact with the Russians. That was not true. This was done after Trump had won the election, part of your routine diplomatic groundwork building that\u2019s done with any incoming administration. Ross\u2019s report tanked the markets. Ross was suspended for four weeks and eventually, Ross parted ways with the network in 2018. Also, in 2017, CNN, another anti-Trump outfit, published a shoddy Scaramucci-Russia story. Heads rolled there; three reporters were forced to resign (via Politico):\n\nThree CNN staffers have resigned following the publication and subsequent retraction of a story linking a Trump transition team member to the Russia-related investigations. The piece, published late last week, cited an anonymous source saying the Senate Intelligence Committee was looking into the chief executive of a $10-billion Russian investment fund who met with financier Anthony Scaramucci before the inauguration. The report also said that two Democratic senators wanted to know whether Scaramucci had indicated in the meeting whether sanctions against Russia would be lifted, a decision that could impact the investment fund. Out are: The reporter, Pulitzer-Prize nominee Thomas Frank; assistant managing editor Eric Lichtblau (who recently joined from the New York Times and is a Pulitzer winner himself); and Lex Haris, the executive editor in charge of investigations. \"In the aftermath of the retraction of a story published on CNN.com, CNN has accepted the resignations of the employees involved in the story's publication,\" CNN said in a statement.\n\nStop the hammering for a second, O\u2019Donnell. You stepped on a rake. This was avoidable.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:14:11AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2011/118/33e28df5-e482-4763-99ed-4dafa2a7af4b@news.ap.org.jpg"}
