Barr said he directed the DOJ and the FBI to \u201crefine\u201d their ability to stop mass shooters before they attack.\n\n\u201cWhile we are cognizant that irrational acts of violence by lone actors are very challenging to prevent in every instance, quiet professionals in the Department have a strong record of swift action in meeting these threats, though many of our successes receive little public attention,\u201d Barr wrote.\n\nBarr\u2019s letter came 2 1/2 months after a right-wing gunman killed nearly two dozen people inside an El Paso, Texas, Walmart. HuffPost found that, in the four weeks after the El Paso shooting, local and federal law enforcement authorities arrested more than 40 people in connection with mass shooting threats.\n\nEarlier this year, a top FBI official told reporters that domestic terrorism was a \u201cchallenging\u201d problem for the bureau. Because domestic terrorists have killed more people in recent years than those associated with foreign terrorist organizations like the Islamic State, some have suggested that Congress pass a domestic terrorism law, which some civil liberties advocates say is unnecessary. (Not all mass shootings would necessarily qualify as acts of domestic terrorism.)\n\nDays before the El Paso attack, FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers that the bureau had logged more than 100 domestic terrorism-related arrests in the first three quarters of the 2019 fiscal year. Wray said that a \u201cmajority\u201d of the domestic terrorism cases investigated by the bureau \u201care motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence.\u201d\n\nRead Barr\u2019s letter below.", "description": "The attorney general said the FBI will host a training session as officials work to \u201cidentify, assess and engage potential mass shooters before they stri...", "authors": ["Senior Justice Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db061272100009628ad3ad8.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
