However, an e-euro would be good for Europe\u2019s financial system, particularly in the wake of economic globalization.\n\n\u201cSuch a payment system would be good for the [European] financial center and its integration into the world financial system,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cWe should not leave the field to China, Russia, the U.S. or any private providers.\u201d\n\nRelated: Now Traders Can Make Bets on When Facebook\u2019s Libra Will Launch\n\nEchoing other European leaders, such as French finance minister Bruno Le Maire who said France would block Libra, Scholz argued that the power of currency issuance should reside in the hands of the state, saying:\n\n\u201cA core element of state sovereignty is the publication of a currency, we will not leave it to private companies.\u201d\n\nSome U.S. lawmakers agree, with the head of the U.S. House of Representative Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters (D-CA) previously calling for Facebook to delay Libra\u2019s launch until regulatory approval was received. The House Committee is still pressuring Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress on the matter before January 2020.\n\nMembers of the Libra Association, slated to sign a formal charter sometime this quarter, have been feeling the effects of such criticism. Financial service firm PayPal announced its decision to leave the association last week, citing the need to work on its own mission.\n\nRelated: UK Finance Watchdog\u2019s Crypto Investigations Up By 74% in 2019\n\nOlaf Scholz image via Shutterstock\n\nRelated Stories", "description": "Speaking on a possible e-euro, minister Olaf Scholz said Germany \"should not leave the field to China, Russia, the U.S. or any private providers.\"", "authors": ["William Foxley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KtmFEhU5uUPyTVEIN_BKkg--~B/aD05MDg7dz0xNTAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/coindesk_75/49ffd615e3cddb0f1b24b90f93b0cf77", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
