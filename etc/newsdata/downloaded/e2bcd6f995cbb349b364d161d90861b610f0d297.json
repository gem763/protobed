In his written judgment, McCloskey said: \"I consider the characterisation of the subject matter of these proceedings as inherently and unmistakably political to be beyond plausible dispute.\"\n\n\"Virtually all of the assembled evidence belongs to the world of politics, both national and supra-national.\"\n\nOne of the applicants is high-profile victims\u2019 campaigner Raymond McCord, whose son was murdered by loyalist paramilitaries in 1997.\n\nThe ruling comes a day after two of the U.K.'s highest courts issued contradictory rulings Wednesday on Johnson's decision to suspend parliament. The Supreme Court is to hear appeals to both cases next Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking today during a visit to a lighthouse tender, Johnson denied having lied to the Queen Elizabeth II over the suspension of parliament, following a judgment delivered yesterday by judges at the Scottish court of session. They argued that prorogation was \u201cmotivated by the improper purpose of stymying parliament\u201d rather than \u2014 as the government claims \u2014 to bring forward a fresh legislative agenda. Johnson said such claims were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d true.", "description": "Judge rules that the matter of the case is \u2018unmistakably political.\u2019", "authors": ["Cristina Gallardo"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-618769728-1-1200x628.jpg"}
