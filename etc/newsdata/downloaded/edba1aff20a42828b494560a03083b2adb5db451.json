The company calls itself YogaWorks, according to its website, because yoga works for every body. But that inclusive message, employees say, doesn\u2019t extend to the company\u2019s labor practices \u2014 and in order for it to live up to its lofty ideals, it must change. Now they\u2019re ready to force it to try. Citing low pay, irregular scheduling, and inadequate benefits, they\u2019ve organized the first union of yoga instructors in the country.\n\n\u201cYoga teachers, by my calculation, are in New York City and other places are earning under what\u2019s considered the poverty line,\u201d said one woman, who supports the union and asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. \u201cI\u2019m sure that students, if they knew that, would be shocked.\u201d\n\nOn Monday morning, around 100 teachers from the chain\u2019s four New York City locations asked management to recognize a union with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. They filed a petition for an election with the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday. Organizers stress that their issues aren\u2019t just YogaWorks-specific, and are also endemic to the industry as a whole: Teachers are typically independent contractors, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation and precariousness, and usually paid per class, which means they have to piece together multiple gigs in order to make ends meet.\n\nThough YogaWorks classifies teachers as employees, which entitles them to certain rights and benefits \u2014 a rarity for the industry \u2014 many say it\u2019s difficult to qualify for the company\u2019s health insurance. To do so, teachers have to lead at least ten classes per week, but for most, the standard is prohibitively onerous. No one interviewed by the Cut currently has insurance through YogaWorks. \u201cYou\u2019re in the wellness industry, your job is about health, and yet your own health is not supported or guaranteed in any way,\u201d said the anonymous woman.\n\nOther instructors spoke of the lack of a clear path for career advancement and frustrations around pay raises. The woman said she\u2019d heard of an employee who had worked for the company for 17 years and never received a raise. To get one at all, she added, teachers typically have to force the conversation, and that\u2019s not always easy.\n\n\u201cI fortunately knew the process of advocating for myself, but a lot of other teachers, specifically newer teachers, were really struggling with the process and weren\u2019t sure how they how they could get a raise or insurance,\u201d Jess Blake, who\u2019s worked for the company since 2011, told the Cut. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s almost impossible for them to get what they needed in their lives through yoga.\u201d\n\nLow pay and professional instability can block anyone who isn\u2019t financially comfortable from entering the field, and teachers believe these barriers disproportionately burden women of color. Toya Williford, who teaches part-time for YogaWorks, told New York that she believes that teachers are \u201cvastly underpaid and undervalued, especially within the YogaWorks structure.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019m an African-American woman and I have found very few women of color in the industry.\u201d\n\nYogaWorks employees initially brought their concerns to company management, in conversations that were \u201cprofessional and great,\u201d according to Markella Los, who\u2019s been teaching for YogaWorks for two-and-a-half years. But unionization, she added, looked like the best way to permanently improve conditions. YogaWorks, meanwhile, isn\u2019t thrilled by its place in labor history. In an email to staff, reported by the New York Times, a regional vice-president for the company urged employees not to sign union cards. \u201cYogaWorks does not believe that employees joining \u2014 and paying dues to \u2014 a union is in the best interest of YogaWorks, our employees or our students,\u201d Heather Eary wrote.\n\nTo the YogaWorks teachers, unionizing sends a message to the entire industry. \u201cWhat we want to see is a higher bar, a higher standard, for how teachers are treated across the board,\u201d Blake explained.\n\nThat ambition pits the YogaWorks union directly against industry trends. It\u2019s a conflict with broader significance: For many members of this mostly female workforce, yoga is foremost a spiritual practice, grounded in principles of non-violence and communal well-being. But as it gained popularity in the U.S., corporations took interest and sought to turn it into a product. The two philosophies already have little in common with each other, and as private investors seek to make more and more profit off the ancient spiritual discipline, their differences could become irreconcilable.\n\nYogaWorks exemplifies much of the change that affects the industry overall. Since its 1987 founding by two Los Angeles\u2013area yoga teachers, it has become a national chain with around 60 locations, and has changed corporate hands twice. It\u2019s currently owned by Great Hill Partners, the same private-equity firm that bought Gizmodo Media Group earlier this year. And it\u2019s not the only yoga chain with a link to private equity \u2014 as the New York Times reported earlier this year, TSG Consumer Partners bought another, larger yoga chain, CorePower, in March.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to guess why private equity\u2019s is so interested in yoga: Wellness is incredibly lucrative. A 2016 study produced jointly by Yoga Journal and the Yoga Alliance found that Americans spent around $16.8 billion a year on classes and products. But those profits aren\u2019t being equally shared, teachers say; in the same Yoga Alliance study, only 29 percent of teachers described yoga as their primary source of income. And in 2019, over a thousand CorePower teachers sued the chain, citing the amount of off-hours work that goes into preparing a yoga class, and saying that they\u2019re paid less than minimum wage. (CorePower vigorously denied that claim to the Times.)\n\nWilliford and others hope the union will help them carve out new stability in a precarious industry \u2014 a goal that recently attained new significance, as the future of YogaWorks looks somewhat uncertain. In June, it removed itself from the New York Stock Exchange. Its revenue had \u201cdecreased by 6.7 percent\u201d during the last quarter, Club Industry reported in August, plus \u201ca quarterly loss of 19 cents per share.\u201d To curb expenses, it closed several yoga studios.\n\nTeachers began their organizing drive months before YogaWorks stopped publicly trading, but the company\u2019s turmoil only seems to have reinforced their commitment to a union. It\u2019s a question of wellness, after all \u2014 their own, and that of teachers to come. \u201cI feel like our effort at YogaWorks to unionize teachers makes it seem that we do matter. Like our voices matter, and that the profession needs to have more support,\u201d Blake said.\n\nStay in touch.
