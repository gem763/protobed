I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s such a disaster, but will they lose a primary?\n\n\u201cThey need to get a grip, and when they see things that are not right they need to say something about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause our foreign policy is in shambles right now in my humble judgment, and I see things happening that are hard to understand.\u201d\n\nMr. Powell cited a recent controversy surrounding Mr. Trump reportedly circling Alabama with a Sharpie marker on a projection map for Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\u201cIn my time, one of us would have gone to the president and said, \u2018Mr. President, you screwed up, so we\u2019ve got to fix it and we\u2019ll put out a correction,\u2019\u201d Mr. Powell said. \u201cYou know what they did this time? They ordered the Commerce Department to go out and back up whatever the president mis-said.\n\n\u201cThis is not the way the country\u2019s supposed to run, and Congress is one of the institutions that should be doing something about this,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe media has a role to play. We all have a role to play. We\u2019ve got to remember that all of these pieces are a part of our government: Executive branch, Congress, Supreme Court and the Fourth Estate. We\u2019ve got to remember that the Constitution started with, \u2018We the People,\u2019 not \u2018Me the President.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Mr. Powell has criticized Mr. Trump. In 2016, he called the then-candidate a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and an \u201cinternational pariah\u201d in a hacked email to a former aide that leaked online.\n\nMr. Powell, who served as secretary of state under Republican President George W. Bush, said he still considers himself a \u201cmoderate Republican\u201d who wants the U.S. to have a strong foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe have to look out for our people, and we ought to work hard to making sure we\u2019re one country and one team,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so, on that basis, I call myself a Republican.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
