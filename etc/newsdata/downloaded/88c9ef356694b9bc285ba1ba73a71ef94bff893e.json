Sri Lanka\u2019s team is now leading with 1-0 in the series.\n\nPeople lost hope as Sri Lankan bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Isuru Udana dismissed three top-order batsmen in the match. Then, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Iftikhar Ahmed tried to save the sinking ship. But, who knew that they will also become a part of the sinking ship?\n\nThe duo scored 46 runs before they made a hilarious mistake. Sarfaraz was playing and Iftikhar was on the other side, but it was like Iftikhar was not at all interested in scoring runs. So both of them ended up at the striker's end!\n\nHere is the picture of the incident:\n\nThis is so #Pakistan !! I don't even see such run outs in school cricket !! I wonder how they repeatedly do it with such precision !! #PAKvSL pic.twitter.com/NN41wc1WQK \u2014 Mikkhail Vaswani (@MikkhailVaswani) October 5, 2019\n\nPeople were both amazed and amused at what happened on the field.\n\n1.\n\nHere is the footage of that inzi-youhana runout vs india at sharjah,2000.

Inzi & Yousuf were run out similarly vs India at Sharjah. Robin Singh ran both of them out infact on both ends. Eventually inzi walked back as he left the crease first. \u2014 Anurag Sinha (@anuragsinha1992) October 5, 2019\n\n6.\n\nSri Lanka beat Pakistan by 64 runs in 1st T20I. Not only batting and bowling, Pakistan's running between the wicket was also fantastic \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23 #PAKvSL #PAKvsSL pic.twitter.com/a41LjzP5Wn \u2014 Sir Jadeja fan (@SirJadeja) October 5, 2019\n\n7.\n\nIPL 2019 also witnessed some exceptional moments on the field, and these include some very funny ones. During the Rajasthan Royals vs Delhi Capitals clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Monday, Stuart Binny came running into the field but missed the ball.\n\nAfter Binny\u2019s miss-field, Ben Stokes chased after the ball and slid in to make a pick-up and throw but that also didn\u2019t work out and the ball slipped out of his hand. Stokes sported a sheepish smile after the incident.\n\nWatch the video of the incident here:", "description": "Pakistan suffered a 64 run defeat in the first T20I of the 3-match series against Sri Lanka as they failed to chase the target of 166 runs.
