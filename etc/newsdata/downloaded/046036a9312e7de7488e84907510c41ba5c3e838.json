And, please select Hindu delivery person. All ratings will be based on this.'\n\nHeights of stupidity! Hindu man from #Hyderabad orders Chicken 65 from Grand Bawarchi, owned by a Muslim, but abuses Muslim delivery boy of @swiggy_in for the order being less spicy. @amjedmbt asks Swiggy to register case against Ajay Kumar. pic.twitter.com/suB0djnsLw \u2014 krishnamurthy (@krishna0302) October 23, 2019\n\nBut when Ajay received a call from a delivery boy named Suleman, he lost the plot. He went on to hurl abuses against the delivery boy when he received a call enquiring about his exact location of delivery.\n\nAfter the controversy Amzadullah Khan president of a political party Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT), expressed shock saying,\u201cHow can the food be rejected based on religion?\n\nAn HT report states that Ajay, while speaking to the Swiggy customer care said that he doesn't mind losing the Rs 95 as cancellation fee but he would never accept an order from a Muslim man.\n\nSwiggy has not yet reacted to this incident.\n\nIn a similar incident in July, a man named Amit Shukla in Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh cancelled his order as \u201cthey allocated a non Hindu rider\u201d for his delivery.\n\nDeepinder Goyal, the founder of the food delivery platform added \"We are proud of the idea of India - and the diversity of our esteemed customers and partners. We aren\u2019t sorry to lose any business that comes in the way of our values.\"\n\nBringing food into the religious dynamics is utterly ridiculous, unfortunately there are some people who will just never learn!", "description": "This nauseating religious stigma persists and this time a Swiggy customer has done it again.
