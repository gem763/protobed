He was convicted of drug conspiracy, weapons charges and lying to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).\n\nThe former Honduran congressman, according to United States prosecutors, relied on 'state sponsored drug trafficking' enabled by Honduras President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nExplosive testimony included a witness revealing that El Chapo gave the Central American leader $1 million ahead of the 2013 presidential campaign in return for favorable treatment.\n\nTony' Hern\u00e1ndez is expected to be sentenced January 17, and could face from five years to life in prison.\n\nHis attorney promised to appeal the decision.\n\nJuan Antonio 'Tony' Hernandez (pictured in 2017) was convicted in a massive drug conspiracy case in a New York City federal court Friday. He is the brother of Honduras President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez\n\nHonduras President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez (pictured giving a press conference on Friday) allegedly received $1 million from Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n ahead of the 2013 presidential campaign in exchange for favors that would have benefited the jailed drug lord's criminal enterprise\n\nLida Perdomo, of Honduras, holds a sign outside federal court in Manhattan on Friday.

I can't help saying that the jury decided to sadly believe in the word[s] of confessed murderers', he said.\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear that this verdict is not against the State of Honduras. There have been more than 67,000 Honduran deaths as a result of this fight against crime.'\n\nThe two-week trial put a spotlight on the lucrative drug trade between the United States and Honduras, where thousands of migrants have fled toward the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nTony Hern\u00e1ndez was arrested in Miami in 2018 and charged with drug trafficking and possessing illegal weapons.\n\nFederal prosecutors accused him of helping smuggle almost 200,000 kgs of cocaine into the United States while enjoying the protection of his brother.\n\nMembers of Hern\u00e1ndez's family who attended the trial were swarmed by protesters as they left the courthouse.\n\nSome protesters chanted 'Fuera JOH,' meaning 'Out with JOH,' referring to Central American nation's leader.\n\nAttorney Omar Malone said his client was disappointed by the outcome and that the jury reached its verdict despite a 'vigorous defense.'\n\nHe underscored, however, that the process was fair.\n\n'He holds his head high knowing in his own heart that what was said about him in court was inaccurate and untrue,' Malone said. 'And so he maintains to this day his innocence of the charges leveled against him and he wants to move forward. And we will.'\n\nJoaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n allegedly handed over $1 million to support the Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and his 2013 presidential campaign in exchange for protection of drug deliveries\n\nHonduran residents and supporters of the Libertad y Refundacion (LIBRE) party hang a dummy depicting Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, whose brother was convicted by a U.S. federal court in New York, during a protest on October 11\n\nA protester in Honduras called for the resignation of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez during an October 9 demonstration, a week before his brother Tony Hern\u00e1ndez was convicted by United States prosecutors over drug charges\n\nU.S. prosecutors say the drug conspiracy was protected by the Honduran government.\n\nThe trial featured testimony from Honduran drug traffickers who are now in U.S. custody and cooperating with authorities, including, Am\u00edlcar Alexander Ard\u00f3n a former mayor, and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of Honduras' Cachiros gang.\n\nSome of the most explosive testimony was from Ard\u00f3n, who told jurors that Tony Hern\u00e1ndez promised Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n protection for his shipments in exchange for a $1 million donation to his brother's presidential campaign in 2013.\n\nRivera Maradiaga, who admitted to murdering 78 people, testified that he paid bribes to multiple officials including President Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nAnother defense lawyer, Michael Tein, had argued that prosecutors had insufficient evidence and that five turncoat witnesses who admitted to dozens of killings were 'liars, losers and murderers.'\n\nThe Honduran president was not charged in the case but was labeled a co-conspirator. The president tweeted during the trial that the prosecution's allegations were '100% false, absurd and ridiculous.'\n\nMichael Tein, defense lawyer for Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, speaks to the media outside federal court and says the witnesses were 'liars, losers and murderers'\n\nA Honduran man was one of the many protesters that showed up outside a New York City federal court during the two-week trial of Tony Hern\u00e1ndez, the brother of Honduras President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, who was found guilty of drug conspiracy, weapons charges and lying to the Drug Enforcement Administration\n\nTony Hern\u00e1ndez's sentencing is set for January 17 and he could face from five years to life in prison.\n\nIn a closing argument Wednesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Emil Bove said the drug conspiracy was already over six years old in 2010 when Tony Hern\u00e1ndez and his associates gained control of the government to protect drug traffickers aligned with the country's National Party.\n\n'That is state-sponsored drug trafficking. And with that level of power and control the defendant was virtually untouchable,' he said. 'The results of that are astonishing.'\n\nHe described a scheme that began with monthly 'massive cocaine shipments' to the U.S. beginning in 2010 and said the Honduran president used the military to protect drug turf. He accused Tony Hern\u00e1ndez of using the national police to kill a rival and said that the 'ringleader' in that murder was then promoted to become chief of the force.\n\nMeanwhile, the prosecutor said, Guzman was able to travel to Honduras in 2013 twice despite being one of the most wanted people in the world.\n\nJuan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez was reelected in 2017 despite a constitutional ban on reelection.", "description": "The brother of the Honduran president was convicted Friday in a drug conspiracy case in New York.
