John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat and hero of the civil rights movement, told colleagues as he led opposition to the GOP measure.\n\nThe 228-197 vote came as part of a broader debate on Democrats\u2019 major legislative priority this year, HR 1, the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d which includes historic expansions of voter registration and access, as well as a major rewrite of campaign finance laws.\n\nThe measure would have had no practical effect even if it had passed. Illegal immigrants \u2014 and indeed noncitizens as a whole \u2014 are not legally able to participate in federal elections.\n\nBut Republicans had hoped to send a message to localities such as San Francisco, where noncitizens are now allowed to vote in school board elections.\n\nQUIZ: US Citizenship Test (Part II) -- could you pass?\n\n\u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m making it up. What kind of government would cancel the vote of its own citizens, and replace it with noncitizens?\u201d said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, Texas Republican.\n\nHe pointed to last year\u2019s vote, when 49 Democrats joined the GOP to decry noncitizen voting.\n\nOn Friday just six Democrats voted in favor.\n\nA 1996 federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections, but there is no prohibition on localities, and indeed a number of jurisdictions allow it, to some extent.\n\nFamously liberal Takoma Park, a small jurisdiction in Maryland, has for several decades allowed noncitizens, including illegal immigrants, to vote in local elections.\n\nExperts say as many as 40 states or territories allowed noncitizen voting dating back to the nation\u2019s founding.\n\nSan Francisco in July began allowing noncitizens to vote in school board elections \u2014 though they must be parents or legal guardians of students.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
