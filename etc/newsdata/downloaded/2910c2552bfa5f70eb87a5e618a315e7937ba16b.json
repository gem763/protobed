REUTERS/John Morris/File Photo\n\nNew Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh challenged Trudeau to act immediately on universal coverage for prescription drugs, and insisted the prime minister drop an appeal against a court decision ordering compensation for indigenous children harmed by federal welfare policies.\n\n\u201cOur first step is to put out our challenge and we are going to build public pressure on this,\u201d Singh told reporters after meeting with his party\u2019s lawmakers.\n\n\u201cA lot of Canadians wanted to see this government work with other parties. They need to work with other parties, and we are putting out some clear conditions,\u201d he said.\n\nTrudeau emerged from last week\u2019s election with more seats than any other party, but 13 short of being able to govern alone. The left-leaning NDP shares much of the Liberals\u2019 agenda and holds 24 seats in the 338-member House of Commons.\n\nThe prime minister\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Singh said he spoke to Trudeau only once right after the Oct. 21 election and had not talked to him since.\n\nAsked whether the prime minister should reach out to him, Singh replied: \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, Trudeau also pledged to create a national prescription drug plan if re-elected, but he provided few details, saying he would work with the provinces and northern territories to implement the changes.\n\nSingh said delivering a universal prescription drug plan was a dealbreaker for the NDP but added that fighting climate change was an issue on which the parties could work together.\n\nRegarding Singh\u2019s demand that the government drop an appeal to a human rights tribunal\u2019s decision to compensate indigenous children for past wrongs, Trudeau has said he does not oppose the idea of compensation but that more time is needed for consultation.\n\n\u201cWe know that if Mr. Trudeau wants to put in place anything national that\u2019s progressive, he\u2019s going to need our help,\u201d Singh said.\n\nUniversal drug coverage has been proposed before, but the rise of high-cost drugs has given the idea new urgency, and a single federal buyer could wield greater negotiating power against drugmakers.\n\nTo deliver such a plan, the federal government would need to strike a deal with provincial governments, a process that could drag on for years because many are led by rival parties.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday faced the first obstacles in launching his new minority government when a small opposition party demanded quick action on two priorities in exchange for its support on progressive policies.", "authors": ["Steve Scherer", "David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446624980&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1O6", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
