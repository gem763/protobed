Sometimes players have to develop into what they are going to become.\n\n'I think United want a striker like Firmino, like Son at Tottenham. I think [Solskjaer] wants that type of player.\n\n'I don't think he wants a typical striker who is basically going to be a Lukaku or a Costa.\n\n'I don't think he's looking for that type. I think he's looking for a more mobile type in a front three or a front two.\n\n'I think this club has always had strikers who can play in pairs, who contribute off the ball.\n\nNeville believes United will not target a Diego Costa equivalent either in the January window\n\n'I'll make a point about Ruud van Nistelrooy. We won less championships with him at centre-forward than when we brought Louis Saha in to partner Wayne Rooney.\n\n'He was nowhere near as good a finisher as Ruud or as good a striker as Ruud, but the team became better.\n\n'And that's my point, I don't think Ole wants a striker like that; I think he wants a mobile striker.'\n\nNeville flagged up how Liverpool jettisoned Christian Benteke after Jurgen Klopp's arrival in favour of Firmino.\n\nNeville suggested: 'I don't think Ole wants a striker like that; I think he wants a mobile striker'\n\n'He just chucked him out the club because he didn't suit his style of play,' Neville added.\n\n'Ole's done the same with Lukaku, and Lukaku is a far better player than Benteke.\n\n'Ole is not going to sign a striker just because he scores goals, because Lukaku would have done that.'", "description": "Manchester United decided to let Romelu Lukaku leave in the summer without bringing in a replacement, although they are expected to snap a striker up in the January transfer window.", "authors": ["Amitai Winehouse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/10/20027484-0-image-a-53_1571735313021.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
