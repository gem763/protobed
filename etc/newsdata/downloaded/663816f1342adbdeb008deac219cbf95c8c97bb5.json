At least once or twice a week I noticed the door kept coming off its latch.\n\n\"I decided to set up the camera for fun just to see if anything would happen. When something actually did I got a weird feeling in my gut, it\u2019s hard to describe.\n\n(Image: Michael Diamond /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Michael Diamond /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u201cI was really taken back by it and I did have a strange feeling. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m scared of Mr Fritz but I am wary of it.\u201d\n\nThe creepy doll was made by an American prisoner at Stalag II-B, a German World War II camp, now in the town of Czarne in Poland. Mr Diamond believes the prisoner worked as a ventriloquist before being taken prisoner.\n\nThe doll was apparently taken to America after the end of the war and was owned by an antiques shop in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina before it came to the UK.\n\nMr Fritz was given to Mr Diamond by a local militaria collector in July and it now lives in Mr Diamond's \"freak room\", where all his collector items are kept.\n\n(Image: Michael Diamond /SWNS.COM)\n\n(Image: Michael Diamond /SWNS.COM)\n\nThe hobbyist collector is married to Sally, 46, and has two children, Amber, 19, and Caleb, 11.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe door was being opened once or twice a week and I knew it was strange. You can see on the first night the door swing open.\n\n\u201cOn the next night you can see the eyes move before the door opens and again afterwards. The eyes flicker and his mouth moves up and down slightly.\n\n\u201cMy wife and daughter both hate it. I get why people don\u2019t like it and think it might be scary but I\u2019m not intimidated by it.\n\n(Image: Michael Diamond /SWNS.COM)\n\n\u201cI want to give it a permanent home. I get emotionally attached to my collections. What\u2019s the explanation is the one million dollar question isn\u2019t it?\n\n\u201cI have no idea myself. I don\u2019t even know where to start. There are no open windows in the room and no airflow. The door is on a latch so shouldn\u2019t just swing open.\n\n\u201cI have told Sally and Amber about it and they don\u2019t like it at all. To stop it from happening I\u2019ve chained the box up and covered it in a blanket.\u201d\n\nMr Diamond is an entertainer and travels the country performing stunts with his museum full of collectors items like taxidermy animals, spiritual props, skulls and ancient weaponry.", "description": "Michael Diamond,48, from Liverpool, put up a camera in his home after he noticed the display cabinet door kept opening at night", "authors": ["Jack Longstaff", "Anna Ye", "Image", "Michael Diamond", "Swns.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649138.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_HAUNTED_DOLL_007.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
