In the past occupied Saudi villages have been briefly entered, whereupon troops have raised the group\u2019s flags and withdrawn.\n\nMeanwhile military officials from the Yemeni government, who are also fighting the rebels, said they believed the soldiers the group claimed to have captured were in fact fighters recruited informally by the Saudi-led coalition to fight inside the kingdom\u2019s borders.\n\nThe alleged show of force follows a drone attack on a major Saudi oil field earlier this month \u2013 an assault initially claimed by Houthi soldiers but blamed on Iran by leaders from the UK, the US and the kingdom itself.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
