The refusal comes just a day after Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) sent a letter to Reddit CEO Steve Huffman about the platform\u2019s bias.\n\nThe refusal was made public by the community\u2019s moderators, just a day after Republican congressman Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) sent a letter to Reddit\u2019s CEO demanding the site correct its politically biased action, and condemning it for holding Trump-supporting Reddit users to higher standards of behavior than users of left-wing subreddits.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a more obvious and effective way to sway elections than to hide the largest conservative forum on your site a year ahead of the 2020 elections,\u201d wrote Rep. Banks.\n\nIn their response to r/The_Donald\u2019s appeal, Reddit appeared to give the Trump-supporting community an impossible task: regulate the behavior of its 700,000-plus userbase, not just on r/The_Donald itself, but across the entire website.\n\nThis is close to impossible for r/The_Donald\u2019s moderators to achieve, because they can only take enforcement actions against users on their own community, not across the whole site.\n\nAccording to Reddit, r/The_Donald cannot be removed from quarantine because its users \u201cupvote violative content\u201d at a \u201chigher rate\u201d than other Reddit communities.\n\nWe\u2019ve been clear that we expect to see notable and sustained community transformation regarding reporting and downvoting behaviors. We once again measured this quantitatively over the 60 day appeal period, using the same methodology as at your last appeal, and which we use to evaluate all quarantined subreddits. Unfortunately, we did not see the required change in these measurements; yoursubscriberscontinue to upvoteviolativecontent at a significantlyhigherrate than subreddits of a similar size and topical focus to yours, in line with the figures we see in other quarantined subreddits, across the politicalspectrum.\u201d (Please do note that we understand it can be frustrating that we can\u2019t share this methodology with you. But given the fact that your subreddit is a frequent target of those who may disagree with you or the President politically, keeping the exact methodology confidential helps protect you against brigade attempts at gaming our statistics).\n\nThe Reddit admins do not explain how r/The_Donald\u2019s moderators are expected to prevent this behavior from happening, a fact that the moderators were quick to point out.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that there can be no way to know what\u2019s being asked of us,\u201d wrote the moderator who published Reddit\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cIt seems to boil down to having a debate in which you prove your point with facts and evidence, and the other person counters with how they feel. They can\u2019t tell us why they denied us, though, they just want us to stop doing that thing that they can\u2019t tell us.\u201d\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
