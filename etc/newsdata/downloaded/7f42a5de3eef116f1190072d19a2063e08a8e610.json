(Yi-Chin Lee/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nHOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the sentencing of Ronald Haskell who was convicted of capital murder in a Houston-area attack that left six people dead (all times local):\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nA young woman who was the lone survivor of a 2014 shooting in Texas that claimed the lives of her parents and four siblings told the man sentenced to death for the killings she plans to move forward and forget about him.\n\nCassidy Stay gave a victim impact statement after jurors on Friday sentenced Ronald Lee Haskell to death for killings her parents.\n\nStay said she's no longer preoccupied with whether Haskell will ever feel remorse for what he did and that she will \"continue to live my life with happiness.\"\n\nHaskell showed no reaction to Stay's statement.\n\nThe now-20-year-old woman was 15 when she was shot in the head in the attack. She testified at trial she survived by playing dead and begged Haskell not to hurt her family.\n\n___\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nA jury has sentenced to death a man who fatally shot six members of his ex-wife's family in Texas.\n\nJurors took around four hours Friday to decide that Ronald Lee Haskell would be a future danger to society. They rejected arguments by Haskell's attorneys that his history of mental illness should spare him the lethal injection.\n\nThe same jury in September convicted Haskell of capital murder in the deaths of Stephen and Katie Stay at their suburban Houston home in 2014. Four of the couple's children were also killed in the attack, and Haskell shot a fifth child who survived by playing dead.\n\nHaskell's attorneys had asked jurors to sentence the 39-year-old Haskell to life in prison without parole.\n\nProsecutors argued Haskell faked symptoms of mental illness and carefully planned the attack.\n\n___\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nA jury is deliberating the sentence of a man who was convicted in an attack in which he fatally shot six members of his ex-wife's family in Texas.\n\nJurors in the capital murder trial of Ronald Lee Haskell got the case Friday afternoon after closing arguments in the trial's punishment phase.\n\nProsecutors are asking for a death sentence.

A juror also wiped away tears.\n\n___\n\n11:05 a.m.\n\nAn attorney for a man convicted in an attack in which he fatally shot six members of his ex-wife's family in Texas says sentencing him to death would amount to vengeance, not justice.\n\nAttorney Neal Davis III asked jurors during closing arguments Friday to spare the life of 39-year-old Ronald Lee Haskell, arguing they should sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nHaskell was convicted of capital murder last month in the 2014 attack that left six members of the Stay family dead in their Houston-area home. Davis says Haskell deserves to \"die in prison\" and spend the rest of his life thinking about what he has done.\n\nDoug Durham, another defense attorney, said anger, hatred, fear and vengeance are at the heart of prosecutors' arguments for a death sentence.\n\n___\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nA prosecutor is asking jurors to sentence to death a man who fatally shot six members of his ex-wife's family in Texas.\n\nProsecutor Samantha Knecht said Friday during closing arguments in the punishment phase of Ronald Lee Haskell's capital murder trial that \"this is the moment for justice\" for Haskell's victims.\n\nAs she talked to jurors, Knecht placed bullet casings for each of the six victims in front of the jury and more than 20 bullets for other family members that Knecht said Haskell also wanted to kill.\n\nThe same jury last month convicted Haskell of capital murder for the deaths of a couple at their suburban Houston home.
