Ahead of last week\u2019s global \u201cclimate strike,\u201d during which children were encouraged to skip school to protest the response to climate change, researchers warned that children are increasingly suffering anxiety and grief about climate change, and urged parents to discuss the issue with their kids in an age-appropriate way. (So, not \u201cThe world will end in 18 months, kids.\u201d)\n\nA spokesperson for the Climate Psychology Alliance (CPA), a group of psychologists and researchers said, \u201cThere is no doubt that they are being emotionally impacted... That real fear from children needs to be taken seriously by adults.\u201d\n\nSwedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the teenage icon of climate-change protest whose disgusted scowl at Donald Trump at the UN went viral this week, told world leaders who had failed to act on climate change that they had \u201cstolen her childhood\u201d and broke down in tears during an emotional address. She said, \u201cPeople are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.\u201d", "description": "The royal\u2019s struggles with his mental health are well-documented.
