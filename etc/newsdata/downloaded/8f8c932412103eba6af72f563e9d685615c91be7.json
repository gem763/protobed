Whistleblower complaints against Infosys management do not augur well for the whole corporate India, especially when we are talking about one of the biggest and most respected companies in India.\n\nThe corporate governance standards have certainly deteriorated in India. Not only there are a more significant number of governance issues tainting India\u2019s corporate world, but also it is happening to more prominent and trustworthy companies.\n\nLet\u2019s take the case of Sun Pharma (NS: ). Early this year, a whistleblower complaint against the management alleged that it was involved in insider trading during the Ranbaxy deal. As expected, the stock took a beating and is currently hovering at around Rs. 400 when it used to trade at around Rs. 600 early this year and Rs. 1000 levels in 2015.\n\nMost of you would be aware of the ICICI Bank (NS: ) fiasco when the conflict of interest issues came to light this year. You might remember how Deepak (NS: ) Kochhar, husband of the then CEO of ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar, was involved in a loan disbursement case with Videocon Group. The only problem with this case was that Videocon had invested in Deepak Kochhar\u2019s company Nupower, which clearly shows the conflict of interest issue here.\n\nWhile talking about corporate governance issues, how can we forget about Yes Bank (NS: ). The bank used to be investor\u2019s darling once upon a time before corporate governance issues started to surface. Yes Bank\u2019s troubles began last year when RBI alleged Yes Bank of poor compliance culture prevailing at that time. The RBI even removed its MD and CEO Rana Kapoor for not showing enough transparency with regards to stressed loans. A few months back, RBI censured Yes Bank of regulatory action as it pointed that the bank is deliberately trying to mislead the public by mentioning only the positive developments while other lapses and breaches are not disclosed. No wonder the stock is languishing at Rs. 50 levels while only six months back, it was trading at Rs. 250 levels.\n\nInvestors have been left frustrated every time a new corporate governance lapse comes to the limelight. It certainly takes away the trust factor that investors place in the capital markets in India.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corp Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Infosys Ltd, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd..
