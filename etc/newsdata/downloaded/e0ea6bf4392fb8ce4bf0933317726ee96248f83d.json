Helios and Matheson Analytics (HMNY), the parent company of MoviePass, announced today that they\u2019re pulling the plug on the famed monthly movie ticket subscription service which offered unlimited tickets for $9.95 a month.\n\nHMNY today said that it formed a strategic review committee comprised of independent directors, to identify, review and explore all strategic and financial alternatives for the company. Options include a sale of the company in its entirety, a sale of company assets like MoviePass, Moviefone and MoviePass Films. Today, MoviePass notified its subscribers that it would be \u201cinterrupting the MoviePass service\u201d effective September 14 because its efforts to recapitalize MoviePass have not been successful.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nIn July, the company had suspended the service to work on what it said were technical improvements as well as an effort to recapitalize the operation, which at its peak had burned through tens of millions of dollars a month.\n\n\u201cThe company is unable to predict if or when the MoviePass service will continue,\u201d HMNY said in a press release. \u201cThe company is continuing its efforts to seek financing to fund its operations. There can be no assurance that any such financing will be obtained or available on terms acceptable to the committee.\u201d\n\nWhere to begin to regale the tales of MoviePass? Created in 2011 by Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt, the flat-price subscription movie ticket service looked to have a renaissance when tech company Helios and Matheson Analytics took a huge stake in the service in August 2017. CEO Mitch Lowe (who had worked at Netflix) spearheaded a Netflix-esque all-you-can-eat pricing model for moviegoing, something that was commonplace in Europe but previously all but unknown to U.S. exhibition.\n\nHow the company would become profitable was an immediate question in the distribution and exhibition sectors. Neither studios nor theaters wanted to give up any share of their box office to this third-party firm, which said it would ultimately profit through the use of data. Lowe and HMNY boss Ted Farnsworth believed that rapid subscriber growth would deepen its data pool and give it leverage in Hollywood. For a time, the stock market agreed, and Helios stock traded at nearly $30 a share by late-2017. The theory was that the percentage of members actually going to the movies each month would be a minority, meaning the company would not have to fork over cash for tickets to fulfill orders. (Many compared this setup to the way many health clubs work.)\n\nThat ratio of active users to total members didn\u2019t fall into place. Instead, the company found itself having to run up huge deficits because it had promised access to any movie and was on the hook to provide tickets and fulfill its promise. Finally, in July 2018, during the opening weekend of Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, MoviePass officially blacked out. At one point MoviePass had bragged it had nearly 3M subscribers. The once-high-flying HMNY stock took a swan dive and never recovered. Following the Mission: Impossible debacle, MoviePass decided it would no longer cover big studio tentpoles on their opening weekends, instead allowing only indies and holdovers. Subscriber levels dropped to 225K as of last April.\n\nHMNY stock, which has traded over the counter since being delisted by the Nasdaq in February, closed Friday at .93 of a cent, essentially where it has been for the past few months.\n\nGetting delisted \u2014 often a fatal setback for companies with HMNY\u2019s ambitions \u2014 was far from the only blemish in the checkered record of MoviePass, which became a real-time case study in mismanagement. In just the past year alone, it elicited a fraud investigation by the state of New York; restated its financial results due to accounting errors; parted ways with its CFO and top operational executive; executed unusual (and unsuccessful) reverse-splits of its stock; and doubled down on investments in film production and financing. A month before the Fallout fallout that would sink the company, a MoviePass-backed film became of the worst-reviewed titles of 2018: the John Travolta mob biopic Gotti.\n\nStory continues", "description": "It's over.
