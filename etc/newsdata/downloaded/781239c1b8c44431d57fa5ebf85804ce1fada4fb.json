Buzz60\n\nSarah Ferguson isn't shy about owning up to the cosmetic procedures she's had.\n\nThe Duchess of York is about to celebrate her 60th birthday, but she's had a bit of help looking youthful, namely from laser face-lifts, botox, fillers and even a foot job.\n\nIn an interview with the Daily Mail, Ferguson said she gets a procedure called the ultimate laser face-lift, which is a non-invasive procedure performed by her friend, Dr. Gabriela Mercik. The duchess admitted to getting botox years ago because there was no other alternative at the time.\n\n\"I really don\u2019t like the frozen look,\" Ferguson told the outlet. \"I\u2019m so animated and I like to be myself. I don\u2019t like the thought of needles and am very glad if I look well and happy.\"\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York is engaged!

She also got organic fillers injected.\n\nSarah Ferguson opens up about getting cosmetic procedures done.

It\u2019s why I had the mesotherapy, the vitamin cocktail to hydrate and boost the skin,\" Ferguson said and noted that her father, who died, had skin cancer. \"I\u2019ve started the laser treatment, but it\u2019s not finished yet. The collagen needs to rebuild. I hope it will all be done by my birthday.\"\n\nAfter the injections, Ferguson's doctor suggested she get a non-invasive face-lift done called a thread lift. It involves inserting medical threads under the skin that pulls the face.\n\n\"Before I had it done I thought, 'Oh this is going to be painful,' but it wasn\u2019t bad. My skin responded well,\" Ferguson said. \"I think if you look at photos of me after I had it done, I look much better.\"\n\nFerguson's cosmetic procedures weren't limited only to her face and skin though; the duchess opened up about getting her feet rejuvenated as well. She said she went to the Bahamas to have regenerative stem cell therapy done. It took her six months to heal, but she notes that she can walk perfectly in heels now.\n\n\"I think my toes were ruined by all the riding I did when I was young. They shaved the bone here,\" Ferguson said while pointing to a spot on her big toe. \"And implanted stem cells \u2014 20 million of them taken from my midriff \u2014 into my feet to make new cartilage.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/10/sarah-ferguson-opens-up-cosmetic-procedures-shes-had-done/3928264002/", "description": "The Duchess of York admitted that she's had a bit of help in looking youthful, from laser facelifts, botox, injections, fillers and even a foot job.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
