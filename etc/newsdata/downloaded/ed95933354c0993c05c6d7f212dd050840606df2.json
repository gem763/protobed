She faces from five to 99 years in prison.\n\nThe unusual circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Jean, who was black, and the trial of Ms. Guyger, who is white, has roiled Dallas, a city that has been shaken both by racial tension and the targeted killings of police officers in years past.\n\nBotham Jean's mother, Allison Jean, escorted by civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, is hugged by family members outside the courtroom after Amber Guyger was found guilty of murder, Tuesday.

Lee Merritt, one of the family\u2019s attorneys. \u201cIt is a signal that the tide is going to change here. Police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions.And we believe that will begin to change policing culture all over the world.\u201d\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors cast Ms. Guyger as careless and trigger-happy, saying she was making plans to meet up for a tryst with her police partner, Martin Rivera, before a conversation with him left her so distracted that she made a series of terrible decisions.\n\nMs. Guyger broke down sobbing during her testimony and said she wished she\u2019d died instead.\n\n\u201cI feel like a terrible person, I feel like a piece of crap,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t deserve the chance to be with my family and friends...I am so sorry. This is not about hate, it\u2019s about being scared that night.\u201d\n\nMs. Guyger said she heard noises in the apartment shortly before opening the door, became terrified, and went in to find the intruder.\n\nShe said Mr. Jean began coming toward her, yelling \u201cHey, hey\u201d as she ordered him to show his hands. She said she fired her service weapon because she was afraid he would kill her.\n\nAfter she shot him, she realized she was in the wrong apartment and called 911.\n\nProsecutors questioned why Ms. Guyger had chosen to enter the apartment by herself when she thought there was a burglar inside, rather than remaining outside the door and calling for backup.\n\nThey argued she hadn\u2019t fully attended to Mr. Jean as he lay dying and was more concerned with losing her own job in the moments after the shooting.\n\nProsecutors also questioned how genuine Ms. Guyger\u2019s grief was, saying that she had begun sending sexual texts to her work partner again only days after the shooting.\n\n\u201cHow long did that remorse last, a day or two?\u201d Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus asked.\n\n\u201cIt has lasted every day,\u201d Ms. Guyger said.\n\nWhether Ms. Guyger walking into the wrong apartment was a reasonable mistake remained the central point of contention during the trial for the jury.\n\nIn a survey of building residents, more than 90 said they had accidentally walked to the wrong door on at least one occasion, defense attorney Robert Rogers said.\n\nProsecutors countered that none of those instances had resulted in the shooting death of a resident.\n\nTwo lawmen\u2014Texas Ranger David Armstrong, who led the post-shooting investigation, and Craig Miller, a retired Dallas deputy police chief\u2014told the court outside of the jury\u2019s presence that they believed Ms. Guyger\u2019s actions were reasonable.\n\nThat testimony was deemed inadmissible.\n\nIn deliberating the case, Judge Tammy Kemp allowed the jury to consider Texas\u2019s so-called Castle Doctrine law, similar to stand-your-ground statutes, which allows someone to use deadly force to defend their own home or property. Prosecutors and lawyers for Mr. Jean\u2019s family had said the law shouldn\u2019t be considered because Ms. Guyger was the intruder.\n\nThe jury in the case, made up of mostly people of color, had the option of finding Ms. Guyger guilty of murder, the charge on which she was indicted, or manslaughter. The jury began deliberating on Monday.\n\nThe sentencing phase of the trial began Tuesday afternoon with Mr. Jean\u2019s mother testifying, and it was scheduled to continue Wednesday.\n\nWrite to Dan Frosch at dan.frosch@wsj.com", "description": "A jury found a former Dallas police officer guilty of murder for shooting and killing her upstairs neighbor after she mistakenly walked into the wrong apartment.", "authors": ["Dan Frosch", "Elizabeth Findell"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-112683/social"}
