I didn\u2019t have any concerns, it\u2019s in my blood to do this.\u2019\n\nHere, the TV maestro tells us more about brand new The X Factor.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nQ: Why did you decide to change up the normal version of the show?\n\nIt just felt so obvious to do a celebrity version.\n\nThe only condition was I couldn\u2019t know who was going to be on it.\n\nI said to the team, \u2018You\u2019ve got to find some acts who you believe can sell records off the back of this, because if you don\u2019t do that it won\u2019t work\u2019.\n\nSo that was the deal and we stuck to it.\n\nI swear to God I didn\u2019t have a clue who any of the acts were.\n\nSo I thought that was fun and very exciting for the show.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nQ: They do say a change is as good as a rest...\n\nExactly!\n\nI think change in any aspect is good, but I was saying to someone the other day, \u2018I\u2019ve signed Westlife, I\u2019ve signed Five, Il Divo, One Direction, Little Mix.\n\nThey\u2019re all groups, but they\u2019re all different\u2019.\n\nSometimes you\u2019ve got to take a break of at least a year, two years between signing one kind of group then launching another.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the same with The X Factor.\n\nYou can\u2019t just keep making the same show that it was 14 years ago and expect it to be the same show today.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to take a step back for a little while.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nQ: Do you think Louis is different this time around?\n\nI do.\n\nApart from anything else, you have to remember Louis was a manager when I first met him.\n\nSo we\u2019ve worked together on a lot of acts that he\u2019s managed.\n\nI\u2019ve never really ever had a disagreement with Louis over an artist or a decision or anything else.\n\nWe\u2019re genuinely friends and that was part of the decision to have him on the show again this year.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the fact that he\u2019s been on the show, it\u2019s that it reminded me, unlike other people, that managers can be great friends as well.\n\nLouis is a great guy.\n\nHe\u2019s a great friend.\n\nHe\u2019s gone away and has taken that time to remember what makes him tick, and that\u2019s music.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nQ: How did it feel getting together with Louis and Nicole again?\n\nSitting with the two of them was like we picked it up five minutes ago.\n\nI think Nicole is great because the funny thing is everyone thinks that she\u2019s super-confident, but she\u2019s not.\n\nShe\u2019s an incredibly dignified person.\n\nThe thing with her as well is she\u2019ll speak directly to the team rather than going through the press.\n\nIt\u2019s so rare to find that now, a million per cent, she\u2019s special.\n\nHow did it feel filming the auditions at your house?\n\nWhen we filmed it that night it didn\u2019t feel like work.\n\nI loved every second of it.\n\nI said to the producers, \u2018If this really doesn\u2019t work, we will have to re-audition for the show. That\u2019s the deal\u2019.\n\nSo the fact that I felt we didn\u2019t need to was just great.\n\nI found it interesting and fun, and doing this version of the show has also given me the chance to do All Stars.\n\nI\u2019ve wanted to make the best of the best version of The X Factor for a long, long time. It\u2019s been brilliant.\n\nQ: What did you think of the celebs when you first met them?\n\nI tell you what, I was really surprised and happy about how much they cared about being on the show.\n\nWith the celebrities, they really wanted it.\n\nI felt that if they bring that energy to the show and hopefully we can do our job, which is to help them make some great records, you know, we\u2019ve got some really good artists on our hands.\n\n- The X Factor: Celebrity is on tonight (Saturday) at 8.35pm on ITV", "description": "The X Factor: Celebrity is just like The X Factor - but not as we know it - as Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger return to judging panel alongside Simon Cowell", "authors": ["Jenny Rodger", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20543372.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_SycoThamesITVa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
