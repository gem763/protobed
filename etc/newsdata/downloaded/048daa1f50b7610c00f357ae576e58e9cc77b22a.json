I put a lot of pressure on myself, and I\u00b4m always looking for work on the field and to try and do more. I just think it is better for me to keep on playing.\"\n\nKolisi says South Africa do not know Canada as well as their regular opponents in the Rugby Championship and Europe and so must concentrate on getting their own systems and execution right.\n\n\"It comes down to what we have been doing every week. We always look at the previous game and see where we can improve,\" he said. \"You do look at the other team, their attacking players and how they kick.\n\n\"But we don\u00b4t really know what to expect from their individuals, so we will do our own preparations.\"\n\nKolisi is the first black test captain of the Springboks, a hugely significant appointment for a team that was once seen as an iconic symbol of white South Africa during the Apartheid years.\n\nWhile he acknowledges his role as an inspirational figure for young black players he said he did not feel his race should be a factor in how people view him.\n\n\"I\u00b4m just very happy to be captain, being the first black captain is not something that I keep in my mind the whole time,\" he added.\n\n\"It is a privilege, as it would be for anybody that comes from my community, and I just want to represent them well.\"\n\nSouth Africa's players will be given two days off after the Canada match to spend time with their families having already been in Japan for five weeks, and for Kolisi it is a chance to reunite with his wife Rachel.\n\n\"Almost all our families, wives and girlfriends are out here. I\u00b4m pretty excited to have my wife and children out watching the game,\" he said.\n\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "description": "By Nick SaidKOBE, Oct 7 (Reuters) - South Africa are expected to breeze past Canada in Tuesday's Rugby World Cup match but while the Springboks see the game...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
