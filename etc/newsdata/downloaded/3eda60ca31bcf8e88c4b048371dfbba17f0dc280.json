The document, which also includes an affidavit by his niece Carol Thompson, was originally filed Sept. 9 but had to be refiled because the wrong date for the exhumation was given.\n\nThe permit allows the family to \u201cdisinter,\u201d \u201cremove\u201d and \u201creinter human remains.\u201d\n\nBut Crown Hill Cemetery has refused to remove the body and the matter is now in the courts.\n\nCemetery officials have said in a statement they had a \u201cduty to ensure the safety and integrity of the cemetery.\u201d\n\nInitially, his body was to be exhumed as part of a History channel documentary but the network decided to cease production of the documentary last month.\n\nThompson contends his uncle is not buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.
