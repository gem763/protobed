His retrial ended with a guilty verdict on Thursday afternoon for planning \u201cthe terrorist act,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\nKhaled and Mahmoud Khayat were arrested after police raids in Sydney. Police had said that high-grade explosives used to make the bomb were flown from Turkey as part of a plot \u201cinspired and directed\u201d by the Islamic State.\n\nThe court will hear sentencing submissions later, the Australian Associated Press reported.\n\nThe verdict in Mahmoud\u2019s case came only a few hours before Lebanon\u2019s military court acquitted another brother, Amer Khayat, of the plotting to blow up the Etihad flight.\n\nThe military court sentenced the three other Khayat brothers - Khaled, Mahmoud and Tareq - in absentia to hard labor for life, Lebanese state news agency NNA said late on Wednesday.\n\nLebanon\u2019s police said in 2017 that Tareq was an Islamic State commander in Syria.\n\nKhaled, Mahmoud and Amer were all living in Australia but occasionally visited Lebanon. Amer landed in Beirut in July 2017 on the day of the plot to smuggle the bomb onto the plane, Lebanon\u2019s interior minister said at the time.", "description": "An Australian court has found a man guilty of planning to blow up an Etihad Airways flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi nearly two years ago with a bomb hidden in a meat grinder, a spokeswoman for the New South Wales Supreme Court said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
