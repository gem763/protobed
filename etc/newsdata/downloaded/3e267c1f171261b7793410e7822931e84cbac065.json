The idea of shutting down parliament offended everyone across the country, and then they felt they were not being told the truth.\u201d\n\nJolyon Maugham QC, the anti-Brexit barrister who was second petitioner in the case, said: \u201cWe believe that the effect of the decision is that parliament is no longer prorogued.\u201d\n\nLabour MP David Lammy said: \u201cLet\u2019s unlock the doors tomorrow. Or are you afraid of the UK\u2019s sovereign parliament taking back control?\u201d\n\nThe government said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the decision of the senior Scottish judges, adding proroguing parliament was \u201d legal and necessary.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated.", "description": "The decision is expected to now go to the UK Supreme Court next week.", "authors": ["Assistant Political Editor", "Huffpost Uk"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d78b9722300001c05512c5a.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
