Or smarter? Do you dream of having a top student or star athlete? Or a child free of inheritable #diseases? Can human #GeneEditing eventually make this and more possible? #TheScienceBehindIt Take the quiz!', read the now deleted tweet.\n\nThe video opens with people putting notes on a diagram of a body while saying 'I guess I would like to be taller,' 'I would like to change body fat,' 'let's prevent baldness' and 'take away dyslexia.'\n\nThe script says: 'This type of gene editing is still in the realm of science fiction. But it might not always be.' It says five 'everyday people' were asked to consider pros and cons.\n\nThe tweet, also removed, included emojis and a quiz at the bottom for Twitter users, which one can assume it would let them design their own baby\n\nOne man then said, 'create the perfect human being ... that's pretty cool,' while others standing around him shake their heads and say no.\n\n'You want the best qualities to be put into your offspring,' one man said. 'I want my child to be the best version of not just me but him or her. So if I can control that or have some control over that, I don't mind it. I don't hate it.'\n\nAlthough the academic world was disturbed by video and tweet, the public was more intrigued by the information\n\nWhile other Twitter users seemed to agree with those who oppose the gene editing process\n\nCreating designer babies involves altering DNA in embryos, eggs or sperm and has been long feared by many -- specifically those in the academic field.\n\nNational Academy of Science has recently published a statement about the video and its removal on its page.\n\n'This page on the topic of human genome editing has been deleted. We are concerned that the content, including a video, left the missimpression that the use of genome editing for the 'enhancement' of human traits is permissible or taken lightly,' it reads.\n\nAccording to Paul Knoepfler, a University of California, Davis biologist who criticized them on Twitter, the video and tweet have suggested suggest 'a cavalier attitude toward this serious topic\n\n'The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has recommended that non-heritable genome editing should be limited to the treatment or prevention of disease or disability. Like other scientific and medical organizations, we have stated that heritable (germline) genome editing should not proceed at this time.'\n\n'Human genome editing requires much more research and public discussion of the ethics and governance of its potential uses.'\n\nWHAT IS CRISPR-CAS9? CRISPR-Cas9 is a tool for making precise edits in DNA, discovered in bacteria. The acronym stands for 'Clustered Regularly Inter-Spaced Palindromic Repeats'. The technique involves a DNA cutting enzyme and a small tag which tells the enzyme where to cut. The CRISPR/Cas9 technique uses tags which identify the location of the mutation, and an enzyme, which acts as tiny scissors, to cut DNA in a precise place, allowing small portions of a gene to be removed By editing this tag, scientists are able to target the enzyme to specific regions of DNA and make precise cuts, wherever they like. It has been used to 'silence' genes - effectively switching them off. When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA. In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome. The approach has been used previously to edit the HBB gene responsible for a condition called \u03b2-thalassaemia.\n\nAccording to Paul Knoepfler, a University of California, Davis biologist who criticized them on Twitter, the video and tweet have suggested suggest 'a cavalier attitude toward this serious topic.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota bioethicist Leigh Turner said the video portrayed serious issues with a 'reality television feel' and 'in this bubbly, superficial way.'\n\n'I'm trying to imagine what was going on in their minds,' he said of those responsible for the video. 'It's kind of funny and cringe-inducing at the same time.'\n\nAlthough the academic world was disturbed by video and tweet, the public was more intrigued by the information.\n\n'I don't understand the problem', one Twitter user shared.\n\n'We could potentially edit out diseases and conditions, and make babies really desirable and virtually guarantee their lavish attention'.", "description": "The National Academy of Sciences sparked in outrage in the academic world after posting a video showing people casually discussing gene editing and designer babies this week.", "authors": ["Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/21/19269888-0-image-a-21_1570133423869.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
