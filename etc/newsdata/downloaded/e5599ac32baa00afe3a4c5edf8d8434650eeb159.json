REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo\n\nKoizumi was speaking on the eve of a United Nations climate summit in New York where activists plan to float a blimp showing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe emerging from a bucket of coal to protest Japan\u2019s pans to build new coal-fired power plants.\n\n\u201cIn politics there are so many issues, sometimes boring. On tackling such a big-scale issue like climate change, it\u2019s got to be fun, it\u2019s got to be cool. It\u2019s got to be sexy too,\u201d Koizumi told a news conference in New York.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to realising a decarbonised society, and we are ready to contribute as a more powerful country in the fight against climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nJapanese students in Tokyo were among the millions of young people who took to the streets on Friday to express the fear and outrage they feel over the failure of governments to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high last year.\n\nConsidered a rising star on Japan\u2019s political scene, Koizumi, 38, became the third youngest lawmaker to join a post-World War Two Japanese cabinet when Abe announced a reshuffle this month.\n\nThe son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, he is regularly rated by voters as the lawmaker they would most like to see in the top job when Abe steps down.\n\nAlthough Japan is not due to speak at the climate summit on Monday, Koizumi said he was in New York to learn more about the state of negotiations on global greenhouse gas emissions and meet clean technology companies and Japanese students.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has told governments they should only turn up to the summit if they came armed with more ambitious plans to cut carbon emissions under the 2015 Paris Agreement to avert runaway global warming.\n\nGuterres has also urged governments not to build any new coal power plants after 2020 - setting him at odds with Japan, which is the only G7 country to be adding coal-fired power generation capacity. Japan\u2019s government and banks also play an important role in financing new coal plants elsewhere in Asia.\n\nNevertheless, Koizumi said he wanted Japan to do more on climate, invoking his country\u2019s role in forging the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken the strong action and powerful leadership since then, but from now on, from today, we want to do more,\u201d Koizumi said, without giving details.\n\nKoizumi sparked controversy shortly after being appointed when he told his first news conference that he wants Japan to close down nuclear reactors to avoid a repeat of the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011. Isshu Sugawara, newly-appointed as trade minister, responded by saying it would be unrealistic to rid Japan of nuclear power.\n\nKoizumi reiterated his opposition to nuclear power on Sunday. \u201cI want to realise a society, a country, with no fear about the nuclear crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t easy, it\u2019s a complicated issue. But I\u2019ll try my best to reduce the nuclear power in the future.\u201d", "description": "Japan's new environment minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, pledged on Sunday to mobilise young people to push his coal-dependent country towards a low-carbon future by making the fight against climate change \"sexy\" and \"fun.\"", "authors": ["Matthew Green", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190922&t=2&i=1432683030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8L0OM", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
