They don\u2019t want more dither and delay ... I don't want a delay.\u201d\n\nOn whether he would sack his aide Dominic Cummings, he said: \u201cLook, advisers advise and ministers decide\u201d \u2013 one of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s phrases used by Tory MP Margot James this week.\n\nJohnson added: \u201cI must say I\u2019m perplexed by the decision of the leader of the opposition and the SNP to run away from an election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never known an opposition in the history of democracy that\u2019s refused to have an election but that\u2019s their choice. I think obviously they don\u2019t trust the people, they don\u2019t think that the people will vote for them, so they\u2019re refusing to have an election.\n\n\u201cAnd so what we will do is we will go to the summit on the 17th (October), we\u2019ll get a deal and we'll come out on October 31.\u201d\n\nRegarding the split in his party and when asked at what point he might resign, Johnson said: \u201cWhat I said is that we had to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Jeremy Corbyn, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\n\nAsked again at what point he might resign, he said: \u201cWell, I mean, after those three objectives have been accomplished I will... at some point after those three objectives have been accomplished.\u201d", "description": "Boris Johnson is in Scotland today continuing to campaign for a general election he is yet to successfully call, after a torrid 24 hours in which his brother Jo resigned from government over his Brexit policy. Mr Johnson grappled with a huge bull, refused to rule out resigning if he fails to secure a general election or a Brexit deal, and was condemned by the chief of West", "authors": ["Adam Forrest"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/10/boris-aberdeenshire3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
