Baig)\n\nYour kids love electronics. You\u2019d love it if they\u2019d read more. Amazon hopes to meet you both in the middle with a new Kindle for the young e-readers in the family.\n\nThe company is launching a $109.99 Kindle Kids Edition, which it describes as a first-ever dedicated reading experience built just for kids. Preorders begin today.\n\nFeaturing a 6-inch (167 ppi) e-ink display and adjustable front light, the hardware is identical to the entry-level Kindle Amazon that sells for $20 less, meaning it does a very good job of replicating the experience of reading on paper.\n\nWhat parents pay a premium for then is a bundle that includes a special kid-friendly case (blue, pink, rainbow birds or space designs) and wallpapers, a two-year guarantee that Amazon will replace a broken unit you send back for no extra charge, and a one-year subscription to Amazon\u2019s FreeTime Unlimited. That\u2019s the service that provides access to a selection of curated e-books, all inside a password-protected \u201cwalled garden.\u201d\n\n(Once the year is up, FreeTime Unlimited fees range from $2.99 a month for a Prime member with a single child to $9.99 monthly for a non-Prime family with up to four kids.)\n\nFinding age-appropriate content\n\nMore than 2,500 age-appropriate e-books are being made available, including chapter books and titles such as \u201cIsland of the Blue Dolphins,\u201d \u201cEl Deafo\u201d and \u201cBridge to Terabithia.\u201d The environment is ad-free, and Amazon says it won\u2019t share reading data with advertisers or third parties.\n\nThe Kindle Kids Edition comes in a case designed with rainbow birds.

Baig)\n\nThe company will serve up recommendations of books the kids might like based on characters and themes; kids can search for available content themselves, even if they don\u2019t know the precise title or misspell a word \u2013 Amazon calls this \u201cfuzzy search.\u201d So they might type in \"Hary Potter\" instead of \"Harry,\" for instance.\n\nAmazon will recommend books for a child to read in the Kindle Kids Edition. (Photo: Edward C. Baig)\n\nParents have visibility into the kids' reading activity and progress through a dashboard they can access remotely on a phone, computer or tablet.\n\nThe regular Kindle shopping experiences found on the company\u2019s other dedicated e-readers are off-limits to the child.\n\nComing soon are a Spanish-language library and hundreds of audiobooks from Amazon-owned Audible that kids can listen to via Bluetooth headphones or a speaker.\n\nFacebook encryption: Why the government doesn't want Facebook to encrypt your messages\n\nParents can add other e-books or Audible content they deem appropriate.\n\nFor those families that already have Kindles, there's an option that doesn't involve adding yet another device to the home.Through a software update coming in January, parents can convert current and selected previous-generation Kindle e-readers to a kid-friendly reader with the FreeTime interface.\n\nSince FreeTime Unlimited spans an age range from 3 to 12, parents can set filters to surface content that is more relevant for their particular child.\n\nBeyond the Kindle Kids Edition, Amazon announced the expansion of Amazon FreeTime parental controls and FreeTime Unlimited to even more devices, including select Fire TV streaming devices and soon smart TVs, and a new $199.99 Fire HD 10 Kids Edition tablet that comes with a risk-free two-year guarantee. FreeTime Unlimited on the tablet includes access to more than 20,000 books, Audible books, videos, educational apps and games, along with all of the books available in the Kindle Kids Edition.\n\nHelping the kids become better readers\n\nSome of the features on this new child-friendly Kindle have been around for a few years, but still they might encourage the kids to read more, or at least help them better understand what they\u2019re consuming.\n\nThe Word Wise feature familiar to some Kindle owners, for example, places simple short definitions in smaller type above somewhat challenging words for a younger reader. Just above the word \"bewitched,\" for instance, is the simple explanation \"to use magic on someone.\u201d Parents can choose to surface more or fewer Word Wise definitions based on reading level.\n\nWord Wise feature helps kids with definitions.

Baig)\n\nIf your child looks up a word in the dictionary, it will be added to a Vocabulary Builder where it can be used in flashcards that may help the kid learn.\n\nKids can earn \u201cachievement badges\u201d based on predefined goals, from an \u201cover-achiever\u201d who exceeds his or her daily goal to a \u201csuper book worm\u201d who meets the goals that have been set for seven straight days.\n\nThe new Kindle Kids Edition and Fire HD 10 Kids Edition both start shipping Oct. 30; Amazon says for a limited time, people who buy two of the Kindles can save 25%.\n\nAs with other Kindles, Amazon is promising battery life that lasts weeks, not mere days, eliminating any excuses the kids might have for not reading because the Kindle ran out of juice.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/10/07/amazon-announces-kindle-for-kids/3863191002/", "description": "Amazon describes its new $109.99 Kindle Kids Edition as a first ever dedicated reading experience built just for kids.
