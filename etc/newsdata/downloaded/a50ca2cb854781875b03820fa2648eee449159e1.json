However, he has maintained close ties to Canada over the years.\n\nLewis went 41-2-1 as a pro, including a run as undisputed heavyweight champion.\n\nGreg Rusedski \u2014 tennis\n\nIn 1995, Rusedski made the decision to represent his mother's homeland of Great Britain.\n\nThe decision led to boos for the native of Pointe-Claire, Que., in Montreal at the Canadian Open, where he lost in the first round in 1995.\n\nRusedski reached a career-high world ranking of No. 4 and made the final of the U.S. Open in 1997, representing Great Britain.\n\nGreg Rusedski of Great Britain flies the Union Jack during Davis Cup tennis action.

They both had dual citizenship.\n\nWhile they started skating for Canada in pairs, they switched to ice dance and eventually represented France.\n\nThe team won world championship gold in 1991 and Olympic silver in 1992 in Albertville, France.\n\nIsabelle and Paul are members of the Ottawa Sport Hall of Fame.\n\nOwen Hargreaves \u2014 soccer\n\nThe Calgary-born midfielder was cut from the Canadian under-17 team before the age group World Cup in 1996.\n\nWith a Welsh mother and English father, Hargreaves had three possible countries to represent. He eventually chose England, making 42 appearances for the national team.\n\nHargreaves also spent time with two of the biggest international clubs \u2014 Bayern Munich and Manchester United.\n\nDespite being born in Canada, Owen Hargreaves spent his entire career playing nationally for England. (Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)\n\nJonathan De Guzman \u2014 soccer\n\nBorn in Toronto, De Guzman joined a club in the Netherlands when he was 12.\n\nThe 31-year-old eventually gained Dutch citizenship and made the decision to represent that country in 2008.\n\nDe Guzman's brother, Julian, also went to Europe as a teenager, but has represented Canada.\n\nAsmir Begovic \u2014 soccer\n\nThe 32-year-old goalkeeper played for host Canada at the 2007 U-20 World Cup, but decided to play for Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he was born, two years later.\n\nBegovic's family moved to Edmonton when he was 10.\n\nBegovic was Bosnia and Herzegovina's starting goalkeeper at the 2014 World Cup.\n\nTony Esposito \u2014 hockey\n\nA member of Canada's 1972 Summit Series-winning team, the goaltender from Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., decided to represent the U.S. at the 1981 Canada Cup, about a month after earning citizenship.\n\nThen 37, Esposito got the Americans to the semifinals before they lost 4-1 to Canada at the Montreal Forum.\n\nTeam Canada's Clark Gillies raises his arm on top of Team USA goalie Tony Esposito, after a goal in the 1981 Canada Cup.
