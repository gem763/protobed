REUTERS/Emmanuel Braun/Files\n\nThe analysis by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a leading philanthropic funder of health and development, found that some half a billion people worldwide still don\u2019t get basic health and education, and girls everywhere suffer disadvantage.\n\n\u201cGaps between countries, districts, and boys and girls prove that the world\u2019s investments in development aren\u2019t reaching everyone,\u201d said the Foundation\u2019s Goalkeepers report, which tracks progress on reducing poverty and improving health.\n\nIt found that despite gains in girls\u2019 educational attainment, women\u2019s life chances are limited by social norms, discriminatory laws and policies, and gender-based violence.\n\nIn an interview on the report\u2019s findings, Gates Foundation chief executive Sue Desmond-Hellmann said its clearest warnings were of \u201cthe perils of gender and geography\u201d.\n\nShe cited data in the report which showed for example that more children die in Chad every day than in Finland every year, and that while Finland\u2019s average education is up to college level, in Chad, the average child doesn\u2019t finish primary school.\n\n\u201cGender remains a massive negative on equality, so making sure we address gender inequality is the first thing,\u201d Desmond-Hellmann told Reuters.\n\n\u201cBut the second thing is that if you\u2019re a girl born in (one of the poorest parts of Africa), geography is also stacked against you. It\u2019s just not okay that a child in Chad is 55 times more likely to die than a child in Finland.\u201d\n\nThe Goalkeepers report is compiled annually by the Gates Foundation and tracks progress on United Nations sustainable development goals which aim to reduce inequality and poverty and improve health around the world by 2030.\n\nWhile it found \u201cunabated\u201d development progress, with life, health and prosperity improving on average across the world, it also highlighted \u201cpersistent gaps\u201d which mean many people are being left behind.\n\nThe report called for a new approach to development to help close these gaps, targeting the poorest people in the countries and areas that need to make up the most ground.\n\nFocusing on three policy areas, it said governments should prioritise primary healthcare to deliver health systems that help the poorest, boost digital coverage to help their least-empowered people, and support farmers facing the impact of climate change.", "description": "Despite steady development gains, a child's birthplace is still the biggest predictor of its future health, and no matter which country you're born in, life is harder if you're a girl, a major report said on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430696182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G081", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
