A dupe is a product that in some ways works as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 a fancier, more famous thing, and we're sharing our favorites. Welcome to Dupes Week. Photo: Courtesy Walt Disney Productions\n\nFirst, we should say what a dupe is not. A dupe is not a doppelg\u00e4nger or a knockoff or an impersonation \u2014 at least not explicitly so. With our experience testing and reviewing lots of products that are just like other products, we aren\u2019t particularly interested in those that are trying to be anything else. We prefer the thing that is simply itself, and in the process of being itself, just so happens to work just as well as \u2014 or sometimes, even better than \u2014 a fancier, more expensive, or more well-known product. It\u2019s about function more than fashion, like a vacuum cleaner that\u2019s as powerful as a Dyson but costs half as much, an incredibly Creuset-like cast-iron Dutch oven, or a pair of clogs from Amazon that your boss mistakes for No. 6. Welcome to Dupes Week at the Strategist.\n\nThe eco-friendly diapers cheaper than Honest Company\u2019s\n\nCloud Island Club Pack Diapers After using Honest Company\u2019s chemical-, fragrance-, and synthetic-material-free diapers for his first kid, writer Steven John says that, following the birth of his second, he turned to Cloud Island \u2014 which also offers comfortable, absorbent diapers free of those worrisome ingredients. John admits that Cloud Island, as a brand, lacks the trust that Honest Company has built among consumers over the years \u2014 and that its diapers don\u2019t come in as many playful prints or patterns. But they do cost ten cents less per diaper than Honest Company\u2019s, which John notes \u201ccan add up to hundreds of dollars over the course of a year of diapering.\u201d $22 for 104 at Target Buy\n\nThe portable mic that turns any room into K-Town karaoke\n\nTzumi Portable Karaoke System \u201cThis is for sure the simplest way to re-create everything a private karaoke room has to offer minus the $300 bar tab,\u201d according to writer David Lerner Schwartz. Part Bluetooth microphone, part wireless speaker, this so-called karaoke system even has a retractable holder for your phone \u2014 making it a fun surprise to whip out at parties, as well as an unexpected wedding or engagement gift, he adds. Just don\u2019t expect a recording-studio-quality solo: \u201cIt\u2019s really more akin to singing inside the trunk of a Ford Taurus than a large music hall.\u201d $15 at Amazon Buy $15 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe binoculars that are as good as a telescope\n\nNikon 8248 ACULON A211 10x50 Binocular $98 (was $120, now 18% off) Rena J. Mosteirin can see the Milky Way from her backyard at night and even has attended some meetings held by the Springfield Telescope Makers Society \u2014 a Vermont-based group that sets up homemade telescopes annually at Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site. But if you\u2019re also interested in getting a closer look at celestial bodies, she recommends that you buy this pair of Nikon binoculars instead of a telescope. They\u2019re easier to use than a telescope, she explains, and they still let you see moons and stars. Plus, she writes, \u201cThe beauty of binoculars is they fit right in your backpack. And you can also grab them to go bird-watching or whale-watching, or spying on your neighbors; if you happen to live next to a bear sanctuary, it can get pretty interesting.\u201d $98 at Amazon Buy $98 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe resurfacing treatment that\u2019s better than Sunday Riley\u2019s\n\nThe ceramic knives that are as good as a handcrafted Japanese chef\u2019s knife\n\nTakiup Ceramic Knife Set Hannah Howard owns a handcrafted Japanese chef\u2019s knife, which she bought right after college and loves. \u201cIn my hand, it just feels right,\u201d she writes; but \u201cso do the colorful ceramic knives in this set of six that costs less than $24.\u201d They don\u2019t pick up funky smells, they\u2019re featherlight, and they can even survive a trip through the dishwasher. $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe workout tee that\u2019s as versatile as one from Outdoor Voices\n\nWeatherproof 32 Degree HEAT - Women's Base Layer Long Sleeve Shirt Searching for a T-shirt that she could both work out in and wear to work, Priya Krishna found an Outdoor Voices top for $55 that fit the bill \u2014 until it was replaced by this shirt from 32 Degrees, gifted to her by her mom. \u201cIn both cases, you basically get an exercise top disguised as a nice top. In both cases, the fabric is breathable and comfortable and doesn\u2019t get damp spots at the armpits, perhaps due to a comparable form of cooling technology,\u201d she writes. $12 at Amazon Buy $7 at 32 Degrees Buy\n\nThe Apple dongle dupe recommended by the guy at the Apple Store\n\nAnker USB C Hub Adapter Steven John recently bought a new MacBook Pro, which has just two USB-C ports, and realized that he needed a bunch of Apple dongles in order to connect his external monitor and wireless mouse. Turns out the Apple Store guy recommended that he buy this hub adapter from Anker instead of a dongle from Apple, which he describes as \u201csimply too expensive. The Anker model I use has two USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, and both an SD and a Micro SD slot \u2014 and it\u2019s never given me any problems.\u201d $24 at Amazon Buy $24 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe less expensive sheet set that feels like sleeping at a fancy hotel\n\nItalic Slumber Cotton Sleep Set \u201cApparently Italic uses the same manufacturers as the Frettes of the world before selling directly to consumers at factory prices, thus eliminating extreme markups,\u201d writes Chloe Anello of this cotton sheet set. And after putting them head to head against a pair of (very expensive) Frette sheets, she concluded, \u201cI actually slept better on the less expensive version.\u201d $115 at Italic Buy\n\nThe eyebrow pen that makes brows looks like they\u2019ve been microbladed\n\nMaybelline Tattoo Studio Brow Tint Pen Using this drugstore brow pen from Maybelline, Crystal Martin says, \u201cI get a naturally thick brow effect that is not unlike that of microblading. Without any of the pain (or $$$$).\u201d Granted, it\u2019s not permanent, or even semipermanent, like microblading is, but, \u201cI\u2019m here for a look \u2014 dark, dense, natural \u2014 and the pen does that better than any product I\u2019ve tried.\u201d $10 at Ulta Beauty Buy $8 at Walmart Buy\n\nThe workout gear that looks status-y but costs under $100\n\nColorfulkoala Women's High Waisted Pattern Legging Our senior writer Karen Iorio Adelson surveyed trainers and fitness instructors to find the best athleisure dupes, and they recommended a bunch of less expensive options \u2014 including Forever 21 leggings that look like they\u2019re from Carbon 38, Reebok shorts that recall Patagonia Baggies, and these patterned leggings that are \u201cvery reminiscent of these Lululemon Align leggings \u2014 but for less than a third of the price.\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Amazon flatware that looks like Christofle\n\nWinco 12-Piece Dots Dinner Fork Set After admiring her mother\u2019s Christofle dinnerware, Charlotte Klein found this Winco flatware that\u2019s a \u201ca near-identical version on Amazon, beaded detail and all.\u201d She writes, \u201cThey\u2019re not as heavy or substantial as the Christofle; each piece is not personally made by a silversmith in Normandy, France. But they\u2019ve made me appreciate the idea of elegant flatware.\u201d $14 at Amazon Buy $14 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe mattress that\u2019s just about as comfortable as a Casper and costs a third of the price\n\nSignature Sleep Honest Elements Mattress, King $678 (was $882, now 23% off) Steven John owns, and loves, his Casper Wave mattress. But when it came to finding a mattress for the guest bedroom, he wanted to spend a little less without forgoing comfort. Enter this Signature Sleep Honest Elements Mattress. As he explains, \u201cIn both products, the mattresses breathe well, allowing excellent airflow that keeps you evenly cool and that draws away that moisture that might otherwise leave you feeling hot and sweaty or cold and clammy depending on the ambient conditions.\u201d $678 at Amazon Buy $678 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe $6 dupe for Rosie Huntington-Whitley\u2019s favorite eye shadow\n\nColourPop Super Shock Shadow Our beauty writer Rio Viera-Newton first learned about Hourglass\u2019s Scattered Light Eyeshadow in the shade Aura while watching a video on Rosie Huntington-Whitley\u2019s YouTube channel, but was shocked when she realized it cost $29 at Sephora, so she held off. Then, she went to Ulta: \u201cWhen I tried its $6 Super Shock Wave Eyeshadow in the shade \u2018Frog,\u2019 I gasped \u2014 really, I did! Just like the Aura, this shadow gave off a super-buildable, subtle but beautifully prismatic shimmer \u2014 something you could wear as easily to a meeting as you could on your actual wedding day.\u201d $6 at Ulta Beauty Buy\n\nThe kids\u2019 PJs that have the feel of Hanna Andersson\u2019s\n\nThe Zip Romper \u201cHanna Andersson offers great kids\u2019 pajamas and a lot of other great clothing, too,\u201d writes Steven John, and though the kids\u2019 PJs from Primary don\u2019t have the same fun prints, \u201cAfter a couple of washes, Primary cotton PJs are just as soft as Hannas. In fact, if I were going just by the feel, I might not be able to tell the difference.\u201d $15 at Primary Buy\n\nThe Dr. Martens that look like $820 Prada shoes (when they\u2019re polished)\n\nDr. Martens Mono 1461 \u201cTo be clear, I did not buy the Docs derbys (which are also available at Urban Outfitters and SSENSE) because I thought they looked like Prada. They honestly didn\u2019t remind me of Prada until I encountered myriad admirers who thought they were Prada,\u201d writes our columnist, and resident Cool Guy, Chris Black, before admitting, \u201cI think what really gets people assuming my Docs are Pradas is when I put them on after sending them for a serious polish at Cowboy Shoe Repair on Broome Street (the Docs come buffed, but I want to SHINE).\u201d $115 at Amazon Buy $120 at Zappos Buy\n\nThe Shark vacuum cleans as well as a Dyson\n\nShark APEX UpLight \u201cWhat could really be the difference between cleaning your apartment with a Shark instead of a Dyson?\u201d asks Margaret Rhodes. The answer: Not much. The Shark kept up with the Dyson in all of her tests, from vacuuming a low-pile Turkish rug to picking up a box of white sugar, and the Shark is a fraction of the price. $259 at Amazon Buy $259 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe $16 dupe for Tom Ford\u2019s (sold out) lip blush\n\nWinky Lux Flower Balm Tom Ford\u2019s Lip Blush is a clear lip balm with gold flakes in it \u201cthat, upon contact with your mouth, transforms into a flattering pink,\u201d says Or Gotham. It\u2019s also sold out everywhere. But Winky Lux\u2019s Flower Balm has a near-identical texture and effect, for just $16. \u201cSo if you\u2019re looking for the type of cosmetic that would make your enemies feel bad about themselves, there\u2019s really nothing quite like Tom Ford. However, since that option is currently really only available at a 100 percent markup on Amazon, you can find peace in knowing that there is Winky Lux.\u201d $16 at Ulta Beauty Buy $16 at Winky Lux Buy\n\nThe cheapest air purifier that works just as well as the second-cheapest one\n\nElechomes Air Purifier with True HEPA Filter The air purifier from Blueair that Steven John bought \u201cdoes a superlative job scrubbing the air clean in a space up to 430 square feet\u201d for $525; it\u2019s got three different air-speed settings and removes 99.97 percent of airborne pollutants. But so does this $200 Elechomes air purifier (though it only covers 350 square feet). $200 at Amazon Buy $200 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe Amazon fishing vest that looks high fashion\n\nKedera Men's Mesh Fishing Vest Robin Reetz was intrigued by \u201cthis $760 \u2018technical canvas tool vest\u2019 I saw on Need Supply Co. The luxury brand Ganni seemed to be doing something similar, albeit in shearling, and the look had also trickled down to Stussy.\u201d But instead of spending hundreds on this trendy vest, she turned to Amazon: \u201cIt seemed to have a slightly oversize fit, mesh panels, a Yeezy-esque neutral tone, and more pockets than I\u2019d know what to do with. At $20, I felt like I could afford to give it a shot. And I was right.\u201d $20 at Amazon Buy $20 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best beauty dupes, according to Rio\u2019s beauty-obsessed followers\n\nNIVEA Cr\u00e8me $16 (was $23, now 30% off) Rio Viera-Newton polled her beauty-obsessed Instagram followers to find the best beauty dupes, and they came prepared with tons of excellent recommendations, like this La Mer dupe. According to esthetician Sofie Pavitt, \u201cThe ingredient list is essentially identical (except La Mer has petrolatum). The only other big difference is La Mer has a lot of antioxidants. The seaweed alpha hydroxy acid in La Mer isn\u2019t, in my opinion, a reason to spend the extra money on it. I would just use the Nivea alongside a cheaper AHA exfoliating product.\u201d $16 for 3 at Amazon Buy $16 for 3 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe $30 sleeping bag that\u2019ll keep you as warm a $150 one\n\nSportneer Sleeping Bag 20F Ultralight Mummy Sleeping Bags Steven John owns seven sleeping bags, and his favorite is the Synthesis 20, from Sierra Designs, which costs $150. \u201cBut it\u2019s also surprisingly similar to one that costs just $30, the Sportneer 20F Ultralight Mummy Bag,\u201d he writes. They have a similar design, are nearly identical in weight, and \u201cfor the record, I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and I fit in both bags with ease, even with my head tucked into the hood, which can be cinched tight on both sacks.\u201d $30 at Amazon Buy $30 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe esthetician-grade (less expensive) beauty tools that you can buy on Amazon\n\nNuDerma High Frequency Skin Therapy Wand Machine Anna Zahn, L.A.-based lymphatic massage specialist and founder of the spa Ricari Studio, recommends many \u201cinexpensive gadgets you can use at home to replicate the results of pricey esthetician-grade or brand-name devices\u201d to her clients, and we found some of her favorites, including this less-expensive, at-home high-frequency electrical-current treatment. $40 at Amazon Buy $40 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe ceramic dishes from World Market that look Insta-famous\n\nBlush Element Dinner Plates, Set of 4 After lusting after Year & Day\u2019s blush-colored ceramics that she saw on Instagram, Kase Wickman found similar-looking dishware at World Market for a fraction of the price. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to go for a mix of the blush and stone pieces. I think they would look just darling on my Instagram \u2026 I mean, my table. On my table.\u201d $32 at World Market Buy\n\nThe drugstore concealer that hides dark circles as well as Cl\u00e9 de Peau\u2019s\n\nMaybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer $8 (was $10, now 20% off) Yes, Chloe Anello admits: Cl\u00e9 de Peau\u2019s $70 concealer is really good at hiding dark circles under her eyes. But so is Maybelline\u2019s Instant Age Rewind concealer: \u201cMy dark circles don\u2019t creep through midday, and if I ever need a rare quick touch-up, it\u2019s just a refresher; I\u2019m not starting over as if I never applied anything to begin with. Plus I can feel more liberal in applying the stuff \u2014 I can purchase seven of them for the price of one Cl\u00e9 de Peau.\u201d $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe ecofriendly laundry detergent that costs 17 cents per pod\n\nUnscented Dropps Laundry Detergent Pods, 32 Count By switching to Dropps laundry detergent and dishwasher pods, Steven John estimates he and his family are \u201cdown to under $150 in combined annual laundry and dishwashing-soap expenses since we went the Dropps route. Plus, the pods come in 100 percent recyclable biodegradable cardboard packaging.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe best Le Creuset Dutch oven dupes\n\nCuisinart Chef's Classic Enameled Cast Iron 5-Quart Round Covered Casserole \u201cThe reason to spend $350 on a Le Creuset Dutch oven is because you want it all: a high-performing enameled cast-iron Dutch oven that has a long legacy and will still look great on your stove in basically any color that you want,\u201d writes managing editor Maxine Builder. \u201cBut if you\u2019re willing to compromise on any one of these features (something that many, many home cooks are!), you can still get a very good Dutch oven that, technically, does everything the Le Creuset does,\u201d and to find the best Le Creuset Dutch-oven dupes, she tested six options, including this Cuisinart, which she calls the best functional Le Creuset dupe. $71 at Amazon Buy $71 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe under-$50 mules a boss thought were No. 6\n\nVince Camuto Women's Stephena Wedge Sandal \u201cMy boss, the director of photography here at New York, is the type of person who serves sea urchin at her dinner parties,\u201d writes Graylen Gatewood, explaining, \u201cAnd so I guess it came as a bit of a shock last month when she glanced down at my feet and asked \u2014 in a way like she didn\u2019t really need to ask \u2014 if the slides I was wearing were No. 6.\u201d In fact, she was wearing these Vince Camuto wedge sandals, which she bought on Amazon. From $34 at Amazon Buy From $34 at Amazon Buy\n\nThe European-style vegan butter that tastes like real butter\n\nMiyoko\u2019s European-Style Cultured Vegan Butter \u201cUnlike Earth Balance, which is, in my opinion, thoughtfully branded margarine, Miyoko\u2019s is made out of real ingredients like coconut oil and cultured cashews (which gives it a great tang that\u2019s slightly more intense than cultured butter\u2019s and makes me think it\u2019s good for my gut health),\u201d explains Katheryn Erickson. It\u2019s expensive, even when compared to fancy conventional butter, but she notes, \u201cmy Alabama-born best friend, who knows a thing or two about butter, was fooled into eating Miyoko\u2019s for months by his health-freak boyfriend and was none the wiser. It\u2019s just that good.\u201d $8 at Instacart Buy\n\nBuzz Bissinger\u2019s favorite drugstore skin-care dupes\n\nOlay Mist Cooling Ultimate Hydration Essence \u201cI am a skin-care price whore,\u201d admits our beauty columnist Buzz Bissinger. But he\u2019s started thinking of his $80 La Mer facial spray as \u201cfine wine, only to be used on special occasions.\u201d So for everyday use, he turns to this Olay mist. \u201cIt only features some 17 ingredients \u2014 my favorites being the white mint and refreshing cucumber water, which makes it feel slightly more bracing \u2014 but goes on effortlessly and is just as easy to carry around, as its bottle is basically the same size.\u201d $10 at Amazon Buy $10 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
