Friday\u2019s demonstration is expected to be a smaller protest, the coalition said.\n\n\u201cHaving motorists sit for four or five hours, the emissions from that are a blip compared to the emissions that are going to be spewed into the atmosphere if we let the crisis go on,\u201d said a spokesperson with the Coalition to Shutdown DC. \u201cYes, that is a criticism we are aware of it is an insignificant drop in a vast, vast ocean.\u201d\n\nBut John Townsend, spokesman for the car owners club AAA Mid-Atlantic, pointed to studies showing that cars running at 5 mph produce twice as much carbon dioxide as those operating at 35 mph.\n\n\u201cSo this form of protest actually increases greenhouse gas emissions, exactly what we are trying to prevent,\u201d Mr. Townsend said in an email.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he noted that Monday\u2019s protesters chose \u201csome of the busiest intersections\u201d in the city, whose roads already are over capacity for traffic.\n\nThe District sees 1.9 million vehicle trips every day and has the third worst gridlock in the country after Los Angeles and San Francisco, he added.\n\n\u201cProtests like this, especially when it impacts an intersection, underscores the fragility of our transportation system,\u201d Mr. Townsend said.\n\nThe Coalition to Shutdown D.C. is made up of various groups, including Black Lives Matter DMV, Labor Network for Sustainability, Metro DMV Democratic Socialists of America, Movement for a People\u2019s Party, Rising Tide North America, Sunrise Movement DC, and Werk for Peace and World Beyond War.\n\nThe coalition said it is aiming to raise awareness of climate change and is asking political leaders to:\n\n\u2981 Take action to halt all fossil fuel extraction and transition to 100% renewable energy by 2030\n\n\u2981 Respect land sovereignty of indigenous peoples.\n\n\u2981 Invest in restoring impoverished communities adversely affected by climate change.\n\n\u2981 Protect and restore biodiversity\n\n\u2981 Implement sustainable farming practices.\n\nMetropolitan Police arrested 26 people during Monday\u2019s protest for obstructing a roadway, all of whom were released that day because they either paid a fine to waive the citation or did not pay a fine and have a court date next week, a department spokesperson said in an email.\n\nU.S. Capital Police arrested six protesters.\n\nThe city government is encouraging commuters Friday to take alternate routes to work, use public transit and to sign up for AlertDC traffic notifications.\n\nMr. Townsend suggested working from home, if possible, as well.\n\nClimate activists should rethink their tactics and focus their protests on the people responsible for U.S. inaction \u2014 the President and Congress \u2014 not the innocent working people of the Washington Region, who have enough trouble getting to work as it is,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cNext time, stay off the main commuter routes, and if you must, focus protests around the White House and the Capitol where the problem resides.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
