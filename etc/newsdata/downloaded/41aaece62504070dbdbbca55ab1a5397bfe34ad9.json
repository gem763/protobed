Players need to look quickly, though; after a few moments, the individual flees. Thankfully, recording software is a thing and YouTubers and games sites have footage of the sneaky hacker.\n\nIt remains to be seen if and when Crypto will be added to Apex Legends. These small teases resemble the lead up to a hero in another game: Overwatch. The snarky hacker Sombra was the subject of an extended alternate reality campaign that forced players to dig through website code and complete other tasks to learn more.\n\nIt took a long time before Sombra showed up in the game.
