On one hand, Donald Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser has been subpoenaed by Congress to testify about discussions surrounding Ukraine-Gate. On the other, his boss has claimed that the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry is invalid and that executive privilege prevails over Adam Schiff\u2019s ad hoc hearings. At stake is a contempt citation if Kupperman doesn\u2019t comply.\n\nKupperman chose not to show up for his scheduled deposition, but he\u2019s hoping Schiff et al will accept a sick note from a federal judge:\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s former deputy national security adviser Charles Kupperman defied a congressional subpoena Monday, failing to appear for a closed-door deposition before House impeachment investigators and throwing a new hurdle into Democrats\u2019 plans to quickly gather evidence in their inquiry. Kupperman filed a lawsuit on Friday asking a judge to rule whether he had to comply with the House subpoena, given the White House\u2019s stance that the impeachment inquiry is illegitimate. Kupperman\u2019s attorney, Charles Cooper, argued that his client was caught between competing demands between the Executive and Legislative branches and needed the courts to rule before Kupperman would testify.\n\nSchiff isn\u2019t inclined to wait around. He claimed that the court would \u201cmake short shrift\u201d of the argument, but in the meantime the House isn\u2019t inclined to wait around. Schiff announced that his committee would next consider a contempt charge against Kupperman:\n\nSchiff says that Kupperman's delay tactics may warrant contempt proceedings pic.twitter.com/Kl0lMSeenQ \u2014 TPM Livewire (@TPMLiveWire) October 28, 2019\n\nReps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows argued that this reaction showed that the \u201cinquiry\u201d was nothing of the sort. It\u2019s a \u201csham,\u201d Meadows argued, that should be brought to a close, while Jordan told the press that Kupperman was willing to testify if a judge so ordered it.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the rush is in this case. Kupperman clearly has resort to the judiciary when caught in such a vise, at least to make sure his own rights are protected. If the court will \u201cmake short shrift\u201d of the argument, why not let it? In fact, it\u2019s almost certain that courts will make short shrift of it, as one did late last week in dispensing with Trump\u2019s argument that the House has to formally vote to open an impeachment inquiry before being able to compel testimony.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s nothing to suggest that Kupperman\u2019s attempt to access due process is either contemptuous of Congress or obstructive of its ends, as Schiff also alleged today. It\u2019s not as if this will hold up an impeachment vote, which isn\u2019t scheduled in any case, or even public hearings, which also have yet to be scheduled. It\u2019s a deposition, as Schiff and other Democrats keep reminding everyone, a preliminary step before going forward with an impeachment hearing. They still have time to depose Kupperman after courts \u201cmake short shrift\u201d of the administration\u2019s argument.\n\nWhy rush to a contempt citation? Schiff himself said that House Democrats are tiring of the White House\u2019s legal strategy of using the courts to slow down the process, but again, presidents have the right to argue against potentially abusive use of subpoena power in regard to executive privilege, too. Democrats want to wrap up an impeachment before Thanksgiving, however, and fighting the administration in court over privilege might add months to that schedule, even if they win \u2014 which seems likely in this instance, but not necessarily assured.\n\nThat\u2019s the real problem for Schiff. The longer impeachment drags out, the more voters will wonder why it\u2019s necessary when Trump will have to run for re-election anyway. That threatens the standing of two dozen House Democrats who won election in Trump-friendly districts in 2018, where losses over Schiff\u2019s chaotic stampede to impeachment might mean losing control of the chamber in 2021. Schiff started a process that Nancy Pelosi can\u2019t afford to see through to the end if they play by the rules, and so Schiff\u2019s trying to bully people out of their due process. Kupperman, for now, isn\u2019t playing along, even if he might end up being a not-sympathetic witness to Trump.", "description": "Due process?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/schiff-kupperman.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
