Only one counted \u2013 a 61st minute penalty.\n\nWolves' Raul Jiminez stepped up and fired low past Angus Gunn, his third goal of the season\n\nOn two other occasions in the first half. VAR came to the rescue of a Southampton team desperate to end a losing run. For these were two teams enjoying contrasting fortunes at Molinueux.\n\nWolves are very much in the ascendancy \u2013 three successive wins including a memorable win at champions Manchester City just three days after a Europa League win against all the odds in Turkey against Besiktas.\n\nThat followed a first Premier League win of the season against Watford. Wolves have not looked back since.\n\nFormer Liverpool striker Danny Ings broke the deadlock after 53 minutes\n\nThe spectacular rise of the Nino Spirito Santos outfit has benn matched by the alarming decline of Southampton.\n\nThree defeats in the Premier League against Bournemouth, Tottenham and Chelsea have left manager Ralph Hasenhuttl a worried man. And rightl so.\n\nWhile Wolves are on a run, Southampton are in a rut. Falling down, as they say, is the easy bit. It is getting back up that is the hard part.\n\nVAR came to the rescue of a Southampton, twice denying Raul Jimenez before he scored\n\nAnd the pressure was on the Austrian and his men before a ball was kicked. Everton\u2019s 2-0 win over a West Ham team with another bout of travel sickness meant Southampton dropped into the relegation zone. Just what Hassenhutl did not need.\n\nNathan Redmond showed early zip and zest for Southampton who now had a real target at which to aim \u2013 a place outside the bottom three. But Wolves are now a confident team on the back of their recent successes.\n\nRaul Jimenez was a handful for Jannick Vstergaard and company and Joao Moutinho was a willing support from midfield.\n\nAnd such was the fear instilled into Southampton by Wolves\u2019 sheer pace that Yan Valery was booked for a crude 10th minute hack on Jonny.\n\nAfter 42 minutes, Jimenez struck a second only to be frustrated again by VAR, goal didn't stand\n\nDanny Ings briefly relieved the pressure with low shot that tested Rui Patricio at his near post.\n\nBut a more major concern for Wolves was the injury suffered by Ryan Bennett who needed extensive treatment for a thigh pull. He was unable to continue and was replaced by Jesus Vallejo.\n\nRedmond continued to pose the major threat to Wolves with his pace and ability to cross on the run and he inspired a much-needed spell of Southampton pressure.\n\nPierre-Emile Hojbjerg capitalised on slack play from Ruben Neves before referee Peter Bankes ruled out a Jimenez strike for handball \u2013 confirmed by a VAR check and a that brought a yellow card for the Mexican.\n\nNathan Redmond was the best player on the pitch on the day, seen here rounding Vallejo\n\nBut after 42 minutes, Jimenez struck again only to be frustrated again by VAR \u2013 this time for offside against Patrick Cutrone for offside in the build-up.\n\nWolves lost the influential Neves at half-time through injury \u2013 and they almost lost a goal in the first minute of the second half as Vallejo casually passed to Ings and Patricio saved the shot.\n\nThere was no reprieve in the 53rd minute, however, when Ings capitalised on a monumental mistake. A through ball appeared to hold little threat but the otherwise immaculate Conor Coady misjudged the bounce to give Ings a run at goal that he took without hesitation.\n\nJust the lifeline Southampton needed.\n\nThen came the break Wolves needed. Matt Doherty eluded every challenge except Hojbjerg\u2019s and down he went. Penalty given, a VAR check gave the green light and for Jimenez it was the third time he had the ball in the net. This one, however, counted.\n\nWolves have made Hi Ho Silver Lining their anthem. But it was Hassenhutil who found his as Southampton moved out of the bottom three.", "description": "STEPHEN STAMMERS AT MOLINEUX:Former Liverpool striker Danny Ings broke the deadlock after 53 minutes before Wolves' Raul Jiminez scored a penalty to level the scores.", "authors": ["Stephen Stammers For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/16/19929684-0-image-a-14_1571500349100.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
