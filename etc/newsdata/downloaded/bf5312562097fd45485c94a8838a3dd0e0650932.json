I was surprised yesterday when Trump responded to impeachment rumblings in the House by promising to release the transcript of his call with Zelensky, a key Pelosi demand. I was more surprised last night when reports started swirling that he would also share the whistleblower complaint, the other document Dems have insisted on seeing. It\u2019s not like Trump to accede to threats in a big spot when he knows his base is watching closely. \u201cHe fights!\u201d, remember? I thought he\u2019d declare war by telling Pelosi that she\u2019s not getting either document because they\u2019re protected by executive privilege and that she could sue him if she didn\u2019t like it.\n\nInstead he forked one item over and allegedly is preparing to transmit the other one. Why?\n\nThis might be why. Joseph Maguire, the acting DNI and the man who\u2019s momentarily in possession of the whistleblower complaint, reportedly threatened to resign if the White House refused to let him speak to Congress tomorrow as scheduled without formally asserting privilege. That threat probably spooked Trump and his aides by making them think they were about to lose control of the situation. There are now three key players in the natsec community who are antagonistic towards them, after all: Maguire, who knows what\u2019s in the complaint; the whistleblower himself, who may be in the process of coming forward; and of course John Bolton, who knows all sorts of things about the Trump White House\u2019s handling of foreign affairs. Trump may have concluded that trying to block Maguire would have only further antagonized those three and ended up failing if/when Maguire decided to start talking anyway.\n\nBetter to pretend that the White House is still in control by \u201callowing\u201d Maguire to testify than to try to restrain him ineffectually and trigger a sensational media narrative about Trump\u2019s own natsec people rebelling against him.\n\nThe acting Director of National Intelligence threatened to resign over concerns that the White House might attempt to force him to stonewall Congress when he testifies Thursday about an explosive whistleblower complaint about the president, according to current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter\u2026 The officials said that Joseph Maguire, who was thrust into the top intelligence post last month, warned the White House that he was not willing to withhold information from Congress, where he is scheduled to testify in open and closed hearings on Thursday\u2026 In essence, Maguire was serving notice that he intended to cooperate with lawmakers unless the White House moved forward with a legal case to prevent him from doing so, the officials said\u2026 He has at times expressed his displeasure to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and others that the White House had put him in the untenable position of denying the material to Congress over a claim that it did not fall within his jurisdiction as leader of the intelligence community.\n\nAt the White House\u2019s behest, Maguire had been stuck arguing lately that even though the law requires him to turn over to Congress any \u201curgent\u201d whistleblower complaint filed by an intelligence official, he doesn\u2019t need to turn this one over because the complaint deals with Trump and Trump technically isn\u2019t part of the \u201cintelligence community.\u201d That was a hard argument to maintain and evidently Maguire was no longer inclined to maintain it. So the White House relented and Maguire will testify tomorrow as scheduled \u2014 now, thanks to this WaPo story, with *lots* of questions to come from House Democrats about what sort of pressure he felt from higher-ups to bottle up the complaint.\n\nMaguire, by the way, is a decorated veteran, having risen to vice admiral in the Navy and commanded SEAL Team Two for a few years before joining the natsec bureaucracy. Between his ultimatum on this and Mattis\u2019s resignation over Syria, Team Trump has had a tougher time getting former military officers to bend to its will. Trump likes being surrounded by generals \u2014 they symbolize strength to him \u2014 but I wonder if he\u2019ll think twice about appointing servicemen to bureaucratic vacancies going forward. If he had had a crony as acting DNI, he wouldn\u2019t be in this jam vis-a-vis Maguire right now.\n\nFor the record, the White House insists this is all fake news:\n\nThis is actually not true. And we would have gone on the record to say that if the @washingtonpost had given us more than 6 minutes (literally) to respond. https://t.co/5EBnBlShbK \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) September 25, 2019\n\nAs I write this, news is breaking that we might get to see that whistleblower complaint sooner than we think. According to Devin Nunes, Maguire\u2019s office is sending the complaint over to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees within the hour, at 4 p.m. ET. Whether it\u2019ll leak tonight is unclear, but certainly the details will be addressed in tomorrow\u2019s hearing with Maguire. Stay tuned.\n\nRep. @DevinNunes: \"At 4 o'clock this afternoon, in fact, the DNI is going to transmit the complaint to the Intelligence Committee spaces.\" Full video: https://t.co/2gInkbZePo pic.twitter.com/ldkjecPBv2 \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) September 25, 2019\n\nUpdate: Interesting \u2014 now Maguire himself is denying that he threatened to resign.\n\nADNI MAGUIRE STATEMENT: \u201cAt no time have I considered resigning my position since assuming this role on Aug. 16, 2019.
