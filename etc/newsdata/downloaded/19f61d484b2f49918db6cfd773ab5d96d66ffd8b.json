One drawback of having friends who are as frightfully clever as you are is that they know your tricks and can suss out your bullshit, so once in a while, you\u2019ll find yourself with nowhere to go. That\u2019s what happens to Alaska in this episode, and it\u2019s painful to watch.\n\nThere\u2019s a bunch of heartbreak in this episode, actually, and it\u2019s not all Alaska\u2019s, though she is responsible for much of it. In one way or another, everyone is feeling alienated from their sangha, and consequently, all the alliances and relationships we\u2019ve gotten to know earlier are on rocky ground.\n\nAlthough the truce with the Weekend Warriors remains in effect, the Colonel can\u2019t quite let go of the prank war. He keeps worrying at it like a bad mosquito bite, taunting the Weekend Warriors here and there, and letting off steam by indulging in a subcategory of pranks that he knows won\u2019t land him in any real trouble: getting himself kicked out of Culver Creek basketball games. He does so with style and consistency, using a mix of rhyming taunts and game-disrupting physical comedy (including sinking one particularly graceful three-pointer) to continue his streak.\n\nBut doubts about the truce linger, and matters come to a head at the Halloween game against Harsden, the school Alaska\u2019s former roommate Marya and Paul transferred to after being expelled. They\u2019ve puzzled out that Alaska must have ratted on them, since she was the only one who knew about their drinking/smoking/boning plans. When Takumi confronts Alaska about the allegation, she tries to play it off and then pivots to her usual winning distraction strategy of extreme flirtatiousness, peeling Pudge\u2019s shirt off him with such care and slowness that it really seems like they\u2019re about to smooch. Then she thinks better of it and instead starts to iron his shirt and offer him advice for his first date that evening with Lara.\n\nTakumi suggests Alaska stay away from the game, given the confrontation that\u2019s likely to happen if she tries to talk to Paul or Marya, but Alaska, clad in a pretty resplendent Stevie Nicks costume, acts like everything is totally normal, calling out and waving to Marya, who studiously ignores Alaska before loudly accusing her of ratting.\n\nThe game has gone badly \u2014 the Colonel\u2019s heckling results in Pudge sustaining a concussion after being slammed in the face with a ball by one of the Harsden players, leading Harsden to forfeit \u2014 and Lara winds up driving Pudge to the hospital in a green limo owned by her dad\u2019s car-service company. They have a real conversation for once, and without Alaska there to soak up all of Pudge\u2019s attention, he realizes what a thoughtful and interesting person Lara is.\n\nBack on campus, the Colonel\u2019s deep bonds with Sara, Takumi, and Alaska are being tested. Sara and Takumi can\u2019t understand why he won\u2019t accept the idea that Alaska has ratted. Takumi\u2019s response is to leave the Colonel alone with his thoughts, but Sara draws a harder line, announcing that if he can\u2019t acknowledge that Alaska broke Culver Creek\u2019s most fundamental unofficial rule, she\u2019s ending their relationship.\n\nAfter brushing off Lara\u2019s offer to stay in her room so she can keep an eye on his concussion (an offer based equally in kindness and horniness), Pudge witnesses Alaska and the Eagle having a heated conversation at the Eagle\u2019s house. Alaska, still in costume, but with her makeup and hair wrecked following an evening of partying and despair at her boyfriend Jake\u2019s college, begs the Eagle for help out of her predicament, and though he\u2019s not unsympathetic, they see the situation from fundamentally irreconcilable points of view. He\u2019s there to enforce the rules, they both know she\u2019s broken them, and she\u2019s stuck. Alaska can\u2019t face losing her scholarship, going home, and being \u201cstuck there, in that house, forever\u201d with her father. The Eagle advises her, as gently and clearly as he can, to learn to live with being called a rat and reconcile herself to a more difficult social reality at Culver Creek.\n\nThe adults in this adaptation are authority figures, but the scripts and the actors\u2019 nuanced performances are giving them incrementally more space to be nearly as well rounded as the teen protagonists. The Eagle has an especially hard line to walk as a genuinely caring hard-ass, and Timothy Simons makes the most of his height and expressive face to convey both his total intolerance for shenanigans of all kinds and the heartbreak over his dissolving marriage that leaks out of him at the slightest provocation.\n\nThe scenes in the hospital tantalize us by giving veteran character actor Ron Cephas Jones the opportunity to do a bit more with his role as the wisdom-dispensing comparative-religion teacher Dr. Hyde. Seeing Pudge and Lara outside of their usual classroom context, particularly as he rolls past them in a wheelchair, puts all three characters in a more vulnerable situation, and so the wisdom Dr. Hyde does dispense \u2014 urging them again to be fully present, because \u201csmall moments forge deep bonds\u201d \u2014 is more resonant for it.\n\nAs the episode closes, here\u2019s how things stand in all of the show\u2019s various relationships:\n\n\u2022 Marya and Paul have friend-dumped Alaska.\n\n\u2022 Alaska may have broken up with Jake (though it\u2019s unclear if he knows that).\n\n\u2022 Takumi and the Colonel have broken up with Alaska and aren\u2019t 100 percent thrilled with each other, either. Pudge\u2019s awareness of the situation is a little ambiguous, but he knows something\u2019s up.\n\n\u2022 Sara has broken up with the Colonel.\n\n\u2022 Pudge has perhaps thrown away his shot with Lara.\n\n\u2022 Kevin and Longfellow are still rock solid, which is frankly a huge relief, as the ability of either of them to function outside their little unit of high-status codependency is very much in doubt.\n\nThe concluding title card reads, ominously \u201c43 Days Before.\u201d I prefer not to, I really do.\n\nFamous Last Words\n\n\u2022 This episode opens with an homage to Rushmore. It also features an impeccable nod to the costuming in The Royal Tenenbaums, pulling double duty as a little Easter egg and as a plot-driver in the scenes at the college rager Alaska attends with Jake and his friend Fiona. Episode one included a few Wes Anderson touches, too, but if there were any in episode two, I missed them. I\u2019ll keep you posted on others as they appear!\n\n\u2022 Musical Cue of the Episode: \u201cThe Way You Move\u201d and \u201cThe Monster Mash\u201d are excellent choices, but I\u2019m giving it to Young Summer\u2019s agonizingly sad cover of \u201cTake Me Out\u201d (originally recorded in a jaunty militaristic march by Franz Ferdinand), which plays over Alaska\u2019s grim trudging back to her room, now emblazoned with \u201cRAT\u201d in spray paint, courtesy of the Colonel.", "description": "In the wake of the prank war and truce, the Colonel\u2019s deep bonds with Sara, Takumi, and Alaska are tested.
