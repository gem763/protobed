It was the first time in a century that the Christian communities in the region were forced to take shelter from a Turkish attack.\n\nThe Syriac-Assyrians and Armenians of northeast Syria have been divided on their feelings towards the Kurdish-led, U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Council (SDC) that took control of the area after the defeat of ISIS. But they remain united against the prospect of a war between Turkey and the Kurds, which is now beginning to wreak havoc on their homeland.\n\n\u201cThey want to finish the job started a hundred years ago in the Seyfo,\u201d said Bassam Ishak, using a Syriac-language term for the 1915 genocide of Christians in present-day Turkey. \u201cThere is a solidarity among Syriacs and Assyrian political parties in condemning the attack, because of the history, for one thing, and second, because nobody wants to see a neighboring country come and attack their homes and force them out.\u201d\n\nIshak, an SDC diplomat of Syriac-Assyrian origin, said that indigenous Christian ethnic groups used to be one-third of northeast Syria\u2019s population, but many left during the Arab nationalist regimes of the twentieth century. There are no reliable statistics today, but Ishak estimates that there are only forty or fifty thousand Syriac-Assyrians left in the region.\n\nIn February 2015, ISIS attacked the Khabour Valley, destroying churches and taking hundreds of Syriac-Assyrians hostages. According to the Assyrian Policy Institute, the campaign \u201ceffectively end[ed] the Assyrian presence in the Khabour Region.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Assyrians, history is repeating itself\u2014again and again. That realization is crippling for a people that has experienced immense suffering and is still affected by the lasting consequences of the events of 1915,\u201d said Assyrian Policy Institute director Reine Hanna.\n\nEuropean Syriac Union member David Vergili told the National Interest that Syriac-Assyrian villagers in the border region are now fleeing for al-Hassaka and the southern neighborhoods of al-Qamishli, two cities founded by survivors of the 1915 genocide. (Syriac-Assyrians sometimes refer to al-Qamishli as Beth-Zalin.) \u201cIf the conflict continues in this way, I'm sure that the Syriac people will also leave these big cities,\u201d Vergili said.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Turkey plans to use the Syrian National Army, an alliance of Islamist rebels, for its operations in Northern Syria.", "authors": ["Matthew Petti"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bN0VQ00ruHnbmwBdxLefLA--~B/aD05Nzg7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/926b0d3236e0e284f029286e8352d777", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
