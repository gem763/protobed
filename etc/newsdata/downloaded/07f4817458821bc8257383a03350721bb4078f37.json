Since then nearly 400 women have come forward with allegations of misconduct and battery against Tyndall. However, the current criminal charges against the 72-year-old stem from accusations of abuse by 16 women who say Tyndall performed medically unnecessary physical exams, touched them inappropriately, photographed their genitals and that he made inappropriate comments about their bodies.\n\nTyndall eventually left USC in 2017, and although he was still under investigation \u2014 one that turned up complaints against the doctor dating as far back as 2000 \u2014 he exited with a secret payout and a clean record from the medical board.\n\nIn October 2018, the university agreed to $215-million federal class-action settlement with former patients.\n\nThe move by Tyndall on Monday is not an admission of guilt. He maintains his innocence and denies any wrongdoing, asserting that \"his exams were in keeping with the standards outlined by textbooks and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\"", "description": "\"On behalf of California consumers, the Board achieved the highest level of patient protection with the surrender of [George] Tyndall's license,\" the California Medical Board executive director said.", "authors": ["Vanessa Romo"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/09/10/ap_19252840366916_wide-95e3119d6a4004d76403a0f6e8527449c07de762.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
