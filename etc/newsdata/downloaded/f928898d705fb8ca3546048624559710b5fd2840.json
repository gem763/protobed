The roundup was believed to be an attempt to discourage participation in an Aug. 31 march planned by the Civil Human Rights Front, a coalition of pro-democracy groups that has organized several mass rallies this summer.\n\nPolice continued the crackdown on Tuesday morning with several more arrests. Demosisto\u2019s chairperson, Ivan Lam, who had been out of Hong Kong over the weekend, was detained on arrival at the city\u2019s airport, according to the party.\n\nStudent leader Keith Fong was also arrested in the early hours of Tuesday, on theft charges that the Baptist University student union claimed were \u201cfabricated\u201d by police. Activist Michael Mo was also arrested on Tuesday morning, according to local media, and charged on suspicion of organizing an illegal assembly.\n\nThe round-up followed a day of student strikes and another night of unrest in the city, with protesters clashing with police outside the offices of Hong Kong\u2019s embattled top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam. Late on Monday night, Demosisto\u2019s vice chairperson Isaac Cheng, was attacked by three men, according to a spokesperson for the party.\n\nProtests have gripped Hong Kong since early June, sparked by the government\u2019s proposal of a bill that would have allowed China to request fugitives be sent to the mainland to face trial in Communist Party controlled courts. Although the bill is now suspended, the movement has snowballed into a wider campaign for greater political freedom, with some protesters calling for self-determination or independence for Hong Kong.", "description": "The head of the Hong Kong Court Prosecutors Association accuses police of lying, government funded broadcaster says", "authors": ["Amy Gunia", "Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pJOuMFQGzI70Qlp2dvMfHA--~B/aD0yNjY3O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/9f3e745e2acf1cd2288fdf20d5363673"}
