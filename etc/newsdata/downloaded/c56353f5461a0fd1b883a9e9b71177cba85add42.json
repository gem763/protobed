He said he heard what sounded like \"two people meeting by surprise\" and then two gunshots.\n\nBrown, who became emotional at times and used his T-shirt and tissue to wipe his tears, said he had met Jean, a 26-year-old accountant from the Caribbean island nation of St. Lucia, for the first time earlier that day.\n\nGuyger, 31, was fired from the department soon after the shooting. She was convicted Tuesday and sentenced the next day to 10 years in prison.", "description": "A witness in the murder trial of a white Dallas police officer who fatally shot her black neighbor has been killed in a shooting, the Dallas Morning News reported, citing authorities.", "authors": ["Associated Press", "Julie Burchill", "Cal Revely-Calder", "Lucy Denyer", "Daniel Hannan", "Erin Baker"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/06/TELEMMGLPICT000212152439-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqiUuvBizZT2q34Osm0tNw3X0aGPApSYsoTfgejYXeyQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
