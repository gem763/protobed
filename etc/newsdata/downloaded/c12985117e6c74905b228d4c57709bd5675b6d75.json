His LNEI group owns a package of media outlets including Les Inrocks magazine and radio stations.\n\nIn 2010, he also helped refinance France\u2019s centre-left daily newspaper Le Monde, along with other investors.\n\nHe sold some of his stake last year to billionaire Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky, sparking fears at the paper over its editorial independence.\n\nIn September, around 500 writers, artists and activists including US whistleblower Edward Snowden and novelist Salman Rushdie signed an open letter of support for journalists seeking guarantees.\n\nPigasse and other investors signed an agreement later the same month to allay those concerns.\n\nWhile Lazard praised Pigasse\u2019s role at the bank in its statement Sunday, some news reports have suggested there were tensions between Pigasse and other senior executives at the bank.\n\nFrance\u2019s investigative website Mediapart reported on Wednesday that Pigasse was on the way out. Lazard chief executive Ken Jacob had decided on an impromptu visit to Paris from Sunday to Tuesday to finalise Pigasse\u2019s departure, it reported.\n\nLazard France said in its statement Sunday that a new management team for its French operation would be announced shortly.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 French investment banker Matthieu Pigasse, a major shareholder in France\u2019s Le Monde newspaper, is to resign his executive", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/8c8660_matthieu-pigasse-pictured-2012-chairman-chief-executive-investment-bank-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
