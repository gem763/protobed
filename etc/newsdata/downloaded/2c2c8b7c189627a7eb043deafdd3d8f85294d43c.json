(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump announced Monday that he will authorize heavy economic sanctions against \u201ccurrent and former officials of the Government of Turkey\u201d following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria and Turkey\u2019s subsequent military offensive into the region.\n\nStatement from President Donald J. Trump Regarding Turkey\u2019s Actions in Northeast Syria pic.twitter.com/ZCQC7nzmME \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2019\n\nThe move follows heavy criticism of the president\u2019s decision to withdraw. White House sanctions were first announced last Friday during comments from Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, which he confirmed Monday, suggesting Trump\u2019s decision was imminent.\n\n\u201cTurkey\u2019s military offensive is endangering civilians and threatening peace, security, and stability in the region,\u201d Trump\u2019s statement reads. \u201cI have been perfectly clear with President Erdogan: Turkey\u2019s action is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes. . . . Unfortunately, Turkey does not appear to be mitigating the humanitarian effects of its invasion.\u201d The sanctions include an increase of steel tariffs up to 50 percent, as well as an end to negotiations meant to secure a $100 billion trade deal with Turkey.\n\nTrump ended the statement by reiterating his plan to withdraw remaining U.S. forces from northeast Syria, with only a \u201csmall footprint\u201d of troops to remain in southern Syria in order to \u201cprevent a repeat of 2014, when the neglected threat of ISIS raged across Syria and Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes hours after Senator Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and House speaker Nancy Pelosi jointly announced bipartisan support for tough sanctions on Turkey as punishment for its invasion.", "description": "President Trump announced Monday that he will authorize heavy economic sanctions against \u201ccurrent and former officials of the Government of Turkey\u201d following the withdrawal of U.S. troops from northern Syria and Turkey\u2019s subsequent military offensive into the region.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "John Mccormack", "John Hirschauer", "Andrew C.
