(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWe learned late Monday that President Trump ordered the withholding of military aid to Ukraine about one week before his phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25. It\u2019s a detail that will add to questions about whether Trump was tying the aid to the eastern European country investigating former vice president Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nA whistleblower complaint alleges that someone \u2014 apparently Trump \u2014 might have made an inappropriate \u201cpromise\u201d to a foreign leader. Trump has denied this, but he has admitted to discussing the Bidens with Zelensky on that call, and he has suggested that it would be okay for him to withhold money from a country that doesn\u2019t root out \u201ccorruption.\u201d\n\nThe situation has Democrats inching closer to impeachment of Trump, whom they accuse of leveraging his office for personal political gain.\n\nWith everything evolving quickly, we\u2019ve put together the following timeline. It will be updated as needed.\n\n2014-2015\n\nFeb. 22, 2014. Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych is ousted from power during a popular uprising in the country. He flees to Russia. Yanukovych came to power with the assistance of political consultant Paul Manafort, who worked for Yanukovych\u2019s Party of Regions.\n\nAfter his ouster, Ukrainian officials begin a wide-ranging investigation into corruption in the country.\n\nMay 13, 2014. Hunter Biden, the son of then-Vice President Joe Biden, joins the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. It is owned by oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, one of several subjects of the Ukrainian corruption probe.\n\nSept. 24, 2015. The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, blasts Ukraine Prosecutor General Viktor Shokin in a speech in Odessa, Ukraine. He points to a \u201cglaring problem\u201d that threatens the good work regional leaders are doing: \u201cthe failure of the institution of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine to successfully fight internal corruption.\"\n\n\u201cThe United States stands behind those who challenge these bad actors,\u201d Pyatt adds.\n\nDec. 8, 2015. In Kiev, Biden tells Ukrainian leaders to fire Shokin or lose more than $1 billion in loan guarantees. Biden joins many Western leaders in urging Shokin\u2019s ouster.\n\n2016\n\nFeb. 10, 2016. The International Monetary Fund threatens to halt a bailout program for Ukraine unless the country addresses its corruption issues.\n\nMarch 29, 2016. Shokin is ousted from his position by Ukraine\u2019s parliament.\n\nThe same day, Manafort is hired by Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to help in securing Republican National Convention delegates.\n\nMay 12, 2016. Yuriy Lutsenko becomes prosecutor general of Ukraine, replacing Shokin.\n\nJune 20, 2016. Manafort becomes the head of Trump\u2019s campaign after campaign manager Corey Lewandowski is fired.\n\nAug. 14, 2016. Ukrainian officials reveal the existence of a handwritten ledger suggesting that Manafort had received off-the-books payments from Yanukovych\u2019s political party to the tune of millions of dollars. These payments are ultimately part of criminal charges filed against Manafort in the United States.\n\nAug. 19, 2016. Manafort is fired from Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nNov. 8, 2016. Donald Trump is elected president.\n\n2017\u20142018\n\nJan. 12, 2017. Probes of Burisma are finalized and closed, according to the company, though Lutsenko later tells Bloomberg that one sale of an oil storage terminal will still be investigated.\n\nJan. 23, 2018. At an event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, Biden first describes the pressure he put on Ukraine\u2019s government.\n\n\u201cThey were walking out to a press conference. I said, \u2018nah, I\u2019m not going to \u2014 or, we\u2019re not going to give you the billion dollars.\u2019 They said, \u2018you have no authority. You\u2019re not the president. I said, call him,\u2019 \u201d Biden says. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re not getting the billion dollars.\u2019 I said, \u2018you\u2019re not getting the billion. I\u2019m going to be leaving here in, I think it was about six hours.\u2019 I looked at them and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b----, he got fired. And they put in place someone who was solid at the time.\u201d\n\nMay 2, 2018. The New York Times reports that Ukrainian officials had decided to halt assisting special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation out of concern that doing so would harm their relationship with Trump\u2019s administration.\n\n2019\n\nMarch 20. Lutsenko alleges U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gave him \u201ca list of people whom we should not prosecute,\u201d in an interview with the Hill. The State Department calls the claim an \u201coutright fabrication,\u201d but Trump promotes the story in a tweet.\n\n\u201cJohn Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades, Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges.\u201d @seanhannity @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 21, 2019\n\nApril. Hunter Biden\u2019s term as a board member ends, and he leaves Burisma.\n\nApril 18. Mueller releases his report detailing his team\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nLutsenko walks back his claim that Yovanovitch gave him a list of people not to prosecute.\n\nApril 21. Zelensky, a former TV comedian, is elected president of Ukraine with 73 percent of the vote. Trump calls him to offer his congratulations.\n\nMay 7. Yovanovitch is recalled by the State Department, two months before her scheduled departure date. Democrats allege a \u201cpolitical hit job\u201d aimed at creating a pretext to remove her.\n\nMay 9. Giuliani says he will travel to Ukraine to push for investigations \u201cbecause that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government.\u201d\n\nMay 11. Giuliani cancels his Ukraine trip amid a backlash over the propriety of a personal aide to the president seeking damaging information about a political opponent from a foreign government.\n\nMay 19. In an interview with Fox News, Trump explicitly references Biden\u2019s efforts in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cBiden, he calls them and says \u2018Don\u2019t you dare persecute, if you don\u2019t fire this prosecutor\u2019 \u2014 The prosecutor was after his son,\u201d Trump says. \u201cThen he said \u2018If you fire the prosecutor, you\u2019ll be okay. And if you don\u2019t fire the prosecutor, 'we\u2019re not giving you $2 billion in loan guarantees,\u2019 or whatever he was supposed to give. Can you imagine if I did that?\u201d\n\nAgain, the Burisma probe was dormant at the time, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials, and there was no evidence it focused on any actions by the Bidens.\n\nMay 20. Zelensky is inaugurated as president of Ukraine.\n\nMay 23. The administration notifies Congress that it intends to release aid money to Ukraine.\n\nJune 13. In an interview with ABC News\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Trump says that he might accept electoral assistance from a foreign government, if offered.\n\n\u201cI think you might want to listen, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening,\u201d Trump says. \u201cIf somebody called from a country, Norway, \u2018We have information on your opponent'? Oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d\n\nThe chairwoman of the Federal Election Commission subsequently points out on Twitter that this would be illegal.\n\nJuly 12. Axios reports that Trump and director of national intelligence Daniel Coats are at odds, with Trump telling confidantes that he wants to remove Coats from his position.\n\nJuly 16. Lutsenko says there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the Bidens.\n\nJuly 18. Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine is communicated to the State and Defense departments. Members of Congress are told that the hold is part of an \u201cinteragency delay.\u201d\n\nJuly 22. Shokin tells The Post that he was removed over the Biden issue.\n\n\u201cI will answer that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the [prosecutor general\u2019s office] investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation,\u201d he says. Other Ukrainian officials have cast doubt on this and said the investigation had long been dormant when Shokin was removed.\n\nJuly 24. Mueller testifies before Congress about his report and its findings.\n\nJuly 25. Trump and Zelensky speak on the phone. According to Post reporting, Trump repeatedly brings up Ukraine investigating the Bidens, but he reportedly does not bring up military or intelligence aid, indicating the call may not have included an explicit quid pro quo.\n\nJuly 28. Trump announces that Coats will resign in August.\n\nJuly 31. Trump holds a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call is first reported by the Russians; the White House doesn\u2019t confirm it until late that evening. The Russians, in a much more substantial readout than the United States, claim Trump and Putin spoke about restoring full relations one day.\n\nEarly August. At some point this month, Giuliani travels to Spain to meet with a representative of the Zelensky government. According to the New York Times, that meeting involved Giuliani\u2019s encouraging Zelensky\u2019s government to investigate Hunter Biden.\n\nAug. 3. Zelensky announces that he will travel to the United States to meet with Trump in Washington in September.\n\nAug. 8. Trump announces Joseph Maguire would take Coats\u2019s job as director of national intelligence (DNI) in an acting capacity. In doing so, he bypasses Sue Gordon, who had been Coats\u2019s No. 2 at the directorate of national intelligence and was a career intelligence official with bipartisan support. Gordon would later resign.\n\nAug. 12. An anonymous whistleblower files a complaint with the inspector general for the intelligence community. The contents of the whistleblower complaint are still secret. Intelligence community Inspector General Michael Atkinson will later determine the complaint to be credible and a matter of \u201curgent concern,\u201d triggering a legally required disclosure to the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nAug. 15. Coats and Gordon officially leave their positions.\n\nLate August. Lawmakers raise concerns about Ukraine aid being withheld, citing its importance to defend the former Soviet republic from Russia.\n\nSept. 1. Zelensky and Vice President Pence meet as various world leaders are in Poland for a ceremony commemorating World War II. Trump had originally been slated to attend the ceremony but remained in the United States to monitor Hurricane Dorian.\n\nSept. 2. Pence says he didn\u2019t discuss Biden with Zelensky, but that he did suggest that aid was contingent on rooting out corruption.\n\n\u201cAs President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption,\u201d Pence said. \u201cThe president wants to be assured that those resources are truly making their way to the kind of investments that will contribute to security and stability in Ukraine.\u201d\n\nEarly September. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) travels to Ukraine and meets with Zelensky. He later tells NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd that Zelensky had expressed concern about Giuliani\u2019s overtures.\n\nSept. 5. The Post editorial board writes that it had been \u201creliably told\u201d that Trump was \u201cattempting to force Mr. Zelensky to intervene in the 2020 U.S. presidential election by launching an investigation of the leading Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nSept. 9. Atkinson notifies the House and Senate intelligence committees that a whistleblower has filed a complaint, but he does not reveal its contents or substance.\n\nSept. 10. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) writes to Maguire demanding Congress receive the complaint.\n\nTrump announces on Twitter that national security adviser John Bolton has resigned. Trump says it came at his request; Bolton quickly indicates he offered first.\n\nI offered to resign last night and President Trump said, \"Let's talk about it tomorrow.\" \u2014 John Bolton (@AmbJohnBolton) September 10, 2019\n\nSept. 11. The Trump administration releases the Ukraine aid it had been withholding.\n\nSept. 13. Schiff subpoenas Maguire to compel him to disclose the whistleblower complaint.\n\nAccording to Schiff, the DNI\u2019s office, in a letter from counsel, indicates the whistleblower complaint is being withheld because of confidentially and potentially privileged communications by people outside the intelligence community. It is assumed that this refers to Trump.\n\nSept. 17. Maguire says he will not testify or hand over the whistleblower complaint. Schiff says Maguire told him he couldn\u2019t \u201cbecause he is being instructed not to, that this involved a higher authority, someone above.\u201d\n\nSept. 18. The Post reports that the complaint involves Trump\u2019s communications with a foreign leader and some kind of \u201cpromise\u201d that was made.\n\nSept. 19. Atkinson briefs Congress in a closed-door session, telling them the complaint involved multiple events and not a single communication. The Post reports the complaint involves Ukraine.\n\nThat evening, Giuliani appears on CNN and denies any wrongdoing by Trump, but also suggests it would be okay if Trump withheld aid in exchange for Ukraine investigating the Bidens.\n\n\u201cThe reality is the president of the United States has every right to say to another leader of a foreign country, \u2018You got to straighten up before we give you a lot of money,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIt is perfectly appropriate for [Trump] to ask a foreign government to investigate this massive crime that was made by a former vice president.\u201d\n\nSept. 23. Trump suggests aid to Ukraine may have been withheld over \u201ccorruption\u201d issues \u2014 without citing the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very important that, on occasion, you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nSept. 24. Trump confirms he withheld the funding but suggests it was because other European countries should pay for Ukraine\u2019s military aid.\n\nSept. 25. Trump is scheduled to meet with Zelensky at the United Nations.\n\nSept. 26. Maguire is slated to testify to the House Intelligence Committee.
