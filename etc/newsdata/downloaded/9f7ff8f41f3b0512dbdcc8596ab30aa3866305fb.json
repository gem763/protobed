Part of a road was swept away in flooding.\n\nAuthorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years.\n\nSome 100 injuries have been reported so far, while more than 270,000 households lost power, NHK said.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours.\n\nHagibis, which means \"speed\" in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan's main island of Honshu on Saturday evening.\n\nA magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after.\n\n(Image: JIJI PRESS/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMajor shinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo would begin on schedule Sunday, NHK said, while the Tokyo subway system was also operating.\n\nOne expert, Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, had earlier told Reuters that further flooding could occur as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream.\n\nAbout 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level.\n\n(Image: JIJI PRESS/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of potential for once in decades rain totals. It lifted the alerts early Sunday.\n\nJust last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages.\n\nThe capital's main airports, Haneda and Narita, stopped flights from landing and connecting trains were suspended, forcing the cancellation of more than a thousand flights.\n\nMany people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities early, before the worst of the storm arrived.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nYuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community centre in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit.\n\nShe said she decided to move before it was too late.\n\n\"I've got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\" Ikemura told Reuters.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"We brought with us the bare necessities. I'm scared to think about when we will have run out diapers and milk.\"\n\nThe Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada on Sunday in Kamaishi was cancelled. Two matches were cancelled on Saturday.\n\nFormula One Grand Prix organisers had cancelled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday.", "description": "Typhoon is most powerful to hit since 1958, leaving rivers flooded and almost 500,000 homes without power", "authors": ["Andrew Gilpin", "Image", "Jiji Press Afp Via Getty Images", "Aled Evans", "Yeime", "Xinhua Rex", "Reuters", "Jiji Press Epa-Efe Rex", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569018.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TOPSHOT-JAPAN-WEATHER-TYPHOON.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
