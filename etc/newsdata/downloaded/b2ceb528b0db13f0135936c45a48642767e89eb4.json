Unfortunately, the event was plagued with logistical problems from the get-go. The promoters were forced to change locations more than once, and, as a result, the stage wasn\u2019t built by the time concert-goers started showing up. There wasn\u2019t enough food for the festival attendees, nor were there enough sanitary facilities. High-profile acts pulled out at the last minute. The weather refused to cooperate.\n\nThis may sound like the story of Fyre Festival, the disastrous 2017 festival-that-wasn\u2019t that became the subject of two documentaries and a criminal trial. But in actuality, it\u2019s a description of Woodstock, the legendary music festival that took place 50 years ago this summer, just outside of the town of Bethel, N.Y.\n\nDespite having similar issues, there were a couple of key differences between Woodstock and Fyre Fest. For one, Woodstock\u2019s organizers seemed to have genuinely good intentions, even if their planning skills were suboptimal. Fyre Festival\u2019s organizers? Not so much. For another, Woodstock actually worked. In spite of almost everything that went wrong, it was still an event that defined a generation. It\u2019s not remembered as a money-losing disaster that needed crucial aid from neighbouring farms, a commune and the U.S. Army; it\u2019s remembered as the greatest festival of all time.\n\nIn Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation, a documentary from The Passionate Eye, the people who were there \u2014 including those who helped put on the festival \u2014 remember what went wrong and how it all turned out right anyway.\n\nHere are a few of Woodstock\u2019s lowlights.\n\nThey couldn\u2019t find a venue\n\nAs its name suggests, the festival was originally supposed to take place in Woodstock, N.Y. That is until the festival promoters \u2014 Artie Kornfeld, Joel Rosenman, Michael Lang and the late John P. Roberts \u2014 figured out that the 10-acre property they\u2019d optioned near Woodstock wasn\u2019t going to be big enough for what they had planned. They then lost out on a property in the nearby town of Saugerties.\n\nEventually, the promoters settled on a property in the town of Wallkill, roughly an hour south of Woodstock, and started building a stage. Unfortunately, Wallkill didn\u2019t want them. The town passed an ordinance banning gatherings of more than 5,000 people about five weeks before the festival was supposed to happen \u2014 after thousands of tickets had already been sold.\n\nA new site was ultimately found in the town of Bethel, on the 600-acre dairy farm belonging to Max Yasgur. But the late venue change meant that \u2026\n\nThe stage still wasn\u2019t built when concert-goers started arriving\n\n\u201cWe had to start all over again to construct what we had built in several months in Wallkill in less than four weeks,\u201d promoter Joel Rosenman says in the documentary. That meant building stages, fences, portable toilets, concession stands \u2026 everything.\n\nRoughly one week before the festival was due to start, concert-goers began turning up and pitching tents in the field. Nobody had checked their tickets because the fences weren\u2019t up yet, and no one was putting up fences because the festival still didn\u2019t have a stage.\n\n\u201cThe construction foreman told us, \u2018We just don\u2019t have enough time to finish everything. So, which would you like to have us finish, the gates and the fences or the stage? We don\u2019t have enough men and material to do both,\u2019\u201d says Rosenman.\n\n\u201cI remember thinking, \u2018If we don\u2019t have gates and fences then we\u2019re not gonna collect tickets. We\u2019ll be bankrupt. And if we don\u2019t have a stage, we\u2019ll be in jail because there will be 100,000 kids running around with nothing to do \u2014 for three days.\u2019 So that was the answer; the answer was [to] build the stage.\u201d\n\nMany high-profile acts declined to play, while others dropped out at the last minute\n\nThe list of bands that were offered the chance to play Woodstock and turned it down is even more impressive than the list of bands who played the festival. Led Zeppelin, who were in the middle of a U.S. tour, declined because their manager thought they would be \u201cjust another band on the bill.\u201d Joni Mitchell was scheduled to perform but ended up backing out because it could have resulted in her missing a spot on The Dick Cavett Show.\n\nIn order to entice some of the biggest acts to perform at the festival, the organizers had agreed to pay some artists more than double their usual rate. Many asked to be paid in cash before stepping on stage. Promoter John P. Roberts used his trust fund as collateral to secure an emergency loan, and the promoters got a local bank open around midnight on Saturday so they could withdraw the money.\n\nThey had to bring in the army\n\nWoodstock\u2019s organizers had planned to sell about 100,000 tickets to the festival. Instead, more than 400,000 attendees showed up, which meant there wasn\u2019t enough of anything, including doctors. And with that many people in one place, there were going to be medical emergencies; people got hurt, people got sick, people got too high.\n\nMembers of a commune called the Hog Farm managed to talk most of the folks in the latter category through their bad trips in \u201cfreakout tents.\u201d The commune, founded by Wavy Gravy (n\u00e9e Hugh Romney) and known for its brightly painted school buses, had been brought in from New Mexico to act as security for the festival. (Gravy said they would act as a \u201cPlease Force,\u201d asking people to do things by saying \u201cplease,\u201d rather than making them do anything.)\n\nBut for people who were injured, the Hog Farm wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 they were in deep trouble. The festival had quickly run out of supplies, and the promoters were overwhelmed. They got in touch with the New York State Governor\u2019s office, and initially, Governor Nelson Rockafeller wanted to send in the National Guard to shut things down.\n\n\u201cI kept saying, \u2018There\u2019s only one way to do this, and that\u2019s [to] play it through,\u2019\u201d says John Morris, who worked as a production coordinator at Woodstock. \u201cIn the end, there was an assistant to the governor who got it, and he said, \u2018What can we do?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe festival organizers managed to get 45 army doctors flown in via helicopter. The army also brought food, medical supplies and blankets. But at a time when many of the men in the crowd were terrified of being sent to Vietnam, the sight of helicopters wasn\u2019t necessarily a relief.\n\n\u201cWhy are there army helicopters flying overhead?\u201d attendee Susie Kaufman recalls thinking. \u201cYou know, it looked like what I saw on the news every night [and] in the pictures from Vietnam.\u201d\n\nThey ran out of food\n\nIt was clear that food was going to be a challenge before the festival even started. \u201cWe had spoken to a lot of different food concession people, and all of them, the legitimate guys, went by the wayside when we lost Wallkill,\u201d Roberts says in the documentary.\n\n\u201cWhat was left was an outfit called Food For Love. There were three of them \u2014 three guys. I think one of them had some kind of food catering experience. I don\u2019t think the other two did. But we didn\u2019t have any alternative.\u201d\n\nWhen Food for Love wasn\u2019t able to serve 400,000-plus people, once again, the Hog Farm stepped into the fray. \u201c[They] had set up this huge kitchen, and they were boiling brown rice and frying up vegetables,\u201d concert-goer Katherine Daye remembers. \u201cIt was fabulous.\u201d\n\nLocal farmers also helped out, donating hundreds of thousands of hard-boiled eggs to feed the starving hippie masses.\n\n\u201cThe festival became a symbol of intelligence and humanity and cooperation and love and affection. It was the start of a phenomenal change in a lot of people\u2019s lives,\u201d says Hog Farm member Tom Law.\n\nWatch Woodstock: Three Days that Defined a Generation on The Passionate Eye.", "description": "Plagued with logistical problems from the start, Woodstock could have been a disaster but ended up defining a generation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbc.ca/passionateeye/content/images/episodes/woodstockstory_1920.jpg"}
