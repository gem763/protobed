The explanation: Colts defensive end Justin Houston was draped around Watson\u2019s lower legs and was pulling him to the ground so the officials ruled Watson it a sack.\n\n\u201cI went back and forth with the ref,\u201d Watson said following the Texans\u2019 30-23 loss at Indianapolis. \u201cHe said I was down. He said he was trying to protect my health so it goes back and forth, but that\u2019s the call he made.\u201d\n\nIt cost Houston 9 yards, forced it to trade a touchdown for a short field goal instead of taking the lead and there was nothing the Texans (4-3) could do but accept it.\n\nAfterward, Watson acknowledged the rare in the grasp call made a \u201cbig difference\u201d as the Texans spent most of the day trying to rally for their fourth win in Indianapolis in five tries.\n\nBut the one call certainly wasn\u2019t the only obstacle Houston (4-3) had to deal with Sunday.\n\nThe Texans settled for field goals on each of their first three red-zone trips, including the touchdown that was called back. Watson threw away two more scoring chances with fourth-quarter interceptions. The second, off the hands of receiver Keke Coutee, was snared by All-Pro linebacker Darius Leonard with 26 seconds left to seal the outcome.\n\nHouston also turned the ball over on downs near midfield early in the fourth quarter and the Colts accepted 10 penalties, three of which extended the Colts final scoring drive. Indy (4-2) burned nearly 7 \u00bd minutes on that 12-play possession that made it a 28-16.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough to stomach, the Colts even won a challenge after replays showed Eric Ebron got both feet down in front of the end line on a remarkable one-handed catch for a 4-yard scoring pass. That gave Indy a 21-9 lead early in the third quarter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer any officiating questions,\u201d Houston coach Bill O\u2019Brien said twice.\n\nWhile nobody voiced any criticism of the calls publicly, the Texans seemed nearly as frustrated with what happened Sunday as many other teams, coaches and fans around the league have been with the officiating over the first seven weeks this season.\n\nBut O\u2019Brien and his players understand that talking about it won\u2019t help. The only real solution is fixing the mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely going to work to correct them,\u201d three-time defensive player of the year J.J. Watt said when asked about the penalties. \u201cI haven\u2019t watched the film yet so I can\u2019t say what - we will have to watch the film and see what we can correct.\u201d\n\nHeading into Sunday, it appeared the Texans had found some solutions for their early season flaws.\n\nThey allowed no sacks in the previous two games. Carlos Hyde posted his first 100-yard game in more than two years during a victory at Kansas City, and Watson threw six TD passes in the previous two games while completing nearly 80 percent of his throws and had six TD passes in the previous two games.\n\nOn Sunday, things went awry.\n\nWatson endured six hits and was sacked three times, going 23 of 34 with 308 yards and only one touchdown. Hyde was the top runner with 12 carries for 35 yards, and the Texans now find themselves sitting in second place in the AFC South with three straight losses to the Colts.\n\nAnd it won\u2019t be easy to accept this one.\n\n\u201cYou have to give the Colts credit, they handled what they needed to handle,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t execute enough to be able to capitalize. We have to take our game to another level and go back to the drawing board and get ready for the Raiders.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson couldn't believe what he was being told Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/20/texans_colts_football_67955_c0-877-1910-1991_s1200x700.jpg?f9c58cb7afaa57837063dd61ecf0a6d9fa6715c3", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
