The manor is the domain of Theresa Sackler, widow of one of Purdue Pharma\u2019s founders and, until 2018, a member of the company\u2019s board of directors. A complex web of companies and trusts are controlled by the family, and an examination reveals links between far-flung holdings, far removed from the opioid manufacturer\u2019s headquarters in Stamford, Conn. (AP Photo/Frank Augstein)\n\nIn a story Sept. 5 about the family that owns Purdue Pharma, The Associated Press, relying on information from a financial data website, erroneously reported the value of a single holding. That portfolio is valued at $169 million, not $1.7 billion, and was misstated by an order of 10 because of a technological error by the site.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nWhere did the Sacklers move cash from their opioid maker?\n\nA settlement of claims that Purdue Pharma helped fuel the opioid epidemic may be at hand, but the question remains: Where are the billions Purdue's owners, the Sackler family, took from the company?\n\nBy ADAM GELLER\n\nAP National Writer\n\nNinety minutes outside London, a turn down a narrow lane leads past fields of grazing cattle to a sign warning \"Private Keep Off.\" Around an elbow bend, a great stone manor, its formal gardens and tennis court hidden behind thick hedges, commands a 5,000-acre estate.\n\nThe estate is a pastoral prize \u2014 proof of the great wealth belonging to the family accused of playing a key role in triggering the U.S. opioid epidemic. But there's little evidence of that connection. On paper, the land is owned by seven companies, most based in distant Bermuda, all controlled by an offshore trust.\n\nThe haziness surrounding the estate hints at one of the challenges for government lawyers as they eye a potential settlement with Purdue Pharma L.P. and its owners, the Sackler family, for their alleged role in flooding communities with prescription painkillers.\n\nAll but two U.S. states and 2,000 local governments have taken legal action against Purdue, other drugmakers and distributors. Sixteen states have sued family members by name, alleging they steered Purdue while draining more than $4 billion from the company since 2007. That's when the Oxycontin maker pleaded guilty to misleading doctors, patients and regulators about the drug's risks.\n\nPurdue's CEO has said the company could file for bankruptcy. And news organizations have reported that Purdue, the family and government lawyers are negotiating a possible settlement, valued at $10 billion to $12 billion, that would see the Sacklers give up company ownership and contribute $3 billion of their own money.\n\nBut where, exactly, did the money withdrawn from Purdue over the years end up? And how much might the family be holding that state and local governments should consider fair game?\n\nAnswers are complicated by the way the Sacklers have shielded their wealth in an intricate web of companies and trusts, a review by The Associated Press has found. Some are registered in offshore tax havens far from Purdue's Connecticut headquarters.\n\nThe web's complexity and offshore reach could affect the calculus for government lawyers as they weigh how to go after Purdue, including how to calibrate demands in settlement talks.\n\n\"The Sacklers allegedly moved significant money offshore, which potentially would make it harder for any judgment creditor to reach,\" said Mark Chalos, a lawyer representing counties and cities including Nashville, Tennessee, in suits against opioids makers.\n\n\"This is the real question and you're seeing it playing out in a lot of different states in different ways,\" said Elizabeth Chamblee Burch, a professor of law at the University of Georgia. \"How do you make sure that they (the Sacklers) are not siphoning off those assets and hiding them away?\"\n\nA representative for the family of Purdue co-founder Mortimer Sackler declined to comment for this story, as did a company spokeswoman. A representative for the relatives of Raymond Sackler, Purdue's other scion, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPurdue and the Sacklers have long relied on a coterie of attorneys and accountants, as well as the family's closely held ownership of the company, to keep their business and personal dealings private.\n\nBut AP's review of court papers, securities filings by companies that have had dealings with Purdue, and documents leaked from an exclusive Bermuda law firm, show how family members have tried to protect their wealth.\n\nPurdue \u2014 controlled through layers of limited partnerships, holding companies and trusts \u2014 is at the center of the family's web. But it hardly ends there.\n\nIn Purdue's 2007 plea agreement with federal prosecutors, it listed 215 companies under its corporate umbrella. But that list did not include a number of companies used to manage property and investments for family members or the trusts, some offshore, set up to administer their fortunes.\n\nStory continues", "description": "In a story Sept. 5 about the family that owns Purdue Pharma, The Associated Press, relying on information from a financial data website, erroneously reported the value of a single holding.
