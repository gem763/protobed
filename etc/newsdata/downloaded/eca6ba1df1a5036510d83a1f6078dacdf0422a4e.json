Rejoice!\n\nI never got to play Tokyo Mirage Session, despite it being one hundred per cent my thing. You\u2019re a high schooler that\u2019s also a pop star, that also has a kinda sorta persona, like in the series Persona, and also your persona is a Fire Emblem character?\n\nIt is like Atlus reached into my dreams to make this. Unfortunately, it was only available on Wii U when it came out. Now it\u2019s coming to Switch, finally.\n\nThe Switch port of Tokyo Mirage Sessions, subtitled #FE Encore, will be out on January 17, 2020. I\u2019ll be practicing my routine in the mirror until then.", "description": "Tokyo Mirage Sessions\u00a0#FE, the crossover between Shin Megami Tensei and Fire Emblem, is coming to Switch.
