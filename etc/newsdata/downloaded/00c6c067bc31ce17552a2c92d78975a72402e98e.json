He said he hoped the recommendations would be made in the coming 12 months.\n\nThe five countries named in the complaint are among the 44 that ratified the protocol and are also among the top global polluters, as well as being members of the G20 group of leading global economies.\n\nThe largest polluters in the world -- the United States, China and India -- did not ratify the protocol.\n\nCountries like France and Germany may have recently begun working to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, but have also played a large role historically in polluting the atmosphere, the law firm argued.", "description": "After global street protests demanding action on climate change, Greta Thunberg and 15 other young activists on Monday filed a complaint at the UN against five countries for not doing enough to ward off global warming.
