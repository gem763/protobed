The men were in an area that is off-limits to hunters.\n\nA local police officer said that shortly after they set off on the hunt the men\u2019s two dogs started barking, signalling the presence of boar. The father is said to have mistakenly positioned himself in his son\u2019s path of fire. Amid the sound of barking and wild boar fleeing in the woods, the son saw a silhouette and started shooting.\n\n\u201cHe thought he had hit a boar but instead it was his father,\u201d the police officer said. \u201cHe immediately started to look for help \u2026 he was absolutely destroyed.\u201d\n\nPolice charged the son with manslaughter and seized his guns.\n\nThe pair, from Postiglione, a small town near the Alburni range, were also hunting before the official start of the hunting season on 2 October.\n\nThe killing, which comes two months after the death of another hunter, who accidentally shot himself in the head, prompted animal rights groups to renew their calls for a ban on hunting. The same calls were made in October last year after 20-year-old Marco Tosti was killed after being mistaken for a wild boar by his hunting companion.\n\nMichela Vittoria Brambilla, a former government minister and president of the Italian League for the Defence of Animals and the Environment, said on Sunday: \u201cEnough with this wild west behaviour in the countryside and the forests. The authorities cannot continue to portray the high number of deaths and injuries as something natural and inevitable.\u201d", "description": "Son, aged 34, charged with manslaughter after Martino Gaudioso shot dead", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db68c34d0d936f3608bfd835927f611ff911a31/0_202_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79f778e09e989a38cff0159a49e0bf8b", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
