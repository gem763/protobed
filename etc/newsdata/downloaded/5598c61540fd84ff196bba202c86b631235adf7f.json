This includes Dutch capital Amsterdam and Rotterdam. From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland was a unified political region within the Holy Roman Empire, ruled by the Counts of Holland. But between 1588 and 1795, the maritime and economic power was absorbed into what was then known as the Republic of Seven United Netherlands. It has since remained part of the nation, which became the Kingdom of the Netherlands under Napoleon.
