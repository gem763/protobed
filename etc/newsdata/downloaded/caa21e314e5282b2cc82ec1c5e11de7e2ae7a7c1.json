She'll join American Express next month as chief corporate affairs officer.\n\nSkyler ran WeWork's communications until April, when Jimmy Asci took over. Asci came from advisory firm Teneo, where he was part of a team that worked with Uber's former chief executive, Travis Kalanick. After Asci joined WeWork, Skyler transitioned to running CEO Adam Neumann's office, including his public relations efforts. Skyler declined to comment on her departure from WeWork.\n\nIn late July, Dom McMullan, the firm's head of corporate communications who reported to Asci, said he was leaving after three and a half years with the company. McMullan declined to comment and has not announced his next move.\n\n\"He decided that it was time to go. He had been here for a long time,\" said a source with knowledge of McMullan's departure.\n\nSkyler and McMullan both left as WeWork was gearing up for an IPO that's seen a number of public missteps, including governance issues that the company worked to correct through a new filing last week and revised valuations.
