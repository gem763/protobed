In what capacity I\u2019m not sure but I want to make sure that the influence I have in the country has a positive contribution,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter two days of violent protests, tensions had cooled on Friday in Addis Ababa, although the total damage inflicted by the unrest was still being tallied.\n\nFisseha said the violence had included instances of security forces opening fire on protesters, but that it was increasingly taking the form of ethnic and religious clashes.\n\n\u201cSome people have lost their lives with sticks, with machetes, some houses have been burned. People have been using even bullets and light arms to kill each other, to fight each other,\u201d he said.\n\nAt least six people were killed in the town of Ambo, west of Addis, after security forces opened fire on protesters, Fisseha said. Ethnic and religious violence has been reported in the towns and cities of Dodola, Harar, Bale Robe and Adama.", "description": "Violent clashes leave at least 67 dead as activist compares Abiy Ahmed to a dictator", "authors": ["Afp In Addis Ababa"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e52a1887a499ffd98ab5867125dcd263ac88db1/0_0_2644_1587/master/2644.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a975251a2cbdfe61ea3de6281676771d", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
