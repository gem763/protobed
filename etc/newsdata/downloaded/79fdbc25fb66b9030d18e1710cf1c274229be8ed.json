It\u2019s totally normal, she says. In fact, research has shown that more than a quarter of premenopausal women have a low sex drive.\n\nHowever, if your lack of interest in doing the deed is distressing and feels persistent, you may have a condition called hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), says Dr Sheryl A. Kingsberg, chief of the division of behavioural medicine in the ob-gyn department at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center\u2019s MacDonald Women\u2019s Hospital.\n\nThe good news is, \u201cit\u2019s possible to restore sexual desire if a woman experiences a significant decrease,\u201d Kingsberg says. There are options, including counseling and medical treatment, to deal with the underlying causes.\n\nSo when is your low sex drive \u201clow enough\u201d to have a conversation with your doctor? Here\u2019s how to tell if you should make an appointment.\n\nSign 1: The shift comes on suddenly, and stays.\n\nHave you recently started taking birth control pills or antidepressants? Meds can be one reason for a change in libido, according to Kingsberg and Stewart. So can major or stressful life events, like a change in your health or relationship status, or starting a new job.\n\nHowever, if your low sex drive sticks around even after you get used to your new prescription or lifestyle, you may want to check in with your doc. She may be able to recommend an alternative medication with fewer side effects or discuss treatments if she thinks something else, like HSDD, could be to blame.\n\nREAD MORE: 8 Reasons Why You Never Want To Have Sex Anymore\n\nSign 2: It\u2019s causing stress in your relationship.\n\nThere\u2019s a caveat here: \u201cFirst, consider whether your low sex drive is causing stress in the relationship, or stress in the relationship is causing low sex drive,\u201d Kingsberg says.\n\nIf things have been smooth sailing and you have no doubts about your attraction to your partner, it\u2019s possible HSDD could be to blame. If it\u2019s the latter, you two need to work on whatever is behind that stress. Either way, the first step is communication.\n\nMaybe the two of you seek out the assistance of a sex therapist together, or perhaps this is something you\u2019d feel more comfortable talking about with an expert on your own. Whatever you decide, go into the session with an open mind.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Low Libido Causes That Have Nothing To Do With Hormones\n\nSign 3: It\u2019s negatively affecting your quality of life.\n\nSome women want a six-times-a-week romp situation. Others? Not so much. Both types of women are normal, says Pam Costa, a sex and relationship therapist in Cupertino, California, who adds that \u201ceveryone\u2019s sex drive is different, but what matters is if you\u2019re content with where your levels are.\u201d\n\nNot feeling great about your sex life can impact your life way beyond the bedroom. \u201cSexual health is important to overall health, and every woman has a right to a healthy sexual life,\u201d Kingsberg says.\n\nIn other words: If your lack of desire is messing with your happiness, you owe it to yourself to do something about it. After all, sex is supposed to be pleasurable!\n\nThis article was originally published on www.womenshealthsa.co.za\n\nImage credit: iStock", "description": "Because you deserve pleasure", "authors": ["Emily Abbate"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9446/af3dca02ea9e408cb064429d9590ce59.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
