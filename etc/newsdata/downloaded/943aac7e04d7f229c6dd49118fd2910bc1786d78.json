He came in third, giving him the overall silver medal.\n\nUibo said his race preparations had prevented him from watching his wife\u2019s race, but he was still keeping a close eye on the results.\n\n\u201cI was only able to refresh the results page as I was getting ready for my 1,500 metres,\u201d the 26-year-old said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to watch the real race in the replay later on.\u201d\n\nMiller-Uibo then hung around the track by the finish line to watch her husband race.\n\n\u201cHe was hoping for the gold,\u201d the 25-year-old told reporters separately after her event. \u201cI knew he wasn\u2019t quite that well in shape for his 1,500 metres, but he gave it his all. I\u2019m so proud of him.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who had dominated their disciplines in the lead up to the Doha championships, took a joint walk along the track in the Khalifa International Stadium with their respective flags draped around their shoulders.\n\n\u201cAs athletes we\u2019re very competitive,\u201d Uibo said. \u201cWe train together, we practice at the same time sometimes. It\u2019s always a little bit competitive on the track and off the track.\u201d", "description": "Estonian decathlete Maicel Uibo and his wife, Bahamian runner Shaunae Miller-Uibo, had two reasons to celebrate after they each won a silver medal at the world athletics championships on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436838824&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9300Q"}
