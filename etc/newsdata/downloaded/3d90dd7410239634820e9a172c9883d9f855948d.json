For those of us in the corporate slog, our constant connectivity to the cloud has made it easier to earn those sweet overtime rates, but at what cost?\n\nWouldn't you prefer to earn money by doing absolutely nothing at all? If you're human, the answer is probably yes. Here are four ways you can do just that.\n\n#1 Open a Term Deposit account\n\nA term deposit account is literally the definition of earning money for doing nothing.\n\nAs a fixed term investment, term deposits lock away your money until the end of an agreed loan term when the account reaches maturity.\n\nHere's how term deposits work:\n\nDeposit your money Wait until the deposit term ends Voila, free money!\n\nWith term deposit rates currently sitting around 2%, a $5,000 deposit now could earn you $100 in just 1 year. (Click here to learn more!)\n\nOr, if you have a little more stashed away, a $250,000 deposit into a BCU Term Deposit account could earn you 2.15% over 3 years. That amounts to a whopping $16,125 for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nClick on the deals above to learn more.\n\n#2 Invest in the stock market\n\nInvesting in the stock market used to be reserved for mathematical and statistical geniuses. Luckily - like most difficult tasks these days - this can now be outsourced to an app.\n\nIntroducing the money-making app that automatically saves smalls sums of money for you to earn small returns: Raiz.\n\nThis micro-investing app is perfect for the laidback Aussie, working like this:\n\nLink your everyday bank account or transaction account to the app Put your investment strategy on autopilot Voila, free money!\n\nSimilar to how your super fund invests your money, Raiz manages fund portfolios which invest in a variety of investments via Exchange traded funds (EFTs). These investments, plus the roundups from your everyday spending into your Raiz account which trick you into saving, all add up.\n\nWhilst you might not see the same returns with Raiz as that $250K term deposit account, free money is free money.\n\nClick on the deals above to learn more.\n\n#3 Open a transaction account\n\nAt the moment, there are a few banks offering tasty sign up cashback bonuses to attract new business.\n\nThis is great news if you're looking at switching banks, as technically you'll earn money for doing nothing more than what you were already planning to do!\n\nHere's what you need to do:\n\nOpen a bank account with a lender offering a cashback sign up bonus Meet the terms and conditions of said bank account Voila, free money!\n\nTo make it even easier for you, we've found three banks offering free cash for switching.\n\nBank Account Cashback Offer Expiry Date St George Complete Freedom Account $40 3rd October 2019 Westpac Choice Account $50 9th October 2019 HSBC Everyday Global Account $100 31st March 2020\n\nData accurate as at 23rd September 2019. Terms, conditions, fees and charges apply.\n\n#4 Top up your super fund\n\nNow, if you're in your thirties or your forties, a simple way to make money by doing pretty much nothing is by whipping your super into shape.\n\nIf you've always left it 'for later', not really thinking about how it can work for you \u2013 it might be time to consolidate your super and find some missing money.\n\nBillions of dollars in unclaimed and lost super are currently being held by super funds and the Australian Tax Office (ATO), so it's worth checking if you have some in there!\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to do:\n\nContact your super fund online or via phone Give permission for them to find and consolidate your super Voila, free money!\n\nThe process is super simple, and your current fund will obviously want to help you find and retrieve the money so that it's in their accounts.\n\nAnother thing you may want to look at with your super is how it's invested. Sounds boring, but if you're 25-35 years off retirement, moving from a conservative, balanced option to a more aggressive, higher-risk, higher-growth investment option could pay off.\n\nWho knew making money could be so simple?\n\nFind more great bargains at Lifehacker Coupons.\n\nAs Lifehacker editors we write about stuff we like and think you'll like too.
