Faced with parliamentary resistance to his blatant attempt to bounce MPs into approving his Brexit deal, virtually sight unseen, the prime minister threatens to speak to 27 heads of government in the EU, in an open attempt to subvert the law that required him to seek an Article 50 extension.\n\nPerhaps, as has been hinted before, he may in due course threaten a general election. In the past he has threatened a no-deal Brexit if he does not get his way, and he has hinted at that again. He has \u201cpaused\u201d his bill \u2013 so he is now taking his ball home if he\u2019s not allowed to win the game. These are the standard tactics of the bully, and unworthy of the office he holds. Nor will the ploy work.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nNo-deal Brexit has been outlawed, a formal application to extend Article 50 has been made, the EU negotiates via Michel Barnier, not individual member states, the opposition will not give him an early election. These are the facts.\n\nBoris Johnson seems to want to inhabit a fantasy world where he is king, where he has already won the landslide majority he dreams of, and where the House of Commons is reduced to a talking shop.\n\nThat would certainly be a more amenable spot than the muddy ditch in which he now finds himself stuck, if not politically dead. But he is where he is, and it is his own fault. It was simple impetuousness that drove his demand to have the Commons examine such major complex legislation in three days flat \u2013 far too little time.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Johnson\u2019s bill might have much in common with Theresa May\u2019s, but the crucial Northern Ireland protocol is all-new, as are (weak) clauses relating to protecting employment rights.\n\nMoreover, likely amendments would change its nature still more radically. They may or may not \u201cwreck\u201d the bill, but MPs and the speaker are entitled to the time needed to determine that and to discuss and vote on them.\n\nA customs union and a second referendum are both changes that would command cross-party support, and would be manifestly acceptable to Brussels \u2013 not wrecking moves at all, but actually ways to settle Brexit consensually. It is what a 48-52 per cent split in public opinion has always pointed towards. They need time to consider and implement.\n\nIt is only unacceptable to Mr Johnson because of his own foolish and unrealistic pledges during his Tory leadership campaign. They are entirely self-ordained and self inflicted, in fact, in a world where the EU is minded to grant an extension. It puts unnecessary pressure on parliament. A rushed timetable would mean poor oversight and bad law, and this act matters more than most.\n\nPrevious EU treaties, such as Nice, Rome and Maastricht took many weeks. This one has its own complications and sensitivities, even if it is shorter and parts have been published before. It will lack legitimacy if it is railroaded through. That too is a manifest fact.\n\nLike dealing with a toddler in a tantrum, EU leaders and MPs should let Mr Johnson bawl as much as he likes, and insist on MPs getting on with their job. The Commons will scrutinise the bill and expose its shortcomings. They will show parts of it are unworkable, or unacceptable, such as the Northern Ireland plan. They will expose dangers, such as the trap door to a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition in 2020 or 2021.\n\n\u201cLexiteer\u201d Labour rebels such as Caroline Flint and Lisa Nandy may realise how feeble the worker protections promised by Mr Johnson really are \u2013 and how little they can trust him. They will also suggest ways to make the bill actually pass and become law, such as making it contingent on a Final Say referendum.\n\nParliament represents the views of the whole nation, not just Leavers. It should not be impeded from doing its job. It has taken back control, whether ministers like it or not. We are not leaving on 31 October \u2013 unless Mr Johnson agrees to a second referendum. There is the one public vote he can have immediately, and the only way to make his deal law.", "description": "There he goes again.
