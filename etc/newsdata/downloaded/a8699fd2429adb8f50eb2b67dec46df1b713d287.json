That is the most by any player through the first five games since Hall of Famer Jim Brown had 988 in 1963.\n\nA shock? Not to his coach.\n\n\"If I'm being totally honest, we're seeing exactly what we thought we would see,\" Kula admitted.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcCaffrey has combined speed, elusiveness and power to devastating effect; he showcased his athleticism last weekend by going in for a touchdown despite being flipped as he hurdled Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Tre Herndon.\n\nYet perhaps surprisingly given his incredible physique, McCaffrey's training regime does not feature hours upon hours in the gym.\n\n\"He really only trains about five or six hours a week,\" Kula explained.\n\n\"We feel like less is more, we definitely want him 100 per cent healthy and the way that we train, we're targeting the fast-twitch muscles. We incorporate a lot of recovery and rest with the training and what we do is very high output.\n\n\"We concentrate a lot on speed mechanics, speed loading, acceleration principles, which also translates to his lateral change of direction as well.\n\n\"In the weight room we're very unconventional with the type of lifting. We're pretty much after a concept called 'mass specific force', where we want him to be as strong and powerful as possible, without putting on any additional weight so we can keep his top-end speed up.\n\n\"His body-fat percentage came down [this year] and where we were concentrating on his strength was in his hips and in his legs. What you've seen is a reconfigured body, not necessarily a bigger body - certainly more powerful. We concentrated in the weight room on the deadlift and the development of his posterior chain.\"\n\nKula has continued to speak with McCaffrey during the early stages of the regular season. The running back called his coach prior to boarding the flight to London earlier this week to get a daily fitness routine, as well as tips on hydration and travel.\n\n\"He would do as much as I asked him to do but has finally wrapped his head around recovery and rest being more important,\" Kula noted.\n\nThere are other key members of McCaffrey's inner circle too - including nutritionists and a chef who sends meals from Colorado twice a week.\n\n\"He is absolutely meticulous about everything that he does,\" Kula explained. \"Where Christian separates himself is his attention to detail and absolute focus when it comes to his goals.\"\n\nHe might not be bigger, but so far McCaffrey has undoubtedly been better. Perhaps better than everyone else in the NFL too.", "description": "Omnisport spoke to Christian McCaffrey's trainer to find out how the Panthers running back prepared for his fine start to the season.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/atA9uiwKOIW8H94IKSYD8g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VCZrQ0FKib5HnlFyYRa3.A--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/omnisport.uk/ca56a6a1d1560b7c64ae6efb542b0afa", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
