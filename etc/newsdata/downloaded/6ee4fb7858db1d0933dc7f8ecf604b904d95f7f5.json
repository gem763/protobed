Although he was known as a musician and actor as well as a prolific street art-inspired painter, a newly reissued film might give more insight into just how much acting and music affected his early career. At a premiere screening for Metrograph Pictures\u2019 reissue of Downtown 81 (co-sponsored by Vulture) in New York on October 25, a panel of people close to the film note that they played a significant part in the beginning of Basquiat\u2019s work. \u201cThe production bought Jean his first real art supplies and gave him his first real studio, which he lived in,\u201d said Gina Nanni, widow of writer and Warhol associate Glenn O\u2019Brien. \u201cAll of the books that talk about [art dealer] Annina Nosei giving Jean-Michel his first studio, that wasn\u2019t actually true. The film production gave him his first studio, and the first paintings that he made were the paintings that you saw him carrying around in the film.\u201d O\u2019Brien took pride in that, Nanni added \u2014 and it was especially fitting that, in the film, Basquiat played a painter and musician trying to start his career.\n\nMaripol, the designer for Madonna and other pop stars, was a producer on the film, along with Basquiat\u2019s former neighbor. As he struggled for art-world recognition in the \u201980s, she remembered Basquiat pushing for the film\u2019s release, as the project stagnated because of lost reels and a studio disagreement. \u201cHe was a bit depressed, Jean, because he realized that, you know, he was not recognized as much as he should have been,\u201d Maripol said. \u201cHe was ready to give the money for it.\u201d Downtown 81 eventually premiered at Cannes in 2000 and saw a theatrical release in 2001, but the love for New York\u2019s indie scene depicted by the movie was soon overshadowed by 9/11.\n\nNow with the widening rerelease of the film in the coming weeks, Nanni hopes that it dispels another rumor about Basquiat. \u201cHe was the life of the party, he was a joy to be around,\u201d Nanni said O\u2019Brien told her of the artist, even though his downward turn is often the way in which he\u2019s discussed. She thinks Downtown 81 shows a different side of Basquiat. \u201cEven though he was acting, [O\u2019Brien] felt that it showed more of what he was really like.\u201d", "description": "Memories of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat were front and center at a panel for the rerelease of \u2018Downtown 81,\u2019 including correcting the record on his career beginnings.", "authors": ["Justin Curto"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/28/28-basquiat-downtown-81.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
