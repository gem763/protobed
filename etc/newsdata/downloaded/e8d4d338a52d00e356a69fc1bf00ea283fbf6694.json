I would go in because I liked the fabric, but I didn\u2019t like the styles. Then one day I was in the neighborhood, maybe a decade and a half later, and I walked into the store and was like, What the hell, this is not the same store. These two young women who are sisters, Bo and Kay, were like, We\u2019re the daughters of the woman who used to own the store, our mom was going to get rid of the shop, and we were like \u2018no this is a staple in the community, we\u2019ll take it over.\u2019 So the two daughters took it over and they did a lot of styling and the clothes from Black Panther. They do a lot of custom stuff, and you can go on Instagram and order from them. It\u2019s such a good vibe.
