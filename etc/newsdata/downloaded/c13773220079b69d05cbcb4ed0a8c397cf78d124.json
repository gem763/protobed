Wayne Brady? Sherri Shepherd? Our best guesses on the celebrities in disguise.", "language": "en", "text": "Here are our best guesses on the famous faces behind the Penguin, Fox and Flower masks.\n\n(Spoiler alert: We\u2019ll update this post as the other celebrities are revealed.)\n\nFlower\n\nWhat we know about them: We would consider Flower a \u201clegend\u201d even if she hadn\u2019t declared herself one because wow. Her performance of Dolly Parton\u2019s \u201c9 to 5\u201d earned a standing ovation, and Flower beamed as she took it all in. Her intro package alluded to a love of cooking and an empire (which, on this show and \u2014 ahem \u2014 network, usually means \u201cEmpire\u201d). This is a confident celebrity: When host Nick Cannon asked why she picked the Flower as her costume, she replied: \u201cBecause I\u2019m beautiful and I smell so good.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat the judges thought: Flower\u2019s references to \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It\u201d and \u201cVision of Love\u201d made the panel think of two very famous singers: Tina Turner and Mariah Carey, the latter of whom inspired some jokes at the expense of her ex-husband, Cannon. Judge Jenny McCarthy zeroed in on the \u201cEmpire\u201d reference, and guessed Taraji P. Henson.\n\nFellow judge Robin Thicke suggested a few other names: Jennifer Hudson and Jessie J, among them. Judge Ken Jeong, naturally, went with Bjork.\n\nBut that voice could only be one celebrity, and judge Nicole Scherzinger was cautious as she tossed out her name: \u201cI thought I heard Patti LaBelle\u2019s voice in there.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nPrevailing social media theories: LaBelle\n\nOur guess: This is Ms. Patti LaBelle, folks. (If that seems implausible, remember that Gladys Knight appeared on the first season.) The voice is the giveaway, but the cooking and empire (\u201cEmpire\u201d) references support our hypothesis. Also, did you catch the mock degree from \u201cTemple U\u201d? LaBelle got an honorary degree from Temple University in 2010.\n\nAD\n\nPenguin\n\nWhat we know about them: Penguin referenced her avatar\u2019s \u201cvery expressive\u201d nature in her intro package, which found her repeating a frigid critique: \u201cClearly this bird did not get the word that her career is over.\u201d Ouch. The video also included a prominent \u201cI\u2019m not your secretary\u201d sign. Penguin assured us that she was ready to \u201cbring the heat\u201d despite being \u201ccold as ice.\u201d She also reminded us that \u201ceverything is not as black and white as it seems.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAhead of her performance of \u201cThe Middle\u201d by Maren Morris and Zedd, she vowed to \u201csing for those of us who dare to be different.\u201d\n\nWhat the judges thought: This one seemed to stump the panel. \u201cThat penguin is teeny tiny teeny,\u201d volunteered McCarthy, who candidly confessed that the references to Penguin\u2019s career being \u201cover\u201d made her think of Kathy Griffin. But Penguin\u2019s voice made her think of a celebrity she suspected of being on the show in its first season: Sherri Shepherd. Thicke disagreed. He said he thought the Penguin \u201cmoved like\u201d McCarthy\u2019s Oscar-nominated cousin, Melissa.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nScherzinger, parsing the secretary reference, guessed Megan Mullally, whose \u201cWill & Grace\u201d character is technically a secretary to Debra Messing\u2019s Grace.\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Singer-songwriter (and \u201cPitch Perfect\u201d star) Ester Dean, Shepherd, Raven-Symon\u00e9 and, uh, Tonya Harding.\n\nOur guess: We\u2019re more confident about who this isn\u2019t since we declared Raven-Symon\u00e9 the Black Widow last week. And Penguin isn\u2019t as powerful a singer as Dean, which leaves us to consider Shepherd (we\u2019re disregarding the Harding suggestion because we just don\u2019t hear it). Turns out Shepherd worked for years as a legal secretary before making her foray into showbiz.\n\nAD\n\nFox\n\nWhat we know about them: Like his nocturnal avatar, Fox told us he\u2019s done his \u201cbest work at night.\u201d He mentioned having two distinct \u201cidentities\u201d \u2014 including an \u201con-air superhero.\u201d When Cannon asked what made him the Fox he noted: \u201cI\u2019m quick, I refuse to be caged in and I\u2019m crafty.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhat the judges thought: Fox performed Maroon 5\u2032s \u201cThis Love\u201d but the judges thought he moved like Jagger. Nicole noted his \u201cdancer\u2019s stance.\u201d \u201cHe moved like a professional performer,\u201d Thicke agreed.\n\nThe panel fixated on certain clues in the Fox\u2019s intro package \u2014 including his references to \u201cDoogie\u201d and \u201cDoubtfire,\u201d concluding these were probably references to Neil Patrick Harris and the late Robin Williams. McCarthy guessed the Fox had Broadway roots, and tossed out Tony Award-winning \u201cHamilton\u201d star Leslie Odom Jr.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re an accomplished actor who many people don\u2019t know sings,\u201d said Jeong, who declared the Fox was his \u201cFast and Furious\u201d co-star Tyrese Gibson. (The comedian may have missed the memo on Gibson\u2019s early career.)\n\n\u201cThat ain\u2019t Tyrese,\u201d countered Thicke. Scherzinger, meanwhile, suggested actor Anthony Mackie, whose \u201cCaptain America\u201d role fit with the Fox\u2019s superhero reference.\n\nAD\n\nPrevailing social media theories: Wayne Brady\n\nOur guess: Brady, who worked with NPH on \u201cHow I Met Your Mother,\u201d and with Williams on \u201cWhose Line Is It Anyway.\u201d He has also performed on Broadway and in Vegas. Plus, his acting career has run the gamut from soaps to sci-fi.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Is Ms. Patti LaBelle really on \"The Masked Singer\"?
