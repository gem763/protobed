Eighty-eight more made their money in the financial sector. In contrast to the 1982 Forbes list, only 14 on the 2018 list made their money in manufacturing and 24 in energy.\n\n\u201cThe 400 have trended steadily to the left,\u201d conclude Bonica and Rosenthal.\n\nThe two authors write that from 1989 to 2017, members of the Forbes 400 have fared much better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents: The 400 \u201cdid very well under the two Democrats, Clinton and Obama. They did not do well under either Bush.\u201d\n\nBonica and Rosenthal\u2019s analysis may prove troubling for those seeking to slow or reverse increasing wealth and income inequality. As the Forbes 400 moves toward the Democratic Party, they write, \u201cInequality in campaign contributions in the American plutocracy has grown hand in hand with the growth in economic inequality.\u201d\n\nThey go on to raise another basic question: Does increased support for Democrats among the affluent and the rich undermine efforts to stem the growth of inequality?\n\nThe historic rise in inequality in recent decades has not ushered in an era of Republican fund-raising dominance. On the contrary, Democrats have made substantial gains against Republicans in recent decades while inequality was on the rise.\n\nIn a separate essay, published on the Scholars\u2019 Strategy Network, which discusses the implications of their work, Bonica and Rosenthal wrote:\n\nThe superrich control resources that parties and politicians require and, as a result, are courted. Politicians have incentives to pay attention to the policy concerns that animate wealthy donors on left and right alike \u2014 and this dynamic influences public discussion and policymaking.\n\nThe continued concentration of money at the top, they write, translates into more political power:\n\nThe ideas, values, and preferences of wealthy donors distort the focus of U.S. democracy more than individuals\u2019 desires to grow their already vast fortunes. Rather than worry about individual corruption, citizens and leaders should worry about the many ways money in politics can amplify the voices of the privileged few over those of the majority. As wealth concentration grows, so will uneven political influence.\n\nBonica has turned tracking campaign contributions by wealth and occupation into a specialty.\n\nHe provided The Times with data extending from 1980 to 2016 covering the contribution patterns of donors who gave the largest amount of money in each election cycle. (Roughly a quarter of Bonica\u2019s list overlaps with the Forbes 400 list.)\n\nIn the 1979-80 presidential election cycle, 71 percent of the top 400 donors gave to Republicans and to right-of-center political action committees, while 29 percent gave to Democrats and left-of-center PACS, a 42-point difference. In the 2015-16 presidential cycle, 54 percent gave to Republicans and right-leaning PACs, and 46 percent gave to Democrats, an 8-point difference.", "description": "Trump leads among small donors.
