This proclamation was rejected by the overwhelming majority of the world\u2019s Muslims.\n\nISIL had attempted to appropriate a title imbued with religious and political significance \u2013 and in doing so had cast a dark shadow over a rich history.\n\nThis is the story of the caliph, a title that originated 1,400 years ago and that spanned one of the greatest empires the world has ever known.", "description": "From foundation and evolution to dispute and division.
