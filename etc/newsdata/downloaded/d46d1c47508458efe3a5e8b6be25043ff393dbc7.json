Stop Renting A Modem.", "language": "en", "text": "If you\u2019re trying to save money by cord-cutting, you might have already ditched cable TV in favor of streaming services, such as Netflix and Hulu. After all, an estimated 33 million adults did so in 2018 alone. But if you maintained the same internet service (and, let\u2019s be real, of course you did), there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re still renting the modem from your cable provider. And if you\u2019ve had the same service for five years, well, be prepared to do some upsetting math.\n\nIt\u2019s possible to buy your own modem for a relatively small, one-time cost, which can save you as much as $156 on your bill in a single year. However, though it\u2019s generally the most cost-effective option, owning your own modem does come with a couple of gotchas.\n\nArman Zhenikeyev via Getty Images Using your own modem is the quickest way to cut your cable bill without losing services.\n\nShould You Buy Your Own Modem?\n\nYour internet setup will generally include two major pieces of equipment: a modem and a router. When signing up for internet service, the provider will usually send these items to you as rentals by default (some companies provide a two-in-one modem/router unit), with a separate line item in your bill. Unfortunately, the cost of renting a modem, and router if needed, is not exactly cheap.\n\nComcast is one of the latest internet service providers to once again raise its modem rental fee, most recently to $13 per month for the standard equipment. That means every year, Comcast customers pay $156 just to borrow a modem. And the company can decide to hike its rate again at any time.\n\nOther ISPs charge comparable fees. G.E. Miller, a blogger at 20somethingfinance.com, put together a helpful guide to ISP rental fees. After Comcast, Verizon Fios is the next most expensive, at $12 per month, while others hover around $10 per month.\n\nChanging ISPs is something you rarely do unless you move to a new city. So there\u2019s no need to keep renting a modem or router as long as you plan to keep your current provider for at least the next year.\n\nTo use your own modem, start by looking up your ISP\u2019s list of supported modems (if they offer this option, that is). Compatible equipment for many major ISPs can be found here:\n\nMost of these options cost less than $100 (modem/router combos can be a bit more), which means your equipment will pay for itself in just a few months to about a year.\n\nNext, swap in your new equipment. Your modem might automatically activate once you plug it in, but chances are you\u2019ll need to call up your ISP\u2019s customer support line and activate it. If you purchased a new router or modem/router combo, you\u2019ll also need to set up the wireless network before you can connect any devices.\n\nOnce you\u2019re all set up, send the rental equipment back to your ISP per their instructions. Be sure to ask for a receipt and verify that the rental charge has been removed from your next bill.\n\nBenefits Beyond Money\n\nIn addition to saving money on long-term rental fees, there are a couple of other good reasons to purchase your own modem, according to PC World.\n\nFor one, you can likely find a better modem than what your ISP provides by shopping around. The equipment provided by ISPs is often older, even used, and doesn\u2019t always support newer technology. That means you could boost your internet speeds and general performance by upgrading your modem, especially if you pay for a higher-tier internet package.\n\nOwning your modem also means you have full access to its controls, allowing you to monitor, troubleshoot and adjust the system if necessary. Rented modems, on the other hand, rarely allow you that kind of access, forcing you to rely on customer service if there\u2019s an issue.\n\nAre There Drawbacks To Buying Your Own Modem?\n\nDespite the many benefits of purchasing your own modem, there are a couple of downsides to consider first.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t using equipment provided by your ISP, they won\u2019t offer support if the modem stops working properly or breaks. The less technically inclined might feel it\u2019s worth it to pony up the rental fee. From a purely mathematical standpoint, however, we can assure you it\u2019s not. By the time your modem goes kaput, it should be much cheaper to simply replace it rather than have paid the monthly fees in exchange for troubleshooting or a replacement through the ISP.\n\nOne potential snag in the plan is that some ISPs may begin penalizing customers who choose to use their own modems as a way to make up for lost revenue. Comcast, for example, requires some customers to pay an extra $35 per month in other fees if they opt out of renting the company\u2019s controversial xFi Gateway equipment at $15 per month.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether other companies will employ the same strategy to push customers toward renting. One thing that is clear, however, is the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s stance on allowing customers to own their own modems. According to FCC regulations, ISPs can\u2019t bar customers from using their own equipment as long as it wouldn\u2019t cause harm to the provider\u2019s system.\n\nIt\u2019s generally recommended that if you do decide to buy your own modem and router that you purchase them separately. That way, you can make fixes and upgrades independently. However, there\u2019s no harm in buying a combo unit if simplicity is your goal.", "description": "You can buy one for less than $100.", "authors": ["Money", "Home", "Living Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9264422400003900d53072.jpeg?cache=5W7L5cwDEJ&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
