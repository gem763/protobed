TPUSA says that this way of presenting information is \u201cperfect for the busy millennial and gen-z American who\u2019s constantly on the go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a country infected with cancel culture and outrage mobs, we need to get back to a place where we can civilly present our best ideas and hash things out with our words, not our fists,\u201d said TPUSA and 180 contributor Rob Smith. \u201cI want to give you my best take on a topic and if you\u2019re not convinced, that\u2019s okay. At least you\u2019re thinking and considering what I have to say.\u201d\n\nThe 180 Series will release a new video every Wednesday, which will be uploaded to its new Facebook and Instagram pages and TPUSA\u2019s YouTube page, as well as cross-posted on other TPUSA social media accounts.\n\nThe debut video features Grover Norquist, who gives his argument in 180 seconds on why taxation should be limited to the absolute minimum by societies and governments.\n\nWatch the debut video below:\n\n\u201cRight now the government takes about a third of our income and spends it on our behalf. That doesn\u2019t have to be the case,\u201d said Norquist, who noted Americans had been paying 1 to 2 percent of their income in taxes \u2014 with temporary spikes during wars \u2014 until it spiked during World War II and never came back down.\n\n\u201cThe government decided, \u2018we have all this lovely money, why should we ever let the American people have it back just because the war\u2019s over?\u2019 and that\u2019s when we got up to 15 percent at the federal level, and now up to about 20 percent,\u201d continued Norquist.\n\nSome politicians are even calling for a 70 percent tax rate in the United States. We\u2019ve done that. It didn\u2019t work. That\u2019s why we stopped it. We even had 90 percent after World War II, and John F. Kennedy said 90 percent is ridiculous, it\u2019s slowing economic growth \u2014 they took it from 90 down to 70, and in the 1960\u2019s we had strong growth. Then Reagan came into office, he said 70 percent is too high, took it down to 50 [percent], down to 28 [percent]. Every time they cut the rates \u2014 the economy grew, because the American people were wealthier and more successful. We walked away from 90 percent, we walked away from 70 percent, and the whole world followed our model. We need to take a look at what worked.\n\nWhile the goal of The 180 Series is to change minds by convincing viewers to the presenter\u2019s way of thinking, TPUSA says that even if young people simply watch the videos with an open mind and don\u2019t change their opinions, the organization will still find the series successful, because young people would have a least heard the other side.\n\nThus, \u201ca positive cultural and political outcome is inevitable,\u201d said Turning Point USA.\n\n\u201cMost college students haven\u2019t thought critically about many of the topics we plan on presenting in these videos. This is mainly because they never hear about them from academics on college or high school campuses. I firmly believe that these are the ideas that will win the future,\u201d explains TPUSA founder and president Charlie Kirk.\n\n\u201cYoung people aren\u2019t opposed to the common-sense philosophy of freedom,\u201d added Kirk, \u201cthey just simply aren\u2019t exposed to it and 180 is designed to ensure they are.\u201d\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.", "description": "TPUSA has announced the launch of its new \"180\" digital video series featuring today's top political thinkers, who will share their most compelling argument on a political position in 180 seconds or less. \"The 180 Series\" debuted on Wednesday with its first video, featuring Americans for Tax Reform founder Grover Norquist.", "authors": ["Alana Mastrangelo"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/29058849988_b9d087b459_k-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
