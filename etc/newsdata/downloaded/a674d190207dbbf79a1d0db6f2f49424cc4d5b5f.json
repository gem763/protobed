REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo\n\nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE was 0.3% higher, with Shell (RDSa.L) and BP (BP.L) continuing to feel the benefit of the huge rise in oil prices since the attack on Saturday on the world's biggest processing plant.\n\nThe midcap FTSE 250 .FTMC fell 0.2% as of 0752 GMT, dragged down by a collapse in the shares of fertiliser maker Sirius Minerals after the company cancelled the bond tender at the heart of a crucial project in northern England.\n\nHeightened geopolitical worries and global slowdown concerns have sent investors flocking to so-called defensive sectors such as healthcare and tobacco stocks, ahead of a widely expected rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday.\n\nAstraZeneca (AZN.L), Diageo (DGE.L) and British American Tobacco (BATS.L) were among the biggest boosts on the main index.\n\n\u201cThere is a caveat, and that depends on whether we see further gains in the coming days, as investors look to possible retaliation, as well as the prospect that we could see further damage to output capacity,\u201d CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson said.\n\nOn the mid-cap, Sirius Minerals (SXX.L) plunged 52% to an all-time low after the fertiliser maker said it would scrap a planned $500 million bond sale as the British government declined to provide support to facilitate its financing.\n\nMeanwhile, Woodford Patient Capital Trust (WPCT.L) rose 2.8%. Its portfolio manager Woodford Investment Management reduced its stake in speciality biopharmaceutical company Circassia Pharmaceuticals (CIRCI.L) to less than 5%.\n\nCapping gains on the main bourse, housebuilders Taylor Wimpey (TW.L) and Persimmon (PSN.L) slipped more than 1.6% each after a government body criticised the Help to Buy scheme which makes it easier for first-time buyers to afford a home.\n\nAmong other London-listed companies, retailer French Connection (FCCN.L) slid 12% and recruiter Staffline (STAF.L) dropped 15.7% after downbeat half-year reports.", "description": "Britain's FTSE 100 steadied on Tuesday as oil heavyweights lifted the blue-chip index while the impact on other major sectors of the attack on Saudi crude processing facilities faded.", "authors": ["Yadarisa Shabong", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430751137&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G0HQ", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
