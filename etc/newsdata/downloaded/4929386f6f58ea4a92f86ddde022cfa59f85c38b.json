I didn\u2019t throw him out of my shop. I gently explained my beliefs, told him of other nearby floral shops, hugged him and wished him luck.\n\nHis friendship is important to me, even now. He and his partner and their feelings are important to me. But this was not about selling them a product. This was about investing part of me in celebrating something that conflicts with my faith.\n\nMy flowers come from a garden. But my talent for designing flowers comes from a much deeper place: my heart and soul. I can\u2019t separate my art from who I am. And if I were to create art celebrating an idea that runs counter to my deepest beliefs, I\u2019d be violating those beliefs.\n\nWhile the Washington Supreme Court doesn\u2019t get this, the U.S. Supreme Court seems to understand. Last year, in Janus v. AFSCME, the high court said that it is \u201calways demeaning\u201d to force someone to support messages they reject.", "description": "", "authors": ["Barronelle Stutzman", "Foxnews.Com Opinion Barronelle-Stutzman-Religious-Liberty-Supreme-Court"], "top_image": ""}
