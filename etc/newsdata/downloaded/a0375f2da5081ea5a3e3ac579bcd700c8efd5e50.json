In some areas (looking at you, San Francisco), renting is far more economical than buying a home. But renting can be used to fatten your credit profile as a steppingstone to your financial goals.\n\nMillennials want to buy but face barriers\n\nMillennials are delaying homeownership and staying in rentals longer than previous generations, multiple studies show.\n\nStudent debt \u2014 that bane of millennial existence \u2014 is one factor pushing back the age of homeownership. Rising rents and home prices coupled with slow wage growth also make it hard to save for a down payment.\n\nRead: This is the country\u2019s most popular rental market\n\nThe vast majority of Americans \u2014 9 out of 10 \u2014 still equate homeownership with personal success and economic security, according to a survey released in July by the website Apartment List. The survey of a nationally representative sample of people found both renters and homeowners believe there is a social stigma associated with renting.\n\nHow to make rent work for you\n\nYou cannot fully control how much money you make. But your credit score \u2014 the key to qualifying for rewards credit cards, financing a car or even a home \u2014 is largely under your control. Rent payments can be used to beef up your score.\n\nRelated: It makes more sense to rent than buy, but only if you live here\n\nFor many millennials, rent payments are a great way to demonstrate responsible behavior to potential creditors. But rent payments \u2014 unlike credit card, mortgage and loan payments \u2014 don\u2019t automatically appear on credit reports. And your credit scores rely on what\u2019s in your credit reports.\n\nThere are two ways to get rent added to your reports:\n\nAsk your landlord. Two of the three major credit bureaus \u2014 Experian EXPGY, -2.40% TRU, -2.54%\n\nTwo of the three major credit bureaus \u2014 Experian Do it yourself. You can use third-party companies such as RentTrack, Rock The Score and others to report rent payments directly to one or more bureaus for a monthly fee.\n\nA 2017 TransUnion study followed 12,000 renters for a year. Scores rose 16 points on average within six months after rent reporting began, says Maitri Johnson, vice president of multifamily at TransUnion. The largest increase was for scores below 620, generally considered bad credit.\n\nWith rent reporting, payments show up on your credit report like any other account. Positive payments help your score; missed or late payments can damage it. If there are errors, you can dispute them with the bureaus.\n\nWhat to know\n\nRent reporting lets you get credit for something you\u2019re already doing. Better credit can get you a cash-back credit card or a cheaper car loan, saving you money in the short term and strengthening your finances for the long term. But rent reporting also has some drawbacks:\n\nNot all credit scores factor in rent payments. FICO 8, the most widely used score by lenders, and the FICO versions used in mortgage lending do not use rental information to calculate scores. But newer versions, such as FICO 9 and FICO XD, do. VantageScore, FICO\u2019s FICO, -1.03%\n\nEven if it\u2019s not something considered in your score, it\u2019s still cosmetically on your credit report,\u201d says John Ulzheimer, a credit expert who has worked at Equifax and FICO. \u201cA lender considers information in good standing and that\u2019s going to benefit you as an applicant.\u201d\n\nMore: Follow this simple blueprint to manage your credit score\n\nReporting is not free. If you use a reporting service, you\u2019ll pay a monthly fee ranging from $6.95 to $9.95 depending on the company, plus a one-time enrollment fee of $25 to $95. Extras like adding past rental information cost more.\n\nOther ways to build credit\n\nUlzheimer points out that traditional credit-building methods are more effective than rent reporting: They don\u2019t cost much, payments are typically reported to all three credit bureaus, and they influence all types of FICO scores and VantageScores.\n\nYou can become an authorized user on someone else\u2019s credit card, preferably someone with a long history of responsible credit use.\n\nYou can get a secured credit card, which requires an upfront deposit. Charge a small amount on it every month and always pay on time.\n\nYou can apply for a credit-builder loan, available at credit unions. Your monthly payments are reported to the credit bureaus. The money you borrow is released to you once the loan is paid off.\n\nMore from NerdWallet:", "description": "Renting isn\u2019t all bad.
