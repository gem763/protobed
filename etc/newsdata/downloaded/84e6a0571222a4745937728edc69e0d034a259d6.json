LiquidApps names a range of potential examples of vCPU deployment, including tamper-resistant analyses of criminal evidence, securing data-based prediction models for elections, and unbiased distribution or partitioning of resources or land.\n\nAchieving mass adoption\n\nLiquidApps states in the release that \u201cbuilding DApps that are indistinguishable from traditional applications in terms of usability and speed is a prerequisite to mass adoption of blockchain technology.\u201d\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported previously in a dedicated analysis, whether a user\u2019s experience is joining a blockchain\u2019s network, interacting with a DApp during a prime-time rush, or breaking out from a centralized walled garden, the experience must be intuitive in order to achieve mass-market adoption.", "description": "LiquidApps has introduced a new blockchain scalability solution that can increase the decentralized processing power and capacity available to DApps developers", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9iMzJmYTU0NDFkNTQ4YTE2ZDQwOWNlZTdkZmIzYzBhMS5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
