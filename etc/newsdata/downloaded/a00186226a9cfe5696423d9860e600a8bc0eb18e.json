Buying fruit or veg in plastic bags rather than loose\n\n2. Leaving electronic items on standby\n\n3. Occasionally putting dirty recyclables into the bin instead of washing them out\n\n4. Taking your car instead of using public transport\n\n5. Chucking food waste in the bin rather than composting it\n\n6. Doing a load of washing at 40 degrees or hotter\n\n7. Forgetting to take reusable shopping bags to the shop\n\n8. Buying plastic water bottles instead of having a refillable one\n\n9. Buying carrier bags at the supermarket\n\n10. Driving distances you could easily walk\n\n11. Eating meat daily\n\n12. Throwing away food when it's only just past its use-by date\n\n13. Turning the heating on rather than putting on a jumper\n\n14. Throwing away and replacing things you could fix\n\n15.
