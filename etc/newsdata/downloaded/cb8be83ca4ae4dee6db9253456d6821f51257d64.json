REUTERS/Edgar Su/Files\n\nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore\u2019s September industrial production rose for the first time in five months, beating expectations, boosted by a surge in pharmaceutical output, data showed on Friday.\n\nManufacturing output rose 0.1% in September from a year earlier, data from the Singapore Economic Development Board showed, compared with a revised 6.4% contraction in August. The median forecast in a Reuters poll predicted a 4.1% fall.\n\nThis was the first time manufacturing output rose since April this year, when it also grew 0.1%, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nThe surprise rise was attributed to a rise in pharmaceutical production, which rose 26.2% in September from the year ago. In August, it rose 13.3% year-on-year.\n\nElectronics output, on the other hand, continued to see a contraction in September, slipping at 9.6% from the year-ago period, after reporting a 25% fall the month earlier.\n\nOn a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production also rose above expectations at 3.7% in September, after a revised 7.3% fall in August.
