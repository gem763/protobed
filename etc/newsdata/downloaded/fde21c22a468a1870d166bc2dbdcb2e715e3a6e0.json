I am going into it full on. I'm sure he will too but he has never faced anyone with the punching power of the lineal world heavyweight boxing champion.\n\n'I expect to knock him out the first time I connect with his chin. But if that doesn't happen then I'm ready to wrestle. I've prepared for anything and everything in the WWE gym.\n\n'If anyone thinks this game is fake they should try it. This is the most punishing, physical, painful training I've been through. I've not hurt my body so as to go out there and put on a mock fight or just clown around. Fighters in all combat sports want to win.\n\n'No wrestler wants to be embarrassed in the ring by a boxer. This will be real.'\n\nFury sustained a nasty cut in September during his last fight against Otto Wallin in Las Vegas\n\nFury is also at pains to deny he is doing this either to duck the huge Wilder rematch or for more fame. He says: 'Tell Deontay I won't get injured if I can help it, any more than he will in his dangerous fight with Luis Ortiz next month. He's next.\n\n'But now I've lost all that fat I'm a gym rat and I need to stay active. I grew up watching WWE and my son Prince loves it. It's not about being famous. I don't want to be a celebrity all my life.\n\n'All I'm interested in now is being with my family and life experiences, of which trying WWE is one. Boxing is my career because as a born fighting man I love its purity and clarity. But once it's all over I want to live a normal life.\n\nThe Crown Jewel event will take place at the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh\n\n'It will take a while for all the fuss to die down but whenever it does I can't think of anything better than walking around enjoying myself, without being recognised.'\n\nThat will seem a strange claim from a natural showman but the inference is that Fury performs with one good eye on the rewards of hyper-salesmanship.\n\nHe is understood to be earning $15million in the desert. That amount could double or even treble if he and Wilder come through their interim outings intact and ready to meet again, in Las Vegas on February 22.\n\nFury v Strowman at the WWE's Crown Jewel promotion in Riyadh will be televised live on Sky Sports Box Office.", "description": "JEFF POWELL: The Gypsy King's decision to jeopardise his world heavyweight championship rematch with Deontay Wilder by venturing into the realm of grunt and grapple raised eyebrows.", "authors": ["Jeff Powell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/14/20379706-0-image-a-6_1572445969003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
