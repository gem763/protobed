The Ashita Tomi proceedings should proceed and the litigation funders for the other two should be given an option to participate in the funding of Ashita Tomi as to one third each. If the option is not exercised by one, then Ashita Tomi and the other funder will share that one-third.\u201d\n\nThe bit in the middle was about too much time and money being wasted by law firms fighting over the same pot of money. (The Hammer was also never going to be happy about any matter taking an hour of his Friday list.)\n\n'Not viabIe': Investor Claim Partner's John Walker.\n\nAs it turns out one of the funders, Investor Claim Partner, walked.\n\n\"ICP declined principally on the basis that the claim had to include a period of trading in RCR shares which I didn\u2019t consider was viable,'' said ICP chief John Walker this week.\n\n\"IMF and Burford are now co-funding it.\"\n\nHearsay reckons there is nothing like multiple class actions to make a nonsense of the claim by plaintiff law firms that it's primarily about providing access to justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Bell pointed out, there was an unseemly rush to court registries after the disaster that was AMP at the Hayne royal commission, with five filing. Four ended up at the barrier after Maurice Blackburn took over Slater & Gordon\u2019s claim. The others were Quinn Emanuel. who filed first, Shine and Phi Finney McDonald.\n\nThe AMP case has been the catalyst for the courts to say enough. Judges are running a much closer eye over funding deals \u2013 no-win, no fee seems to have particular appeal \u2013 and when there are competing claims they are prepared to knock heads together.\n\nCough up\n\nThe week\u2019s other major decision in class action land was handed down by federal court judge Michael Lee in the Chandler McLeod-BHP claim.\n\nLee found the Fair Work Act's costs shield, which exempts parties from the usual obligation to pay costs if they lose, doesn\u2019t apply to litigation funders.\n\nThis means that UK funder Augusta Ventures will have to stump up an expected $2.1 million in security of costs before the case proceeds. (For Maurice Blackburn in the AMP litigation it's $5 million.)\n\nMonash University law professor Vince Morabito doesn't concur with those who say it will have a chilling effect on employment claims. He told Hearsay's colleague Hannah Wootton that they are picking up again and funders are increasingly taking out insurance for adverse cost orders anyway.\n\nHowever, the professor suspects the effect of rising premiums on the bottom line of funders might prompt them to ask courts for a greater proportion of settlements, which means less money for class members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJudgment day in Myer case\n\nIt's been a blight on the class actions landscape that no shareholder claim has ever proceeded to judgment.\n\nThat's about to change with word coming through this week that Justice Jonathan Beach is putting the finishing touches on his reasons in the TPT Patrol v Myer litigation and will deliver his judgment on October 24.\n\nThe case concerns the crux of most shareholder claims \u2013 an alleged failure to disclose information to the market which would have had a \"material\" effect on the share price.\n\nBeach reserved his judgment in December. He took the case on soon after finishing the Westpac bank bill swap case, so he\u2019s becoming a glutton for punishment.", "description": "Hearsay: Praise for Justice David Hammerschlag in a big week for class actions.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_149/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/833064cedd3832a33b447b5a15e66aca39058d9c", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
