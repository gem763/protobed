Pictures\n\nThis week\u2019s cinema includes Joker, the controversial anti-hero film starring Joaquin Phoenix. It\u2019s accompanied by a blaze of controversy and difficult publicity \u2013 but it\u2019s a must-see event.\n\nJudy sees Ren\u00e9e Zellweger relive the last days of Miss Garland on the London stage.\n\nGood Posture is a sharp literary comedy about a frosty English novelist and her aimless young American house-guest.\n\nFinally, the London Film Festival continues, with highlights including Knives Out, Le Mans \u201966, Rocks and The Irishman.\n\nJoker \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nLast month\u2019s surprise Golden Lion winner at the Venice Film Festival, director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s rivetingly dark reimagining of the classic Batman baddie\u2019s origin story combines mass-shooter topicality with a vintage Scorsese aesthetic.\n\nRead the full review\n\nNo joker: why Joaquin Phoenix walked out of our interview\n\nRobbie Collin: Films have inspired copycat violence for over a century \u2013 should we be worried about Joker?\n\nJudy \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\n\nRen\u00e9e Zellweger embodies a rake-thin, rasping Judy Garland, taking the London Palladium stage in her last months, supported by her husband (Finn Wittrock) and nervous assistant (Jessie Buckley).
