Usually when you have a \u201cderby game\" \u2014 and that\u2019s what today\u2019s fixture effectively is \u2014 you can make a case for the underdog winning, whatever the gulf in class between the two sides.\n\nThe Reds are high on confidence and have very few weaknesses, according to Souness\n\n'Sometimes you\u2019re banking on their sheer doggedness or passion to get a result. Those qualities, however, have been in short supply of late at Manchester United. Look at Liverpool\u2019s likely line-up, on the other hand, and it\u2019s hard to find the Achilles heel.\n\n'If Sadio Mane doesn\u2019t score then Mo Salah will, but don\u2019t for a moment think that Roberto Firmino is the junior partner in the offensive spearhead. His touch and running off the ball are the glue which holds that trio together.'\n\nSouness has also reserved criticism for United youth policy, saying the club have a 'fetish' of bringing youngsters through to the first team, warning that United won't be able to nuture these players if they are drafted into a squad low on confidence.\n\nThe pundit feels United's youth policy doesn't work as the current squad is too short on belief\n\n'Ever since the Busby Babes, the club have made a fetish out of youth,' he added. 'In itself, that is no bad thing, especially at a club which subsequently brought George Best through its ranks and then produced the Class of 92.\n\n'It\u2019s possible that the likes of Marcus Rashford, James Garner and Mason Greenwood might go on to emulate their illustrious predecessors \u2014 though I\u2019m sceptical \u2014 but just because they have been picked to start for United while they are still teenagers doesn\u2019t make it so.\n\n'The difficulty is compounded by the fact that they are being thrust into a team which is shorn of authority and confidence.'\n\nSouness said United lacked leaders such as Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Paul Scholes\n\nHe pointed out that the players coming through in the class of 92 were ready-made United stars and academy talents are not currently surrounded by leaders such as David Beckham and Paul Scholes.\n\n'With the exception of Ryan Giggs, who even at the age of 17 looked like a ready-made star, the class of 92 were slowly woven into the United fabric.\n\n'Solskjaer has no such luxury. Nor do the current crop of youngsters have the benefit of being surrounded by real leaders as David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers were in their professional infancy.\n\n'Harry Maguire could become such a leader but has his work cut out organising a defence which this season has had mediocrity as its highest aspiration.'", "description": "Jurgen Klopp's men head to Old Trafford having won every game this season, while United are struggling for confidence under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and have made their worst league start for 30 years.", "authors": ["Oli Gamp For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/12/19954644-0-image-a-12_1571571542530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
