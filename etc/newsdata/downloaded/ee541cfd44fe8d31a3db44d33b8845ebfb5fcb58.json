I would feel like a freak,\u201d the teenager wrote in an affidavit which was read out in court on Tuesday.\n\nThe bitter fight over hormone treatment for a child has also become a debate over parental rights, freedom of expression and informed consent.\n\nUnderscoring the broader implications of the court\u2019s decision, six groups \u2013 including LGBTQ advocacy organizations and conservative free speech activists \u2013 have been granted the right to provide submissions on behalf of the litigants.\n\nEighteen lawyers have taken part in the three-day hearing, including those representing public health officials, the local school board, as well as the teenager, his mother and his father.\n\nA publication ban prevents the identification of any family members or experts testifying.\n\nIn February a lower court ruled that the Infants Act, which gives wide latitude to a minor\u2019s ability to consent to medical procedures, permits the teen to receive hormone therapy at a Vancouver hospital.\n\nThe boy, who has the support of his mother, began taking hormones in March and now feels \u201camazing\u201d as a result of the treatment, his lawyers told the British Columbia court of appeals, the province\u2019s highest court. In addition to an improved self-image, he no longer has suicidal thoughts, they said.\n\nBut his father is determined to block the continuation of the hormone treatment, arguing that the lower court rushed prematurely to judgment.\n\nThe lower court also ordered the father use the child\u2019s chosen pronouns, meaning that if the father used his child\u2019s birth name, or referred to him as a girl, it would be viewed as family violence under the province\u2019s Family Law Act.\n\nThe child\u2019s name and birth certificate have been changed to reflect the fact he identifies as male. The father is also barred from speaking to media about the case due to a separate court ruling.\n\nThe father and his legal team have cast the case in terms of personal liberties, arguing in court filings that the court\u2019s order that he use his child\u2019s chosen identity amounts to \u201ctotalitarian interference\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a case about freedom of speech and the freedom to parent,\u201d Carey Linde, the father\u2019s lawyer, told the Guardian. He said his client is not opposed to the child\u2019s transition from female to male \u2013 but argues that too little is known about the effects of hormone treatment for the decision to be made by a minor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the right of a parent to participate in the discussion on that issue.\u201d\n\n'The system's violating everyone': the Canadian trans parent fighting to keep gender markers off cards Read more\n\nGroups advocating for the teen vehemently disagree, citing the Infants Act, which allows for a minors to consent to their own healthcare.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that for the purposes of assessing informed consent \u2026 a youth seeking gender affirming health care is to be treated \u2013 and must be treated \u2013 in the same way as any other youth seeking any other medical treatment,\u201d said the Canadian Professional Association for Transgender Health in a court filing.\n\nAdvocacy groups also accuse the father is using his son to promote \u201cconservative gender ideology\u201d, according to court filings.\n\nMedical experts have advised the court that because the child is midway through the hormone treatment, many of the effects are not reversible.\n\nThe panel of three judges overseeing the case is expected to make its ruling in the coming months.", "description": "A court case concerning a 14-year-old who identifies as a boy has sparked a debate over parental rights, free speech and informed consent", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bf883793f9369774fa1d0426a8e8325dfef3349/365_316_5017_3010/master/5017.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1462ee02de20921bf1656e2a5ecb816e", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
