The bill \u2014 which seeks to close loopholes allowing private or online sales of guns and sales at gun shows without background checks \u2014 was passed by the Democratic-controlled House in February.\n\nMcConnell has faced mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers and others to bring the legislation to the Senate floor, but he has yet to do so.\n\nThe majority leader \u201cshould bring up H.R. 8 the week Congress returns,\u201d Schumer said in a Saturday night tweet, hours after a gunman went on a shooting rampage in West Texas, killing multiple people and injuring at least 21. Three officers were among those who were injured, police said. A 17-month-old baby was also wounded in the attack.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Pelosi said later in a statement. \u201cEvery day, the epidemic of gun violence inflicts a devastating toll in communities in every corner of our country, forcing far too many to endure heartbreak and tragedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republican Senate must end its obstruction and finally pass the commonsense, bipartisan, House-passed gun violence prevention legislation that the country is demanding,\u201d she added.\n\nCongress will reconvene on Sept. 9 after its summer recess.\n\nOur thoughts are with the victims, their families, & everyone injured in the shooting in Odessa & Midland, TX.\n\n\n\nThank you to the first responders who risked their lives to stop the threat.@senatemajldr should bring up H.R. 8 the week Congress returns. We must #endgunviolence. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 1, 2019\n\nEnough is enough. Every day, the gun violence epidemic inflicts a devastating toll in communities across America, this time\n\nin West Texas. The @SenateGOP must end its obstruction & finally pass House-approved legislation to #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/RcoVI6Eebm \u2014 Nancy Pelosi (@SpeakerPelosi) September 1, 2019\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, also called on McConnell to do more.\n\n\u201cAmerica is done waiting for you,\u201d Warren, a 2020 presidential contender, tweeted.\n\nRep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) appealed to McConnell to move on H.R. 8 as well as H.R. 1112, another gun control bill passed by the House in February that would require a gun dealer to wait 10 days to hear back from federal authorities about a potential buyer\u2019s background check before moving ahead with a gun sale.\n\nTime\u2019s up, @SenateMajLdr. Let\u2019s vote on gun safety legislation NOW. Every day you wait, more tragedies happen.\n\n\n\nDo something, Senator McConnell. America is done waiting for you. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 1, 2019\n\nI\u2019m thinking tonight of those who lost their lives in Odessa and Midland and the loved ones they left behind. It\u2019s abundantly clear that we must take action to curb gun violence in this country.@senatemajldr allowing votes on HR8 and HR1112 would be a good start. \u2014 Rep. Katie Porter (@RepKatiePorter) September 1, 2019\n\nAnother horrific mass shooting in Texas. I\u2019m heartbroken for the victims in Odessa and Midland and their families.\n\n\n\nHow many more times will the Senate do nothing? It\u2019s time to end our gun violence epidemic. @senatemajldr, will you stand up for families and let the Senate vote? \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (@gillibrandny) September 1, 2019\n\nThe hashtag #MassacreMitch started trending on Twitter on Saturday as people called on the senator to take action against gun violence.\n\nThe hashtag also went viral in August following back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nAt least 5 dead/21 wounded in #Odessa/#Midland. 2nd mass shooting in Texas in a month. And look, it was NOT the invading hoard!\n\n\n\nMore notches for #MassacreMitch\u2019s & @GregAbbott_TX\u2019s belts.\n\n\n\nThat NRA taint must taste SO delicious for the @SenateGOP to continue to do nothing. pic.twitter.com/nqiGmBYcQa \u2014 (((evan shap\u012bro))) (@eshap) August 31, 2019\n\nA bill for universal background checks has already been passed by the House and has bipartisan support in the Senate.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s supported by 93% of Americans.\n\n\n\nOne man has stood in its way of getting a vote. #MassacreMitch\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time for him to go. pic.twitter.com/kc2M22FoRN \u2014 MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) September 1, 2019\n\nNobody gives a fuck if you were briefed by your fixer. We want gun violence addressed NOW! Order #MassacreMitch to bring Congress back and get off the fucking golf course. https://t.co/iRO0SPoHH7 \u2014 Morgan J. Freeman (@mjfree) August 31, 2019\n\nNot one peep from #MassacreMitch since the #OdessaShooting. Texas mourns. America mourns. McConnell\u2019s mute. Mitch McConnell\u2019s legislative malpractice has resulted in absolute failure to move on #GunReform. Trump, McConnell, and the GOP grab their gun lobby money & run, run, run. \u2014 Stephanie Kennedy (@WordswithSteph) September 1, 2019", "description": "Democratic leaders are pushing the Senate majority leader to take action on gun control legislation. \"Enough is enough,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.", "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6ba1253b0000e000cabf4f.jpeg?cache=7kvmikkkqb&ops=1778_1000"}
