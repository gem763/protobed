Meanwhile, the wild gyrations continue. This time, there was a sense of urgency that the train was leaving the station, which powered early buying. Some of the individual moves higher were astonishing. Of course, many of these names have been hammered and still remain underwater for the year.\n\nWe got rotation out of bonds and equity safe havens, but after breaking the Walls of August, the next big test will be getting back to all-time high levels.\n\nTo make that happen, yesterday\u2019s session served as a great template for what leadership should look like: beaten down Industrial names, and perhaps new leadership from Financials.\n\nS&P 500 Index +1.30% Communication Services (XLC) +1.70% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) +1.91% Consumer Staples (XLP) -0.62% Energy (XLE) +1.24% Financials (XLF) +2.04% Health Care (XLV) +0.99% Industrials (XLI) +1.80% Materials (XLB) +0.16% Real Estate (XLRE) -0.87% Technology (XLK) +2.09%\n\n\n\nEconomic Proxies\n\nOnce again, there was another sizeable drawdown of crude inventories.

It reminded me of the debacle called World Online, which I still say silently that it triggered \u2018popping\u2019 of the tech and telecom bubble.\n\nYesterday, the company\u2019s pre-IPO valuation was sliced to $25 billion from $47 billion a week earlier. Yikes!\n\nToday\u2019s Jobs report, I think, must be good news and should be treated as good news if my guesstimate is correct.\n\n175,000 are worried about goods-producing (dirty fingernail) jobs.\n\nWe are hoping for another spike in participation like July:\n\nWhite: +97,000\n\nHispanic: +84,000\n\nBlack: +284,000\n\nToday's Session\n\nNon-Farm Payroll", "description": "Yesterday, the market finally broke out of a vice-grip trading .09/06/2019 22:09:34PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/306/d8304da9-4a75-44f5-aad6-6ce0cba52420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
