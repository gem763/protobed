He is the king of blunders.\u2019\n\nThis was after the German clumsily gave away a penalty late in the game, allowing Spurs to equalise and come away with a draw from a game in which they scarcely troubled the Gunners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven months later, the comment from the Frenchman is still irking Mustafi, as he told German publication Der Spiegel: \u2018That annoyed me a lot.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s one thing when fans or the media criticise you. But it\u2019s something completely different when an ex-player, who knows how hard it is sometimes on the field, says something like that.\n\nEmmanuel Petit is not a fan of Shkodran Mustafi (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018I expect those players to be more sensitive and to see what this sharp criticism can do.\n\n\u2018In the past, it might have been in the paper for a day and then people would have forgotten. Today it\u2019s on the internet and it\u2019s going to haunt me for the rest of my career.\n\n\u2018Actually, former players like Petit shouldn\u2019t need to make a name for themselves by making condescending comments about current players.\u2019\n\nMustafi has played three matches so far this season, against Eintracht Frankfurt, Standard Liege and Nottingham Forest, and has kept a clean sheet in all three contests.\n\nHowever, this has not stopped the criticism pouring in, with the hapless defender being voted the second worst defender in the world, only behind Manchester United\u2019s Phil Jones, in a poll run by Spanish outlet Marca.\n\nDer Spiegel asked the Germany international if he thought he was the second worst defender on Planet Earth, to which he replied: \u2018No, I do not think so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I would think about it more seriously if it had been a survey among the best coaches in Europe.\n\n\u2018In the first two years after my move to Arsenal in 2016, things went very well for me. I saw myself as a top performer. But shortly after Christmas 2018 there was a kink.\n\n\u2018I made a few mistakes and they produced a reaction that I\u2019ve never experienced before.\u2019\n\nMORE: Lille chief Luis Campos explains why Nicolas Pepe will be a success at Arsenal\n\nMORE: Lucas Torreira refuses to give up on winning starting place back at Arsenal", "description": "Arsenal defender Shkodran Mustafi has fired back at Emmanuel Petit after the former Gunners star described him as the 'king of blunders'.
