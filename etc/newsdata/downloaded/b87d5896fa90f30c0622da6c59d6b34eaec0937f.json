The operating income of the unit was 428.9 billion won, a 3.8 percent increase on-year on cost reductions and lower raw material prices.Its mobile communications division posted 1.52 trillion won revenue in the third quarter. Its operating loss stood at 161.2 billion won, but the loss was far less than the previous quarter\u2019s 313 billion won loss.As the company relocated its mobile manufacturing from Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, to Vietnam earlier this year, costs have fallen, which is seen to have contributed to the reduced loss. But the mobile communications division has been suffering losses for 18 consecutive months since the second quarter of 2015.Expensive 5G equipment and low demand for 5G handsets contributed to the loss, according to a spokesperson from LG Electronics during a conference call on Wednesday.\u201cBut we are forging strategic partnerships with related operators, and believe we could pioneer the market next year before Apple enters the 5G market.\u201dRestrictions against Huawei in Europe will set the stage for LG Electronics to raise its presence in that market, the spokesperson argued. The company said it will expand original development manufacturing of low- to mid-priced smartphones.BY JIN MIN-JI [jin.minji@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
