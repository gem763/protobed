Earnest, 20, will appear in court on Oct. 3 for his arraignment on murder and attempted murder charges stemming from the April 27 shooting in the Chabad of Poway.\n\nHe will also be tried on an arson charge for a March 24 blaze at Dar-ul-Arqam Mosque, also known as the Islamic Center of Escondido.\n\nEarnest could face the death penalty if he is convicted of murder as a hate crime. The San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office has not decided whether it will pursue capital punishment.\n\nLEADERS STRUGGLE TO MAKE SENSE OF FATAL ATTACK ON SYNAGOGUE\n\nProsecutors allege Earnest entered the synagogue on the last day of Passover and killed 60-year-old Lori Gilbert Kaye. Kaye was shot twice and died at a hospital.\n\nThe congregation's rabbi, Yisroel Goldstein, 57, lost a finger in the shooting. Almog Peretz, 34, and his 8-year-old niece, Noya Dahan, were also injured.\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors played a 12-minute 911 call of the gunman telling a dispatcher that he'd shot up the synagogue to save white people from Jews.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re destroying our people. I\u2019m trying to show them that we\u2019re not going to go down without a fight,\u201d said the caller on the 911 recording, who identified himself as Earnest. \"I\u2019m defending our nation against the Jewish people, who are trying to destroy all white people.\"\n\nHe said he would not use his weapon on responding officers.\n\nOscar Stewart, 51, who was present during the shooting with his wife and stepdaughter, said during the hearing that\u201cpeople were falling over each other. It was chaos.\"\n\nHe was standing in the back of the synagogue when shots rang out, he said. An Army and Navy veteran who served two tours in Iraq, Stewart said he rushed the gunman and yelled that he was going to kill him in an effort to distract him.\n\nHe chased after the fleeing gunman and pulled back when off-duty Border Patrol agent Johnathan Morales, who was working security, fired about five shots at the assailant.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarnest was arrested a short time later. He reportedly admitted being behind the shooting and the mosque blaze two weeks earlier.\n\nAuthorities said he posted an open letter citing his hatred for Jews and his admiration for a man accused of killing 50 people in Christchurch, New Zealand, mosques in March.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A man accused of\u00a0opening\u00a0fire in a San Diego-area synagogue, killing a woman and wounding three other people, will stand trial, a judge ruled Friday.", "authors": ["Louis Casiano"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19262781725586.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
