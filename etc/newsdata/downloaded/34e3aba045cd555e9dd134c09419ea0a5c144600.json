The entire operation will cost the Spanish government up to 63,000 euros ($70,000).\n\nThe family disputed the exhumation in courts but the Supreme Court rejected their appeal last month.\n\nThe funeral home tasked with moving Franco's remains has not been named for its own safety, the sources said, adding that some of the companies involved in the operation had received death threats.\n\nThe Valley of the Fallen mausoleum holds the bodies of 34,000 Spaniards who died during the war, including many from the losing Republican side whose bodies were moved there during Franco's rule without the permission of their families.\n\nNeither media nor the public will be allowed to watch the proceedings, in preparation of which the government shut the Valley of the Fallen, which is due to reopen on Oct. 29.\n\nThe location of Franco's tomb continues to fracture Spanish opinion with 43% in favor of the move and 32.5% against, according to a poll published by El Mundo earlier this month.\n\nSpain is facing its fourth election in four years in November and moving Franco's remains from the state mausoleum had long been a Socialist pledge.\n\n($1 = 0.8969 euros)\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Clara-Laeila Laudette; Writing by Jessica Jones; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Lisa Shumaker)", "description": "Spain will on Thursday remove the 1.5-tonne slab which has covered the tomb of dictator Francisco Franco for the past 44 years and fly his remains by helicopter away from a state mausoleum, government sources told reporters on Monday.
