His office secretly coordinated with the source of this laughable impeachment inquiry. Help me stop it.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are expected to force a vote on a resolution to censure Schiff after the current recess over how he summarized Trump\u2019s call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, which Schiff noted at the time was meant to be at least in part a parody.\n\n\u201cI felt [that] was extremely demeaning and misleading to the American people and misrepresented the facts,\u201d Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), who is leading the censure resolution, told The Hill.\n\nDemocrats have defended Schiff, arguing whistleblowers routinely reach out to the Intelligence Committee and that his staff followed protocol by telling them to contact the inspector general. A spokesman for Schiff has also said that the committee didn't review the whistleblower complaint in advance, and that Schiff knew neither the details of the complaint nor the whistleblower's identity.\n\nRepublicans are dealing with mounting problems of their own despite the impeachment inquiry being less than two weeks old. Trump sparked a new phase of the scandal when, speaking to reporters outside the White House, he suggested both China and Ukraine should investigate the Bidens.\n\nTrump is doubling down on his criticism of Biden, with his campaign and Republican National Committee putting $10 million behind an ad questioning Biden\u2019s role in the firing of a prosecutor. There\u2019s no evidence Biden pushed for the prosecutor\u2019s removal to protect his son.\n\n\u201cThey lost the election, now they want to steal this one,\u201d the ad's narrator says.\n\nIn another ad, the campaign said the \u201cswamp is trying to take him out.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats released text messages late Thursday night showing several administration officials indicating that a meeting between the Ukrainian president and Trump may have been contingent on investigations requested by the United States, underscoring how the administration pushed for Ukraine to take up investigations related to the 2016 election and the Bidens.\n\nBut Republicans believe Democrats are overplaying their hand, predicting that the move could pay political dividends in swing districts and states in 2020. Though overall support for impeaching Trump has ticked up over the past week, a CNBC All-America Economic Survey found that 88 percent of Republicans still opposed impeaching Trump.\n\nMcConnell has been running ads pitching himself, and a GOP-controlled Senate, as a firewall to Trump being removed from office. The video ad, which began running three days after Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry, makes no reference to Trump publicly encouraging a foreign government to investigate a potential 2020 rival.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiBiden: Trump has 'indicted himself by his own statements' House Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents House conservatives press Schiff over knowledge of whistleblower complaint MORE's in the clutches of a left-wing mob.

Republicans view the potential vote as a political boon that would force Democrats from swing districts to go on the record.\n\n\u201cDemocratic House members cannot be allowed to hide behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi when it comes to an impeachment inquiry of President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE.
