He insisted he should have more money he was \u2018owed\u2019.\n\nI gave him \u00a38,000 from my NHS pension because of his inheritance expectations. He didn\u2019t understand there was no money to inherit \u2014 since the costs of the funeral were more than expected. He accused me of spending too much \u2014 but I told him Mum\u2019s money was stipulated for care and funeral costs.\n\nOn our last phone call in May he was really awful \u2014 demanding more money. A bully. Threatening behaviour.\n\nThought of the day Lives of great men all remind us We can make our lives sublime, And, departing, leave behind us Footsteps on the sands of time... Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (U.S. poet 1807-1882)\n\nI advised him to get a solicitor (he\u2019d have to pay!) and not to contact or visit me.\n\nOver the past five to ten years, he had a lot of money from Mum \u2014 never paying back.\n\nHis money problems are endless. He\u2019s married with two children, living in a council house with never enough.\n\nHis children showed no interest in Mum, who was never allowed to be a grandmother. He was very hurtful to her; my impression was that he was interested only in her money.\n\nThese issues mean I\u2019d now prefer not to be involved with him and his family. Certainly not the wife \u2014 who is heavily influencing him to act and l think has been encouraging him to demand money. I think it\u2019s very stressful for him and suspect he can\u2019t cope mentally.\n\nI was Mum\u2019s full-time carer and I\u2019m not working now. I decided to have some time out and bereavement counselling. Before being a carer I was a qualified nurse and have financial security from my pension.\n\nI\u2019m feeling very angry about all this \u2014 betrayed, in fact. I would love some advice.\n\nMARGARET\n\nThis week Bel advises a woman who has fallen out with her brother over her mother's inheritance\n\nTHIS is a difficult hand to play \u2014 and is a problem I know well: a sibling more like a creature from another planet than a product of the same parents.\n\nAlthough you two finally fell out in May this year, you were probably having difficulties for years. Your mother\u2019s death and funeral may have triggered a hostility not far below the surface. Am I right?\n\nSibling issues are hardly new to this column. Inevitably, I say: don\u2019t look backwards; accept a family relationship may be over but leave the door open at the same time; and vow to step outside the family and control your own life.\n\nMoney is so often the poisonous serpent in the family garden \u2014 yet if siblings already have a good relationship I doubt filthy lucre would corrupt it. But if they\u2019ve not really got on, the stage is set for a terminal disruption.\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve said, I suspect this situation is unmendable. You despise your brother for sponging off your mother when she was alive and believe he has done little with his life. You dislike his wife and feel angry she did not encourage her children to have a good (or any) relationship with their grandmother.\n\nThe final straw was this man whingeing about money when your mother was barely in her grave, so that he sponged off you (\u00a38,000 is a lot of money) as he did your mother. No wonder you don\u2019t want to speak to him again.\n\nYet when you mention his \u2018stress\u2019 and mental health, I detect a note of pity. Who knows whether, in the future, you and he might become reconciled?\n\nSometimes, in families, an immediate break is necessary. Toxicity is draining and, anyway, isn\u2019t this the point when, having been a good daughter and carer, you need to make a new start?\n\nYou need to recognise that you\u2019re probably feeling a double whammy of grief: for your mother (obviously), but also for the brother you\u2019d have liked to have had. Feeling \u2018very angry\u2019 will do you no good; rage and resentment just serve to turn the key in the lock on the unhappy present.\n\nWhat you need is to open that door and cut loose.\n\nWhat will you do now? You are a retired nurse with an NHS pension \u2014 and this country is crying out for skills like yours. Have you thought of returning to your profession in some capacity?\n\nWould it not take your mind off your mother and your brother \u2014 as well as money \u2014 to investigate ways and means?\n\nYou could not help your mother\u2019s decline and death, nor your brother\u2019s unpleasant greed. But you can now be in control of your own life. For all I know, you may already be making these plans. Have a look at this website: healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/nursing/returning-nursing and see if it triggers some ideas.\n\nAnd another website might help you by sharing the experiences of others: allnurses.com/ retired-nurses-c160\n\nI wish you positivity and peace.\n\nI\u2019ve thrown out my straying husband\n\nDear Bel,\n\nI read your column every Saturday to find support for my problem \u2014 one which I blew wide open recently.\n\nI\u2019ve been married for 27 years and after many years of wondering if my husband had someone else, he had become careless and I found clues. So I dug deeper and started monitoring his activities when he went away on business weekends.\n\nThe breaking point came when I drove more than 100 miles to a hotel where I knew he was staying on business. There he was with this other woman walking into the bar for a pre-dinner drink.\n\nNow I have locked him out of our home and he has sat outside wanting to talk, sometimes pleading, sometimes threatening. He claims the woman is his best friend and there is no romance, only mutual interest in her hobby.\n\nShe is a collector and he is a dealer in an antique specialty, and he has been taking her (instead of me) to weekend fairs and auctions for the past (possibly) ten years.\n\nI used to go with him before this friendship started. I forgot to say he is nearly 75 years old, and sadly I still love him. But do I want to take him back and spend the remainder of my life wondering?\n\nNORA\n\nYour email subject line was \u2018pensioners in crisis\u2019, leaving no doubt about the seriousness of this moment of acute pain in your life. Which way will you go?\n\nI doubt any reader (at least the female ones) will blame you for suspicions which seem to be well-founded. Your husband can deny he was having an affair with the woman all he likes \u2014 yet such attention paid, so many meetings, such shared interests (and presumably confidences) and worst of all so many lies. What can one think?\n\nA person can be unfaithful even if sex has never happened. The \u2018romance\u2019 lies in the stories told and the trysts.\n\nSo what can you do? As a regular reader of this column, you will know that I often counsel forgiveness and new starts. Why? Because a marriage is a huge thing to throw away because one of the partners has been a deceitful fool.\n\nSometimes a marriage just has to end because it has run its course. Yet \u2014 especially when you are older and contemplate the whole pack of cards falling about your ears and then a future in unaccustomed solitude \u2014 it is wise to consider whether the end is inevitable. You love your husband and clearly want him back. If he wishes to come back home, then the terms are yours to set.\n\nFirst, though, you have to ask yourself why you stopped going to the fairs with him. There was a process there, of which you were a part. I find it hard to believe he just suddenly refused; you need to ask yourself whether in fact you lost interest in his dealing and preferred to stay put. It won\u2019t alter the present, but people who suspect their partners have sometimes played their own part in the sequence of events.\n\nIf I were you, I would insist the pair of you seek counselling (relate.org.uk) as an urgent condition of his return. Even if he continues to insist there was no \u2018romance\u2019, the Relate counsellor will surely ask him to consider the effect of his behaviour on you, his wife.\n\nI\u2019ve changed your name but I think you should show him this letter on the page to indicate the seriousness of his behaviour.\n\nThen ask him how he sees the future. I just hope that soon you will be travelling off to auctions together and rebuilding your marriage. And that the woman who has been the cause of your pain will disappear in search of something unusual and appealing to add to her collection \u2014 which isn\u2019t somebody else\u2019s husband.\n\nA HEARTFELT PLEA from a reader . . .\n\nDear Bel,\n\nBetty and I met in Glasgow in 1954 when I was 11 and she was 24 and a mum of three. We were very close even after she moved to Tamworth in Staffordshire in the Sixties. Eventually, she told me in one phone call she had memory problems. I continued to phone; she always chatted happily, even with Alzheimer\u2019s. In 2017, her phone was no longer answered. I tried repeatedly. No reply. I sent my usual Christmas card saying I really wanted contact. No reply. I\u2019m now 76 and she\u2019d be 89. It really hurts not to know what happened to Betty. She may no longer remember me, but my heart remembers her.\n\nCould you please ask families of older relatives with this sad illness to let distant friends know if their relative moves away or dies? We still care and want to know.\n\nThank you.\n\nSHEENA, Galston, Scotland\n\nAnd finally...Why we all need some good news\n\nI don\u2019t often have a mini meltdown and this one was sorrow. Last Sunday, I was horrified and moved by the harrowing storylines in BBC1\u2019s gripping new serial about World War II, World On Fire.\n\nIt\u2019s my custom to watch the 10pm news every night, but I switched off after eight minutes because it was unbearable: the killing, the bombs, the grief, the anger, the hatred, the evil. All over again; this time Kurds, Turks and Syrians. And on and on; lives destroyed by conflict.\n\nSometimes it feels hard to continue ordinary life, fretting about this and that, while all the time implacable forces are waged against each other all over the world \u2014 and we\u2019re shown images of women and children fleeing, stumbling with belongings in bundles, as they have for hundreds of years.\n\nContact Bel Bel answers readers' questions on emotional and relationship problems each week. Write to Bel Mooney, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT, or email bel.mooney@dailymail.co.uk. A pseudonym will be used if you wish. Bel reads all letters but regrets she cannot enter into personal correspondence.\n\nThat evening I walked out into the darkness to seek consolation in the harvest moon hanging in the sky; utterly beautiful, pure, distant \u2014 and pitiless.\n\nUsually the natural world can offer consolation \u2014 but not that night. Oh, I admit other things were going on in my life. My daughter Kitty was unwell and I felt so worried. My charity SANDS\u2019s support of Baby Loss Awareness Week had brought back sad memories (sands.org.uk/baby-loss-awareness-week).\n\nLast of all, I was feeling depressed by British politics and the never-ending saga of Brexit. Sometimes it all rolls together into a great boulder and flattens you, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nBut then I read a lovely warm email from Jennie E. who said: \u2018Thank you, Bel, you keep me inspired to continue trying to be the best I can be, to keep a smile on my face\u2026\u2019 And she sent a picture of her \u2018angels\u2019: three beautiful grandchildren, \u2018to put a smile on your face\u2019. It did!\n\nThen on Facebook Julia W. posted on my timeline: \u2018The world seems very scary right now. Have you ever looked at the website humanprogress.org? It\u2019s immensely cheering xx\u2019.\n\nSo I visited the site full of good news and, yes, felt much better.
