That has gone.\"\n\nThe Commons vote on the deal appears poised on a knife edge, with Mr Johnson's former allies in the DUP saying they will oppose it.\n\nDUP clashes with PM over Brexit deal\n\nDUP leader at Westminster Nigel Dodds argued there must be \"Brexit for the whole of the United Kingdom\", leaving the single market and customs union as one.\n\nIn a sideswipe at the PM, Mr Dodds said: \"In order to avoid an extension he has been too eager by far to get a deal at any cost.\"\n\nThe SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: \"The prime minister has returned from Brussels to present a deal that he knows, that we all know is actually worse than Theresa May's deal.\n\n\"A deal that would see Scotland shafted by this United Kingdom government, left at an economic disadvantage, with Scotland's views totally disregarded by this prime minister and his government.\"\n\nLetwin: Amendment is insurance policy\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said: \"The prime minister's deal removes protections on workers' rights, it puts a border down the Irish Sea and according to the government's own analysis will damage our economy on a scale greater than the financial crash.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru Westminster Leader Liz Saville Roberts said: \"How could Plaid Cymru ever support his billionaires' Brexit?\"\n\nMeanwhile, a group of cross-party MPs have sent a letter to Chancellor Sajid Javid calling on him to release economic impact assessments for the proposed Brexit deal ahead of Saturday's vote.\n\nImage: Actors Paul McGann and Sir Patrick Stewart join protesters at the People's Vote march\n\nThousands of protesters taking part in a People's Vote march converged on Westminster ahead of a rally demanding a further referendum on the PM's agreement.\n\nBack in the Commons, Caroline Flint, the Labour MP for the Brexit-backing South Yorkshire seat of Don Valley, branded the Letwin amendment as \"a panic measure\" aimed at delaying and ultimately stopping the UK leaving the EU.", "description": "Opponents are threatening to vote for an amendment withholding approval until legislation to implement the deal is in place.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://e3.365dm.com/19/10/1600x900/skynews-boris-johnson-commons-brexit_4809269.jpg?20191019094058", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
