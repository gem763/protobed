Blind people can\u2019t, they said. People who are blind and deaf certainly can\u2019t.\n\nIt turns out, though, that determination (or \u2018sheer stubbornness\u2019, as she puts it) can triumph over disability.\n\nAlexandra went skiing \u2014 and not just on the baby slopes. She went full throttle. Frankly, it sounds suicidal.\n\n\u2018I have no vision in one eye and just 5 per cent in the other, so I couldn\u2019t see anything except white,\u2019 she admits, cheerfully.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t see where the ice patches were, or the rocks. But I ended up training with the GB Paralympics team.\n\n\u2018I had a guide who went in front and we communicated via Bluetooth headphones linked to my hearing aids. He\u2019d say: \u201cIce patch on the right!\u201d or: \u201cSharp left coming up!\u201d It\u2019s about trust, really, and teamwork.\u2019\n\nNow 25, Alexandra is on a very different slalom course, where the risks are even higher. If she and her new \u2018support team\u2019 \u2014 her colleagues in the NHS \u2014 get it wrong here, it\u2019s not her life that will be in danger, but those of other people.\n\nShe is a fourth-year medical student, on track to become the first doctor in Britain who is registered both deaf and blind.\n\nAlexandra understands that the mere mention of a deaf and blind doctor pulls everyone up short. Even those directly involved in her training don\u2019t seem to have got their heads around it.\n\nShe tells me about one meeting, in her first year at medical school, where she was summoned to discuss her needs. She was painfully aware that all the eyes in the room were on her white cane.\n\nWell-meaning folk used to tell Alexandra Adams she couldn\u2019t ski. But Alexandra went skiing \u2014 and not just on the baby slopes. She went full throttle. Frankly, it sounds suicidal\n\n\u2018Someone said: \u201cThis table has quite sharp corners, be careful because we don\u2019t need any extra paperwork,\u201d \u2019 she recalls. \u2018I didn\u2019t say anything because, you never know, maybe they were trying to be helpful.\n\n\u2018Afterwards, though, I ran down the stairs without my cane to make a point. But, at the bottom, it was quite dark and I ended up feeling along the wall for my way out. They were all watching.\n\n\u2018One said: \u201cHow do you expect to be a doctor if you can\u2019t find a door handle?\u201d \u2019\n\nShe adds: \u2018Of course, they don\u2019t understand how someone who is deaf and blind can be a doctor because it hasn\u2019t happened yet. I\u2019d like to change that.\u2019\n\nAlexandra will have her work cut out. It\u2019s clear that her would-be profession hasn\u2019t exactly welcomed this young woman, so determined to be a trailblazer.\n\nAlexandra will have her work cut out. It\u2019s clear that her would-be profession hasn\u2019t exactly welcomed this young woman, so determined to be a trailblazer\n\n\u2018In the medical school, people have been more accepting,\u2019 she says, \u2018but senior doctors out in the real world have been quite dismissive. I\u2019ve been mistaken for a patient because I have a cane.\n\n\u2018On my first day on the wards, I was told not to touch a patient and sent home. In my third year, a senior doctor asked me: \u201cWould you want to be treated by a disabled doctor?\u201d And I\u2019ve been called an invalid! People hear \u201cblind/deaf doctor\u201d and they think: \u201cShe\u2019s going to butcher me.\u201d I\u2019m not going to butcher anyone. I don\u2019t even want to be a surgeon, for goodness\u2019 sake.\u2019\n\nI meet Alexandra at her home in Cardiff on a day when she is dashing between ward work and classes. We go for lunch in the pub at the end of her road. Her folding cane tap-taps the way.\n\nAt the table, she can\u2019t read the menu, not even up close, but she takes photos and enlarges the print on her phone. Her smartphone is vital: she has a high- tech stethoscope that connects to her hearing aid via Bluetooth (meaning she can hear a heartbeat). Soon, she will pick up a new otoscope, the device doctors use to look in ears. This version features a slot for an iPhone that will magnify the image.\n\nShe was two when she got her first hearing aid\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been in touch with five doctors in America who are completely blind, and I learned a lot about the technology there,\u2019 says Alexandra. \u2018There\u2019s another who is profoundly deaf, and he\u2019s a cardiologist, albeit one who\u2019s never been able to hear a heartbeat.\u2019\n\nHas she ever heard of a blind and deaf doctor though, anywhere in the world? \u2018No. But that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t happen.\u2019\n\nYou don\u2019t have to spend long with Alexandra to realise that this is an extraordinary young woman who was never going to be satisfied with an easy life.\n\nDoctors knew straight away she was blind (a medical degree would help in understanding her visual issues, which include something called microphthalmia, a dislocated lens, cataracts and nystagmus); her deafness was diagnosed \u2018when Mum and Dad realised the dog was barking next to me and I didn\u2019t react\u2019.\n\nHer father is an engineer, her mother a physiotherapist. She credits them with \u2018making me believe I could do anything. They are amazing, and I probably don\u2019t tell them enough\u2019.\n\nAlexandra\u2019s speech is fluent, most unusual in someone deaf since birth. She credits her mum, who would \u2018hold balloons between us and say every word so I would feel the vibrations\u2019.\n\nShe was two when she got her first hearing aid. \u2018The old ones came with big boxes that you had to wear round your neck, but as they became more streamlined, they got better. Each one meant adjusting, though, which was always hard.\n\n\u2018Even now, if I get a new one, everyone sounds like Darth Vader at first, but the difference they make is amazing.\u2019 The one she wears today is tiny and nestles almost unseen in her ear. Each upgrade has stunned her. \u2018When I got this one, I kept hearing a click I didn\u2019t recognise. It was the mouse on my computer. I wasn\u2019t even aware it made a click.\u2019\n\nShe never formally learned to lip-read, but says: \u2018It\u2019s certainly easier if someone is in front of me. Even with the hearing aid, I struggle in places with background noise.\u2019\n\nGrowing up in Kent, Alexandra was a bright and inquisitive child, and a favourite toy was her medical set. Her parents were keen that she stayed in mainstream education, and she did, passing her 11 Plus and going to grammar school. She had extra support \u2014 a classroom assistant was assigned to help her copy notes off the board \u2014 and kept up academically.\n\nAlexandra\u2019s speech is fluent, most unusual in someone deaf since birth. She credits her mum, who would \u2018hold balloons between us and say every word so I would feel the vibrations\u2019. Stock picture\n\nBut making friends was harder. \u2018At grammar school, I didn\u2019t really have any friends,\u2019 she says. \u2018It was quite isolating. I was the deaf/blind kid no one wanted to talk to.\u2019 Aged 16, and by then thriving in the Paralympic sports world (she was part of the Team GB swimming team aiming for London 2012), she suffered serious gastrointestinal problems that led to 20 major operations.\n\nSome of those issues linger. She\u2019s been admitted to intensive care 15 times in the past two years. \u2018I was born with only one kidney, have always had asthma and have various respiratory problems, and they are investigating whether there is an underlying genetic condition.\u2019\n\nIn 2000, she spent 18 months in hospital, devastating for someone so active \u2014 but illuminating. It was there that she decided she wanted to be a doctor.\n\n\u2018Every day, several junior doctors stood around my bed and looked at my notes. Mostly, they didn\u2019t look at me.\n\n\u2018One day, one came back and asked me if I was OK. I said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I am,\u201d and I burst into tears.\n\n\u2018The doctor pulled the curtains round and showed me a scar from when she\u2019d had surgery at my age. She knew how terrifying it was.\u2019\n\nBy the time she was discharged, her contemporaries had finished school, so Alexandra reluctantly enrolled in a specialist blind school. It was the making of her.\n\n\u2018On one hand, I thrived there. It was residential, so they taught us about independence: we had to do our own washing; I went to the shops on my own for the first time. But academically? There was no expectation any of us would make anything of our lives in that way. I still feel sad about that.\u2019\n\nIt sounds as if her parents and teachers at the blind school were half-supportive, half-horrified that she wanted to apply to medical school. Perhaps their reticence was well-founded.\n\nAlexandra says she applied to one of the country\u2019s leading medical schools (she declines to name and shame) and was accepted on the condition she got the required A-levels. She did, achieving three As.\n\nShe recalls: \u2018They were fully aware of my disabilities and I kept saying: \u201cAre you sure this won\u2019t be a problem?\u201d\n\n\u2018At the 11th hour, they said sorry, they couldn\u2019t have me after all, my disabilities were too great. I was devastated. To have come that far and have it whipped away . . .\u2019\n\nWithout much hope, she then applied to Cardiff University\u2019s medical school \u2014 and was thrilled to be accepted.\n\nThat was four years ago. The fact that Alexandra is still on track is astonishing, given the high drop-out rate in medical schools.\n\nThere is no blueprint for how to teach a deaf/blind person to be a doctor. She has learned to do sutures, take blood, catheterise, by \u2018seeing what I can do, and when I can\u2019t, seeing if it can be adapted\u2019.\n\nShe cannot manage invisible stitches, but can handle coloured ones (\u2018the navy blue ones are the best\u2019). Finding veins to take blood is surprisingly easy: \u2018My sense of touch is heightened, so much so that other medical students come and ask me to help, especially on the geriatric wards where patients\u2019 veins just can\u2019t be seen.\u2019\n\nAnd X-rays? Isn\u2019t the ability to read them a basic? \u2018It is. It\u2019s one of those things that even if you want to be a psychiatrist, you won\u2019t get through medical school unless you can read an X-ray. I can.\u2019\n\nShe is a campaigner on disabled issues and has started a support group called Faces Of The NHS, which stresses inclusivity.\n\nShe\u2019s also passionate about teamwork in the health service.\n\n\u2018Doctors are never alone. Every patient is treated by a team. So, if I\u2019m in a situation on duty where I think I can make a clinical diagnosis, but I want to double-check that there isn\u2019t a rash, I will ask a colleague. And I know why people will want to focus on what I can\u2019t do, but what about the things I can do? If anything, my clinical knowledge has to be greater.\u2019\n\nShe says what will make her a good doctor \u2014 perhaps a better one than those who can see and hear perfectly \u2014 is that she doesn\u2019t simply rely on basic faculties.\n\n\u2018Some doctors rely just on what they see and hear. That\u2019s when mistakes happen. You can have perfect hearing, but not actually hear.\u2019 She has other senses: \u2018I have empathy. What I\u2019ve been through has given me that. I\u2019ve been standing round the bed myself, with a group of medical students, and I was the only one to see the patient was upset. How ironic is that?\n\n\u2018The deaf/blind student was the only one to notice. I always say I might not have sight, but I have more insight than many.\u2019\n\nThere is some way to go before Alexandra will be fully qualified. She is doing her current year part-time because of her health issues and admits she has \u2018the sense that some people are just waiting for me to fail\u2019.\n\nThat door handle jibe and others like it seem to have caused her resolve to wobble. \u2018It knocked my confidence and there have been times when I\u2019ve not wanted to use my cane, or not wanted to use my phone up close, because I don\u2019t want them judging me. That\u2019s sad, though, because when that happens, I feel I\u2019ve lost my identity, and it\u2019s these things that will actually help me to do the job.\u2019\n\nWhen Alexandra completes her training, she wants to specialise in palliative care. For her, bedside manner is the part that appeals.\n\nAnd that cane? It\u2019s quite the conversation-starter. \u2018Patients love it,\u2019 she laughs. \u2018They ask me if I am a drummer, or, if they have one themselves, we compare them.\n\n\u2018It gives us a bond and lets them see their doctor is human, which, in my book, is a good thing.\n\n\u2018Doctors aren\u2019t superheroes, you know, and I don\u2019t think they should try to be.\u2019", "description": "Alexandra Adams, 25, from Cardiff, is a fourth-year medical student, on track to become the first doctor in Britain who is registered both deaf and blind.", "authors": ["Jenny Johnston For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/21/19708704-0-image-a-2_1571083693391.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
