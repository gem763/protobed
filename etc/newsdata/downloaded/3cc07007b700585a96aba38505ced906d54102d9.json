We got O\u2019Brien onto Europol and Interpol\u2019s most wanted lists, a first as previously dual circulation was not permitted.\n\n\u201cWe had nearly a hundred potential sightings and we followed up every one - from Lidl in London to Luxemburg.\n\n\"At one point we believed he was in Dubai and did a lot of work with authorities there to try to track him.\n\n\"He also had links to Spain, France and Ireland.\n\n\u201cIn February 2017 he messed up \u2013 getting arrested and bailed in Prague for a minor scuffle in a club. It meant we were able to obtain up-to-date images of him, which revealed he\u2019d had a distinctive tattoo on his back of his children\u2019s name covered up by an owl holding a skull, had a full beard and had grown his hair.\n\n\"He was also using Italian aliases.\n\n\u201cThe work that went into trying to track him around the world was exceptional and I have nothing but thanks and praise for colleagues in the Met, the NCA and all those involved, including media here and abroad who carried so many of our appeals.\u201d", "description": "Shane O'Brien slashed Josh Hanson's neck on a night out in West London before going on the run", "authors": ["Dave Burke", "Milo Boyd", "Image", "Pa", "Met Police", "Getwestlondon", "Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20076353.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Josh-Hanson-death.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
