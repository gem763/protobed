Can\u2019t justify a cold weather haul quite yet? Students, hit up UNiDAYs for a 20% discount (it\u2019s normally 10%). The promotional code applies to everything full price on the site, so those cute checked coats and cozy cashmere knits just got a whole lot cheaper. To get this discount, all you need to do is fill out the H&M validation form via UNiDAYs (sign up and see the full terms here). But, since the offer is valid for a limited time only, we suggest you get on it asap. Need some help deciding what to buy? We\u2019ve rounded up our top 20 faves on the site right now.\n\nWe earn a commission for products purchased through some of the links in this article.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uHhEbCB9TFm9QI3fVVtJWg--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmo_633/e0ed6467c141d790d8e41cda15d29c82", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
