And beyond that, she said, the help created \u201can immeasurable, psychological impact \u2014 that the U.S. has our back.\"\n\nNow Trump\u2019s aborted aid cutoff \u2014 first reported by POLITICO in late August \u2014 has mushroomed into a titanic political fight, centered on allegations that the president was using the military assistance as leverage to push Ukraine\u2019s government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. House oversight committees are demanding more data from the White House Office of Management and Budget on when and how the decision to sever the aid arose, including requesting that some documentation be delivered to Capitol Hill by Tuesday.\n\nThe military aid program shifted American support over the past five years much more heavily toward security after economic development, loan guarantees and anti-corruption programs defined much of the support following Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe U.S. bumped up its military support in 2014, soon after a popular uprising ousted President Viktor Yanukovych, an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Russian troops annexed the Crimean peninsula while fomenting a separatist uprising in eastern Ukraine's Donbass region.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nThe vast majority of the funds, approved with bipartisan support in Congress, has financed items such as sniper rifles; rocket-propelled grenade launchers; counter-artillery radars; command and control and communications systems; night vision goggles; medical equipment; as well training and logistical support. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is especially interested in buying more Javelin anti-tank missiles to combat the Russian tanks and other armored vehicles \u2014 a topic he broached during his July 25 telephone call with Trump that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry .\n\n\"Mr. Trump brought up American aid to that country \u2014 without explicitly mentioning that he had just frozen a military aid package of hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 and then pressed the Ukrainian leader to investigate Mr. Biden,\" says the unclassified copy of the whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration released last week. \"White House officials believed they had witnessed Trump abuse his power for personal political gain.\"\n\nThe call came a week after Trump ordered his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, to instruct OMB to halt the remainder of $390 million in military aid appropriated by Congress this year in the Pentagon and State Department budgets. The administration released the aid earlier this month after demands from Congress.\n\nEven before the current furor, questions of how much or how little to help Ukraine's military counter Russian aggression have embroiled Washington for years.\n\nNowhere was it more pointed than the Ukrainians\u2019 request, as far back as 2014, to purchase the advanced Javelin anti-tank missiles.\n\nThe Javelin issue \u201cbecame fetishized and it became a litmus test: \u2018Will you stand up to Putin or will you kowtow to him?\u2019\u201d said Samuel Charap, a former senior adviser at the State Department specializing in Russia and Eurasia. \u201cIt was like a Rorschach test.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with the merits of the Javelin or the question of what would actually be most effective and important for helping Ukraine,\" added Charap, who is now a senior political scientist at the government-funded Rand Corp.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/a6/b0/0b72d32e43148a67e77a39ab08ef/trump.png\"\n\nThe Obama administration agonized over the issue but never approved the sale out of fear of escalating the conflict \u2014 despite entreaties from Carter, who served in several top Pentagon positions at the time.\n\nThe aim was to \u201cdo everything we could within the boundaries of what was wise without baiting the Russians into doing something worse,\u201d recalled Chuck Hagel, the former Republican senator who was Obama's secretary of defense from 2013 to 2015.\n\nThe Javelins also helped spur a controversy over the Republican Party's platform in 2016, after Trump\u2019s campaign succeeded in watering down anti-Russia language and ensuring it would not call for \u201cproviding lethal defensive weapons\u201d to Ukraine.\n\nYet once Trump was in office , the Ukrainian government and its allies in Congress kept pushing the request.\n\nFinally, in 2018, long after the Russian tanks pulled back from the front, the State Department finally approved a foreign military sale of 210 Javelin missiles, along with launchers and training, for $47 million.\n\nCharap said the missiles\u2019 military value was limited \u2014 they \u201cended up on the other side of the country from where the conflict is and under lock and key.\u201d But they held significant value in eastern Ukraine, where retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. John Gronski credits the missiles with helping to stabilize the military crisis by \u201cdeterring the separatists from bringing armor into the region.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainians \"really appreciate the Javelins,\u201d said Gronski, who served as the deputy commanding general of U.S. Army Europe until June of this year.\n\nMichael Kofman, a senior research scientist at CNA, a government-funded think tank, also called the Javelins an \"insurance policy\" against Russian escalation.\n\nBut in Carter's view, \"its political significance was greater than its military significance.\"\n\nThe less controversial military aid, meanwhile, has come to represent a lifeline for the Ukrainian military, which has achieved key milestones in recent months. While it was never intended to change the balance of power, the assistance has had measurable effect in deterring more aggression, say those who have been directly involved.\n\nIndeed, Trump's recent assertion that the aid initiated under Obama merely provided \"sheets and pillows\" is directly refuted by those who oversaw it.\n\nThat applies especially to the U.S.-financed military training, which takes place at the Yavoriv training center in western Ukraine near the border with Poland.\n\nInitially, American, Polish, Lithuanian and Canadian troops conducted the training of Ukrainian forces \u2014 first for smaller, company-sized units of several hundred soldiers and then up to the level of a brigade, which can include thousands of troops.\n\nBut now, battle-experienced Ukrainian troops are conducting most of the training, Gronski said, leaving the U.S. forces \u201cin more of an observer role.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. instruction in combat medicine has had a direct impact on the battlefield in the east, Gronski said. \u201cSeveral times, across several visits, Ukrainian battalion commanders told me that those kits and that training absolutely saved lives.\"", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5b/6c/d291459849838bed762c8d2b853e/20190930-zelensky-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
