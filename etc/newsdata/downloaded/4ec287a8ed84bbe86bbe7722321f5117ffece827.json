It's been this great moment of players in the NBA standing their ground and knowing their worth. It's been an era of players no longer accepting the status quo. But one thing that I think has gotten lost in the shuffle of all that, or at least not stressed enough, is the idea that true player empowerment means fighting for the empowerment of all players \u2014 not just NBA players. Not just male players. Otherwise, what are we actually accomplishing?\u201d\n\nBeal, who is entering his eighth season with the Wizards, wrote that all WNBA players are asking for is a piece of the WNBA\u2019s \u201cpie.\u201d\n\nLYNX BOSS CHERYL REEVE CHOSEN WNBA EXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR\n\n\u201cYou see people out there acting like these women are being greedy, or trying to make $30 million a year. But that's not the case,\u201d Beal insisted. \u201cAll they're doing is asking for a more equal piece of their league's pie. A term we use when we talk about the pie in our NBA negotiations is \u2018BRI,\u2019 or Basketball Related Income - and I think that's a helpful way of explaining what these women are after.\n\n\u201cIn the NBA, we as players get 50% of our league's total BRI. In the WNBA? I think they get less than 25% of theirs. How is it being greedy to ask for more equality?\u201d\n\nAccording to data from High Post Hoops, the highest paid WNBA player this season was the Seattle Storm\u2019s Jewell Loyd, who made $119,500.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nAbout 49 other players were making more than $100,000 this season. The second-highest salary in the league was shared by a handful of players at 117,500.", "description": "Washington Wizards guard Bradley Beal on Sunday advocated for WNBA players to get fair pay ahead of Game 3 of the WNBA Finals between the Washington Mystics and Connecticut Sun.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
