REUTERS/Gleb Garanich\n\nAround 20,000 people, including war veterans, took part in the rally \u2018No capitulation\u2019 against what they say are unacceptable concessions by Zelenskiy over the Donbass region.\n\nUkrainian, Russian and separatist negotiators agreed last month that Kiev would grant the territory controlled by the separatists a special status and hold elections there.\n\nUkraine also agreed to call back its forces from the current contact line with separatist fighters.\n\nThe peace plan was previously rejected by the government. Zelenskiy has said he would \u201cnever betray Ukraine\u201d and \u201cany red line will not be crossed\u201d.\n\nBut many Ukrainians say these measures are a betrayal by Zelenskiy who took power in April after a landslide election win. The war in eastern Ukraine has killed more than 13,000 people since April 2014.\n\n\u201cWe are for peace, but we want it to be done differently. We also want our boys not to die, but we want our land to remain our land and that there are no enemies on our land,\u201d protester Ludmyla Linnyk said.\n\n\u201cWe have little information about this and it suggests that something is being prepared that we don\u2019t like,\u201d said Pavlo Musiyenko, who was at the rally with his wife and child.\n\nThe deal also opened the way for a resumption of top-level peace talks to end the conflict, which helped send Russia\u2019s ties with the West to post-Cold War lows in 2014.\n\nEarlier this month Zelenskiy said he would discuss a peace deal for Donbass in four-way talks with Russia, Germany and France.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko told Reuters on Monday the leaders could meet in Paris in mid-November if Kiev and pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine can maintain a ceasefire..", "description": "Thousands of people marched through central Kiev on Monday to protest against President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's deal with Moscow to grant special status to a pro-Russian rebel-held region of eastern Ukraine as part of efforts to end a five-year conflict there.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440800915&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D1GR", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
