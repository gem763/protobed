The proceeds of the sale will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, production and development and potential acquisitions.\n\nNetflix is issuing debt after reporting earnings that beat analyst estimates and saw overseas growth that helped sooth investors\u2019 concerns about a slowdown at home. The company burned through $551 million of cash in the third quarter and is \u201cslowly\u201d moving toward becoming free cash flow positive, Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings said in a letter to shareholders last week. In the meantime, Netflix will continue to tap the high-yield market for its investment needs, he said.\n\nThe Los Gatos, California-based company reiterated expectations to burn through $3.5 billion in cash this year as the war for content heats up. It\u2019s been raising prices -- often at the expense of subscriber gains -- in some of its largest territories, trying to shift toward profitability as streaming service competition mounts from companies such as Walt Disney Co., AT&T Inc. and Apple Inc.\n\nNetflix has historically relied on the high-yield bond market to finance its growth, typically issuing debt following its first- and third-quarter earnings in April and October, respectively. Its debt load, including operating lease liabilities, has steadily grown to around $13.5 billion since first tapping the market in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company last borrowed $2.24 billion of junk bonds in April, and said that it would reduce its reliance on debt financing at the time. CEO Hastings walked back that language in a July letter to shareholders, saying Netflix planned to still use the high-yield market to fund content investments.\n\nNetflix\u2019s shares and bonds were little changed in early trading in New York. The stock opened at around $276 Monday.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the bond sale, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The notes are expected to price Tuesday, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are private.\n\n(Updates with trading data in the penultimate paragraph)\n\n--With assistance from Rizal Tupaz.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Molly Smith in New York at msmith604@bloomberg.net;Elizabeth Rembert in New York at erembert@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Nikolaj Gammeltoft at ngammeltoft@bloomberg.net, Allan Lopez, Christopher DeReza\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. is selling bonds as it continues to bolster its original content in the face of expanding competition.The company is offering around $2 billion of bonds between dollars and euros, according to a statement Monday.
