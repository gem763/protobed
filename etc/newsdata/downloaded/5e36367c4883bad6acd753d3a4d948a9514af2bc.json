Still only a teenager, she stands 5ft 2in tall, weighs a fraction over eight stone, and speaks in the fast, whispery tones of someone who would rather not be speaking at all.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nRather than giving an interview, Kinsella would probably prefer to be back in her bedroom, watching one of her beloved make-up tutorials on YouTube. Yet this shrinking violet has an unexpectedly steely side. In April, at the European Championships in Poland, she became the first Briton to take balance-beam gold at a major event. Next weekend, in Stuttgart, she will try to repeat this triumph at the Worlds.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk to the little ones at my club, they always say \u2018Oh, beam is really scary,\u2019\u201d Kinsella told the Sunday Telegraph last week, during a break from training at Lilleshall. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like \u2018I actually loved it when I was little.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been my favourite piece and my strongest one too,\u201d Kinsella added. \u201cI like the fact that anything can happen on the day. You need to be elegant, you need to have power, and you need to be accurate \u2013 no wonky moves. Because once you\u2019re off, you\u2019re off completely.\u201d\n\nHer routine centres on a three-part combination \u2013 a cartwheel followed by two backflips, all performed without putting her arms down \u2013 which has to be performed on a four-inch wide strip of leather or suede. If she doesn\u2019t stay perfectly square, the inaccuracies compound themselves and she tumbles to the floor.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast training session today before I head off to Germany for the World Championships tomorrow morning\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. It was tough mentally and physically but I had such a great session. I\u2019m now ready to go out there and smash it with the girls\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd#letsdothis \u2014 Alice Kinsella (@AliceKinsella16) September 27, 2019\n\nThe beam is a uniquely stressful experience for everyone. During the London Olympics, Ricky and Lynn Raisman \u2013 whose daughter Aly finished with bronze \u2013 became social-media sensations when the cameras caught them living every step by squirming from side to side in their seats.\n\nHere is a ruthless examination of physical precision and mental courage \u2013 but one which Kinsella relishes. Her feats over the past two seasons have set an inspirational example to her team-mates and helped change the international perception that Brits always fall off the beam. Which, in turn, recalls the transformational moment in the early 2000s when Louis Smith became the first British gymnast to master the dreaded pommel horse.\n\nDoes Kinsella believe she can match the trailblazing feats of Smith, who would go on to win 16 major championship medals including two European golds? \u201cI hope so,\u201d she replied. \u201cAt the Europeans, us GB lot were really good on beam. We had no falls at the championships which was amazing. I think we have improved a lot and it will actually be one of our best pieces in the future.\u201d\n\nKinsella may draw her resilience from her sporting ancestry. Her father Mark was a midfield general for Charlton Athletic, and also won 48 caps for the Republic of Ireland. Her brother Liam \u2013 who is 23 \u2013 now plays for Walsall in League Two, mainly as a right-back, where he is known for a ferocious work-rate.\n\n\u201cMy dad lives in Ireland now, because he manages a football team there [Drogheda United],\u201d said Kinsella. \u201cI think it makes him proud to see Liam follow in his footsteps and me doing gymnastics. I do try to go and watch Liam play, but it\u2019s difficult to fit around my training. I always tell him that in football, all they do is kick a ball around. Whereas with gymnastics you\u2019ve got loads of disciplines, and you\u2019re using your whole body. It\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s risk-taking, it\u2019s definitely a lot tougher.\n\n\u201cWe live with my mum near Walsall, and I have also a sister who is a beautician. She does nails and fake tan and wax and things like that. I\u2019d like to be a make-up artist one day, I\u2019m teaching myself to do it using YouTube videos because it\u2019s a good thing to practise when you\u2019re at home chilling. But I will also probably do a bit of coaching when I retire.\u201d\n\nRetirement is never far away in a sport where the average career finishes in the early- to mid-20s, but Kinsella \u2013 who will turn 19 in March \u2013 still has much to prove. While the beam may be her strongest apparatus, she has improved so much on the other three pieces \u2013 stepping clear of an emerging group that includes Georgia-Mae Fenton, Kelly Simm and Amelie Morgan \u2013 that she can now challenge Ellie Downie for the title of Britain\u2019s top all-round performer.\n\n\u201cUntil a couple of years ago, I\u2019d be so nervous at the big events that I\u2019d be shaking,\u201d said Kinsella. \u201cBut since the Europeans [where she also qualified third in the all-around] I\u2019ve never felt so confident. Now I just want to go out there and smash my routines.\u201d", "description": "Alice Kinsella is the most understated of heroes.
