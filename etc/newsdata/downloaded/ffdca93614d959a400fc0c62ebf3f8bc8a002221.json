Security Council members for it to give up its nuclear weapons and denounced a recent U.S. missile test.\n\nFILE PHOTO - A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Picture\n\nFive European members of the U.N. Security Council met on Tuesday to urge North Korea to take \u201cconcrete steps\u201d towards giving up its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.\n\nThat call came days after North Korea said it had test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, the latest in a series of missile tests since it resumed dialogue with the United States in 2018, and the break-off over the weekend of a round of talks in Sweden.\n\nDespite the recent tests, Pyongyang has stuck to a freeze in testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles that has been in place since 2017 and allowed for three meetings between its leader, Kim Jong Un, and U.S. President Donald Trump since last year.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s foreign ministry raised questions about that restraint in a statement carried by the country\u2019s official KCNA news agency. It referred to a U.S. test this month of a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, which it called an effort to exert pressure on North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe DPRK can give tit for tat, but exercises restraint under the judgment that it does not need to take a counteraction and it is premature,\u201d it said, using the acronym for the country\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.\n\n\u201cBut there is a limit to the patience of the DPRK and there is no guarantee that all our patience would continue indefinitely,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement said there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d for the U.N. Security Council to take up an issue related to North Korea\u2019s self-defence and said the European countries had \u201cacted at the instigation of the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality urges the DPRK to reconsider crucial preemptive measures taken by it for the building confidence in the U.S.,\u201d it added.\n\nThe statement did not elaborate, but North Korean officials have previously referred to the freezing of nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests, and the return of remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-1953 Korean War, as good-faith gestures to the United States that have not been reciprocated.\n\nThe statement followed a fresh round of nuclear talks between North Korea and the United States in Sweden which broke off on Saturday with Pyongyang blaming Washington for inflexibility.\n\nWhile the United States says it brought \u201ccreative ideas\u201d and \u201cnew initiatives\u201d to the talks, the foreign ministry statement said Washington came with \u201can empty hand\u201d and then \u201cencouraged its satellites to release a statement critical of the DPRK.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now looking deep into what its intention was.\u201d\n\nAsked about the latest statement, a U.S. State Department spokesman repeated a call for the North Koreans \u201cto refrain from provocations, abide by their obligations under U.N. Security Council Resolutions, and remain engaged in substantive and sustained negotiations.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. State Department said at the weekend that it had accepted Sweden\u2019s invitation to return for more discussions with North Korea in two weeks.\n\nNorth Korea has not made clear whether it will attend and has reiterated a year-end deadline that Kim Jong Un set in April for the United States to show more flexibility in talks.\n\nIn April, Kim suggested that the deadlock in talks had made him question the testing moratorium that Trump has repeatedly held up as evidence of progress in their dialogue.", "description": "North Korea issued a veiled warning on Thursday that it could eventually end a freeze in long-range missile testing as it criticised a call by U.N.
