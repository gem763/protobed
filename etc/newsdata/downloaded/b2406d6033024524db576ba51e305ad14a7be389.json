But when it comes to our clothes, the impacts are less obvious.\n\nAs consumers worldwide buy more clothes, the growing market for cheap items and new styles is taking a toll on the environment.

Fashion production makes up 10% of humanity's carbon emissions, dries up water sources, and pollutes rivers and streams.\n\nWhat's more, 85% of all textiles go to the dump each year. And washing some types of clothes sends thousands of bits of plastic into the ocean.\n\nHere are the most significant impacts fast fashion has on the planet.", "description": "The fashion industry is the second-largest consumer of water and the second-largest polluter of water.
