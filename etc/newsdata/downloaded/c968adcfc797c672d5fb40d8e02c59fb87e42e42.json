So we need a different answer, and that different answer can only be to stop the migrants of course ideally at the EU\u2019s exterior borders but if that doesn\u2019t work than at national borders.\u201d\n\nOver the last few weeks, fearful of becoming a bottleneck, various EU countries have denied entry to migrants after Germany began returning some without valid papers back over its border.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel who has been criticised by her own party for her open door refugee policy has again defended herself.\n\nTo deal with the influx she too wants EU external borders to be made more secure. It was an issue during talks with Greece\u2019s president , Greece being one of the main gateways to Europe for migrants crossing the Aegean. Merkel is also seeking a deal to resettle asylum seekers across the European Union, thus avoiding a breakdown of free travel and commerce within the bloc.", "description": "Freezing temperatures and still they come\u2026.Around 850 refugees battled snowfalls on Monday as they trudged through Serbia heading towards northern", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/321636/1000x563_321636.jpg", "published_at": "2016-01-18"}
