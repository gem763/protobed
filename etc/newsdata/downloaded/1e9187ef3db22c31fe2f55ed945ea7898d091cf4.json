House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg told Parliament that a vote would be held Monday on a new motion calling for an election in October.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain whether it will pass, with opposition parties divided over whether to agree to an election now.\n\nJohnson said he would \u201crather be dead in a ditch\u201d than delay Brexit any further, and insisted that whether or not Britain left the EU as planned on Oct. 31 must be \u201ca matter for the people of this country to decide.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

He said he would also step down from Parliament, the latest in a series of resignations by Conservative moderates opposed to the government\u2019s hard-line Brexit stance.\n\nBoris Johnson became prime minister in July after promising Conservatives that he would complete Brexit and break the impasse that has paralyzed Britain\u2019s politics since voters decided in June 2016 to leave the bloc and which brought down his predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nAfter only six weeks in office, however, his plans to lead the U.K. out of the EU are in crisis. He is caught between the EU, which refuses to renegotiate the deal it struck with May, and a majority of British lawmakers opposed to leaving without an agreement. Most economists say a no-deal Brexit would cause severe economic disruption and plunge the U.K. into recession.\n\nJohnson\u2019s solution is to seek an election that could shake up Parliament and produce a less troublesome crop of lawmakers. It\u2019s a risky gambit: Opinion polls don\u2019t point to a clear majority for the Conservatives and the public mood is volatile.\n\nBritish prime ministers used to be able to call elections at will, but under 2011 legislation fixing elections at five-year intervals, they now need the support of two-thirds of lawmakers in Parliament to hold an early poll.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson asked Parliament to back an Oct. 15 election \u2014 but Parliament said no, with opposition parties either voting against him or abstaining.\n\nCorbyn said Labour, the biggest opposition party, would only vote for an early election if the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was taken off the table.\n\nLabour economy spokesman John McDonnell said the party wanted an election but was still deciding on whether to seek one before the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline, or to wait until Parliament had secured a delay to Britain\u2019s departure from the bloc.\n\n\u201cThe problem that we have got is that we cannot at the moment have any confidence in Boris Johnson abiding by any commitment or deal that we could construct,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth of it. So, we are now consulting about whether it\u2019s better to go long, therefore, rather than to go short.\u201d\n\nOpposition lawmakers, supported by Conservative Party rebels, are close to passing a bill that would block a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31, compelling the prime minister to seek a three-month delay to Britain\u2019s departure if no agreement is reached by late October.\n\nThe bill was approved by the House of Commons on Wednesday, but faced trouble in Parliament\u2019s upper chamber, the House of Lords, where pro-Brexit members planned to defeat it by filibustering \u2014 talking until time ran out.\n\nBut early Thursday, the Lords agreed to let the bill pass through the chamber by Friday, allowing it to become law on Monday.\n\nJohnson said the legislation would \u201cscupper our negotiating power and make it much more difficult for the government to get a deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson plans to suspend Parliament at some point next week until Oct. 14, a decision that enraged opponents of Brexit and faces several legal challenges. His critics accused him of subverting democracy and carrying out a \u201ccoup.\u201d\n\nTransparency campaigner Gina Miller, who won a 2017 Supreme Court ruling that stopped the government from triggering the countdown to Brexit without a vote in Parliament, took the government to the High Court on Thursday over the suspension.\n\nMiller, who is supported in her claim by Labour and the governments of Scotland and Wales, argues that sending lawmakers home at a crucial time is unlawful.\n\n\u201cWe say that what the prime minister is not entitled to do is to close Parliament for five weeks at such a critical time without justification,\u201d her lawyer, David Pannick, told the hearing.\n\nThe case continues Friday, when judges may give their ruling.\n\nJohnson insists he wants to secure a revised divorce deal to replace the agreement May struck with the bloc, which was rejected three times by British lawmakers. He told Parliament this week there was \u201creal momentum\u201d in negotiations with the EU, but European officials deny this and say Britain has yet to produce any concrete proposals.\n\nPro-Brexit British politicians want a looser economic relationship with the EU than foreseen under May\u2019s deal, to make it easier to strike new trade pacts with other countries, notably the United States.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence met Johnson in London on Thursday and later tweeted: \u201cAs the deadline for Brexit approaches, we urge the European Union to negotiate in good faith with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson and work to reach an agreement that respects the United Kingdom\u2019s sovereignty and minimizes disruption to commerce.\u201d\n\nThat comment is likely to please the British government but annoy EU officials and pro-EU Britons.\n\nAt the meeting, Pence said Washington \u201cis ready, willing and able to immediately negotiate a free trade agreement with the U.K.\u201d\n\nBut anti-Brexit U.K. politicians fear the Trump administration will demand access to Britain\u2019s state-funded National Health Service as part of any deal.\n\nJohnson told Pence \u201cwe will do everything to increase free trade, but the National Health Service is not on the table as far as our negotiations go.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re not too keen on that chlorinated chicken either,\u201d he said \u2014 a reference to concerns that Britain will have to lower animal hygiene standards as part of a trade deal.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would 'rather be dead in a ditch' than delay Brexit any further.", "authors": ["Jill Lawless"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/boris-johnson-brexit-ditch-comments.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
