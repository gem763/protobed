Advocates insist that ending the policy will put vulnerable immigrants at risk. | Mario Tama/Getty Images Immigration Trump official urges end to medical exemption for deportations\n\nAn internal memo prepared by a top Trump immigration official recommends that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services be stripped of its authority to delay deportations for undocumented immigrants receiving treatment for serious medical conditions.\n\nThe Trump administration in August quietly halted its processing of such requests, which are known as \"deferred action.\" Democrats and activists argued that the move put vulnerable people at risk of deportation and possibly even death.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe memo, obtained by POLITICO, clarifies that the agency would prefer to see its authority removed altogether to grant relief from deportation in such cases.\n\nIn the memo, USCIS Policy and Strategy Chief Kathy Nuebel Kovarik lays out six options for acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to take. These range from removing the agency\u2019s deferred action authority to reverting to the earlier status quo.\n\nNuebel Kovarik writes that USCIS would prefer that McAleenan revoke the agency\u2019s authority to grant deferred action unless required to do so by statute \u2014 a change that would eliminate any possibility of its honoring such humanitarian requests in the future. If McAleenan doesn\u2019t take that route, she says, the agency recommends that he maintain the current freeze on processing deferred action requests.\n\n\u201cUSCIS strongly believes that the exercise of deferred action is subject to abuse,\u201d Nuebel Kovarik writes, \u201cand if we continue to accept such requests, even with narrow medical criteria, we will be creating a de facto \u2018program\u2019 of criteria ... which are not enumerated in statute or regulations.\u201d\n\nNuebel Kovarik adds that any expansion of the authority \u201cruns counter to the president's agenda to enforce our existing laws and potentially contrary to his goal of making sure aliens are self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nUSCIS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nActing U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Ken Cuccinelli | Steve Helber/AP File Photo\n\nMark Krikorian, executive director of the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies, pointed to the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is unrelated to medical deferred action, as an example of potential misuse. Former President Barack Obama launched DACA in 2012 in order to allow undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to live and work legally.\n\n\u201cDACA is deferred action, so obviously it has been abused,\u201d Krikorian said. \u201cAmnestying hundreds of thousands of people is something that Congress needs to do, not bureaucrats. This isn\u2019t an issue of postponing someone\u2019s deportation.\u201d\n\nThe recent USCIS decision did not affect DACA, which Trump began to phase out in September 2017. Several federal judges blocked the termination, and the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on the matter in mid-November.\n\nThe memo, part of briefing materials for a Sept. 9 meeting to be led by acting USCIS Director Ken Cuccinelli, offers a window into the Trump administration's internal decisionmaking over how to handle deportation relief going forward.\n\nCuccinelli, speaking to reporters after an Axios event Thursday, said he couldn\u2019t comment on the deferred action moves because of ongoing litigation. A Boston-based immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit last week that seeks to block the change.\n\n\u201cUntil we sort out our response to the litigation, we\u2019re going to be very limited in what we have to say about it,\u201d he said.\n\nUSCIS' authority to grant deportation relief through deferred action dates back to the creation of the Homeland Security Department in 2003.\n\nThe agency estimates that roughly 1,000 people request deferred action annually, with fewer than half granted relief. Advocates insist that ending the policy will put vulnerable immigrants at risk.\n\n\u201cI think the effects would be devastating \u2014 morally, legally and to the individuals affected,\u201d said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, director of an immigrant rights clinic at Penn State Law.\n\nSivaprasad Wadhia, who testified before a House Oversight subcommittee on the matter Wednesday, stressed that people approved for deferred action sometimes come to the U.S. to participate in clinical trials not available in their home countries, or receive other critical treatment.\n\n\u201cYou are adding to an already overwhelmed immigration court system by placing the most vulnerable people into removal proceedings,\u201d she added.\n\nBeginning Aug. 7, USCIS sent letters to approximately 400 deferred action applicants that said the agency would no longer process their deferred action requests. The letters instructed the applicants to depart the country within 33 days.\n\nThe agency did not publicize the move, which came to light following advocacy efforts and subsequent news reports. In response to media requests, USCIS said deferred action requests should be directed to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, although that guidance was not provided in several letters to deferred action applicants.\n\nThe internal memo suggests that ICE would provide dramatically fewer opportunities for immigrants to obtain relief.\n\n\u201cICE does not accept any requests for deferred action nor does it accept affirmative requests for prosecutorial discretion for aliens in removal proceedings,\u201d the document reads. \u201cMoreover, ICE has no processes or procedures to consider prosecutorial discretion requests for aliens who have yet to come to ICE\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nMorning Shift newsletter Get the latest on employment and immigration, every weekday morning \u2014 in your inbox.

However, he added, ICE allows immigrants to request deportation relief after their removal proceedings have concluded.\n\n\u201cICE will consider all relevant factors in deciding whether to issue a stay of removal, including any claimed medical basis for this request,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cHowever, such stays are considered solely on ICE's discretion on a case-by-case basis.\u201c\n\nThe decision to halt non-military deferred action requests infuriated Democrats and pro-migrant advocates. Amid the backlash, USCIS announced in early September that it would resume processing applications pending before Aug. 7.\n\nFormer acting ICE Director Thomas Homan, another witness at the hearing this week, accused Democrats of distorting the issue.\n\n\u201cYou want to conjure up a false narrative about sending dying children home,\u201d he said at the hearing, \u201cbut you won\u2019t address sanctuary policies that provide sanctuaries to criminals and put our communities at risk.\u201d", "description": "The Trump administration in August quietly halted its processing of such requests, which are known as \"deferred action.\"", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/2f/c2631e694024b55b5c1200358909/190913-border-wall-getty-773.jpg"}
