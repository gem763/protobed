In monetary policy statements and subsequent public remarks, the Fed \u2013 as well as other central banks including the Bank of England and Bank of Japan \u2013 continued to underscore the negative impacts to growth as a result of the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nBut even after largely delivering on market expectations for a September rate cut, the Fed is far from in the clear until its next policy-setting meeting in October.\n\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
