Neither the nationality of the victims, nor the origin of the container before it got to Zeebrugge, is currently known.\n\nThe truck was removed from the scene this afternoon, with the 39 victims still believed to be inside, as police begin the process of identifying them.\n\nMo Robinson is the truck driver arrested after 39 people were found dead in the back of a lorry he was driving\n\nPolice have found 39 dead bodies in the back of a lorry container on an Essex industrial estate. The lorry appears to have a refrigeration unit between the cab and the container leading experts to suggest those inside may have frozen to death\n\nRobinson arrived in the UK at the weekend. He picked up the trailer, which had been shipped from Zeebrugge to Purfleet, yesterday evening. Minutes later, he pulled into the Essex industrial estate and the alarm was raised\n\nThe lorry, which is believed to have the bodies still inside it, was removed from the scene under police escort this afternoon\n\nPolice officers bowed their heads as the truck passed. Detectives have begun the process of trying to identify 39 bodies found in a lorry on an industrial estate in Essex\n\nSpeaking this afternoon, Deputy Chief Constable Pippa Mills said: 'In order to ensure we maintain the dignity of the people who sadly lost their lives, we will be moving the lorry and the trailer shortly.'\n\nShe said they were being moved to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies can be recovered while preserving the dignity of the victims.\n\n'We are yet to identify them and must manage this sensitively with their families,' she added.\n\nThe lorry was later given a police escort as it snaked its way through the Thames Estuary docklands roads. Officers on the pavement bowed their heads in a mark of respect.\n\nTruck driver Robinson is still being questioned. He regularly posts about the Bulgarian-registered Scania truck cab on his Instagram and Facebook pages, referring to it as 'the Scandinavian Express' and 'the Polar Express'.\n\nA haulage boss in Northern Ireland told MailOnline: 'I've been told that Mo Robinson was the one who was driving the truck, but he doesn't own it. It's owned by a local lorry business.'\n\nFootage recorded by a business on the Waterglade Industrial Park, Thurrock shows the left-hand drive truck passing through the estate just half an hour before an ambulance crew discovered the bodies of 38 adults and a teenager in the back.\n\nThe lorry was reportedly registered in Bulgaria by an Irish company in 2017, then driven out of the eastern-European country to Northern Ireland. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said his country had no other connection with the deaths.\n\nThe Scania truck has the words 'Ireland' and 'The Ultimate Dream' on the windscreen. It was examined by forensics teams\n\nPhotos show the inside of the refrigerated trailer where 39 people were found dead in the early hours of this morning\n\nRobinson regularly posts photos of the Bulgarian-registered truck online. It is not however thought that he owns the vehicle\n\nAmong his many messages about the Scania lorry, Robinson refers to it as 'the Scandinavian express' and 'the polar express'. He often travels to Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands\n\nThe trailer is understood to be refrigerated, meaning temperatures inside could have been as low as -25C.\n\nDescribing the conditions inside, Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said, if the was refrigerated was switched on, conditions inside would have been 'absolutely horrendous' and would kill anyone inside 'pretty quickly'.\n\nMr Burnett added: 'It's going to be dark. If the fridge is running it's going to be incredibly cold.\n\n'The only place to go to the toilet is on board the back of the trailer. You can imagine if they've been in there for days then there will be faeces, there will be urine.'\n\nThe deaths will lead to renewed calls for added checks on vehicles entering Britain through so-called 'soft spot' ports, with Border Force resources currently focused on Dover.\n\nIn Parliament, Prime Minister Boris Johnson put aside the Brexit crisis, at least for a few minutes, and vowed that the people traffickers would be found and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\n\n'All such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice,' he said.\n\nAerial pictures show screens have been put around the back of the white lorry, with forensics tents placed nearby. Police have not said where those who died are from\n\nPolice in forensics suits were seen worked on the cab end of the lorry this morning. The origin of the container is unknown\n\nPolice believe the trailer was picked up from the port of Purfleet (pictured) minutes before the bodies were discovered\n\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, Thurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price said: 'To put 39 people into a locked metal container shows a contempt for human life that is evil. The best thing we can do in memory of those victims is to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice.'\n\nResponding, Boris Johnson said: 'It is hard to put ourselves in the shoes of those emergency services, as the right honourable gentleman opposite (Jeremy Corbyn) said, as they were asked to open that container and to expose the appalling crime that had taken place.\n\n'I must say I do share his strong desire now for the perpetrators of that crime, and indeed all those who engage in similar activity - because we know that this trade is going on - all such traders in human beings should be hunted down and brought to justice.'\n\nIrish premier Leo Varadkar said any necessary investigations would be undertaken if it was established the lorry had passed through Ireland.\n\n'The information that we have so far this morning is very sketchy but there are some reports that the truck may have passed through Ireland at some point,' he told the Dail parliament in Dublin.\n\nThe police have cordoned off the lorry while forensics experts gather evidence from the lorry\n\nLarge screens have been put up around the lorry while the murder investigation takes place\n\nIt is the biggest disaster of its kind since 2000, when 58 Chinese stowaways died on a ferry from Belgium to Britain.\n\nToday's tragedy has claimed more victims than the Manchester Arena bombing, in which 22 were killed.\n\nIn 2015, 71 migrants, including eight women and four children, were found dead in the back of a Slovakian meat lorry which was abandoned truck on an Austrian motorway.\n\nThe industrial estate where the lorry was found today is next to the Dartford Crossing and is used as a stopping point for lorries travelling south to the Port of Dover and the Channel Tunnel, although the planned route of the lorry involved is unknown.\n\nLithuanian lorry driver Tadas Cesnavicius works in the area. The 40-year-old said: 'You see a lot of lorries coming in and out the area, but whether they have people inside who knows? It is terrible to hear it happened right in the next road.'\n\nEmergency services sent five ambulances, their hazardous area response teams and a car from the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance to the scene.\n\nA restaurant worker in the industrial estate said the area was cordoned off by police this morning.\n\n'There's a lot of police and forensics,' the Big Blue Food Bus employee said. 'It's awful. We thought maybe someone had broken into a lorry, but it's just awful.'\n\nEssex Police said it set up a casualty bureau for people to call if they are concerned about relatives following the incident at the industrial park in Grays.\n\nPolice have not said where they believe the people had travelled from. They say it may take a long time to identify them all\n\nPolice and emergency services were called to the estate last night. They were unable to save any of those found in the container\n\nThe Prime Minister, the Home Secretary and the local MP have all stated their concern\n\nTragedy comes after trafficking gang jailing Today's tragedy comes less than a week after a Bulgarian trafficking gang were jailed for keeping women as sex slaves while they lived the high life. Iliya Mihaylov and Marian Ninov Vasilev Eleonora Vasileva, 34, Iliya Mihaylov, 31, and Marian Ninov Vasilev, also 34, trafficked women from their home country to squalid east London flats and forced them into a life of prostitution and Class A drug dealing. Their victims were greeted at the airport, forced to pay \u00a3200 and then moved to rented apartments. The group ran brothels across east London, and victims were rarely allowed to leave their squalid flats. The women were expected to work 24 hours a day, accepting any 'clients' immediately and unconditionally, to whom they were also forced to sell class A drugs. There is no suggestion the gang were involved in today's tragedy.\n\nThe investigation will now try to work out where the people came from and what route they had taken to get to the UK.\n\nAlp Mehmet, the chairman of the group Migration Watch UK, called on the government to better patrol Britain's borders to ensure such tragedies were not repeated.\n\nHe said: 'People-trafficking is a sickening business. It continues not only because the traffickers make huge amounts of money from it but are also often able to get away with it.\n\n'The risk is that more such tragedies will occur for so long as the UK fails to properly resource the border and return those who have no right to be here, which all but encourages traffickers to ply their trade by exploiting people who put their lives in their evil hands.'\n\nDespite the investigation being at an early stage and it being unclear where the victims died, the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants has already blamed the British government.\n\nThe charity's chief executive Satbir Singh said: 'Nobody should be in any doubt that the ultimate responsibility for these deaths lies with government policy which has deliberately closed down safe and legal routes into Britain.'\n\nBulgarian foreign ministry spokesman Tsvetana Krasteva said: 'We are in contact with our embassy in London and with British authorities.'\n\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) said: 'We are aware of this tragic incident which is now the subject of a murder investigation being led by Essex Police and we have deployed NCA officers to assist.\n\n'We are working with partners including Essex Police and Immigration Enforcement to provide specialist support to urgently identify and take action against any organised crime groups who might have played a role in causing these deaths.'\n\nThe Essex Police casualty bureau numbers are 0800 056 0944 for callers living in the UK, or 0207 158 0010 for people dialling from outside the UK, the force said.", "description": "Mo Robinson, 25, is believed to have driven from his home in a small village near Portadown, Northern Ireland , over the weekend and collected the trailer from the port of Purfleet late last night.", "authors": ["James Fielding", "Richard Spillett", "Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/15/20085322-0-image-a-2_1571841929209.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
