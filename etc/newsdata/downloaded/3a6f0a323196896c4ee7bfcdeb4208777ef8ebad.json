It\u2019s almost as deceptive as you showing all of the bombings taking place in Syria, and it turns out that the bombing you showed on television took place in Kentucky,\" Trump said.\n\n\"So, you know. I\u2019m not even sure that ABC apologized for that. But certainly it was a terrible thing. I\u2019m looking at this, I say, 'Wow, that\u2019s pretty bad.' And it was in Kentucky and not Syria. So I don\u2019t think we will do about that, but I think ABC owes an apology,\" he continued.\n\nUsers on social media were the ones who called out the network for showing footage that was taken in 2017. ABC News sent a correction tweet after the segment aired on Sunday and aired again Monday morning, saying they have taken down the video and they regretted the error.\n\nCORRECTION: We\u2019ve taken down video that aired on \u201cWorld News Tonight\" Sunday and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d this morning that appeared to be from the Syrian border immediately after questions were raised about its accuracy. ABC News regrets the error. \u2014 World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) October 14, 2019\n\nTrump then took a swipe at Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), claiming he \"would like to stay in the Middle East for the next thousand years with thousands of soldiers, fighting other people\u2019s wars.\"", "description": ".10/16/2019 16:38:56PM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/289/86e9ee4b-8a28-4406-b523-caa48f283990.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
