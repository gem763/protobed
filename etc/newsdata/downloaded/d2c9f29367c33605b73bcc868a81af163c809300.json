'All over the world they're talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safer place by comparison. It's true.'\n\n'I said, 'Where is he? I want to talk to him?'' Trump vented about Johnson. 'In fact more than anyone else, this person should be here, because maybe he could learn something.'\n\nPresident Donald Trump blasted Chicago's police chief for snubbing his speech during an event for police chiefs in the city\n\nJohnson had said that 'the values of the people of Chicago are more important than anything President Trump would have to say.'\n\n'I don't think so,' Trump responded. 'Because that's a very insulting statement after all I've done for the police. And I've done more than any other president has ever done for the police.'\n\n'And here's a man that could not bother to show up for a meeting of police chiefs, the most respected people in the country, in his hometown, and with the President of the United States,' he added.\n\nChicago's gun violence epidemic has become a frequently cited statistic, with 565 murders in 2018 and 13,067 shootings since Johnson took over the department.\n\nThe president went after actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with staging a hate-crime attack on himself\n\n'Chicago has the toughest gun laws in the United States. That doesn't seem to be working too well, does it?' asked the president, who is a vocal backer of the Second Amendment.\n\nTrump also tore into actor Jussie Smollett, who was charged with staging a hate-crime attack on himself. The FBI is investigating after Smollett reached a deal with local prosecutors.\n\n'Jussie Smollett, who beat up \u00ad\u2013 himself!' Trump said. 'And he said MAGA country did it! MAGA country,' Trump said. He called Smollett a 'wise guy.'\n\n'He said it's a hate crime. A hate crime. And it's a big scam, just like the impeachment of your president is a scam. ... Smollett is still trying to get away with it,' Trump said.\n\n'It's real big scam,' he added.\n\nHe said it's a hate crime. A hate crime. And it's a big scam, just like the impeachment of your presidnet is a scam. ... Smolett is still trying to get away with it\n\nTrump retold a story about a police motorcycle squad leader who supervised a volunteer corps of cops greeting him on a Chicago airport tarmac after an event before he took office.\n\n'The leader of the brigade was this really powerful, strong-looking guy. Big, booming voice, and he was definitely the boss,' Trump recalled, mimicking his barked orders as the officers assembled for a group photo.\n\n''Put your cycles over here! Come on, let's go. He's going to take a picture. Come on, let's go. Hurry up! Come on!'' he aped. 'And yet they all loved him.'\n\nTrump said the 'boss' complained about a lack of leadership from the office of then-mayor Rahm Emanuel, and from the top ranks of the city's police administration.\n\nAsked how long it would take him to clean up the city, Trump said, the man replied: ''One day, sir. These cops are great. They know all the bad guys, sir. They know exactly what to do. We could straighten it out so quickly that your head would spin'.'\n\nTrump said he recommended the man for a leadership job but 'that's the last time I ever heard of' him.\n\nTrump has told a similar story in the past, claiming the unnamed commander had told him it would take a week, not a day, to reform the department.\n\nTrump's appearance at a police chiefs conference will be his first visit as president to Chicago, a city he has ridiculed for years. The city's top cop plans to skip the speech, even though he's hosting the event.\n\nPolice Superintendent Eddie Johnson's snub of Trump's speech Monday at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference is the latest chapter in a long and contentious relationship between the Republican president and the nation's third-largest city, a Democratic stronghold.\n\n'The values of the people of Chicago are more important to him than anything that could be discussed at that speech,' Johnson's spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said shortly after the White House announced Trump's planned address at the conference.\n\nJohnson told a local CBS affiliate: 'I can\u2019t in good conscience stand by while racial insults and hatred are cast from the Oval Office or is held hostage because of our views on new Americans.'\n\nGuglielmi added that Johnson will be hosting and attending several events at the conference.\n\nPresident Trump gestures while speaking during a Cabinet meeting in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Monday, October 21. he is due to make his first official visit to Chicago as president\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson is pictured above during a March 2019 press conference. He will not attend President Trump's first visit to Chicago since taking office\n\nSince his campaign, Trump has repeatedly singled out the city, both for what he says is its unwillingness to get tough on criminals and what he complains is a willingness to coddle immigrants living in the country illegally. His mere presence in the city prompted him to leave without making a speech at a campaign rally in 2016 after protesters and supporters clashed even before he made it to the stage.\n\nEven before that, he drew the ire of city officials when he attached 20-foot-tall letters spelling 'TRUMP' on the side of his Trump International Hotel and Tower. Trump took great pleasure when then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel concluded there was nothing he could do about the letters, no matter how 'architecturally tasteless' they were.\n\nTrump blamed the Chicago Tribune's architecture critic for stirring up opposition about the signage, calling him a 'third-rate architectural critic.' It was a precursor to his more recent ridicule of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as either a 'third-rate' or 'third-grade' politician.\n\nMore recently, Trump has used the city's surge in gun violence to call for a crackdown on criminals.\n\n'What the hell is going on in Chicago?' he asked at a 2017 rally in Florida. 'There are those who say that Afghanistan is safer than Chicago, OK?... You know what's wrong with Chicago? Weak, ineffective politicians. Democrats ...'\n\nIn another rally that year, Trump singled out Emanuel, telling the audience: 'Better tell that mayor to get tough because it's not working what they're doing.'\n\nTrump has even suggested that Chicago should embrace the stop-and-frisk policing method in which large numbers of people are temporarily detained, questioned and sometimes searched for drugs even after it was deemed unconstitutional.\n\nHe has spoken numerous times about an unnamed Chicago police officer who lamented that the department could stop the violence if they let officers do their job. That story, depending on the telling, has the officer saying police could clean things up 'immediately,' ''in one week,' or 'two days.'\n\nTrump tweeted in early 2017 that he would 'send in the Feds' if 'Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on.' Johnson responded by saying he didn't know what Trump was suggesting he was going to do, and Emanuel rejected the president's offer if that was to send in the National Guard.\n\nThe president has made false assertions about gun violence in Chicago, starting with his contention during his campaign that the city has the toughest gun laws in the United States. By the time Trump the candidate was making that assertion in 2015, many of the city's gun laws had either been overturned or gutted. Then, shortly after he was inaugurated in 2017, he claimed two people were fatally shot during former president Barack Obama's farewell address a few weeks earlier.\n\nEddie Johnson, the Chicago police superintendent, will not be in the audience when President Trump delivers a speech in front of the International Association of Chiefs of Police Conference. File photo of Johnson in January 2017\n\nThe Tribune reported that its own database showed 'no slayings for about 24 hours before or after Obama's speech.'\n\nA reference to the city made it into a statement former Trump attorney Michael Cohen released earlier this year before an appearance in front of the U.S. House. He spoke of Trump driving through a struggling Chicago neighborhood and remarking that only black people could live that way.\n\nChicago also has taken a leading role in the president's battle with so-called sanctuary cities.\n\nAfter a federal appeals court ruled that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions could not tie the distribution of federal grant money to cities' willingness to cooperate with immigration authorities, a federal judge ruled in favor of the city in its lawsuit over the Justice Department's attempt to tie the money to new immigration requirements, including giving federal agents access to local jails.\n\nBut just a few months ago, a federal appeals judge ruled that the Justice Department could give preferential treatment in awarding community policing grants to cities that cooperate with immigration authorities.\n\nWhen Trump later said he was strongly considering placing 'Illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only,' Emanuel quickly shot back that Chicago would 'welcome these migrants with open arms.'\n\nJohnson's announcement about the conference comes just days after he told reporters that he was ordering an internal investigation of himself after he was found asleep in his SUV at a stop light. Officers let him drive home without a roadside sobriety test. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Johnson acknowledged to her that he'd had 'a couple drinks with dinner.'", "description": "Chicago Police Superintendent\u00a0Eddie Johnson did not attend President Trump's speech in his city next week, despite hosting a police chiefs' conference.", "authors": ["David Martosko", "U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/19/20293408-0-image-a-23_1572289565541.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
