'I am honoured and delighted to be appointed to referee the final,' he said.\n\nGarces upset Wales with his officiating in their semi-final defeat at the hands of South Africa\n\n'It is a dream as a referee, but this is a team sport, and as a team of four, we will be out there to do the best for the teams, the fans, the sport, but also the entire match officials team, selectors and support team, who have worked so hard over the last four years.'\n\nIt will be Garces' 11th World Cup match, and his 55th test match as a referee.\n\nSouth Africa have only won two of their last 11 test matches refereed by Garces, although one of them was the 19-16 semi-final victory.", "description": "Injuries are sadly part-and-parcel of sport and one has robbed the man who is widely-considered the best referee on the planet from officiating the upcoming Rugby World Cup final.", "authors": ["Luke Augustus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/13/20327410-0-image-a-5_1572356368322.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
