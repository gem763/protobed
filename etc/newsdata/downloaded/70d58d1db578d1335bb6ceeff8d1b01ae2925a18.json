Their unique strategies will determine who gets that shot", "language": "en", "text": "Each of the five leading 2020 Democratic candidates can beat the president in a general election, according to the latest national match-up polls. But first, they will need to secure the party\u2019s nomination in a hotly contested primary season that started with more than two dozen hopefuls. They\u2019re each using very different tactics to do so.\n\nThose five candidates \u2014 Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg \u2014 joined each other on Thursday night for the third Democratic debate, along with five additional candidates currently polling beneath them: Cory Booker, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Julian Castro.\n\nThe debate marked the first time Americans saw all of the top Democrats on stage at once, discussing everything from climate change to gun control policy in a three-hour display credited with tackling a range of issues. For the most part the candidates were virtually in agreement with their visions for the future of the country, albeit with different plans and initiatives to effect change.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nEach candidate said they wanted to expand health insurance to the vast majority of Americans, for example, but Mr Biden and Ms Harris expressed support for a public option while Mr Sanders and Ms Warren took on a Medicare-for-All stance (Mr Buttigieg falls somewhere in between with a \u201cMedicare-for-All who want it\u201d plan, as he described it). Reducing carbon emissions, lowering prescription drug prices, achieving universal access to a quality education, ending the president\u2019s trade wars: these are all staples of every Democratic presidential platform.\n\nWhat separates the men and women vying for a shot at unseating Mr Trump in the Oval Office are not their policy proposals so much as their campaigning strategies, a fact that became increasingly clear during Thursday night\u2019s debate.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Well, I\u2019m for Barack.\u201d Ms Warren later credited the former president, saying: \u201cWe all owe a huge debt to President Obama, who fundamentally transformed healthcare in America.\u201d\n\nMr Buttigieg delivered a personal touch, recalling his military experience when discussing the need to end \u201cforever wars\u201d in Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nThe openly-gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, discussed his coming out story on the debate stage \u2014 a move that would have been considered unthinkable just a few years ago \u2014 and how his sexuality factored into his political life.\n\n\u201cYou know, as a military officer serving under Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell and as an elected official in the state of Indiana when Mike Pence was governor, at a certain point, when it came to professional setbacks, I had to acknowledge whether just being who I was, was going to be the ultimate career-ending professional setback,\u201d he said. \u201cI came back from the deployment and realised that you only get to live one life and I was not interested in not knowing what it was like to be in love any longer.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris meanwhile has focused almost all of her energy on Donald Trump after having previously sky-rocketed in the polls when she attacked Mr Biden at the first debates over his record on school segregation. She came with a prepared set of fiery one-liners, including when she said Mr Trump was tweeting \u201cthe ammunition\u201d for violent white supremacists behind a number of recent mass shootings across the country.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, you have spent the last two-and-a-half years full time trying to sow hate and division among us, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve gotten nothing done,\u201d she said.\n\nIt remains unclear what approach the majority of Democratic voters may be more inclined to support in order to defeat Mr Trump \u2014 an attack-dog style candidate who isn\u2019t afraid to take the gloves off, or one with a uniting spirit attempting to restore civility in the national political conversation.\n\nWith the bulk of their policy initiatives having already been unveiled, the latest debate was a chance for each candidate to share their winning strategies with the American public. While polls are likely to rise and fall for all 10 candidates who took the stage on Thursday night, the true test for their newly-formed strategies will arrive when the first primary voters begin casting their ballots in February.", "description": "Each of the five leading 2020 Democratic candidates can beat the president in a general election, according to the latest national match-up polls.
