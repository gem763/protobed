But I was kept on and I was hoping for a permanent contract.\n\n\u201cBut I received a letter this week telling me my contract had been terminated due to issues around Brexit. It was a huge shock to me. I had been in almost every day so I assumed there was plenty of work.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Bartoline fillers and adhesives production manager Charles Weston writes: \u201cThe business is about to enter a potential turbulent time with the exit from the EU.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not expect any long term issues, we may experience a dip in orders as we enter the changeover period.\n\n(Image: Jerome Ellerby)\n\n\u201cTo ensure that we are in the best position to deal with any change, it is with regret that I will need to terminate your contract.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank you for your hard efforts in the past and wish you all the best in securing another suitable position.\u201d\n\nMr Gajda, who lives in Hull, was given an extra week\u2019s notice beyond the statutory week.\n\nBut he said: \u201cI am angry as this came out of the blue. There was no indication my job was under threat.\n\n(Image: Jerome Ellerby)\n\n\u201cEven though I have come from Poland I was not that worried about Brexit so it is a huge shock to find I have been so directly affected. I don\u2019t know of any other workers at the company who have lost their jobs because of this.\n\n\u201cI have no plans to return to Poland and I will just have to try and find a new job. I have just bought new car insurance and I was settling down here.\u201d\n\nAlexandra Jastrzebska, who runs the Polish Bureau in Hull, said: \u201cI have never seen anything like this before and I couldn\u2019t believe Brexit was given as a reason to lose your job. This seems to me to be an awful reason and I worry whether it will happen to anyone else.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if it is Polish or eastern Europeans that are at risk or is it English people too?\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cI just hope the Polish community are not being targeted as we pay our taxes and contribute to the community and love being here.\"\n\nBartoline has been contacted for comment.\n\nMr Gajda received the letter as Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to reach a new Brexit deal with EU leaders.\n\nMr Johnson appealed to MPs to back his last-minute deal in an extraordinary sitting of Parliament on Saturday as his opponents attempted to derail the legislation.\n\nParliament was sitting for the first time on a Saturday in 37 years as the October 31 deadline drew closer.\n\nBut the Prime Minister faced another hurdle with opposition MPs threatening to vote for an amendment withholding approval until legislation to implement the deal is in place.\n\nSir Oliver Letwin, the former Cabinet minister who had the Tory whip withdrawn after rebelling over Brexit, said it was an \"insurance policy\" to prevent Britain \"crashing out\" without a deal on October 31.", "description": "Sebastian Gajda was shocked and angry after being told he was losing his job at Bartoline in Beverley, East Yorks, because Britain is entering a \"potential turbulent time\" with Brexit", "authors": ["James Campbell", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Jerome Ellerby"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653021.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JWE_HMB_18102019Brexitjobs_005JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
