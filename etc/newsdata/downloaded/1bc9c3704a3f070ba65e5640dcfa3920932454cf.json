There are plenty of references here to the earlier incarnations: Charles Addams\u2019 original cartoons for the New Yorker, the 1960s TV series and the two movies from the 1990s. But this uncreepy and decidedly unkooky film is a letdown.\n\nIt\u2019s also a waste of a killer voice cast. Charlize Theron is matriarch Morticia Addams (animated with none of the delicious vampire sexiness Anjelica Huston brought to the role). Oscar Issac is her husband Gomez, with Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Stranger Things\u2019 Finn Wolfhard playing the kids, Wednesday and Pugsley. Home is a former lunatic asylum above a New Jersey town; down the hill, interior decorator and reality TV star Margaux (Allison Janney), a woman with the pep and hairdo of Dolly Parton, is building 50 new houses. When the Addamses refuse to spruce up their eyesore of a gothic pile, Margaux launches a hate campaign against them, mobilising the narrow-minded townspeople.\n\nWhile their parents go to war, Wednesday and Margaux\u2019s tweenage daughter become friends. As an act of rebellion against her mother, Wednesday, nicely voiced by Moretz with a bored, been-there-killed-that drawl, connects with her inner optimist. (In one of the film\u2019s best scenes, she comes home from the mall wearing a rainbow-coloured unicorn hair clip to Morticia\u2019s horror: \u201cHow dare you bring that into my house!\u201d).\n\nEverything is locked and loaded for a heartwarming finale in which outsiders and conservative locals realise that actually they have a lot in common. Without a shred of irony, the film, which is essentially about resisting the pressure to conform or change yourself, has a storyline stitched together from a dozen family films you\u2019ve probably already seen. What\u2019s missing is a heartbeat.\n\n\u2022 The Addams Family is released in the UK on 25 October and in Australia on 5 December.", "description": "The latest incarnation of the mysterious and spooky household, from the directors of Sausage Party, is not creepy and not kooky \u2013 it\u2019s bland", "authors": ["Cath Clarke"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d671028827e5034d86ae13555bfcad45a4063e1/888_584_2803_1683/master/2803.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTIucG5n&enable=upscale&s=016e1991e63afaa334865f2a6f191ec6", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
