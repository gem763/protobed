Expect it will receive strong bipartisan support,' the senator tweeted.\n\nDemocrats also hammered the president. Senator Bernie Sanders, who seeks the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination, tweeted that while he supports ending US military intervention in the Middle East, Trump's 'extremely irresponsible' announcement is 'likely to result in more suffering and instability.'\n\nSouth Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, tweeted that the president's move 'will be a stain on America's honor' and 'is a disaster in the making'\n\nHillary Clinton, the former secretary of state Trump defeated in 2016, accused the president of committing 'a sickening betrayal both of the Kurds and his oath of office.'\n\nAfter a call between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the White House said Ankara would 'soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria' - and that US forces would 'no longer be in the immediate area.'\n\nThe announcement stunned and angered several Republicans.\n\n'Withdrawing US forces from Northern Syria is a catastrophic mistake that puts our gains against ISIS at risk and threatens US security,' tweeted Liz Cheney, the number three House Republican.\n\nSenator Mitt Romney called the withdrawal 'a betrayal' that facilitates a jihadist resurgence.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to defend the withdrawal, saying the region would have to 'figure the situation out.'\n\n'The Kurds fought with us, but were paid massive amounts of money and equipment to do so,' he said.\n\n'They have been fighting Turkey for decades. I held off this fight for almost 3 years but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.'\n\nThe strident objections included a slap by Trump's former UN envoy Nikki Haley, a Republican seen by some as a potential post-Trump presidential candidate.\n\n'We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back,' Haley said, calling the Kurds 'instrumental' in the US fight against ISIS.\n\n'Leaving them to die is a big mistake.'", "description": "The White House said Ankara would 'soon be moving forward with its long-planned operation into Northern Syria' - and that US forces would 'no longer be in the immediate area.'", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/17/19404522-0-image-a-37_1570464946643.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
