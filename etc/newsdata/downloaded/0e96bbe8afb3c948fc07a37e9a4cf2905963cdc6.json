Due to this, #FacebookLockout is trending on twitter with many users angry at the social network\u2019s strange behavior.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s happening, if you report an impersonating account, Facebook will lock your account and ask for an ID for verification. However, even if you scan your ID, it won\u2019t let you in. Check out the video below for example:\n\n2/ Thousand's of facebook user's facing this sh**ty problem! just tap this hashtag here #FacebookLockout Just like this clip! pic.twitter.com/IBbCtbszBl \u2014 Sayeed Joy (@thesayeedjoy) October 13, 2019\n\nAs Cory Comer, who got locked out for more than a week, highlights in his Twitter thread, this affects Facebook pages and Instagram ads too. That means admins who manage such pages can\u2019t access business accounts, and might even lose money.\n\n2/ The #FacebookLockout affects #facebook, @FBBusiness, @Instagram Ads, and 3rd party Facebook Authentication. All manner of login pages are automatically redirected to single verification page with a photo upload requirement. \u2014 Cory Comer (@corywcomer) October 14, 2019\n\nDefinite affect . Loss of profits , disgruntled customers , a knock on effect in terms of looking unprofessional. Affected ad campaigns and so on . #facebooklockout \u2014 Kara (@Karascents) October 13, 2019\n\nThese incidents are not quite new. Some folks were reporting this issue back in July.\n\n@facebook when are you going to acknowledge that there are serious issues for thousands of users? You locked me out of my decade old account, and SMS code verification is dead along with Friends photo verification system. Acknowledge then proceed to fix, been already a WEEK, plz! \u2014 policymaker (@The_Policymaker) July 10, 2019\n\nThis is not just an issue for accessing accounts. There\u2019s a security threat at play as well. Last month, security researcher, Sayeed Joy, created a fake account of Android Police\u2019s founder, Artem Russakovskii, and managed to lock out the real account by reporting it. He managed to get into his account by contacting Facebook, however, he was locked out last night again.\n\n-____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________- \u2014 Artem Russakovskii (@ArtemR) September 23, 2019\n\nWhile plenty of users are reporting they got back in the account, some others are still locked out.\n\nTNW sent an email to Facebook to understand more about the issue last night. At the time of writing the story, there\u2019s no word from the company.\n\nThere are core questions of ways users can access their accounts and reach out to Facebook support. A lot of people couldn\u2019t reach the support forms, because, well\u2026they were locked out. Plus, there\u2019s no clarification as to why despite providing valid IDs, people were still unable to access their accounts.\n\nThere\u2019s an issue of identity theft as well. Like any sane person, you would think of reporting an impersonator using tools provided by Facebook. But they are useless if they kick you out of the account for several days.\n\nRead next: Victim of $5B OneCoin cryptocurrency scam gets death threats for speaking out", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FFacebook-lock.png&signature=c417b1fd1eb97022506d1ecd0d1ecfaf", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
