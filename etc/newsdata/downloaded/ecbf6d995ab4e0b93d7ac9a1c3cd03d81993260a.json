Bella picked up on this and added a gluten-free setting to the two-slice Bella Pro Series 90062. It works as promised, turning out nicely browned gluten-free toast. As for regular bread, the Bella earns an Excellent rating in our time tests, putting it among the fastest two-slice models in our ratings. Overall, it combines top performance and a reasonable price, making it a CR Best Buy.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Toasters From Consumer Reports' Tests\n\nBlack+Decker 4-Slice TO1755SB\n\nCR's take: This Black+Decker toaster oven is rated Excellent at making toast. And it's adept at reheating lasagna and baking muffins and cookies, all for hundreds less than many of the other toaster ovens recommended in our ratings.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Toaster Ovens From Consumer Reports' Tests\n\nLodge Cast Iron Pre-seasoned\n\nCR\u2019s take: Lodge has been making cast-iron frying pans in its Tennessee foundry since 1896. This 12-inch Lodge is top-notch at browning scallops and earns an Excellent rating for searing a steak. Baking is only so-so, though. Heating evenness is also mediocre. It weighs 7.8 pounds, which is about average in this category.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Cast Iron Frying Pans From Consumer Reports' Tests\n\nCalphalon Contemporary Nonstick\n\nCR's take: A 10-inch nonstick pan, this Calphalon Contemporary pan is made of anodized aluminum\u2014the aluminum has been through a process that hardens its surface and prevents aluminum from leaching into acidic foods. Food cooks evenly, earning it a Very Good rating in that test. When the pan is new, you'll have to nudge food out of the pan a little, and, like all frying pans, more so as the coating starts to wear.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Frying Pans for $40 or Less\n\nHamilton Beach 12-cup Programmable 49465R\n\nCR's take: An extraordinary value, this inexpensive drip coffee maker beat dozens of pricier models in CR\u2019s battery of tests. Brew performance is Excellent, and it can be programmed to have piping fresh coffee waiting in the morning.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Drip Coffee Makers From Consumer Reports' Tests\n\nCuisinart Mini Prep Plus DLC-2A\n\nCR's take: A top chopper in tests, Cuisinart\u2019s 3-cup model combines great value with solid performance. It's particularly adept at chopping (we test with almonds and onions) and grating (hard Parmesan cheese), earning it Very Good ratings in both tests.\n\n\n\nFor more options, check our food processors and choppers buying guide.\n\nCuisinart Smart Stick CSB-75\n\nCR's take: Excellent at pur\u00e9eing vegetables for soup, this gadget\u2014the perfect size to fit in a drawer\u2014is also great at blending yogurt. The Smart Stick also comes with a three-year warranty, better than most we tested.\n\n\n\nFor more options, check our buying guides and ratings for blenders.\n\nChefman Anti-Overflow Belgian Waffle Maker\n\nCR\u2019s take: The Chefman was the only waffle maker we tested to snag a CR Best Buy designation. For far less money than most of the competition, this machine churns out evenly browned round waffles. It garners a Very Good rating for its color-range settings, meaning there\u2019s a remarkable difference between waffles made on the darkest setting (brown and crispy) and lightest setting (light and fluffy). Pros include an indicator to let you know when the waffles are ready, the option to store it vertically to save space, and a batter cup for precise portioning. Con: The handle and latch get uncomfortably warm during cooking, so you may want to use an oven mitt when opening and closing the lid.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Waffle Makers From Consumer Reports' Tests\n\nCuisinart Power Advantage HM-50\n\nCR's take: Cuisinart\u2019s well-priced 5-speed hand mixer has no trouble powering through stiff cookie dough in our tests, and it's very quick at whipping heavy cream. We also like the mixer\u2019s wire beaters, which are easier to clean than the traditional center-post variety. But this mixer is louder than other models in CR's tests. Still, hand mixers are used in such short bursts that the noise may not bother you.\n\n\n\nFor more options, check our mixer buying guide and ratings.\n\nBlack+Decker PowerCrush PB2000G\n\nCR's take: The sleek PowerCrush PB2000G can crank out smoothies every morning, no problem: It earns an Excellent rating in our tests for making icy drinks. Family members and roommates will appreciate it, too, because this blender earns a Very Good rating in our noise test, meaning it\u2019s relatively quiet. (All the other blenders we tested rate only a Good or Fair.) Black+Decker\u2019s personal blenders earn a Very Good rating for predicted reliability, based on data from CR\u2019s member survey.\n\n\n\nFor more options: Best Personal Blenders for Smoothies To-Go\n\nConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.
