But I can't help but think City will come back and go on a winning run.\n\n\"Both teams were in the same position last year and City came back at them.\n\n\"If Liverpool could win the City game, not just for the points, but psychologically, that would put them in a great position.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"In this moment, Liverpool are slight favourites, if they were to reach the international break on the back of two wins, that would put them nine points clear.\n\n\"They'd take some stopping then, they'd be big favourites.\"\n\nThe Reds host Arsenal in the Carabao Cup fourth round at Anfield on Wednesday night.", "description": "The former Reds defender insists his old side are still just slight favourites for the crown, but says that could change soon", "authors": ["Mark Jones", "Image", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20758120.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Roy-Keane-laughs-at-Jamie-Carragher-as-he-references-Liverpools-title-failures.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
