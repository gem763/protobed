Shortly after, Tarlos, the ruling party incumbent, conceded defeat on Sunday night.\n\n\u201cOn the national level the result is nice but in Budapest, there is thinking to be done,\u201d Tarlos told a news conference flanked by Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister. \u201cBudapest made the decision to elect Gergely Karacsony today.\u201d\n\nDespite Tarlos\u2019s reference to the national picture, opposition parties were also projected to win mayoral races in around 10 of the country\u2019s 23 largest cities in nationwide local elections. In 2014, they won just three of those races.\n\nAt nearly 50%, Sunday\u2019s voting had one of the highest voter turnouts in local elections since Hungary\u2019s 1990 return to democracy.\n\nDespite the disappointing results, analysts said they expect Orb\u00e1n, who led his party to landslide victories in all major elections since 2010, to continue with his combative style, which includes strong anti-migrant policies, increasing domination of the media and a centralised power structure built around the prime minister\u2019s office.", "description": "Gergely Karacsony\u2019s victory is one of many defeats across Hungary for Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party", "authors": ["Agencies In Budapest"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b21633af33afa8c5ef8ad7014d5f2869a07ac6a7/521_19_1903_1142/master/1903.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0e9fc7a2783bbf9bf94a5324c875fd8a", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
