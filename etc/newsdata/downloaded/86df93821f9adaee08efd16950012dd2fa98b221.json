He was prosecuted as master of the vessel, despite not driving it at the time.\n\nSouth Cumbria Magistrates' Court heard that patrol officers spotted Webster, from Bury, near Manchester, on an e-board \u2013 a short board on which the skier kneels \u2013 being towed by his friend in his \u00a313,000 speedboat.\n\nJulie Wood, prosecuting on behalf of Lake District National Park Authority (LDNPA), said: 'No powered vessel should exceed ten knots [11.5mph] or the master of the vessel is liable for prosecution and a fine up to \u00a3500.\n\n'On April 23, ranger Jack Holmes was on patrol when he saw a red vessel and believed it was in excess of the speed limit.\n\n'They pulled alongside and obtained details of the boat. It was registered to Mr Webster. They tried to caution Mr Webster as the registered owner and the defendant said, 'You have the same power as the Salvation Army'. '\n\nHe dismissed the officials who stopped his boat \u2013 and warned him that he faced prosecution and a \u00a3500 fine \u2013 as having 'the same power as the Salvation Army' (pictured with his family)\n\nWebster had pleaded not guilty to the charges in July, but changed his plea this week to guilty of navigating a vessel in excess of the limit. Stuart Page, defending, said: 'He was just over the limit. There was no one else on the lake. This is not a case of recklessness.' The court fined Webster \u00a3400, ordered him to pay \u00a31,000 costs and pay a \u00a340 victim surcharge.\n\nThe LDNPA had claimed \u00a37,107 costs, which magistrates refused.\n\nRobert Maddocks, chairman of the bench, criticised Webster for his lack of remorse and 'a level of arrogance and belligerence'.\n\nSpeaking after the hearing, Webster said: 'What made me angry was the way they came after me with blue lights flashing and the siren going. I told them they were acting like police officers when all they were doing was enforcing a bylaw like not playing ball games on grass. I do regret alluding to being brought before a 'kangaroo court'. I think that is why I ended up being prosecuted.'", "description": "David Webster, 45, from Bury, near Manchester, said\u00a0officials had 'the same power as the Salvation Army'.
