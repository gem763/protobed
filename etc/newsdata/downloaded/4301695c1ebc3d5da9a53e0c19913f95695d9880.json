It was estimated at 1.12 billion with digital media audiences included.\n\nGlobal average in-home audience is the gold standard of verified viewers for a full broadcast. It was 15.29 million in the United States and 5.48 million in the Netherlands.\n\nFIFA research says a bigger audience than the 2015 final - a 5-2 win for the Americans over Japan in Vancouver, Canada - could have been more but for the time zone being less favorable for American viewers, and the Dutch market being smaller than Japan.\n\nFIFA says the 1.12 billion people watching at least one minute of the 52-game tournament included 342 million in China.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "FIFA research says the Women's World Cup final drew an average audience of 82.18 million in-home viewers - 56% more than the 2015 final.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/18/megan_rapinoe_pay_fight_soccer_82825_c0-222-5340-3337_s1200x700.jpg?89beda0e40d48e382e5dae0861c0e75b3e111d36", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
