It must be persuasive. And so we should be asking: What is it about \u201cHispanic invasion\u201d that was so convincing to El Paso mass shooting suspect Patrick Crusius?\n\nThat\u2019s where we on the left are partly to blame.\n\nAs it is, we show little political will to stop the surge of migrants at our southern border \u2014 144,000 in May alone, a 13-year high \u2014 or the rise in migrants misusing U.S. asylum laws to seek economic opportunity.\n\nWe ignore realistic concerns about the skill and education levels of those we\u2019re letting in, and we demonize anyone worried about how these convulsions will impact national identity and assimilation as a xenophobe. We\u2019re now against a wall we didn\u2019t oppose during the Barack Obama era, when there were fewer illegal crossings.\n\nAnd through it all, we may still elect a presidential candidate who favors decriminalizing illegal border crossings and extending health care to undocumented migrants, even as most Americans oppose such moves.\n\nAll this has earned us a reputation for favoring \u201copen borders,\u201d and breathed life into Donald Trump\u2019s nativist rhetoric. Suddenly, the notion of an invasion doesn\u2019t feel like a stretch to many Americans.\n\nIt should but it doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s not how the world works.\n\nTime and again, governments that fail to keep immigration flows at a level that doesn\u2019t seem to threaten national identity, tolerance wanes, panic sets in, as the collective mind shifts toward preservation. People stop seeing the myriad benefits of immigrants and more as a drain on resources and a threat to jobs and national security. (Immigrants in fact commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans do.)\n\nTo many, invasion is what it feels like. Promising a corrective, rightist parties rise, as has been the case across much of Europe amid massive influxes of immigrants from the Middle East and North Africa. Bastions of liberalism like the Netherlands and Denmark turn a dark corner. And to be sure, the fear of being overrun by foreigners is not exclusive to white conservatives, as anyone in a swiftly gentrifying neighborhood can attest.\n\nThat is, there\u2019s something deep within us as humans that responds viscerally when we feel overwhelmed by the other. Governments then must manage immigration in a way that does not unleash those fears. At the national level that includes tightening border security and not ignoring growing public concerns about what constitutes too much immigration.\n\nBut to a good many Americans it appears that we liberals aren\u2019t committed to managing immigration flows. Rather, we look intent to \u201cbrown\u201d the country with people who will align with us against our political enemies (all while some of us attempt to rewrite history to be hostile to our Founding Fathers and our most patriotic symbols).\n\nCrucially in times like these, we need a leader who reassures the public that we are not being flooded by a brown wave. President Trump is not such a leader.\n\nBut as the alleged shooter said in his manifesto, his racial resentment predated the president\u2019s rhetoric, and that is certainly true of many Americans. It is also true their views will outlive Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency and likely be adopted by more Americans \u2014 increasing the chances of yet another domestic terror attack \u2014 unless Democrats and Republicans both do more to tamp down fear and fix immigration.\n\nIn laying the blame squarely on Donald Trump, we on the left aren\u2019t going far enough to understand what people, more deeply, are responding to, and until we do, until show we are serious about confronting our immigration crisis, we will be forced to look back on another case of our well-meaning intentions going way different than planned.\n\n\u2022 Ioannis Gatsiounis is a writer in Texas.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
