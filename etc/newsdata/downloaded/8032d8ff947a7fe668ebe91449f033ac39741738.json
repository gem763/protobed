He decided to create a suitable guide dog for the couple.\n\nAfter three years of trying to find a solution, in 1989 Wally came up with the idea of \"a dog with the working ability of the Labrador and the coat of the poodle\".\n\nBut despite his success, he feels regret because the labradoodle became \"a bandwagon\" - and his aim of only breeding healthy pups was not followed by others.\n\n\"I find that the biggest majority [of labradoodles] are either crazy or have a hereditary problem.\"\n\nImage copyright Martha Watton Image caption Martha says she's \"never met a crazy labradoodle\"\n\n'The perfect companion'\n\nMany owners certainly won't recognise Wally's words, though.\n\nFor Martha Watton, 20, labradoodles like Barney are the dream dog.\n\n\"He has the perfect mix of lovingness, intelligence and everything. When I'm feeling down or stressed, he picks me up, comes for a cuddle and I feel better again,\" Martha told Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\nShe adds Barney is \"the perfect companion for anyone of any age\".\n\n\"My grandad has dementia and we take Barney to see him at the care home and he's the perfect calm dog to have around - he doesn't bark.\"\n\n'A member of our family'\n\nGrace Mandeville also agrees - she's owned Juno for nearly two years.\u200e\n\n\u200e\"She's a playful teddy bear who is obsessed with socks. Who \u200eneeds toys \u200efor your dog when you have your own socks?\u200e\n\n\u200e\"\u200eShe really is a member of our little family, plus I'm allergic to dogs and cats so there's a massive \u200ebonus \u200ethat I can share a sofa with her and not feel wheezy.\u200e\u200e\n\n\u200e\"Every morning she sits by the side of our bed waiting for us to allow her to come and give me \u200eand my \u200ehusband a cuddle.\u200e\"\n\nJohn Whitwell, a vet in York, says labradoodles are \"happy, healthy dogs\" with no major health problems.\n\n\"I don't think they're particularly crazy, they do seem to make good family pets, I don't think I've ever met one that was vicious or injured a family member.\"\n\nKeep calm and bark on...\n\nBut if you do have a particularly boisterous pooch, John says there are things you can do.\n\nWhat if they won't stop barking? As annoying as it may be, don't tell them off because they'll become \"the centre of attention\".\n\n\"Take the dog away to a quiet area, leave it for 10 minutes and then let it out.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Enjoying the calm of nature\n\nHe also advises you to channel your inner zen to avoid your dog doing laps of the house.\n\n\"When you get home, you're obviously happy to see your dog and they're happy to see you. But if you immediately go and greet the dog and you're excited, you reinforce that it's an exciting time.\"\n\n\"Just make a tea and once the dog has calmed down, only then say hello.\"\n\nBecause as we know, a cup of tea and a dog is a winning combo.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.\n\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.", "description": "'They're crazy' - the man who created the labradoodle says it's a huge regret.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C112/production/_108962494_image-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
