It's such a piece of history.\n\n'The letter is a response to an invitation to an event and her letter explains that she would have liked to have gone but she can't, because she's not very well.\n\n'Also, she's very concerned about healthcare and wants to introduce district nurses so that children can be looked after properly and be trained to go out in the community and look after the very sick.\n\n'Nightingale may be best known for her work during the war but I would say the idea of the NHS probably started with her because of her efforts to bring nursing and care to everyone in society.'\n\nMr Medhurst, who stars in the BBC's Antiques Road Trip, said: 'She says in her letter that she's been unwell at home for two years, and yet she is talking about going out and looking after other people and their sickness.\n\n'It talks about beginning of life care, in clothing and feeding children but then also end of life care which is what Weldmar is all about.\n\n'When it comes to value, with historical letters and signatures of famous people, it comes down to the content and why the were written - if she had mentioned soldiers on the front line, that would bring a big price.\n\n'This letter has a lot of writing by Florence Nightingale, so I would imagine it could fetch up to \u00a31,000. Well done Bev for finding it.'\n\nNightingale was one of 38 volunteer nurses from Britain who during the Crimean War went to medical stations in Turkey to help.\n\nShe became the face of the effort after a newspaper dubbed her 'the Lady with the Lamp'.\n\nWhen they arrived they discovered many of the soldiers were dying not from their wounds but from diseases like typhoid and cholera, which were rife in the army hospitals.\n\nShe fought to improve conditions with better sanitation, nutrition and more supplies, which saw the death rate fall.\n\nNightingale kept meticulous notes on the number of deaths and their causes and when she returned to Britain she campaigned to improve conditions for the army and then more generally in hospitals.\n\nShe used the data she had gathered to lobby the government for reform. The Royal Commission on the Health of the Army was created and Nightingale's testimony and statistical analysis was published with the commission's findings in 1858.\n\nNightingale died aged 90 in 1910.", "description": "The four page hand-written letter, addressed to a 'Mr Hollingsworth', fell out of a photo album during a house clearance at a deceased estate in Chickerell, near Dorchester, Dorset.", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/10/19781394-0-image-a-21_1571219446562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
