In this environment, American leadership is sidelined, instead replaced by partisan bickering. To us, this is unacceptable,\u201d the lawmakers wrote in an op-ed for The Hill on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cOur caucus seeks to take the politics out of this important issue. Instead, members will commit to an honest dialogue, through which we can develop solutions that solidify American environmental leadership, promote American workers, and make meaningful progress on protecting our environment.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs the issue of climate change has grown in the national dialogue in part due to a series of alarming international scientific reports, Republican rhetoric on the issue has also shifted.\n\nThe caucus now will offer members of the GOP along with Senate Democrats a chance to work together to pass legislation to address climate change, the two lawmakers say of the committee.\n\n\u201cWe may seem an unlikely pair to team up on this effort. We come from different political parties and represent different parts of the country, but we both recognize the importance of American leadership in addressing our changing climate,\u201d the two write.\n\nAccording to the op-ed, the lawmakers will largely look to technological developments and business for answers, pointing to innovations in energy efficiency at manufacturers and in the agricultural sector as well as carbon neutral pledges already being adopted individually across a number of industries.\n\n\u201cCongress can build on these efforts, giving American businesses the tools they need to get there,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.\n\nWhile the group in its current form is comprised of two members, the lawmakers say the Caucus will be made of an equal number of members on both side of the aisle and will only introduce legislation agreed to unanimously. The Caucus also plans to hold hearings with experts.\n\n\u201cWe will meet regularly and convene experts from across the political spectrum to discuss ideas such as developing economic incentives to reduce emissions, promoting the role of agriculture as a climate solution, and ensuring that any energy transition protects American energy consumers while supporting energy security and workforce development,\u201d the Op-ed reads.\n\nBoth Coons\u2019s and Braun\u2019s states rely heavily on the agriculture industry.", "description": "Democratic Sen.
