Among them were Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who amassed \u00a317million between 2007 and 2011.\n\nExecutives will also face questions over how the company managed to rack up \u00a31.7billion of debts and whether they could have done more to save it from going under.\n\nThe committee is also likely to ask bosses exactly when they knew the company was on the verge of collapse.\n\nIt has emerged that executives were told in August by its banks, including RBS, that it needed to raise another \u00a3200million for them to support a rescue deal negotiated over the summer.\n\nThis crucial development was kept from investors and sparked panic when it was leaked to the media on September 19, just a few days before the travel business collapsed.\n\nShares in Thomas Cook crashed by more than a fifth on the Friday, before last ditch rescue talks over the weekend.\n\nSwiss businessman Fankhauser, 58, has claimed the banks only insisted that the extra \u00a3200million was essential on September 9.", "description": "A letter sent to the travel giant's then chief exec Dr Peter Fankhauser, and signed on behalf of Gareth Davies, director general of the Department for Transport, confirmed there would be no rescue.", "authors": ["James Salmon For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
