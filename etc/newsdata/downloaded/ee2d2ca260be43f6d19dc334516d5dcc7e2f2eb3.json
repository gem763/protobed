The Supreme Court Order in July, however, meant a hike in the cost of deploying them.\n\nThe daily allowance for the home guards is now Rs 672, up from the Rs 500 before the court order.\n\nThe government said this would have cost the state an extra expenditure of Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore every month. It, therefore, decided not to deploy home guards meant for security at police stations and traffic signals.\n\nAccording to an order that was issued by Additional Director General (ADG) BP Jogdand, \"The decision not to deploy 25,000 home guards was taken on August 28 this year in a meeting chaired by the Uttar Pradesh chief secretary.\"\n\nUttar Pradesh Director General of Police OP Singh said this step has been taken due to the extra financial burden on the police department following the court order and it is a temporary one.\n\n\"After the Supreme Court order, the police department would have had to bear the extra burden of Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore per month. This decision of not giving postings is a temporary one, and if and when required they will be called for duty,\" the DGP said.\n\nLater, the government said no one would be removed.\n\nWhen asked Home Guard Minister Chetan Chauhan told PTI, \"No home guard will be removed. I have talked to officers of the police department and asked them not to remove anyone. They might reduce their working days.\"\n\nThe home guards are not permanent employees and are recruited on a casual basis. They do not have any fixed monthly salary and are paid based on the number of days of duty.\n\nTill now they have been expected to work for 25 days but the government may decrease it to 15 days.\n\nEarlier when asked about the matter, UP Chief Secretary RK Tiwari told reporters in Ayodhya, \"Diwali will be celebrated in every household. We are mulling on how this problem can be resolved.\"\n\nWith PTI Inputs / Featured Image Credit: The Tribune", "description": "Faced with severe ire of the people, including opposition leaders, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government in the state of Uttar Pradesh has decided not to do away with 25,000 home guards but may instead reduce their working days to meet its financial constraints.", "authors": ["Saket Suman"], "top_image": "https://media.indiatimes.in/media/facebook/2019/Oct/home_guards_1571207146_800x420.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
