Prolonged uncertainties surrounding Brexit would only ensure that sterling remains susceptible to the UK's political risk,\" Tan added.", "description": "Stocks are rallying on Thursday after both China and the US said that trade talks would resume in October.\u00a0 The talks are later than initially planne...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5d70b8952e22af53f6012953-2400/rtx16sj9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
