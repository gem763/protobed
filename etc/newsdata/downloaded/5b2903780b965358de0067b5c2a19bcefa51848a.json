But when it\u2019s about police brutality and social injustice, it\u2019s not cool,\u2019 \u201d Cromartie said. \u201cI told Chuck Pagano that. I told him straight up, \u2018Man, that\u2019s (expletive).\u2019 \"\n\nPagano underwent treatments for a leukemia diagnosis in the middle of the 2012 season, which forced him to miss the second half of that season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all \u2018football is bigger than what is going on the outside,\u2019 \u201d Cromartie continued. \u201cNo it ain\u2019t. How about respecting the guys that\u2019s getting murdered and killed by police officers? And I\u2019m not saying all police officers is bad. But you get some, they get that little power in they hand and they abuse that power.\u201d\n\nNFL MIDSEASON WINNERS, LOSERS:Who made the most of first eight weeks?\n\nMORE:Back in the NFL, Steelers QB Paxton Lynch hopes to revive career\n\nDuring the fall owners meetings in 2016, Colts owner Jim Irsay said he didn\u2019t think NFL games were the proper venue for players to express their personal views.\n\n\u201cIt hasn't been a positive thing,\u201d Irsay said of the protests. \u201cWhat we all have to be aware of as players, owners, PR people, equipment managers, is when the lights go on we are entertainment. We are being paid to put on a show. There are other places to express yourself.\u201d\n\nCromartie played 11 seasons in the league with the Chargers, Jets, Cardinals and Colts. He played in Indianapolis for less than one season. The team cut him after Week 4 of the 2016 season, when he was 32 years old.\n\n\u201cI can remember me, right before the national anthem, first time I took a knee,\u201d Cromartie said. \u201cWhat\u2019s funny is, two or three of the executive guys were standing behind me and was like, \u2018Cro, get up.\u2019 I was like \u2018Man, (expletive) y\u2019all, I\u2019m not getting up.\u2019\n\n\u201cOne person even had a towel to try to block it, you know for nobody wanting to take a picture, but they already had took a picture.\"\n\nIn several photographs taken from the Week 3 game, there are various personnel standing near Cromartie, but no one with a towel is visible in the images. Players and equipment managers appeared to be standing near Cromartie.\n\n\u201cAnd then Week 4, we are in London and they came up to me before the game and was like, \u2018Hey, Cro, please don\u2019t take a knee.\u2019 So it was like, \u2018Man, y\u2019all better get out my face. Y\u2019all not fitting to sit here and tell me what I can and cannot do.' I actually got benched that game. I got pulled out at halftime, and didn\u2019t play the second half at all.\u201d\n\nWhile Cromartie did get benched, he also struggled in the game, allowing several big receptions to then-Jaguars receiver Allen Robinson, including a 3-yard touchdown in the first quarter in which Cromartie was turned around on a double move.\n\nCromartie also recounted how the Colts called him to release him two days after the London game. He said Pagano eventually told him that Indianapolis was cutting him because other defensive backs were getting healthy. Cromartie said he asked Pagano directly if his release had anything to do with his kneeling, and the cornerback said the coach reiterated that it was only because the team was getting healthier.\n\n\u201cI've said it before and I will say it again, every decision that we make as far as our roster goes and this team goes, is based on two things \u2013 what is best for this team and what gives us the best chance to win,\u201d Pagano said after Cromartie was released.\n\nCromartie said he believed his decision kneel ended his career led to other teams not signing him.\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d Cromartie said. \u201cOne hundred percent. It ain\u2019t have nothing to do with my age. It ain\u2019t have nothing to do with my style of play. It was because I took a knee. October 2nd was my last game. I got one workout that whole entire time, and that was by the Saints in 2017.\u201d\n\nCromartie also said he got \u201cdeath threats\u201d over his kneeling, but said he didn\u2019t regret his decision to protest social injustice.\n\n\u201cWhy should I?\u201d Cromartie said when asked if he regretted his decision to kneel. \u201c 'Cause at the end of the day, all we did was give people a voice that didn\u2019t have a voice. And it brought more attention to what really was going on and now everybody\u2019s talking about it. But there\u2019s still no solution because it\u2019s still going on.\u201d\n\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.", "description": "Former NFL cornerback Antonio Cromartie said that ex-Colts coach Chuck Pagano told his team not to kneel during the national anthem.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/30/USAT/fb752f1c-df08-4286-9a0c-189464562c2b-USATSI_9584137.jpg?crop=2921,1643,x45,y811&width=2353&height=1643&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
