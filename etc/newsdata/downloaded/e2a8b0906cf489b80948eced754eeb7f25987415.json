Its stock now rests up 138%, and one team of analysts is convinced the growth isn\u2019t over.\n\nThe Rating\n\nBank of America analysts led by Justin Post upgraded Snap to a buy and maintained an $18 price target.\n\nThe Thesis\n\nThe stock has waned a bit since striking its all-time high in August. It\u2019s now down 23% from its peak despite strong industry ad spending. This is one factor informing Bank of America\u2019s upgrade.\n\n\u201cThe Street appears to be concerned on high 3Q DAU [daily active user] growth expectations and 4Q DAU weakness given recent Ad Manager checks that suggest declines in Sept/Oct ad user reach,\u201d the analysts wrote in a note. \u201cWe note that Ad Manager doesn\u2019t track DAUs (which Snap reports) and we think strong ROW Android downloads, engagement with Discover content, and normal 4Q usage seasonality (as shown in 2016/17) will drive user growth in-line with our 4 million-plus 4Q quarter-over-quarter estimate.\u201d\n\nTheir optimism is bolstered by continued content releases for Discover, which could drive expansion in average revenue per user.\n\n\u201cWe think Discover content is a better format for Snap to monetize the high levels of engagement on Snap, while the launch of dynamic ads out of Beta will give Snap a new format to better compete for eCommerce spend in 2020,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBy Bank of America\u2019s estimates, accelerated user adoption of over-the-top services could drive ad spending in online video through 2021, which would further work in Snap\u2019s favor.\n\nThe fourth-quarter is projected to be Snap's first term with positive earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.\n\nPrice Action\n\nAt time of publication, Snap shares were set to open up 3.3% at $14.26.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nWhat To Expect From Q3 Internet Earnings\n\nThe Launch Of Instagram's Threads Hits Snapchat's Stock\n\nLatest Ratings for SNAP\n\nDate Firm Action From To Oct 2019 Initiates Coverage On Neutral Oct 2019 Upgrades Neutral Buy Oct 2019 Upgrades Neutral Buy\n\nView More Analyst Ratings for SNAP\n\nView the Latest Analyst Ratings\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2019 Benzinga.com.
