Over four million people generally do not have access to clean drinking water and an estimated million children cannot afford to go to school due to their lack of access to food and school supplies.\n\n\u201cVenezuela today has one of the best education systems in Latin America and the world, let us be proud!\u201d Maduro urged on state television Monday night. \u201cVenezuela is the only country in the world that gives boys and girls their backpack with supplies \u2026 their uniforms, that guarantees public education to 80 percent of people, free and of high quality!\u201d\n\nAny inability on the part of the government to provide basic services was the product of antagonism by the United States, he claimed.\n\n\u201cWe are here in a world war, of an economic character, with Imperialism [the United States] torturing the economic body of Venezuela,\u201d Maduro claimed. \u201cWe move forward.\u201d\n\nMaduro did not specify how the United States was engaging in a \u201cworld war\u201d by sanctioning only Venezuela for his regime\u2019s gross human rights abuses. He also did not make the link directly between American sanctions on high-ranking Maduro officials \u2013 not the Venezuelan people \u2013 and the destitute state of the Venezuelan education system. Despite Maduro\u2019s claims, the non-profit Save the Children explained last week:\n\nChildren\u2019s access to education is also in great peril. Many of the millions who have left are teachers leaving behind run-down schools and emptying classrooms as less and less people can afford to send their children to school, even if it is free. When inflation is at well over 1 million percent, the cost of notebooks and uniforms becomes a \u2018luxury\u2019 to dispense with. As more and more Venezuelans move to neighbouring countries, the burden on local schools increases while the same economic hardships facing these incoming Venezuelans means the financial barriers to children going to school remain high.\n\nMaduro moved on in his speech from education and \u201cworld war\u201d to celebrate what he claimed was an opening \u201cdialogue\u201d with the \u201copposition\u201d in the country. In reality, the individuals listed by Maduro\u2019s state news service as having participated in talks with his regime are all socialist, communist, or progressive groups, all of whom have ties to Maduro.\n\nAccording to VTV (state television), the participants in the \u201copposition\u201d \u201cdialogue\u201d included the parties \u201cMovement Towards Socialism,\u201d \u201cProgressive Alliance,\u201d and \u201cRed Flag,\u201d a Marxist-Leninist group. No representatives of the Venezuela right, to the extent that one exists, participated in talks with Maduro.\n\nThe leftist \u201copposition\u201d and Maduro signed an agreement that would allow the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), Maduro\u2019s party, to acquire seats in the National Assembly without having been voted in, which allows the PSUV to regain power over the only democratically elected branch of government left. The current National Assembly is run by a coalition of socialist opposition parties distinct from the socialists negotiating with Maduro today that won the majority in 2015.\n\nMaduro celebrated that the deal \u201copens all the doors towards dialogue for peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday we have signed a partial agreement with the majority of the Venezuelan opposition,\u201d Diosdado Cabello, a drug lord that Maduro has appointed to lead the PSUV, said on Monday. \u201cWe are totally in agreement with to reintegrate into the National Assembly \u2026 we will speak to the opposition as many times as necessary.\u201d\n\nMaduro has largely ignored the National Assembly since he lost it in 2015, when Cabello was speaker of the assembly. Cabello went on to establish an illegal extra-governmental legislature, the \u201cNational Constituent Assembly,\u201d to usurp power away from the rightfully elected lawmakers in the real legislature.\n\nNotably absent from talks with Maduro was the legal president of Venezuela, Juan Guaid\u00f3. Guaid\u00f3, a member of the democratic socialist Popular Will party, became president of the country in January after the National Assembly exercised its constitutional power to remove Maduro. Guaid\u00f3 has failed to consolidate any military power, however, leaving him only with the nominal title of head of state.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 entered talks with the regime, inexplicably brokered by the government of Norway, this year. The talks yielded no positive movement forward, as Maduro has refused to step down.\n\nFollowing the Maduro announcement this week that he had agreed to talks with the Marxist-Leninist \u201copposition\u201d instead of Guaid\u00f3, the president reiterated that he was open to talks, but only with \u201cpresidential elections as soon as possible with a new electoral council (CNE), without political prisoners, with \u2026 guarantees for all who participate in the process.\u201d\n\nTalks with the violently repressive Maduro regime are extremely unpopular among most Venezuelans. In the latest national poll by the data firm Megan\u00e1lisis, nearly 90 percent of respondents said they opposed talks between Maduro and the opposition. A similar number (89.5 percent) said they supported \u201cforeign military operations\u201d on Venezuelan soil to oust Maduro.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro told students in an address marking the first day of school Monday that their country was \"in a world war.\"", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1158326025-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
