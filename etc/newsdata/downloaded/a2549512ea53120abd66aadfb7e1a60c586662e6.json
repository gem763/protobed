CNN/Ben Westcott\n\nThe inconvenience and heightened security come in the lead-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, an important moment for the ruling Communist Party and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nTo celebrate, the Chinese government is holding a massive military parade through the center of Beijing -- about 15,000 personnel, more than 160 aircraft and 580 pieces of weaponry and equipment will take part.\n\nAuthorities have been working overtime to make sure nothing goes wrong ahead of the parade or during, and it isn't just local residents affected.\n\nEven tourists could see that Beijing is preparing for a major event.\n\n\"You clearly see the increase of the police everywhere,\" said Shanghai-based teacher Andre Pinto. \"We clearly can see the security level is up.\"\n\nAll along the central Chang'an Avenue, in both directions, black clad security guards with red arm bands stood every few feet for miles.\n\nChinese police block off a street corner in front of a military truck next to Tiananmen Square ahead of an overnight rehearsal on September 7.

On September 15, the Beijing Municipal government announced that all civilian flying objects would be banned until after the celebration.\n\nBut the bigger concern now is road and subway closures.\n\nA Chinese woman holds a national flag near a large screen set up for the 70th National Day celebrations as they visit Tiananmen Square on September 27.
