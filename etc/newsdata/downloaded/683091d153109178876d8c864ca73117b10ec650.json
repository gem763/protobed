That\u2019s enough to cover the 10 smallest state budgets, combined. But while economists broadly agree that most of this money is wasted, a combination of political pressure, big-money interests and bureaucratic inertia makes unrolling the entire economic development industry a gigantic challenge for reformers from across the political spectrum.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunately too much to ask for more than 540 state, local and regional economic development bureaucracies across America to close up shop and go find honest work tomorrow simply because the evidence shows that they\u2019re ineffective at best and harmful at worst. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect politicians to stop cutting tax credit deals so long as voters believe that they\u2019re \u201ccreating jobs\u201d by doing so. And we certainly know that companies will keep cashing incentive checks as long as we\u2019re willing to keep writing them.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have a starting point for cleaning up this toxic swamp of big business and big government interests. We can start small \u2013 if hundreds of millions of dollars is \u201csmall\u201d \u2013 by using simple common sense to end state subsidies for three especially toxic economic development sinkholes: Stadiums, data centers and distribution centers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhy these three? The common arguments in favor of incentives are that they create economic activity in an area, that they create jobs and that they change companies\u2019 decisions about where to locate. But stadiums don\u2019t create economic activity, data centers don\u2019t create jobs and distribution centers have to go where the customers are.\n\nStadiums don\u2019t create any meaningful economic impact for anyone other than the teams that play there, largely because they\u2019re empty and inactive far more often than they\u2019re not. Even a high-attendance MLB baseball stadium with 81 home games brings in fewer customers per year than a single mid-sized Walmart store that\u2019s open all day, every day. Yes, game days are great, but it\u2019s hard to build much local growth around something that\u2019s going to be empty for months at a time. The reality is that we subsidize sports teams because we love them, not because they\u2019re a good investment. And as anyone who\u2019s ever lent money to a family member can tell you, love is a poor reason to make a financial decision.\n\nStadiums are falling behind in \u201cbad economic development idea\u201d standings, though. The rise of cloud computing has created a demand for data centers, essentially large warehouse-like buildings near the telecommunications network \u201cbackbones\u201d of the Internet. They\u2019re full of expensive computers and industrial air conditioning that require massive amounts of electricity. While that makes them expensive to build and operate in terms of capital costs, they\u2019re terrible at \u201cjob creation\u201d because they simply don\u2019t employ many people to sit around watching lights blink on servers that are being remotely managed by programmers in Silicon Valley, India, China or elsewhere. Data center companies look for places that have the right network infrastructure, cheap energy, cheap land and few natural disasters. They then hit up governments for subsidies, and politicians who love to take credit with voters for \u201chigh-tech jobs\u201d gladly comply. In states like Iowa and Utah, the cost of some data center deals has reached $3 to $4 million per subsidized job.\n\nJust as e-commerce has created a need for data centers powering the websites where you do your shopping, it\u2019s also created a demand for distribution centers from which the drivers depart each day to deliver the products you ordered to your door. The more stuff you order and the quicker the retailer promises to get it to you, the closer they need to have that distribution center to your home. This makes state-level incentives to attract distribution centers pointless, as those facilities are going to be located where the customers are \u2014 and not where they aren\u2019t. An online retailer isn\u2019t going to put its distribution center someplace where it doesn\u2019t have customers to serve any more than a lumber company is going to set up a logging camp in the desert, no matter how big a tax incentive they\u2019re offered.\n\nStadiums, data centers and distribution centers aren\u2019t the only bad economic development deals out there. But if we want to stop draining money out of government budgets and burdening other taxpayers for no good reason, making those businesses pay their own way is a great place to start.\n\nJohn C.
