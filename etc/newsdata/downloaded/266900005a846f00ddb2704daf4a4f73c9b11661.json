But why?", "language": "en", "text": "Over the weekend, reports emerged that an Iran-backed Yemeni rebel group was responsible for a drone attack on an oil processing facility belonging to Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company. And as is his wont, Trump took to his Twitter account to decry reports that he was willing to meet with Iranian leaders.\n\nSpecifically, the president tweeted the following on Sunday:\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nDespite this, the media reports in question were, like most reports which Trump calls \"fake news\u201d, 100 per cent true.\n\nLast July, President Trump told members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars to not believe their eyes and ears when it comes to unflattering news stories about him and his administration. \"Don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2026What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, those of us who work in DC know that this weaponized term and its usage has very little relation to the truth. In fact, the phenomenon of stories being confirmed after Trump \u2014 or one of his spokespeople \u2014 denounces them as \"fake news\" has become so frequent that many White House reporters consider it a surefire sign that a story is accurate.\n\nSo it is with the latest developments between the United States and Iran.\n\nReports of Trump's desire to meet with representatives of the Islamic Republic first appeared in June, when during a trip to Switzerland, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters that the Trump administration was \"prepared to engage in a conversation [with Iran] with no preconditions.\u201d\n\nLater that month, Trump told NBC's Chuck Todd that there would be \"no preconditions\" to talks with Iran, a sentiment repeated a day later by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\nAccording to White House officials, Trump\u2019s willingness to meet with Iranian leaders had been a source of friction with his then-national security adviser, former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. The simmering tensions between the president and Bolton, a veteran Beltway operator known for his bushy mustache and bellicosity towards Iran, boiled over last week, leading to the latter's sudden departure from the administration last Tuesday.\n\nTrump claims that he fired Bolton over their differences of opinion, though Bolton disputed the president's account of their professional breakup and maintains that he offered to resign the night before Trump announced his departure.\n\nAmid media speculation over whether Bolton's departure could lead the Trump administration to take a less\u2026 Bolton-esque policy on Iran, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had a chance to put an end to what Trump would call \"fake news\" a mere five days later when he and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took to the White House briefing room on Tuesday.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
