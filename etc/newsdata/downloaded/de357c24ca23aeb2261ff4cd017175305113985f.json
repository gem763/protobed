Democrats allege that Trump may have abused the power of his office by asking Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter while withholding military aid.\n\nBut Trump has insisted he was justified in asking Ukraine to investigate corruption. His administration has denied a \"quid pro quo\" that aid would be released in exchange for the opening of investigations.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, told the House inquiry Thursday that Trump had directed diplomats to consult Giuliani on Ukraine policy.\n\nIn a July 25 call, Trump asked Zelensky to open an investigation into the Bidens, prompting an unnamed whistleblower to file a complaint alleging Trump used the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nMore:Mick Mulvaney acknowledges Trump held up aid to pressure Ukraine, then rows back\n\nMore:Impeachment inquiry: Trump ambassador 'disappointed' with Rudy Giuliani's influence in Ukraine policy\n\nIn text messages released as part of special envoy Kurt Volker's testimony, Taylor questioned whether military aid was being withheld for political reasons.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor asked in a Sept. 1 text message to Volker and Sondland.\n\n\"Call me,\" Sondland texted back.\n\nTaylor raised the issue again in a text Sept. 9. \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\" Taylor said.\n\nSondland said he called Trump before replying and then passed along the president's assurances. Trump had been \"crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind ... I suggest we stop the back and forth by text,\" Sondland said. He told Taylor to call \"S,\" presumably referring to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, if he wanted to discuss the matter further.\n\nAt an Oct. 17 news briefing, acting White house Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said aid to Ukraine was withheld in part because of Trump's desire for the country to investigate potential corruption regarding U.S. domestic politics.\n\nMulvaney later issued a statement saying his remarks had been misconstrued to \"advance a biased and political witch hunt.\"\n\n\"Let me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election,\" Mulvaney said in the statement. \"The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\"\n\nContributing: Deirdre Shesgreen, John Fritze, David Jackson", "description": "Taylor had raised concerns the withholding of\u00a0nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid until Ukraine delivered on Trump's demands.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/19/USAT/6af1c978-24b0-400c-a119-de9f6cbb7f03-EPA_UKRAINE_USA_JOHN_BOLTON_DIPLOMACY.JPG?crop=3374,1898,x0,y218&width=2732&height=1898&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
