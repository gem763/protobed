We have to do our job and score as many goals as we can and also keep a clean sheet.\u201d\n\nSaints lost Ryan Bertrand to an early red card and were shambolic in defense as they slipped into the relegation zone on goal difference after taking one home point this season.\n\nSouthampton\u2019s heaviest Premier League defeat had been a 7-1 reverse to Liverpool 20 years ago, another unwanted record for their under-pressure manager Ralph Hasenhuettl.\n\n\u201cIt was an embarrassing performance, the stuff of nightmares and especially playing at home,\u201d said Saints\u2019 forward Nathan Redmond.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t good enough and one of the poorest performances since I\u2019ve been at the club and we\u2019ll have to debrief that whole game from start to finish tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDOUBLE BLOW\n\nThere was a double blow for the hosts after 10 minutes when Chilwell tapped home a rebound to give Leicester the lead after Vardy\u2019s shot was only parried by goalkeeper Angus Gunn.\n\nA check by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) showed a crude lunge by Bertrand on Perez in the build-up to the goal and the Southampton defender received his marching orders.\n\nFrom there, Leicester were able to cut through their opponents at will.\n\nSaints defender Yan Valery could only steer a poor clearance into the path of Tielemans to score after 17 minutes and two minutes later the latter turned provider for Perez to open his Leicester account.\n\nHe grabbed his second with a volley at the back post from Chilwell\u2019s cross in the 39th, and the home humiliation was compounded when Vardy blasted past Gunn just before the break for a 5-0 lead.\n\nRampant Leicester added two more before the hour mark as Perez completed his hat-trick with a neat volley and Vardy was left unmarked to head home Chilwell\u2019s cross.\n\nMaddison added to the home misery with a 25-meter free-kick before Vardy completed his hat-trick with the last kick of the game via a penalty.\n\nIt was the biggest English top-flight win on the road since Wolverhampton Wanderers trounced Cardiff City 9-1 in the old First Division in 1955. Sunderland thrashed Newcastle United 9-1 away in 1908 while West Bromwich Albion beat Wolves 8-0 in 1893.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Leicester City recorded the biggest ever English top-flight away win by beating 10-man Southampton 9-0 at a rain-sodden St Mary\u2019s to move up to second place in the Premier League on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Licester-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
