It's often called Earth's twin because the planets are similar in size. But the modern comparisons stop there.\n\nHowever, a recent study compared five climate simulations of Venus' past and every scenario suggested that the planet could support liquid water and a temperate climate on its surface for at least three billion years. Like the other planets in our solar system, Venus formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nThose temperatures could have included a maximum of 122 degrees Fahrenheit and a minimum of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nBut between 700 and 750 million years ago, something triggered the release of carbon dioxide from rocks on the planet, transforming its climate.\n\nRead More", "description": "Venus likely maintained stable temperatures and hosted liquid water for billions of years before an event triggered drastic changes in the planet, according to a new study.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160812161549-venus-water-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
