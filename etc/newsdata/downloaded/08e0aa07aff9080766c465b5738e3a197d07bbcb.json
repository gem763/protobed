Had it not been seized near Spain, the journey would have been around 22,000km, according to shipping route website Sea Distances.\n\nThe much more ordinary route for such a journey would be via the Suez Canal in Egypt, which links the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.\n\n\n\nThat journey would have been just over 6,000km, according to Sea Distances, potentially saving the Grace 1 an extra 16,000km round Africa.\n\nThe route around Africa would also have taken almost 33 days, compared to nine days to travel via Suez Canal, Sea Distances calculated.\n\nThe distances involved are rough, as Business Insider does not have access to precise location data for the vessel.\n\nA likely reason for the odd route could be the lesser chance of being caught going the long way round.\n\nA maritime intelligence source told Reuters that the ship may have avoided the Suez Canal because that route involved unloading its cargo, where it would run the risk of being caught and seized.\n\nThis is what this route would have looked like:\n\nThe EU has banned oil shipments to Syria since 2011 as part of sanctions over President Bashar Assad's treatment of civilians.\n\nIran claims that its ship has been illegally detained, and summoned the UK ambassador. The UK central government and the US praised Gibraltar's action.\n\nReuters reported that it had seen shipping data that suggested the ship was loaded with oil in Iran, though the ship's documents say it was loaded in Iraq.\n\nThe ship was recently tracked in Iran's Bandar Assalyeh port, according to Reuters.\n\nAn analyst at Kpler, a London-based energy data firm, told Reuters that the ship loaded Iranian crude oil at Iran's Kharg Island port in mid-April.", "description": "Iran's tanker was seized in Gibraltar, where authorities say they had reason to believe that it was violating sanctions by bringing oil to Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9077/54ce559e6fff46d1b6583e5efc10477a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-05"}
