Meanwhile, S&P 500 is almost flat over a one-year period, while Bitcoin is up 21% from $6,600 in October 2018.\n\nLee noted that Bitcoin\u2019s average gain was 300% in the years when the S&P 500 was below its long-term average return. At the same time, in the years that have seen the index gaining 15% or more \u2014 BTC\u2019s average gain was 1,800%. Lee said:\n\n\u201cBitcoin\u2019s best years have all taken place in the years where the S&P has performed very well.\u201d", "description": "Crypto markets are slightly red today, with only 2 out of the top 20 coins by market cap seeing gains and BTC price dipping below $8,100", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9mNjdlNTI2MzMzMThkYzUyYTNmYjBlNzhlNWY5ZjAyOC5wbmc=.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
