The deal was cleared by agricultural commodities merchant ED&F Man. Following the block trade execution, XBTO stated:\n\n\u201cLast week, we bought the first Bakkt Bitcoin Daily Futures contract and took the first physical delivery of a digital asset under existing commodity futures laws and regulations. This week, we executed the first block trade. We\u2019re pleased to report that the launch was successful and can accommodate large trades.\u201d\n\nBlock trades are privately arranged futures or options transactions that can be executed separately from the public market. According to CME Group, block trades are often executed by large firms and institutions with particular purposes in mind.\n\nBakkt\u2019s anticipation and the initial reaction\n\nBakkt was launched on Sept. 23, after more than a year spent ensuring full compliance with United States authorities. In the first 24 hours, the Bakkt platform traded 71 Bitcoin futures contracts.\n\nBakkt failed to impress on the first day of trading purportedly due to the fact that the currency\u2019s price had been range-bound, so institutional traders were in no hurry to initiate positions. The day after launch, the Bitcoin price took its largest intraday hit since January, losing some 13% on Tuesday, Sept. 24.\n\nMati Greenspan, senior market analyst at digital asset trading platform eToro argued, \u201cThe catalyst for today\u2019s plunge, in my mind, seems to be the underwhelming launch of Bakkt. This is a prime example of \u2018buy the rumor, sell the news.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollowing the platform\u2019s rollout, Binance Research, Binance\u2019s analytics arm, released research wherein it singled out Bakkt as the principal event which occurred just before Bitcoin\u2019s price slip.", "description": "Intercontinental Exchange, the governing body behind the New York Stock Exchange, has executed the first block trade of Bakkt Bitcoin futures contract", "authors": ["Ana Alexandre"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvZGFjOWRlMzkzZDhiYmY3Yjk3Yjk3OTQyMThmM2NhODAuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
