Team officials said Williamson hurt his knee during the team\u2019s preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs last Sunday. Williams will earn an estimated $20 million for his rookie season.\n\nPost-surgery recovery will effectively cost Williamson as much as two months of his rookie season. The Pelicans begin their 2019-20 season on Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cZion Williamson underwent successful arthroscopic surgery today to address a torn right lateral meniscus. The routine debridement was performed by Dr. Jason Folk with assistance from Team Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Misty Suri,\u201d the Pelicans said in a press release. \u201cThe timetable for his full return to play is estimated at six to eight weeks.\u201d\n\nA standout player known for high-flying dunks during his one season at Duke University, Williamson was selected with the first overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. He signed a rookie contract worth up to $45 million.\n\nAside from delaying his pro debut, the injury marks a less-than-ideal start for Williamson\u2019s growing portfolio of corporate partners.

In college, Williamson missed multiple weeks with a right knee sprain after his Nike sneaker exploded during a game against the North Carolina Tar Heels.\n\nFormer Boston Celtics great Paul Pierce recently advised that Williamson, who stands 6-foot-6 and weighed 285 pounds in college, lose weight in order to preserve his knees from the rigors of the NBA.\n\n\"He\u2019s carrying so much weight, he\u2019s so athletic. I think he\u2019s going to have to lose a little bit more weight. That\u2019s one thing that happened to me \u2013 I had a bone bruise in my knee in my ninth year, and I decided to trim down, lose about 10 more pounds just to take that extra pressure off my knees. And it really helped,\" Pierce said on ESPN's \"The Jump.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWhile it\u2019s too early to say with Williamson\u2019s knee troubles will persist, he isn\u2019t the first much-hyped NBA prospect to enter the league with concerns about his durability.
