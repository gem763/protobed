And it looks like a split could be on the horizon as David will be left blaming her when Callum Logan\u2019s mum Marion fights for custody of Max Turner (Harry McDermott).\n\nWith David in prison, Shona has been trying to keep things afloat but Max\u2019s behaviour has been spiralling out of control. He has been lashing out at her and others and behaving badly, even getting excluded from school.\n\nHis actions have come as a result of both his turmoil over his dad being locked up and him stopping taking his ADHD medication so when Harry is injured as Max and Lily fight over the TV, Shona leaps to the conclusion that Max is to blame.\n\nHarry is knocked out and rushed to hospital and Shona rounds on Max, telling him off and causing him to storm out and stay with Marion, who he has been secretly visiting. Marion marches round to confront Shona and, seeing that she has been drinking, she brands her an unfit mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs she seeks legal advice from an oblivious Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) about getting custody, Shona feels bad when she learns that Lily was responsible for pushing Harry. But she and Max fail to make amends as he continues to stay with Marion, who makes it clear that Shona should expect to hear from a solicitor soon.\n\nShona is forced to visit David and tell him what has happened and that Marion is making a bid for custody of Max. With Shona having been accused of being unfit and David in prison, she could stand a chance of winning her case.\n\nAnd if David does find himself losing Max, he could well blame Shona. With Shona set to take an extended break from the show, will this be the catalyst for a heartbreaking split?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 18th October at 7:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "David is about to get bad news.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/16_10_coro_shona_max_sarah_1st_ep_01-b5c2_1570486720.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
