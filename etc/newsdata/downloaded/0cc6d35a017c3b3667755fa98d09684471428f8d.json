These characteristics are supposed to make the DF-17 impossible for American missile defenses, such as the THAAD system deployed in South Korea or Japan\u2019s upgraded defense network, to intercept.\n\nThe Global Times was much more explicit about portraying the DF-17 as a weapon specifically intended to penetrate U.S. defenses and implying the missile\u2019s prospective targets would be U.S. and allied bases in Asia.\n\nThe hardware on display in China\u2019s military parade included the submarine-launched JL-2 ballistic missile, the new generation of YJ-18 anti-ship missiles, and new surface-to-air missiles \u201ccapable of intercepting multiple air strike weapons in a complex electro-magnetic environment.\u201d", "description": "China\u2019s National Day military parade included the expected public debut of the advanced DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/China-DF-41-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
