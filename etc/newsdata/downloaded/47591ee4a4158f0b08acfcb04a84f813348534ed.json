Gantz has ruled out participating in an administration with Netanyahu, if the Israeli leader is indicted on looming corruption charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nSLIGHT DIFFERENCES\n\nThe two main parties' campaigns pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues: the regional struggle against Iran, the Palestinian conflict, relations with the United States and the economy.\n\nAn end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring about a significant change in policy on hotly disputed issues in the peace process with the Palestinians that collapsed five years ago.\n\nNetanyahu has announced his intention to annex the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinians seek statehood.\n\nBut Blue and White has also said it would strengthen Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank, with the Jordan Valley as Israel's \"eastern security border\".\n\nAs in the election five months ago, Netanyahu's opponents, including Gantz, focused on bribery and fraud allegations against the prime minister in three corruption cases. Netanyahu is due to face a pre-trial hearing in October to argue against the charges being filed.\n\nAn election loss could leave him more at risk of prosecution, without the shield of parliamentary immunity that his political allies had promised to seek for him.\n\nThere is no certainty they would stand by a weakened leader without an obvious public mandate in any coalition-building.\n\nNetanyahu portrays Gantz, 60, as inexperienced and incapable of commanding respect from world leaders such as U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nBefore the last election, Trump gave Netanyahu a lift with U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. This time, the White House seems more preoccupied with Iran.\n\nThe Trump administration plans soon to release an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan that may prove a dead letter: The Palestinians have rejected it in advance as biased.\n\nNetanyahu's open door in Washington and other world capitals, at a combustible time on Israel's borders with Syria, Gaza and Lebanon, remains a big draw domestically.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's battle for political survival looked set to stretch on after exit polls following Tuesday's election showed the race too close to call and Israel's longest-serving leader weakened.
