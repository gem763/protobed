Bernie Sanders, the Vermont Democratic Socialist and perennial government welfare recipient...I mean public servant...told a crowd of supporters on the 2020 campaign trail on Thursday that he would be open to new taxes on food, similar to European nations, in order to discourage Americans from buying meats and certain agricultural products.\n\nThe question came from a young woman in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. She said, \"So as you probably know animal agriculture is to blame for the majority of climate change and is the leading cause of deforestation water and air pollution and biodiversity loss with that being known what do you plan on doing to ensure that Americans limit their consumption of animal products?\n\n\"Second part,\" she continued, \"Germany has imposed a 'meat tax' in hopes of limiting this consumption. What are your plans to stop these large corporations from further usurping natural resources and polluting the planet? \"\n\nSanders responded by saying, \"Thank you for the question and it's a good question all I can say is if we believe as I do and you do that climate change is real we're gonna have to tackle it in every single area including agriculture, okay?\n\n\"And in fact, one of the things we want to do with our farmers out there is help them become more aggressive.\" he continued, \"and able to help us combat climate change rather than contribute to it. So we will certainly... you're right we got to look at agriculture. We've got to look at every cause of the crisis that we face.\"\n\nIncredible.
