(Photo: Ashley Kuzma via Facebook)\n\nAfter a two-year battle with laryngeal cancer, a beloved teacher in Pennsylvania has died. She leaves behind her loving parents, a sister, a community who adored her, and a heartfelt obituary she penned before her passing.\n\nAshley Ann Kuzma, of Conway, Pa., passed away on Sept. 22 at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, according to her online obituary. As one of the \"many preparations to make the transition easier on her family,\" she wrote her own obituary, which encouraged others to \"let go of the insignificant things and to just enjoy the people and places.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old McDowell Intermediate High School support teacher, who battled her cancer four times, admits that she had a lot of time \"to think about death,\" and was able to provide one final lesson with her self-written obituary, which included a dose of humor.\n\n\"When you have recurrent laryngeal cancer that just won't take no for an answer, you have a lot of time to think about death,\" Kuzma wrote. \"The good thing is I no longer have to worry about saving for retirement, paying off student loans, or trying not to get skin cancer.\"\n\nAccording to GoErie.com, Kuzma was diagnosed with cancer in June 2017 after she experienced chronic throat pain, which made her voice go hoarse. In Pittsburgh, Kuzma underwent 29 radiation treatments. While the tumors initially went away, they returned in February 2018. The following month, the educator underwent a partial laryngectomy and, despite still using a feeding tube, was able to return to school for the last days in June.\n\nIn August of that year, a scan showed she had cancer of the salivary glands. Kuzma received a total laryngectomy, with 30 more radiation treatments and five chemotherapy treatments.\n\nKuzma \u2014 who made news after winning a seven-day cruise as part of Norwegian Cruise Line's Giving Joy campaign, in which friends and thankful students nominated her \u2014 wanted to continue teaching. Despite the loss of her vocal cords, Kuzma could speak softly by utilizing the prosthesis that covered the opening in her neck from her surgery.\n\nIn March 2019, she learned her cancer had returned. According to GoErie.com, Kuzma said that, at this point, her options were limited.\n\nKuzma, who loved to travel \u2014 having visited London, Paris, Poland, Milan, Venice, Florence and Rome in the past \u2014 decided to take a trip to Mexico and saw Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, the Mayan ruins in Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.\n\nAlong with travel, Kuzma shared in her obituary that she enjoyed reading, cuddling with her cats, going wine tasting, cheering on the Steelers, and relaxing on her father's boat.\n\n\"I am extremely grateful for the life that I lived,\" Kuzma wrote. \"I was fortunate to have a loving family, supportive friends, a stable and meaningful job, and a house to call my own. My wish for you is to stop letting insignificant situations stress you out. Do what is important to you. Relax and enjoy the company of those around you. What do you value in your life? In the end, that's what matters.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "After a two-year-long battle with laryngeal cancer, a Pennsylvania teacher has passed away.
