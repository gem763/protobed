Amid a sea of squeaky supportive sneakers, she, in her scrubs-matching navy clogs, seemed to stride the linoleum floors just a bit more gracefully. The second time was a cornflower-blue pair belonging to a stylish lady heading into a Bed-Stuy Pilates studio. And the third, this time bright yellow, was on our regular waiter at Achilles Heel in Greenpoint.\n\nWhile most people associate nurse (and chef) footwear with hefty Danskos and blobby Crocs, Calzuro\u2019s slim silhouette aesthetically aligns more with a pair of No. 6 New School clogs. The slip-on manages to mold its satisfyingly chunky rubber into a somewhat dainty design. Made in Italy and created for surgeons, Calzuros \u2014 which are available in nearly 20 shades, including a near-crimson red, an Yves Klein\u2013esque blue, and a pine green, in addition to the more understated black and navy \u2014 have been around since the early \u201980s cultivating a solid and varied fan base. A quick search of #Calzuros will lead you into the delightful world of Nurse Instagram, though sprinkled within it are photos of non-nurses who still, more or less, stand for a living.\n\nA Connecticut cheesemaker\u2019s Calzuros. Photo: Brian Civitello\n\nAmong these people is Brian Civitello, a cheese-maker and the founder of Mystic Cheese Co. in Groton, Connecticut. He bought his first pair of Calzuros in the fall of 2013 on a work trip to Italy, where he noticed them on a fellow cheese-maker during a factory visit. Civitello has since purchased over 30 pairs for himself and his employees. He has them in multiple colors to match his factory\u2019s color-coding system, which helps him \u201ckeep track of good manufacturing practices.\u201d On any given day, Civitello says, he will change his shoes up to 20 times to avoid cross-contaminating the cheeses in different rooms of his factory. And he likes that the clogs are easy to hose down at the end of the week. \u201cI have put these shoes through some heavy-duty chemicals and haven\u2019t seen any discoloration or change to the rubber. It\u2019s impressive stuff. I still have the first pair I bought in the fall of 2013.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Sara Gates, owner of Kingsland Printing in Greenpoint, saw her first pair of Calzuros on a woman on the boardwalk in the Rockaways, where she lives. Shortly after, she spread the good word among her Rockaways beach crew, which includes Flannery Cronin, owner of Friend of All Glass; Abra Boero, owner of Off Season, and Jordan Woolf, who owns the boardwalk surf-and-turf stand High 97 \u2014 all of whom quickly purchased a pair.\n\n\u201cThey really are the perfect beach shoes,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThey\u2019re waterproof and breathable.\u201d But not until she wore them to her screen-printing studio in Greenpoint did she realize their full potential. \u201cThen my studio manager got a pair,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can stand in them all day \u2014 they\u2019re insanely comfortable.\u201d Another selling point, she adds, is that they\u2019re not Crocs, which she says lack support and just aren\u2019t attractive. \u201cI generally feel like this type of shoe is just too hideous for me, but for some reason, these are very aesthetically pleasing. They\u2019re the perfect height with the perfect amount of arch.\u201d\n\nThe clog that took over the Rockaways. Photo: Sara Gates\n\nWhen we spoke with Gates\u2019s friend Cronin, she told us that \u201cby the end of last summer, everyone at Rippers and on the boardwalk had these shoes,\u201d and \u201cnow in Greenpoint, everyone is walking around in their Calzuros.\u201d According to Cronin, Gates was \u201csort of like patient zero\u201d at the center of the Calzuros craze. Cronin has the clogs in dark metallic blue and purchased them for her employees because their jobs making stained glass are so physically demanding. For Cronin, who has suffered from back and foot pain for what she describes as a lifetime, getting a pair of Calzuros was life changing. \u201cEverything we do involves looking down or hunching over,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have pads on the floor and stuff to help, but nothing made that much of a difference until we got these shoes.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not all hip cheese-makers and Brooklyn glass artists: The original fans, the medical community, are still onboard. Michael Yuan, an oral and facial surgeon in Tampa, Florida, is enthusiastic about his pair. Like Cronin, Yuan found out about Calzuros by word of mouth. He\u2019d tried both Danskos and Crocs but then saw Calzuros on a few colleagues who swore by them. Yuan says Danskos are great for a specific fit, and Crocs are very comfortable but aren\u2019t that supportive. Calzuros, with their acupressure footbeds, are \u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d \u2014 he loves operating in them and can stand in them \u201cfor hours on end.\u201d\n\nCourtesy of @ Calzuro\n\nA little style and sizing info: You can choose between Calzuros with upper ventilation (a series of pin-size holes across the top of the clogs) or without, something to consider for rainy days or splashy factory settings. The clogs can come with straps, which you order separately for $8. And everyone we spoke to says they run a little big. We can vouch for this; sizing down a half-size is the sweet spot. This made our pair comfortable for gardening but still left a little room to wear with a pair of socks this fall, a look that\u2019s also perfectly fine for sitting at desks.\n\nCalzuro Heel Strap-Made in Italy Adding a heel-strap is an option \u2014 and real Calzuro-heads tend to mix and match colors. $8 at Amazon Buy $8 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
