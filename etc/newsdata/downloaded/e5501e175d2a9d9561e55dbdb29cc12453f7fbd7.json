As detainees staged riots inside the camp, militants targeted a vehicle belonging to the SDF in the vicinity of the camp on Sunday, killing and injuring a number of fighters. The ISIS propaganda channel Nashirnews via messaging app Telegram said on Monday that the \u201csoldiers of the caliphate\u201d targeted a vehicle of the \u201capostate,\u201d referring to SDF forces, with an improvised explosive device (IED) near the grain silo in al-Hol town killing and injuring those inside the vehicle. The SDF called on the international community to shoulder its responsibility by repatriating over 2,000 foreign fighters currently detained in northern Syria, but has received no answer. Dozens of children born to ISIS families have been taken back, but European countries appear to be unprepared to take responsibility for their adults.\n\nAccording to the report, ISIS is also \u201cconducting a sophisticated campaign of intimidation and assassination of individuals like heads of villages who are the eyes and ears of the SDF in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa provinces.\u201d The Kurdish media reported an Islamic State media statement claiming responsibility for one such political assassination in Deir ez-Zor.\n\nRudaw cited a Monday article in Foreign Policy that quoted two anonymous U.S. officials who said Turkey\u2019s Syrian allies are \u201cdeliberately releasing detainees affiliated with the Islamic State from unguarded prisons.\u201d\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Monday blamed Turkey\u2019s \u201cunacceptable incursion\u201d for undermining the \u201csuccessful multinational \u2018Defeat ISIS\u2019 mission in Syria\u201d and releasing \u201cmany dangerous ISIS detainees.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State has not been dormant since the fall of its \u201ccaliphate\u201d in Syria and Iraq. The terror gang launched over 250 attacks during the past year and still commands tens of thousands of fighters, many of them organized into \u201csleeper cells\u201d lurking in liberated territory. ISIS and its affiliates have also conducted terrorist attacks in other countries around the world.", "description": "ISIS is taking advantage of Turkey\u2019s invasion of Syria to increase the tempo of their own attacks on positions held by the Kurdish-led SDF.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/SDF-Syrian-Democratic-Forces-flag-GettyImages-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
