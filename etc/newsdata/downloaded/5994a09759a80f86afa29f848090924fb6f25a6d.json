(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nColumnist\n\nCorey Lewandowski has been alternately vulgar, pugilistic and deceitful. Now he wants to run for Senate.\n\nHe\u2019ll fit right in.\n\nThe one-time Trump 2016 campaign manager volunteered to appear before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, not to talk about presidential obstruction of justice \u2014 he happily obeyed White House orders not to discuss such matters \u2014 but to launch his bid for the Senate seat now held by the mild-mannered Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).\n\nLewandowski, now a TV commentator and consultant who trades on his influence with President Trump, used the hashtag \u201cSenate2020\u201d in a prehearing tweet promoting his appearance. He requested a five-minute recess in the hearing and used it to tweet: \u201cNew website just launched to help a potential Senate run. Sign up now!\u201d\n\nIf his testimony is any indication, he has already settled on a campaign theme: unbridled nastiness.\n\nHe rolled his eyes. He shook his head. He questioned Democrats\u2019 patriotism. He mocked former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s work: \u201cNobody\u2019s actually read the report.\u201d He made a crack about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and attacked \u201cbad\u201d and \u201cshameful\u201d federal agents, as well as \u201cTrump haters\u201d trying to \u201ctake down a duly elected president.\u201d He said \u201cthis fake Russia collusion narrative is the greatest crime committed against the American people in our generation, if not ever.\u201d When asked to read sections of the Mueller report by lawmakers, he refused. Instead, he doled out barbs:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me a question if you don\u2019t want to hear my answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cCould you repeat the question? I didn\u2019t hear it. It was just a rant.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike you sir, I don\u2019t live in town.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of anything in my life, congressman, are you?\u201d\n\nHe admitted he lied on TV about his and Trump\u2019s actions in the Russia probe: \u201cI have no obligation to be honest with the media.\u201d\n\nHis combative performance brought the House Judiciary Committee, never a harmonious assembly, to a new level of acrimony. Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.) repeatedly disrupted proceedings with howls for roll-call votes to cease questioning and to adjourn, dilatory interjections (\u201cThat was 19 seconds over!\u201d), parliamentary contretemps and an accusation that Democrats violated ethics rules. Democrats, riled, called Lewandowski a \u201cchicken,\u201d a \u201cForrest Gump\u201d of corruption, a \u201chit man,\u201d \u201cbag man\u201d and \u201clookout.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the good-looking man,\u201d Lewandowski rejoined.\n\nBack and forth lawmakers and witness went: Coverup. Socialists. Obstruction. Lie. Contempt. Fake news. Impeachment. Joe Biden\u2019s record player. Trump\u2019s Sharpie.\n\nRep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) proposed that \u201cthose on the other side of the aisle are useful idiots\u201d for Russia.\n\nAnother Trump ally, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), pointed out that House rules prevented him from disparaging Democrats\u2019 motives. So he asked Lewandowski to do so.\n\n\u201cThey hate this president more than they love their country,\u201d the witness replied.\n\nIt was a depressing scene, and quite a way to honor Constitution Day. Five hours of nastiness made clear that the revolting politics of this moment, though aggravated by Trump, are larger than him \u2014 and will outlast him if people such as Lewandowski gain election.\n\nLewandowski was charged with battery for grabbing a reporter during the 2016 campaign and lied about it until a video emerged to support the accusation; authorities called the evidence \u201clegally sufficient\u201d but dropped the charge. Singer Joy Villa, a Trump supporter, filed a sexual assault complaint against Lewandowski in 2017. (Lewandowski maintains his innocence.) He was charged with a misdemeanor in 1999 for bringing a gun into a congressional office building. Last year, he settled a dispute with neighbors accusing him of threatening them with a baseball bat. Under previous questioning by the House Intelligence Committee, Lewandowski said he wouldn\u2019t answer Democrats\u2019 \u201cf---ing\u201d questions.\n\nMueller\u2019s report recounts Trump dictating to Lewandowski a speech he wanted Attorney General Jeff Sessions to give directing the special counsel to stop investigating Trump. But Lewandowski, who claimed he didn\u2019t relay the instructions to Sessions because he took a \u201cvacation,\u201d refused to say anything more about the incident, instead reading and rereading to lawmakers a letter from White House lawyers (some seated behind him) directing him not to talk.\n\nMostly, Lewandowski, with buzz cut and extra-large flag lapel pin, campaigned for the Senate. He discussed his childhood, his time as a cop and his work shaping \u201cthe greatest political movement in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d He would later boast about his gun collection \u2014 kept in the same safe with Trump\u2019s proposed speech ending the investigation \u2014 and his support for the New England Patriots: \u201cTom\u2019s a winner!\u201d\n\nFrom Air Force One, Trump, who had already touted Lewandowski for the Senate, tweeted his approval: \u201cSuch a beautiful Opening Statement by Corey Lewandowski!\u201d\n\nLewandowski spoke about what he might do when serving \u201cin the other chamber.\u201d He told the lawmakers that \u201cmany people in New Hampshire\u201d have \u201cconfidence in me.\u201d\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) interrupted Lewandowski\u2019s taxpayer-funded campaign event.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not on the campaign trail yet,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the House Judiciary Committee. Act like you know the difference.\u201d\n\nThanks to the likes of Trump and Lewandowski, there no longer is a difference.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The House Judiciary Committee reaches a new low.", "authors": ["Dana Milbank", "Op-Ed Columnist Covering National Politics", "September At Pm", "Dana Milbank Is An Op-Ed Columnist.
