This state of affairs, they believe, is a \u201cmoral disaster.\u201d\n\nFor pedestrians pushed into the street by blocked sidewalks, women afraid of unruly men screaming obscenities, patio diners beset by panhandlers and homeowners discovering human feces in their yards, it\u2019s an environmental catastrophe \u2014 the neighborhood equivalent of an oil spill. They want someone to clean it up and prevent it from happening again.\n\nBoth are correct. Any serious attempt to address the crisis must take both problems seriously. Activists who ignore, downplay or stigmatize the threat to public order are hurting their own cause.\n\nThe compassionate view overwhelmingly dominates press coverage and official statements. It defines the problem and the acceptable ways of discussing it. Consider a New York Times report on President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Bay Area last month in which economics reporter Conor Dougherty editorialized:\n\nIn that light, local leaders have some real and reasonable doubts about how serious the president is about trying to solve homelessness. And Mr. Trump\u2019s own comments on homelessness did not offer much in the way of reassurance because he seemed less focused on the homeless than their apparent victims, like California\u2019s police officers \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re actually sick; they\u2019re going to the hospital\u201d \u2014 and property owners: \u201cWe can\u2019t let Los Angeles, San Francisco and numerous other cities destroy themselves.\u201d\n\nMost Californians in cities beset by homelessness would never vote for Trump, but he\u2019s voicing their disgust and unease. People who pay their taxes, keep up their homes and consider themselves law-abiding feel besieged and unheard. Whatever empathy they may have had melts away.\n\n\u201cThis is about people yelling and screaming at three in the morning and openly flashing weapons,\u201d a woman told the San Francisco Chronicle after neighbors pooled money for large boulders to keep homeless settlements off their sidewalks. \u201cI\u2019m not rich. I\u2019m having a hard enough time making it myself.\u201d\n\nPlaced in the \u201cfurniture zone\u201d next to the street, the boulders left room for pedestrians and complied with local codes. The public works department said they could stay. But pressure from enraged activists, who began rolling them into the streets at night, led residents to ask the city to haul the boulders away. \u201cWe traded criminals for activists and the media,\u201d one told the Chronicle. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel the fire anymore.\u201d\n\nIgnoring the public-order side of the issue has an ironic side effect. The chaos associated with homeless encampments appears to be fortifying a growing opposition to new housing intended to get people off the streets.\n\nIn November 2016, Los Angeles voters approved, by a 3-to-1 margin, a $1.2-billion bond measure to finance housing construction, mostly for the long-term homeless. After three years, the first building, with a mere 62 units, is scheduled to open in a couple of months. The city\u2019s strong Nimby culture \u2014 and the political tools available to halt new housing \u2014 extends to efforts to relieve homelessness.\n\nOpposition from local residents, including a lawsuit, has stymied a local nonprofit\u2019s plan to build a mixed-use complex with 140 housing units, artist lofts and retail space on city-owned parking lots in Venice. Outraged residents of L.A.\u2019s Koreatown neighborhood blocked a proposed homeless shelter there. My own neighbors in West L.A., where the sidewalks play host to a growing number of homeless campsites, are trying to rally opposition to a proposed 50-unit building on a city parking lot \u2014 but you have to read their website carefully to realize that's the agenda. The lawsuits and protests, and the resulting delays, typify the drawn-out process that makes housing of all kinds so expensive in the state.\n\nIn response, public officials seem to be coalescing around two new approaches. The first is to exempt new homeless housing from the much-abused California Environmental Quality Act, which provides the basis of not-in-my-backyard lawsuits. Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a law known as AB 1197 that would do that for the city of L.A. The law applies to housing financed by specific state and local sources, including the L.A. bond initiative. It will provide a good test to see just how big a factor the environmental law actually is in giving activists a way to delay new housing.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- California has a homelessness crisis, but Californians don\u2019t agree about what it is.To homeless advocates, social service providers, many politicians and most journalists, it\u2019s a humanitarian problem \u2014 a social tragedy of rapidly increasing numbers of men, women and families living", "authors": ["Virginia Postrel"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/NmnPiZ0cgCRLGx8xNE70WQ--~B/aD02NDg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_opinion_268/143734cf004ee38c254da9172bafcce8", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
