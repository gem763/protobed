When things are going good I'm in the background, but when the shit hits the fan then I'm the one who will show face and give direction.\"\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "Japan's rugby captain Michael Leitch has discovered a frustrating drawback to the side's storming World Cup run -- he can't pop out for a quiet coffee anymore.
