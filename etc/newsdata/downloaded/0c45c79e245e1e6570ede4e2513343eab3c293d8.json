There is still time to go back to Brussels and get a better deal.'\n\nThe PM will hit the phones to other European leaders today as he steps up the scramble to get a deal before a crunch summit on October 17.\n\nThe danger areas for Ireland after No Deal The No Deal 'war Cabinet' has identified a number of sensitive areas that could be used to increase pressure on Ireland in Brexit talks. They include: Some 60 per cent of the Republic's medicines come from the UK;\n\nOther crucial imports from the UK mainland could be hit by delays on Holyhead Bridge in Wales;\n\nIrish trawlers could lose fishing rights off the coast of Northern Ireland.\n\nMovement of horses between the Republic and the UK could be disrupted.\n\nBut he is facing a brick wall of resistance to his new Brexit blueprint, and French president Emmanuel Macron warned last night that he must make more concessions within days.\n\nThe document reportedly highlights the fact that 60 per cent of Irish medicines come from the UK.\n\nIt also raises the prospect of disruption to cross-border horse transport, the loss of fishing rights off Northern Ireland and the introduction of long customs checks on the Holyhead Bridge in North Wales, which links the ferryport with boats to Dublin with the UK mainland.\n\nFinnish prime minister Antti Rinne jibed that Mr Johnson had only just realised 'what a big mess this is'.\n\nAs the deadlock deepens, Downing Street is desperately hunting for ways around the Remainer rebel law ordering Mr Johnson to beg for an extension if an agreement is not in place by October 19.\n\nThere are claims the premier could take a case to the Supreme Court in a bid to avoid obeying the 'Surrender Act', even potentially giving evidence in person.\n\nCabinet ministers believe Mr Johnson must at least go down fighting, or the Tories could be eaten alive by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party at the looming election.\n\nThe PM will hit the phones to other European leaders today as he steps up the scramble to get a deal before a crunch summit on October 17\n\n\n\n", "description": "Michael Gove's Brexit operations committee drew up the document warning of a shortage of medicines, customs delays at the Northern Ireland border and a loss of access to fishing grounds.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19392206-0-image-a-12_1570446206225.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
