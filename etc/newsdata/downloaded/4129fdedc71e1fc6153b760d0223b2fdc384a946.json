Beneath a photo of celebrating jihadists, the headline read: \u2018Jubilant ISIS Prisoners Hail American Liberators\u2019.\n\nAlso on rt.com Trump lifts Turkey sanctions as he claims ALL credit for Syria border de-escalation\n\nUnfortunately, that media outlet was the satirical website The Onion, but it did reflect one sobering fact, that if the consequences for the Kurdish people of the US withdrawal were not so devastating, then the whole episode, including Trump\u2019s self-congratulatory \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d tweet would be utterly hilarious.\n\nFurther to this, Trump has announced today that his moves were responsible for \u201csaving\u201d the Kurds at the same time as the US Treasury announced it was dropping sanctions it had imposed on Turks following their offensive.\n\nMeanwhile fears that the Kurds would open ISIS prisons allowing hundreds of jihadists to flee proved to be unfounded, the \u201csheer insanity\u201d \u2013 as one Canadian politician termed the tweets \u2013 continued with the US President today declaring that the, \u201cKurds are safe and have worked nicely with us.\u201d\n\nThe hypocrisy is jaw-dropping. Remember, these are the local partners the US has been allied with during this Syrian saga and lost an estimated 11,000 soldiers fighting ISIS under American direction.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018America is running away\u2019: Irate Kurds pelt withdrawing US forces with vegetables (VIDEO)\n\nTrump\u2019s claim echoes his earlier tweet when he suggested the immediate result of the American withdrawal was: \u201cThe Kurds are much safer right now, but the Kurds know how to fight. And as I said they\u2019re not angels, they\u2019re not angels.\u201d\n\nSo, POTUS is claiming that abandoning the Kurds and paving the way for a Turkish offensive on the hard-fought territory they were defending somehow made them \u201csafe\u201d?\n\nBeing \u201csafe\u201d meant that tens of thousands of people were displaced in a matter of a few days, dozens of civilians were killed.\n\nThat\u2019s like taking your children to the zoo and putting them inside the lion enclosure believing them to be safer than outside. It doesn\u2019t make any sense no matter which way you look at it.\n\nBut to The Donald, it all makes sense, somehow. He tweeted today: \u201cBig success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Ditch the Kurds, grab the oil? Trump says US \u2018never committed\u2019 to Syrian allies, but SecDef says Washington still committed to oil\n\nMaybe those combat missions have ended for Turkey and Syria, but the Kurds who were previously resident as recently as two weeks ago in the aforementioned \u201cSafe Zone\u201d might disagree. To them, Donald\u2019s \u201cSafe Zone\u201d is actually home.\n\nAs for the US troops, they were last seen crossing the Iraq border where they were greeted by local Kurdish civilians with a barrage of rotten fruit and insults.\n\nMeanwhile, the base that they had abandoned at Manjib, Syria, was being pored over by curious Russian troops, allies of the Syrian Army, who had the video including images of fridges stocked with Coca Cola, mockingly posted online.\n\nCould anyone ever make this stuff up?\n\nBy Damian Wilson, UK journalist & political communications specialist\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
