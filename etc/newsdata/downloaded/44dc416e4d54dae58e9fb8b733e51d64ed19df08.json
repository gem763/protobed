United\u2019s season ends with extra-time collapse in MLS playoffs", "language": "en", "text": "As quickly as the outlook brightened, however, it unraveled in rapid and horrific style. Toronto scored four goals before the 30-minute bonus period was halfway done and coasted to a 5-1 victory at BMO Field.\n\nRooney, who in August announced he would return to England a year earlier than planned, finished his United term watching the last 15 minutes of extra time from the bench. The outcome had been settled.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHe had scored just once since July 1, missing several matches along the way, but there was no denying his contributions, on and off the field.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfortunate way for him to finish here,\u201d Coach Ben Olsen said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he would have wanted to hit the back of the net and push us into the next round.\u201d\n\nFor the second consecutive autumn, his season slipped away in the opening round of the postseason. Both times, elimination came after the standard 90 minutes.\n\nRooney left the locker room without speaking to reporters, heading to the team charter back to Washington before a trip home to join second-flight Derby County as a player and assistant coach.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe turned our team around completely,\u201d defender Steven Birnbaum said. \u201cHe has just been a great presence for us. We\u2019ve been lucky to have him.\u201d\n\nRooney did have three outstanding chances to score in the second half \u2014 Ola Kamara had one as well \u2014 but United did not pull even until Lucas Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s shocking goal in stoppage time.\n\nAD\n\nToronto had gone ahead in the 32nd minute when Marco Delgado capitalized on goalkeeper Bill Hamid\u2019s error and scored from close range.\n\nWith time melting away, though, Rooney served a corner kick. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brillant won the header. Paul Arriola\u2019s stab was unsuccessful. On the back side, Rodr\u00edguez knocked it in, silencing an announced crowd of 25,331 that was preparing to party.\n\nAD\n\nUnited\u2019s optimism did not last long. Three minutes into extra time, substitute Richie Laryea beat Hamid from a tight angle. Two minutes later, Jonathan Osorio tapped in from the doorstep. Osorio scored on a sublime one-timer from the top of the box in the 103rd minute, and former United player Nick DeLeon added a sensational goal before the extra-time break.\n\nUnited allowed more goals in that stretch than in the previous six matches combined.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou go out with a lot of momentum,\u201d Arriola said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we give up a goal so early\u201d in extra time.\n\nHaving thrown so many attacking players into the effort to tie it, United did not have the proper personnel to carry it through another 30 minutes.\n\nAD\n\nNonetheless, Olsen said: \u201cWe\u2019re pros. We should have a better mentality and make better plays.\u201d\n\nUnited, the No. 5 seed, has not won a playoff game since 2015. Fourth-seeded Toronto advanced to play at New York City FC on Wednesday in a conference semifinal.\n\nUnited conceded possession in the first half. When D.C. did claim the ball, it did not do much with it. Connections were off, the buildup was slow, and four corner kicks did not yield any serious threats.\n\nToronto went ahead when Hamid failed to properly handle Alejandro Pozuelo\u2019s 25-yard bid. A finalist for MLS goalkeeper of the year and the co-leader in shutouts, Hamid has made few mistakes this season. And given Hamid\u2019s vast experience, United did not expect him, of all players, to slip up.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut on this sequence, with the shot skipping toward him, he neither corralled it nor pushed it wide. Instead, he knocked the ball forward, leaving it in the danger zone for Delgado to snap into the net from six yards.\n\nThe goal ended United\u2019s shutout streak at 536 minutes, the longest in the league this year.\n\nUnited\u2019s problems intensified late in the first half when Felipe Martins, whose summer arrival and hearty contributions altered the midfield dynamic, departed with a groin injury. He walked off the field slowly, his shirt pulled over his face to hide his emotions. Olsen consoled him with a hug.\n\nFacing a deficit, Olsen changed the look instead of making a straight-up switch. He inserted Kamara and made a series of positional moves.\n\nAD\n\nAfter intermission, Toronto continued to set the terms, pushing for the backbreaking goal.\n\nAD\n\nAt the other end, Quentin Westberg made three consecutive saves on Rooney. Later, Kamara had a one-on-one but failed to beat Westberg, who used his hip to deflect what should have been the equalizer.\n\nHope was running out before Rodr\u00edguez forced extra time \u2014 a 30-minute reprieve that turned into a Canadian nightmare for United.\n\n\u201cWe just got punched in the face,\u201d Birnbaum said. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating.\u201d\n\nAnd with it, Rooney marked his short-lived stay in MLS.\n\n\u201cHe gave a lot to the organization,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cFrom a team standpoint, on the field, some wonderful moments. He was a great teammate. He was good to our fans and appreciative of the support. It was a joy to work with him.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "After a dramatic equalizer extends the game, United concedes four goals in extra time in a 5-1 loss to Toronto FC.", "authors": ["Steven Goff", "Reporter Covering Soccer", "D.C.
