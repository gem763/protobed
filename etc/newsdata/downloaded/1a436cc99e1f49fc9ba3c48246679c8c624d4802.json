Twenty-eight of the 68 women dropped out, 30 runners were given medical inspections and one was briefly hospitalized.\n\n\"It was a mistake to conduct the championship in such hot weather in Doha, especially the marathon race. As someone who has been in the sport for many years, I've found it unacceptable,\" former marathon world-record holder Gebrselassie told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.\n\nHaile Gebrselassie.

That could hurt their morale for the future, he added.\n\nAll three of Ethiopia's runners failed to finish the women's marathon, which was won by Ruth Chepngetich of Kenya.

In the men's 50-kilometre walk Sunday, 15 of 46 starters dropped out, and six out of 23 were non-finishers in the women's 50k walk.\n\nThe IAAF has defended its staging of the events, saying that the women's marathon completion rate was similar to those at world championships in Tokyo (1991) and Moscow (2013).\n\nNext year's Olympic marathons in Tokyo are scheduled to start at 6 a.m., and runners can expect to face similar intense heat.", "description": "Distance-running great Haile Gebrselassie says it was a mistake to hold the track and field world championships in Qatar and that marathon runners could have died from the heat.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5302591.1569852581!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/1177851072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
