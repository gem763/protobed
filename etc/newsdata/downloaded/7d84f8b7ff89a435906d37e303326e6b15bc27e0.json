Aside from Five Nudes, all of the other six compositions depict either a pair or single figures.\n\nFive Nudes also features two other examples of Sanyu\u2019s signature motifs: animals and flowers. While the female figures are standing on a bold yellow carpet with flower designs, cats can be seen playing at their feet.\n\nSanyu, also known as Chang Yu, was regarded as \u201cthe Chinese Matisse. \u201d He was born in China in 1901 and moved to Paris to study at the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in 1921. He never returned to China, and died in Paris in 1966 at age 64.", "description": "The current auction record for the Chinese-French artist is HK$198 million, with the sale of his \u2018Nude\u2019 earlier this month", "authors": ["Fang Block"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-118058/social", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
