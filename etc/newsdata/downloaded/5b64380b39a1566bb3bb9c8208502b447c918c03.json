Barr on potential corruption investigations connected to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Democratic rival.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump sought to present a business-as-usual image in his annual trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly \u2014 by highlighting a trade deal with Japan, among other things \u2014 his anger and anxiousness took over his day, aides said. He appeared aggrieved in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, but by late afternoon, Mr. Trump appeared so exhausted that he spoke unusually slowly at a rambling news conference meant to sum up his trip at the United Nations.\n\nHe opened by naming 28 countries whose leaders he had met with and said that unfortunately reporters were far more interested in his phone call with Mr. Zelensky. \u201cI\u2019ve been up from early in the morning until late in the evening and meeting with different countries, all for the good of our country.,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd the press doesn\u2019t even cover all of this.\u201d\n\nThen he moved on to the call, and the words he said spoke to the Ukrainian president.\n\n\u201cThey were perfect,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThey were all perfect.\u201d", "description": "On Wednesday the president\u2019s mood went from angry to aggrieved to self-pitying as he fended off questions about a phone call with the Ukrainian president.", "authors": ["Maggie Haberman", "Michael Crowley", "Katie Rogers"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/us/politics/25dc-call1-sub2/25dc-impeach-briefing-live-video-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
