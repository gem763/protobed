But this is temporary and the market will pick up towards the end of the day,\" said a trader in Riyadh, who asked not to be identified.\n\nSaudi Basic Industries (SE: ), the kingdom's biggest petrochemicals firm, was down 3.3% after it said it had curtailed feedback supplies by about 49% following the attack.\n\nOther petrochemical companies such as Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co (SE: ) and Kayan (SE: ) also announced significant reductions in feedstock supplies.\n\nThe attacks come at a bad time for Saudi Arabia, which is preparing for the listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco on the Tadawul bourse in Riyadh later this year.\n\nThe attacks are unlikely to change plans for Aramco\u2019s long-awaited initial public offering but may affect the valuation, risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in a note.\n\n\"The latest attack on Aramco facilities will have only a limited impact on interest in Aramco shares as the first stage of the IPO will be local. The international component of the sale would be more sensitive to geopolitical risks,\" it said.\n\nAramco has hired nine banks as joint global coordinators to lead its IPO, slated to be the world's largest, Reuters reported, citing two sources.", "description": "Saudi, Gulf stocks fall after attack on Aramco oil plants", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8E03R_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
