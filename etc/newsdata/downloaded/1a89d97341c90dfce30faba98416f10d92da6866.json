If you hate Khabib and his team, why do you say bad things about [all Dagestani] people?'\n\nThe Dubliner remained calm and tried to reason that his comments were made off the back of slurs from people in his rival Khabib Nurmagomedov's homeland.\n\n'The disrespect they showed me in the build up to the fight, they sold items in the grocery [store] with my face on it,' he said, referring to a Dagestani supermarket labelling frozen chickens with his name.\n\nThe enraged man retorted: 'All the people? My father, my brother, you think are all cowards?' to which McGregor continually replied: 'Yes'.\n\nMcGregor remained calm and said the comments were a response to slurs from Dagestan\n\nThis week, the Irishman vowed to 'go through the entire roster like a chainsaw through butter'\n\n'Why cowards? My father?! What did he do to you?! My brother, what did he do to you?!', the fiercely patriotic man responded before hurling a bottle and being ushered away by security.\n\nThe 31-year-old fighter wasn't flustered and continued to take questions around his return to the UFC.\n\nThe Irishman will be fighting in Las Vegas in January next year. He has not stepped into the cage since losing to Khabib in the same location last October.\n\nIn the same Thursday presser in which he spoke provocatively about Dagestan, the 'Notorious' said: 'I am going to go through the entire roster like a chainsaw through butter.'\n\nA rematch with Khabib, who has since defended the lightweight title against Dustin Poirier, is expected to be made at some point.\n\nMcGregor has not stepped into the cage since losing to Khabib Nurmagomedov last year\n\nAnd McGregor took aim at his bitter rival. 'It will happen. I am not waiting around for that man, he is a known pull-out,' he added.\n\n'You can run but you cannot hide. He ran out of the press conference in Moscow last week. It is in his nature. Trust me I am coming for him.\n\n'Where is he now in this country? I fly in, he flies out. Typical.'\n\nDagestan is a federal subject of Russia, located in the North Caucasus region that borders Georgia, Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea to the east.\n\nIts nationals are fiercely patriotic and see themselves as separate from Russia.", "description": "In Moscow on Thursday McGregor said: 'I wouldn't go to Dagestan to take a s**t, and that is the truth' leading a man from the Russian district to launch a bottle at the Irishman in anger on Friday.", "authors": ["Leigh Mcmanus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/16/20218838-0-image-a-30_1572102374076.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
