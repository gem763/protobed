REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed\n\nWith formal results yet to be announced, conservative law professor Kais Saied and detained media magnate Nabil Karoui cited exit polls late on Sunday to say they had advanced to a deciding run-off that will be held next month.\n\nIf confirmed by official results later on Monday or on Tuesday, it would represent a strong rejection of successive governments that have struggled to improve living standards or end corruption.\n\nSaied described the exit poll results, which showed him with most votes, as \u201clike a new revolution\u201d in a radio interview, a reference to Tunisia\u2019s 2011 uprising that brought in democracy and set off the Arab Spring revolts elsewhere.\n\nTunisia\u2019s prime minister, two former prime ministers, the defence minister and a former president were among the political heavyweights competing, as was a candidate of the moderate Islamist Ennahda party.\n\n\u201cWe received the message sent by the Tunisian people,\u201d Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said late on Sunday, conceding defeat.\n\nBanned before the revolution and once seen as the main anti-establishment force in Tunisia, Ennahda has been a big player in successive coalition governments caught between the public desire for more spending and a need to reduce debt.\n\nWith a low turnout of 45% - down from 63% in 2014 - the result underscored widespread frustration over the sluggish economy, high unemployment, poor public services and persistent corruption.\n\nKaroui, in a message read by his wife after the exit polls were published, said it was a message to a political elite that he accuses of using the judicial process to try to silence him.\n\nHe was detained weeks before the election over allegations of tax evasion and money laundering made three years ago by a transparency watchdog.\n\n\u201cYou punished those who tried to steal the votes by putting me in prison without trial, and who prevented me from speaking to people in the campaign,\u201d his message said.", "description": "Two political outsiders appear to have stunned Tunisia's political establishment, claiming victory after Sunday's first round of a presidential election.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430405823&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F0MT-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
