AFP/Getty Images\n\nWe live in a world where there are now many words to describe one\u2019s relationship that are conveniently non-committal and also, somewhat meaningless.\n\nBut if after a few months the person you\u2019re dating/seeing/snogging/pulling/spooning refuses to label it (i.e. call you their girlfriend or boyfriend), it could be a major red flag.\n\nNot only might it signal a lack of commitment, explains Mason Roantree, but it may also suggest they are romantically involved with someone else.\n\n\u201cIf your significant other seems to avoid any conversations about exclusivity and labels after dating for several months, they are probably not serious about the relationship,\u201d she tells The Independent.\n\nYou don\u2019t feature on their social media accounts after a few months\n\nThis is niche and should come with a disclaimer: if you or your partner are not on social media, or you use Instagram solely to follow cat fan accounts, you can probably ignore the following.\n\nBut if you are someone whose partner scrolls through Instagram/Twitter/Facebook religiously and has a history of featuring exes on their profile, Mason Roantree says it might be bad news if they haven\u2019t posted about you yet.\n\n\u201cIt might mean they don\u2019t see you as a long-term option, or that they are not ready to show you to the world,\" she explains.\n\nThe one exception? If it\u2019s a business account. In that case, not wanting to post selfies of you both in front of the Eiffel Tower complete with love-heart emojis and #CoupleGoals is kind of fair enough.\n\nThey never initiate dates\n\nIt might sound simple, but actually sticking one\u2019s neck out to make a plan is pretty important when it comes to dating, says Mason Roantree.\n\n\u201cIf you always seem to suggest when to meet, this is a one-sided relationship,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt requires you to do all the work.\n\n\"Someone who is really into you will contribute and be proactive in the relationship.\u201d\n\nBeing proactive is attractive, sitting back and letting someone else do all of the legwork while you bask in the glory of not having to lift a finger is not.\n\nThere\u2019s a power imbalance\n\nDating is about working together to support one another in equal measure, says dating coach James Preece. Being in a happy relationship should feel like being in the best kind of team, he says. If it doesn\u2019t, and it seems like one of you is constantly exerting control over the other, who is more submissive, consider it a bright red flag, he tells The Independent.\n\n\u201cSigns of a power imbalance can take the form of jealousy or controlling behaviour,\u201d he explains. \u201cBoth can easily lead to the end of a relationship, so try to deal with this early on rather than bottling up emotions.\u201d\n\nAs for how to handle it, Preece advises making your concerns clear and if nothing changes, it's time to reevaluate.\n\nYou express your feelings to one another differently\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing to have a yin and yang balance in a relationship: what you lack, your partner provides and vice versa. But one instance when this could be concerning is when it applies to how you express your love and affection for one another.\n\nIt could be that you\u2019re more of a romantic wordsmith \u2013 you constantly tell your partner you adore them and inundate them with compliments \u2013 while your partner is less appreciative of effusive compliments and favours kind-hearted actions.\n\nThe tricky thing is that if you\u2019re one way inclined, it may lead you to expect the same kind of behaviour from your partner, and when you don\u2019t receive it, it can be disappointing, explains Preece.\n\n\u201cIf you expect one thing and get another, you might not be as compatible as you hoped,\u201d he adds.\n\nOne of you is keeping secrets\n\nWe\u2019re not just talking about harbouring a penchant for pineapples dipped in marmite. If you or your partner is hiding something from the other, it\u2019s going to do inevitable damage to your relationship at some point and is a definite red flag, says Preece.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to share every little thought with our partner. But if one of you has something major on their mind that they are hiding, then it\u2019s going to be problematic because keeping secrets can interfere with your happiness and the idea of getting \u2018discovered\u2019 can cause paranoia and arguments.\u201d\n\nRecent research by dating website Elite Singles found that 34 per cent of people think sharing secrets is an important part of forming an intimate bond, so there are benefits to being an open book too.\n\nThey won\u2019t compromise\n\nYou\u2019re never going to agree on everything with your partner, that much is a given. For example, a recent study found that nearly one in 10 couples split during house renovations with 15 per cent claiming they were \u201cconstantly at each other\u2019s throats\u201d.\n\nBut learning to find a middle ground and ways to compromise on key issues is hugely important for a relationship to thrive, Preece explains.\n\n\u201cCompromise really is all about not standing your ground and keeping the peace,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about looking for the halfway point where both parties can be happy. They\u2019re not thrilled, but they\u2019re not disappointed either.\u201d\n\nIf you notice that you and your partner are having an almost impossible time compromising, perhaps one of you refuses to budge on a particular issue, then there may be something very \u201cseriously wrong with your relationship,\u201d Preece adds.\n\nYour friends or family hate them\n\nIf the people who know you the best do not like your partner, it\u2019s an obvious red flag, says Preece.\n\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s easy to get blinkered and only see what you want to see, but if your family or friends clearly don\u2019t like your partner then you need to understand why.\u201d\n\nOf course, not everything can be happy families and some people simply don\u2019t get on. But if you start to hear more negativity from your friends and family members, you may want to reevaluate your relationship.\n\nPreece adds: \u201cThose around you can often see things you never will.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published on 2 April 2019\n\nThe Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships.
