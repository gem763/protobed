We have a lot of players of different ethnicities and skin colour. I don\u2019t think we have as a big a problem like, for example, England do.\n\n\u201cIn the Bulgarian championship we have not had such problems while there have been incidents in all levels of English football involving racism.\u201d\n\nDespite the incidents that led to the stadium\u2019s partial closure, Balakov is confident they will not be repeated on Monday evening, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not an issue that has happened recently at the national team games and I would like the game to be a celebration of football.\n\n\u201cMy personal opinion is I can never be certain of what will happen - I\u2019m not often certain about what will happen on the pitch even - but I do not think we should continue talking about something that has not even happened yet and increase the tension in the build-up to the game.\n\n\u201cI will ask everyone to respect the rules in order for everyone to enjoy the game.\u201d\n\n(Image: EMPICS Sport)\n\nBalakov was flanked by one of Bulgaria\u2019s black players and defender Georgi Pashov added: \u201cI\u2019ve spent almost all of my career in the Bulgarian Championship and I do not recall any problems or racist chants.\u201d\n\nOn the field, there has been little cause for Bulgarian fans, Pashov or Balakov to celebrate for a good while, the team currently on a run of ten games without a win.\n\nAnd Balakov, who took over the reins in May, did not sound overly confident of causing an even bigger upset than the Czechs conjured up on Friday.\n\nHe said: \u201cEvery time a new coach comes in he has different philosophies and I have only had six combined days to work with these players over the last few months and we cannot change that much in this short period of time.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s happy with the results and we have to be realistic about it - we are playing one of the best teams in the world, one of the most dynamic tams in the world.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\u201cAnd although we are playing at home, we have to have in mind the quality of England.\n\n\u201cBut I want an attractive game and if, like in 1993, God is with is, we will get a result.\u201d\n\nBalakov was referring to the dramatic late win in the Parc de Princes that earned Bulgaria place at World Cup \u201994 and knocked France out.\n\nBut that was the Bulgaria of Hristo Stoichkov and there should be no-one like that to trouble England in Sofia.", "description": "England's players have threatened to walk off the pitch if they hear abuse during Monday's game", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Getty Images", "Empics Sport", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20572337.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bulgaria-Training-Session-and-Press-Conference-The-National-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
