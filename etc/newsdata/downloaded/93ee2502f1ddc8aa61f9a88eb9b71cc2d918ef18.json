Johnson just lost his slender parliamentary majority, and the prospect of a new election still looms.\n\nIf things break the wrong way, the winner could be opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, a throwback leftist redolent of the bad old days of Britain\u2019s self-imposed stagnation.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to exaggerate the threat represented by Corbyn & Co. taking control of our most important ally. In US terms, Corbyn is a mashup of Bernie Sanders and the Squad, mixing orthodox socialist economics with a hostility to US foreign policy and Israel.\n\nHe is a lefty caricature. George Orwell once complained of \u201cthe smell of crankishness\u201d in the socialist movement and wished he could send every vegetarian and teetotaler home \u201cto do his yoga exercises quietly.\u201d\n\nCorbyn is, indeed, a vegetarian who rarely drinks. One British newspaper relates that his favorite restaurant is a spot \u201cwhere he likes to eat hummus after taking part in demonstrations in Trafalgar Square.\u201d His first wife reports that he never took her out to dinner, preferring to eat beans straight from a can to save time.\n\nHe is a figure that time is supposed to have forgotten. He inveighed from the back benches against Labour\u2019s turn away from the old-time religion under moderate Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nWhen he mounted an unlikely leadership bid in 2015, he found an audience, much as Bernie Sanders did in 2016. Now the old-time religion is a few lucky breaks away from power.\n\nCorbyn\u2019s past, and present, is littered with valentines to left-wing thugs. He cozied up to the IRA in the 1980s when it was trying to decapitate the British government by bombing. He wrote for a pro-Soviet newspaper during the Cold War.\n\nHe called the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u201cnot unprovoked.\u201d He\u2019s said warm things about Hamas and Hezbollah, and can\u2019t bear to condemn Islamic terrorism without also criticizing the West.\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that his Labour party has become lousy with anti-Semites.\n\nHis left-hand man, John McDonnell, shadow chancellor of the exchequer, is fond of implicit threats of violence. To wit, \u201cAny institution or any individual that attacks our class, we will come for you with direct action.\u201d He has called Tory MPs \u201csocial criminals.\u201d This from the man in line to become, in our terms, secretary of the treasury of one of the great banking centers on the planet.\n\nsee also Boris Johnson loses bid for new election amid Brexit defeats British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday was denied a...\n\nIf McDonnell\u2019s style of rhetoric has a grim revolutionary cast, it\u2019s for good reason. In an interview with \u2014 no joke \u2014 the Trotskyist Alliance for Workers\u2019 Liberty years ago, he said that the most important influences on him were \u201cMarx, Lenin and Trotsky, basically.\u201d\n\nCorbyn has expressed similar sentiments, for example calling Karl Marx \u201ca fascinating figure,\u201d one \u201cfrom whom we can learn a great deal.\u201d\n\nAt least they don\u2019t leave any doubt where they are coming from. If Corbyn had his way, it would be as if Margaret Thatcher had never happened (indeed, McDonnell has mused about going back to the 1980s to assassinate her \u2014 you know, the way many people do about Adolf Hitler).\n\nCorbyn\u2019s program would renationalize sectors of the economy, punish shareholders and landlords and impose stiff new taxes. If his campaign against capital crashed the pound, he\u2019d surely be inclined to respond with capital controls, truly taking Britain back to the 1970s.\n\nEvery election in a democratic society is important. But Britain in the coming weeks will be faced with unquestionably momentous choices: Whether to take back its full sovereignty from the EU, and whether to throw in with a dangerous radical.\n\nIts modern history, and perhaps that of the West, is in the balance.\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry", "description": "He is a figure that time is supposed to have forgotten.
