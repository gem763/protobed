Unlike other lawsuits against Equifax, these don\u2019t come from wronged consumers, but rather shareholders that allege the company didn\u2019t adequately disclose risks or its security practices.\n\nThe details from his Equifax class-action suit are BONKERShttps://t.co/SBDumoufDf pic.twitter.com/iI0I41lAAN \u2014 Jane Lytvynenko \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f (@JaneLytv) October 18, 2019\n\nThe lawsuit was filed by people who bought shares of Equifax between Feb. 25, 2016 and Sept. 15, 2017. In September 2017 Equifax announced a data breach that exposed the personal information of 147 million people. The company settled with the FTC for $425 million in September 2019.\n\nThe lawsuit claims damages from the fact that the investments lost value due to \"multiple false or misleading statements and omissions about the sensitive personal information in Equifax\u2019s custody, the vulnerability of its internal systems to cyberattack, and its compliance with data protection laws and cybersecurity best practices.\u201d\n\nIn June, Equifax filed a motion to dismiss.\n\nEquifax's 1-year performance, charted on Yahoo Finance Premium with significant events. More\n\n\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s Complaint is devoid of facts even plausibly suggesting that Defendants were aware of any information contradicting their public statements when made,\u201d the motion reads. \u201cInstead, Plaintiff\u2019s claims hang almost entirely on the unsupported and implausible notion that Defendants knowingly and deliberately failed to patch the software vulnerability at issue in the Cybersecurity Incident\u2014at no conceivable benefit to themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuch more plausible is the very explanation Plaintiff pleads, as stated in [former Equifax CEO Richard] Smith\u2019s Congressional testimony addressing the Cybersecurity Incident \u2014 that unfortunate and unintentional human and system failures contributed to the breach,\u201d Equifax said.\n\nThe class action is still pending certification before it can go forward.\n\nEquifax did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.\n\n--\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, personal finance, retail, airlines, and more.
