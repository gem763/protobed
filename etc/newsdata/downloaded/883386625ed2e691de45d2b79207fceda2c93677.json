Coach Jeff Brohm indicated Monday that Sindelar suffered a setback late last week that could keep the Boilermakers\u2019 starter out for a second straight game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still doing exactly what the doctors say,\u201d Brohm said during his weekly news conference. \u201cI think he\u2019s making progress. We\u2019ll see how this week goes. Really last week we thought he was making progress Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it wasn\u2019t until Thursday where some things popped up again, and that\u2019s where we had to start the process over.\u201d\n\nSindelar was injured on Purdue\u2019s final offensive play in a 42-24 victory over Vanderbilt on Sept. 7.\n\nBrohm acknowledged later Sindelar probably wouldn\u2019t have finished that game if the Boilermakers (1-2) had another possession. At the time of the injury, Sindelar led the Football Bowl Subdivision with 932 yards passing and was tied for the national lead in touchdown passes with nine.\n\nDoctors didn\u2019t clear Sindelar in time to face TCU the following week - and the difference was noticeable.\n\nRedshirt freshman Jack Plummer made his college debut in the 34-13 loss, going 13 of 29 with 181 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions and will likely start again if Sindelar can\u2019t play against the surging Golden Gophers (3-0), who have won five straight and six of seven - a stretch that began with last year\u2019s 41-10 rout over the Boilermakers.\n\nBut Brohm knows there was plenty of blame to spread around and hasn\u2019t lost faith in Plummer.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be a very good quarterback, and sometimes you have to go through a few struggles to improve,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cWe have to improve as a team, there\u2019s no question about that, and we\u2019re going to need to show that this Saturday, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been getting the performance out of everyone that we need in order to win.\u201d\n\nSindelar isn\u2019t the only player the Boilermakers hope to get back.\n\nRight guard Matt McCann, Purdue\u2019s most experienced lineman, and receiver Jared Sparks both missed the TCU game with ankle injuries. Receiver David Bell hurt his shoulder during the second half against the Horned Frogs and defensive tackle Lorenzo Neal isn\u2019t expected back until at least early October as he continues recovering from offseason knee surgery.\n\nBrohm said Sparks and Bell were held out of practice last week and McCann\u2019s availability will be determined later this week.\n\nStill, the hope was last week\u2019s bye would give Sindelar enough time to be cleared to play heading into this week. Instead, the process restarted and now Brohm must again play the waiting game as he seeks better results regardless of who starts at quarterback.\n\n\u201cWhile Elijah is our starter, at the same time you have to have more guys ready to compete, and you saw that really in Game 3,\u201d Brohm said. \u201cIt\u2019s not all on Jack, but we lost our starting quarterback, didn\u2019t play well on offense. It\u2019s important you have two quarterbacks, it\u2019s important you have multiple guys at other positions because you never know when they\u2019re going to be down, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to build.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Purdue quarterback Elijah Sindelar already has spent two weeks going through the concussion protocol.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Michael Marot"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/14/tcu_purdue_football_64224_c0-166-3974-2483_s1770x1032.jpg?777ce8afb39540d8b90db4bec8b0fa1efb197a66", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
