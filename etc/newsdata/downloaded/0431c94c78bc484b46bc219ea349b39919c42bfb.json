SLAM man who was stabbed to death", "language": "en", "text": "Viewers of 999: What's Your Emergency? last night slammed a man who had been stabbed to death after it emerged he had been trying to mug somebody when he suffered his injuries.\n\nThe Channel 4 programme followed the case of Hayden Maslen, 18, from Wiltshire, who said Jordan Taylor, 25, had approached him in the street and hit him over the head with a can of air freshener before trying to take his bag.\n\nHayden revealed he'd been 'terrified' the stranger was planning to kill him and, after a scuffle ensued, he pulled out a knife and stabbed him.\n\nDespite the fact that Jordan later died of his injuries many of those watching were unsympathetic, with one commenting: 'The death wouldn't have happened if he was a law-abiding sort in the first place would it?'\n\nViewers of last night's 999: What's Your Emergency? were sympathetic to Hayden Maslen, 18, from Wiltshire, who stabbed Jordan Taylor, 25, to death\n\nJordan was stabbed four times by Hayden and died as a result of his injuries, with the teenager pleading self defence\n\nMany of those watching were unsympathetic to Jordan, with some suggesting Hayden's 20 month sentence was 'fair'\n\nAnother commented: 'Feel very little for the lad who lost his life, or his friend. The sentence in my opinion was fair.'\n\nOn the night of Sunday 12th March 2017, Jordan's friend Neil, phoned paramedics to describe a 'massive f***** stab' wound his friend had suffered during a scuffle in the street late at night.\n\nHe told police: 'Can't really remember [what happened], this bloke came at us with a knife, went for Jordan first and then I jumped in.'\n\nNeil told police that the man had 'a 3 inch blade with a rounded tip on it', which he'd stabbed Jordan with.\n\nAs paramedics tried to treat Jordan, his friend Neil was helped by police, and said that a 'bloke had come at us with a knife'\n\nDCI Jim Carter of Wiltshire's major crime team, said: 'Wiltshire has about three to four murders a year. Most are domestically related.\n\n'When you don't know who the offender is, there is a race against time to catch them.'\n\nAs police searched CCTV evidence for a prime suspect, they questioned Neil further as to what had happened that night.\n\nHe went on to admit that the night played out a little differently than he had first explained to police.\n\nNeil was stabbed in the back during the attack, and initially told paramedics and police it had been 'unprovoked'\n\nNeil confessed the men were on their way to buy cocaine when Jordan said they should 'pull over' .\n\nHe revealed: 'Then he got a can of air freshener, and hit him with it.'\n\nDI Jim Taylor explained: 'Neil was key to the investigation. We wouldn't class him as someone who was independent, as he was a friend of Jordan and had been involved in the crime.'\n\nHe added: 'Neil has got to reconcile that Jordan was his best friend, but he was also the one who instigated it. It's a horrible thing for him to deal with.'\n\nHowever later Neil admitted that Jordan had initiated the attack by hitting the man over the head with an air freshener before he was stabbed\n\nNeil went on to admit that he had been stabbed when he had tried to break the two men up.\n\nAnd as police hunted through CCTV of the evening, they uncovered the killer's car in which he had escaped from the scene.\n\nBut while they furiously scoured the footage for the perpetrator of the crime, Hayden Maslen, 18, handed himself in, along with the knife used in the offence, his bag, and the clothes he'd been wearing.\n\nStaff at the front desk explained: 'Hayden has brought himself into the police station today to state that he is responsible for the injuries on Sunday 12th March, and therefore he has been arrested as a result of that.'\n\nPolice desperately hunted through CCTV in order to find further evidence that might lead them to the killer\n\nDSI Jim said: 'We started analysing some more of the truth and getting to the bottom of what happened that night.'\n\nThe police recording of Hayden's interview revealed he had been on the way home from a friend's house when two men had tried to mug him.\n\nHe said that he had packed his bag, which contained sweets, a bottle of drink, his mother's birthday present and a folding knife, which he said he 'carried for protection'.\n\nPolice described it as an 'aggressive' looking knife, 'designed specifically for creating large amount of injury.'\n\nStaff were stunned by Hayden Maslen, 18, handed himself in to police and confessed to the crime, even bringing the knife used in the offence with him\n\nHayden said he had bought it from a man in the park after a friend had had his door kicked in, and admitted it was 'stupid'.\n\nHe went on to explain that when he'd heard a car door slam shut, he'd been startled, before a man confidently approached him and hit him with a bottle.\n\nHayden then said another man tried to drag his bag off him, and he had the knife in his hand, and he punched out at him.\n\nHe said: 'I was just frightened and I thought I was going to get killed over a f****** bag.'\n\nThe teenager said he'd been terrified he was going to be killed, and had been carrying the knife 'as protection'\n\nHe said his intention was to 'scare them off', saying: 'I did not want to hurt either of them.'\n\nHe added: 'I've been looking back on it since it happened, thinking you're a f****** idiot.'\n\nMeanwhile DSI Jim said: 'He will carry the burden of taking someone's life for the rest of his life.'\n\nHayden went on to be charged with murder of Anthony Jordan Taylor, but later he was found not guilty and acquitted of manslaughter, wounding with intent and wounding without intent.\n\nDSI Jim Carter said that Hayden would have to 'carry the burden of taking someone's life' for the rest of his days\n\nHe pleaded guilty to the offence of carrying an offensive weapon and sentenced to 20 months in a young offender's institute.\n\nDSI Jim said: 'Jordan Taylor has lost his life and Hayden Maslen has taken that life. If I was Jordan's parents, I would want Hayden to go to prison. And if I was Hayden's parents, I would want him to be alive.'\n\nViewers were shocked by the case, with many siding with Hayden.\n\nOne said: 'Clearly the right verdict. Don't start something and then whine when the victim fights back.'\n\nViewers of the Channel 4 programme said they had little sympathy for Jordan Taylor, with one saying he 'deserved' what had happened\n\nOne commented: 'God what a dilemma. Started off sad and incensed at the appalling loss of life. Ended up sorry and sad for all of them. WTF is the answer?'\n\nAnother added: 'Because he was attacked by two idiots thinking he was a soft target who ended up coming unstuck. Live by the sword.'\n\nOne wrote: 'Jordan Taylor died because he was a criminal. Justice served and enough said. That copper was wrong at the end.'", "description": "Viewers of Channel 4's 999: What's Your Emergency? slammed Jordan Taylor, 25, from Wiltshire, who was stabbed by Hayden Maslen, 18, during an attempted street robbery.", "authors": ["Harriet Johnston For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/09/20318828-0-image-a-46_1572343126158.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
