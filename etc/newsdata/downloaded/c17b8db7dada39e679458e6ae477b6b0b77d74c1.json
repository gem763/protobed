However, official Home Office statistics indicate that only 609,000 people have received this status.\n\nAnother 342,600 people have been granted pre-settled status, which requires them to reapply for the permanent status once they can prove that they have been permanent residents in the UK for five years.\n\nMore than 600,000 EU citizens apply for UK settled status Read more\n\nOrganisations representing EU nationals said it was worrying that senior ministers should be giving out such inaccurate figures. \u201cEither they are propagandising, trying to reassure people they are treating them well, or they don\u2019t understand how the system works,\u201d Chai Patel, the legal policy director of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said.\n\nInterviewed on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One, Gove, who heads the Cabinet Office and is in charge of planning for a no-deal Brexit, said the system was \u201cworking well\u201d. \u201cWe have had 1 million people who have received settled status,\u201d he said. He dismissed the concerns of lawyers and charities supporting EU nationals, stating that he regretted there were \u201cone or two people who are attempting to make political capital out of the situation.\u201d\n\nDuring a phone-in on LBC radio on Monday morning, Rees-Mogg was asked to comment on a Guardian report that noted that the number of people being allocated pre-settled status had jumped from 32% in the testing phase to 42% in July. He responded: \u201cA million people have got settled status. I think that is a considerable success.\u201d\n\nBut lawyers and campaign groups stress there is a significant difference between receiving settled status and pre-settled status, which forces EU nationals to continue to maintain continuous residence, making life more complicated for those who need to work or study abroad.\n\nWhile most of those given pre-settled status may have expected to be given this more temporary leave to remain, because they have not yet been in the UK for five years, a rising number of people who have lived here for many years have complained that they have been wrongly allocated the lesser rights.\n\n\u201cThe ministers appear to be saying: \u2018We\u2019ve got a brilliant system and 1 million people have been registered, stop talking to us about it.\u2019 Which is a grossly irresponsible thing to say. If people are getting pre-settled status they are at risk of becoming undocumented in five years\u2019 time,\u201d Patel said.\n\nJavid defends settled status scheme in response to criticism Read more\n\n\u201cThe Home Office has still not addressed any of our concerns over how these people are going to be supported or helped or guaranteed their rights.\u201d\n\nTahmid Chowdhury, co-founder of Here for Good, a charity set up to provide free immigration services to EU citizens in the UK, said: \u201cSenior members of the government are repeatedly misleading the public over the number of individuals granted settled status \u2013 either deliberately, which could be malicious, or unintentionally, which could be incompetent.\u201d\n\nFailing to distinguish between the two categories was very significant, he said, adding: \u201cBecause pre-settled status, which accounts for about a third of application outcomes, offers less protection of citizens\u2019 rights than settled status.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cBoth pre-settled status and settled status allow people to work, study, receive healthcare and access benefits and services as they do now. Nobody has been granted pre-settled status without first being offered the opportunity to submit evidence to show they qualify for settled status and once they have been resident for five years they can apply for settled status.\n\n\u201cEU citizens are our friends and neighbours and we want them to stay and they have until at least 31 December, 2020 to apply to the EU settlement scheme.\u201d", "description": "Cabinet ministers accused of misleading public in statements about EU citizens\u2019 rights", "authors": ["Amelia Gentleman", "Marley Morris", "Marie Le Conte"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46f5d6370c1e8afc6fa234cad0130ca75ad441c3/85_340_2472_1482/master/2472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee1ae11642b125deb2449114929e296a"}
