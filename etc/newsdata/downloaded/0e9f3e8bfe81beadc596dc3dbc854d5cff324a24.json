(AP) \u2014 Police are searching for a man who walked into a bank in Nebraska this week and tried to open a checking account with a fake $1 million bill.\n\nStaff at the Pinnacle Bank branch in Lincoln reported the Monday morning incident to police. The Lincoln Journal Star reports that bank employees say the man was adamant that the bill was real despite tellers\u2019 attempts to convince him otherwise.\n\nThe man eventually left with the bill, but without a new account.\n\nPolice are reviewing surveillance video to try to identify the man. Police say they want to check on his welfare and make sure he was not the victim of a crime.\n\nThe largest denomination note ever issued for public circulation was the $10,000 bill.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lincoln Journal Star, http://www.journalstar.com", "description": "Police in Lincoln, Nebraska, are hoping to cash in on leads.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db9ad892000000c355073c6.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
