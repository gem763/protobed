Getty Images 6/21 Neal Maupay (Brighton & Hove Albion) Brighton's \u00a316m summer signing is still working to consolidate his place in Graham Potter's preferred starting XI.

CameraSport via Getty Images 7/21 Lewis Cook (Bournemouth) The midfielder is yet to feature this season as he continues his comeback from knee ligament damage.

Chelsea desperate need him to hit the ground running, which will be difficult considering his lack of pre-season. Getty 12/21 Lys Mousset (Sheffield United) There are question marks over the fitness of David McGoldrick and Callum Robinson, who were both withdrawn from international duty recently, meaning Lys Mousset could be handed a start. REUTERS 13/21 Christian Eriksen (Tottenham Hotspur) Christian Eriksen failed to secure a move away from Spurs ahead of the European transfer deadline and will stay on in north London, although he has yet to sign a new deal with the club. \"He never said he was not happy here - he always was,\" Mauricio Pochettino said this weekend. \"I said before the Arsenal game that he was in the right mind - that's why I selected him for that game and I will continue to select him.

Getty Images 19/21 James Maddison (Manchester United) Manchester United sniffed around James Maddison this summer, ultimately deciding against bidding for the 22-year-old. But the speculation has persisted and all eyes will be on the midfielder at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon.
