In a statement Neumann said he was \u201cproud of this team and the incredible company that we have built over the last decade\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive,\u201d he said. Neumann says he will continue on as non-executive chairman.\n\nThe company, now known as We, is one of the world\u2019s most valuable startups and Neumann\u2019s demotion marks a dramatic fall from grace for one of the most high-profile executives of the new generation of tech companies.\n\nWe scrapped plans for an initial public offering last month after investors balked at the company\u2019s sky-high valuation. We had been valued at $47bn, despite losing $3bn in the last three years. That price was cut by more than half ahead of the proposed share sale but even that price seemed too high to many investors.\n\nInvestors were also concerned that Neumann had taken $700m out of the company ahead of the share sale and would keep tight control even after it.\n\nMeetings between the board and We\u2019s largest investor, Japan\u2019s SoftBank, began on Monday to discuss the possibility of Neumann being demoted.\n\nThose meetings came after the Journal reported a private jet chartered by Neumann had to be grounded after a large amount of marijuana was found onboard. The report also detailed tequila-fuelled company parties and bizarre statements by Neumann about his plans to become immortal and to use We to \u201csolve the problem of children without parents\u201d.\n\nAccording to the tech news source the Information, WeWork executives and the company\u2019s bankers have been discussing laying off a third of We\u2019s workforce, about 5,000 people, among various plans to cut costs at the heavily loss-making company.\n\nWeWork has shaken up the sleepy world of office rentals by leasing space, giving them a millennial make-over with potted plants, communal areas and beer taps and then leasing them to startups and other would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nWeWork reported that it had 527,000 members and 528 locations at the end of June and said it plans to open 169 new locations. In London, it owns or leases more spaces than any enterprise except the government. Larger companies (including the Guardian) also rent WeWork space.\n\nBut while the company has grown fast, so have its losses and even We has conceded that it may never make a profit.\n\nWe\u2019s revenues in 2018 were $1.82bn, more than four times larger than they were in 2016. At the same time the company lost $2.9bn in the last three years.\n\nThe company\u2019s share sale prospectus warned: \u201cWe have a history of losses and, especially if we continue to grow at an accelerated rate, we may be unable to achieve profitability at a company level \u2026 for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nWe has burned through more than $2bn in 2018 and on current projections could run out of cash sometime next year if its fortunes do not turn or it fails to raise more money.\n\nSoftbank has invested more than $9bn in the company and has reportedly soured on Neumann\u2019s leadership in recent months.\n\nHis departure would be the most high-profile ousting of a tech entrepreneur since Uber sidelined its co-founder Travis Kalanick in 2017 after a series of scandals at the ride-sharing company. Uber, which is also heavily loss-making, managed to press ahead with its IPO but its share sale has stumbled, and shares are down over 20% since their debut.", "description": "Executive to step down at troubled office rental company after plans for an initial public offering were scrapped last monthAdam Neumann, CEO of WeWork.
