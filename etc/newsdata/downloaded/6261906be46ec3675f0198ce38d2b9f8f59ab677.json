Advocates Say That's Illegal", "language": "en", "text": "Forty-four numbers need to be called before Sofia and her family finally have the chance to seek asylum in the United States. Camped out in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez with her husband and two kids, she anxiously waits for her number to be called. The family arrived in August, after they fled threats from a cartel in their hometown in Zacatecas in Central Mexico.\n\nOfficials told the family to wait in line behind thousands of asylum seekers \u2013 Cubans, Hondurans, Salvadorans, Ugandans and more. Instead the family pitched a tent by the bridge and joined a separate list for Mexican asylum seekers, which sprung up in recent weeks.\n\n\u201c[Other migrants] say it\u2019s better to wait here,\u201d says Sofia, whose name has been changed because she fears retaliation for speaking out. \u201cThe other way could take years.\u201d\n\nLegally, migrants like Sofia and her family should be able to present themselves at a U.S. port of entry to request asylum. But since at least 2016, U.S. officials from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have only allowed a limited number of asylum seekers \u2013 although they won\u2019t say just how many \u2013 to present themselves at a port of entry each day in a process known to immigration advocates as metering. (One official speaking to TIME said the number used to be around 70 per day for one port of entry in Juarez, but is now around 30.) At least one class action lawsuit has challenged metering as illegal for all asylum seekers, but for Mexican asylum seekers, metering is particularly dangerous.\n\n\u201cUnder U.S. and international law, CBP can\u2019t turn them away at a port of entry, especially a Mexican national because you are returning them to the same country from which they\u2019re fleeing persecution,\u201d says Shaw Drake, policy counsel at the ACLU Border Rights Center.\n\nMexicans like Sofia have grown frustrated with the delay. There are now an estimated 26,000 people of all nationalities on metering lists in Mexican border cities, including Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Matamoros, Nogales, and Tijuana. Some are staying in shelters that have grown more crowded as some 50,000 people have been turned back to await their court dates under the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as Remain in Mexico. Others live in tents on the streets in cities where temperatures can reach the high 80s and 90s and murders and kidnappings are common. In Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, these Mexican asylum seekers hope staying close to the bridge means they won\u2019t miss their chance when CBP allows the next people to present themselves.\n\n\u201cThey just tell us to wait,\u201d says Monica, a 30-year-old mother from the western Mexican state of Michoac\u00e1n who fled cartel violence with her husband and three daughters. The family is number 165 on the list. \u201cThey don\u2019t give us answers. Nothing progresses.\u201d\n\nHomicides, kidnappings and disappearances have increased in Mexico in the last decade as drug cartels fight over key territory. The government\u2019s military response has had limited success. But dating back to the Obama Administration, Mexican nationals have received asylum at lower rates than the national average. From 2011 to 2016, Mexico had one of the highest asylum denial rates of any nationality, with about 90 percent of cases denied, according to data gathering organization TRAC. In 2018, only about 15 percent of Mexican asylum seekers won their cases, compared to the 35 percent average for all nationalities.", "description": "A new 'metering' practice is particularly dangerous for Mexican asylum seekers", "authors": ["Anna-Catherine Brigida", "Ciudad Juarez", "Matamoros"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qMRMUTyvmN5WCHYspnSbEw--~B/aD0xNjAxO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/3aac7491cf52002fb1307104ab3ba2e5", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
