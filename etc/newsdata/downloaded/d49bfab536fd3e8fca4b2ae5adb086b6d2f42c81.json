How is this even real life?\"\n\nOne user replied: \u201cThere is absolutely no way that was not on purpose. How dare he treat these women are much better than he ever will be and have accomplished much more in life than he has.\u201d\n\nAnother added: \u201cTrump gives our two female spacewalkers his middle finger as they correct him, saying they are not the first women to walk in space, as he had said. Flipping the bird was so obvious. Oh, how crude.\u201d\n\nOne user described his \u201cstupidity\" as \"out of this world\u201d.", "description": "The US President appeared to scratch his forehead with his middle finger after NASA astronaut Jessica Meir called him out", "authors": ["Christopher Bucktin", "Image", "Nasa Zuma Wire Rex", "Splashnews.Com"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20670209.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Worlds-first-all-female-spacewalking-team-International-Space-Station-18-Oct-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
