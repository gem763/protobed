Sayegh did not respond when contacted by ABC News.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump speaks during the 9th Shale Insight Conference at the David L.

Former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime friend of the president who campaigned with him aggressively during the elections, has been approached for that role, according to aides close to the president.\n\nThat role was initially designed for former South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. Despite being announced as having joined the team, sources say Gowdy is unlikely to aide in the president's defense given restrictions on lobbying for past members of Congress, among other issues.\n\nPHOTO: Representative Trey Gowdy delivers a farewell address at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., Dec. 19, 2018.

In recent weeks, Kushner has taken an expanded role relating to the impeachment probe.\n\nThe potential moves suggest the White House has recognized a need for a stronger offense, despite push-back last month by the president himself to create any war room operation.\n\n(MORE: Former GOP Rep.
