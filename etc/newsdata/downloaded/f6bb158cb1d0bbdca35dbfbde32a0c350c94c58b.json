Bank of America declined to comment.\n\nIrving, Texas-based Exxon has ramped up sales of assets around the world in recent months with the goal of raising $15 billion from disposals by 2021. Those include production in Norway, Australia, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and Britain.\n\nExxon operates in Malaysia 35 oil and gas platforms in 12 offshore fields and has working interests in another 10 platforms in five fields in the South China Sea, according to its website.\n\nThe operations produce 15% of Malaysia's oil output of 600,000 barrels per day and half of its output of over 2 billion cubic feet per day.\n\nThe fields are operated under a 50% and 78% stake in two large production sharing contracts (PSC), consultancy WoodMackenzie said in a note.\n\n\"The Malaysian assets are both operated and generally highly mature, with a significant amount of ageing infrastructure. A buyer will need to have strong operating credentials, and be recognized by (Malaysian national oil company) Petronas to be a suitably qualified and reputable operator,\" one banker said.", "description": "Exxon names BAML to run Malaysia asset sales: sources", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF980QE_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
