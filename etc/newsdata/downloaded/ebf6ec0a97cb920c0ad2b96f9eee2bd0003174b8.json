REUTERS/Lim Huey Teng\n\nMalaysia is too small to face up to the Asian powerhouse, even though Chinese ships surveying its waters for oil and gas in South China Sea do so without permission, he told an online news service during a visit to New York this week.\n\n\"We watch what they are doing, we report what they are doing, but we do not chase them away or try to be aggressive,\" Mahathir told BenarNews here\n\n\u201cThe Malay states have existed near China for the past 2,000 years. We have survived because we know how to conduct ourselves. We don\u2019t go around trying to be aggressive when we don\u2019t have the capacity, so we use other means.\u201d\n\nHe said that in the past Malaysia used to send to China \u201cgold and silver flowers every year as a symbol of our being practically, well, subservient to them\u201d.\n\nThis month, China and Malaysia agreed to set up a joint dialogue mechanism for the South China Sea, as ties between the countries improve. China is Malaysia\u2019s biggest trading partner.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has been overseeing a sweeping plan to refurbish its army as the country ramps up its presence in the South China Sea and around self-ruled Taiwan, rattling nerves around the region and in Washington.\n\nMahathir also said China\u2019s might was the reason Muslim-majority Malaysia did not speak out much against Beijing\u2019s alleged repression of Uighur Muslims.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just try and do something which would fail anyway, so it is better to find some other less violent ways not to antagonise China too much, because China is beneficial for us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s is a big trading partner of ours and you do not want to do something that will fail, and in the process, also, we will suffer.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations says at least 1 million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in what China describes as \u201cvocational training centers\u201d to stamp out extremism and give people new skills.\n\nThe 94-year-old leader also said Malaysia\u2019s police was trying to ascertain if fugitive financier Low Taek Jho was in China. Investigators have named Low, better known as Jho Low, as a key figure in the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), which U.S. and Malaysian prosecutors say was used to siphon out hundreds of millions of dollars.", "description": "Malaysia does not want to take a confrontational stance towards China over the disputed South China Sea and Beijing's alleged mistreatment of its minority Uighur Muslims, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in an interview published on Saturday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190928&t=2&i=1434870743&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8R0CN", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
