The building is gone.\u201d\n\nMaine public safety officials said the fallen firefighter, 68-year-old Fire Capt. Michael Bell, was a 30-year member of the Farmington Fire Department.\n\nHis brother, Fire Chief Terry Bell, and four other firefighters are being treated at Maine Medical Center in Portland, about 70 miles away.\n\nOfficials said four of the five are in the intensive care unit. Another firefighter had less severe injuries and was treated and released, as was an ambulance worker. A LEAP employee was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nA police officer stands guard at the scene of a deadly propane explosion that leveled a new building in Farmington, Maine.

Nearby buildings were damaged and several businesses shut down.\n\nFranklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols said the closest comparison he could make was what he saw in war-torn Iraq during the year he spent as an adviser to the country's national police midway through last decade.\n\n\u201cIt was just total devastation. I\u2019ve never seen destruction like that in my career,\" Nichols said. \"I\u2019ve been in law enforcement 35 years. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before in my life, except overseas. It was horrible.\"\n\nPhotos here show the explosion aftermath in Farmington @wgme\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcf8: Jacob Gage pic.twitter.com/a1lnzR9n2T\n\n\n\n\u2014 Katie Sampson (@KatieWGME) September 16, 2019\n\nKim Hilton works at the nearby University of Maine. \u201cIt felt like someone hit our building with a vehicle,\" she said.\n\nOur hearts go out to all those impacted by this tragedy, especially to the loved ones of the firefighter lost and others injured. I am grateful for the work of first responders who are at the scene and urge Maine people to avoid the area.

He said his stepfather, a firefighter and town employee, was the first to arrive at the site of the blast.\n\n\u201cThe scene was very ominous,\" Gage told the network. \u201cThere was still insulation falling from the sky like a gentle snow, and first responders were running around trying to administer first aid.\"\n\nSaudi oil attack roils global energy markets: Trump says US 'locked and loaded'\n\nLEAP worker Lisa Charles, who lives down the street from the blast, said she was at home with her kids and feared the worst when she saw debris falling from the sky.\n\n\u201cI know everybody in there. I thought for sure everybody was gone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey got a warning from the maintenance guy who was a hero for telling them to evacuate.\u201d\n\nMaine Gov. Janet Mills hails from Farmington, and her office said she knew Michael Bell. Mills tweeted her condolences and said in a statement she visited the site of the accident and the fire department. She said the State Fire Marshal\u2019s Office will investigate.\n\n\u201cFarmington is a strong, close-knit and resilient community, of which I am proud to be part,'' said Mills, who ordered the state's flags to be flown at half-staff. \"This loss is devastating and felt by all of Maine.\"\n\nFarmington, with a population of 7,600, is about 70 miles north of Portland.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Farmington, Maine explosion at LEAP Inc.: 1 dead in propane blast", "description": "A firefighter was killed and at least six others were injured when a powerful propane explosion destroyed a new building Monday in Farmington, Maine.", "authors": ["Jorge L.
