How to handle the challenge of health care is an issue that is not only dividing politicians \u2013 but voters, too. According to the Fox News poll, 68 percent of people said they support expanding the Medicare program so that everyone has the option to buy in \u2013 if they choose to. Twenty-four percent of respondents opposed that measure, which is generally supported by more moderate Democratic candidates.\n\nMeanwhile, 57 percent of people supported making minor changes to ObamaCare \u2013 a policy peddled by Democratic frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden (compared to 34 percent in opposition). Biden said during the most recent debate, he was \u201cfor [President] Barack [Obama],\u201d adding that \u201cObamaCare worked.\u201d\n\nSlightly more respondents than not said they do not favor eliminating private insurance altogether (48 percent to 46 percent) \u2013 as proposed in Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \"Medicare for All\" plan, which is also endorsed by Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClosely following health care, participants in the poll feel that gun control and immigration -- both tied for nine percent -- are the second most important issues in the upcoming election. Former Texas congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke made headlines during the last Democratic debate for saying he would take away people\u2019s weapons, while advocating for a mandatory buyback program. President Trump on Wednesday called O\u2019Rourke a \u201cdummy\u201d for making that comment, which he alleged made it harder to pass gun-control legislation on Capitol Hill.\n\nAnd when it comes to who Americans think will win the 2020 election \u2013 a majority of respondents (46 percent) thought Trump would be re-elected, compared with 40 percent who did not. Confidence in Trump\u2019s re-election rose from 39 percent in Dec. 2018 \u2013 when more people thought he would lose the 2020 vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThe poll was conducted between Sept. 15-17, 2019, under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company (R), this Fox News Poll includes interviews with 1,008 randomly chosen registered voters nationwide who spoke with live interviewers on both landlines and cellphones.
