Bindi Irwin is officially in wedding planning mode as the 21-year-old gets ready to tie the knot with her 22-year-old fianc\u00e9 Chandler Powell.\n\nThe wedding will take place at the Australia Zoo, a special spot for the couple.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where we met, it\u2019s where we got engaged, it only makes sense to have it at the Australia Zoo,\u201d Powell said.\n\nThe wedding ceremony will be a little more \u2013 wild -- than traditional nuptials. The couple says there will be \u201clots and lots\u201d of animals around during the ceremony and that Irwin will even walk down the aisle holding a koala.\n\n\u201cWe may be setting some new trends for weddings from here on out,\u201d Irwin joked.\n\nWhen it comes to planning, Powell says Irwin is super organized, comparing her wedding planning style to a popular \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d character.\n\n\u201cBindi is 100% Lesley Knope. She has colored-coded binders, she has itineraries for all of us, it makes my job easy,\u201d Powell said.\n\nAnd while Irwin admits she has been on top of it, she says she left one important detail until the last minute \u2013 her dress. Thankfully, she was able to check it off her list this weekend in New York City, with her mom by her side.\n\n\u201cI left my dress until the last minute but I\u2019m really excited about it,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s really special. I love it so much because it kind of mimics my mom\u2019s beautiful dress so I found something that paid tribute to her beautiful wedding dress and I\u2019m thrilled.\u201d\n\nIrwin says season two of \u201cCrikey! It\u2019s the Irwins\u201d will show her and Powell\u2019s engagement. She says fans will also get to see the couple release a koala back into the wild together to commemorate their engagement -- a moment the couple called \u201creally special.\u201d\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, the couple says they both feel \u201clucky\u201d to have found their \u201cperson in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes a relationship so wonderful,\u201d Irwin said. \u201cYou have to marry your best friend.\u201d", "description": "Bindi Irwin is officially in wedding planning mode as the 21-year-old gets ready to tie the knot with her 22-year-old fianc\u00e9 Chandler Powell.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/irwins-gma-abc-ps1-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
