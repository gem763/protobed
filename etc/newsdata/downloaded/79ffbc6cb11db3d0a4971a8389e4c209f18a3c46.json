Our first visit I remember saying, \u201cI\u2019m not even really sure how this works or what I\u2019m supposed to do or if I even need therapy.\u201d She told me that it was a place to talk through interactions, thoughts, desires, failures \u2014 really anything that I felt was added baggage to my person. I started with what prompted me to seek her out in the first place, and began talking about my difficulties with certain people and what they voiced as their issues with me. Over time we addressed these issues and basically determined how much of it was bulls--- and how much of it was real s--- that was in my way. Which brought us to my real true concern: Am I in my own way? When people were telling me that some people don\u2019t like me, it wasn\u2019t so much that I truly cared if they liked me or nah, but rather, I wondered if by not being compatible with them I was hindering the forward movement of my craft. There were traits about me that were consistently called into question. \u201cYou\u2019re difficult!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re condescending!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re too direct,\u201d among others, were the hit tunes on the album, \u201cUnlikeable: No, Really, People Don\u2019t Like You.\u201d But perhaps the biggest epiphany was realizing how much I had internalized their words and had reached a point where I didn\u2019t like myself! My own dag-on self, y\u2019all!", "description": "An excerpt from the comedian\u2019s new book, \u2018Small Doses: Potent Truths for Everyday Use\u2019", "authors": ["Amanda Seales", "Amanda Seales Is A Comedian", "Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V2BGX-CnW_LIzLb7xuGhAVB-hag=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VRZUV64FUZGT3OILIRMBFQEZPI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
