And if the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis loses, Missouri is set to become the only state in the nation without an abortion clinic since the procedure was legalized more than 40 years ago.\n\nMissouri and Planned Parenthood will argue over whether the clinic should keep its license to perform abortions during a weeklong hearing in front of the Administrative Hearing Commission. The state agency could rule anytime afterward.\n\nBonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told VICE News that Planned Parenthood\u2019s appearance before the commission was unprecedented for the reproductive health care giant. Planned Parenthood, she said, is now wading into \u201cuncharted waters.\u201d\n\nThe number of abortion clinics in Missouri has dwindled over the last decade, as the deep-red state has tightened its restrictions on the procedure. Then, in late May, Planned Parenthood of St. Louis announced that its future was also in jeopardy. The clinic said that the state health department was refusing to renew its license to perform the procedure due to concerns about what case records call \u201cdeficiencies.\u201d\n\nREAD: Google Maps is still directing women seeking abortions to pro-life clinics.\n\n\u201cThe weaponizing of inspections processes in the provision of abortion care has escalated as an anti-abortion tactic by anti-abortion politicians, to find ways of effectively banning abortion in states, without overturning Roe,\u201d Lee-Gilmore said. \u201cReally, what\u2019s at stake is abortion access for 1.1 million women of reproductive age in the state.\u201d\n\nIn court documents, Missouri alleged that its officials had discovered that evidence of two failed abortions, as well as an abortion that took place after the patient was more than 21 weeks into a pregnancy and resulted in her needing to be transferred to a hospital.\n\nMissouri ultimately asked the Planned Parenthood clinic to comply with three demands. First, the clinic had to adjust which provider gave patients who want abortions state-mandated counseling. Second, its providers had to perform two pelvic exams on every patient who wanted an abortion. Finally, the clinic had to make its physicians available for interviews with state investigators.\n\nPlanned Parenthood initially agreed to the first two requests. But the organization said it could not force all of its physicians to sit for interviews, because several were not directly employed by Planned Parenthood. Those physicians had declined to participate in interviews.\n\nPlanned Parenthood asked a court to grant an order to let them continue performing abortions. The organization also eventually declared that it would not force patients to undergo two pelvic exams.\n\n\u201cOver the last few weeks, I have new evidence to say that 100% of the patients who I've taken care of who've undergone this inappropriate, medically unnecessary, unethical pelvic exam have been harmed by that,\u201d David Eisenberg, the clinic\u2019s medical director, told CBS News at the time. \u201cBecause to do so, in my opinion, is just assault.\u201d\n\nMissouri agreed not to enforce that requirement.\n\nStill, after weeks of legal scuffling, Missouri declined to renew Planned Parenthood\u2019s license \u2014 but a judge ruled that the clinic could keep offering abortions anyway and asked the Administrative Hearing Commission to weigh in on the case.\n\n\n\nArguments this week are expected to focus on questions about patients\u2019 safety. A landmark report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine declared last year that abortion is \u201csafe and effective.\u201d Instead, the report blamed state regulations on abortion for creating barriers to \u201csafe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable abortion services.\u201d\n\nLee-Gilmore maintains that Missouri\u2019s case is politically motivated, pointing out that Republican Gov. Mike Parson recently signed into law a bill that included a cavalcade of abortion restrictions, including a ban on abortion as early as eight weeks into pregnancy. That law is currently blocked from taking effect.\n\nREAD: These 5 states are the next battlegrounds in the abortion wars.\n\nThe motives of Parson\u2019s administration also came under scrutiny after the governor\u2019s then-communications director, Steele Shippy, organized a conference call with Republican legislators and anti-abortion activists the night before a judge ruled in May to temporarily keep Planned Parenthood of St. Louis open, according to the Kansas City Star. The emailed invite for the call included the hashtag \u201c#shutthemdown.\u201d\n\nShippy has said that the governor\u2019s office did not set up the call. The Missouri attorney general\u2019s office has also said that Shippy did not have a formal role in the state\u2019s health department.\n\n\u201cThe state will have you believe that this is about abortion patient health and safety,\u201d Lee-Gilmore said. \u201cThis has nothing to do with patient health and safety.\u201d\n\nChris Nuelle, spokesperson for the Missouri Attorney General\u2019s Office, said the office generally has a policy against commenting on ongoing litigation. \u201cThe Missouri Attorney General\u2019s Office is tasked with defending the laws and statutes of the state from legal challenge \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in this suit and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do,\u201d Nuelle told VICE News over email.\n\nIf the commission rules against Planned Parenthood, Lee-Gilmore said that the group would review all of its options, including, potentially, going back to traditional court. Planned Parenthood has also recently opened a new, 18,000-square-foot clinic just about 13 miles from its St. Louis location \u2014 but in Illinois, which is far friendlier to abortion rights.\n\nCover: Abortion-rights supporters stand on both sides of a street near the Gateway Arch as they take part in a protest in favor of reproductive rights Thursday, May 30, 2019, in St. Louis.
