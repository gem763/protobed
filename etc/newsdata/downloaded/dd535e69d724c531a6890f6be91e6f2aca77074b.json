Sure it\u2019s not great, but after all the pain England have suffered because of disgraceful decisions and cheating at tournaments over the years there would be something sweet about winning the Euros because of a dodgy penalty.\n\nAnd anyway, is what Vardy is doing such a terrible thing? He\u2019s running full pace, puts his body between the defender and the ball and goes over when contact is made. Is it such a big deal? Is he pretending to be injured? No. He\u2019s just giving his team the best chance to win the game and he\u2019s prepared to put his own personal reputation on the line for that. I admire that commitment.\n\nEngland's Jamie Vardy looks to German referee Deniz Aytekin after being brought down in the penalty area\n\nI\u2019ll highlight my own dilemma on this issue first though: my heart wants England to win at all costs. Win the European Championship, or stay on your feet in the box for the good of the game? You can send that moral high horse to the knackers yard,\n\nI want to see England lift the trophy. I don\u2019t want some UEFA prat ruffling England\u2019s football hair and saying how well we\u2019ve done to win the Fair Play Award. I don\u2019t want to end up being one of those vegetarians who constantly craves a bacon sandwich thank you.\n\nSo if it\u2019s a straight debate about diving then of course it\u2019s a bad thing. The reality is that we will never eliminate it from the game, so we just have to deal with it. The subsequent question is this: do we want England to be the only ones upholding the moral fortitude of the game while everyone else incorporates falling over into their game and benefits from it? Seems ridiculous when you look at it like that.\n\nI grew up in a house that only had a black and white TV. Cost was prohibitive, but my mum used to say she preferred black and white to colour TV. It made absolutely no sense whatsoever, especially when I was watching snooker. It was a generation thing: she was a woman unable to grasp modern day realities. Like those who long for vinyl, or who only use their mobile for phone calls. They\u2019re limiting themselves unnecessarily.\n\nThe 29-year-old falls to the ground following a challenge from the Turkish defensive midfielder\n\nSo England need to embrace gamesmanship, cheating, the dark arts, whatever you want to call it.\n\nLike the USA did when they roped in a complete and utter foreigner to score their winning goal against England in the 1950 World Cup. Joe Gaetjens was born in Haiti, and played for Haiti. But in his twenties he washed dishes in New York, which somehow qualified him for the USA side. He was never ever a USA citizen, and in fact played for Haiti again three years later.\n\nIn 1986 Diego Maradona punched the ball into the back of the net to beat England, but two games later it was forgotten and he was hailed as the best player in the world as Argentina lifted the World Cup.\n\nVardy (left) goes to the ground following a collision with Arsenal's Nacho Monreal which results in a penalty\n\nIn the same quarter final, Gary Lineker had a great chance to equalise but allowed a defender to clear. Lineker should have used any part of his body to make absolutely sure that ball hit the back of the net \u2013 even if it meant punching the ball in.\n\nLineker was a terrific striker, but instead of being remembered as a World Cup winner, he\u2019s remembered as a player who never got booked. Like anyone cares. I would have been much happier had he cheated and equalised.\n\nItalia 90, the Germans get Gazza booked by rolling around. In 1998 Argentina make sure David Beckham\u2019s stupidity is punished with red by crying and pretending to be injured.\n\nVardy (left) collides in the penalty area with West Ham's Angelo Ogbonna and receives a second yellow card\n\nGermany 2006 the winker Cristiano Ronaldo ensured Wayne Rooney sees red in the quarter finals of the World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa 2010 the Germans carry on despite knowing full well Frank Lampard\u2019s effort crossed the line (if only they had the class of Arsene Wenger \u2013 remember when he offered to replay that Cup tie with Sheffield United in 1999? That was the right and proper course of action).\n\nMost of the time England have been useless in tournaments, but there is a clear pattern of England being cheated out of World Cups, and all we ever do is roll over and take it.\n\nI\u2019m an England fan, and I don\u2019t like diving and cheating, but if that\u2019s what others are doing, then that\u2019s what we need to do. Otherwise the rest of the football world will laugh at us. Again. Keep on doing what you\u2019re doing Jamie Vardy.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo winked at Portugal bench after Wayne Rooney was sent off in 2006 World Cup quarter-final\n\nDavid Beckham was sent off as England were beaten on penalties by Argentina at 1998 World Cup in France", "description": "ADRIAN DURHAM: Cheating isn\u2019t great, diving isn\u2019t a positive for the game, but it happens, and so it puzzles me why people bang on and on about Jamie Vardy \u2018winning\u2019 penalties.", "authors": ["Adrian Durham For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/05/23/22/347F81AE00000578-0-image-a-5_1464040376537.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-24"}
