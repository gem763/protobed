But both British Airways and Ryanair had direct flights the following day. The airline made no effort to book them on one of those services.\n\nAll European airlines are required to provide accommodation for stranded passengers. But easyJet declined to do so \u2013 even though Nice is a major hub for the airline, with hundreds of hotels nearby.\n\nInstead easyJet told passengers: \u201cWe're very sorry but due to extremely high demand at the moment in Nice, we're unable to find a room for you. Our staff will do everything they can to make your wait in the terminal building as comfortable as possible.\u201d\n\nNot knowing the area, the four were unable to find rooms. \u201cWe spent the night sitting outside Nice railway station,\u201d said Ingrid Foster. \u201cWe were abandoned by easyJet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got the train back next morning at great expense: TGV from Nice to Paris, Eurostar from Paris to London and finally a train London back to Grantham.\u201d\n\nThe family spent \u00a31,498 on tickets and other expenses and submitted a \u201ccomprehensive and detailed claim\u201d through the post to easyJet\u2019s head office.\n\nAfter hearing nothing for three weeks, Ms Foster called the airline. \u201cAfter a half hour on hold, I was told they were not able to trace our claim as we had not done it online though the website.\u201d\n\nShe then uploaded all the required information, including the receipts from train bookings. The rail journey alone had cost them over \u00a31,400.\n\nSome days later, easyJet said that her claim had been \u201cfinalised\u201d and promised a payment of \u00a346.92 \u2013 covering some (but not all) of the meals they had had to buy on the journey.\n\nA note added: \u201cIn order for me to proceed further with your claim I need to understand how you travelled to your final destination.\u201d\n\nMs Foster said: \u201cI am not sure what they require as I sent the Trainline receipts.\u201d\n\nAfter The Independent intervened, easyJet sent Ms Foster an email saying: \u201cAs a gesture of goodwill, I would like to reimburse the cost of all your expenses in the form of a bank transfer.\u201d\n\nYet the airline said it was paying only \u20ac100 (\u00a389), leaving them \u00a31,400 out of pocket.\n\nWhen The Independent intervened for a second time, the full claim was paid.\n\nA spokesperson for easyJet said: \u201c\u201cWe are sorry Ms Foster\u2019s flight from Nice to Stansted was cancelled because of air traffic control restrictions caused by adverse weather.\n\n\u201cThis meant the crew due to operate the flight reached their maximum legal operating hours and our standby crew had already been utilised.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately because of a shortage of hotel availability in the area, we asked passengers to make their own arrangements for accommodation and meals and we would reimburse costs.\n\n\u201cBecause alternative transport options were also in short supply we advised passengers that should they make their own arrangements, they would be reimbursed.\n\n\u201cWe would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to her as a result of the disruption and the wait she has faced in settling her expenses. We advise passengers to submit their receipts online.\u201d\n\nBut easyJet said it was not obliged to pay cash compensation for the cancellation. The airline told Ms Foster the grounding was necessary to \u201creduce our programme to minimise the amount of disrupted flights\u201d.\n\nOut of 212 departures from Nice on 10 August on dozens of airlines, only three were cancelled: all on easyJet, to Gatwick, Luton and Stansted.", "description": "After easyJet cancelled the last flight of the night from Nice, a family had to spend the night outside the city\u2019s train station and pay\u00a0almost \u00a31,500 for\u00a0a long train journey home.
