Based on pledges so far \u201cwe are not there\u201d, Macron told delegates.\n\n\u201cThe funds that are being asked of us are not\u2026 charity. It is a decision to invest against injustice,\u201d said the president, highlighting the disproportionate rate of infection and deaths from AIDS, TB and malaria in poor countries, and among women and girls.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do is to make AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria disappear from the face of the Earth,\u201d he added to applause, and announced that France, the fund\u2019s number-two donor, will boost its own contribution by 15 percent.\n\n\u201cThe multilateral system is tired,\u201d Macron lamented.\n\nHe complained that resolve has weakened in many rich donor countries given that fewer people there are dying of the three diseases and that treatment, particularly for HIV, was readily available.\n\nBut they remained rampant in the developing world. \u201cThere is a risk of slackening,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Fund says $14 billion would help save 16 million lives and avert 234 million new infections.\n\nAccording to the UN\u2019s World Health Organization, 770,000 people died of HIV-related causes last year. Tuberculosis, a high risk for HIV-positive people, claimed some 1.7 million lives in 2017, and malaria more than 430,000.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Step up or slip back?\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe meeting is the sixth to replenish the fund since it was set up in 2002, with prominent supporters including Microsoft founder Bill Gates and U2 lead singer Bono in attendance alongside a number of African heads of state.\n\nBut officials said collecting such a large sum could prove challenging, especially as global attention moves from AIDS towards fighting climate change.\n\nAnything more than the $12.2 billion pledged at the fund\u2019s last meeting three years ago in Montreal \u201cwill be considered a success\u201d, said an official in the French presidency.\n\nMacron, however, insisted Thursday that $14 billion \u201cis the minimum\u201d, and warned: \u201cI will not allow anyone to leave this room, nor Lyon, until the $14 billion has been obtained.\u201d\n\nNGOs insist even more is needed \u2014 as much as $18 billion.\n\nPeter Sands, executive director of the Fund, warned delegates on Wednesday that the world was at a crossroads: \u201cDo we step up or do we slip back against adversaries as formidable as HIV, TB and malaria? There is no middle ground. We\u2019re either winning or losing.\u201d\n\n\u2013 \u2018Less not acceptable\u2019 \u2013\n\nThe US is the number one donor with a $4.68 billion contribution to this replenishment voted by Congress.\n\nThe Fund is seeking $1 billion of the total from the business world.\n\n\u201cNo amount less than $14 billion will be acceptable,\u201d the AIDES and Coalition PLUS NGOs said in a statement, which had urged France to ramp up its contribution by a quarter.\n\n\u201cWe are here to remember that behind this financial bargaining there are human lives,\u201d said AIDES president Aurelien Beaucamp.\n\nThe Global Fund groups states, NGOs and private firms to support public health programmes around the world, investing about $4 billion every year.\n\nIt says it has helped save 32 million lives and provided prevention, treatment and care services to hundreds of millions of people, while the yearly number of deaths caused by AIDS, TB and malaria has been slashed by 40 percent since 2002 in countries where the Fund invests.\n\nbur-fga-jri-ppy/mlr/sjw/jh", "description": "Lyon (AFP) \u2013 French President Emmanuel Macron urged donor nations Thursday to replenish the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/aa5886_president-emmanuel-macron-france-increase-by-15-percent-its-contribution-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
