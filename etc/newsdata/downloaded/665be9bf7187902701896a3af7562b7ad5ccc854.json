REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), in long-awaited interim conclusions from a study launched a year ago into how car and home insurers treat customers, said on Friday firms use complex pricing practices that allow them to raise prices for consumers that renew with them year on year, known as \u201cprice walking\u201d.\n\n\u201cRemedies are inevitable,\u201d Christopher Woolard, the watchdog\u2019s executive director for competition, told reporters.\n\n\u201cWhether those are remedies imposed through FCA rules, to some extent is up to industry. They can be remedies that are agreed on a voluntary basis,\u201d Woolard added.\n\nThe watchdog is not interested in extended dialogue with insurers over changes, Woolard said.\n\n\u201cThe ball is now very much in the hands of the industry.\u201d\n\nThe Association of British Insurers said it agreed home and motor insurance markets could work better for customers who do not shop around at renewal, and that it would work with the regulator on the issue.\n\nSix million car and home insurance policyholders paid high prices in 2018 in the 18 billion pound ($22 billion) market, the watchdog said. If they had paid the average price for a policy, they would collectively have saved 1.2 billion pounds.\n\nThis includes one in three people whose financial position is potentially vulnerable.\n\n\u201cIt is shocking that insurance firms have got away with increasing prices for those customers who are least able to switch,\u201d said Helen Undy, chief executive of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute.\n\nThe FCA is considering curbs on firms charging higher prices to consumers who do not switch, for example, by restricting or banning \u201cmargin optimisation\u201d based on consumers\u2019 likelihood of renewing.\n\nJPMorgan Cazenove analysts said the FCA scrutiny would \u201cact as an overhang\u201d on general insurers, highlighting Direct Line (DLGD.L), Saga (SAGAG.L), and Admiral as most at risk.\n\nShares in Saga, which offers insurance and travel to the over-50s, tumbled as much as 11% after the watchdog announced its proposals, before recouping some losses. Direct Line Insurance, Aviva (AV.L) and Hastings (HSTG.L) also dropped.\n\n\u201cAt the moment these are just proposals. The FCA must now follow through on these bold ideas to stop loyal insurance customers being penalized,\u201d said Gillian Guy, chief executive of consumer group Citizens Advice.\n\nCiti analysts said the report was \u201cfrustratingly light on actual suggestions and is more of a rehash of the options ... available\u201d.\n\nInsurers have already been drawing up new policies on how to deal with vulnerable customers, one industry source said.\n\nMore than 45 million home and motor insurance policies were written in 2018, and home and motor insurance generated 18 billion pounds in gross premiums last year. The FCA said 82% of adults in Britain have at least one general insurance policy.\n\nIt plans to publish a final report and consultation on remedies in the first quarter of next year.\n\nWoolard declined to comment on potential enforcement action.\n\n\u201cThere is no suggestion in this of an industry that has been breaching rules on a wholesale basis,\u201d he said.", "description": "Britain's markets watchdog threw down the gauntlet to car and home insurers on Friday, saying they could avoid mandatory pricing restrictions if they voluntarily stop penalizing loyal customers.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436946779&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930KA", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
