But that\u2019s precisely the point. In the culture war that currently cleaves America, there are three sides. There are progressives who believe that racism, nativism, and misogyny powered Donald Trump\u2019s rise and must be defeated. There are conservatives who believe that Trump\u2019s election was a response to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d\u2014the left\u2019s effort to demonize as bigoted anyone who defends the traditions that made America great. And there\u2019s a third group that thinks it\u2019s all a dangerous distraction, a fight over where to place the chaise longues on the Titanic. What\u2019s killing America, this camp argues, is bad economics; treat that and the identity hatreds will fade. Over the past quarter century, two presidential candidates have mobilized these economics-first, culture-war-indifferent voters into a potent force. The first was Ross Perot. The second is Andrew Yang.\n\nWhen Perot died this summer, many commentators described him as the precursor to Donald Trump. But while there are obvious similarities between these two egomaniacal protectionist businessmen, they differed in at least one crucial way. Trump\u2014like George Wallace and Pat Buchanan before him\u2014built his political career on racism. He launched his presidential campaign with a tirade against Mexican immigrants. In the 2018 midterms, Trump made the migrant \u201ccaravan\u201d the centerpiece of his campaign strategy, even as allies begged him to talk about the strong economy.\n\nIn 1992, Perot did the opposite. He tried to avoid the culture war, which he saw as a distraction from America\u2019s economic woes. Perot, The Washington Post\u2019s obituary recalled, was \u201cevasive on gun control.\u201d While personally pro-choice, he said that when it came to abortion, \u201cthe people are ready and willing to put [past] divisions behind us.\u201d In general, the Post noted, Perot \u201csaw little role for a president on such [culture war] issues, saying they mostly should be left to the states.\u201d He \u201cunderstands the mounting public frustration at how the social issues, especially abortion, have tended to dominate the economic issues that many consider the federal government\u2019s primary responsibility,\u201d noted a 1993 essay in The New Republic.\n\nInstead, Perot focused obsessively on economic mismanagement\u2014a rubric that covered trade deals such as NAFTA and, above all, the national debt. While the Cold War had ended, he declared, \u201canother war is upon us. In this new war, the enemy is not the red flag of Communism, but the red ink of our national debt.\u201d The New York Times observed, \u201cThe difference between Mr. Perot's specificity on deficit reduction and his tentativeness in other areas reflects the importance he assigns to economic issues.\u201d An adviser admitted that Perot \u201cnever really formulated positions on what he considered the secondary issues, which was basically everything other than the economy.\"", "description": "Like Ross Perot, the Democratic businessman downplays social issues and focuses on economics\u2014the perfect formula for some disaffected voters.", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Professor Of Journalism At The City University Of New York"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX739CU/facebook.jpg?1568927226", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
