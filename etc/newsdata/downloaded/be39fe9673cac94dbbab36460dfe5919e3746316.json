Shape Created with Sketch. 11 of Meghan Markle's best feminist quotes 1/11 On stigma around menstruation and female education 'Imagine a world where the female leaders we revere never achieved their full potential because they dropped out of school at the age of thirteen. In the western world this is challenging to fathom, but for millions of young women globally, this remains their harsh reality for a staggering reason. From sub-Saharan Africa to India, Iran, and several other countries, the stigma surrounding menstruation and lack of access to proper sanitation directly inhibit young women from pursuing an education.' (Time, 2017) Getty Images 2/11 On the #MeToo and Time's Up movements 'I hear a lot of people saying when speaking about girls\u2019 empowerment, finding and knowing their worth, or women\u2019s empowerment as well, you will often hear people say: \"You\u2019re helping women find their voices.\" And I fundamentally disagree with that, because women don\u2019t need to find the voice \u2013 they have a voice, they need to be empowered to use it and people need to be encouraged to listen. And I think right now in the climate that we\u2019re seeing with so many campaigns, with #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up, there is no better time than to really continue to shine a light on women feeling empowered and people really helping to support them, men included in that.' (The Royal Foundation Forum, 2018) Getty Images 3/11 On gender stereotypes in cleaning adverts 'I don\u2019t think it is right for kids to grow up thinking these things, that just mum does everything.' (At 11 years old on Nick News, 1993) Getty Images 4/11 On supporting women's voices 'Women make up more than half of the world\u2019s population and potential, so it is neither just nor practical for their voices, for our voices, to go unheard at the highest levels of decision-making. The way that we change that, in my opinion, is to mobilize girls and women to see their value as leaders, and to support them in these efforts.' (UN Women Conference, 2015) Getty Images 5/11 On women's suffrage 'Women\u2019s suffrage is about feminism, but feminism is about fairness. Suffrage is not simply about the right to vote, but also about what that represents: the basic and fundamental human right of being able to participate in the choices for your future and that of your community.' (At Government House in New Zealand for 125th anniversary of women achieving right to vote in country, 2018) Getty Images 6/11 On dressing like a feminist 'You don\u2019t have to play dress up to be a feminist. You are a feminist exactly the way you are. You can be a woman who wants to look good and still stand up for the equality of women. There\u2019s no uniform for feminism; you are a feminist exactly the way you are.' (Create and Cultivate, 2016) Getty Images 7/11 On knowing your value 'I think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office, at home, or anywhere you go is just knowing your value.' (InStyle, 2015) Getty Images 8/11 On taking action to achieve equality 'It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision \u2013 because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together. Starting now.' (UN Women Conference, 2015) Getty Images 9/11 On looking after yourself 'Be kind to yourself. Truly, if we treated ourselves as well as we treated our best friends we would be a million miles ahead of the game.

And, if I'm lucky enough, to inspire.' (Elle, 2016) Getty Images 11/11 On what it means to be a feminist \u2018No matter what you look like, you should be taken seriously.

To embrace both.\u2019 (Interview with Larry King, 2016)\n\nThe comments mark the first time that the Duchess has addressed being a woman of colour since she married Prince Harry in 2018.\n\nThe former actor has spoken out about the difficulties involved with being categorised as \u201cethnically ambiguous\u201d in the past. In 2017, Markle explained that casting directors were often confused, wondering whether she was \u201cLatina\u201d, \u201cSephardic\u201d or \u201cexotic Caucasian\u201d.\n\nDuring her speech in Cape Town, the 38-year-old also spoke about her strong stance on feminism, sharing a quote from American poet Maya Angelou.\n\n\u201cEach time a woman stands up for herself, without knowing it possibly, without claiming it, she stands up for all women,\" Markle said.\n\nThe duchess later thanked some of the teenage girls she and Prince Harry had spoken to earlier in the day for being so \u201copen and honest\u201d about the dangers women face in Africa and how they are tackling them.\n\n\u201cThe rights of women and girls is something that's very close to my heart and a cause I've spent the majority of my life advocating for, because I know that when women are empowered, the entire community flourishes,\u201d Markle added.\n\n\u201dPlease know that my husband and I have been closely following what you've been experiencing here, as best as we can from afar. Everything that is being done on the ground is making the great change that you not only need but that you deserve\u201c.\n\nPrince Harry also told the women and girls present: \"No man is born to cause harm to women. This is learned behaviour and we need to break that cycle.\"\n\nEarlier this month, campaigners took to the streets of Cape Town following a series of attacks to protest at what they claimed was their government's failure to deal with the problem of violence against women\n\nThe duchess is an active humanitarian campaigner, particularly on the topic of gender equality, who has spoken about women's empowerment many times.\n\nMarkle\u2019s activism famously started at a young age. At just 11-years-old she forced a soap manufacturer to alter an advert after she wrote a letter to the then first lady Hillary Clinton and other high-profile figures complaining that it implied women belonged in the kitchen.", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex has publicly spoken about her position in the world as a \u201cwoman of colour'' during a powerful speech about female empowerment.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/14/meghan-markle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
