After coming out of an 18-month retirement to make his UFC run earlier this year, the goal for Askren was to become champion. The third-round submission defeat to Maia in the welterweight headliner at Singapore Indoor Stadium put that goal out of reach for the time being, and it will take tremendous effort to get that position back.\n\n\u201cIf I beat Demian Maia I\u2019m probably one more good win away from a title shot,\u201d Askren said on \u201cAriel Helwani\u2019s MMA Show\u201d. \u201cNow I look at my path, and I\u2019m like \u2018Oh (expletive).\u2019 I\u2019m kind of far away. Fortunes can change fast, but it\u2019s probably minimum, minimum three fights. It could be upwards of four or five. Who knows? I don\u2019t need to prove I\u2019m a good fighter. I don\u2019t need more money. I don\u2019t need to be more famous. I don\u2019t really want any of those things that badly. What I wanted to do was prove I\u2019m the best in the world, and now I\u2019m looking at how far away that is and how long it\u2019s going to take me to get there and trying to weigh all that out.\u201d\n\nAfter suffering a five-second knockout loss to Jorge Masvidal in July at UFC 239 in what was his first career defeat, Askren returned for the matchup against Maia, who is a fellow grappler. Askren said he felt he was doing well before making an error that allowed Maia to sink in a fight-ending rear-naked choke in the third round.\n\nAskren said the result didn\u2019t make him feel as if he can\u2019t compete with the top 170-pound fighters on the UFC roster. He thinks he\u2019s capable of beating anyone on the right day, but he must make a decision of whether he wants to find out. At 35 and with plenty of ventures outside of MMA, Askren is torn over whether to start his post-fighting life now or delay retirement in favor of more fights.\n\n\u201cRetirement is definitely something I am considering,\u201d Askren said. \u201cI would be lying to you if I said I was not. It\u2019s just a time-cost analysis. I have a lot of things to do in my life. I\u2019m a really busy guy. I have a lot of things I\u2019m passionate about, and I love. Not training specifically, but to and from setting stuff up, I\u2019m probably spending about 30 hours a week on MMA related stuff. \u2018Can I place my time better somewhere else\u2019 is definitely a thought process that\u2019s crossed my mind.\n\n\u201cThat being said, two more things: All I ever wanted was an opportunity. That\u2019s all I ever wanted. I got my opportunity, so it would be hard to be bitter or disgruntled in any way because I had the opportunity I wanted. I wasn\u2019t able to execute on that opportunity, and that\u2019s on me. That is kind of one thought process. Then the other thought process is part of me wants to fight more. I thought I was doing really well in the Demian Maia fight.\u201d\n\nAskren said he won\u2019t rush into making a decision about his future. He will discuss all the positives and negatives with his inner circle then wait to see what opportunities the UFC presents.\n\n\u201cI would say my feelings are very, very mixed,\u201d Askren said. \u201cThere\u2019s parts of me that say, \u2018Yeah, of course I want to fight some more. I think I can still compete with the best guys in the world.\u2019 I\u2019ve beaten some of the best guys in the world. Douglas Lima, I was really happy to see him get some credit this weekend after beating Rory MacDonald, because I think he\u2019s fantastic. Part of me says, \u2018Man, I\u2019ve got a lot of things I want to do with my life, so I need to get to getting.'\u201d", "description": "Ben Askren explains why retirement is a serious option for him after losing to Demian Maia at UFC on ESPN+ 20.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "Matt Erickson", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ben-askren-ufc-singapore-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
