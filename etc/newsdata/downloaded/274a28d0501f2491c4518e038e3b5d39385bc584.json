Gen. Michael Flynn, specializes in unearthing stashed evidence and prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nShe came to fame in the Enron scandal in Texas and then wrote a book about how corrupt she believes the U.S. Justice Department is.\n\nToday, Ms. Powell is causing headlines in the conservative press and being cheered on by pro-Trump forces as she files motions in U.S. District Court depicting special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe as part of that corruption.\n\n\u201cSidney is a smart and tough lawyer who demands that the prosecution play by the rules,\u201d Tom Kirkendall, a House attorney and veteran of the Enron wars, told The Washington Times.\n\nMs. Powell faces a stiff test: It would be unusual for a judge to throw out a case after a defendant has pleaded guilty. She accuses the Obama Justice Department and the FBI of ambushing an unprepared Flynn at the White House. She says prosecutors withheld favorable evidence in his December 2017 guilty plea to lying to two FBI agents, one of whom is Peter Strzok, a detractor of President Trump.\n\nShe is putting the Trump-Russia saga on trial through court briefs that demand evidence on critical players such as Christopher Steele, the Hillary Clinton opposition research agent who went to the Kremlin to publish bogus charges against candidate Trump. She also wants a fuller picture of Joseph Mifsud, the Maltese professor who ingratiated himself to a Trump campaign adviser in London.\n\nFlynn prosecutor Brandon L. Van Grack, a former Mueller team lawyer, has submitted replies denying all of this. He says no evidence that bears on Flynn\u2019s guilty plea remains hidden, and he calls Ms. Powell\u2019s writings \u201cconspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nU.S. Judge Emmet G. Sullivan announced this week that he plans to make a ruling based on written filings.\n\nNext to the prosecution of Flynn, who once held the lofty titles of Defense Intelligence Agency director and White House national security adviser, Ms. Powell\u2019s most infamous case was the Enron energy scandal of the early to mid-2000s.\n\nShe entered the fray as an appeals specialist. She eventually acquired long-hidden Justice Department prosecution files that showed evidence had been withheld at trial from defense attorneys.\n\nEnron\u2019s chief prosecutor for a time was Andrew Weissmann, who eventually came to head the Justice Department\u2019s fraud division. From there, Mr. Mueller, his old boss at the FBI, pulled him into the Trump-Russia investigation. Mr. Weissmann was one of a number of Democratic Party-aligned lawyers recruited by Mr. Mueller.\n\nMs. Powell filed ethics complaints against Mr. Weissmann. A New York regulatory lawyer rejected them though agreed that evidence was withheld in the Enron-related trial of Merrill Lynch executives.\n\nMs. Powell represented one of five Merrill Lynch traders who went to prison in the so-called Nigerian barge case, in which Enron sold a power-producing barge to Merrill Lynch supposedly to hide misdealings in 1999.\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit reversed all fraud convictions in the case but left Ms. Powell\u2019s client with a perjury conviction. The appellate judges said Mr. Weissmann\u2019s theory of the illegality of the traders\u2019 actions was flawed.\n\nWhat defense attorneys didn\u2019t know then was the existence of favorable witness statements that the Weissmann team never shared. Ms. Powell told The Times in 2017 that prosecutors even yellow-highlighted the favorable information they withheld.\n\n\u201cThe summaries were false,\u201d William Hodes, an authority on lawyer ethics, told The Times in 2017. \u201cThey said things that the witnesses did not say. They themselves yellow-highlighted what they left out of the summaries. It\u2019s astonishing. We should have gotten a new trial.\u201d\n\nMr. Hodes has joined the Flynn defense team.\n\n\u201cAll of the cases Weissmann pushed to trial were reversed in whole or in part due to some form of his overreaching and abuses,\u201d Ms. Powell told The Times.\n\nTrapping Flynn\n\nMs. Powell is applying her Enron lessons to the battle to cleanse the Flynn conviction.\n\nJust like with the Enron case, she is sure there are Justice files that show the retired general is a victim of overzealous G-men and prosecutors.\n\nFlynn pleaded guilty as Mr. Mueller\u2019s agents were eying his son, Michael Flynn Jr., for prosecution on an illegal lobbying charge. At the same time, Flynn faced legal bills of more than $1 million from his previous legal team, forcing him to sell his home.\n\nFlynn did not know the extent to which Mr. Strzok despised Mr. Trump until after he pleaded guilty. Then, on a Saturday, news of messages between Mr. Strzok and his FBI girlfriend leaked. Mr. Strzok had been fired from the Mueller team for bias months earlier.\n\nFlynn also didn\u2019t know that the FBI plotted to keep him away from counsel, something former Director James B. Comey bragged about at a public appearance. The agents surprised him with questions at the White House about his calls with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.\n\nThe agents went to the White House on Mr. Comey\u2019s orders to investigate whether Flynn violated the rarely prosecuted Logan Act of 1799. It prohibits private citizens from dabbling in foreign affairs. Outgoing Obama appointees inside Justice raised the Logan Act with regard to Flynn.\n\nThe agents owned an intercept transcript and knew exactly what Flynn discussed regarding Obama-imposed sanctions against Russia. Flynn told the agents he didn\u2019t remember everything he talked about with Mr. Kislyak but said he didn\u2019t bring up sanctions \u2014 a lie.\n\n\u201cIn this case, high-ranking FBI officials orchestrated an ambush-interview of the new president\u2019s National Security Advisor, not for the purpose of discovering any evidence of criminal activity \u2014 they already had tapes of all the relevant conversations about which they questioned Mr. Flynn \u2014 but for the purpose of trapping him into making statements they could allege as false,\u201d Ms. Powell said.\n\nShe said in her latest brief that agents edited their Form 302 interview reports to make Flynn seem more guilty.\n\nIn the air during all of Flynn\u2019s travails was that he was a \u201cRussian agent.\u201d The media reports partly stemmed from his appearance on RT, Russian-state TV, and attended an RT dinner in Moscow, where he sat with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\u201cThe FBI and DOJ wrote an internal memo dated January 30, 2017, exonerating Mr. Flynn of acting as an \u2018agent of Russia;\u2019 and, they all knew there was no Logan Act violation,\u201d Ms. Powell wrote in an Oct. 24 filing. \u201cThe government owes Mr. Flynn the full versions of these exculpatory statements. He has been smeared as being an agent of a foreign government for several years now.\u201d\n\nJudge Sullivan has scheduled a December sentencing. The prosecution is not recommending jail time.\n\nFlynn\u2019s guilty plea brought widespread media speculation that he would turn against the president and implicate him in a Russia election conspiracy. But Flynn did not.\n\nNo Trump associate was charged in any Russia conspiracy, which Mr. Mueller said his probe did not establish.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
