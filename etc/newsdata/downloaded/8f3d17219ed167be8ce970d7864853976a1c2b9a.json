Against a backdrop of silver streamers and placards from the pro-choice rally that has just taken place, a small crowd gathers as Sister Ghost blast out a rendition of Nirvana\u2019s Love Buzz. Vocalist Shannon Delores O\u2019Neill sings in impassioned yelps, continually falling to her knees, eyes closed, and dropping the microphone at the end of the song. Nirvana played the track at the first ever Rock for Choice benefit in Hollywood, California, in 1991. Sister Ghost are performing it at a fundraiser for the same cause.\n\nAmid the threat posed by Brexit, civil rights struggles and a paramilitary resurgence, the political situation in Northern Ireland remains fragile. The country is gasping in a political vacuum without a functioning government since 2017, after disagreements between the two main parties, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F\u00e9in, signalled the end of their power-sharing agreement. The killing of journalist Lyra McKee in April (for which the New IRA has admitted responsibility) and the attacks on police in Fermanagh and Craigavon suggest that slipping back into pre-1998 chaos is not a distant danger.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gender Chores. Photograph: Nance Hall\n\nMany Northern Irish musicians are channelling their anger through song. And the central target has become the DUP, the rightwing, pro-Union, Eurosceptic party who have consistently blocked equal marriage legislation and abortion reform.\n\nAt Rock for Choice, subtlety is not in the vocabulary of the feminist punk outfit Gender Chores. Their sound is fast, loud and angry; their unrelenting basslines and hard-edged melodies are imbued with anti-patriarchy lyrics yelled with an unmistakable Ulster cadence. Following their late-afternoon slot, the band chat animatedly with the other acts. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in dancing around it, you may as well just say what you\u2019re going to say,\u201d declares lead vocalist Samantha McCann, with pro-choice slogan The North Is Now written across her thighs and exposed through ripped fishnet tights. \u201cWe are driven by frustration more than anything else. We\u2019re writing about issues that affect us and we\u2019re singing to an audience also affected by those issues.\u201d\n\nFrom traditional rebel songs to the fiery Belfast punk scene of the 70s, for decades music has been a way to voice discontent in the region. Stiff Little Fingers called for an Alternative Ulster in 1978: did these bands think people would still be shouting about it 41 years later? \u201cWe definitely wouldn\u2019t have the opportunities we have if bands like the Undertones and Rudi hadn\u2019t paved the way for us,\u201d says Gender Chores drummer AJ Mawhinney. \u201cIt\u2019s important to carry that on with a modern twist given what\u2019s going on now.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve seen our friends affected firsthand by legislation in Northern Ireland denying LGBT rights Gareth Murray, Hand Models\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the local music scene, we\u2019re all quite political anyway, so the role comes quite naturally,\u201d McCann says. \u201cWe show up to protests, sign petitions and take part in grassroots movements.\u201d For Mawhinney, Northern Ireland\u2019s situation makes cheap fuel for punk\u2019s fire: \u201cWe\u2019re surrounded by a lot of political turmoil at the moment, so the songs almost write themselves. We are three angry people and there\u2019s just a wealth of material here. Bands that sing about topics like abortion and marriage equality are kind of CC-ing the DUP, even if they\u2019re not explicitly saying it.\u201d\n\nGender Chores are not a band to mince their message. Legisl8, a song about the rights dictated by the DUP, calls out the party\u2019s leader Arlene Foster with a rather moving play on words: \u201cFoster love and lose the hate / Foster, love and legislate.\u201d The title track of the band\u2019s EP Womansplaining declares: \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear your thoughts / On women\u2019s rights and Brexit talks.\u201d The cover depicts the members sprawled against the currently empty Northern Irish Assembly building Stormont; the inner cover notes the number of days Northern Ireland has been without government at the time of its release.\n\nSome of the most angry songs about the DUP come from artists who do not usually make political work. The folk songwriter Joshua Burnside isn\u2019t inclined to screaming, punk-style protest. His song Red and White Blues, taking its name from the loyalist tradition of painting kerbstones during the summer bonfire season, reflects on his experience growing up with staunch loyalist family members, including a grandfather in the DUP. \u201cIt protests a mentality of \u2018them and us\u2019 and political tribalism, harnessing culture for divisive purposes,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people in my own family who would disagree with some of the sentiments.\u201d But \u201ceven if you change one person\u2019s way of thinking about a political situation or dynamic, then that\u2019s an enormous achievement. But it\u2019s not something I really focus on; your politics just comes out naturally in your music.\u201d\n\nFor Belfast teenagers, punk meant far more than just mohicans and safety pins Read more\n\nLikewise, garage rockers Hand Models\u2019 song Last Leaves on a Tree was not written with the intention of being a protest, but the final chorus erupts into surprise chants of \u201cFuck the DUP!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen our friends affected firsthand by legislation in Northern Ireland denying LGBT rights,\u201d explains frontman Gareth Murray. The track details one man\u2019s relocation to Dublin to find himself a husband and avoid \u201cbreaking a civil law\u201d in a place where same-sex marriage is banned. The song is inspired by the true story of a friend of Pete Devine, the band\u2019s lyricist.\n\n\u201cSeeing the real-life scenarios that it creates, it felt like a very relevant subject for us to address,\u201d Murray continues. \u201cThe song is more for the sake of people being able to find joy in a time when basic human rights are being rejected due to the uneducated, stubborn beliefs of people in power. Music has always been an integral part of bringing people together to voice change; it allows passion for social justice to exist on a much broader scale.\u201d\n\nHaving been dubbed everything from \u201cunnatural\u201d to \u201can abomination\u201d by the DUP\u2019s elected members, it\u2019s easy to see why so many queer musicians in Northern Ireland feel compelled to speak out. Strange New Places, a majority transgender band formed across the six counties, view their platform as a responsibility to agitate for progressive rights. \u201cIt\u2019s always going to be nervewracking to be openly queer in a homophobic society,\u201d says lead singer Ashley. \u201cPerformance makes you vulnerable by putting you out there, but in some ways, it\u2019s easier to be loud on a stage in a space that you\u2019ve made sure is safe.\u201d\n\nAs the closing act at Rock for Choice, Strange New Places\u2019 high-energy set does not disappoint, marrying pop-rock riffs, shimmering synths and candid lyrics. With the venue at near capacity, the crowd gathers closely around the makeshift stage, dancing and bobbing their heads along with the band. There is a tangible sense of community among audiences at their gigs, and messages of support flood in on Instagram after the show.\n\nAshley feels the personal and the political in Northern Irish music cannot be separated. \u201cThere\u2019s a specific voice we can bring and feel we should bring: fighting against the erasure of trans men and non-binary people in the fight for bodily autonomy.\u201d So often couched in terms of abortion rights, Ashley says this fight is \u201coften referred to as just a women\u2019s issue, which is very damaging for a lot of trans people\u201d. On This City, Strange New Places sing about getting away from their home town, but Ashley is not entirely disheartened: \u201cThere are the conditions in Northern Ireland for people to be pushing hard enough against the brick wall of bigotry that it just crumbles.\u201d\n\nPeople who face oppression make great performers and lyricists because they really do have something to shout about Shannon Delores O'Neill, Sister Ghost\n\nSister Ghost are co-organisers of this Rock for Choice gig, and having shared the stage with such iconic protest acts as Pussy Riot, Shannon Delores O\u2019Neill is no stranger to challenging the government. Seventy miles from Belfast, the impact of Brexit will be felt especially hard in her native Derry. \u201cIn terms of music, a hard border will be devastating for playing shows outside Northern Ireland and vice versa for our friends in the Republic.\u201d She says it will be harder to maintain relationships across the Irish music scene, and that bands will face possible increases in import tax on their merchandise.\n\nDerry\u2019s musical output has always been impressive for its range, from the Undertones\u2019 pop-punk anthem Teenage Kicks to D:Ream\u2019s New Labour anthem Things Can Only Get Better. Rather than mimic the hopeful, upbeat songs of their predecessors, the city\u2019s most recent exports have taken inspiration from the grim political climate. The punk band Touts, whose Troubles-inspired song titles include Bombscare and Political People, have expressed fears about a hard border, living so close to the Republic; fellow Derry rockers the Wood Burning Savages address Brexit on their ironically titled debut album Stability with their brooding, six-minute epic Freedom of Movement.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Strange New Places. Photograph: Rachel Roberts\n\nSister Ghost\u2019s upcoming single, Fake Friends Run This Country, accuses the DUP of human rights violations by abusing their power at Stormont. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that the voices of minorities are heard, especially in these tumultuous times,\u201d O\u2019Neill stresses. \u201cPeople who face oppression make great performers and lyricists because they really do have something to shout about; music and art are vital forms of protest as they allow for a catharsis rarely matched by picketing. A great political song leaves a lasting impression that can inspire others to stand up and speak out.\u201d\n\nTo the delight of activist groups and the chagrin of the DUP, MPs in Westminster have voted to extend equal marriage and abortion legislation to Northern Ireland by 21 October unless the devolved government has been restored by then. The historic vote offers a glimmer of hope. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible time we are living in,\u201d O\u2019Neill reflects, \u201cbut it is a great time to be an impassioned and frustrated artist.\u201d", "description": "With Brexit looming, a dormant government and dissident terror on the rise, these are fertile times for Ulster bands \u2013 with Arlene Foster\u2019s ultra-conservatives the common enemy", "authors": ["Kristen Sinclair"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4783d558ad272de5f05881e7bce909b0d8a9006b/0_4_1646_988/master/1646.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=39b4dbb7d48f9d94bcef65215d343729", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
