Since reports of the phone call have been publicized, Giuliani has taken to cable news to defend himself and his client in rambling \u2014 and at times contradictory \u2014 tirades.\n\nGiuliani told CNN on Thursday that the whistleblower account was \"total nonsense\" and he had \"no knowledge of any of that crap.\"\n\n\u201cRudy Giuliani really ought to stop talking and get a lawyer because, I mean, he is incriminating himself,\u201d Harris said Thursday.\n\nShe also suggested earlier Thursday night on MSNBC: \u201cThe New York bar association needs to investigate Giuliani and probably disbar him.\u201d\n\nHarris also denounced Trump\u2019s response to the reports. The president said on Thursday that he wanted to find out who gave the information to the whistleblower, adding that in the \u201cold days,\u201d \u201cspies and treason\u201d were handled a \u201clittle differently.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe sounds like a criminal,\u201d Harris said on Thursday. \u201cWho snitched? Who gave up the goods? Let\u2019s find out who gave up the goods on us and make sure there\u2019s a consequence and it\u2019s serious, and let that be a lesson to everybody else. And it sounds like it\u2019s straight out of some bad drama.\u201d\n\nReports of the exchange between Trump and Zelensky have prompted deep concern among intelligence officials and led to calls for impeachment from previously skittish Democrats. Harris had already called for Trump\u2019s impeachment in the light of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/e5/36/34aeda3d4f76ad12f5b6162095b1/190926-kamala-harris-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
