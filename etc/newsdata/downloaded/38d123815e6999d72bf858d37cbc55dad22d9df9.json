(Oct. 8) AP, AP\n\nDonald Trump has set his sights on Democratic Minnesota officials over what he sees as efforts to block his re-election rally in Minneapolis. Now, freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are firing back on Twitter.\n\n\"Minnesota stands for peace, equity, and justice -- everything you are against,\" Omar said Tuesday. \"While you spew hate, we will keep fighting for the America we deserve.\"\n\nTrump had criticized the Democratic mayor over security charges for the Thursday campaign event.\n\n\"The radical leftist mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey, is abusing the power of his office and attempting to extort President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign by conjuring a phony and outlandish bill for security in an effort to block a scheduled Keep America Great rally,\" Trump's team said in a campaign email Monday evening.\n\nMore: Police supporters of Trump plan 'sea of red' at Minneapolis rally amid outrage over uniform ban\n\nThe campaign was threatening a lawsuit against the Target Center where the event is set to take place to dispute a $530,000 bill, that was originally passed onto the arena by the city.\n\nThe statement said the Target Center tried to charge the Trump campaign for the bill, and would withhold use of the arena if it wasn't paid, which campaign said would be a breach of contract, adding the Secret Service was responsible for coordinating security.\n\nBut in an update issued Tuesday, the campaign said the Target Center is honoring the original agreement with no additional security charges.\n\nSomeone please tell the Radical Left Mayor of Minneapolis that he can\u2019t price out Free Speech. Probably illegal! I stand strongly & proudly with the great Police Officers and Law Enforcement of Minneapolis and the Great State of Minnesota! See you Thursday Night! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nTrump also brought Omar, whose Congressional district includes Minneapolis, into the spat while slamming a recent policy change barring Minneapolis police officers from attending political rallies in their uniforms while off duty.\n\nThe police department policy was implemented shortly after the Trump campaign announced that a rally would be held in Minneapolis. The department claims the move was an effort to avoid the appearance of political bias. The police department's union president said in response that officers should wear \"Cops for Trump\" T-shirts.\n\n\"The lightweight mayor is hurting the great police and other wonderful supporters. 72,000 ticket requests already. Dump Frey and Omar! Make America Great Again!\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nFrey has said Trump is not welcome in Minneapolis and tweeted back at the president over the security charges for the rally: \"Yawn... Welcome to Minneapolis where we pay our bills, we govern with integrity, and we love all of our neighbors.\"\n\nSomeone tell the President of the United States that he can afford to help pay for the extra time our officers will be putting in while he\u2019s in town. https://t.co/bXITaPdW4E \u2014 Jacob Frey (@Jacob_Frey) October 8, 2019\n\n\"Since taking office President Trump\u2019s actions have been reprehensible and his rhetoric has made it clear that he does not value the perspectives or rights of Minneapolis\u2019 diverse communities,\" Frey said in a statement after the rally was announced.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/08/ilhan-omar-minneapolis-mayor-spar-donald-trump-over-rally/3910795002/", "description": "Donald Trump has set his sights on Minnesota Rep.
