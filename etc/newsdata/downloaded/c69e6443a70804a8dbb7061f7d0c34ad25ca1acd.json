Lagging far behind in polls, the PPC could still split some of the Conservative vote.\n\nJustin Trudeau embraces supporter David Chartrand during a rally in Winnipeg on Saturday. AP\n\n\"This is the kind of dirty politics that confuse Canadians' faith in politics,\" Mr Bernier said at a press conference in Sainte-Marie, Quebec. \"He [Scheer] is ready to steal the election with lies and manipulations.\n\n\"We have already filed a complaint with Elections Canada with our concerns about what the Conservative Party did. We are considering other [legal] avenues.\"\n\nMr Scheer, speaking in Toronto, repeatedly refused to answer questions about the report, saying only: \"We don't make comments on vendors that we may or may not have engaged with.\"\n\nAsked about the story, Mr Trudeau said: \"Conservatives have had to use the politics of fear and division and they just make stuff up.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Nanos Research poll for the Globe and Mail and CTV released on Saturday put the Liberals at 32.6 per cent public support and the Conservatives at 30.3 per cent. The left-leaning New Democrats, who compete for the same voters as the Liberals, were at 18.4 per cent.\n\nMr Trudeau sidestepped questions about his plans if he did not win a majority. Minority governments in Canada rarely last more than 2\u00bd years.\n\nMr Scheer, speaking in Toronto, said Mr Trudeau would spend his first 100 days negotiating a coalition with the New Democrats that would impose tax increases.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau has made it clear he will pay any price to stay in power, and he will use your money to do it,\" he told reporters.\n\nThere has only been one coalition in Canadian history, in 1917 during the First World War.\n\nMr Trudeau and Mr Scheer made multiple trips to Ontario, which accounts for 108 of the 338 seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals hold 76 of those seats.\n\nMr Trudeau was scheduled to make four stops in Ontario before flying later on Saturday to the western provinces of Manitoba and Alberta, where anger against the Liberals is rising over government environmental measures that critics complain will hobble the energy industry.\n\nReuters", "description": "Polls show the Liberals and the Conservatives in a dead heat, with neither able to capture a majority of the 338 seats in the House of Commons.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.363%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_417%2C$y_5/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/40150ec3b09211667a6782a0cafa51544fd12d90", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
