(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) Associated Press\n\nAMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Nate Stanley threw for 201 yards and ran for a score, and No. 19 Iowa made a big fourth-down stop late in the game, allowing the Hawkeyes to beat Iowa State 18-17 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win over the Cyclones.\n\nKeith Duncan kicked four field goals for the Hawkeyes (3-0, 1-0 Big Ten), who also improved to 4-0 against Iowa State coach Matt Campbell in a game delayed nearly 3 hours because of lightning.\n\nTrailing 18-17 in the closing minutes, Iowa State drove to the Iowa 34 before a false start, a slip by quarterback Brock Purdy and an incompletion brought up fourth-and-13. The Cyclones went for it and, after offsetting penalties led to a do-over, Purdy overthrew Deshaunte Jones near the end zone.\n\nThe Cyclones appeared to get another chance when they forced a quick Iowa punt. But the ball hit Datrone Young in the back and Iowa's Devonte Young recovered it, sealing the win for the Hawkeyes.\n\nIowa State (1-1) opened the scoring on a 51-yard double pass from Purdy to Jones \u2014 a converted prep quarterback \u2014 to La'Michael Pettway midway through the first quarter.\n\nThe Cyclones then moved ahead 14-6 just 57 seconds into the second half on a 73-yard strike from Purdy to Tarique Milton, who breezed past Iowa's banged-up secondary.\n\nIowa's defense stiffened, and Stanley's 1-yard touchdown plunge gave the Hawkeyes a 15-14 lead with 12:10 left. Connor Assalley's 26-yard field goal gave Iowa State the lead back with 7:46 to go, but Duncan answered from 39 yards with 4:51 left with what proved to be the game-winning kick.\n\nPurdy finished with 276 yards passing and a touchdown for the Cyclones.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nIowa was on the road against its biggest rival and had to deal with two weather delays, turning an afternoon kickoff into a primetime affair. Yet the Hawkeyes still found a way to win, going 10 of 19 on third down and winning the turnover battle, 2-0.\n\nIowa State looked much better than it did in its opener two weeks ago, when it sleepwalked past Northern Iowa 29-26 in triple overtime. But this was yet another agonizing loss to the Hawkeyes for the Cyclones, who fell 44-41 in overtime two years ago in Ames.\n\nPOLL IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe Hawkeyes might not move up that much, but the win was nevertheless impressive.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIowa is off next week before hosting Middle Tennessee on Sept. 28.\n\nIowa State hosts Louisiana-Monroe next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: and", "description": "AMES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Nate Stanley threw for 201 yards and ran for a score, and No. 19 Iowa made a big fourth-down stop late in the game, allowing the Hawkeyes to beat Iowa State 18-17 on Saturday night for their fifth straight win over the Cyclones.", "authors": ["Luke Meredith", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://media.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
