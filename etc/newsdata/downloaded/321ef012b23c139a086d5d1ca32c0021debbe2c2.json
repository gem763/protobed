(AP) - DK Metcalf seemed to do everything right in his first Seattle Seahawks game.\n\nHe wore a vintage Steve Largent jersey to the stadium. He caught a pair of deep passes where his combination of size and speed were on display. He even added a little flash to the typical football attire with a mouthpiece designed like a baby pacifier.\n\nMetcalf may have been about the only one who wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\n\u201cI could have done a lot of stuff better but overall it was just fun and just a good experience to be out there for the first time,\u201d Metcalf said.\n\nDespite his modesty, the Seahawks\u2019 second-round pick certainly justified the hype that has surrounded him. He finished with four catches for 89 yards, setting a Seattle rookie record for yards receiving in his debut. He was also Seattle\u2019s most-targeted receiver, a sign of the confidence quarterback Russell Wilson has in him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working with him since the day he got drafted for the most part,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHis work ethic is unbelievable. He works extremely hard. We worked all offseason together. He\u2019s got knowledge of the game. I think the thing that jumps out about DK more than anything else is his mind. He understands the game really well. He sees things and reacts.\u201d\n\nOne play in particular during the Seahawks\u2019 win over Cincinnati on Sunday provided a perfect example of how quickly the connection between the quarterback and receiver has developed.\n\nWilson was pressured and scrambled free of the rush. He was about to cross the line of scrimmage when he saw Metcalf downfield and gave the big receiver a chance to make the play. Metcalf shielded a defender and used his height to pull in a 25-yard pass.\n\n\u201cMost rookies don\u2019t recognize things as fast, in their first couple of games at least, as fast as DK did in that first game. I think he saw things when I was scrambling and reacted quickly,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nMetcalf did have one negative play, getting called for offensive pass interference when he clearly pushed off the defensive back. Offensive pass interference is a point of emphasis for officials this year and Metcalf is learning he\u2019ll be watched.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to know that they are calling OPI a lot more so just got to change my game to the rules,\u201d Metcalf said. \u201cI know I\u2019ve got a lot of strength that most receivers don\u2019t have so just got to adapt and change with the game.\u201d\n\nNOTES: C Justin Britt (knee), G Mike Iupati (calf) and DEs Ziggy Ansah (shoulder) and L.J. Collier (ankle) were all full participants in practice Thursday. WR Tyler Lockett (back) was limited after sitting out Wednesday\u2019s practice. S Tedric Thompson (hamstring) and DT Poona Ford (calf) both missed their second straight practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "DK Metcalf seemed to do everything right in his first Seattle Seahawks game.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Booth"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/bengals_seahawks_football_42622_c0-152-3631-2269_s1770x1032.jpg?d9ca7b0959156a8f4b1eb4ce1d0a8932107afa3d", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
