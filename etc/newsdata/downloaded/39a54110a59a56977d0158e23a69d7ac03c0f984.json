It's an NHS pension.\n\nSCROLL DOWN TO FIND OUT HOW TO ASK YOUR PENSION QUESTION\n\nRetirement dilemma: Will my disability and sickness benefits stop if I start taking my pension? (Stock image)\n\nSteve Webb replies: Whether or not drawing an occupational pension affects your benefits depends on what sort of benefit you are getting.\n\nThere are three main categories of social security benefit.\n\nThe first type is a benefit like Personal Independence Payment (PIP) which helps you with the extra costs of being disabled.\n\nThis benefit is not means-tested (it doesn\u2019t depend on your income) and not contributory (it is not dependent on your record of National Insurance Contributions).\n\nGetting an occupational pension has no impact on your entitlement to this sort of benefit. This means that your PIP would continue, unaffected, if you started to draw your NHS pension.\n\nThe second type of benefit is a contributory benefit which you get based on your record of NI contributions.\n\nEmployment Support Allowance (ESA) can be paid on a contributory basis if you satisfy the contribution rules and are unable to work due to sickness.\n\nSteve Webb: Find out how to ask the former Pensions Minister a question about your retirement savings in the box below\n\nContributory ESA is affected by receipt of an occupational pension but only if your weekly occupational pension is above a minimum level, currently \u00a385 per week.\n\nFor every pound of occupational pension you have above \u00a385 per week, your Contributory ESA is reduced by fifty pence.\n\nThe third type of benefit is a means-tested benefit which you receive because you (and your household) are on a low income and you satisfy the rules around being unable to work.\n\nBecause you say \u2018we get ESA\u2019 in your question, I\u2019m assuming this is paid to your whole household and therefore this is likely to be means-tested ESA.\n\nIf the ESA you are receiving is indeed on a means-tested basis then your occupational pension is deducted on a pound-for-pound basis from your ESA from the very first pound of pension you receive.\n\nIf you are entitled to a large occupational pension this could completely wipe out your entitlement to ESA. (I am assuming from your question that you are due to get \u00a318,000 a year from your NHS pension, rather than that you have a pension pot of \u00a318,000 in total.)\n\nYou only mention ESA and PIP in your question but it is worth saying that receiving an occupational pension could also affect other means-tested benefits you may receive.\n\nIn particular, if you get help with your rent or council tax from the local authority then this could also be reduced if you start to draw an occupational pension.\n\nDetails of the DWP's benefit helplines are here.
