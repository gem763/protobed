The storm is expected to reach category four strength before making landfall. It\u2019s a major hurricane. It could cost lives and property damage. American families\u2019 homes could be devastated, but screw those people because Trump is president or something. Former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell made those hopes known concerning Dorian directly hitting Mar-a-Lago. Yet, she\u2019s not alone (via Newsmax):\n\nDavid Leavitt, an award-winning multimedia journalist also called for a direct hit on the exclusive club, and essentially blamed Dorian on Trump.\n\n\u201cTrump: Climate change is a hoax,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHere\u2019s a Category 4 hurricane with 130+ mph winds aimed right at Mar-a-Lago, with my compliments.\u201d\n\nAfter being hammered on Twitter for her classless tweet, Campbell also brought climate change into the equation.\n\n\u201cAs there are in Puerto Rico- sorry you don\u2019t get snark- but Trump\u2019s indifference to suffering is intolerable!\u201d she said. \u201cWd also help if he tackled climate change which is making hurricanes more destructive! Instead, he will remove limits on methane! Get a grip!\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s correct that the Trump administration announced plans Thursday to relax regulation on methane emissions, but that didn\u2019t contribute to Dorian\u2019s fury. Moreover, Florida hurricanes have become less frequent, according to a report by The Economist.\n\nIn addition, the World Health Organization proclaimed that the United States was one of the cleanest countries on the planet.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:15:20AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/41ebc7b1-2841-48fe-b9e1-ac928b3cf272.png"}
