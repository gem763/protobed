Bernie Sanders (I-VT) appears to be bouncing back both nationally and in key early primary states, retaking the lead in New Hampshire, a UNHSurveyCenter/CNN poll indicates\n\nSanders, who faced an end-of-summer slump that intensified following the news of his heart attack, is regaining the ground he lost in recent weeks. The news follows a flurry of high profile endorsements from key members of the \u201cSquad\u201d \u2013 Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) \u2013 and notable Hollywood figures, like notorious anti-Trump filmmaker Michael Moore.\n\nNew Hampshire, the first primary state to vote, is one of the most desirable states for the presidential hopefuls, and a survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire indicates that Sanders is back on top.\n\nThe University of New Hampshire Survey Center conducted the survey on October 21 \u2013 27, 2019 among 1,266 adults, including \u201c574 likely 2020 Democratic Primary voters and 461 likely 2020 Republican primary voters.\u201d\n\nAccording to the survey, Sanders leads the pack with 21 percent support, followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who falls three points behind with 18 percent support.\n\nJoe Biden (D) comes in third with 15 percent support, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) with ten percent support.\n\nAndrew Yang (D), Sen Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) followed with five percent support each. The remaining candidates garnered three percent support or less.

A YouGovUS/CBS News poll released prior to the fourth Democrat debate showed Sanders falling significantly behind in the Granite State, with 17 percent to Warren\u2019s 32 percent and Biden\u2019s 24 percent:\n\nNew Hampshire @YouGovUS/@CBSNews Poll (10/3-11):\n\nWarren 32%\n\nBiden 24%\n\nSanders 17%\n\nButtigieg 7%\n\nYang 5%\n\nHarris 4%\n\nSteyer 4%\n\nKlobuchar 2%\n\nGabbard 2%\n\nBooker 1%\n\nO'Rourke 1%\n\nRyan 1%\n\nSestak 0%\n\nWilliamson 0%\n\nMessam 0%\n\nBullock 0%\n\nCastro 0%\n\nBennet 0%\n\nDelaney 0%https://t.co/bfqNPawtRa \u2014 Political Polls (@Politics_Polls) October 13, 2019\n\nSanders has made a noticeable effort to combat concerns over his age and health in recent days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been criticized for being old. I plead guilty. I am old,\u201d Sanders said during a campaign stop in Iowa last week, adding, \u201cBut there are advantages to being old.\u201d\n\nSanders argued that his age proves that the \u201cideas that I am fighting for now didn\u2019t come to me yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on more picket lines, I expect, than all my opponents combined over the last 30 years,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cHaving a long record gives people the understanding that these ideas that I am talking about \u2014 they are in my guts. They are in my heart,\u201d he added. \u201cThis is who I am as a human being, and it ain\u2019t gonna change.\u201d\n\nMoore, who spoke at a Sanders rally in Queens this month, also defended Sanders\u2019 age and health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually a gift that we have a 78-year-old American running for president of the United States,\u201d Moore said, arguing that the Electoral College \u2013 not Sanders \u2013 is \u201ctoo old.\u201d\n\nThe Fahrenheit 11/9 director also dismissed concerns surrounding Sanders\u2019 health.\n\n\u201cHow about we talk about the health of this planet that\u2019s dying. That\u2019s the health I care about,\u201d Moore added.", "description": "Sen.
