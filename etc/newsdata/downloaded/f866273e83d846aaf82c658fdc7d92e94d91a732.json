The market has slumped somewhat and there are fewer big-name titles than usual this year (though Rick, Nigel and Jamie all have books out). Instead, there are more books with a tight focus (what might have been called \u201cniche\u201d in the past), about specific regions, ingredients or flavours. Bring it on: books such as those by Mark Diacono, on sourness in cooking, and Catherine Phipps, who focuses on leaves, are worth their weight in gold.\n\nIf you\u2019re longing for good food reads, rather than recipes, Jeff Gordinier\u2019s Hungry, an account of four years travelling with Danish superstar chef Ren\u00e9 Redzepi, is fascinating (all the more so because Gordinier\u2019s marriage was falling apart so he just let himself be sucked into a mad world between Mexico, Copenhagen, Australian and the Bronx). I also loved Charlotte Druckman\u2019s Women on Food, a volume by and about just that. Some of the best American writers are in there, but there\u2019s an interview with Nigella Lawson, an essay by Bee Wilson and commentary from Ruby Tandoh, should you care for a British fix.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that my two top cookbook titles of the autumn are from restaurants. But they offer much more than recipes; they have a philosophy and an outlook on life as well as cooking that inspires.", "description": "It\u2019s that time of year again:", "authors": ["Diana Henry", "The Telegraph'S Award-Winning Cookery Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/food-and-drink/2019/10/02/TELEMMGLPICT000211116261-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqQLrR4T1kiRjV7v0mvDEy6J8aCNctvEEBHJFkN_RNg0M.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
