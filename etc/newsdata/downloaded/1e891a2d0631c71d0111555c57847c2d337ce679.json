He claimed he saw Phosa and his associate, Nick Elliot, concocting an intelligence report which alleged that Mabuza was an apartheid spy.\n\n\n\nVenter, who worked as Phosa\u2019s butler in Hazyview, went to Mabuza about these allegations after he had a labour dispute with Phosa.\n\nHe then played the two politicians by switching his allegiance between them in a build up to a R10 million lawsuit Mabuza had instituted against Phosa for disseminating the so-called spy report.\n\nPhosa maintained that the report was anonymously dropped off at his White River house and he had sent it to the ANC officials \u2013 then president Jacob Zuma, his deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, chairperson Baleka Mbete, secretary Gwede Mantashe and treasurer Zweli Mkhize - via deputy secretary Jessie Duarte\u2019s email address.\n\nIn 2017 the Pretoria High Court dismissed the defamation claim and ordered Mabuza to pay Phosa\u2019s legal fees,\n\nVenter has been under the NPA\u2019s witness protection programme for 15 months since he approached the Hawks and claimed that Mabuza\u2019s associates had bribed him to testify against Phosa.\n\nLove this, love that people see I am not the liar. Jan Venter\n\nBut the NPA kicked Venter out of the programme last month following his outburst in an email sent to political parties, the media and whole lot of other people on August 16. In the email he revealed the address of the safe house where he lived, published cellphone numbers of senior NPA officials and accused them of being \u201cprobably in cahoots with Mabuza to have me killed\u201d.\n\nVenter however said that he was kicked out because he put pressure on the Hawks and the NPA to conclude the investigation and charge Mabuza. He felt that he was being kept in the programme to silence him. In the WhatsApp messages seen by City Press, Heap assures Venter that the investigation is at an advanced stage.\n\nIn one, Heap writes: \u201c \u2026 The investigation is at an advanced stage and should be handed over to the NPA for perusal and decision in the near future.\n\n\u201cWhat takes time is when subpoenas are issued for bank records, we must give the financial institutions at least 14 days to respond \u2026 Our aim is to trace back where the money originated from that paid you.\u201d\n\nHeap further writes: \u201cWe must identify those persons and or companies. This is what is taking time. Remember we must try and corroborate your evidence independently from what you tell us.\u201d\n\nThen Heap indicates that Venter was bought a car and a firearm. \u201cGot it all, thanks Jan. Besides the slips, we need the accounts as well but we have those. We have also identified the people who bought you your car and firearm,\u201d Heap says.\n\nVenter responds: \u201cLove this, love that people see I am not the liar.\u201d\n\nWhen Venter demands more answers, Heap reminds him that he can not be trusted with keeping information to himself. \u201cJan, I have to be very cautious when WhatsApping you on progress in the matter because 12 hours later you email all and sundry with my WhatsApps as attachments. We don\u2019t investigate in this manner.\u201d\n\nCity Press has also seen an email dated July 30 in which Heap asks Venter to provide cellphone numbers that he used to contact Mabuza, Jasmine Ally (former chief of staff in the Mpumalanga premier\u2019s office), the person who bought Venter a firearm in White River and the person who bought him a vehicle in Nelspruit.\n\nDespite promising to respond after getting the information, Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi did not come back to City Press.\n\nIn August, Mulaudzi said: \u201cWe have indeed received various allegations or complaints from Venter which we continue to investigate, firstly, in order to establish their veracity and, secondly, to establish possible culpability where necessary.\n\n\u201cWhen the process concludes, the resultant decision will be communicated,\u201d he said.\n\nMabuza\u2019s spokesperson, Thami Ngwenya, said: \u201cWe are not aware of any legitimate reason why there is this rumour of an investigation. The Minister of Police [Bheki Cele] may be better placed to clarify this matter.\u201d\n\nTALK TO US\n\nAfter the lies Jan Venter has told about David Mabuza in the past, do you think he is now telling the truth?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword TRUTH and tell us what you think.
