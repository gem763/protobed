EST, but it\u2019s leaked. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi is formally signing off on an impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump after he spoke to the Ukrainians, reportedly trying to coerce the political leadership there to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden on corruption charges. This was dredged up after a whistleblower came forward to the intelligence community inspector general, though it\u2019s based on anonymous second-hand sources. The whistleblower didn\u2019t even listen in on the calls, and it\u2019s not the intelligence community\u2019s job to snitch on the president. The president can say whatever he wants to another foreign leader. Period. And now, before anyone has read the transcript of the call, the House Democrats are launching a full-blown impeachment push. It\u2019s not shocking. This was going to happen eventually. They had to do this; this is why the Democrats retook the House in 2018. So, fix bayonets, everyone. This is going to get bloody (via NYT):\n\nPELOSI in the closed dem caucus meeting: this is a \u201cmoment of truth\u201d \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s a great idea to plunge the country into the impeachment abyss without even first having seen the transcript of the alleged impeachable conduct.

He says his committee will he making decisions. He says they DONT want to go into 2020. \u2014 Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) September 24, 2019\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce on Tuesday that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, Democrats close to her said, taking decisive action in response to startling allegations that the president sought to enlist a foreign power for his own political gain. After months of caution, Ms. Pelosi has become convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s reported actions, and his administration\u2019s refusal to share details about the matter with Congress, left the House no alternative but to move forward with an inquiry that has the potential to reshape his presidency and cleave an already divided nation just a year before he plans to stand for re-election. The people close to her confirmed her plans on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose a decision that could still change. The announcement was expected at 5 p.m. in her Capitol office, after Ms. Pelosi was to hold a private meeting with House Democrats. At issue are allegations that Mr. Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son. The conversation is said to be part of a whistle-blower complaint that the Trump administration has withheld from Congress.\n\nFolks, we all knew this was going to happen. As for Pelosi, well, she has to know this isn\u2019t going anywhere in the Republican Senate. Also, what if the more moderate Democrats, the ones who won in more conservative-leaning districts decide to defect and vote against an impeachment measure? This whole circus is now officially coming to town. It\u2019s going to get nasty.\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\nPelosi said the actions of the Trump White House were a violation of law concerning the administration blocking the intelligence community IG from turning over this complaint. She invoked some history lecture about the 1787 Constitutional Convention to frame this as a move that seeks to protect our republic from Trump. On Thursday, that complaint from the whistleblower will come due for being turned over to Congress. She finally announced her support for an impeachment inquiry. She did not take any questions from the press.\n\nOf course, President Trump took to Twitter, aptly calling this effort \"witch hunt garbage.\"\n\nPelosi, Nadler, Schiff and, of course, Maxine Waters! Can you believe this? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nThey never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2019\n\nSuch an important day at the United Nations, so much work and so much success, and the Democrats purposely had to ruin and demean it with more breaking news Witch Hunt garbage.
