In fact, you don\u2019t have to do much at all. Begin your shift into alignment with a method I call \u201cChoose Again.\u201d\n\nTHE 3-STEP CHOOSE AGAIN METHOD\n\nWhen you begin this practice, I recommend you document each step in your Super Attractor journal. The more you practice this method, the more it will become second nature. In time you\u2019ll be able to quickly follow the method in your mind whenever you need it. For now, however, let your journal support your path.\n\nStep 1: Notice the thought.\n\nWhen you find yourself stuck in negativity or fear, consciously step back. You can do this by noticing that your thoughts and energy are out of alignment with joy. Ask yourself, \u201cHow do I feel right now?\u201d Write down your answer in your journal.\n\nStep 2: Forgive the thought.\n\nForgive yourself for being misaligned and celebrate your desire to shift. Thank your negative feelings and thoughts for showing you what you don\u2019t want and revealing what you do. Next to each negative thought that you document, write the words Thank you for revealing to me what I don\u2019t want so that I can clarify what I do want.\n\nStep 3: Choose again.\n\nAnswer this question in your journal: \u201cWhat is the best-feeling thought I can find right now?\u201d Then ask then Universe to guide you toward that thought. In your journal, write down this prayer or say it to yourself: Thank you, Universe, for guiding my thoughts toward good-feeling emotions.\n\nAs you practice this step, remember that you are reaching for the next best feeling. You are not required to land on the ultimate solution. So, for instance, if you are struggling with finances, the thought \u201cI\u2019m going to be out of debt in one week!\u201d is likely to create more misalignment because you probably wouldn\u2019t believe it. Instead, choose a thought that feels realistic and possible. For this step to work, you must believe in your next best thought. If there\u2019s any doubt, then your energy won\u2019t back up your prayer. (Keep in mind that the Universe always hears your prayers. But your energy must support those prayers in order for you to hear the guidance that the Universe then provides).\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s look together at how we might apply the three steps of the Choose Again Method: As before, imagine someone who is suffering from financial lack and uncertainty. Understandably, this person\u2019s dominant thoughts center around debt and the crippling fear of not being able to pay their bills. They\u2019ve become obsessed with these fearful thoughts because the inner voice of fear (otherwise known as the ego) has convinced them that the more they think about it, the more they can control their circumstances. It is at this stage that we can start to apply the initial step of recognizing the negative thoughts. It\u2019s normal, of course, to think that obsessing over an issue is how we find solutions. But it actually has the opposite effect. The more your mentality tends toward fear and lack, the further away you are from allowing solutions to come into your consciousness. We bring energy to the object of our focus. That energy influences our emotional state, and it\u2019s our emotional state that is our point of attraction. Fear-minded thinking puts us out of alignment with positive energy. When we\u2019re out of alignment with positive energy, we\u2019re disconnected from the support of the Universe. The Universe has the capacity to bring forth creative solutions for earning, new ways of managing money, and other ideas that the fear-based logical mind cannot come up with. But we have to be in a receptive place to hear the answers.\n\n\n\nThe way out of that negative loop is through Step 2, forgiving the misaligned thoughts. Through forgiveness, we can release the past and accept that the present moment offers an opportunity for grace. Even a slight moment of presence is enough to redirect our energy and get positive momentum to help choose a better thought. Moving to Step 3, we think, \u201cWhat is the best-feeling thought I can find right now?\u201d A nice way to get there in this instance could be with a statement like \u201cI\u2019m open to creative possibilities for abundance.\u201d This statement becomes a prayer. By saying this kind of affirmation silently or out loud, we make a massive announcement to the Universe that we are ready to choose again. The very second we choose a loving thought, our emotions shift and our energy changes. This is realignment with the Universe.\n\n\n\nThe Choose Again Method may seem too simple at first. You may be wondering how you can just shift out of negative thoughts that may have plagued you for years. I assure you that choosing to shift your thoughts doesn\u2019t have to be difficult. It does not matter whether these negative thoughts have been with you for 2 weeks or 20 years. The simple choice to feel better is enough to put you on a path to what you desire. So use these three steps to help you redirect your energy and slow down the flow of negativity.\n\n\n\nThe simplicity of this method might tempt you to dismiss its value. Let me be very clear: we don\u2019t have time to dwell in our drama. Being committed to a spiritual path means that we\u2019re ready to wake up fast. We need to make feeling good our highest priority and do whatever it takes to be Super Attractors. Our commitment to living in alignment will help us stay sane in these times. No matter where you are in the world, you cannot hide from the negative energy of the daily news, political climate, and feelings of divisiveness. Even if you were able to ignore the world around you, perhaps by avoidance or escapism, you would do so at the expense of the greater good. You would deprive the world of your positive energy, which affects not just you but everyone you come into contact with.\n\nExcerpt from SUPER ATTRACTOR: Methods for Manifesting a Life beyond Your Wildest Dreams is reprinted with permission from Hay House.", "description": "Book excerpt: Gabby Bernstein's 'Super Attractor: Methods for manifesting a life beyond your wildest dreams'", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/gabrielle-bernstein-gty-jc-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
