When we go to the schools, the kids get very excited when they see the rangers coming. We are very much role models to them.\u201d\n\nCox says: \u201cIn our communities there is the clinic, the school, the shop or there\u2019s CDP [work for the dole]. There are no other jobs. Being a ranger means an income, as well as training.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The female rangers at Windjana Gorge in the Kimberley.

The policy was axed in 2015 but the rangers say it was a briefly successful way to get more women trained and employed.\n\nBattle of One Tree Hill: remembering an Indigenous victory and a warrior who routed the whites | David Marr Read more\n\nAcross Australia, there are about 120 Indigenous ranger groups. The federal government\u2019s Working on Country program allocated $800m over 10 years to 2023 \u2013 $660,000 a program each year \u2013 but there are no funds targeted specifically at Aboriginal women.\n\nThe national auditor is preparing to assess the economic and social benefits of ranger programs. Anecdotally they are viewed as a success story for employment and the environment.\n\nIn Arnhem Land the Warddeken rangers use traditional and modern fire management skills to help control the timing, intensity and scale of bushfires.\n\nFrom that practice has come the West Arnhem Land fire abatement project under which industry, government and community work together to offset greenhouse gas emissions. Since it began in 2006, rangers have abated more than 1.7m tonnes of greenhouse gases.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lillian Bin Kali, Helena Williams and Devena Cox at Windjana Gorge.

Out there, you\u2019re at peace.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re busy when you\u2019re out there working but when you sit back, you see that everything connects and there\u2019s a purpose to it all.\u201d\n\nThe women control invasive weeds, do burnoffs according to traditional seasonal knowledge and track endangered species.\n\n\u201cWe say we work with plants, but we are not just looking at plants,\u201d Cox says. \u201cThose plants tell us about the seasons. Which fruits are growing or what\u2019s flowering tell you what fish are running, what animals are ready to hunt. It\u2019s all connected.\n\n\u201cSometimes we don\u2019t realise the value of what we have in this country.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Samantha Hiranni Simler Nugget, a member of the all-female Ngurrara rangers helicopter crew.

We monitor marine debris \u2013 it\u2019s a major problem.\u201d\n\nClearing plastic off remote beaches is a big job for rangers all across the northern coastline of Australia. Last year the Dhimurru rangers in eastern Arnhem Land collected two and a half tonnes of rubbish, including 20kg of cigarette lighters and 32kg of plastic bags: roughly five times the amount they collected in 2016.\n\n\u201cMen rangers do the marine work on the water, women are land-based,\u201d Cox says. \u201cBut we are getting more and more involved in what they do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been so good at our work that the men have had to step up,\u201d Sibosado adds, laughing. \u201cThey can see our potential. They see they\u2019d better watch out because we could be taking over!\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ngurrara rangers log a sighting of wild camels.

They have to talk to tourists, talk to schools. Over the past five years I\u2019ve rally seen those young girls grow.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of work and no shortage of women who\u2019d like to do it, but the barriers are funding security and access to formal training.\n\n\u201cCertainty is needed,\u201d Cox says. \u201cYou can\u2019t look after country if you\u2019re only funded on a six-monthly basis.\u201d\n\nSibosado says: \u201cAs a coordinator, I\u2019d say we are vastly under-represented. Less than 30% of rangers are women. The employment situation is getting better but funding is a big issue.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Ngurrara rangers\u2019 chopper takes off. Photograph: Kimberley Land Council\n\nBoth say the job is a privilege and an honour.\n\n\u201cWe are going to keep fighting for ranger programs,\u201d Sibosado says. \u201cBecause we know how good it is for our country and for the younger generation. We are working to break the stereotypes of Aboriginal women and we will achieve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe walk with our heads high,\u201d Devena Cox says. \u201cWe will break that barrier for Aboriginal women in Australia.
