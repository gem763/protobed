In fact, for a short window of time in the 1960s, America's supersonic, high-flying drones were already attempting reconnaissance flights over China.\n\nIn May of 1960, the United States was at a crossroads. A CIA pilot named Francis Gary Powers flying America's classified U-2 Spy Plane had been shot down over the Soviet Union at the start of the month.\n\nThe ensuing international incident edged the world one step closer toward nuclear Armageddon, and President Dwight Eisenhower made the decision to cease all manned flights into Soviet airspace as a result. With reconnaissance satellite technology under development but still years away from providing actionable intelligence, Lockheed's famed Skunkworks set to work on another possibility: unmanned flights over the Soviet Union.\n\nA modified A-12 (codename M-21) carrying a D-21 drone sometime around 1966. CIA/Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn October of 1962, legendary engineer Kelly Johnson, whose career included designing both the U-2 spy plane and the SR-71 Blackbird, set to work designing what would come to be called the D-21: A long-range, high altitude drone that leaned heavily on technology developed for the SR-71's predecessor, the A-12.\n\nThe requirements Johnson was given by the CIA and US Air Force were nothing short of extreme: The drone had to reach speeds of Mach 3.3\u20133.5, an operational altitude of 87,000\u201395,000 feet, and needed a fuel range of 3,000 nautical miles.\n\nAny modern-day engineer would tell you that such a project would still be daunting today, but Johnson had made a career out of accomplishing the seemingly impossible \u2014 often with little more than a hand ruler and scratch paper for calculations.\n\nHis D-21 design could meet all the requirements set out for him, but in order to achieve such high speeds at such high altitudes, he had to use a ramjet engine that couldn't function until it was already flying high in the sky. As a result, plans were drawn up to deploy the drone from a variant of the A-12, dubbed the M-21 Blackbird.\n\nWith a wingspan of just over 19 feet and a length of nearly 43 feet, the D-21 looked a lot like someone had just hacked the end off of one of the A-12's wings, making the M-21 a matching aesthetic choice, if nothing else.\n\nThe D-21 carried a single high-resolution camera that would snap photos over a pre-programmed flight path. It would then eject the film canisters, which would drift down via parachute and float in water. The plan was to capture these canisters in the air, with Navy ships positioned to retrieve them from the water as a backup. The drone itself would then self-destruct to avoid being captured and reverse-engineered.\n\nThe first three test flights of the D-21 from the M-21 Blackbird went smoothly, but on the fourth attempt, the drone experienced an \" asymmetric unstart \" passing through the bow wake of its M-21 mothership. The two aircraft collided in mid-air at the blistering speed of Mach 3.25.\n\nBoth pilots managed to eject, but one ultimately drowned before he could be rescued. The decision was made to scrap the M-21 mothership strategy and instead deploy the D-21 from beneath the wings of the B-52H bomber.\n\nA D-21 launches from its B-52 carrier aircraft, using a massive rocket booster to accelerate to a high enough speed for its ramjet engine to operate.

Two of the drones completed their flights, but either failed to eject their film, or the film was deemed irretrievable. The other two flights were either shot down or simply disappeared shortly after launch.\n\nDespite their failures over China, the D-21 program was significantly ahead of its time. A Mach 3 capable drone with an operational ceiling of 90,000 feet was an unheard of proposition in its day and remains impressive even in this new era of unmanned aerial vehicles.\n\nThe program was ultimately canceled on July 15, 1971, with the B-52s converted for use in the program returned to operational service.", "description": "After a CIA pilot named Francis Gary Powers was shot down in a U-2 Spy Plane over the Soviet Union, the US tried something different.", "authors": ["Alex Hollings", "We Are The Mighty"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d8b74152e22af2de556e365?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
