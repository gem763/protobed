Reinhardt\u2019s oft-used crack was no mere jest. It reflected his belief in the judicial duty to unleash the full potential of the Constitution as a means for justice and social progress. His was an activism of Warren-court vintage that for decades made a home on the 9th Circuit.\n\nReinhardt was still in active judicial service when he died in March 2018, meaning it was for President Donald Trump to replace him. The death of an iconic progressive cause lawyer turned federal judge, and his succession by a young movement conservative, placed in sharp relief the Trump administration\u2019s determined campaign to slowly transform the nation\u2019s largest appeals court.\n\nThat story is not yet a triumphalist one. Though Trump has made more appointments to the 9th Circuit than any other federal appeals court, Democrat appointees still maintain a majority. What\u2019s more, the judges he has appointed have only served for a brief time, making assessments premature. Still, the president has stacked his chief judicial adversary with a roster of increasingly conservative personnel, with additional confirmations expected before the end of 2019.\n\nMeasuring Trump\u2019s success\n\nThe president has made seven appointments to the 9th Circuit. When Trump took office there were 18 Democrat appointees, seven Republican appointees, and four vacancies on that court, according to a Brookings Institution tabulation. As of this writing, there are 16 Democrat appointees and 12 GOP appointees with one vacancy remaining.\n\nWhether Trump\u2019s appointments have prompted a reorientation of the court is a debatable proposition. Three of Trump\u2019s nominees succeeded Republican-appointed judges. Though one of those retired judges, Alex Kozinski, was an unconventional jurist, on balance those three appointments did not change the 9th Circuit\u2019s ideological balance.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, one of the four Democrat appointees Trump has replaced, Judge Richard Tallman, was a Republican former President Bill Clinton appointed as part of a deal with GOP lawmakers from Washington state. A second Clinton appointee Trump replaced, Judge Barry Silverman, was a bipartisan pick who was confirmed with the support of Arizona GOP Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl.\n\nAs such, Trump has not moved the jurisprudential needle much in many cases, University of Richmond School of Law Professor Carl Tobias told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a much younger person of course, but with not terribly different views,\u201d Tobias said of Trump appointments.\n\nTobias noted that Trump has replaced two genuine liberals \u2014 Reinhardt and fellow Carter appointee Judge Harry Pregerson. That\u2019s made a difference, albeit a modest one.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re closing the gap in terms of Republican appointees vis-a-vis Democratic appointees, but not dramatically,\u201d Tobias said. (RELATED: Trump Judicial Pick, A Child Of Jewish Refugees, Calls Racism Allegations \u2018Hurtful\u2019)\n\nEven while Republican-appointed judges remain a minority on the 9th Circuit, their increased numbers are meaningful. The circuit courts process appeals through randomly assigned three-judge panels. As a general matter, all judges on a given circuit court are bound to follow panel decisions. The uptick in Republican-appointed judges means the 9th Circuit is more likely to produce right-leaning panels.\n\nThe administration reaped the benefits of those improved odds in a lawsuit over the president\u2019s asylum restrictions. The new rule, subject to certain exceptions, would deny asylum to migrants who passed through another country on their way to the U.S. without first seeking protection there. U.S. District Judge Jon Tigar in San Francisco entered a nationwide injunction barring enforcement of those restrictions in July.\n\nOn appeal, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel that included a Trump appointee trimmed Tigar\u2019s order, ruling that the injunction would apply only within the 9th Circuit, and not on a nationwide basis. In effect, that meant the asylum restrictions would be in force at the border in Texas and New Mexico, but not Arizona and California.\n\nThough the move sounds modest, it had substantial policy implications, as most asylum-seekers arrive at the border in Texas. As such, Tigar\u2019s injunction applied only to a small minority of asylum-seekers. The Supreme Court lifted Tigar\u2019s injunction Sept. 11.\n\nThe decision a three-judge panel renders is itself appealable to either the Supreme Court or the full circuit court. On rare occasions, a full circuit court decides to review a panel decision. Those cases are called en banc appeals. On the mammoth 9th Circuit, an 11-judge panel will hear an en banc appeal. With more Republican-appointed personnel on the bench, there is a higher chance of producing a conservative en banc panel.\n\nIn recent decades conservative judges have served another important function on the 9th Circuit \u2014 flagging cases for Supreme Court review. Judges periodically write dissents when an en banc court declines to review a panel decision. Those dissents often read like unsubtle invitations for Supreme Court intervention.\n\nOne Trump-appointee on the 9th Circuit, Judge Ryan Nelson, recently wrote such an opinion. In June, the full 9th Circuit declined to rehear a panel decision that revived a teacher\u2019s lawsuit against her former employer, a Catholic elementary school. The legal question in that case involves the scope of the ministerial exception, a rule that exempts religious institutions from certain federal employment laws. Nelson dissented after the full 9th Circuit declined to review the panel decision. Eight other judges joined Nelson\u2019s dissent, Republican appointees all.\n\n\u201cNot once, not twice, but three times now in the last two years, we have departed from the plain direction of the Supreme Court and reversed our district courts\u2019 faithful application of Supreme Court precedent,\u201d Nelson\u2019s dissent reads.\n\nThe school\u2019s petition is pending before the high court.\n\nA priority for conservatives\n\nThe 9th Circuit\u2019s jurisdiction sprawls over much of the globe, encompassing remote Pacific atolls, the arid deserts in the American southwest, and those remote reaches of Alaska that touch the Arctic Circle. With a population of approximately 60 million, one in five Americans are subject to the 9th Circuit\u2019s dictates.\n\nTrump has clashed frequently with the 9th Circuit, which upheld injunctions against top administration policy priorities like the travel ban.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace when every case gets filed in the 9th Circuit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s not law, that\u2019s not what this country stands for. Every case that gets filed in the 9th Circuit, we get beaten and then we end up having to go to the Supreme Court, like the travel ban, and we won.\u201d\n\nHis criticisms drew a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts, who rejected Trump\u2019s charge that judges are sometimes motivated by politics.\n\nThat critique is common, but somewhat amiss. It is true that some 9th Circuit judges clashed openly and brazenly with the Supreme Court\u2019s increasingly conservative personnel. Indeed, the high court has reversed about 80% of the 9th Circuit cases it\u2019s reviewed in recent years. Yet the reasons for that high reversal rate aren\u2019t exclusively attributable to judicial politics.\n\nIn a given year, the 9th Circuit processes about one-fifth of cases that enter the federal courts. As such, it is more likely to generate the kind of disagreements among federal courts that provoke Supreme Court review. What\u2019s more, the 9th Circuit covers a political-social system that is uniquely complex and heterogenous, giving rise to especially difficult legal questions.\n\nStill, conservatives were so frustrated with the 9th Circuit\u2019s liberal valence that congressional Republicans explored splitting the court. Three 9th Circuit judges \u2014 Kozinski, Judge Carlos Bea, and Chief Judge Sidney Thomas \u2014 testified before a House committee on the subject in 2017. The trio opposed the idea.\n\nThe GOP cited administrative concerns, not ideological disagreement, when pressing the idea. With an enormous number of filings to manage, Republicans argued that the 9th Circuit cannot guarantee speedy disposition of cases, leaving unhappy litigants with lengthy turn-around times.\n\nOther advocates of splitting the 9th Circuit say establishing a new court would protect the high quality of judicial work product. One academic proponent of breaking the 9th Circuit, Vanderbilt University Law School professor Brian Fitzpatrick, told a congressional panel in 2017 that an increase in the number of seats on a given court raises the odds that an activist or an under-qualified judge would fill the post.\n\n\u201cThe quality of judicial output decreases as the number of judges on an appellate court expands,\u201d Fitzpatrick said.\n\nDetermined efforts in the Senate\n\nTrump\u2019s 9th Circuit nominees have benefited from an expedited confirmation process, despite vigorous objections from Democrats.\n\nFor example, Republicans have also curtailed lawmaker influence over judicial selection. Under the so-called blue slip system, lawmakers return either a positive or negative assessment of a judicial nominee selected for a judgeship in their state to the Judiciary Committee\u2019s chairman. In the past, the committee chairman would not schedule a confirmation hearing for a nominee until the relevant senators returned their blue slips, effectively giving lawmakers a veto over judges for their states.\n\nThough Democrats have withheld blue slips for many Trump circuit court nominees, Judiciary Committee Republicans have proceeded with hearings anyway. In breaking with that practice, the GOP argues the lawmakers cannot reasonably claim veto power over nominees for courts that cover multiple states. Though the jurisdiction of federal trial judges is confined to a particular state, circuit courts encompass several states.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has also invited certain circuit court nominees to appear for confirmation hearings in pairs, instead of one at a time. Nominees Eric Miller and Bridget Bade appeared together for a confirmation hearing in October 2018. Daniel Collins and Kenneth Lee followed suit and sat for a joint hearing March 13. All four have since been confirmed to the 9th Circuit.

Bress is a native Californian who practiced law in San Francisco before joining the Washington offices of Kirkland & Ellis LLP in 2008. Given his decade-long professional absence from the west coast, Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris of California opposed his nomination.\n\n\u201cOver the last two years, the longstanding Senate tradition of the blue slip has been gutted at the circuit court level by Chairman Grassley and Chairman Graham,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cAnd now, Republicans are creating a terrible new precedent of allowing out-of-state nominees that will only further undermine the role of the Senate.\u201d\n\nA fair share of challenges\n\nThe process has not been an unmitigated success for conservatives. On occasion the White House has settled for consensus nominees viewed warily by judicial conservatives. Such was the case of Judge Mark Bennett, a former Hawaii attorney general tapped for the 9th Circuit in February 2018 with the backing of Democratic Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz.\n\nThough Bennett is a Republican, GOP lawmakers were ambivalent about his nomination, citing legal briefs he signed during his tenure in state government that break with conservative constitutional orthodoxy. For example, Bennett joined a coalition of state attorneys general who urged the Supreme Court not to apply the Second Amendment against state-level gun control laws. He similarly argued that Supreme Court campaign finance precedents like Citizens United should not disturb state restrictions on political expenditures.\n\nTo GOP lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz, those positions betrayed a dim view of First and Second Amendment protections. The Senate confirmed Bennett on a 72-27 vote, with the majority of yes votes coming from Democrats.\n\nOne 9th Circuit nominee faltered in dramatic form. Federal prosecutor Ryan Bounds was on track for confirmation in July 2018 until GOP Sens. Tim Scott of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida decided to oppose him just as his nomination was pending on the Senate floor. Realizing that Bounds lacked the votes for confirmation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pulled the nomination.\n\nScott and Rubio took exception to opinion columns Bounds wrote as a Stanford undergraduate that harshly criticized campus multiculturalism policies and identity-specific student groups. They were further troubled that Bounds did not submit those writings to a judicial selection panel.\n\nThe president named two more nominees, Patrick Bumatay and Lawrence VanDyke, for the 9th Circuit on Friday.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
