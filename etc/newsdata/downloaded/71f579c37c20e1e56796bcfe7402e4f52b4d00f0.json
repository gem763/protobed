How do we ensure that we're plugging into this conversation and the kinds of areas that are shaping technology, not only the technology development itself, but the kinds of legislation that shape the absorption of that technology into the global environment,\" he said.\n\nSee: Government interference in Australia's premier cybersecurity conference is a worry\n\n\"It's an enormous challenge.\"\n\nThe \"canary in the coal mine\" in these matters has been what Feakin coyly referred to as \"the 5G issue\".\n\nAlthough Feakin didn't name China, it's clear that he was alluding to Australia's ban on the use of 5G technology from Chinese companies such as Huawei. Australia's foreign minister said in March that the ban was a \"resolved\" question.\n\n\"From where I sit, that is the first of many different technology issues that are going to come online where we need to be on the front foot and ensuring that we have national security interests, economic interests, and indeed societal interests at heart,\" Feakin said.\n\n\"I think many states are struggling with that ... Are countries going to learn when 6G comes online, for example, or are the same mistakes going to be made around the world? We're not sure.\"\n\nAustralia has also started to engage with the tech sector directly, which Feakin described as being the \"enormous companies that have [been] built up, making huge profits out of the data economy and the online space\".\n\n\"Those companies now often have the same kind of sway as states themselves in terms of the way that they shape ideas and thinking and indeed global trends,\" he said.\n\n\"They are some of the most fundamental shapers of our time.\"\n\nThis engagement with non-government entities represents a significant shift in diplomatic strategy.\n\nUntil recently, Australia's diplomatic efforts in the cyber realm had been focused primarily on national security matters, and working in the United Nations and elsewhere to establish international norms of behaviour in cyberspace.\n\nRead: Huawei believes banning it from 5G will make countries insecure\n\nAustralia has been part of multinational diplomatic efforts to call out bad behaviour by officially attributing cyber attacks to specific nations. Overall, the aim of Australia's cyber diplomacy strategy has been to promote an \"open, free, and secure cyberspace\".\n\nBut those core principles are now being challenged, Feakin said.\n\n\"There are certain states that look to target us actively, and they've seen basically the freedoms that we enjoy in the online space as a fundamental weakness which they're looking to take advantage of and ensure that they can position themselves for the coming 21st century,\" he said.\n\n\"We're on the cusp of change, and if we're not engaging and if we are not promoting our interests right now, then we will be shaped by everything that's to come.\"\n\nAustralia must work in the \"broad technology space\" to \"promote Australian interests\" rather than \"values and principles that don't really resonate with ourselves living in a liberal democracy\".\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nSchneier slams Australia's encryption laws and CyberCon speaker bans\n\nGovernments breaking encryption is bad, and 'will get worse once breaking encryption means people can die', says one of the world's leading security experts.\n\nACSC dumps annual conference, partners with AISA for cyber events\n\nAustralia's cybersecurity agency joins the nation's peak body for cyber professionals to deliver development programs through the government's Joint Cyber Security Centres.\n\nEurope warns 5G will increase attack paths for state actors\n\nIncreasing reliance on software will increase exposure, and countries will have increased risk from trusting a single vendor.\n\nKaspersky says malicious cyber attacks affecting nearly four in ten smart buildings (TechRepublic)\n\n37.8% of computers used to control smart building automation systems were impacted by cyber attacks in the first half of 2019.", "description": "The focus of Australia's cyber diplomacy is expanding to include \"grand strategy in technology\", as well as engagement with technology firms and governments.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/12/96f6fe25-435f-415a-8a53-1db66716c0c8/thumbnail/770x578/649636987ab53621a0060ebe5abd2ab2/istock-1146417905.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
