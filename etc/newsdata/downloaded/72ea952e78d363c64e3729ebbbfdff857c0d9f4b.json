An oasis of calm in the Birdcage madness", "language": "en", "text": "Dan F Stapleton Writer Oct 25, 2019 \u2014 12.00am Share\n\nThe unofficial theme of this year\u2019s Birdcage seems to be Bigger, Bolder and Brasher. Each of the 11 brands represented in the invitation-only enclosure \u2013 Seppelt Wines, Mumm and Schweppes among them \u2013 is attempting to up the ante in some way.\n\nHigh-end jeweller Kennedy is decking out its front-row marquee with millions of dollars worth of rare timepieces and casually installing a jazz band. Network 10, which has been gifted a significant slice of the front row as part of its new partnership deal, is building a fully functional broadcast studio with trackside views. And Tabcorp, which retains the expanded front-row footprint it acquired last year, is creating the ultimate gambling den, decking out its marquee with 19 jumbo screens and seven betting terminals.\n\nCrowds flock to the Birdcage for a previous Melbourne Cup. Jesse Marlow\n\nThe Japanese luxury car maker Lexus, principal partner of the Melbourne Cup, is presenting what is arguably its most ambitious marquee in 17 years of sponsorship (it has been a partner of the Victoria Racing Club since 2003). But instead of putting on a loud show like its peers, the brand has opted for a more contemplative experience in its three-storey \u2018pavilion\u2019 (as their Birdcage hosts like to call them).\n\nThe Melbourne Cup can be seen as the embodiment of shininess and luxury. We want to create something that is natural and simple. \u2014 Koichi Takada, architect\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really determined to create a completely different energy in the pavilion and make it feel and look very different to the surrounding racecourse landscape,\u201d says Joost Bakker, eco-warrior and polymath, who is responsible for the marquee\u2019s immersive floral arrangements this year.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Bakker and Lexus have collaborated in the Birdcage. Notably, in 2016, Bakker designed the Lexus marquee structure itself; the brand has repurposed it every year since. This year, Bakker has teamed up with Sydney-based architect Koichi Takada to reconfigure and dress the marquee \u2013 taking their cues from the car maker\u2019s newfound focus on sustainability.\n\nGate-like structures evoke the \"transition from the city to nature, the ordinary to the extraordinary\".\n\n\u201cThe environment is something I am very concerned with in my own work,\u201d says Takada. \u201cAnd, actually, it provides a connection between architecture and automobiles, because both industries are in a transition phase to become carbon neutral. As the whole nation stops and watches the Melbourne Cup, it\u2019s a great platform to promote such awareness.\u201d\n\nGuests moving through the Lexus pavilion\u2019s entrance courtyard will first lay eyes on the new RX Hybrid SUV, the company\u2019s most advanced sustainable vehicle, which Takada has cocooned in a curving gate-like structure made entirely from bamboo. \u201cThe gate represents the Japanese notion of torii,\u201d Takada says, \u201cwhich is the transition from the city to nature or the ordinary to the extraordinary. In Japan, you see this at the entrance to many temple shrines.\u201d", "description": "The VIP arena may be bigger and more glam than ever this year, but Lexus has bucked the trend with a more contemplative approach.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.144%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_109/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b21de223419704f851bbbef7e2fb717555392b1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
