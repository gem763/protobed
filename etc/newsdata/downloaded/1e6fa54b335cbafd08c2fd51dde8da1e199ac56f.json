REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh\n\nProtests broke out on Sept. 20 in Cairo and other cities following online calls for demonstrations against alleged graft by Sisi and the powerful military.\n\nSisi, who was in New York this week attending the U.N. General Assembly, returned to Cairo on Friday morning, where he was greeted off his plane by senior ministers and later stopped to speak to a crowd of supporters on the roadside.\n\nAsking them why they were up so early on a Friday, the first day of Egypt\u2019s weekend, he said: \u201cThe situation isn\u2019t worth it. You need to know that the Egyptian people are very aware ... Don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d\n\nSisi also appeared to repeat his earlier rejection of allegations of corruption posted online by Mohamed Ali, a former contractor and actor, in the run-up to the protests. Ali\u2019s videos have attracted a wide following.\n\n\u201cThis is an image being painted as was done before, comprised of lies and defamation and some media working to present an image that isn\u2019t true. We\u2019re really strong, the country is really strong with (because of) you,\u201d he said in a video posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nSince last weekend\u2019s protests, authorities have carried out a campaign of mass arrests which rights monitors say has seen around 2,000 people detained. Egypt\u2019s public prosecutor said on Thursday that \u201cnot more than 1,000\u201d had been questioned after participating in protests. [nL5N26H6DT]\n\nAli has called for new protests this Friday, though government supporters are also planning rallies to show their backing for Sisi and \u201cstablity\u201d. Buses ferrying Sisi supporters could be seen on the road leading to Cairo from the northern city of Alexandria, and crowds waving Egyptian flags and pictures of Sisi gathered in eastern Cairo after Friday prayers.\n\nHEAVY POLICE PRESENCE\n\nThe protests have unnerved investors and led to a pro-Sisi campaign in Egypt\u2019s strictly controlled media, which have tried to tarnish Ali\u2019s image and that of Egypt\u2019s enfeebled opposition. [nL5N26G2WW] [nL5N26H2YU]\n\nIn a Friday sermon broadcast on national TV, Egypt\u2019s minister of religious endowments accused \u201cpaid agents\u201d of undermining the nation.\n\nSecurity forces have stepped up their presence in main squares in major cities and plain clothes police have been checking motorists\u2019 and pedestrians\u2019 mobile phones for political content, checks that continued on Friday morning.\n\nRoads leading to Tahrir Square in central Cairo, the epicentre of protests that led to the overthrow of former President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, were shut to traffic. There was a heavy police presence around the square and at some junctions in central Cairo, including vehicles equipped with water cannon. Many shops and several central metro stations were closed.\n\nAt Cairo\u2019s Al-Fateh mosque, a starting point for protests in 2011, dozens of police, some in uniform and others in plain clothes with masks and large guns, stood near the exit as prayers finished.\n\nAt least 20 security vehicles were stationed around the mosque or patrolling nearby.\n\nSisi came to power after leading the overthrow of Islamist former President Mohamed Mursi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, in 2013 after mass protests against Mursi\u2019s rule. On Friday, he said that at some point he would request another show of mass support in which Egyptians would \u201cgo out in their millions\u201d.\n\nCRACKDOWN\n\nSisi has overseen a broad crackdown on dissent that has extended to liberal as well as Islamist groups, and which rights groups say is the most severe in recent memory. Muslim Brotherhood leaders have been imprisoned or fled abroad.\n\nHis backers say the crackdown was needed to stabilise Egypt after the turmoil that followed the country\u2019s 2011 uprising.\n\nSeveral hundred of those detained in the past week - who include prominent writers, activists and opposition figures - have been placed under investigation for charges including using social media to spread false news, joining a banned terrorist group, and protesting without a permit, defence lawyers say.\n\nThe International Commission of Jurists, a Geneva-based group that works to uphold the rule of law worldwide, called for the release of those \u201cdetained for exercising their fundamental freedoms\u201d.\n\nUnder Sisi, Egypt has undertaken a series of economic reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund which have won praise from economists but also increased pressure on many ordinary Egyptians, denting the president\u2019s popularity.\n\nAusterity and the crackdown have left some torn between unhappiness at the situation and wariness of renewed unrest.\n\n\u201cIf this country goes under it won\u2019t recover,\u201d said one 46-year-old taxi driver. \u201cIt\u2019s under now, but there are degrees of how bad it can get.\u201d", "description": "Egyptian police mounted a huge show of force in central Cairo and closed off entrances to Tahrir Square on Friday after calls for protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following opposition accusations of corruption, which he denies.", "authors": ["Aidan Lewis", "Omar Fahmy", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434527902&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0V9-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
