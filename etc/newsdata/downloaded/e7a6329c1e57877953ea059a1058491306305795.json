If you\u2019re not sure which version you\u2019re running, Apple has a support page about the issue, which also explains how to check which version you\u2019re using.\n\nYour phone needs the update because of the GPS time rollover issue. Basically, GPS devices measure date and time using a week counter, which is only able to count up to week 1,024, after which the counter resets back to zero. Since GPS requires accurate time data to function, the reset can disrupt location data, too. Date resets are a recurring issue for technology, probably most famously in the Millennium / Y2K bug.\n\nClocks have stopped Apple products before\n\nNewer devices have been designed to adapt to the rollover, according to Ars Technica, and it might only be your GPS accuracy that gets affected by the bug, if you\u2019re affected at all. Apple says the iPhone 4S, first-generation iPad mini, iPad 2, and fourth- and third-gen iPad will need an update to keep their GPS working accurately, although other functions should continue to work if you forget to update. Verizon said that the GPS accuracy on any device built between 2006 and 2016 could be impacted, and published a list of affected devices here.\n\nFortunately, for most devices there\u2019s an easy fix: just update.\n\nYou can update your phone wirelessly or through your computer before November 3rd. Here are Apple\u2019s instructions on how to do that. If you don\u2019t have the update installed by November 3rd, though, Apple says over-the-air updates and iCloud backup will also no longer work, since the GPS issue affects iCloud. If that happens, you would need to back up and restore your phone using a computer. Here\u2019s another guide on how to do that.\n\nClocks have stopped Apple products before. A bug caused iPhones to crash multiple times once the clock struck 12:15AM on December 2nd, 2017. Last year, daylight saving time confused Apple Watches, trapping them in a crash and reboot loop.\n\nApple says the GPS rollover won\u2019t impact their devices until just before 12:00AM UTC on November 3rd, which is 8:00PM ET on November 2nd. But don\u2019t wait until then \u2014 go update your phone now!", "description": "How to update your iPhone 5 to iOS 10.3.4 in order to keep important functions including the App Store, iCloud, email, and web browsing working after a time and date bug kicks in on November 3rd.", "authors": ["Aliya Chaudhry", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wXm0DlxLN6Ymg7mW-MXknMJknVE=/0x72:1020x606/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/1410801/iPhone5_main1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
