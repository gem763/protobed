Your mother and I never would have moved into this neighborhood if we had known you\u2019d need a gun to walk down the damn street,\u201d Willie says. He holds up his fists. \u201cWhen I was growing up this was all the protection we needed,\u201d he tells Craig. \u201cYou win some, you lose some, but you live to fight another day.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe crude bathroom line may be synonymous with Witherspoon, who died Tuesday at 77. But so, too, is the nurturing father figure behind the toilet humor. After Witherspoon\u2019s family announced his death Wednesday in a tweet from the actor\u2019s social media account, tributes came pouring in from co-stars and fans who remembered his signature roles, which often defied nefarious stereotypes about black fatherhood.\n\nHe was Robert Freeman, the gruff but loving Granddad on the animated series, \u201cThe Boondocks.\u201d And he was \u201cPops\u201d to many, following his beloved run as John \u201cPops\u201d Williams on the 1990s sitcom \u201cThe Wayans Bros.\u201d While many actors go to great lengths to shed previously defining roles, Witherspoon embraced each one, often resurfacing fan-favorite jokes from his past projects in his newer ventures.\n\nA Detroit native, Witherspoon got his start in stand-up comedy, after a stint as a department store model. The comedy circuit introduced him to legendary entertainers including Robin Williams and David Letterman, who regularly hosted Witherspoon on his CBS late-night show. Witherspoon went on to star alongside other comedy legends on TV shows and films such as \u201cThe Richard Pryor Show,\u201d Robert Townsend\u2019s \u201cHollywood Shuffle,\u201d and the Eddie Murphy-led \u201cBoomerang.\u201d He and Murphy later co-starred in Wes Craven\u2019s \u201cVampire in Brooklyn,\u201d which Witherspoon often cited as one of his favorite projects.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWitherspoon, who grew up as one of 11 children, often recalled his family\u2019s financial struggles in interviews. Though he and many of his siblings went on to be successful (his brother William worked for Motown and co-wrote Jimmy Ruffin\u2019s \u201cWhat Becomes of the Brokenhearted\u201d), Witherspoon never forgot the sting of poverty. The experience became central to his comedy \u2014 in recent years, he hosted a YouTube show, \u201cCooking for Poor People,\u201d where he appeared shirtless under an apron bearing a picture of his own face and introduced each episode with the tagline: \u201cBecause when you\u2019re hungry, everything tastes good.\u201d (The show\u2019s theme song is a riff on his indelible bathroom scene from \u201cFriday.\u201d)\n\nWitherspoon\u2019s childhood poverty also influenced the actor\u2019s demanding work ethic. In a 2015 interview with \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d radio show, he said that \u201cworking and getting this paper\u201d was what kept him going well into his 70s. In an interview with Vlad TV last year, Witherspoon recalled the days he paid his rent six months in advance \u201cso if I\u2019m broke I still have a place to go home and sleep.\u201d The most recent episode of \u201cCooking for Poor People,\u201d published just Monday, opens with Witherspoon apologizing to fans for not posting a new video in a while, citing his involvement in the upcoming \u201cBoondocks\u201d reboot and \u201cLast Friday,\u201d the planned fourth installment of the \u201cFriday\u201d franchise.\n\nAs many fans lamented on social media Wednesday, Witherspoon\u2019s death puts his beloved roles in those projects in flux. Ice Cube, who co-wrote \u201cFriday\u201d and penned the film\u2019s two sequels, tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m devastated over the passing of John Witherspoon. Life won\u2019t be as funny without him.\u201d Aaron McGruder, who created \u201cThe Boondocks\u201d series and the comic strip on which it was based, told The Washington Post that \u201cJohn let me borrow his wonderful, magical voice \u2026 and now I\u2019ve lost part of my own. I will miss him as both fan and friend.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRegina King, who starred as Witherspoon\u2019s daughter in \u201cFriday\u201d and later lent her voice to his grandsons, Riley and Huey, in \u201cThe Boondocks,\u201d also honored the comedian on Twitter. \u201cMy dad, my grandpa, my comedic inspiration,\u201d she wrote above a GIF of the actor licking his fingers in a classic \u201cBoomerang\u201d scene. \u201cI love you Spoons! Rest In Paradise, King.\u201d\n\nOne of the most poignant tributes came from Witherspoon\u2019s real-life son, J.D., who followed his father into the entertainment business. The pair appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast earlier this year, where J.D. recalled that his dad\u2019s only advice for his foray into the industry that made him famous was that he \u201cbetter be funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d roast each other like homies more than Father & Son, and I really liked that,\u201d J.D. Witherspoon tweeted Wednesday. \u201cHe was my best friend & my idol.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo...my Dad died today & honestly I\u2019m not sure how to feel. I\u2019m sad, but I\u2019m also happy 4 all the great times we had together. We\u2019d roast each other like homies more than Father & Son, and I really liked that. He was my best friend & my idol.\n\n\n\nLove U Dad...I\u2019ll miss u.\n\n\n\n- J.D. pic.twitter.com/zvzep5S11I \u2014 J.D.
