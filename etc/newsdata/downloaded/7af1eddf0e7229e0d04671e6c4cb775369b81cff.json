Selling insights and access to loyalty scheme members are becoming increasing sources of revenue,\" ACCC chair Rod Sims said.\n\nSee also: 3 things businesses need to know about customer privacy expectations (TechRepublic)\n\nIn addition, the ACCC has also made a draft recommendation for loyalty schemes to improve data practices, suggesting that companies need to review their approach to presenting consumers with information about how consumer data is handled, as well as provide consumers with more control over their data.\n\nSpecifically, the ACCC has recommended that loyalty schemes improve the clarity, accessibility, navigability, and readability of privacy policies; minimise information overload for consumers; end the practice of automatically linking customers' payment cards to their profile to track their purchasing; disclose to consumers the sources of third party advertising; and outline which entities consumer data is being shared and for what purposes.\n\nThe other draft recommendations that ACCC put forward as part of the report included the need for loyalty scheme operators to improve how they communicate with customers to ensure they are given adequate notice of any changes and for Australian consumer law to be amended to prohibit unfair contract terms and certain unfair trading practices.\n\nThe ACCC is seeking comments on the draft report until 3 October 2019, with plans to release a final report in late 2019.\n\nThe ACCC findings from this draft report reinforce similar recommendations that were made by the ACCC in its Digital Platforms Inquiry Final Report, which highlighted how Australians are still in the dark when it comes to the extent of the collection and use of their data by companies such as Facebook.\n\nRelated Coverage\n\nConsent removed from Australia's proposed data-sharing legislation\n\nThe National Data Commissioner won't be able to prevent data from being shared, rather they are tasked with capabilities to 'encourage' data custodians and accredited users to 'safely and respectfully share personal information'.\n\nAustralia's consumer energy data to be made open under CDR\n\nConsumers will soon be able to easily compare and switch energy service providers.\n\nAustralia's Consumer Data Right to finally make its way through Parliament\n\nLegislation to be passed nearly two years after the new regime was officially announced.\n\nCalls for legislative change to limit citizen vehicle data collection and use in Australia\n\nThe National Transport Commission has asked for a reform, requiring states and territories to agree to broad principles on limiting government collection, use, and disclosure of automated vehicle data.\n\nAustralian privacy law amendments to cover data collection and use by digital platforms\n\nThe fine print offered by the likes of Facebook will no longer be good enough to collect and use the data of Australians.", "description": "To protect the data rights and privacy of consumers when it comes to customer loyalty schemes.", "authors": ["Aimee Chanthadavong"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/11/19/ca593115-203c-45b3-b7c9-59f1d20586bd/thumbnail/770x578/0feb00ca3e4a1d26409dec15260b8496/istock-880499484.jpg"}
