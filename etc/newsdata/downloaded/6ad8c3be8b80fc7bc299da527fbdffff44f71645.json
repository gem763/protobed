Schumer, meanwhile, said it was Republicans who were acting in a \u201ctotally partisan\u201d way by trying to include additional money for the wall.\n\n\u201cIt appears that Republicans are pursuing the same path that led to last year\u2019s 35-day government shutdown \u2014 funding the president\u2019s controversial, ineffective wall no matter the cost to the American people,\u201d Mr. Schumer and other Democrats wrote in a letter on Tuesday to Mr. McConnell and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, Alabama Republican.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House could advance a stopgap bill later this week that would temporarily extend funding past the looming Sept. 30 deadline to give lawmakers more time to negotiate the bigger fights, though it\u2019s not clear if Mr. McConnell would simply take up that bill or try to amend it.\n\nMr. Schumer told reporters Tuesday that Democrats would be satisfied to pass a \u201cclean\u201d short-term spending bill and kick larger fights over topics such as the border wall to later in the year.\n\n\u201cThe place to make those points, and we will be making them strongly, is in the larger appropriations bill,\u201d he said.\n\nA standoff over the wall last year helped send the federal government into its longest-ever shutdown that stretched from December into January, after both sides refused to budge on wall money.\n\nOver the summer, both parties signed off on a two-year budget deal that allows Congress to spend about $320 billion over what\u2019s allowed under current law, as lawmakers managed to come together on one of the few remaining bipartisan initiatives on Capitol Hill: spending money.\n\nBut lawmakers still have to pass bills that actually appropriate the funds to avoid triggering another shutdown.\n\nDemocrats are incensed after the president told Congress this month that he would use his emergency powers to divert $3.6 billion in Pentagon funds to building the wall.\n\nDemocrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee unsuccessfully tried to attach an amendment to a nearly $700 billion defense spending bill the panel cleared last week that would have prohibited any Pentagon funds from being allocated to projects on the southern border.\n\n\u201cEvery one of us wants a secure border, but we\u2019re appropriators,\u201d Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, the top Democrat on the committee, told the panel.\n\nIn addition to the ever-present battles over the wall, lawmakers also will have to wade through other perennial sticking points in spending bills, such as abortion.\n\nDemocrats have pushed for language in spending legislation that would undermine the president\u2019s expanded \u201cMexico City Policy\u201d that prevents money from going to overseas groups that promote or perform abortions, while Republicans say that\u2019s a nonstarter.\n\n\u2022 Lauren Meier contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
