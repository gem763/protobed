They were very wrong and will now pay the price for their actions.\u2019\n\nChristina Smith of the CPS said: \u2018These two rapists have at every turn denied responsibility for their sickening actions.\n\n\u2018They took advantage of a vulnerable woman, who had clearly lost the capacity to consent to sexual activity.\n\n\u2018They ushered her into a room, raped her, discarded her and then ran away from the scene of their crime in callous celebration.\n\n\u2018The victim has shown immense courage in coming forward and we hope these convictions provide her with some comfort.\n\n\u2018We hope this serves as a very strong reminder that anyone who takes advantage of another who, for whatever reason, is unable to consent faces prosecution for their actions.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
