That price tag is likely to keep growing as more abortion restrictions are challenged, including three in federal courts today.\n\nIn an effort to overturn Roe v. Wade, these states are passing laws that severely limit or prohibit abortion, hoping that the courts will uphold them. But when, instead, those new laws are thrown out, the state has to pay the legal expenses for the abortion advocates. That puts taxpayers in the position of having to pay for the attorneys on both sides of abortion battles that often last for years.\n\nThis is the result of a special provision that allows the courts to order reimbursement to people who successfully challenge laws that violate civil rights.\n\nThe latest \u2014 and by far largest \u2014 recent reimbursement was ordered by a federal judge in Texas last month, awarding $2.3 million to the lawyers who successfully blocked a state law to limit abortions.\n\nIn the last four years, states have paid at least $9.8 million in abortion providers\u2019 attorneys fees When abortion limits are overturned, the courts can order states to pay the lawyers for the other side.

Both parties are culpable in driving the cost of this litigation to an extreme height, with the people of the State of Texas left to pay all of the expense of both sides.\u201d\n\nWomen in poverty bear the greatest burden of poverty restrictions\n\nThe clinic challenged a 2013 law that required doctors to have admitting privileges in a local hospital and required abortion clinics to be equipped as outpatient surgical centers. The Supreme Court ruled in the clinic\u2019s favor in 2016.\n\n\n\nAbortion rights advocates celebrate outside the Supreme Court in June 2016 after the court's ruling in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt. (Michael Reynolds/EPA)\n\nThe lawyers for Whole Women\u2019s Health sought $4.5 million for 6,044 hours of work for the case, with hourly billing rates ranging from $265 to $995, for an average of $740.\n\nThe state claimed that the rates were too high, the bills were vague and the hours were excessive.\n\nAfter reviewing the objections, Yeakel approved 5,745 hours of work and said a fair average price to pay for a lawyer in Austin was $400 an hour.\n\nWith Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s appointments to the Supreme Court, states have rushed to pass additional restrictions that, if upheld, would overturn the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that created a constitutional right to abortion nationwide.\n\nA trial starts today over a two-day waiting period for abortions in Tennessee, and a federal court in Atlanta will hear arguments over a new Georgia law that would forbid abortion after six weeks. In San Francisco, a federal court will hear arguments from Planned Parenthood over the Trump administration\u2019s rules on what doctors must tell pregnant women.\n\n\n\nPeople wait Aug. 12 in Nashville for the start of a Tennessee state Senate hearing on a \"fetal heartbeat\" abortion ban. (Mark Humphrey/AP)\n\nHow often does the Supreme Court overturn precedents on civil rights?\n\nStates are trying to limit the financial burden with novel strategies. Several recent abortion laws included a \u201ctrigger\u201d provision that the law would not go into effect until a similar law had been upheld in another state or the Supreme Court had overturned Roe. If the new restrictions don\u2019t go into effect, the state doesn\u2019t have to defend them in court.\n\nCritics of the laws have said that the costs of the states\u2019 own lawyers, plus their outside legal counsel, and the attorneys fees awarded to the other side could all be used instead to promote the health of children and pregnant women.\n\nThey pointed to a 2017 study by the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health that indicates that states that pass more abortion restrictions have worse health outcomes for women and children.\n\nNew laws are widening the gap in access to abortion\n\nAlthough the Center for Reproductive Rights was part of the legal team that received the $2.3 million reimbursement award in Texas, senior staff attorney Jenny Ma said the money should be going elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThe saddest part is that these states are spending hard-earned taxpayer money defending lawsuits,\u201d Ma said, \u201cwhen they could be using those funds to support their citizens.\u201d", "description": "In the last four years, taxpayers in states trying to restrict abortion access have paid almost $10 million in attorney fees for abortion providers.
