There is overwhelming evidence that Pakistan only held the money as a trustee and it actually belonged to the Nizam,\" Paul Hewitt, the lawyer for one of the grandsons told the BBC's Gaggan Sabherwal.\n\nMr Hewitt said the case, which had begun when his client was a child, was finally being resolved when he was in his 80s.\n\n\"We welcome the judgment of Justice Marcus Smith,\" Najaf Ali Khan, one of the Nizam's grandsons told BBC Telugu.\n\n\"The High Court has rightly rejected Pakistan's claim. The family has long awaited this judgement.\"\n\nIndia's foreign ministry also welcomed the verdict in a press statement.\n\nPakistan could potentially ask for permission to appeal, but unless that is granted, the money will be given to the Nizam's grandsons and the state of India.", "description": "The origins of the dispute over the depositing of \u00a31m go back to the partitioning of British India.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2E52/production/_103285811_gettyimages-173312154-1.jpg"}
