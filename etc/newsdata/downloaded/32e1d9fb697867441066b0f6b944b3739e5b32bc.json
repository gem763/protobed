Of Cindy Brady, in fact.\n\nWell, it\u2019s of Susan Olsen, who nearly 50 years ago to the day made her debut as the precocious youngest of the The Brady Bunch. So yes, here\u2019s the story of a lovely lady, Susan Olsen, but of so much more: Earth, Wind & Fire; the Wienermobile; and a group of shell-shocked tourists you could have knocked over with a feather.\n\nIt was 2011, and Olsen got a call from Ailee Willis, who co-wrote several of Earth, Wind & Fire\u2019s hits and is a friend\u2014\u201cdon\u2019t ask me how.\u201d From the other end of the line, Willis says, \u201cI have the Wienermobile tomorrow.\u201d\n\nOlsen is the kind of person who just accepts such things at face value. She explains how, the next day, she found herself in a hot dog-shaped, Oscar Mayer-branded automobile near Studio City, Los Angeles. She even scrolls through her phone to find photos to show me.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

Olsen mentioned that she had never been to the house. The show had filmed on a studio set, after all. \u201cWell,\u201d Willis said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\nOlsen gives a eureka yelp. She\u2019s found it. She hands her phone over to me and, there she is, standing on the street next to the Wienermobile, a gathered crowd with mouths agape to her left and, looming behind it all, the 1959 split-level home that became the symbol of 1970s groovy Americana and wholesome family values, thanks to its recurring role on the show.\n\n\u201cAilee says to her dying day she will never forget people\u2019s faces when the Wienermobile pulls up and Cindy Brady walks out,\u201d Olsen says, cackling as she remembers the scene.\n\nBehind only the White House, the building on 11222 Dilling Street is the second most-photographed home in America, hence the tourists there, bowled over by the surreal sight\u2014as perfect a first time as could have been orchestrated for Olsen to visit the attraction. In recent months, however, Olsen as well as her Brady siblings\u2014Barry Williams (Greg), Maureen McCormick (Marcia), Christopher Knight (Peter), Eve Plumb (Jan), and Mike Lookinland (Bobby)\u2014have been regular fixtures at the landmark.\n\nDespite having mixed feelings about spending the last five decades living double lives as \u201ca Brady,\u201d the six surviving members of America\u2019s platonic ideal of a blended family reunited to participate in the HGTV event series A Very Brady Renovation, premiering Sept. 9.\n\nOnly Williams has been inside the house before. After the original show was canceled, he was invited to lunch at a house in the Valley, only to find everyone else at the table leering and snickering at him. \u201cDon\u2019t you know where you are?\u201d one said. It\u2019s only after they walked him back outside to look at the exterior that he realized he was at the Brady house.\n\nIn addition to Olsen, Lookinland and Knight have been to the house. Knight remembers the bizarre experience of seeing the woman who owned the house walk out in her bathrobe to turn on the sprinklers while carrying a white poster board on a stick to shield her face from the tourists on the street.\n\nSuffice it to say, the pandemonium outside reached a different level when the entire surviving Brady clan arrived to film the renovations.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare occasion that all six Bradys have agreed to a nostalgia-soaked reunion like this. Resistance to being continually associated with their iconic characters usually keeps at least one of the core cast away from most projects over the years.\n\nMcCormick, for example declined to participate in the 1990 sequel series, The Bradys, while Plumb\u2019s absence from The Brady Bunch Hour variety show led to the invention of \u201cFake Jan Day,\u201d celebrated on Jan. 2 in honor of the actress who stepped in to play the middle daughter, Geri Reischl, aka \u201cJan 2.\u201d\n\nBut after HGTV purchased the house last summer and developed the idea to draft its biggest network stars\u2014Property Brothers' Jonathan and Drew Scott and Restored By the Fords\u2019 Leanne and Steve Ford among them\u2014to help renovate it, each of the original cast members accepted the invitation to participate in the series as well.\n\nThough some of the sextet have left the business entirely, half no longer live on the west coast, and all have gone through some uneasy moments tied to their Brady-minted fame, they all agreed that this project, with this house, pegged to this monumental anniversary was worthwhile. (The first episode of The Brady Bunch premiered Sept. 26, 1969.)\n\n\u201cThis is the first time the magic is back,\u201d Olsen tells me about the unlikely reunion.\n\nThat\u2019s how the Bradys found themselves not only renovating a warped version of the childhood home, but also blanketing programming across the suite of channels owned by Discovery Networks, including HGTV and the Food Network. And that\u2019s how I found myself talking to Olsen, McCormick, and Knight\u2014Cindy, Marcia, and Greg\u2014about their lives as Bradys until, later, Williams, Plumb, and Lookinland crash the conversation to deliver tutorials on getting good hair plugs and nose jobs. (Talk about surreal\u2026)\n\nThey all marvel over the fact that this project, so perfectly timed to 50 years, was born out of happenstance.\n\nThe iconic house was put on the market last year, kicking off a bidding war that included none other than former pop star Lance Bass. But seeing television potential in the home, HGTV bid Bass out of contention, securing the home for a reported $3.5 million, nearly double the $1.9 million asking price.\n\nMcCormick had seriously considered bidding on the home, until she heard Bass was involved and figured she didn\u2019t stand a chance against his NSYNC wallet. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want it to get the wrecking ball,\u201d Olsen says. \u201cI was sad Lance Bass didn\u2019t get it because I knew he would love it.\u201d But when they found out that it was HGTV which had scooped it from the singer, they all felt a tingling suspicion that something was about to happen in their own lives, too.\n\n\u201cI thought they must have something up their sleeve,\u201d Knight says. \u201cWhat are they going to spin out of this?\u201d Adds McCormick: \u201cAnd are they going to call us?\u201d\n\nThe life of a Brady isn\u2019t an easy one.\n\nWhen the series premiered in 1969, Olsen was only 8 years old. Lookinland was 7. The oldest of the Brady siblings, even Williams was only 14 at the time. That\u2019s a formative period in a person\u2019s life to rocket-blast to fame as the most prominent siblings in Hollywood certainly then, perhaps even before, and arguably since. It\u2019s a precarious time to be identified with your pigtails and your lisp, middle-child angst, or the televised representation of puberty and awkward teenage hormones.\n\n(Olsen jokes that she was so traumatized at a young age by being branded forever a tattle-tale and bullied because of the famous Brady Bunch episode that she has vowed to take any secret ever she\u2019s ever been told to the grave.)\n\nIt tracks, then, that, for all the lucrative opportunities that mined or sometimes exploited Brady nostalgia in the years since, the young actors were desperate to leave their Brady identities behind when they finally moved on from the show.\n\n\u201c There is a passage of time and behavior to get close to someone normally. But not for us. All of a sudden we\u2019re a member of their family. They know you, they think. You have no idea who they are. \u201d\n\n\u201cIt never ended,\u201d Knight says, feigning exasperation\u2014or maybe not really feigning at all\u2014when I ask if he\u2019s surprised that, 50 years later, people are still this interested in them simply because they were on The Brady Bunch as kids. \u201cThere was a time when it was very frustrating,\u201d he laughs, the kind of laugh that is almost unsettlingly serious.\n\n\u201cFor everyone,\u201d Olsen chimes in, Knight nodding as a lifetime seemed to flash in front his eyes. \u201cThere were some years\u2026\u201d he says ominously.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been all through our frustrations with it,\u201d McCormick says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a member of someone\u2019s family by extension,\u201d Knight says. \u201cThat\u2019s been the hardest thing to get used to. It\u2019s taken 50 years because I\u2019m still not completely used to it. There is a passage of time and behavior to get close to someone normally. But not for us. All of a sudden we\u2019re a member of their family. They know you, they think. You have no idea who they are.\u201d\n\nOlsen calls it an altered reality. \u201cOn a subconscious level, people might just be nicer to me because they think they have a kind feeling towards me because they think we grew up together.\u201d\n\nMcCormick confesses that it took years\u2014decades, really\u2014to get to a point of appreciation rather than resentment, but she\u2019s happier for it. \u201cI think honestly it\u2019s so great when we can get to the point where you can totally embrace it. There\u2019s so much love within this show and what it\u2019s about and the whole thing. It\u2019s incredible to be a part of that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s inevitable that young actors would sprint away from a seemingly inescapable gee-golly image at some point, especially if that image is preventing them from working. McCormick says \u201cthe hardest part\u201d was not being offered or even seen for roles because she was typecast as Marcia Brady, citing Midnight Express as a specific film she wasn\u2019t cast in because of her \u201cMarcia connection.\u201d Despite training at the American Academy of the Dramatic Arts, Olsen quit acting after Cindy Brady became too much of a liability in audition rooms.\n\n\u201cI was definitely not proud [of the show],\u201d Olsen says. \u201cThere was so little respect for the show. Oh, you were on that show.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a chasm between the audience and the industry of artists,\u201d Knight says. \u201cYou wanted their respect, and this was not something that you would get at all.\u201d Even his parents hated the show. \u201cThey thought it was banal.\u201d\n\nThere were off-screen demons to wrestle with as well. McCormick has been outspoken about becoming addicted to cocaine at age 18 and the depression that followed, eventually appearing on Vh1\u2019s Celebrity Fit Club to work off the weight she had gained. Knight made scores of headlines and was even given his own reality series after starting a relationship with model Adrianne Curry, who was 25 years his junior, after the two met on the Vh1 series The Surreal Life.\n\n\u201c On a subconscious level, people might just be nicer to me because they think they have a kind feeling towards me because they think we grew up together. \u201d\n\nIt goes without saying that they\u2019ve all come out the other side, and have been on it for years. In that respect, A Very Brady Renovation is a welcome reminder that you can go home again\u2014whatever that means to you.\n\nAt what point did they decide to embrace being a Brady? \u201cLast year,\u201d Olsen says, letting out a hearty laugh.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that their TV siblings arrive alongside Discovery CEO David Zaslav. It\u2019s remarkable to see how quickly and naturally they slip into schmooze-and-banter mode when the executive shows up. It\u2019s as if they\u2019d been trained all their lives in the practice...\n\nZaslav is talking up all the big plans he has for the six of them. \u201cCan\u2019t we do something great for Christmas? We gotta do more.\u201d\n\nKnight playfully points to my recorder, alerting him to the journalist present. \u201cAnybody see Almost Famous?\u201d Zaslav says, quoting the movie: \u201cWe\u2019re talking in front of the one guy we shouldn\u2019t be talking in front of.\u201d\n\nHe touts the plan to promote A Very Brady Renovation across the entire suite of networks, while reminiscing with Williams, Plumb, and the rest of the siblings about Columbo, The Love Boat, The Monkees and the other classic shows of the Brady Bunch era they all still love. It\u2019s here that he remarks at how great Williams and Knight look, as if they\u2019ve \u201cnever lost a hair on their head.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called micrographing,\u201d Knight says, launching into a detailed explanation of how the process works and the science of follicles with little vanity as Williams nods along: \u201cIt\u2019s called looking good.\u201d Knight continues to brag. \u201cNot a one you can tell was planted.\u201d\n\nAll the girls coo in agreement, as the conversation continues to other examples of undetectable plastic surgery. Olsen volunteers her own nose job as an example. \u201cThey can\u2019t tell with me. I\u2019ve had four of them. It kept growing back. I looked like I had a potato on my face. They had to do it four times because it kept growing back. I\u2019m like a starfish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looks great, Susan,\u201d McCormick says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of it,\u201d Olsen says, \u201cso I like to let people know.\u201d\n\nAnd with that trippy reminder of age and the passage of time amid a conversation about nostalgia and the past, the Bradys are off to do more press, where they\u2019re asked to reflect on their childhoods, what\u2019s changed, and what they\u2019re up to now.\n\nMcCormick and Plumb still act. Knight owns a furniture business. Olsen hosts a radio show, teaches acting, and is an artist. Williams lives in the Ozarks, where he plays in a band. Lookinland is in Salt Lake City selling concrete countertops. \u201cWe were right in thinking that this was the right thing to do,\u201d Olsen says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s proven to be a path with heart.\u201d\n\nThe entire time they walk down the hallway together, they are recognized. People gasp, coo, and smile. \u201cIt\u2019s so new to us,\u201d Knight cracked the first time I noticed all the attention they were getting, smiling politely, as if it\u2019s instinct, and nodding at the well-wisher across the room. \u201cFirst time that\u2019s ever happened\u2026\u201d", "description": "The six surviving members of the iconic TV family once resented fame.
