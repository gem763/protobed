But Nunes, in a Friday letter obtained by Fox News, questions that assumption, saying Mueller\u2019s report \u201comits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals.\u201d\n\nSPECULATION RAGES OVER PAPADOPOULOS TIPSTER'S ROLE\n\nMifsud is a crucial figure in the report: Mueller\u2019s report states that Mifsud was the one who told Papadopoulos in April 2016 that the Russians had \u201cdirt\u201d in the form of emails that could damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAs the story goes, Papadopoulos then told Australian diplomat Alexander Downer about his conversations with Mifsud. Downer then informed U.S. officials, leading the FBI to open its investigation into whether Trump associates were coordinating with Russia during the 2016 election.\n\nNunes also is seeking information about the FBI\u2019s contacts with Mifsud \u2013 asking how the bureau knew to question Papadopoulos specifically about Clinton\u2019s emails if it hadn\u2019t already spoken to Mifsud. The congressman said, \u201cit\u2019s still a mystery how the FBI knew to ask Papadopoulos specifically about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails\u2026\u201d\n\nNunes\u2019 letter is addressed to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone and FBI Director Chris Wray. It asks them to hand over all information they have on Mifsud by May 10.\n\nIn his letter, Nunes presents photographic evidence of Mifsud in close proximity to influential Western political and government officials.\n\n\u201cIf Mifsud has extensive, suspicious contacts among Russian officials as portrayed in the special counsel\u2019s report, then an incredibly wide range of Western institutions and individuals may have been compromised by him, including our own State Department,\u201d Nunes wrote.\n\nHe added: \u201cIn fact, this could entail a major scandal for U.S. and allied governments.\u201d\n\nAlternatively, Nunes wrote that if Mifsud isn\u2019t a counterintelligence threat, as implied in the Mueller report, he could have done extensive damage to Western national security. The California Republican wrote that if that\u2019s the case, it \u201cwould cast doubt on the Special Counsel\u2019s fundamental depiction of him and his activities, and raise questions about the veracity of the Special Counsel\u2019s statements and affirmations.\u201d\n\nThe State Department and the FBI declined to comment. Fox News has also requested comment from the CIA and the National Security Agency.\n\nMifsud has vanished from public eye after his name began surfacing in news stories.", "description": "House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes is scrutinizing the findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report about Joseph Mifsud -- the mysterious professor from Malta who helped ignite the Russia probe in 2016 \u2013 and wants to know exactly who he was working for when he spoke with former Trump adviser George Papadopoulos .", "authors": ["Catherine Herridge", "Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "Based In Washington", "D.C.
