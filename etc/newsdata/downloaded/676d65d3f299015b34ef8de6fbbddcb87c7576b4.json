For the English contingent it is farewell, folks, to their Disney resort base while the Springboks say konnichiwa again to Mickey and Minnie Mouse.\n\nThese things are not entirely scientific but living next to the Magic Kingdom did not do Eddie Jones\u2019s squad any harm last week.\n\nEngland\u2019s response to the haka should be encouraged, not penalised | Liam Napier Read more\n\nWhile the Springboks\u2019 management will hope the same spell is cast upon them in the build-up to Saturday\u2019s final, they also know the alchemist-in-chief has relocated across town. Jones has already experienced two World Cup finals as a coach and the Australian knows precisely which buttons need pressing this week.\n\nIt is his firm belief, for a start, that no one ever needs motivating in the lead up to a World Cup final. Jones took Australia to within a Jonny Wilkinson drop-goal of beating England in 2003 and helped South Africa over the line as a hastily-recruited consultant in 2007; both campaigns taught him that, in final week, less is more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always about doing less. Coaches tend to think they\u2019ve got to do more but it\u2019s about making sure we don\u2019t over-coach the players and let them find their own rhythms.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing certain things right, keeping the players fresh physically, keeping them fresh mentally, making sure they have enough to do off the field. We need to make sure they\u2019re physically fresh and mentally clear, have the game plan in their head, know how they want to play and are aware of the challenges ahead. Our players will be ready to go.\u201d\n\nIt was equally instructive to hear Jones argue that, far from easing up, he thinks England can raise their level again this Saturday. If that sounds improbable given the staggering effort that went into beating the All Blacks, he reckons the intense fitness regime they have undergone since the summer is now paying off. \u201cThe great thing about our players is that, physically, they are in fantastic condition. Their ability to recover is extraordinary. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to say our training\u2019s going to be to a higher standard this week than it was last week. That\u2019s how good a condition we are in.\n\n\u201cLook, we played a great team on Saturday but we don\u2019t feel we\u2019ve played as well as we can. The challenge for us is to keep improving. As you go through the tournament, the margins get smaller but the improvements you can make are still significant. We\u2019re looking to see how we can keep improving for this week\u2019s game and that\u2019s the exciting part for us.\u201d\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nWith Jones there can often be a touch of judicious top spin \u2013 he was once a decent off-spinner back in Randwick \u2013 but self-belief is now oozing from every English pore. New Zealand could find no way back in Yokohama partly because England kept on coming.\n\nTom Curry, Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola all played the full 80 minutes yet already look in more than decent shape again. \u201cThe big thing for us is holding back the players this week and making sure they don\u2019t go before the siren rings,\u201d said Jones.\n\nEngland's Eddie Jones hits back at Gatland: 'Enjoy the third-place play-off' Read more\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we can be fairly relaxed this week. We\u2019ve done a lot of hard work, we know what\u2019s ahead of us, we know we can play to our strengths and we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of what we take away from the Springboks game [against Wales]. The only thing we are really worried about is how the Springboks turn up on Saturday. They won a tough semi-final and when you are in the final of a World Cup, you have done a lot of things right.\u201d\n\nNor is Jones in much doubt as to how Rassie Erasmus\u2019s side will look to confront England. \u201cThey are a massively aggressive, physical forward pack and they probably played their stronger team in the second half as opposed to the first. There are not many Springbok teams that don\u2019t come through the front door. So we\u2019ve got to be ready at the front door and have enough cover at the back door, too. Rassie is a cunning coach and has done a great job with the Springboks. We\u2019re prepared for the unexpected \u2026 they are going to be a difficult side to beat.\u201d\n\nWorking in England\u2019s favour, though, is something Erasmus can do absolutely nothing about. While Jones\u2019s popularity with the Japanese public was already stratospheric prior to the tournament, the All Blacks\u2019 semi-final demise has now guaranteed England further neutral support. Jones, in addition, says his squad want to give the country \u2013 or at least the English part of the UK \u2013 another boost at a time of significant political turmoil. \u201cWith Brexit at the moment they probably need something to cheer about. It\u2019s a job of the team to make the country happy.\u201d A tense World Cup final may await but Jones has rarely sounded so completely at ease.", "description": "England\u2019s head coach has been here before and will not over-exert his players this week but admits aggressive South Africa will be \u2018a difficult side to beat\u2019 in Saturday\u2019s World Cup final", "authors": ["Robert Kitson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/396a584214f09dedd235361cd0c75029d6a48d97/779_266_3684_2211/master/3684.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3fc91f53505fdfa9fb9c72ef1c28ca3b", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
