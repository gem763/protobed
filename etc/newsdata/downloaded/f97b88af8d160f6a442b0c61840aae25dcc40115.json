The Echo Buds, for example, will let users make calls, order an Uber, and ping Siri or Alexa to play music. The Loop will let you ask Alexa which items are in stock at your local Whole Foods.\n\nRead: The Amazon-ification of Whole Foods\n\nMost likely, they\u2019ll be hugely popular, even though Amazon has had a slew of recent privacy scandals. In January, The Intercept found that human reviewers watch video clips of users\u2019 houses recorded by Amazon Ring products. In April, Bloomberg revealed that human reviewers listen in on audio clips sent from Alexa-enabled speakers. A series of expos\u00e9s from CNET and Vice revealed that police departments keep registries of Amazon Ring owners. Yet customers keep buying what Amazon\u2019s selling.

But Amazon has a solution: still more products, more ways to be notified. The company\u2019s play to survive the tech backlash is to double down.\n\nAnyone who uses tech has already given up some privacy as the cost of admission to our efficient, mobile world, with all its pings, dings, and buzzes. If you already have Siri on your phone or Alexa speakers in your apartment, the wearable version seems like a smaller personal cost to privacy, especially if it lets you compete more effectively with your peers in the contest of always-on-ness.
