(Image: The CW)\n\nThe Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover is turning into a monumental experience. One that not only involves all of the Arrowverse shows the CW has to offer but is also bringing in characters from DC movies and TV shows past \u2014 including Smallville\u2019s Tom Welling and Erica Durance, who played Superman and Lois Lane. But if you\u2019re hoping for a villainous reunion, it\u2019s not going to happen.\n\nMichael Rosenbaum, who played Clark Kent\u2019s friend-turned-nemesis Lex Luthor on Smallville, released a statement on Twitter saying he was offered a part in Crisis on Infinite Earths but chose to turn it down.\n\nAccording to Rosenbaum, he chose not to join his former co-stars, as well as the likes of other Supermen like Brandon Routh and Tyler Hoechlin, because the timing was bad and the studio wasn\u2019t giving him any information about the project. Here\u2019s a section from his statement:\n\nI\u2019ll just be straight up about this. WB called my agents Friday afternoon when I was in Florida visiting my grandfather in a nursing home. Their offer: No Script. No idea what I\u2019m doing. No idea when I\u2019m shooting. Basically no money. And the real kick in the arse \u201cWe have to know now.\u201d My simple answer was \u201cPass.\u201d I think you can understand why.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Lex Luthor is going to be MIA from Crisis on Infinite Earths. Jon Cryer will be reprising his version of the role as seen on Supergirl. He comes in addition to the lollapalooza of characters being brought into the fold for this epic crossover, including Jonah Hex, Kevin Conroy as a live-action version of Bruce Wayne, Burt Ward and the heroes of Black Lightning. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll learn of even more cameos, crossovers, and surprises as we get closer to the debut.\n\nCrisis on Infinite Earths launches this December, with three episodes of the five-part event coming out this year, and the other two in January 2020. So far, it's not confirmed when exactly the crossover will air in Australia.", "description": "The Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover is turning into a monumental experience.
