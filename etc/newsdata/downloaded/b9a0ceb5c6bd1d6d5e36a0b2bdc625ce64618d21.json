Instead, Trump said his NAFTA-replacement trade deal with Mexico and Canada will somehow pay for it.\n\n\"I often stated, 'One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.'\" Trump tweeted. \"This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!\"\n\nTrump's USMCA deal does secure some key gains for the US in its trade relationship with both the Canada and Mexico, but it does not resemble a payment from Mexico to the US.\n\nTrump voiced a similar sentiment in a testy meeting with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Pelosi pushed back on that idea as a waste and a disingenuous use of revenues from the deal.\n\nRead more: Trump inexplicably told Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi that Mexico would pay for the border wall as part of the landmark new trade deal\n\nPresident Donald Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Vice President Mike Pence in the Oval Office on Tuesday.

For example, 40% of each car must be produced by workers making $16 an hour or more to avoid cross-border duties, likely boosting the US and Canada's prospect to host those jobs as their industries can pay higher wages. Also, Mexico agreed to allow imports of certain US cheeses.\n\nOtherwise, the USMCA is very similar to NAFTA. And while Mexican industries may now have to pay some duties to the US, the revenue the US could get likely would take the form of taxes levied on workers and goods sold.\n\nRead more: The US, Canada, and Mexico's newly signed trade pact looks a lot like NAFTA. Here are the key differences between them.\n\nTrump has requested $5 billion in funding for the wall, but Democrats, arguing the wall is unnecessary and ineffective to stop illegal border crossings, want to stick to $1.3 billion for border security funding.\n\nPelosi previously told Business Insider that funding for Trump's wall is off the table, calling it \"immoral, ineffective, expensive.\"\n\nWhen announcing his campaign in 2015, Trump insisted the US needed a border wall to keep out illegal immigrants. He accused Mexico of sending undesirable people such as rapists across the border and said the US' southern neighbor would pay for the wall.", "description": "President Donald Trump said Mexico won't send money for the wall.
