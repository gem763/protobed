Shares plunged in Europe as well, with a 3 per cent drop for the pan-European Stoxx 50 and a 3.2 per cent plunge for the FTSE 100.\n\nIt was the second straight session of heavy losses for the US stockmarket, with the Dow down around 900 points in two sessions.\n\n\"The concern is that manufacturing is slowing in the US,\" said Greg Bundy, chairman at Federation Asset Management.\n\n\"I think that it's given people a bit of an excuse to sell and we could see a few more days of selling from this point.\"\n\nMr Bundy is optimistic that central bank support will place a floor under broad market selling but is concerned about the prospects for the Australian banks.\n\n\"I am worried about the deterioration in credit and continued regulatory pressure.\" The individual investors that depend on the banks for dividend income are vulnerable, he said. \"At best I see small dividend cuts from the banks.\"\n\nThe big four banks were under pressure again on Thursday, with Commonwealth Bank down 2.4 per cent $77.69, National Australia Bank down 3.3 per cent at $28.07, Westpac down 2.7 per cent at $28.43 and ANZ down 3.1 per cent at $27.20.\n\nThe selling spread beyond the banks, however, with healthcare firm CSL, down 2.2 per cent at $229.41. Mining giant BHP fell 2.8 per cent to $35.30 and peer Rio Tinto dropped 3 per cent to $88.33.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGold miners were one bright spot, with Newcrest up 3.2 per cent at $35.64, Northern Star up 4.7 per cent at $11.81 and Evolution Mining up 3 per cent at $4.66. Gold - regarded as a place of safety in times of market turmoil - rallied $US2 to $US1501.47 an ounce.\n\n\"Concerns about a slowing in global growth are clearly rising,\" Nomura interest rate strategist Andrew Ticehurst. \"Markets are sensitive to any signs in the economic data that reinforces anxiety and we have seen some softness in data this week.\"\n\nNonetheless, it's a good environment for Australian government bonds with the Reserve Bank of Australia expected to deliver further policy accommodation, the strategist said.\n\n\"We are expecting more conventional easing and probably unconventional easing,\" he said. \"We have a constructive view on Australian government bonds, We think that yields can decline a bit further in the near term,\" he said.\n\nThe yield on the ten year Australian government bond fell to 0.92 per cent from 0.96 per cent, while the two-year government bond yield traded at 0.63 per cent, after touching a fresh record low on Wednesday.\n\nThe next key piece of data is the US non-farm payrolls data out on Friday. According to a Reuters survey, non-farm payrolls probably increased by 145,000 jobs in September, after rising 130,000 in August.", "description": "The selldown is \"exactly what you would expect from a market on assisted living,\" says  Tracey McNaughton at Wilsons Advisory.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/cf168c85c2bf0604735638bda74b70761906554b", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
