Every time he does something like this, he just makes himself look more terrible. I don\u2019t know that that incrementally convinces anyone not to vote for him, but he just proves himself to be a shitty human being every day.\u201d\n\n\u2026.musician @johnlegend, and his filthy mouthed wife, are talking now about how great it is \u2013 but I didn\u2019t see them around when we needed help getting it passed. \u201cAnchor\u201d@LesterHoltNBC doesn\u2019t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about\u2026. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 9, 2019\n\nOn the topic of impeachment, the pair believes that Trump and his family absolutely deserve to go to prison and here here, sis.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be jail time for him, for the whole family,\u201d says Teigen. \u201cI feel like he still gets away with everything if he gets out of his office. I know that his first tweet after he\u2019s impeached will be, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to be there anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nNext up, their friend Kim Kardashian\u2019s visit to the White House was raised.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cheap win for [Trump],\u201d says Legend. \u201cBut the people being granted clemency are real people with families. So even if the clemency is won through his celebrity-whore tendencies, it\u2019s still helpful for that family and that person. At the same time, he\u2019s locking kids in cages and he\u2019s a terrible human being\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be able to go in there and put whatever you hate about him aside to do this greater good for this person?\u201d says Teigen. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could physically muster that smile and handshake.\u201d\n\nAnd as for Kim\u2019s husband Kanye West, they seem to be on less than friendly terms with him.\n\n\u201cKanye, if he\u2019s for you, he\u2019s a very ardent marketer and cheerleader,\u201d says Legend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to disown Kanye because I still love him and love everything we\u2019ve done together creatively,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we were never the closest of friends.\u201d\n\nIn private texts that West later shared publicly, Legend seemed concerned about his friend\u2019s loyalty to Trump.\n\n\u201cI think what was always challenging about it was Kanye has never been political,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knows one way or another what policies of Trump\u2019s he likes. He just kind of embraced Trump\u2019s blow-it-all-up spirit and the energy of himself being countercultural in supporting him.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one hot tamale so I suggest you have a read over at Vanity Fair.", "description": "John Legend and Chrissy Teigen grace the new cover of Vanity Fair where they call out their feud with Kanye West, Kim Kardashian and Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Matt Galea"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-29-at-8.38.18-am.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
