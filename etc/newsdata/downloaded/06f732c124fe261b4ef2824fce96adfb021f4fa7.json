My entire team,\u201d said Griffin, who lost his father when he was 12 to brain cancer and likes to say it took an entire village to raise him.\n\n\u201cI learned you don\u2019t have to win. If you put all that pressure on yourself it can backfire. Thinking like that helps me take the pressure off.\u201d\n\nGriffin finished one stroke ahead of Scott Harrington and Mark Hubbard, who shot 67 and 69 respectively.\n\nChina\u2019s Zhang Xinjun and Austria\u2019s Sepp Straka were part of a group of five who tied for fourth. Zhang shot 66, Straka a 69 to finish at 11-under along with Harris English (66), Talor Gooch (69) and Carlos Ortiz (69).\n\nGriffin is the only player to finish in the top 20 in every PGA Tour tournament since the new season started last month and now leads the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nGriffin, who earned a two year exemption on the Tour with his win, was forced to play on the lower Korn Ferry Tour last year in an attempt to earn his PGA card. He won twice on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2018 and 2017 but never won an event as a college player.\n\nOn Sunday, he was locked in a battle in the back nine. He drained a 33 foot birdie putt on No. 16 to take the lead. He also made a par save on the 14th hole and two-putted up a ridge on 17 for another clutch par.\n\n\u201cI just felt calm. I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Griffin of his first win.\n\nStewart Cink closed with a 69 to finish in a tie for ninth at 10-under 278.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Six years ago, Lanto Griffin had less $200 in his bank account, so he decided to caddie for his friend and fellow pro golfer", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/6db861_american-lanto-griffin-raises-his-arms-on-18th-green-sinking-winning-putt-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
