Biden when it came to his son Hunter Biden\u2019s role in the Ukraine scandal.\n\n\u201cIf that were my sons that took this $168 million from this very questionable \u2026 energy company and they knew nothing about energy \u2014 he knew nothing about energy and has a bad track record, including getting thrown out of the Navy, even the way he got into the Navy is interesting in his position \u2014 if that were Don Jr. or Eric Trump, who are very outstanding young men, it would be the biggest story of the century,\u201d the president said.\n\nMr. Hannity asked, \u201cWhat does it say about the media? I agree with you.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump responded that the news media is \u201ccorrupt\u201d and then announced he would likely \u201cterminate\u201d the White House\u2019s subscriptions to the two newspapers.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times, which is a fake newspaper. We don\u2019t even want it in the White House anymore, we\u2019re gonna probably terminate that and The Washington Post. They\u2019re fake,\u201d he said.\n\nIn context, Mr. Trump didn\u2019t appear to threaten pulling the press access to the two newspapers, which have written numerous articles critical of his presidency.\n\nHowever, it was enough for Ted Boutrous, the attorney who represented CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta and Playboy\u2019s Brian Karem when their press credentials were pulled, to cry foul.\n\n\u201cMore compelling evidence, indeed another confession, that @realdonaldtrump and his team engage in content- and viewpoint- discrimination regarding certain (indeed many) members of the White House press corps, in plain violation of the First Amendment,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
