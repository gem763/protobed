Marco Rubio (R-FL) announced on Monday that he would introduce legislation to prohibit federal government pension plans from investing in Chinese stock.\n\nRubio\u2019s bill is a reaction to a fund delaying a tracking decision for an index provided by MSCI Inc.\n\nReuters reported on the development:\n\nRubio and a bipartisan group of senators have complained about specific companies included in the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Investable Market Index, which gives a 7.5% weighting to Chinese firms. The U.S. lawmakers say the targeted companies \u201cassist in the Chinese government\u2019s military activities, espionage, and human rights abuses, as well as many other Chinese companies that lack basic financial transparency.\u201d The lawmakers called on the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) to reverse its decision and use the index provided Thrift Savings Plan\u2019s (TSP) International Stock Fund.\n\nRubio said in a statement emailed to the press:\n\nIts clear the Board will not act in the best interests of the United States, reverse this misguided decision and protect our national interest, as well as those who serve it. That\u2019s why I will be introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure that federal retirement savings can never be a source of wealth funding the Chinese Communist Party at the expense of our nation\u2019s future prosperity.\n\nThe board said it will reconsider the matter at a November 13 meeting.\n\n\u201cThe TSP is a retirement savings plan for federal employees and members of the military,\u201d Reuters reported. \u201cAs of July 2019, TSP assets totaled around $599.5 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cMSCI previously responded to Rubio\u2019s criticisms, saying there was no U.S. law prohibiting an index company from creating an index containing Chinese securities,\u201d Reuters reported.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Sen.
