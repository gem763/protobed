Before England\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Norway the Daily Mail reported Neville was the top target of US Soccer for the vacant position having impressed Ellis.\n\nPhil Neville denies arrogance claims after England lose to Norway Read more\n\nNeville has been named on the shortlist alongside Ellis and Netherlands\u2019 coach, Sarina Wiegman, for the Fifa women\u2019s coach of the year award.\n\nHowever when asked about the alleged interest, Neville batted it away, telling BBC Sport: \u201cThere has been no approach.\u201d\n\nNeville is under contract with the Lionesses until 2021 and, at present, is committed to leading Team GB into the 2020 Olympics and England into a home European Championship finals in 2021.\n\nSpeaking after England took the lead only to concede twice in the second half, in front of a record crowd for the home side, he said: \u201cMy focus is on winning us a gold medal in the Olympics and beyond that. It\u2019s flattering because it means you are doing a good job, but my focus is England.\n\n\u201cI love this job, and we\u2019ve got a big job to do. We can see over the last two games that the work is still in progress and we\u2019ve still got a long way to go.\u201d\n\nHe responded similarly after the World Cup when asked of his long-term commitment to the Lionessessaying: \u201cYou read and listen to stories, and people say: \u2018What\u2019s the next move\u2019, but I can\u2019t think of a better job in football.\n\n\u201cI get an organisation that backs me, anything I want. I get a set of players that play to my tune and I\u2019ve got scope to improve, to make an impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m committed to the three-year project. I don\u2019t see another job that would give me what I\u2019m in now. As long as the FA back me the way they\u2019ve backed me, and the players show the same kind of thirst for learning, then I\u2019ll be here for the three years.\u201d", "description": "The England Women\u2019s manager Phil Neville says he is flattered by links to the US job", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c021e38852ad1d32a62e6343dfcfc1a1c6bed14/0_118_3494_2096/master/3494.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b5366e14851f1ad2e9442222f9ae5f3"}
