REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nFacing a protracted growth slowdown, the ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory on Thursday and relaunched fresh bond purchases with no scheduled end-date, a move that divided the normally collegial Governing Council.\n\nAlthough no vote was taken, sources with direct knowledge of the discussion said that over a third of policymakers opposed the fresh asset buys, pushed by outgoing ECB chief Mario Draghi, an unusually high figure for a body that normally strives for consensus.\n\n\u201cThis broad package of measures, in particular restarting the asset purchase programme, is disproportionate to the present economic conditions, and there are sound reasons to doubt its effectiveness,\u201d Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot, a frequent critic of the bank\u2019s ultra-easy monetary policy, said.\n\nWhile disagreements are frequent, ECB policymakers usually line up behind decisions and refrain from openly criticising its policy.\n\nBundesbank President Jens Weidmann, another key critic, also said the stimulus was excessive, and Thursday\u2019s decisions indicated that rates will stay low for a long time.\n\nGermans have been especially irked by negative ECB rates and mass-selling newspaper Bild portrayed Draghi as \u201cCount Draghila,\u201d a blood sucking vampire, who is sucking dry the bank accounts of German savers.\n\nKnot said the euro zone economy is running at full capacity, wages are increasing and that financing conditions are so easy, they do not impede the flow of credit.\n\n\u201cThere are increasing signs of scarcity of low-risk assets, distorted pricing in financial markets and excessive risk-seeking behaviour in the housing markets,\u201d added Knot, a member of the ECB\u2019s policy-setting Governing Council.\n\nAustrian central bank chief Robert Holzmann, meanwhile, said he was worried the ECB had made a mistake and that such a broad package should not have come before the bank\u2019s planned policy review, which could even see the inflation target lowered.\n\n\u201cThis (review) is something I had hoped the bank should have been doing before making this decision,\u201d Holzmann told Bloomberg TV.\n\n\u201cIt may be that 2% at the moment is out of reach and 1.5% also signifies stable prices, almost stable prices. So there is no need to ... use all the power you have in order to move up to 2% if the cost is too high,\u201d he added, referring to the ECB\u2019s inflation target of just below 2%.\n\nProviding a counterpoint to the hawks, Slovenian central bank chief Bostjan Vasle said the ECB remained ready to do even more if needed, as growth and inflation were both weak.", "description": "Conservative policymakers slammed the European Central Bank's lavish stimulus measures on Friday, voicing doubts about the need and effectiveness of a package that could consume most of the bank's remaining firepower.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429412029&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0X7", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
