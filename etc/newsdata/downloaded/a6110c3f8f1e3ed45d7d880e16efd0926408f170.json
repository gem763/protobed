I feel great because God has made me unique.\n\n\"I feel proud of my height.\n\n\"People here treat me like a celebrity. They think I am special.\n\n\"I feel I am God-gifted and he has plans for me. I am not disheartened.\n\n\"I know I am special and I will make record for being the tallest in the world.\"\n\n(Image: SYED WAQAR RIZVI / CATERS NEWS)\n\nBut the world's tallest man, at 8 ft 2.82 inches, is Sultan Kosen , a Turkish farmer.\n\nMuhammad, from Manshera, Pakistan, cannot fit into normal clothes and shoes. He also faces difficult commuting on public transport, such as buses, as his head touches the roof and the seats are too small for his elongated legs.\n\nThe man needs six metres of cloth to get a tunic-shirt made and wears size-15 shoes, also customised.\n\n\"I cannot wear branded clothes,\" he added.\n\n(Image: SYED WAQAR RIZVI / CATERS NEWS)\n\n(Image: SYED WAQAR RIZVI / CATERS NEWS)\n\n\"Every week, there is a new family who approach my parents for marriage.\n\n\"I tell them I need to find a job first before settling down. I am hopeful that I will find my soulmate.\n\n\"People might think I cannot work because of my built. But I am capable of working.\"\n\nMuhammad was only 5ft until when he was 16 - but suddenly started growing taller and within four years, he was 6ft4in.\n\n(Image: SYED WAQAR RIZVI / CATERS NEWS)\n\n(Image: SYED WAQAR RIZVI / CATERS NEWS)\n\nHis parents, father Akhtar Nawaz and mother Naseem Akhtar are average in height and so are his four sisters and two brothers who are all between 5ft 3in to 5ft 7in feet tall.\n\nMuhammad, however, has been growing taller. In the last few months, he has grown another three inches tall.\n\nHe said: \"I was 7ft 4in feet tall three months back but now I am 7ft 8in. I keep checking my height in three months and I have been growing taller and taller.\n\n\"I will be famous one day.\"", "description": "Muhammad Amin Tanoli, of Manshera, Pakistan, and who cannot fit into normal clothes and shoes, says he feels blessed to be \"unique\"", "authors": ["Taniya Dutta", "Image", "Syed Waqar Rizvi", "Caters News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551181.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_PAY-Tallest-Man-in-Pakistan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
