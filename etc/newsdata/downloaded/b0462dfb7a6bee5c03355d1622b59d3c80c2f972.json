Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and Florida Governor Rick DeSantis were all scheduled to speak at the event. But Huckabee Sanders and a source close to Trump Jr. denied either saw the video.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nBloomberg technology reporter William Turton surfaced a video matching the description from the Times on YouTube. The video appears to have been uploaded by YouTube account TheGeekzTeam in July 2018, and the account has posted other videos doctored to make it look like Trump is violently killing his enemies. Although Turton said he has not yet been able to confirm the YouTube video was the same one played at the conference, the details in the video as described by the Times line up, although portions like the Barack Obama interview at the end of the video were not reported to have been shown.\n\nIn the video, a man with Trump\u2019s head superimposed on his body goes into a building labeled the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d where people inside are labeled with logos of major news outlets including Vox, Politico, the Washington Post, HuffPost, ABC and NBC covering their heads. Trump then opens fire, killing numerous media outlets including Vox, Politico and NPR, in addition to activist group Black Lives Matter. The fake Trump begins his rampage using a gun but later switches to a wooden stake and a knife. Also in the video are Hillary Clinton, Maxine Waters, Bernie Sanders, Barack Obama, John McCain and Rosie O\u2019Donnell \u2014 all of them are slaughtered by the killer Trump. The mass murder ends with the president driving a wooden stake into the head of a person depicted as the church\u2019s minister with a CNN logo covering their face as DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cAll I Do Is Win\u201d plays in the background.\n\nThe footage, the Times said, was taken and doctored from a church massacre scene in the dark comedy \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency has been marked by criticism of the news media, and recently he has even been vocally critical of his beloved Fox News. The president himself has shared a video depicting himself as violent toward the media, tweeting out a doctored video of him body slamming a man with a CNN logo over his head in 2017. Trump has also turned his ire toward reporters during his political rallies, spurring his supporters to taunt and threaten members of the media covering him.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we are barely a year out from the tragic Capital Gazette shooting in Maryland that killed five of the newspaper\u2019s staff not to mention other recent mass shootings in churches, synagogues and mosques, videos like this are particularly dangerous, especially when they are broadcast at events even loosely affiliated with the president and on property he owns.\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
