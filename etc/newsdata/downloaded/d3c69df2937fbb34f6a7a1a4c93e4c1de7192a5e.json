Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) all went viral this past weekend for separate interviews that could be charitably described as \u201ctrain wrecks.\u201d\n\nNaturally, it was a major topic on Monday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe View.\u201d McCain had strong opinions about the way Trump\u2019s defenders tried to spin their interviews by attacking journalists and spitting out conspiracy theories.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re bringing up the Deep State, when you\u2019re blaming the media, you\u2019ve already lost,\u201d McCain said.\n\nBut she also called out the media for what she said is a double standard in coverage.\n\n\u201cI will say,\u201d McCain said, \u201cif any of the women on this show behaved the way some of the men were behaving, we would be hysterical maniac crazy bitches all over the internet, and these guys get away with behaving like that.\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s slam earned a lot of applause and co-host Sunny Hostin agreed heartily.\n\n\u201cThey have come undone,\u201d she added.\n\nBut McCain wasn\u2019t done.\n\n\u201cI was so angry,\u201d McCain said. \u201cBut the blatant sexism, the way some of these men are being covered and the way we\u2019re covered in the media \u2014 I was furious. I was, like, if any of us went on TV, dropping F-bombs, screaming into the camera in, like, this direct way with props behind us, we would all be fired.\u201d\n\nYou can see the complete segment below (McCain\u2019s comments start around 3:50).\n\nREPUBLICANS STRUGGLE TO DEFEND TRUMP: Pres.
