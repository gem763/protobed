Bad news may be good for cyclicals as they benefit the most from stimulus of last several months. Bond yields bottom when recession fears peak, and we may have passed that point. German DAX is breaking out while the German economy is poor. EMs are also breaking out. We will soon enter favorable seasonality period [Nov 1 \u2013 April 30].\n\nSince the Fed started cutting rates in July 2018, the SP 500 has been flat. The Fed is expected to cut again next week and then pause for a while. The PCE is below 2% target. Globally, there have been 40 rate cuts in the past 3 months; rates peaked 12 months ago; $13.3 trillion in bonds have negative yields [vs $17 trillion in late-August]. The effects of monetary stimulus should be kicking in soon. Lagarde takes over at the ECB on November 1 and she is expected to continue Draghi\u2019s easy monetary policies.\n\nPg 9, Streetwise: Tesla/TSLA CEO Elon Musk\u2019s potentially $56 billion, 10-yr pay package goes to Delaware court soon. The case will focus on conflicts and process, less on the pay amount(s).\n\nPg 12-13: FOMC Statement and Powell\u2019s press conference on Wednesday. BOJ monetary policy on Thursday.\n\nBeware that firms tend to be bullish [after 25-day quiet period] on the IPOs they handle, but some IPOs tumble nonetheless. Be sure to check other sources.\n\nNordstrom [JWN; fwd P/E 11] opened its 7-floor flagship store in Manhattan/NYC. The online sales are now 30% of the revenue and buyers can pickup orders in stores. Off-price division is Nordstrom Rack . In tough retail environment, JWN is doing OK.\n\nData this week: Pending home sales, consumer confidence on Tuesday; advance Q3 GDP growth [+1.8%], ADP employment report on Wednesday; personal income and consumption on Thursday; construction spending, ISM manufacturing index [3rd month below 50?], jobs report [+90,000], unemployment rate [3.6%] on Friday.\n\nBullish Recommendations: None self-standing although the general tone of this issue is bullish.\n\nBearish Recommendations: Fin-tech payment processor Square [SQ; high fwd P/E 60; no GAAP earnings; competition growing for its smartphone card reader; growth has slowed and attempts to grow in traditional markets won\u2019t be easy; pg 15].\n\nPg 13: Tech earnings [TXN, etc] have been hurt by US-China trade war and global slowdown. Corporate spending for tech/IT is down. Semi SOXX and INTC are still showing strength but beware.\n\nPg 14: There have been 6 new yield focused, leveraged CEFs YTD [BSTZ, NMCO, NRGX, RMM, TEAF, FINS] raising $3.6 billion [peak was $14.3 billion in 2013]; all terminate in 12 years; new AIO is pending. The entire CEF market is tiny at $270 billion; ERs are high. The sponsors now pay the IPO fees, so the investors get NAV that is 100% of the price \u2013 unlike the old days when it was 94-95%.\n\nPg 16: Ian Bremmer, Eurasia Group . Many Western post-WWII institutions are declining in influence. Populism is rising in many Western countries. With data, surveillance, social-media tools, technology is helping authoritarian states \u2013 it used to be the opposite. The US is not in decline, but it is gradually withdrawing from the global scene and that has created short-term risks. Impeachment is a cloud, but it is a low probability event [10-15%]. China is rising and is using its economic power in many countries [lending, investing, securing supplies, land/port leases]. Prospect of US-China trade deal is slim; China thinks that the US will soften its stance as the US economy slows and elections approach. ISIS is growing and may create disruptions in Europe. Geopolitical cycles are much larger than business/economic cycles. He has coined the term geopolitical recession \u2013 it is in Turkey, Japan, Singapore, S Korea, Vietnam and many countries in Africa.\n\nPg 18: Big Money Poll.\n\nUS equities over 12 mo: 42% neutral, 31% bearish, 27% bullish\n\nUS valuations: Fairly valued by most\n\nUS GDP growth over 12 mo: 1.5-2.0% by 75%\n\nUS recession: 2020/H2 \u2013 2021 by 58%\n\n10-yr yield in 12 mo: 1.5-2.0% by 71%\n\nNegative Treasury yields in US: Unlikely by 79%\n\nOil by 6/30/20: $57.06\n\nGold by 6/30/20: $1,577\n\nDemocratic nominee: Warren by 64%\n\nPresidential winner: Trump by 62%\n\nHouse Control: Democrats by 80%\n\nSenate Control: Republicans by 80%\n\nCongressional priorities: Entitlement reforms by 25%, cut other federal spending by 20%\n\nUS-China trade deal: Never by 40%, before elections by 40%\n\nTax rates, corporate: Leave unchanged by 79%\n\nTax rates, individual: Leave unchanged by 54%\n\nSocial Security fixes: Raise retirement age by 63%\n\nUS climate change policy: Yes by 61%\n\nTax carried-interest as salary: Yes by 72%\n\nBarron\u2019s Readers Poll: 45% neutral, 29% bullish, 26% bearish\n\nPg 25: Ahead of elections in 2020, there is news on US-China trade, impeachment; possible new regulations on banks, oil drillers; wealth tax, etc. Political risks have grown. There are fewer moderates and there is lack of bipartisanship. Sectors most affected by elections have been IT, consumer-discretionary, healthcare, materials. Ignore political noise and focus on actual policies. Be opportunistic if sectors or stocks overreact to political projections or developments. Ben Phillips of EventShares ETF PLCY offers some names for sports betting [BYD, PENN, TRWH, CHDN], infrastructure [AQUA, GVA, STRL, ASTE, NVEE, ROAD], ethanol production [REX, GPRE, REGI], shipping and IMO 2020 [STNG, SBLK, DSSI, PBF, VLO, HFC].\n\nPg 28: 5G will provide boost to wireless carriers, chip makers, network infrastructure providers, handset makers and benefits will flow to manufacturing, healthcare, automotive industry, etc. Capex needed for 5G will temporarily hurt some earnings. Some question the 5G hype.\n\nPg 29: Charlie Wilson, comanager of EM THDAX [front-load 4.5%], looks for dominant companies with good balance sheets along with some aggressive growth stocks [20%]. Fund uses a barbell approach to growth [35-40%] and value [35-40%]. Currency fluctuations are accounted for in the expected returns. China exposure is 25%. Fund holds 40-60 stocks.\n\nPg 31: European funds saw their first inflows in 16 weeks. There is hope that the European stocks will benefit from European and Chinese stimulus. Risk of near-term no-deal Brexit has been eliminated. Recession may be avoided next year. Cyclicals, financials, renewable energy are attractive. Euro-zone EZU [yield 3.9%, fwd P/E 14, earnings growth 4.6%] has lagged the US SPY [yield 1.9%, fwd P/E 18.3, earnings growth 5%] over 10 years, +3.1% vs +13% annualized. Currency-hedged ETF is HEDJ. Active funds may be better than passive funds.\n\nPg 32: Paternity leaves are becoming more common; 20% of the companies [varies by sectors] now offer these vs 10% in 2010. It is thought that this child rearing burden sharing may help women in the workplace. Noland, Moran, Kotschwar did a comprehensive study involving 21,980 companies in 91 countries but found no relation between generous maternity/paternity leaves and women successes except at the highest levels [corporate boardrooms, etc].\n\nPg 33: Income from value and dividend-payers. Utilities, real-estate, consumer-staples are attractive for dividends. Diversified dividend-oriented ETFs include VYM, SDY, SCHD, DLN, QDF.\n\nPg 34: James Grant, Current Yield. Topic is yield vs growth. For contrast, the yield example is MO [yield 7%; P/E 11.7; debt/EBITDA 2.6]; it owns stakes in Juul , BUD. Growth example is Japanese private-equity and venture-capital firm SoftBank Group [SFTBY, yield 1% (high by Japanese standards)]; it is highly leveraged; selling at 50% discount from NAV; has a stable Japanese telecom business [but selling its stake in S to TMUS] but most of the other investments and positions are in speculative growth companies and startups. He concludes by saying that MO dividend is safe so long as people smoke and drink.\n\nExtras from Friday \u2013 I try to guess on Friday which features will make it in the weekend edition but the following guesses didn\u2019t make it. Almost 75-80% of the weekend edition is now available by 9:00 PM Central on Friday. Barron\u2019s revised website has \u201cInterests\u201d tabs similar to columns topics and that makes it easier to find potential items for the weekend edition. This is also the reason for earlier postings on Saturday \u2013 I do wait for my paper delivery [typically between 5:00-6:30 AM Central] to fill in some data.\n\nNone\n\nYBB", "description": "Pg 5, Up & Down Wall Street: Cyclicals [US and global] are showing good technical strength.
