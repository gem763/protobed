She said she had worked with Instagam alongside \"a host of other experts\" to help formulate the policy.\n\nWeight-loss products have been a focus point for high-profile influencers in the past.\n\nKim Kardashian West was the subject of an intense backlash in May last year after posting promotions for \"appetite suppressant lollipops.\" Jamil sharply criticised the post at the time, calling Kardashian West a \"terrible and toxic influence on young girls.\"\n\nRead more: Influencers are fighting for attention as Instagram tests removing likes from its platform: \"There's no audience applause at the end of a performance\"\n\nWest posted three sponsored posts for the lollipops. Instagram deleted all three, apparently in response to public complaints, but subsequently apologised to Kardashian West for doing so.\n\nkimkardashian/Instagram\n\n\"We want Instagram to be a positive place for everyone that uses it and this policy is part of our ongoing work to reduce the pressure that people can sometimes feel as a result of social media,\" Instagram's UK public policy manager Emma Collins said in a statement.", "description": "The new policy was formulated in conjunction with actress Jameela Jamil, a vocal opponent of the diet and detox industry.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d83465a2e22af1fef57d614-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
