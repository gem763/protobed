spent \u201cmany months\u201d on planning his succession. \u201cThis is not something that happens in a number of weeks,\u201d he insisted. \u201dIt\u2019s really unrelated to Oregon Project or any other issues.\u201d\n\nOn 11 October, Nike released a statement admitting the Salazar situation had become \u201can unfair burden\u201d on athletes on the elite training programme.\n\n\u201cWe made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs,\u201d it read. \u201cWe will help all of our athletes in this transition as they
