Modern technology enables drones to use high-resolution sensors and targeting systems to both find and attack targets at very long ranges, thus compounding the threat. Drones can increasingly operate with less and less human intervention and be programmed to enter enemy airspace, crossing into well-defended areas with decreased risk. Many of them can now fire weapons with little human intervention, due to technical advances in autonomy.\n\nFor instance, should an Army armored convoy be \u201cmoving-to-contact\u201d with an enemy, consisting of heavy, medium and light combat vehicles supported by dismounted infantry - they might be vulnerable to a fast -emerging drone attack from multiple angles. It might even be an extremely sudden attack emerging from an obscured location such as behind a mountain. Many counter-drone systems now under development by the Army and its industry partners such as Raytheon, are engineered to address this kind of circumstance; they are designed to use new applications to destroy, jam or disable attacking drone swarms as well as medium and even large-scale unmanned systems.\n\nNot only are attack drones easily purchasable on the commercial market, but they are rapidly becoming more and more advanced given the lightning speed at which technology is now advancing. Video can be gathered with much higher fidelity at longer ranges, navigational systems can more accurately merge with sensors and targeting technologies and larger numbers of drones can increasingly operate in tandem - in a more coordinated fashion. Battery technology, to cite another example, is progressing so quickly that drones are increasing dwell time over targets, complicating any effort to defend against them.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "The U.S. Army is fast-tracking what could be called an entire sphere of counter-drone weapons", "authors": ["Kris Osborn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DSZlk1f8JgAbqAhUChon8Q--~B/aD05NjM7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/cb1b347f465c3cc024f79dcb276ed81e", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
