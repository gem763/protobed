Canada also housed a G-7 project to share the latest intelligence between allies about possible foreign disinformation and created a non-partisan group to warn political parties and the public about outside interference.\n\n\u201cThe way the Canadians have responded to the problem of technology and democracy is much more impressive than what we\u2019ve seen in Washington,\u201d said Ben Scott, a former Hillary Clinton official, now based in Toronto, who has tracked disinformation campaigns in elections across the West. \u201cPound for pound, Canada is way ahead of the U.S. in terms of policy development on these issues.\u201d\n\nThe country finds itself on the front lines of a global battle to tackle foreign election interference on social media, other platforms for political advertising and hacking of political databases \u2014 and lessons from its upcoming nationwide vote will prove essential for U.S. policymakers already fearful that next year\u2019s presidential campaign will see another round of digital tricks aimed at swaying potential voters and underlying democratic institutions.\n\n\u201cWe saw very clearly that countries like Russia are behind a lot of the divisive campaigns, a lot of the divisive social media that have turned our politics even more divisive and more anger-filled than they have been in the past,\u201d Trudeau told reporters earlier this year.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

While Trudeau was once seen as primed for another term, he is now locked in a tight race with Andrew Scheer, leader of the rival Conservative Party, in an election where ongoing tensions with global autocrats has left Canada, often known as a benign boy scout, ripe for foreign interference.\n\nRussia, for instance, banned Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland because of her support for sanctions and targeted her in an online smear campaign. Saudi Arabia became angry after Freeland promoted human rights in the Middle Eastern country. China also arrested Canadians and blocked imports of Canadian canola and meat following the arrest of senior Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition request.\n\nVery alarmed to learn that Samar Badawi, Raif Badawi\u2019s sister, has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. Canada stands together with the Badawi family in this difficult time, and we continue to strongly call for the release of both Raif and Samar Badawi. \u2014 Chrystia Freeland (@cafreeland) August 2, 2018\n\nBut with many of Canada\u2019s new tactics yet to be tested by real-world attacks, some lawmakers and officials are skeptical the country can successfully fend off online disinformation, cyberattacks and other foreign interference.\n\nSome of Trudeau\u2019s homegrown critics point out that his government has focused on Russian meddling while overlooking how Canadian progressive groups that received U.S. funding promoted his own campaign in 2015. Others question the government\u2019s focus on overseas actors when much of the recent activity has come from domestic groups also trying to sway voters through underhanded tactics.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re in the lead, that\u2019s concerning because we have a long way to go,\u201d said Bob Zimmer, a politician with Canada\u2019s opposition Conservatives, who chairs a parliamentary committee that held several hearings on the threat of disinformation. \u201cI\u2019m not confident. It\u2019s been ramping up every day since the last U.S. election.\u201d\n\n\n\nLessons from 2016\n\nThe Canadian project began soon after Donald Trump was elected president.\n\nIn January 2017, Trudeau appointed Karina Gould to a cabinet position with a new mandate: to work with the intelligence community to protect the election against cyberattacks similar to what hit John Podesta and other Democratic Party officials in the U.S. As anecdotes piled up about foreign troll farms and targeted ads aimed at wooing Canadian citizens, Gould\u2019s mission expanded to include online disinformation.\n\nThe Trudeau Cabinet also was briefed during a government retreat on the Pacific Coast last year by foreign experts \u2014 Scott, who coordinated the Clinton campaign\u2019s tech advisory committee, and Vilmer, head of the French Ministry of Defence research institute IRSEM \u2014 about suspected Russian attacks against Clinton and Emmanuel Macron.\n\n\u201cIt took the annexation of Crimea \u2026 and especially the interference in the American election for everyone to realize that everyone is at risk,\u201d Vilmer said.\n\nDuring discussions with these experts, Canadian officials put together a picture of how foreign interference had grown increasingly sophisticated since the 2016 U.S. election \u2014 and what tactics would be required to keep the upcoming election secure.\n\nIn previous campaigns, foreign actors like those backed by Russia sometimes focused their activities on promoting one side over the other \u2014 most notably in the U.K.\u2019s Brexit referendum in 2016 and in the most recent U.S. presidential election, in which American intelligence agencies said the Kremlin eventually \u201cdeveloped a clear preference\u201d for Donald Trump.\n\nRussia has tweaked its tactics to foment distrust in western democracies\u2019 institutions, portraying NATO-affiliated governments as aggressors aided by dishonest media, according to Canada\u2019s spy agency. These groups also seized on so-called wedge issues from both sides of the political spectrum to stir voter passions.\n\nThe same Russian online troll farm that interfered in the U.S. presidential election occasionally fanned some of Canada\u2019s most incendiary debates, according to data released last year by U.S. lawmakers. A trove of tweets published by Congress showed Russian trolls also posted about Canada\u2019s oil pipelines and Trudeau\u2019s welcoming of refugees.\n\nAnd in the build-up to October\u2019s vote, security experts have warned that far-right U.S. groups are promoting hot-button issues in Canada to push their own political views on both sides of the border.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to stir up trouble in a country that is seen as immigrant-friendly,\u201d said Chloe Colliver, head of the digital research unit at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, a London-based think tank that has tracked potential foreign interference in recent Western elections\n\n\n\nCanada\u2019s game plan\n\nCentral to Canada\u2019s plans is the so-called Critical Election Incident Public Protocol, a series of steps aimed at notifying both political parties and the wider public about foreign interference.\n\nA five-person team of non-partisan bureaucrats \u2014 from Ian Shugart, clerk of the privacy council, to Greta Bossenmaier, national security and intelligence adviser to the prime minister \u2014 oversee the project. It\u2019s tasked with sounding the alarm if serious overseas meddling is detected. That includes possible cyberattacks on political groups or widespread online disinformation campaigns aimed at the public.\n\nThe group receives regular briefings from national security agencies and is expected to sit above the fray of the upcoming political campaign to inform voters about potential overseas threats. In recent months, the officials have been roleplaying possible threats, including cyberattacks, traditional espionage from foreign groups and digital disinformation, such as the use of so-called deepfakes.\n\nSo far, no threat has met the intentionally high threshold for notifying the public, though Ottawa has warned against fake websites mimicking government agencies. Foreign actors also have set up false news outlets online to spread disinformation, according to Buzzfeed.\n\n\u201cIt is not the role of the panel to moderate political discourse,\u201d said a Canadian official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the workings of the group were not public. \u201cIt is a last resort \u2014 not a first resort.\"\n\nCanada also has pushed social media companies to clamp down on political ads.\n\nPlatforms including Facebook have become central to how political messaging circulates in 21st century politics, and despite efforts to force groups to be more upfront about what ads they show on social media, vast numbers of political messages still reach voters with little, if any, oversight.\n\nIn response, the Trudeau government passed a law that took effect in mid-June demanding that Facebook, Google and other online publishers create an independent registry for people buying political ads accessible to all voters. It also requires any buyer of political ads to make transactions through a Canadian bank account used solely for this purpose \u2014 an effort to stop foreign actors from buying political ads ahead of October.\n\nThese efforts go further than what is now required in the U.S., where voluntary transparency registers by social media companies often haven\u2019t provided a clear picture on political advertising. Ahead of next year\u2019s U.S. vote, Facebook updated its rules on which groups could buy political ads, including requiring people to submit their mailing address and other personal information to confirm their identities.\n\nCanada\u2019s government-mandated registry goes further but has gotten off to a rocky start.\n\nGoogle pulled out of accepting political ads before the Canadian campaign, saying the rules were too difficult to comply with. Facebook, still the primary location for political ad spending, said it would participate. Twitter will too once the election kicks off officially, though it hasn\u2019t accepted political advertising since the end of June in preparation for the shift.\n\nGould, the Canadian Cabinet minister, said it was disappointing Google refused to participate, but said it was for the government, not a tech company, to determine which rules should apply during the upcoming campaign.\n\nOver the last three years, she said Ottawa had learned tough lessons from Ukraine and Estonia, both targeted by Russian cyber campaigns, that would prove useful to other democracies, including the U.S., about how to tackle foreign threats.\n\n\u201cBecause our election is three years after what happened in the United States, we\u2019ve had the benefit of talking to experts in like-minded countries,\u201d Gould said. \u201cWhat\u2019s unique is we\u2019ve taken a truly whole of government approach to this.\u201d", "description": "Ahead of the October election, Canada finds itself on the front lines of the war on disinformation and hacking.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6a/ca/a5ccf3d0412b99fd73420d6f3bbf/190307-justin-trudeau-gtty-773.jpg"}
