Bernie Sanders, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, got a warm welcome at a gathering of the United Food and Commercial Workers union at a casino in this Des Moines suburb. The International President of the UFCW, Marc Perrone, praised him as a \u201cliberal lion\u201d who had changed the debate on health care and economic policy. At the end of Sanders\u2019 speech, the roughly 400 union members stood and applauded.\n\nThere was one problem, if you could call it that: Sanders wasn\u2019t in Altoona. While Democratic candidates major (former Vice President Joe Biden) and minor (Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet) had flown to Iowa for the event, Sanders appeared from the living room of his family home in Burlington, Vermont, and delivered his speech via Skype.\n\nAs new polling suggests Sanders\u2019 heart attack may harm his chances to win the nomination, his campaign is working to project normalcy, even as Sanders remains at home under doctor\u2019s orders. Sanders is set to make his first public appearance outside of Vermont since the health scare on Tuesday night at the fourth Democratic presidential debate in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio \u2015 an appearance his campaign hopes will quiet doubts about whether he can win the nomination.\n\nSanders\u2019 speech at the UFCW forum was his standard fare: He promised \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d a $15 minimum wage, doubling union membership in his first term, and floated the possibility of making the work week shorter. (Sanders\u2019 friendly welcome from the UFCW crowd wasn\u2019t a total surprise: The union represents his campaign staff.)\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve proven no matter what may come, you\u2019ll never shrink from a righteous fight,\u201d Perrone said before Sanders spoke. \u201cYou\u2019ve had a cardiac event, and you still wanted to be here with us.\u201d\n\nSanders has made himself available to reporters multiple times in the past week and sat for an interview with ABC News on Sunday, hoping to continue to get his campaign\u2019s message out, even if he\u2019s unable to travel to the early states.\n\nIn a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, 88% of registered voters say they\u2019ve heard at least a little about Sanders having a heart attack. The news appears to have taken a toll on perceptions of his health \u2015 just 19% of voters say they believe he is in good enough physical condition to serve effectively as president for four years. By comparison, 43% believe former Vice President Joe Biden is in adequate health, with 53% saying the same of President Donald Trump and 66% of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nSOPA Images via Getty Images Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will attend Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate in Ohio. He\u2019s been confined to Vermont in recent weeks following a heart attack.\n\nViews of the candidates\u2019 health are clearly, to some extent, motivated by politics: 85% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters consider Trump physically healthy enough to serve, while only a quarter of Democrats and Democratic-leaners say the same.\n\nBut even those on Sanders\u2019 side of the aisle are expressing concerns. Just 28% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Sanders is in physical condition to serve effectively, compared to the 59% who say the same of Biden and the 81% who say the same of Warren.\n\nMore broadly, a 56% majority of voters say they believe Sanders\u2019 age would make it difficult for him to serve effectively as president, with 44% saying the same of Biden, who was born the year after him. Only a third are similarly concerned about Trump\u2019s age. Warren, perhaps helped by the fact that many voters believe her to be younger than she is, fared best on the metric, with just 16% saying her age would make it difficult for her to serve.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether or to what extent these concerns will eat into Sanders\u2019 standing in the horse race, which has remained relatively stable in aggregate for months.\n\nHuffPost US\n\nHuffPost US\n\nHuffPost US\n\nPolling that focuses specifically on the candidates\u2019 age may overstate the degree to which voters are making their decisions on that basis. The electorate may not be pining for a septuagenarian president \u2015 just 3% of Democrats say they\u2019d consider that ideal, per one survey \u2015 but that hasn\u2019t stopped them from advancing a trio of candidates in their 70s to front-runner status against an incumbent of similar age.\n\nThere\u2019s also potential room for specific worries about a candidate\u2019s health to recede. In a 2016 Economist/YouGov poll taken after Hillary Clinton suffered a bout with pneumonia, only 45% of voters thought she was in physical condition to serve as president; within two weeks, however, that number had recovered to 52%, close to where she\u2019d stood earlier in the campaign. (That same poll put confidence in Trump\u2019s physical health in the mid-60s, significantly better than his current standing.)\n\nVoters say, 64% to 22%, that it\u2019s fair for the media to question a candidate\u2019s physical health. They\u2019re more divided on how much information candidates should be expected to provide about their health.\n\nAbout half say candidates should publicly release all medical information that might affect their ability to serve, while 39% say the candidates should have the right to keep their records private. Democratic voters are more than twice as likely as GOP voters to say candidates should release all their medical information \u2015 a reversal from 2016, when Republicans were the party more likely to favor such disclosure and to consider media scrutiny fair game.\n\nScott Olson via Getty Images Sanders spoke to the UFCW gathering via Skype.\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign maintains that he will demonstrate his vitality on national television when he participates in Tuesday\u2019s presidential debate in Westerville, Ohio. It is his first public appearance since the Oct. 1 hospitalization.\n\nOn the debate stage, said campaign spokesman Mike Casca, voters will see a \u201creinvigorated Bernie.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will dispel any lingering concerns when he returns to his regular pace on the trail,\u201d Casca added.\n\nSanders announced over the weekend that his first major campaign event since the heart attack will be a large \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally on the East River waterfront in Queens, New York, on Saturday.\n\nThe rally, held in the same city where Warren drew her largest crowd of the campaign, follows a rocky period for Sanders\u2019 as it has sought to quiet doubts about viability.\n\nSanders, who has been recovering at his home in Burlington, Vermont, told a group of reporters staking out his home on Tuesday that he would likely be slowing the pace of his campaign by, among other things, holding fewer than three or four events a day. A day later, he said he had \u201cmisspoke\u201d and that he had no plans to decelerate the campaign.\n\nBut the campaign has said that Sanders\u2019 error was tonal \u2015 implying that the campaign would be less intense \u2015 rather than substantively inaccurate. It has not taken back the part of his remarks where he said he would hold fewer daily events going forward. In response to a request for clarification from HuffPost, the campaign declined to detail the volume of Sanders\u2019 future events, but said that Sanders would be careful not to overextend himself.\n\nIndeed, Sanders and his aides often imply that adopting a lighter schedule would not affect the campaign\u2019s performance, since he previously had one of the most packed schedules of any of the Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s run a more vigorous campaign than Sen. Sanders \u2015 often holding three or four rallies a day with town halls throughout \u2015 and he was doing it all with a partially blocked artery,\u201d Casca said.\n\nSanders vowed in mid-September that he would release his full medical records well before the Iowa caucus on Feb. 3. He has reiterated that commitment in the wake of his heart attack. In a Sunday interview with ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl, he said merely that the campaign would be releasing them \u201cas soon as we can.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Sanders has been putting out a steady stream of digital content from his Burlington home designed to showcase his health. On Friday, Sanders released a video on social media showing him hitting baseballs pitched by deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. The clip quickly racked up more than 500,000 views on Twitter.\n\nAnd when Karl interviewed him on Sunday, he pitched to Sanders in the Vermont senator\u2019s backyard. Karl subsequently took a shot at Sanders\u2019 pitches.\n\n\u201cTrue \u2015 I got shelled by a 78-year-old guy who just had a heart attack,\u201d Karl wrote in an Instagram post capturing video of Sanders making contact on Karl\u2019s pitch. \u201cBut check out Sanders on the mound.\u201d\n\nThe HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Oct. 8-10 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov\u2019s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.\n\nHuffPost has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

YouGov\u2019s reports include a model-based margin of error, which rests on a specific set of statistical assumptions about the selected sample rather than the standard methodology for random probability sampling.
