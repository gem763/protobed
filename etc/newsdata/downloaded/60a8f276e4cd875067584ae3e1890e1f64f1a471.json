The legislature was not sitting at the time.\n\nElsewhere, masked and stick-wielding protesters hurled stones and battled with security forces, who responded with tear gas.\n\nThe South American country of 17 million appeared to be at a dangerous impasse, paralyzed by a lack of public transport and blockaded roads that were taking a toll on an already vulnerable economy.\n\nEcuador moves government out of capital as violent protests rage Read more\n\nViolence has persisted since last week when Len\u00edn Moreno\u2019s decision to cut subsidies led to a sharp increase in fuel prices. Several oil wells ceased production totaling 65,000 barrels daily because protesters seized installations, the energy ministry said.\n\nOn Monday, police abandoned an armored vehicle to protesters who set it on fire. Elsewhere, rioters smashed car windows, broke into shops and confronted security forces who fired tear gas to try to disperse swelling crowds.\n\nSome video footage has shown police beating protesters on the ground. Opponents have accused the Ecuador president\u2019s government of human rights abuses in its attempts to quell disturbances.\n\nMoreno met with cabinet ministers in Guayaquil on Tuesday after moving government operations there from Quito because of security problems. In comments broadcast by the Ecuavisa television network, he said he had the support of Ecuador\u2019s institutions and thanked them \u201cfor their defense of the democratic system\u201d.\n\nIn a televised addressed late Monday, he said he had been the target of a coup attempt, but would not back down from his decision to cut the subsidies. The cuts were among measures announced as part of a $4.2bn funding plan with the International Monetary Fund, which said the package will strengthen Ecuador\u2019s economy and generate jobs.\n\nSeveral military commanders in uniform stood behind Moreno during his address, underscoring the armed forces\u2019 support.\n\nMoreno called for dialogue to resolve the crisis, but he also claimed that his leftist predecessor \u2013 and former political patron \u2013 Rafael Correa, is trying to destabilize Ecuador with the help of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s president. Ecuador is among dozens of nations calling for Maduro to leave office.\n\nCorrea and Moreno have traded allegations of corruption in recent months, and Correa says he and his allies are victims of political persecution.\n\nSome 570 people have been arrested for crimes including attacks on people as well as public and private property, according to Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Rold\u00e1n, the president\u2019s private secretary.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re going through is not a peaceful mobilization, it\u2019s delinquency and vandalism,\u201d Rold\u00e1n said on Twitter.\n\nThe government last week declared a state of emergency, allowing it to curb some civil liberties as it tries to restore order.\n\nThe disturbances have spread from transport workers to students to indigenous demonstrators, an ominous turn for the government. Indigenous protesters played a major role in the 2005 resignation of Ecuador\u2019s president at the time, Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez, though the military\u2019s tacit approval was key to his removal.\n\nThe country\u2019s biggest indigenous group, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador \u2013 which also had mounted protests against Correa \u2013 said Moreno\u2019s government had failed to address protesters\u2019 concerns and the welfare of Ecuador\u2019s \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d people.\n\n\u201cTroops and police who approach indigenous territories will be detained and subjected to indigenous justice,\u201d the group said in a statement.", "description": "Masked and stick-wielding protesters hurled stones and battled with security forces, who responded with tear gas", "authors": ["Associated Press In Quito"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91e5bcd4762e3b3cb53aca2291270246bfcfd342/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9a1dde7075ede39efccd502a2eb13edc", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
