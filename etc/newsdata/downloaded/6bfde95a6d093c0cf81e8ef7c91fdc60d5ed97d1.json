He said al-Baghdadi was known to move often and was soon expected to change locations.\n\nHOW ISIS LEADER AL-BAGHDADI'S HEADLESS BODY WAS ID'D MINUTES AFTER DEATH\n\nBefore al-Baghdadi could move, a Kurdish undercover operative was able to reach him and retrieve the self-styled \u201cCaliph\u2019s\u201d underwear, Can said. Through a DNA test, he said they were able to confirm \u201c100%\u201d that the person of interest was al-Baghdadi.\n\n\u201cAll intelligence and access to Al Baghdadi as well as the identification of his place, were the result of our own work,\u201d Can wrote. \u201cOur intelligence source was involved in sending coordinates, directing the airdrop, participating in and making the operation a success until the last minute.\u201d\n\nAL-BAGHDADI INFORMANT WAS INSIDE COMPOUND AT TIME OF RAID, KURDISH GENERAL TELLS FOX NEWS\n\nIn announcing al-Baghdadi\u2019s death, President Trump had said the Kurds provided \u201chelpful\u201d information but didn\u2019t provide \u201ca military role at all.\u201d\n\nWhile U.S. officials have not confirmed Can\u2019s account, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, the SDF commander, had told Fox News on Monday that the Kurdish force had an informant inside the compound at the time of the raid. The agent had told them about the tunnels under the compound, how many people were with al-Baghdadi and about his planned move.\n\nAl-Baghdadi was killed after he fled down a dead-end tunnel with three children \u2013 where he was found \"whimpering\" and trapped \u2013 and detonated a suicide vest.\n\nWHO'S LEADING ISIS NOW THAT AL-BAGHDADI IS DEAD?\n\nAl-Baghdadi\u2019s head remained intact following the blast, allowing commandos to use biometrics, specifically facial recognition, to immediately identify him. Trump said they had also brought along samples of al-Baghdadi\u2019s DNA to verify his identity with an onsite test that produced positive results in only 15 minutes.\n\nIt was unclear what kind of devices were used to positively identify al-Baghdadi, but over the past several years the military has been developing technology for portable DNA labs that process results quickly.\n\nThe technicians were able to take \u201csubstantial pieces\u201d of al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains from the site, Trump said.\n\nAL-BAGHDADI KILL: HOW THE DARING MILITARY OPERATION WENT DOWN\n\nOn Monday, Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that al-Baghdadi\u2019s remains were \u201cdisposed of appropriately\u201d in accordance with the law of armed conflict, but didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nA source has told Fox News he was buried at sea, similar to Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden, who was killed in 2011.\n\nWhile it remains unclear who exactly will take over the terror organization, Trump confirmed on Tuesday that al-Baghdadi's \"number one replacement\" was killed by American troops, without naming the target.\n\nA senior State Department official had confirmed to Fox News on Monday the death of ISIS spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, who was considered al-Baghdadi's right-hand man.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe void in leadership is the latest significant setback for the terror group after having already lost vast stretches of its physical caliphate that stretched across parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nFox News' Benjamin Hall and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.", "description": "Before the U.S. military\u00a0positively identified the headless body of the world\u2019s most wanted terrorist\u00a0killed in a daring raid, a Kurdish spy had slipped into Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\u2019s compound and stole a pair of underwear to confirm\u00a0the man\u2019s identity as the long-sought ISIS leader through a DNA test, a Kurdish official said.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/Abu-Bakr-al-Baghdadi-NEW.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
