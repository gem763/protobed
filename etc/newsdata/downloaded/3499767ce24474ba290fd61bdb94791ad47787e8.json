You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\"Atlanta. One of my favourite places in the world, to be in, and play shows. But I do not love the state's lawmaker's decision to take away women's rights,\" Eilish wrote. \"I can't believe we are even having this conversation in 2019.\"\n\nThe 17-year-old added: \"I'm dedicating my performance and donating a portion of my guarantee tomorrow to @plannedparenthood. We need this organisation more than ever.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood replied with a tweet, saying: \"Thank you, @billieeilish for donating your proceeds from @musicmidtown to Planned Parenthood Southeast! #IStandWithPP.\"\n\nEilish also shared a link to the \"I Stand With Planned Parenthood\" campaign, an initiative which involves musicians \"standing up against the abortion bans sweeping the country\".\n\nIn May, Georgia governor Brian Kemp signed the state's controversial \"heartbeat\" abortion ban into law. It could lead to women could be sent to prison for life if they have a termination after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe law will not come into effect until January. It does include exemptions for cases involving rape, incest or if the mother's health is in danger.\n\nHowever, in cases involving rape or incest, women will only be allowed an abortion if they are less than 20 weeks pregnant and if they have filed a police report.\n\nCalifornia-born Eilish has publicly condemned the newly-introduced US abortion bans in the past.\n\nIn May, the musician told Variety magazine that the abortion bills made her \"red\" with anger, and women \"should say, should do and feel and be exactly what they want\".\n\nShe added: \u201cThere should be nobody else telling them how to live their life, how to do s***. It just makes me so mad that if I start talking about it, I won\u2019t stop. Men should not make women\u2019s choices - that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d", "description": "Pop star\u00a0Billie Eilish has said she will\u00a0donate\u00a0a portion of the fee she receives for performing at an\u00a0Atlanta\u00a0music festival to Planned Parenthood\u00a0-\u00a0non-profit reproductive healthcare organisation Eilish is due to perform at the Music Midtown festival in the Georgian city this weekend.", "authors": ["Sabrina Barr"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/14/16/billie-eilish.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
