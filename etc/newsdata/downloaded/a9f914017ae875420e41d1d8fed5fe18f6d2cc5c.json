Walter is getting melancholically loaded in the shag-carpeted basement of their home, \u201csitting on a stool with a bottle of vodka in his hand, tears rolling down his face.\u201d He has something to impart to the preteen Flea. \u201cHe gently took my arm and said, \u2018I love you, man, I love you so much. You are what\u2019s beautiful, your light is always gonna shine over the evil and meanness in this world. You\u2019re special, man, you have the gift. Dig it, man, dig it.\u2019 He said it slowly and kindly through his boozy tears.\u201d\n\nBorn Michael Peter Balzary in Australia in 1962, Flea was propelled by the wreck of his parents\u2019 marriage first to New York and then to L.A. Acid for the Children is, presumably, volume one of his memoirs: It takes you as far as 1983, and the first Red Hot Chili Peppers show at a bar called the Grandia Room. \u201cAll that self-destruction,\u201d writes Flea, \u201call that hopeful love whirling in and around us, something had to give. Death or Life \u2026 It was out of our reach, out of any construct. I felt my body being hurled around by the rhythm \u2026 I was a conduit, and did not exist as a means to an end.\u201d By this point in the story, having accompanied Flea through many close shaves, strange baptisms, and musical rendings of the veil (\u201cI felt the Hendrix deep inside my little heart\u201d), the reader is completely down with his apocalyptic inner worldview.\n\nAcid for the Children is not an as-told-to, nor is it written \u201cwith\u201d someone. These are Flea\u2019s words\u2014excitable, jazzy, regretful, disarming, popping and writhing away in his biological bass zone. Insecurities to the fore: He worries that he may be producing \u201ca thorny jumble of trash.\u201d But he\u2019s actually a lovely writer, with a particular gift for the free-floating and reverberant. He writes in Beat Generation bursts and epiphanies, lifting toward the kind of virtuosic vulnerability and self-exposure associated with the great jazz players.\n\nOne unforgettable scene finds the young Flea, having fled the house due to the erratic behavior of Walter, riding the bus home after a long day of karate. Three bandanna\u2019d young men climb on, \u201cstraight gangbangers,\u201d giving off a pronounced vibe of chemical disruption. Or as Flea puts it, \u201chigh as fuck.\u201d They are potent, stylish, compelling. One of them, in an eerie falsetto, is singing a melody from Parliament\u2019s absurdist rump-shaker \u201cNight of the Thumpasorus Peoples.\u201d \u201cHe had a beautifully haunting voice,\u201d writes Flea, \u201cand sang the nonsensical syllables slowly and drawn out, the ghostly high-pitched notes echoing around the empty night bus as it headed up towards Hollywood \u2026 Not only did the sound make them appear like they operated in an otherworldly dimension, music took on a meaning that I had not before considered.\u201d So for the domestically disturbed and karate\u2019d-out little Flea, the portal opens, and the bus becomes a vessel of mystery. Of poetry, really. You don\u2019t get this kind of thing, needless to say, in your standard rock memoir.", "description": "In his new memoir, Acid for the Children, the Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist exhibits virtuosic vulnerability.", "authors": ["James Parker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/Flea_Author_Photo_photo_credit_Peter_Staley/facebook.jpg?1572448231", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
