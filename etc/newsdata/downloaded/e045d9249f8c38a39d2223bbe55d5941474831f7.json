Mike Enzi (Wyo.), right, and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) are potential targets for Democrats looking for Republican votes in the Senate to remove President Trump. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nHouse Democrats building their impeachment case against President Trump need to think like smart prosecutors who aren\u2019t just trying to win a grand-jury indictment but also want to succeed in a jury trial.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has a clear majority in the House supporting her move to turn the investigation into a formal impeachment inquiry. With just the facts already known about Trump\u2019s effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate his domestic political rival, the president believes the House has a simple majority to essentially indict him with articles of impeachment.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, House committee chairmen might be able to begin building a case designed to actually turn some Senate Republicans against Trump. So far most attention, from Democrats and the media, has focused on a handful or so of Senate Republicans up for reelection next year in states where Democrats have either recently won or competed in presidential campaigns.\n\nThat\u2019s a mistake.\n\nInstead of the already vulnerable Republicans, Democrats should focus on a clutch of roughly 10 incumbents with several similar character traits: senior statesmen within their caucus who have either announced their plans to retire or have signaled they are likely to not run for reelection. These GOP senators are at the point in their careers where history\u2019s judgment might mean more to them than the views of today\u2019s conservative activists.\n\nSome Democrats have taken note of this group, including Republicans such as Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Richard Burr (N.C.) and Johnny Isakson (Ga.), because their remarks so far on Trump and Ukraine have been very brief or just nonexistent.\n\n\u201cI am not optimistic so far, but there is lots of silence,\u201d Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), who maintains good relations with many GOP senators, said Wednesday. \u201cIt has been unusually quiet. I think most of them are holding their breath.\u201d\n\nAlexander, for instance, issued a statement that took no side in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to compel Ukrainian investigations into former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and his son Hunter, simply acknowledging the fact that investigations are happening.\n\n\u201cThe Senate Intelligence Committee is determining the facts in the Ukraine whistleblower matter, and I want to know the facts before I comment,\u201d Alexander said in a prepared statement.\n\nAs The Washington Post has tracked their views, 14 GOP senators have expressed concerns or questioned Trump\u2019s judgment. That list includes just four of the 19 Senate Republicans running for reelection next year.\n\n[The revealing splits in GOP senators\u2019 reactions to impeachment]\n\nAlexander, 79, announced in December that he would not seek a fourth Senate term. Isakson, 74, who is battling Parkinson\u2019s disease, announced his resignation effective at the end of this year. Burr, 63, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is up for reelection in 2022 but has said he is not likely to run for a fourth term.\n\nSens. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), the respective chairmen of the Budget and Agriculture committees, were elected together in 1996 and are not running for reelection.\n\nA spokesman for Enzi offered up a completely neutral statement the day Pelosi formally kicked off the impeachment inquiry. \u201cHe will be a jurist, listen to the evidence, and once all the evidence is in, he will make a final decision,\u201d the aide said.\n\nIf a rebellion happens among GOP senators, it\u2019s most likely to start with a group of these veterans who do not have any short-term political pain to suffer.\n\nWhile the House needs just a simple majority to impeach Trump, a conviction and removal is far more difficult, requiring a two-thirds vote in the Senate. So at least 20 Republicans would need to join all 47 members of the Democratic caucus, and any hope for House Democrats is to begin getting a bloc of these Senate GOP veterans on board.\n\nSome traditional conservatives, those who still hold nostalgia for the Reagan years of fighting the \u201cEvil Empire\u201d in Moscow, pine for Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) to lead the charge against Trump. They believe his popularity at home could withstand the backlash, and that his past defeats in presidential bids mean he has given up that ambition.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how the Senate works. Romney, 72, is a newcomer there, having just won his seat last year. Few Senate Republicans really know the former Massachusetts governor, with just a few months of trust.\n\nInstead, the onetime corporate consultant at Bain Capital knows there is safety in numbers, and Romney would only jump into a full civil war against Trump if he had other GOP senators at his side.\n\n[\u2018Out on a limb\u2019: Inside the Republican reckoning over Trump\u2019s possible impeachment]\n\nWho is least likely to lead a rebellion? Those GOP senators running for reelection next year.\n\nThey are in a form of political paralysis that will most likely lead to vague statements sounding critical of Trump, but not quite backing the House\u2019s impeachment or removal from office with a Senate vote.\n\n\u201cHold up: Americans don\u2019t look to Chinese commies for the truth. If the Biden kid broke laws by selling his name to Beijing, that\u2019s a matter for American courts, not communist tyrants running torture camps,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement.\n\nSasse is all but certain to win reelection in November in his conservative state, but only if he wins the GOP primary next May. The filing deadline for those challenging him is March 1.\n\nFiling deadlines for challengers to GOP incumbents in Colorado, Maine, Arizona and Iowa fall in mid-March and early April. Those primary contests will come in June or later next summer, well after an impeachment trial is likely to conclude.\n\nUnless Trump\u2019s standing falls with GOP voters \u2014 the latest Gallup Poll average had 87 percent approving of his job performance \u2014 these Republican incumbents would not reasonably expect to vote to remove the president from office and win their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nJust look at North Carolina. Sen. Thom Tillis (R) opposed Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency to unilaterally shift money from military projects to fund border fencing. Despite reversing his position, Tillis still drew a primary opponent, and Tillis has tacked to the right with a full embrace of the president.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), up for reelection next year, epitomizes that situation. McConnell faced an expensive primary in 2014, then went on to easily win a sixth term in a state that has grown increasingly conservative.\n\nNow, with Trump fully behind his reelection, McConnell is coasting in the GOP primary, posting digital ads that make clear he has no intention of breaking with Trump.\n\n\u201cThey finally convinced her to impeach the president,\u201d he says of Pelosi in one ad. \u201cAll of you know your Constitution. The way that impeachment stops is a Senate majority with me as majority leader.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "The incumbents up for reelection next year in Democratic or swing states are in a form of political paralysis ahead of primary deadlines.
