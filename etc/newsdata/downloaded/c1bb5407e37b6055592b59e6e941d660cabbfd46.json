Then you can go and lie down to get some rest for the night... in a custom made coffin bed.\n\nOh, and we're also loving the extra touches such as the free skeleton pyjamas and slippers for guests!\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nFor those who can't get to sleep, the Black Jester will be on hand to come and share one of his favourite bedtime stories - and provide a much needed dram of whiskey before midnight.\n\nFrom then on, you're on your own...\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe S\u00e9ance Sleepover is available for up to two guests, and will only be running on Halloween (the 31st October).\n\nIt can be booked exclusively on Booking.com on the listing here from 10am on Friday 25th October so you'll want to get in quick to bag the stay.\n\nThe offer also includes a complimentary breakfast at the nearby Motel One Hotel the next morning.\n\nNever been to Edinburgh before?
