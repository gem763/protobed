I don't want to f*** her up!'\n\nHe asked his guest on the satellite show, Dr. Donna Dannenfelser, on how to proceed, and she said he could correct Monroe and reinforce that her nanny's name is Cecilia or he could ignore it and see what happens.\n\nSplitsville: Lewis and ex Gage Edward, 34, broke up earlier this year after more than a decade together.
