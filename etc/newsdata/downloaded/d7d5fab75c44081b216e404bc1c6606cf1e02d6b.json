It's a full-time job just being Rihanna, and while fans are clamoring for new music, she's clearly busy doing things like running Fenty Beauty and being the wealthiest woman musician in the world. She's not really in a rush to put out another full-length. That's OK!\n\nBut for The Navy\u2014Rihanna's most diehard fans\u2014the fact that there is no upcoming album confirmed or even a single to speak of is an incredible affront. As a recent Vogue interview with the \"Work\" singer notes, her biggest supporters have grown impatient with the lack of new tunes. They'll often comment rude things on her Fenty social media posts like \"Ok now can you please go back to singing,\" which will sometimes elicit snarky responses from Rihanna herself. She tells Vogue, \"I know I have some very unhappy fans who don\u2019t understand the inside bits of how [making an album] works.\u201d The Navy's love for the singer is obvious, but like any hyper-online and mobilized community, the way they show their affection can get a little intense.\n\nJust take this interaction in the interview between Rihanna and writer Abby Aguirre:\n\nWhen I ask about a release date, Rihanna\u2019s face morphs into a grimace, equal parts amusement and terror. \u201cNo, oh my God, they\u2019re gonna kill you for that!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to kill me more!\u201d It is so strange to see @badgalriri exhibit any sort of emotion categorizable as fear that for a moment I have no clue who she\u2019s talking about. Wait\u2014Vogue? Your record company? The international reggae police? \u201cI\u2019m talking the Navy\u2014my scary fans,\u201d Rihanna clarifies. \u201cBut they\u2019ve earned it,\u201d she is quick to add. \u201cThey got me here.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly what someone stuck in a hostage situation would say. There's the initial shock from Rihanna in stating, \"Oh my God, they\u2019re gonna kill you for that!\" and then the fear leading her to add the \"But they've earned it\" qualifier. And fandoms can engage in some pretty disturbing and threatening behavior online. Just look at how Nicki Minaj's Barbz sent death threats to a journalist, or how a Postmates delivery driver feared for her life after Lizzo tweeted her dissatisfaction about her order with a screenshot of the woman's face.\n\nRihanna has every right to be a little nervous. Hopefully she stays busy, but also finds time to appease the Navy and everyone else begging for new music in the meantime.
