Maybe we have been looking at this for too long and we got too focused on it that we forgot to win some of the little battles along the way.\"\n\n- Best's emotional exit -\n\nIreland's fans reserved their biggest cheer of the evening for Best's farewell media interview despite their captain leading his team to their worst-ever World Cup result.\n\nThe softly-spoken Ulsterman was visibly moved as he left the pitch for the last time and was fighting back tears as he thanked the fans for their support.\n\nAsked later how he felt, he replied simply: \"Right now, tired, sore, upset.\"\n\n\"I'm unbelievably upset with the thought that I'll never put on a green jersey again except to go and support,\" said the hooker, again blinking back tears, before leaving to a rare round of applause from reporters.\n\n- Brilliant Barrett boys -\n\nIt was the first match the Barrett brothers - Beauden, Scott and Jordie - had played since the death of their grandfather, and they wore black armbands to show their respect.\n\nAll three put in performances to make their family proud.\n\nFullback Beauden was man of the match, his 21 carries the most on the pitch and his distribution central to the All Blacks' attacking brilliance.\n\nHe capped the show with a well-taken try, demonstrating pace and silky footballing skills to control a bouncing ball and collect for his score.\n\nScott came on at half-time for Sam Cane and continued the New Zealand back row's torment of Sexton, before Jordie had the final say, a pinpoint pass picking him out for a score in the corner - from who else but brother Beauden.\n\n- Experience isn't everything -\n\nOne of the talking points before the game was how the experienced Ireland back three of Rob Kearney, Keith Earls and Jacob Stockdale would fare against opposite numbers who had fewer than half the caps combined.\n\nBut while Barrett, wings Sevu Reece and George Bridge were irresistible, the Irish squandered several chances to score with mistimed passes and were not clinical enough when they did get chances in the New Zealand 22.\n\n\"Our attack has gone to a new level,\" said coach Steve Hansen after the game, while Schmidt bemoaned his team's inability to convert their opportunities.", "description": "New Zealand dismantled an error-strewn Ireland to progress to a mouth-watering semi-final against England, as the Irish were again found wanting at the quarter-final stage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2768/9c7f6c5cc208465c8db407f757c090ae.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
