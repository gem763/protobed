Alabama joins Nebraska (348, Oct. 12, 1981-Sept. 22, 2002), Florida State (211, Sept. 24, 1989-Nov. 11, 2001) and Florida (209, Sept. 9, 1990-Oct. 5, 2002) with poll streaks of at least 200 appearances.\n\nUP\n\nThe middle of the rankings got a big makeover after five teams ranked from Nos. 10-19 lost.

The Golden Bears have their best ranking since they were No. 6 on Sept. 27, 2009.\n\nNo. 14 Iowa, No. 16 Boise State, No. 17 Washington and No. 18 Virginia all moved up at least three spots.\n\nDOWN\n\nSeveral ranked losers managed to stay in the rankings.\n\n- No. 19 Utah fell nine spots after losing at USC.\n\n- No. 20 Michigan dropped nine spots.\n\n- No. 22 UCF fell seven places after losing to Pitt, the Knights' first regular-season loss in almost three years.\n\nStory continues\n\n- No. 24 Texas A&M slipped six spots but stayed ranked with a 2-2 record. The Aggies have losses to Clemson and Auburn.\n\nOUT\n\nOne-and-done teams are common early in the season. Arizona State and TCU both had short stays after debuting in the rankings last week. The Sun Devils and Horned Frogs fell out after losing home games.\n\nWashington State dropped out of the rankings for the first time this season after blowing a 32-point lead at home to previously winless UCLA.\n\nIN\n\nThree teams moved into the rankings but only one for the first time this season.\n\n- No. 21 USC has been in, out and back in the last three weeks.\n\n- No. 24 Kansas State, which did not play this weekend, is ranked for the first time since Sept. 10, 2017.\n\n- No. 25 Michigan State jumped back in after a week out.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nSEC - 6 (Nos. 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 23)\n\nBig Ten - 6 (Nos. 5, 8, 12, 14, 20, 25)\n\nPac 12 - 5 (Nos. 13, 15, 17, 19, 21)\n\nBig 12 - 3 (Nos. 6, 11, 24)\n\nACC - 2 (Nos. 1, 18)\n\nAmerican - 1 (No. 22)\n\nMountain West - 1 (No. 16)\n\nIndependent - 1 (No. 10)\n\nRANKED vs. RANKED\n\nNo. 18 Virginia at No. 10 Notre Dame.
