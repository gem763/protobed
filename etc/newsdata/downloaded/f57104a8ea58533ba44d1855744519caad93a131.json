It is so flexible that it allows users to put their arms overhead, something astronauts during the Apollo programme were not able to do.\n\n\u2018Zippers are bad and cables are bad so we have no zippers or cables on this suit,\u2019 she explained at a demonstration held in Washington DC. \u2018There will be fewer seams and new materials that keep the dust out.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also features new technology to better manage pressure and the gloves have been improved to allow greater dexterity.\n\nThe two Nasa spacesuit prototypes for lunar exploration, one for launch and re-entry aboard spacecraft and one for exploring the surface of the Moon\u2019s South Pole (AP)\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll remember, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, they bunny hopped on the surface of the moon, well now we\u2019re actually going to be able to walk on the surface of the moon, which is very different than our suits of the past,\u2019 said Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine.\n\nNasa administrator Jim Bridenstine holds a rock handed to him by Kristine Dans during a demonstration of the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU) spacesuit (AP)\n\nThe Orion suit used for launch and entry is made from fire resistant material and features a lighter and stronger helmet, with improvements to reduce noise. Nasa is aiming to put the the first woman and next man on the moon by 2024 and maintain a presence with an ISS-like gateway orbiting around it, in hopes of eventually moving further into space to Mars.\n\nKenneth Bowersox, acting associate administrator for human exploration, recently cast some doubt on the target date for the Artemis missions to the moon, saying he would not bet anything on it.\n\nKristine Dans bends down to pick up the rock during a demonstration of the mobility of the suit (AP)\n\nFunding and technical challenges still need to come together in order to meet the White House-set deadline, the former space shuttle and space station commander told a congressional subcommittee last month.", "description": "No more 'bunny hops'", "authors": ["Jeff Parsons"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_90132416_1571303252.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
