Today, we\u2019re sharing some next steps: https://t.co/chWzGf6Amv pic.twitter.com/Ye3xjjRdrh \u2014 Walmart Inc. (@WalmartInc) September 3, 2019 Report\n\nCelebrities and politicians, including several Democrats campaigning for president, praised the firm's decision.\n\nBut America's gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, called the changes \"shameful\" and said the firm would lose business.\n\nAnother major US retailer joined Walmart on Tuesday. Kroger changed its policy by \"respectfully asking\" customers to stop openly carrying guns in stores where state laws allow it.\n\nJessica Adelman, group vice-president of corporate affairs, said in a statement that only authorised law enforcement officers should be carrying weapons in Kroger outlets.\n\nBusiness impact?\n\nWalmart's chief executive, who also called on the US Congress to pass stricter gun laws, said he expected the changes to reduce the firm's share of the ammunition market from about 20% to a range of 6% to 9%.\n\nThe company will continue to sell hunting rifles and shotguns, and much of the ammunition for those weapons, he added.\n\nWalmart stock was little changed after the announcement. Shares in some gun-makers, such as Vista Outdoors, slumped.\n\nGuns and ammunition represent a tiny fraction of overall Walmart sales, said Burt Flickinger III, a managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group.\n\nHe predicted the decision would pay off, allowing the retailer to provide more store space to faster growing categories such as nappies for babies.\n\n\"Walmart will be significantly ahead in sales growth and significantly ahead in profitable sales and market share growth by concentrating on children and health categories, rather than the declining guns and ammo categories,\" he said.\n\nWalmart's competitive prices will be likely to help it retain customers, no matter what their politics, he added.\n\nMass shootings in the US\n\nWalmart's decision follows two incidents at stores in August, in which a gunman killed 22 people in El Paso, Texas, and a former employee killed two workers at a Walmart store in Mississippi.\n\nLast month, other mass shootings - defined since 2012 as incidents as those that kill at least three people - in Ohio and Texas left more than a dozen dead.\n\nThere have been more than 110 mass shootings in the US since 1982, according to investigative magazine Mother Jones.\n\nHowever, Walmart has lagged behind other US retailers in changes to its gun policies.\n\nKroger-owned Fred Meyer stopped selling guns in 2018 after a mass shooting at a school in Parkland, Florida. That same year, Dick's Sporting Goods ended the sale of assault weapons and raised the minimum age to 21 for gun purchases.\n\nMr Flickinger said the move reflected a shift since Walmart stopped being a family-run company. Sam Walton, who founded the company in 1962, was a known hunting enthusiast.\n\n\"It shows a very constructive change from a family-managed and run business,\" Mr Flickinger said.", "description": "The retailer will stop sales of certain types of ammunition in response to recent attacks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/165BD/production/_108218519_gettyimages-963724748.jpg"}
