End the lies. \u2013 TechCrunch", "language": "en", "text": "Permitting falsehood in political advertising would work if we had a model democracy, but we don\u2019t. Not only are candidates dishonest, but voters aren\u2019t educated, and the media isn\u2019t objective. And now, hyperlinks turn lies into donations and donations into louder lies. The checks don\u2019t balance. What we face is a self-reinforcing disinformation dystopia.\n\nThat\u2019s why if Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube don\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth in campaign ads, they should stop selling them. If they can\u2019t be distributed safely, they shouldn\u2019t be distributed at all.\n\nNo one wants historically untrustworthy social networks becoming the honesty police, deciding what\u2019s factual enough to fly. But the alternative of allowing deception to run rampant is unacceptable. Until voter-elected officials can implement reasonable policies to preserve truth in campaign ads, the tech giants should go a step further and refuse to run them.\n\nThis problem came to a head recently when Facebook formalized its policy of allowing politicians to lie in ads and refusing to send their claims to third-party fact-checkers. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe, however, that it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny\u201d Facebook\u2019s VP of policy Nick Clegg wrote.\n\nThe Trump campaign was already running ads with false claims about Democrats trying to repeal the Second Amendment and weeks-long scams about a \u201cmidnight deadline\u201d for a contest to win the one-millionth MAGA hat.\n\nAfter the announcement, Trump\u2019s campaign began running ads smearing potential opponent Joe Biden with widely debunked claims about his relationship with Ukraine. Facebook, YouTube and Twitter refused to remove the ad when asked by Biden.\n\nIn response to the policy, Elizabeth Warren is running ads claiming Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg endorses Trump because it\u2019s allowing his campaign lies. She\u2019s continued to press Facebook on the issue, asking \u201cyou can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards.\u201d\n\nWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook.

Once all sides are complicit in the misinformation, lying loses its stigma, becomes the status quo, and ceases to have consequences. Otherwise, whichever campaign misleads more aggressively will have an edge.\n\n\u201cIn open democracies, voters rightly believe that, as a general rule, they should be able to judge what politicians say themselves.\u201d Facebook\u2019s Clegg writes.\n\nBut as is emblematic of Facebook\u2019s past mistakes, it\u2019s putting too much idealistic faith in society. If all voters were well educated and we weren\u2019t surrounded by hyperpartisan media from Fox News to far-left Facebook Pages, maybe this hands-off approach might work. But in reality, juicy lies spread further than boring truths, and plenty of \u201cnews\u201d outlets are financially incentivized to share sensationalism and whatever keeps their team in power.\n\nProtecting the electorate should fall to legislators. But incumbents have few reasons to change the rules that got them their jobs. The FCC already has truth in advertising policies, but exempts campaign ads and a judge struck down a law mandating accuracy.\n\nGranted, there have always been dishonest candidates, uninformed voters, and one-sided news outlets. But it\u2019s all gotten worse. We\u2019re in a post-truth era now where the spoils won through deceptive demagoguery are clear. Cable news and digitally native publications have turned distortion of facts into a huge business.\n\nMost critically, targeted social network advertising combined with donation links create a perpetual misinformation machine. Politicians can target vulnerable demographics with frightening lies, then say only their financial contribution will let the candidate save them. A few clicks later and the candidate has the cash to buy more ads, amplifying more untruths and raising even more money. Without the friction of having to pick up the phone, mail a letter, or even type in a URL like TV ads request, the feedback loop is shorter and things spiral out of control.\n\nThis is why the social networks should halt sales of political campaign ads now. They\u2019re the one set of stakeholders with flexibility and that could make a united decision. You\u2019ll never get all the politicians and media to be honest, or the public to understand, but just a few companies could set a policy that would protect democracy from the world\u2019s . And they could do it without having to pick sides or make questionable decisions on a case-by-case basis. Just block them all from all candidates.\n\nFacebook wrote in response to Biden\u2019s request to block the Trump ads that \u201cOur approach is grounded in Facebook\u2019s fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\u201d\n\nBut banning campaign ads would still leave room for open political expression that\u2019s subject to public scrutiny. Social networks should continue to let politicians say what they want to their own followers, barring calls for violence. Tech giants can offer a degree of freedom of speech, just not freedom of reach. Whoever wants to listen can, but they shouldn\u2019t be able to jam misinformation into the feeds of the unsuspecting.\n\nIf the tech giants want to stop short of completely banning campaign ads, they could introduce a format designed to minimize misinformation. Politicians could be allowed to simply promote themselves with a set of stock messages, but without the option to make claims about themselves or their opponents.\n\nCampaign ads aren\u2019t a huge revenue driver for social apps, nor are they a high-margin business nowadays. The Trump and Clinton campaigns spent only a combined $81 million on 2016 election ads, a fraction of Facebook\u2019s $27 billion in revenue that year. $284 million was spent in total on 2018 midterm election ads versus Facebook\u2019s $55 billion in revenue last year, says Tech For Campaigns. Zuckerberg even said that Facebook will lose money selling political ads because of all the moderators it hires to weed out election interference by foreign parties.\n\nSurely, there would be some unfortunate repercussions from blocking campaign ads. New candidates in local to national elections would lose a tool for reducing the lead of incumbents, some of which have already benefited from years of advertising. Some campaign ads might be pushed \u201cunderground\u201d where they\u2019re not properly labeled, though the major spenders could be kept under watch.\n\nIf the social apps can still offer free expression through candidates\u2019 own accounts, aren\u2019t reliant on politicians\u2019 cash to survive, won\u2019t police specific lies in their promos, and would rather let the government regulate the situation, then they should respectfully decline to sell campaign advertising. Following the law isn\u2019t enough until the laws adapt. This will be an ongoing issue through the 2020 election, and leaving the floodgates open is irresponsible.\n\nIf a game is dangerous, you don\u2019t eliminate the referee. You stop playing until you can play safe.", "description": "Permitting falsehood in political advertising would work if we had a model democracy, but we don\u2019t.
