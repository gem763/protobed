The great thing about our boys is they don\u2019t give up,\u201d said Wales coach Warren Gatland.\n\n\u201cWe just hung in there today and I\u2019m really proud of the boys because lesser teams would have probably capitulated,\u201d he added.\n\nVahaamahina had stunned the Welsh by bundling over from a lineout after just five minutes before France scored one of the tries of the tournament.\n\nRoared on by chants of \u201cAllez, Les Bleus!\u201d flanker Charles Ollivon stormed through to complete a sweeping move involving Virimi Vakatawa, Romain Ntamack and scrum-half Antoine Dupont.\n\n\u2013 Reckless elbow \u2013\n\nBack came Wales in an electrifying opening 12 minutes as flanker Wainwright pounced on a loose ruck on halfway to race clear for his first Test try.\n\nBiggar slotted a penalty to bring the Six Nations champions to within two points.\n\nBut when a high tackle from substitute Ross Moriarty on Gael Fickou resulted in a yellow card, France made Wales pay as Damian Penaud released Vakatawa to grab France\u2019s third try on the half-hour mark.\n\nFrench playmaker Ntamack struck the post with a penalty just before the break but the pendulum swung towards Wales after Vahaamahina\u2019s rush of blood.\n\nCaught on camera recklessly swinging his elbow flush into Wainwright\u2019s face, it was only ever going to result in a red card.\n\nHis dismissal came as an ironic twist as then Welsh captain Sam Warburton received an early red card for a dangerous tip tackle on Vincent Clerc in that 2011 semi-final in Auckland.\n\nWales, who had won seven of their last eight games against France, were still made to work for it in a nail-biting finish.\n\nBut just when France looked like holding out for a famous victory, Moriarty popped up after a monstrous Welsh scrum.\n\nMaking up for his earlier indiscretion, the replacement forward bulldozed over six minutes from time before Biggar kicked the conversion that broke French hearts.\n\n\u201cI think we were slow out of the blocks today\u2026 but the character we showed to come through,\u201d said Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones.\n\n\u201cObviously there was an advantage in the second half after the card but we kept plugging away and came out on the right side of the scoreboard.\u201d", "description": "Oita (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Substitute Ross Moriarty snatched a late winner as Wales floored 14-man France in a breathless World Cup quarter-final with", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/c3d9a5_wales-needed-late-try-14-man-france-shades-2011-as-wales-floor-14-man-france-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
