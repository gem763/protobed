Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican, and the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (US-AID), Mark Green, who recounted visiting a Yazidi woman in northern Iraq who\u2019d faced the scourge of the Islamic State and showed him a picture of her missing daughters.\n\n\u201cAs if somehow, someway we could find them,\u201d said Mr. Green, appearing to choke up. \u201cSadly, we could not.\u201d\n\nMr. Perkins in recent days has been a vocal critic on social media in countering President Trump\u2019s decision to pull 1,000 troops out of northern Syria in a cessation that, religious liberty observers argue, will lead to devastation and violence upon the region\u2019s Kurdish Christians and Yazidis. However, on Friday, he avoided the subject and stayed, largely, to domestic affairs.\n\nAt a roundtable discussion of people who\u2019ve become the face of the religious liberty debate in America, Mr. Perkins stoked a familiar theme within conservative religious circles, that anti-discrimination policies in cities, states and at the federal law threaten Judeo-Christian values.\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t compromise our convictions and sit and wait to have those terrible penalties,\u201d said Joanna Duka, a wedding designer who challenged a City of Phoenix\u2019s anti-discrimination ordinance that would\u2019ve penalized her, possibly with jail, for refusing to work with gay couples on their wedding planning. Ms. Duka won last month at the Arizona Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cWe are women of faith,\u201d said Ms. Duka. \u201cAnd our art was an extension of that faith.\u201d\n\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell had been scheduled to address the Summit on Friday, but did not attend. The ongoing impeachment machinations on Capitol Hill were not far from the minds of attendees.\n\nOne booth in the entryway from the Heritage Foundation promised the facts on impeachment. Attendees were also warned not to rebroadcast the proceedings without consent, with the video prompter posting an intense-eyed image of House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff, at the center of the Democrats\u2019 push for impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cWe need to censure Adam Schiff for making up his opening testimony,\u201d said Mr. Meadows, to applause from the crowd.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
