Other key aspects of the report included the observations that the resident of the apartment where the blaze began was not at fault, and that the structural use of cladding caused the fire\u2019s spread.\n\nLondon\u2019s fire commissioner, Dany Cotton, defended the emergency services\u2019 response, saying they were dealing with an \u201cunprecedented\u201d situation and were \u201cdisappointed at some of the criticism\u201d levelled at individual staff.\n\nGurbuz Binici /Getty Images, FILE\n\nSurvivors\u2019 groups have welcomed the publication of the report, the first phase of a parliamentary inquiry into the blaze which claimed 72 lives at the 24 story tower block on June 14, 2017.\n\n\u201cWhile nothing can ever bring back our loved ones that passed away in the fire, this is a strong report with a forensic examination of the events of the night,\u201d the survivors\u2019 group Grenfell United said in a statement. Justice means different things for all of us but the truth needs to be at the heart of our collective healing\u2026. Today\u2019s findings give some confidence that our journey towards truth has finally begun.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that \u201cno apology will ever make good the loss suffered,\u201d although he hoped it would \u201cbring some measure of comfort to those who suffered so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe promised them the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owe them the truth. And, today, the whole country, the whole world, is finally hearing the truth about what happened at Grenfell Tower on the 14th of June 2017. For the survivors, the bereaved, and the local community, this report will prove particularly harrowing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet I hope it strengthens their faith in the Inquiry\u2019s desire to determine the facts of the fire,\u201d he said.\n\nA criminal investigation by the Metropolitan Police into the circumstances of the fire is still ongoing.\n\nABC News' Sophia Wang contributed to this report.", "description": "A parliamentary report into the Grenfell tower fire, which killed 72 people in 2017, accused the fire brigade of", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/greenfell-gty-er-191030_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
