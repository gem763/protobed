They turn to their favorite portable phone battery, the myCharge HubPlus Universal. The durable portable battery, which retails for $69.99 on Amazon, gives owners 4-times the extra battery life, and the Kardashians reportedly swear by it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Kourtney and Kim have been spotted with the phone accessory in the past year, preferring to use an external battery instead of the popular charging phone cases, which make your phone eternally heavier. During a recent episode of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim explained to BFF Jonathan Cheban (who said his charging case \"saved [his] life]\") that she \"honestly can't lift\" her phone with the extra weight, because of recent pain she's felt in her hands.\n\nAmazon users are in agreement with the eldest of the Kardashian sisters, with reviewers calling it the \"best portable charger\" on the market.\n\n\"We now own 4! I purchased the first one a year ago. It is great to have with you on days out and about or when traveling. It charges my iPhone several times and will also charge my iPad at the same time!!!\" one person wrote. \"My kids' school now uses iPads for all their school and homework. They must always be charged. I bought 2 more for two of them and then another for the household. You can even it use it as a wall charger lay charging while the charger is plugged in.\"\n\nSomeone else lamented how much we as a society use our smartphones these days, but noted that this helps feed that habit.\n\n\"I bought this for my wife because she took a new position in the city so traveling on the bus and browsing all her Instagram and Facebook friends, liking and disliking, emojis and lulz with the videos can drain a battery really quickly,\" the review read. \"It is quite amazing, charging multiple devices when it's full, the different cables are attached so you don't to worry about losing or forgetting a certain cable needed for whatever device. It's gotten to the point where she will use it at home even when I remind her that we have outlets and real chargers but she carries that thing around like a baby.\"\n\nGet your own myCharge HubPlus Universal on Amazon here.", "description": "Kim and Kourtney Kardashian have both been spotted using the same portable phone battery in the last year.", "authors": ["Gibson Johns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8OngyPOyWqBbYsoMI5a_tQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1028x674+0+0/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/63086b60-e53e-11e9-bf2f-54b9c1f9649a", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
