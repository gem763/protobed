Tensions flared between the two following the ruling.\n\nLee said in an interview with Japan's Asahi newspaper released on Friday that he might deliver a letter from Moon expressing his willingness to work together to resolve disagreement over the forced labour issue.\n\nAn official at Moon's office said he and Lee had discussed the idea, but a decision on it had not yet been taken.\n\n\"Our fundamental position is that politics and economic issues should be handled separately and we hope to foster forward-looking relations and resolve problems through dialogue,\" the official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the ties.\n\nJapan says the wartime labour issue was settled under the 1965 treaty that normalised ties.\n\nThe dispute has since spilled over into trade and security, with Japan slapping export curbs and South Korea scrapping a bilateral intelligence-sharing pact.\n\n(Reporting by Hyonhee Shin; Additional reporting by Christopher Gallagher; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)", "description": "South Korea's Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon is expected to meet Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe next Thursday in what would be the highest-level talks between the two countries since Tokyo imposed export curbs in a deepening trade and diplomatic spat, Seoul officials said on Friday.
