Now, for 2020, the rugged subcompact crossover receives an abundance of interior changes, a few exterior tweaks, and a start-stop system.\n\nGas-model Crosstreks with the continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) receive a standard automatic start-stop system as well as Subaru's SI-DRIVE driver-selectable powertrain management system. The SI-DRIVE system includes Intelligent and Sport modes and can be controlled via switches on the steering wheel.\n\nOutside, the Limited and Hybrid trim level Crosstreks receive updated LED headlight design, with the Hybrid being distinguished with silver trim along the projector beams. LED fog lights are standard on the Limited.\n\nPhoto credit: Subaru More\n\nInside is an array of minor functionality and media port location changes. The Premium trim now offers an optional six-way power driver's seat and push to start, and an illuminated front console storage tray is standard on both the Premium and Limited trim models. On all Crosstrek models, the USB and auxiliary ports have been moved from the center console to the front console storage tray. The Limited and Hybrid models add additional USB ports in the rear console.\n\nNew safety features include an automatic power door locking and unlocking system that operates when the car is put into drive and the vehicle's speed is more than 13 mph as well as a collision detection system that automatically unlocks all of the doors in the event of an accident.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "Selectable driving modes are now standard for all Crosstreks, too.", "authors": ["Connor Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/82u8Z6SuQEREI37aPr.r2w--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/car_and_driver_581/6b32985b4b27a2d8ebbbacabbed47e03", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
