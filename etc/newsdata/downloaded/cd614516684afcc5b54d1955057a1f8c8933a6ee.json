Amy Klobuchar on Friday said President Trump was \u201cbasically threatening execution\u201d when he invoked treason in talking about a whistleblower who alleged that the president improperly pressed Ukraine for dirt on a political opponent.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s basically there threatening execution,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cHe is calling someone that works for him and the whistleblower a spy, right?\u201d\n\nAt a private event on Thursday, Mr. Trump mentioned treason amid the ongoing firestorm over the whistleblower complaint, which helped prompt Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce that the House is formally opening an impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nMs. Klobuchar, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, said Mr. Trump was trying to raise a \u201cchilling effect\u201d with the comments.\n\n\u201cWe just have to call on the patriotism of people that used to work in that White House or work there now to come forward and tell the truth,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Klobuchar said the chain of events made sense to her and cited news reports in referring to the whistleblower as a \u201cCIA agent.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has a very disturbing conversation about getting dirt [on] one of his opponents for the 2020 election, and then, of course, someone that heard about it talks to a trusted CIA agent \u2026 who has expertise on Ukraine, and that\u2019s how he finds it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is legitimate discussions between security people who are involved [who] care about our country.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
