New data shows why.", "language": "en", "text": "That\u2019s when Trump concluded the jig was up on Doral, the New York Times reports. Trump issued two tweets nixing the plan, but took a break between them to watch Jeanine Pirro on Fox \u2014 another indicator of how closely he\u2019s monitoring the network as he assesses the holding power of his defensive ramparts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA new study just out from the Public Religion Research Institute sheds light on this dynamic in a remarkable way: It shows that rank-and-file Republicans who watch Fox are far more loyal to Trump than those who do not.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 Americans, finds that an astonishing 55 percent of Republicans who watch Fox News as their primary news source say there is almost nothing Trump could do to lose their approval. By contrast, only 29 percent of Republicans who don\u2019t cite Fox as their primary source say this.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, 98 percent of Fox-citing Republicans oppose impeaching and removing Trump \u2014 opposition that\u2019s \u201cessentially unanimous,\u201d as PRRI puts it. By contrast, 90 percent of non-Fox-citing Republicans oppose impeaching and removing him \u2014 which is overwhelmingly high, but suggests that among this group, at least, Trump could suffer losses on the margins as the inquiry turns up worse revelations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAnd here\u2019s another real doozy: In response to my inquiry, PRRI tells me that 71 percent of Fox-citing Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while only 39 percent of non-Fox-citing Republicans strongly approve of him.\n\n\u201cThe numbers show that Republicans who watch Fox News tend to be much more pro-Trump,\u201d Natalie Jackson, the research director for PRRI, told me. \u201cFox seems to be a powerful vehicle for Trump support.\u201d\n\nOf Republicans overall, 44 percent say Fox is their primary source \u2014 meaning we\u2019re talking about a very large chunk of the GOP base. \u201cWhat Fox is putting out there is really impacting Republicans\u2019 opinions,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nOn impeachment, Fox News figures have put out nonstop disinformation. They regularly claim the inquiry is invalid absent a full House vote (which is baseless); that Trump did nothing wrong in the Ukraine scandal (he pressured a foreign leader to help him rig our election by investigating potential opponent Joe Biden); that the whistleblower has been discredited (his complaint perfectly captured what Trump actually did); and that Biden did the same or worse (which is based on a fabricated narrative).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Fox effect\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to say whether Republicans watch Fox because they\u2019re already in lockstep with Trump, or whether they\u2019re inclined that way because of what Fox tells them. But these things seem to reinforce one another \u2014 and that may prove a significant factor in keeping GOP lawmakers in line behind him.\n\n\u201cHis core constituency seems to be these Fox-watching Republicans,\u201d Jackson told me, adding that such strong numbers among those voters mean that \u201cRepublicans in Congress are going to be less likely to turn against Trump.\u201d\n\nOf course, some GOP lawmakers will remain behind Trump because they actively approve of his efforts in this matter. But this is probably related to the Fox effect as well. Trump has adopted the unabashed posture that demanding the sham investigation of Biden is the affirmatively correct thing to do under the circumstances, and some GOP lawmakers are with him on this.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFox is pushing similar messages \u2014 Trump is absolutely within his authority to call for an investigation of Biden, the truly corrupt figure in this situation; Trump is the real victim here (of the \u201cdeep state\u201d). This hermetically sealed-off universe has created a space in which Republicans are backing Trump because he\u2019s only done right.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the 1970s anymore\n\nThere\u2019s an additional perversity here that could have a major impact on how all of this unfolds.\n\nA debate is stirring over whether the only plausible way to get the Senate to remove Trump after the House impeaches is through massive popular mobilization, a case originally made by Brian Beutler. The idea is that things are vastly different than in Richard Nixon\u2019s day.\n\nAD\n\nBack then, the two-party system was less rigid, and the far-less-fractured media environment was dominated by a few major networks. The prospect of party defections driven by principled reactions to empirically determined misconduct was more realistic. As David Leonhardt notes, \u201cthe elite institutions that helped bring down Richard Nixon\u201d are \u201cweaker today.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut what makes this worse is that, even as our institutions are weaker, there is simultaneously an institution of sorts lined up forcefully behind Trump \u2014 Fox News \u2014 which is carrying out a self-assigned institutional role with reasonable success. Historians have noted that Nixon had nothing like it at his disposal. This both underscores the case for a popular mobilization and suggests how overwhelming it would need to be to move the required 20 GOP senators.\n\nNobody understands this better than Trump, who has aggressively attacked Fox when it occasionally strays from that role. But on impeachment, Fox has largely stuck to it, and it\u2019s hard to see that changing. These new numbers suggest it\u2019s having a real impact, and could even help Trump survive.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Fox-watching Republicans are in lockstep behind Trump.", "authors": ["Greg Sargent", "Opinion Writer Covering National Politics", "Opinion Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DwnaQ0I29v843c2Vm1sVFWphrIE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F6KTBDXUAEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
