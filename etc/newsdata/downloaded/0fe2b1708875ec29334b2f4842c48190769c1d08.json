The South Africans described it as a warmup for the sport\u2019s marquee tournament.\n\nEither way, the 41-7 result doesn\u2019t seem to be an accurate barometer of current form, considering Japan\u2019s historic progress to a quarterfinal match against the Springboks on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that no other team in the World Cup quarterfinals have had,\u201d Joseph said, \u201cand I think that\u2019s going to be a benefit for us.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa coach Rassie Erasmus figured the big win in Kumagaya on Sept. 6 might mean people were less inclined to talk about Japan\u2019s shocking upset win over the Springboks at the 2015 World Cup, a 34-32 triumph that has been dubbed the \u201cMiracle of Brighton.\u201d\n\nThat was never going to work. As soon as Japan beat Scotland to confirm top spot in Pool A and a place in the Rugby World Cup knockout stage for the first time, the Brighton game was always going to be a theme for the week.\n\nNot that it factors into Joseph\u2019s planning. He wasn\u2019t head coach four years ago, when Japan won three pool games but didn\u2019t reach the quarterfinals, so the expectations on him are different.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to forget about that for the last four years,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cWe\u2019re a different team. That was an amazing achievement for the last World Cup. We\u2019re sort of working on our own thing.\u201d\n\nErasmus was content doing his own thing, too. Although that doesn\u2019t mean any dramatic departures from what the Springboks have done for decades.\n\nHe announced his team for the quarterfinals a day ahead of schedule, figuring there was no point holding back a lineup clearly picked with the intention of battering Japan. He went for the most aggressive forward pack he could start with, and loaded the eight-man reserves bench with six forwards.\n\nThen he reiterated, step-by-step, the plan to grind down Japan\u2019s high-energy game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear what South Africa is going to do,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cBeing very direct, very physical \u2026 a clear sign of the intent. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been preparing for all week.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s not so clear is what we\u2019re going to do - that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to!\u201d\n\nJoseph made only one injury-enforced change to its lineup to face South Africa after fullback William Tupou failed a head-injury assessment and was replaced by Ryohei Yamanaka.\n\nCaptain Michael Leitch, winger Kotaro Matsushima, hooker Shota Horie and lock Luke Thompson started in the 2015 win over South Africa and are back in the XV again. There are eight players in all returning from that squad. Prop Keita Inagaki and flyhalf Yu Tamura were on the bench four years ago but are in the starting lineup for Sunday, while Fumiaki Tanaka and Amanaki Lelei Mafi are again on the bench.\n\nJapan achieved its pre-tournament target by reaching the knockout stage on home soil. Time to re-set, Leitch said.\n\n\u201cThis is not the end of the story,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not satisfied. The match we had four years ago, the world started to focus on the Japan rugby team - surprised - and the fans of Japan were struck with how we played. We\u2019ve got the chance to do it live in front of the Japanese people again.\u201d\n\nVeteran prop Tendai Mtawarira and hooker Bongi Mbonambi forced their way into the starting pack for South Africa after missing out on the opening pool-stage loss to defending champion New Zealand, with Erasmus expecting them to have a big impact at the set piece.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret,\u201d Erasmus said of the plan to try to outmuscle the smaller but faster Japan pack. The idea is to \u201cnullify the space around the tight forwards, with the pace that they have. And to play toward our strengths, which is physical rugby, set phases, mauling, scrums.\u201d\n\nJapan has outright speed out wide, with Matsushima tied as the leading tryscorer in the tournament so far with five and Kenki Fukuoka\u2019s match-winning double against Scotland raising his tally to four. South Africa\u2019s Cheslin Kolbe is of a similar pace and stature, and also knows his way to the tryline. Otherwise, the South Africans number up bigger across the board.\n\nMtawarira, lock Lood De Jager and flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit started in the loss to Japan four years ago, and are more prepared this time after the big win in the warmup - or rehearsal - in Kumagaya.\n\n\u201cThey definitely try to pick up the pace of the game in all aspects. For us, it\u2019s about being ready for it - to expect the quick lineouts, to be set early,\u201d De Jager said. \u201cWe are going to stick to our plan and what we know.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t that well prepared in Brighton. But they still beat us fair and square that day - we are not making any excuses. I think that warmup game we played before the World Cup against Japan really puts us in good stead for the quarterfinal.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It wasn't lost in translation, more a difference in perspective.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Pye"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
