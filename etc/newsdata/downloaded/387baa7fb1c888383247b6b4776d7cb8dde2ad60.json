The 592 hp V8-powered car completed the circuit in 1:37.54.\n\nHowever, the Jaguar was offered in a limited production run of 300 cars for $187,500 each, while the Tesla is still being developed and won\u2019t be on sale until next year, making its record unofficial for the time being.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM FOX NEWS AUTOS\n\nElon Musk tweeted that the car features a new three-motor \u201cPlaid\u201d powertrain \u2013 two in the rear, one in the front \u2013 that it will share with the Model X and upcoming Roadster two-door. The current Model S features one motor at each end.\n\nThe colorful name is a reference to the comedy film \u201cSpaceballs,\u201d where the villain\u2019s starship goes from \u201cludicrous speed\u201d to \u201cplaid,\u201d depicted as the fastest speed possible. The high-performance Tesla Model S P100D already offers a \u201cLudicrous Mode\u201d that enables the quickest acceleration.\n\nMusk said the Plaid Model S will cost more than the current version, which has a base price of $101,115, but less than its main competitor, the recently-revealed Porsche Taycan Turbo S that starts at $188,960. The battery-powered Porsche has claimed its own unofficial track at Germany\u2019s 13-mile-long Nurburgring, where a prototype holds the fastest time for an electric sedan. For now.\n\nPORSCHE TAYCAN DEBUTS AS THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL SEDAN:\n\nTesla is in the process of testing and tuning a Model S in Germany that Musk said may try to set a lap time next week. According to Road and Track, a private session has been scheduled at the facility for Sept. 21, which may be when Tesla is planning to make the attempt. Photos of the car reveal it sports a revised cooling system, flared fenders and a set of the highest-performance street-legal tires currently available from Michelin.\n\nAccording to Musk, it is also equipped with a pair of rear-facing jump seats under its lift-back, which is a Model S option that turns it into a 7-passenger car and would make a potential record even more specific.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Fending off new competition.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
