Stream the month\u2019s best music playlist on Spotify or Apple Music.\n\nThe former Fifth Harmony member\u2019s best single to date bears clear evidence of co-writer Ariana Grande\u2019s influence. Normani breezes through the verses as if skipping down a crystalline staircase, just as Grande usually does. But Normani also has inimitable charisma, evincing her supreme confidence that she\u2019s absolutely the only one who can please her man by taking a light touch to the delivery; no sledgehammer required. It\u2019s brassy and excellently sloganeering \u2013 \u201clet me be your motivation \u2026 let me be your inspiration\u201d \u2013 and has a proper dancing-in-the-rain, flirting-on-the-basketball-court smash of a video to match. LS\n\nAustralian pop-star-in-waiting Cxloe has written the anthem for an era in which fans express their love by asking their favourite stars to step their necks or run them over with a truck. Sick isn\u2019t about pining politely: \u201cI need you to make me sick / Love me out my mind,\u201d she pleads, channelling some of Lorde\u2019s dangerous intimacy, all tapered, gasping vocal delivery writhing through producer Gnash\u2019s beats. Probably not what the doctor ordered, but when life is tempered through screens and a generation of young rappers and pop stars ooze numbed pain, her demand for a visceral, mind-overhauling kind of obsession sounds quite appealing.

Now 66, she is releasing her first solo album, No Home Record, and the lead single places her signature ashy tone front and centre. She declaims menacingly and obliquely \u2013 \u201caliveness is an objection, affected me\u201d \u2013 as a bass clarinet shudders like the surface of dark water, and percussive blasts detonate at random. It\u2019s an unnerving landscape that becomes strangely moving when a pocket of reflection opens up, Gordon musing about a day \u201cin the sunlight, dreaming in a tent\u201d. The sound of forlorn acoustic guitar appears, seeming to mock her bucolic reverie. LS\n\nTuareg rockers Tinariwen have always made music that reflects the desert setting of its creation: loose, sparsely populated and full of stark contrasts. For their ninth album, the group rehearsed in the Moroccan Sahara en route to recording in Mauritania. You can almost hear a sand-laden breeze waft through the background on Kel Tinawen as singer Ibrahim Ag Alhabib employs his gravelly baritone as a counterpoint to indie star Cass McCombs\u2019s spangly guitars, a chorus of backing vocals keeping the mid-tempo groove undulating. It is imaginative music, a song to place the listener squarely within Tinariwen\u2019s universe, regardless of where you are listening. AK\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Miley Cyrus. Photograph: Christopher Polk/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nNot a tribute to Definitely Maybe on its 25th anniversary \u2013 though admirably brazen in title \u2013 Slide Away is Miley Cyrus\u2019s eulogy for her marriage to actor Liam Hemsworth. And it\u2019s beautiful. Her dramatic vocal turn in the verses traces the scale of what they had \u2013 paradise, paralysing \u2013 only to shrink again, conveying the sense of necessary retreat in her lovely, limpid chorus: \u201cSo won\u2019t you slide away? / Back to the ocean, I\u2019ll go back to the city lights.\u201d Like Ariana Grande\u2019s Thank U, Next, it\u2019s a dignified, adult breakup song \u2013 not score-settling, but honouring what was before moving on. LS\n\nPelada are Montreal electronic duo Chris Vargas and Tobias Rochman. Set to release their debut album on Pan this autumn, they came up through the city\u2019s rave scene (the one that birthed Grimes a decade ago), distinguishing themselves by pairing Rochman\u2019s hardware-focused production with unusual live vocals by Vargas, who rails in Spanish against power, surveillance and politics. While Vargas has cited the influence of their childhood exposure to cumbia on Pelada\u2019s sound, Ajetreo (hustle and bustle) hews closer to the hectic, compressed kuduro sound that travelled from Angola to Lisbon\u2019s electronic scene: Rochman gives the beat a junkyard patina that offers a playful contrast with his slippery pitch-shifting. LS\n\nSince winning the Mobo for best jazz act in 2015 with drummer Moses Boyd, saxophonist Binker Golding has become one of the key sidemen in the renascent London jazz scene, blowing coruscating sheets of free improvisation with Boyd, tasteful balladry with singer Zara McFarlane and challenging bebop with pianist Elliot Galvin. With his first quartet album as bandleader out in September, single ... And I Like Your Feathers is a subtly intricate number featuring a breezy interplay between Golding and bassist Daniel Casimir. It\u2019s straight-ahead jazz but loses none of its potency for it; Golding shows that his playing isn\u2019t to be relegated to a dinner party background. AK\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Megan Thee Stallion. Photograph: Noam Galai/Getty Images for MTV\n\nA quick catch-up, for anyone not primed in the hot girl summer meme: Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion has various aliases, including the Hot Girl. A few months back, a fan declared this a \u201chot girl summer\u201d, and a meme was born, mostly revolving around Instagram posts of people showing off their hot bods. Obviously, brands from makeup companies to fast food chains leapt on it, almost killing it stone dead. But on the brink of summer\u2019s burnout, Megan revived it with a titular anthem. It\u2019s surprisingly laid back, but then, what is the essence of hot girl summer if not having nothing to prove? Getting Nicki Minaj (with her best verse in months) and Ty Dolla $ign (who arguably dominates too much) is bragging rights enough. Though Megan \u2013 her voice brilliantly thick with cynicism \u2013 packs in a few for good measure. \u201cGot a whole lot of options \u2019cause you know a bitch poppin\u2019.\u201d LS\n\nLana Del Rey\u2019s frame of reference is well established: Americana, essentially, as her new album\u2019s brilliant title, Norman Fucking Rockwell!, makes plain. But now and then, another (probably accidental) reference rears up in her music: the ironclad, turn-of-the-millennium songwriting of Robbie Williams collaborator Guy Chambers. It\u2019s there in the classic piano arrangement of The Greatest, a song about precisely the opposite of such triumphalism: the end of a relationship, the climate crisis, how \u201cKanye West is blond and gone\u201d. If this is the end, at least Del Rey gives it a gorgeous coda. LS\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Highwomen. Photograph: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Essential Broadcast Media, LLC\n\nThe Highwomen are country supergroup Brandi Carlile, Amanda Shires, Maren Morris and Natalie Hemby; their mission closing the still staggering gender gap in country music. For their theme song, they involved Jimmy Webb in a rewrite of his 1975 hit that became the founding text for country supergroup the Highwaymen (comprising Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson) in 1985. But with a difference: the quartet don\u2019t paint themselves as heroic outlaws, but revamp the original to reference the fates that befell women who dared to step outside society\u2019s bounds. The group\u2019s debut album will feature various guests: here, Bristol soul singer Yola and Sheryl Crow add to the quartet\u2019s stirring vocal harmonies.
