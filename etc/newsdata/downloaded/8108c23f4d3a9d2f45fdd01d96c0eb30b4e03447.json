I was living in the top room of this house in East London. Everyone had gone home for Easter, and I was alone. I\u2019d nicked someone\u2019s video player from their room. I watched Blue Velvet and I was running a bath and I was standing in my robe.\n\nHe\u2019s next up in Doctor Sleep (Picture: Rex Features)\n\n\u2018And I had this terrible pain in my back. I ripped off my robe. And there was this burn mark; the back of my robe was scorched. I ran around thinking I caught fire or something.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOh lord.\n\nAfter the actor failed to find the source of the burn, he understandably fled to his uncle\u2019s house to spend the night.\n\nBecause his house is evidently haunted, right?\n\nAfter he built up the courage to return, Ewan said he told his downstairs neighbour what had happened, with his neighbour going pale.\n\n\u2018I said, What the f**k? I eventually teased it out of him,\u2019 he continued.\n\n\u2018An old, Jewish, reclusive guy had owned the flat before. He never really left the place, and it was full of newspapers. His brother used to come and give him a cooked meal two or three times a week. His brother got ill and hadn\u2019t been over for a few days.\n\n\u2018The guy was in the kitchen \u2013 putting the pan on \u2013 and he fainted because he was so hungry. And this pot boiled and set fire to the kitchen.\n\n\u2018The people upstairs smelled the burning and dragged him out of the kitchen. But he died of the burn marks to his back. Every night after that, my door would open, the phone would ring, things would move around.\u2019\n\nOh, we\u2019d be out of there quicker than you can say \u2018do you smell burning?\u2019\n\nEwan was, too, as he added: \u2018I did get out of there two weeks later.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
