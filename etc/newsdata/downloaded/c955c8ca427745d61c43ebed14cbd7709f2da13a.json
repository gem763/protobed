So Peter Moyo showed up for work at Old Mutual's Sandton building yesterday morning, but was again barred from entering his office. The High Court in Johannesburg on Friday upheld an earlier ruling allowing the on-again, off-again Old Mutual CEO to return to work until the appeal process has been concluded. But Old Mutual disputed this, claiming that Moyo did not challenge the contractual validity of his second sacking last month. Moyo and his lawyers now want a board resolution that confirms that he can\u2019t work.\n\n2. MTN has been fined R5m \u2013 with R2m suspended for three years \u2013 after it didn\u2019t give authorities enough warning before it hiked the price of its 1GB Monthly WhatsApp bundles. In April last year, MTN lowered the bundle price to R10. It saw a 300% increase in WhatsApp usage in just eight weeks, which it said threatened its 3G network. In July, it hiked the price by R10 to R30. It only gave the Independent Communications Authority of SA (Icasa) two working days\u2019 notice before the increase took effect. It is obliged to give the authority at least seven days\u2019 notice. But MTN will fight the penalty, and it is taking the decision on review to the High Court.\n\n3.

For the first time in recorded history, last year people over the age of 64 outnumbered children 5 years of age and younger.\n\nThough better medical technology is a large factor in this shift, the Global Burden of Disease Study also cited a decreased interest in having large families as another key reason why the global fertility rate has been cut in half since 1950.\n\nThis is a phenomenon that transcends borders - but some nations and administrative regions are clearly at the forefront of this trend.\n\nThe World Bank records the percentage of people in each country and region under the age of 15.
