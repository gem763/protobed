Now, the Libyan government has agreed to transfer the body of the Ghanaian, Matthew Ayariga, which has until now gone unclaimed, to the Martyrs of Faith and Homeland Church, built as a shrine to the 21 men who sacrificed their lives for the Christian faith.\n\nNews of the transfer agreement was shared by Father Abi Fanus Unan, who serves at the shrine, in a briefing last week to a group of Catholic journalists and educators, including Crux, sponsored by the Philos Project, an organization dedicated to \u201cpromoting positive Christian engagement in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe Coptic Orthodox priest said that he met with the Libyan ambassador two months ago at the request of Bishop Bevnotious, the Coptic Orthodox Bishop of Samalout, but said that no date has been set for the transfer.\n\nThe newly opened shrine to the 21 martyrs was built by the Armed Forces under Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and contains their remains under the main altar, as well as individual coffins for each of the men, along with remnants of their faded and bloodstained jump suits.\n\nPope Tawadros II, head of the Coptic Orthodox Church, has already declared the men to be saints and their feast day on the Orthodox calendar is on February 15, the feast day of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.\n\nPope Francis has spoken of the 21 martyrs on multiple occasions since their gruesome death, writing to Tawdros to say that \u201ctoday more than ever we are united by the ecumenism of blood, which further encourages us on the path towards peace and reconciliation.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Catholic Church has not officially recognized the men as saints, Francis has repeatedly referred to the men as martyrs.\n\n\u201cTheir only words were: \u2018Jesus, help me!\u2019 They were killed simply for the fact that they were Christians,\u201d he said in 2015. \u201cThe blood of our Christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out to be heard. It makes no difference whether they be Catholics, Orthodox, Copts or Protestants. They are Christians!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe martyrs belong to all Christians,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a separate briefing last week, the Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria, Ibrahim Isaac Sidrak, referred to the 21 martyrs as \u201cexemplary Christians.\u201d\n\nOn hand for the Philos Project briefing at the shrine were family members for 13 of the martyrs, who repeatedly described the deaths of their sons, fathers, and brothers as an \u201chonor\u201d and a \u201cjoy.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, in an interview with Crux earlier this year, author Martin Mosebach, whose recent book, The 21: A Journey into the Land of Coptic Martyrs, described his experience with their family members as one that would astonish much of the western world.\n\nRELATED: Author holds up martyred Copts as model for contemporary Christians\n\n\u201cI found a completely different point of view of martyrdom. No lamentation, no mourning, no pity, but, instead, pride and happiness. This was not seen as an injustice or an incident that should not have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThese were people with very simple theologies, but it was a real theology.\u201d\n\nWhile the video footage of the deaths of the 21 Christians stunned much of the world, many Coptic Christians have since lamented that the events seem to have been quickly forgotten \u2014 though in the rural village of Al Our, the presence of their family members seemed to be a plea for both remembrance and continued attention to the ongoing realities of Christians in the region.\n\n\u201cIt is an honor for me,\u201d the father of Yousef Shokry Younan told Crux, in describing his first reaction learning of the death of his 24-year-old son.\n\nThe father of Mena Fayez Aziz, also killed at age 24, concurred.\n\n\u201cIt is a joy for me,\u201d he said, \u201cand a gift to the entire world to know what can happen with this witness for Christ.\u201d\n\nFollow Christopher White on Twitter: @cwwhite212\n\nCrux is dedicated to smart, wired and independent reporting on the Vatican and worldwide Catholic Church.
