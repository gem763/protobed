Four of them are playing in this match. One is now a limited-overs specialist who hasn\u2019t played a red-ball game for almost a year. Six are still knocking around in Championship cricket, with varying degrees of success, although you could argue that one of them isn\u2019t actually a batsman any more. One is unemployed after being released by his county at the end of the season. The 15 different opening batsmen that England have tried since the retirement of Andrew Strauss in 2012 have met with a variety of fates, but one thing links them all: none of them lasted very long. Until now.\n\nIt took one of the balls of the day from Josh Hazlewood to finally shift Rory Burns (No 13) from his five-hour vigil. But in that time, he had done enough. Not enough, perhaps, to save his side from defeat in the fourth Test. Not enough to complete his second Test century. But enough to prove to himself, to his team-mates and to English cricket at large that finally, their search for a reliable presence at the top of the order is at an end.\n\nA Test opener bats in three dimensions. The first two \u2013 runs and time \u2013 are clearly the most important, but top-order batsmen in particular have a third imperative: mood. Their job is to set the tone, which involves more than simply keeping the scoreboard moving. The best openers emanate a sense of permanence that can waft through the rest of the dressing room like a pleasant aroma. Jonathan Trott (No 5) was particularly gifted in this respect, which is what made his brief recall as opener in 2015 so jarringly horrifying to watch. And to watch Burns and Joe Root (No 2) batting at Old Trafford on Friday, chipping away at Australia\u2019s mammoth first-innings total, was to feel that rarest of sensations for followers of English cricket in recent years: calm.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Seven years after Strauss\u2019s retirement broke up one of England\u2019s greatest ever opening partnerships, the rookie England opener stepping into the breach now has to face not just a fresh new ball and the world\u2019s best bowlers, but the weight of all the failures that have gone before him. It\u2019s a fatalism that rests not in the player himself, but one he can sniff in the air around him from the moment his name comes out of the selection hat: the nervous tension of a crowd willing them on through gritted teeth, the familiar mumble that accompanies their first play and miss.\n\nAnd so when Burns steps out to open the innings for England, in a way he\u2019s not simply battling the opposition. He\u2019s fighting the ghosts of honest triers like Sam Robson (No 4) and Adam Lyth (No 6) and Ben Duckett (No 9) and Michael Carberry (No 3), the memories of failed experiments like Moeen Ali (No 7), and a watching public that on some repressed level already expects him to fail and has mentally prepared themselves for that exact outcome before he has even faced his first delivery.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

England were 472 runs behind, the Ashes were slipping away and Hazlewood was putting it exactly where he wanted it. Burns himself was coming off two low scores in Leeds and the lingering suspicion that his century in Birmingham had been a flukey aberration rather than a genuine measure of his class.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t chanceless here, either. But in many ways, this was a far superior effort to his Edgbaston knock. After a few early scares, he climbed into Mitchell Starc, taking him for eight in an over to get England moving. Nathan Lyon was introduced for an early bowl and Burns resolved to play him off the back foot, cutting him well through point and cover.\n\nPat Cummins arrived to deliver his usual fusillade of head-bangers and rib-ticklers. This, in hindsight, was the key period of Burns\u2019s innings. Australia have been probing this area of Burns\u2019s game all series, convinced that he\u2019s vulnerable to well-directed bumpers from over the wicket. Torn between allowing Australia to keep bowling there and trying to hit them off their plans, Burns chose a middle path. He withstood, held his nerve, got under the head-high stuff, got on top of anything lower, and eventually hooked Hazlewood fine for four.\n\nThe return of Starc, hit for 12 in his first over back, allowed Burns to reach his fifty. And as fresh afternoon melted into chilly evening, as the England fans cheered themselves by goading Lyon over his missed run-out at Headingley, as Australia began to look increasingly ragged, Burns could survey the scene with more than a little satisfaction. Against the best attack in world cricket, in the biggest series of them all, he had seen them off.\n\nA century would have been a fitting reward, but in truth Burns\u2019s eventual dismissal for 81 had been telegraphed a little in advance. He was beaten a few times by Cummins and Lyon, almost run out attempting a quick single, nearly caught at cover trying to cut the spinner. This is the third dimension of Test batting: even with runs on the board and time in the bank, the evaporation of England\u2019s composure would ultimately prove their undoing.\n\nAs England\u2019s evening wobble proved, such a state of mind can be highly transient. But a measure of how adeptly Burns helmed England for most of the day was how frenetic they looked after he departed. His dismissal seemed to snap them out of their trance. Root looked discomfited and went LBW soon after; Roy (No 15) made a few quick runs but never got remotely close to serenity. As England limped to stumps, the calmness of Burns felt like a distant memory.\n\nStill, he could be pleased with his day\u2019s work. A testament to Burns\u2019s excellence this series is how his counterparts have struggled. Burns now has 323 runs in this series at an average of almost 50. The other five openers in this series \u2013 David Warner, Marcus Harris, Cameron Bancroft, Denly and Roy \u2013 have 224 between them, at an average of just above 10. Whatever happens between now and the end of the series, Burns has surpassed all expectations.\n\nThe next Test match will be his 12th in a row. None of his most recent predecessors in the role \u2013 not Keaton Jennings (No 11) or Alex Hales (No 8) or Mark Stoneman (No 12) or Nick Compton (No 1) \u2013 ever got that far. And while his average of 30 may still be a little short of Haseeb Hameed (No 10), while he may have ridden his luck at times, Burns has at least done enough to secure himself a full winter touring schedule and a good deal of patience. Whisper it, but England\u2019s seven-year itch may, at last, have been scratched.", "description": "Three of them have retired. Four of them are playing in this match.
