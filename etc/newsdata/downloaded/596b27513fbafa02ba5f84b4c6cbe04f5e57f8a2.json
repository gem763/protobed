No sex or spicy food, says monk who claims to be 124 years old", "language": "en", "text": "An Indian monk who claims to be 124 years old left airport security staff in Dubai aghast when he presented his passport during a stopover.\n\nSwami Sivananda was en-route from Kolkata to London when murmurs spread of his age, after which photos spread on social media of the gentleman with various employees at Abu Dhabi International Airport.\n\nWhile doubts exist as to the validity of the date of birth (August 8, 1896) on his document, Sivananda puts his longevity down to a lifelong regime involving plenty of yoga, no sex or \"fancy foods\", and sleeping on just a mat with a wooden slab for a pillow.\n\nIndian passport authorities obtained Sivananda's birth records from a temple register, according to Gulf News, making it difficult to verify.\n\nOne social media user, Bint Bilaad Al Harmain stated: \u201cThese ages are often not true because of the lack of identity documents and available data back in the old days. While the birth dates may be accurate for some, there are parents that would not have been able to remember all the dates of when their children were born.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Annabel Fenwick Elliott", "Senior Content Editor", "Hugh Morris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/2019/September/monk-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
