Col. Alexander Vindman before the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees will mark the first time lawmakers investigating the impeachment inquiry will hear from someone who listened to Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 the call at the center of the House's impeachment investigation that included a request that Ukraine investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I was concerned by the call,\" Vindman wrote. \"I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine.\"\n\nIn the six-page opening statement, Vindman, a key member of the National Security Council, outlines his dedicated service to the country, including his two decades as an Army officer, which included a tour in Iraq where he was wounded in an IED attack and awarded a Purple Heart. He says his family fled the Soviet Union and immigrated to New York City in 1979, giving him a deep appreciation of the American dream.\n\n\"I am a patriot,\" he says in the statement. \"And it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective of party or politics.\"\n\nVindman offers an overview of his role within the Trump administration in the testimony, including being tasked to attend Zelensky's inauguration in May, and details two specific events that he found concerning, \"inappropriate\" and led to him reporting the situation to the National Security Council's top lawyer.\n\nThe first was in July when a number of officials, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton, Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland \u2014 two key witnesses that have testified to lawmakers \u2014 and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who resigned earlier this month, met with Oleksandr Danylyuk, Ukraine's Secretary of National Security and Defense Council, according to the testimony.\n\nThe meeting in Washington was going well until the Ukrainians asked about a potential meeting between Trump and Zelensky, Vindman writes. That was when Sondland \"started to speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the President.\"\n\nBolton then cut the meeting short, according to the testimony. Vindman wrote that after the meeting there was a debriefing where he confronted Sondland, saying \"his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push.\"\n\nIt was after that meeting that Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council's chief lawyer.\n\nVindman said he reported a second concern after listening to Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, where the president talked about military aid for the country, then asked about investigations into Biden and 2016 election.\n\nHe said Ukraine launching such investigations would push partisan politics into helping Ukraine fend off Russia, which would \"undermine U.S. national security.\"\n\nThe New York Times first reported on Vindman's opening statement.", "description": "Lt.
