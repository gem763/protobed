Today, we've put together a short video to give you a more visual idea of how the game works up a sweat.\n\nPlease don't judge my exercise form too harshly. Working out on camera was not in my official job description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStick around all the way to the end of the video, too, to see our quick examination of how Ring Fit Adventure compares to a real Pilates ring (which does not interact with your Nintendo Switch in any way). I had to lie down on the ground in a New York City park to film this portion of the video, so I really hope you enjoy it.", "description": "Judge my exercise form as I judge Nintendo's new exercise game.", "authors": ["Kyle Orland"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ringfitadventurears2-760x380.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
