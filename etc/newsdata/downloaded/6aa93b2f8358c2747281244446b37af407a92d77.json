(September 30, 2019) (Jerome Taylor/AFP)\n\nHong Kong \u2013 Starbucks has emerged as the latest brand to fall foul of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters after a family member of the restaurant chain that owns the local franchise spoke out against demonstrators.\n\nMultiple branches were covered with graffiti over the weekend as the city witnessed some of the most intense clashes between hardcore protesters and riot police in weeks. One cafe in the district of Wanchai was daubed with slogans saying \"boycott\", as well as insults to the police and Maxim's Caterers \u2013 the major Hong Kong restaurant chain that runs Starbucks outlets in the city.\n\nThe vandalism illustrates the huge pressures on international brands as Hong Kong is shaken by its worst political unrest in decades.\n\nBeijing is piling pressure on businesses to publicly condemn the protests. Those that do risk a protester backlash, but staying silent risks financial punishment on the mainland \u2013 a far more lucrative market.\n\nElite out of touch\n\nThe boycott campaign against Maxim's snowballed after Annie Wu, the daughter of Maxim's wealthy founder, delivered a speech earlier this month in which she condemned the protests and said Beijing's hardline stance against democracy advocates should be supported.\n\nShe was speaking at the UN's human rights council in Geneva alongside Pansy Ho, a billionaire casino magnate who made similar calls.\n\nTheir comments were seized on by protesters and portrayed as an example of how Hong Kong's wealthy elite are out of touch with public sentiment and in the pockets of Beijing.\n\nProminent democracy campaigner Joshua Wong was among those calling for a boycott of Starbucks, and more than 50 000 people have signed a petition asking the Seattle-headquartered company to sever ties with Maxim's.\n\n\"We herein urge the Board of Directors to consider whether Maxim's truly represents the social values of Starbucks and terminate the franchise to Maxim's immediately,\" Wong wrote on Twitter on Friday.\n\nAsked for comment, Maxim's sent a statement dated September 25, in which it said Wu \"is not employed in any position or capacity at the company\".\n\nCathay Pacific 'purge'\n\nIt also added that it was \"deeply concerned about the safety of our frontline team due to the incidents happen[ing] at our outlets\".\n\nOther major brands have also been rounded on by protesters, either for pro-Beijing comments made by owners or because the owners themselves are linked to the Communist Party in China.\n\nYoshinoya, a popular noodle chain, and Genki Sushi \u2013 also run by Maxim's \u2013 have been repeatedly tagged with graffiti, along with Bank of China branches.\n\nBrands deemed to be sympathetic to protesters have also had a torrid time and faced boycotts on the mainland.\n\nAuthorities in China tore into Cathay Pacific after staff joined protests, forcing the company to go through stricter regulatory checks.\n\nThe moves led to major staff changes on Cathay's board \u2013 including the resignation of its CEO \u2013 as well as multiple staff being fired for expressing pro-democracy sentiments, something some employees have described as a \"purge\".", "description": "Starbucks has emerged as the latest brand to fall foul of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protesters after a family member of the restaurant chain that owns the local franchise spoke out against demonstrators.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9298/01f63ac595f94cd08f0531f122456721.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
