But there\u2019s a deeper and more important point here: The founders wrote the impeachment and removal power into the Constitution at a time when that wasn\u2019t true \u2014 when there was no 12th Amendment, and so it was entirely possible that removing the president from office would hand power over to one of his rivals.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what would have happened, for instance, if the Democratic-Republicans had taken over Congress in the 1798 midterm elections instead of in 1800, and then removed Adams in favor of Jefferson. But even in the face of that possibility, the founders still gave the House the power to impeach and the Senate the power to remove \u2014 because it was more important that the legislature should have a check on the executive.\n\nChecks and balances run in both directions. To that end, the Constitution\u2019s drafters took away the vice president\u2019s power to preside over presidential removal trials in the Senate (and gave it to the chief justice). And although a bare majority of the House has the power to impeach, the founders required a two-thirds vote of the Senate for removal \u2014 to ensure that a geographically representative supermajority agreed with the House\u2019s determination that the president had engaged in misconduct that should disqualify him from office.", "description": "", "authors": ["Stephen Vladeck", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Impeachment-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
