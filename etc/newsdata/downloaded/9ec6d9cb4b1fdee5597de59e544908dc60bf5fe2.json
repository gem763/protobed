As a reminder, bond proxies are relatively safe stock-market sectors that investors look to for income and stability, particularly during times of market volatility and a regime of ultralow government bonds.\n\nBack in July, analysts at Ned Davis Research suggested that market sentiment for bonds and their proxies could soon be expected to reach \u201cextreme optimism\u201d and subsequently turn down sharply.\n\nRead: Are investors about to throw a \u2018bond proxy\u2019 tantrum?\n\nTo be sure, it isn\u2019t entirely clear that investors have reached that point yet, but there are some murmurs: on Monday, BCA Research released a note titled \u201cBond Yields Have Hit Bottom.\u201d\n\nIt is also important to point out that the definition of \u201cbond proxy\u201d can be a bit fuzzy. The Ned Davis researchers flagged utilities and real estate, two of the most traditional categories, back in July. On Monday, the Jefferies team also took note of consumer staples, which also tend to offer dividends and perform better than consumer discretionary companies when the economy turns down.\n\nDespite that, investors may be shying away from staples because they are one of the sectors most vulnerable to trade-war headwinds. Indeed, that category saw the biggest outflow over the past week. Real estate ETF assets ticked up 0.1%, but utilities declined 0.4%.\n\n\u201cWe are in the camp that when the market moves higher, these groups move lower,\u201d the Jefferies analysts said, referring to utilities and staples.\n\nSee: Central bankers now know: hang together or most assuredly hang separately\n\nMeanwhile, enthusiasm for energy assets continues to dwindle: those ETFs lost 1.8% of their assets this past week, and have charted a 22% loss year-to-date. Even though investor appetite has cooled toward utilities and real estate recently, both sectors still benefit from being in favor throughout the course of the year. Utilities and real-estate fund flows are still up 19.9% and 5.8% in the year through September 6, respectively.\n\nFinally, while the moves mentioned above would seem to signal investors have a more bullish outlook, they\u2019re still hedging their bets. Gold ETFs gained 1.3% in flows last week. Low volatility funds gained 0.9%, and are up nearly 50% in the year to date.\n\nIn a note out Monday, DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas also took note of the interest in gold. \u201cAt a net level all of August\u2019s commodity inflows went to (the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, -0.37% ) and the iShares Gold Trust IAU, -0.49% , 2 exchange traded funds which purchase and custody physical gold,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLast month\u2019s fund purchases are the equivalent of 5,800 gold-delivery bars (averaging 400 troy ounces).
