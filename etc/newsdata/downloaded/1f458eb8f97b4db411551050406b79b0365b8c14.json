I\u2019m always searching for new, more sustainable products which will make Christmas sparkle but won\u2019t end up spoiling our environment.\u2019\n\nFor the first time this year, the Selfridges Selection Christmas range, including mince pies and Christmas cake, are now 100 per cent plastic free.\n\nThe plastic used in the packaging of these products in previous years, for example in trays, windows and bags, has this year been replaced with either recyclable card or NatureFlex, which looks and feels like plastic but is actually made from wood pulp and will rot down with food waste.\n\nUnilever, which makes Dove is today announcing a major shift away from plastic that will cut the use of virgin plastic by 20,500 tons a year, which is claimed to be enough to circle the earth 2.7 times.\n\nThe initiative means that from next year, single packs of Dove soap will have the plastic wrapper replaced with a what it says will be a zero plastic material. Other Dove products will move to 100 per cent recycled plastic bottles \u2018where technically feasible\u2019 from the end of this year.\n\nThe company is also looking at a move to refillable and reusable packaging as has already been seen with the launch of stainless steel deodorant sticks.\n\nChief Research & Development officer at Unilever, Richard Slater, said: \u2018Today\u2019s announcements are an important step in our work to transform how we produce, use and dispose of plastic packaging.\n\n'By making this move, we aim to drive the global recycling industry to collect more waste plastic and make more recycled plastic available for use.\u2019\n\nHelen Bird, of the waste advisory group, WRAP, said: \u2018Unilever continue to work at pace on their commitment to eliminate unnecessary plastic, make plastic packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable and increase the use of recycled content, thereby reducing the need for new plastic production.\n\n'Making these initiatives a success also rests with citizens; using refill and concentrate options and also recycling the packaging so that it can be re-manufactured.\n\n'Our research shows that while we are well accustomed to recycling items from the kitchen, there is often valuable plastic packaging missed from the bathroom.\u2019", "description": "John Lewis aims to fight back against plastic waste  by changing packaging around Christmas-themed merchandise.
