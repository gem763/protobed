New initiatives include mental health resources for employees, ride-share options to help workers get home safely and technological developments that will streamline or automate time-consuming tasks like inventory management and scheduling.\n\nA strong, happy workforce \u2013 and effective outreach to the U.S. job candidate pool \u2013 is critical to Starbucks\u2019 plans to open more than 600 net new stores in the Americas in fiscal 2019 alone. The U.S. unemployment held near record lows at just 3.7 percent through August. A longtime leader among coffee chains, Starbucks is facing stiff competition from smaller local chains of high-end coffee shops as well as corporate rivals such as McDonald\u2019s and Dunkin\u2019 Brands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always listened to our partners, so it\u2019s just a chance for us to evolve that. I think it\u2019s really important right now in this competitive environment that we do our very best,\u201d Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Roz Brewer told FOX Business. \u201cWe think we\u2019re known for having great relationships with our partners, but we don\u2019t really want to rest there, because they\u2019re critical to us.\u201d\n\nThe new policies were developed in response to specific feedback Starbucks received from store managers, employees and tech-based monitoring of store inefficiencies. Current plans call for the automation or elimination of 17 hours of tasks. Store managers will no longer have to double-check inventory, coordinate deliveries or set up three weeks of schedules for 25 employees by hand.\n\nConfrontations at the Philadelphia and Tempe stores complicated community outreach efforts and forced the company to rethink employee training. However, company officials say the policy changes are tied to a close study of internal operations that began two years ago.\n\n\u201cThrough strategic, long-term investments in labor hours, training, and streamlining tasks and processes critical to running a store, we will work to alleviate some of the pressure and stress that often limits our store managers to lead and grow,\u201d Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said in a letter to company employees.\n\nA new approach to the mental health crisis is core to the company\u2019s efforts. In Chicago, store managers will take part in training sessions with clinical psychologists to learn \u201cemotional first aid\u201d and other ways of helping their employees. Starbucks is also set to offer subscriptions to mental health app \u201cHeadspace\u201d by January.\n\nMoving forward after Philadelphia, Tempe\n\nThough fostering relations with customers in tight-knit communities has always been core to Starbucks\u2019 business model, company policies have faced unprecedented scrutiny over the last 18 months. The trouble began in May 2018, when two black men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, were arrested at a Starbucks store in Philadelphia after store employees called police because the two men, who were waiting for a friend, had stayed inside without making a purchase.\n\nThe incident sparked a national outcry and led Starbucks to take the unprecedented step of closing all of its more than 8,000 U.S. store locations for employee racial bias and sensitivity training. The sessions lasted for four hours and included 175,000 employees across the country.\n\nIn July, Starbucks drew renewed criticism after an employee in Tempe, Arizona, asked six police officers, some of whom were military veterans, to leave the store. Starbucks issued a formal apology for the action, which executive vice president Rossann Williams called \u201ccompletely unacceptable.\u201d\n\nBrewer said the two incidents served as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for Starbucks executives and informed how the company has trained employees in the days since.\n\n\u201cPart of the work we realized is that our store manager needs to know what community they\u2019re in and how they need to service any issues in those communities \u2013 because those issues come inside the store \u2013 in addition to creating those conversations, going beyond coffee with a cop and engaging the community inside the building,\u201d Brewer said.\n\nStory continues", "description": "New initiatives include mental health resources for employees, ride-share options to help workers get home safely and technological developments that will streamline store operations.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
