Telephone calls to the offices of the top church body, the New Zealand Catholic Bishops' Conference, and the bishop's diocese went unanswered.\n\nDrennan, appointed in 2012 as the bishop of Palmerston North, was born in New Zealand's city of Christchurch in 1960 and ordained a priest in 1996, his biography on the diocese website shows.\n\nIn the statement, Dew said the woman, who wanted the details of her complaint kept private, was told of the resignation and church officials were in contact with her.\n\n\"The Catholic church has no tolerance for any inappropriate behaviour by any of its members,\" the statement cited Dew as saying, adding that he urged anyone who experienced such behaviour to notify the church, police or other authorities.\n\n(Reporting by Lidia Kelly; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)", "description": "A Catholic bishop in New Zealand has resigned after a church body investigated a young woman's complaint against him regarding \"unacceptable behaviour of a sexual nature\", a top church official has said.
