Source: InsiderScore.com\n\nFirst United (FUNC)\n\nDriver Management revealed on Sept. 5 that it holds 360,637 shares of the community bank, equal to nearly 5.1% of the outstanding stock. That figure includes 256,637 shares purchased from July 24 through Aug. 30 at a price range of $19.93 to $21.55 each. Driver disclosed that it intends to \u201cpurchase additional shares, as [it] believes First United represents a very attractive investment opportunity\u2014an opportunity that others seem to have discovered, as well.\u201d\n\nDriver continued that First United \u201clacks scale to justify an elevated expense base\u201d and possess a branch network that has been unable to \u201ccreate sufficient operating leverage due to lackluster organic loan growth.\u201d Driver recommends that a sale to a larger peer would be the best route to enhance shareholder value.\n\nIt believes that such a move would \u201cunlock the value of [First United\u2019s] high-quality deposit franchise and attractive trust and wealth management businesses,\u201d and also lift shareholder value without the \u201crisk and uncertainty\u201d of First United attempting to scale-up its business on its own.\n\n\n\nRed Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB)\n\nVintage Capital disclosed on Sept. 10 that it owned 1,500,000 shares of the small-cap casual-dining chain, or 11.6% of Red Robin\u2019s outstanding stock. In July, Vintage Capital notified the company that it was prepared to offer $40 per Red Robin share in a take-private acquisition, adding that it would seek a special shareholders meeting if Red Robin\u2019s board \u201cfailed to engage\u201d with Vintage regarding its proposal. On Sept. 5, Red Robin\u2019s board announced that it \u201cunanimously rejected\u201d the unsolicited offer, \u201cas the strategic plan currently being implemented by Red Robin positions the company to deliver greater long-term value\u2026than Vintage\u2019s proposal.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 10, Vintage responded by letter that it \u201cintends to investigate\u2026including through a thorough review of the company\u2019s books and records as permitted by applicable law,\u201d because it feels that Red Robin has not been completely forthcoming in its reasons for rejecting the acquisition. Vintage concluded that it will review its \u201coptions as to the replacement of all or a portion\u201d of Red Robin\u2019s board.\n\nOriginal Filings\n\n\n\nAvid Technology (AVID)\n\nImpactive Capital disclosed on Sept. 6 an initial position of 3,665,256 shares of the audio- and video-content maker and distributor. That stake counts 2,528,227 shares purchased at $5.98 to $9.97 each during the period of July 8 through Sept. 6.\n\nImpactive said that it acquired the shares because it was an \u201cattractive investment.\u201d Impactive also revealed on Sept. 6 that it entered a nondisclosure agreement with Avid Technology so the two may discuss various topics, including Avid\u2019s \u201cbusiness, operations, and communications with investors,\u201d inclusive of its preparations for the company\u2019s investor day presentations.\n\nImpactive has no specific plans or proposals at present, and the agreement will terminate no later than Nov. 30.\n\n\n\nCallon Petroleum (CPE)\n\nPaulson disclosed on Sept. 9 a new position in the independent oil-and-gas explorer of 21,593,523 shares, all of which was purchased during the period of July 15 to Aug. 14.\n\nThe stake was acquired at per share prices of $4.12 to $5.73 and gives Paulson a 9.5% interest in the energy firm. On the date of the disclosure, Paulson addressed a letter to Callon Petroleum\u2019s board opposing Callon\u2019s proposed $3.2 billion all-stock acquisition of Carrizo Oil & Gas announced in mid-July. Paulson believes that investors bought Callon\u2019s stock due to its \u201ccommitment to be a pure-play, high quality Permian producer. As such\u2026it has traded at a meaningful premium to those of its multi-basin peers.\u201d\n\nIt added that a combination with Carrizo\u2019s \u201cinferior Eagle Ford assets\u2026would eliminate this pure-play status\u201d and \u201cpermanently discourage potential acquirers of Callon.\u201d\n\nPaulson believes that the proposed premium to be paid to Carrizo is \u201cunwarranted,\u201d and according to the proxy, \u201cno other potential buyer of Carrizo was willing to pay such a premium.\u201d Callon intends to issue \u201can additional 83%\u201d of outstanding stock to close a deal that \u201cwould massively dilute current shareholders.\u201d Because of this and other factors, Paulson will vote its Callon shares against the merger and proposes that a sale of Callon would be much more rewarding for shareholders.\n\nIncreases in Holdings\n\nSunrun (RUN)\n\nTiger Global Management cited a larger position in the solar-energy firm of 26,056,051 shares, equal to 22.2% of the tradable stock, without citing any plans or proposals. The stake includes 2,122,338 shares acquired from Aug. 20 to Sept. 11 at prices of $14.78 to $15.50 each. Tiger Global first disclosed a 7.8% interest in Sunrun in late March 2018, then a 7.8% interest in the firm, and has steadily raised its position to the current level.\n\n\n\nCerecor (CERC)\n\nArmistice Capital disclosed a higher stake in the biopharmaceutical company of 39,368,948 shares. That tally counts 1,200,000 shares bought directly from Cerecor through a Sept. 4 securities purchase agreement at a price of $3.13 each. Armistice now owns 64.3% of the company.\n\nDecreases in Holdings\n\n\n\nBabcock & Wilcox Enterprises (BW)\n\nSteel Partners revealed on Sept. 10 a reduced holding in the power-generation hardware maker after sales on Aug. 28 through Sept. 10. During that span, Steel Partners sold 1,000,000 shares at a price range of $3.70 to $3.90 apiece, lowering its interest in the manufacturer to 7.1%, or 3,280,992 common shares. No reason was given for Steel Partners\u2019 nearly one-quarter cut to its stake.\n\nThe Activist Spotlight\n\nBloomin\u2019 Brands (BLMN)\n\nBusiness: casual restaurants\n\nInvestor\u2019s Average Cost: $16.33\n\nStock Market Value: $1.6 billion ($19.44/share)\n\nWhat\u2019s Happening: Jana Partners intends to discuss with management a potential sale of the company.\n\nKey Numbers:\n\n10%: Bloomin\u2019 Brands Ebitda margin, versus 14% for Darden\n\n6 times: Bloomin\u2019 Brands\u2019 valuation relative to 2020 Ebitda, versus 11 times for Darden\n\n(12.9%), (14.7%), (0.96%): Bloomin\u2019 Brand\u2019s one- three- and five-year stock return, versus 0.73%, 34.3%, and 45.9% for the S&P 500\n\nBehind the Scenes: Jana has had great success in persuading boards to sell consumer businesses such as PetSmart, Safeway, and Whole Foods. Jana had filed a 13D on Bloomin\u2019 in 2017 but sold its position with a 38.9% return after the company made some requested changes. Since then, the stock has significantly underperformed. This is an excellent example of an activist giving a company time to execute its plan and is engaging only because management is unable to do so by itself. Bloomin\u2019 trails its peers in Ebitda margin, Ebit margin, and valuation multiple, resulting in poor stock performance. It has a history of poor capital allocation, repurchasing $35 million of stock in the fourth quarter of 2016 at an average price of $19.27, while its CEO exercised options to sell 250,000 shares at $17.15 per share. Jana will probably push the board to sell to a private-equity buyer who could fix the capital-allocation and margin issues and review the company\u2019s portfolio. If Jana is met with resistance, its history shows that it won\u2019t hesitate to make board nominations at the next annual meeting. The company said it \u201cwill consider all perspectives.\u201d\n\n--Kenneth Squire\n\nThe 13D Activist Fund,a mutual fund run by an affiliate of the author and not connected to Barron\u2019s, has a long position in Bloomin\u2019 Brands.
