When there isn\u2019t enough water, I can\u2019t even make food on time or feed my children,\u201d says Aherwal, 28, who became a Jal Saheli in her village of Agroutha in April.\n\n\u201cThis will help solve our water problem. Our village will be able to drink water. We will get to irrigate our crops again.\u201d\n\nIn earlier times, Bundelkhand, blighted by 13 episodes of drought in the last two decades, received 52 days of rainfall a year. But the number of days has more than halved since 2014, according to Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency.\n\nThat has led to repeated and widespread crop failures in a region that is dependent on agriculture, prompting a growing tide of farmers to migrate to nearby cities.\n\nWomen and children often bear the brunt of water shortages \u2013 from domestic violence as tensions rise in water-short homes to missed school days and child marriage, according to local water conservation experts.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

That\u2019s how bad it was.\u201d\n\nBut things have changed since 2016 after Tara and two other Sahelis talked about the need for water conservation in their village and gathered dozens of people to revive their community pond and wells, and install new hand pumps.\n\nWe see ads on TV that show water flowing from taps, from showers and think \u2018Wow, we should move to the city\u2019. But that is a false dream, at least for people like us who have no money. So it is better to make changes here\n\nNow washing dishes, cooking, mopping, doing the laundry, bathing, farming and taking care of livestock are much easier, says Geeta, another Saheli who goes by one name.\n\n\u201cIf there is water, we have everything and if there is no water, we have nothing,\u201d she says, gesturing to Manpur\u2019s brimming pond where buffaloes wallow to beat the heat.\n\nRural Indian women make good managers and protectors of natural resources, says Reetu Sogani, a researcher on traditional knowledge, gender and climate change.\n\n\u201cBecause they interact so closely with their natural surroundings and they know what kind of problems they face in day-to-day life ... they come up with solutions and adaptation mechanisms based on their knowledge,\u201d she says.\n\nFor many women, it hasn\u2019t been easy to become Jal Sahelis in a male-dominated, conservative region, where age-old customs dictate a woman\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cMy husband got upset and asked \u2018Why are you going out?\u2019 \u2019Where are you roaming around?\u2019 ... \u2018You aren\u2019t even getting paid, what is the point?\u2019,\u201d says Aherwal, who makes up to 6,000 rupees (\u00a370) a month rolling traditional cigarettes at home.\n\n\u201cI endured all his anger, his scoldings to join this group.\u201d\n\nSeveral Sahelis say their husbands and in-laws eased up after noticing the water situation improving \u2013 and the women weren\u2019t cutting corners at home.\n\nAfter their chores and work at home, most women can carve out only two hours a day for their Saheli work, they say.\n\nThat can involve creating a water conservation plan for their village, participating in local council talks, meeting government officials, and learning how to use tools to fix wells and hand pumps \u2013 a chore traditionally done by men.\n\nSanjay Singh, the secretary of Parmarth Samaj Sevi Sansthan, a grassroots charity behind the Jal Saheli programme, says the women are now more involved in household and village decisions, leading to effective change in some places.\n\n\u201cThe index of happiness has increased (in the region),\u201d he says.\n\nBindrawan Lodi, a 60-year-old farmer, agrees. He says without the Sahelis\u2019 push to revive their community pond, his Chaukheda village would have been in \u201ca lot of trouble\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis place was bone dry. Now we have enough water to irrigate our crops. Drinking water is still a struggle ... but this is a start,\u201d he says.\n\nBundelkhand, once a region green with dense forests and fields, is increasingly barren with little groundwater.\n\nThe area\u2019s rocky terrain largely stops rainwater from percolating into aquifers, Singh says. Loss of forests also has hit rainfall, and water reservoirs have sometimes been used wastefully, residents say.\n\nAlthough civil society and government agencies have ramped up water conservation efforts, Singh warns that much more needs to be done before the \u201cdangerous\u201d effects of climate change exacerbate problems of unemployment, malnutrition and migration.\n\nTwo in five people in rural Bundelkhand have become urban migrants over the last decade, according to estimates by activists from the Bundelkhand Water Forum, a coalition of local organisations.\n\nSingh says more private investment, bigger government budgets, work restoring trees and other greenery and climate adaptation techniques, such as growing less water-intensive crops, could help stem the exodus.\n\nThat is one of the reasons the Sahelis say they work so hard. They want to ensure their children can stay put and their daughters or daughters-in-law can live a life free of water worries.\n\n\u201cWe see ads on TV that show water flowing from taps, from showers and think \u2018Wow, we should move to the city\u2019. But that is a false dream, at least for people like us who have no money. So it is better to make changes here,\u201d says Aherwal.\n\n\u201cOur village will become beautiful in the next five years. All you will see is water everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Reuters", "description": "Her face veiled, Kiran Aherwal shovels\u00a0gravel into a broad platter, places\u00a0it on her head, then steps\u00a0off to help construct a new check\u00a0dam in her thirsty village in central India.
