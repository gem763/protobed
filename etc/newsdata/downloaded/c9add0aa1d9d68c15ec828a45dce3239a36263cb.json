I did not carry this burden (my mother spoke English well) but I did become the de facto strongly worded letter-writer, and the one who would manage any bureaucratic nightmares. This was because, even though Mum\u2019s English was great, there was a part she couldn\u2019t quite get \u2013 the bit of the dance that is indirect, where the bad news is obfuscated in politeness: \u201cThank you for your complaint. We are terribly sorry to offer you nothing.\u201d Instead, Mum would tell me what she wanted to happen, and I would begin, \u201cDear Sir, I write to you regarding an urgent matter\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this, because I have started to send my own letters to a friend. I call her my \u201cdoubt proofer\u201d: she removes the parts where I doubt myself. For example, my application to volunteer on an education scheme: \u201cI care passionately about the education outcomes of poorer children,\u201d I began, \u201calthough I have no direct education experience nor children in the age range of the scheme.\u201d\n\nWhen did we lose interest in hobbies? | Coco Khan Read more\n\n\u201cDelete this\u201d came her note, with the second part underlined.\n\nIt makes sense: language reveals us more than we think, and as we are human, that includes our shortcomings. Someone offering to plug that gap is an underrated kindness.\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I\u2019m convinced that every adult needs a second pair of eyes. Those truthful friends are a real gift.", "description": "Language reveals more of us than we think \u2013 including our shortcomings", "authors": ["Coco Khan"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64c29525c44c0260cd906b8908426816380cb2ca/0_173_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1317884225be5d1a8c30b88c1ab7e3cf", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
