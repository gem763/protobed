A dismal 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United before the international break left Solskjaer\u2019s side just two points above the relegation zone.\n\nNevertheless, Solskjaer is understood to retain the full support of the United hierarchy, who believe he is establishing a defined culture at Old Trafford and expected a difficult season regardless.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

First of all, we are an incredible 141-year footballing institution with all that history, all that legacy, all that tradition and that tradition of success. That can never, ever change. We need to keep that protected.\n\n\u201cThen, like other football clubs, our commercial business allows us to reinvest in the football side. It\u2019s how these two interact with each other at Manchester United that results in us having a competitive advantage in this area.\u201d\n\nUnited have traditionally been English football\u2019s most commercially powerful club and that has not changed despite mediocrity on the pitch, but Woodward \u2013 a former investment banker \u2013 has previously been accused of prioritising financial success over football.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is the commercial side is never allowed to take priority over the football side,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a myth that we have non-football people making football decisions, and I think it\u2019s insulting to the brilliant people who work on the football side in this club.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s recruitment process has come under scrutiny in recent years and the club admit it is an area in which they have failed, particularly during Louis van Gaal\u2019s two-year reign, but there is a genuine belief within the club that this has been put right.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve expanded our recruitment department in recent years and we believe this now runs in an efficient and productive way,\u201d Woodward told staff. \u201cPlayer recommendations and decisions are worked on by this department and by the first-team manager and his staff, not by senior management.\n\n\u201cLast season we were the Premier League\u2019s leading club in terms of the most match minutes given to our own academy graduates. We should all be proud that the significant investments we have made in our academy \u2013 spanning recruitment, facilities and analytics \u2013 are now bearing fruit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more we need to do in that but that\u2019s coming in the next few years,\u201d he added. \u201cWe know this is a strong competitive advantage for us and an area that we\u2019ll continue to focus on and invest in. But this remains the heart of the club.\u201d\n\nUnited\u2019s current form is a far cry from the results Solskjaer initially achieved as caretaker manager. After replacing Jose Mourinho on a temporary basis last December, the Norwegian won 14 of his first 17 games in charge. He has won just five of the 23 games since.\n\nClub sources believe the poor start to this season can be put down to missed penalties, unfortunate refereeing decisions and injuries. United hope to pick up only their third league win of the season when unbeaten leaders Liverpool visit Old Trafford on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe middle section of last season, after Ole\u2019s arrival, feels most relevant to what we want to achieve and where we want to be,\u201d Woodward said to staff. \u201cWe saw a team playing fast, fluid football, with a clear representation of the style and philosophy the manager wants.\n\n\u201cOle has also instilled the discipline back into an environment where we may have lacked it in recent years. He is building a squad that respects the club\u2019s history, in which players work hard and respect their team-mates. No-one is bigger than the club.\n\n\u201cThe changes we saw over the summer have resulted in a very young squad. But it\u2019s also a squad, with the players and the culture, that provides a base camp for us to build and grow from as we start our new journey.\u201d", "description": "Ed Woodward, Manchester United\u2019s\u00a0executive vice-chairman, used a recent all-staff meeting to reassure employees that the club is on the right track under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
