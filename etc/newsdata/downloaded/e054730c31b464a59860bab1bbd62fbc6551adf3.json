What is the rubric we are using? A lot of this comes back to building deeply affordable housing.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for homeless people have pushed Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, to adjust his plan to build and preserve 300,000 affordable housing units by including more units to move people out of shelters and off the street.\n\nMr. de Blasio has resisted. Instead, his administration has focused on opening safer shelters with more services, hoping to decrease the homeless population by about 500 people per year.\n\nSo far, the strategy is not working. New York City is scheduled to open 90 shelters by 2022, and should have opened 40 by now. But it has opened only 26, stalled by residents who have banded together to pressure elected officials and even to sue the city. The most vocal objections have been to shelters for single men, whether they are in Maspeth, Queens, or Crown Heights, Brooklyn, or on the so-called Billionaire\u2019s Row in Manhattan. Last week, residents on the Upper West Side of Manhattan protested the city\u2019s decision to turn a women\u2019s shelter into one for men.\n\nSteven Banks, the commissioner of the Department of Social Services, has no direct control over the mayor\u2019s housing plan, but he has tried to manage the homelessness crisis with the shelters, facing angry elected officials and residents at forums. He said the murders were \u201ca heartbreaking reminder of why we do the work we do every day, to help people going through hard times, including those who may be troubled, get the support they need.\u201d\n\nBut the city is hard pressed to find communities that embrace men\u2019s shelters.\n\n\u201cWe see them, but we don\u2019t want to see them,\u201d said Hakki Akdeniz, an advocate for homeless people.\n\nMr. Akdeniz, 39, is the owner of Champion Pizza, a chain of restaurants in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. He sobbed on Saturday, mourning the four deaths . \u201cWe think of homeless people like they are not human,\u201d he said through his tears.", "description": "The brutal killing of four men occurred in a Manhattan neighborhood where the street homeless problem has long persisted.", "authors": ["Nikita Stewart", "Katie Van Syckle", "Ashley Southall"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/nyregion/06homeless3/06homeless3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
