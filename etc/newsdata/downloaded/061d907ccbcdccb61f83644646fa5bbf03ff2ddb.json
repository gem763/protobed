The New York Times reported last year that Trump used a series of dubious tax schemes to shield a $400 million inheritance from the IRS.\n\nAnd in September, Mother Jones published an investigation that found that Trump might have fabricated a loan to avoid paying $50 million in income taxes.\n\nBut Trump has long maintained that he has committed no financial or tax crimes. He has said he can't release his tax returns because they are under audit, even though there is no rule to prevent him from doing so.\n\nBut the president may soon be forced to give his tax returns to investigators. On October 7, US District Judge Victor Marrero ordered Trump to turn over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors investigating whether he violated state laws by fabricating business records.\n\nDays later, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered the president to turn over the past eight years of his tax returns to the House Oversight Committee, saying lawmakers have the right to see the documents.\n\nTrump's lawyers have said they will fight both decisions and take them to the Supreme Court if they have to.\n\nRead more: The floodgates are opening as Trump officials publicly defy his orders and more whistleblowers come out of the shadows\n\nBut the public may still get a window into the president's closely held financial documents thanks to an employee at the IRS who recently blew the whistle on \"inappropriate efforts to influence\" the agency's audit of Trump's tax returns.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the person accused of trying to interfere with the audit is a political appointee at the Treasury Department.\n\nThere aren't many government officials who have access to the president's and vice president's tax documents, Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Justice Department, told Insider.\n\n\"The president's and vice president's tax returns are kept in a top-secret vault,\" Cramer said. \"It's code-word-protected, the whole nine yards, and not just anyone can get in there. There are very few people \u2014 the head of the Treasury, the head of the IRS \u2014 who have access.\"\n\nTrump was also accused of altering his tax and loan records by Michael Cohen, his longtime former lawyer who is serving a three-year federal prison sentence for campaign-finance violations and tax evasion.\n\nIn particular, Cohen accused Trump of inflating and deflating his loan and tax documents, respectively \u2014 an allegation that appears to bear similarities to what ProPublica reported this week.\n\nKevin Riordan, a financing expert and real-estate professor at Montclair State University who reviewed the newly revealed tax records, told ProPublica that \"it really feels like there's two sets of books,\" one for lenders and one for tax investigators.\n\n\"It's hard to argue numbers,\" Riordan said. \"That's black and white.\"", "description": "At least one of the filings that ProPublica obtained was made after President Donald Trump took office in 2017.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da5cdbfcc4a0a32a12a21c9?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
