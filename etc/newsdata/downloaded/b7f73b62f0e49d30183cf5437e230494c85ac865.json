She accidentally put her car in reverse and hit her\n\nAfter the case, the victim's family said: 'Today's verdict gives us the closure we need and allows us to move on, which is what our mum and dad would want for us.\n\n'We would like to thank staff at the RVI for the care and support provided to our mum.\n\n'We would also like to thank Sgt Pinner Rana and his colleagues for their professionalism and tenacity in seeking justice for us today.\n\n'And a special thank you to all our wonderful family and friends who have been there for us during these difficult times.'\n\nIt was on September 18 last year that Tulip pulled up in a Skoda Roomster outside Mrs Nainby's home on Polwarth Crescent, Brunton Park, north Gosforth.\n\nSummarising what happened, Judge Amanda Rippon said: 'She parked the Skoda outside Mrs Nainby's address and they both got out.\n\n'Mrs Tulip believed she had selected park but unintentionally selected reverse gear and failed to apply the handbrake sufficiently.\n\n'The vehicle crept backwards and she re-entered the vehicle and unintentionally pressed the accelerator.\n\nTulip admitted causing death by careless driving at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured)\n\n'This rear movement caused the vehicle to hit Mrs Naiby, it's suggested she was hit by the inside of the door and propelled backwards.'\n\nThe passenger door was not closed properly as another passenger was going to get out of the back, so when the car moved sharply backwards, the door swung open and hit Mrs Nainby, the court heard.\n\nJudge Rippon added: 'Mr Nainby says nothing I can do can help alleviate the pain and suffering they have gone through after this tragic incident.\n\n'I can understand how difficult it's been for the family.\n\n'It's apparent, despite the distress they are going through, they recognised Mrs Tulip as a lifelong friend of their mother and wife and she will no doubt feel the horror of what has happened in an acute way and I'm sure they acknowledge the guilt and horror she will feel.'\n\nTulip, of Seghill, Northumberland, will be sentenced on December 3.\n\nShe has now given up her licence but was given an interim driving ban before being released on bail.", "description": "Patricia Tulip, 82, pulled up outside her lifelong friend Joyce Nainby's home in Gosforth, Newcastle, on September 18 last year.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/12/20129014-0-image-a-46_1571916841033.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
