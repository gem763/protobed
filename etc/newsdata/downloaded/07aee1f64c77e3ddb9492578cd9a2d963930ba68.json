Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC. The funeral home company was sued by the EEOC after they fired a funeral director, Anthony Stephens / Aimee Stephens. The company\u2019s employees, upon commencement of employment, \u201cagree to follow a professional, sex-specific dress code,\u201d their lawyers explain. The dress code is considerate of the delicate needs of grieving families. After about six years of employment as a male funeral director, Stephens informed the company that he is now going to live as a female named Aimee and dress as a female at work. The company carefully considered the impact this would have on their clientele and how Stephens sharing a bathroom with grieving widows would cause them further discomfort. The company asked Stephens to continue dressing like a man and to use men\u2019s bathroom facilities while at work, something he agreed to do when he accepted the terms of employment as a male. Stephens declined to do so and filed a complaint with the EEOC, which then sued the funeral home company for discrimination under Title VII.\n\nThe EEOC is asking the Supreme Court to judicially amend the word \u201csex\u201d to include \u201ctransgender status.\u201d The funeral home company disagrees with this radical redefinition, and asks the Supreme Court to enforce the original congressional definition, which they describe as \u201cbiological sex, something fixed and objectively ascertained based on chromosomes and reproductive anatomy.\u201d\n\nAs of today, 95 amici briefs representing different interest groups have been filed with this case. Amici briefs are legal memoranda to showcase a special-interest position in a case pending before the Supreme Court. Ninety-five is a large number of special interest groups, even by Supreme Court standards.\n\nHeightened interest in the transgender issue is seeping in from leftist and LGBT groups, which have taken the side of the EEOC \u2014 at the expense of women. American females make up 50.8% of our population while transgender individuals make up 0.6%. Typical leftists rushed to support the perceived minority at the expense of the majority in this instance - women.\n\nReal proponents of women\u2019s rights should be very worried. The legal theory peddled by the EEOC will demolish the discrimination protections drafted by Congress to protect women.\n\nAmerican women only obtained the right to vote in 1920. Sex was deemed by Congress as a special, protected class decades later in 1964 due to public recognition of centuries of discrimination against females throughout the globe. Congress sought to even the playing field with Title VII. This protection is now on the line. Why? Because the idea of \u201cgender identity\u201d obliterates the concept of female sex entirely. Female is shifted from objective legal fact to subjective opinion and speculation. If anyone can claim to be a female, then the laws forbidding discrimination against women are rendered entirely meaningless. If anyone can be a woman, then no one is a woman. To embrace \u201cgender identity\u201d necessitates an abolition of special protections for our women and girls.\n\nAt least some women's groups are aptly concerned.\n\nA liberal special interest group, the Women\u2019s Liberation Front, which defines itself as \u201cradical feminists\u201d in its amici brief, is siding with the funeral home company. \u201cLegally redefining \u2018female\u2019 as anyone who claims to be female results in the erasure of female people as a class,\u201d they argue, bringing up many of the same points found in the briefs submitted by Christian Conservative groups, an unusual accord for a feminist group. \u201cIf, as a matter of law, anyone can be a woman, then no one is a woman, and sex-based protections in the law have no meaning whatsoever.\u201d\n\nA conservative female group joined their liberal counterpart in the outrage. The Independent Women's Forum filed a brief discussing the consequences that the Supreme Court's ruling in this case will have on female sports and female athletes. They brought up the biological advantages that males born with an XY chromosome have in sports \u2014 from 36% larger muscle mass to thicker and denser bones to larger lung capacity. Indeed, as we have seen over the past couple of years when biological males decide to \u201ctransition\u201d into females and join female sports, they dominate and win, obliterating their true female competitors.\n\nWillieta Burlette Carter, Professor Emerita of Law The George Washington University Law School, scolded the EEOC on their abandonment of women\u2019s interests, writing in her brief, \u201cEEOC failed to consider the rights of women and girls.\u201d She argued that the EEOC theory of \u201cgender identity\u201d as a protected class under Title VII is simply not supported by substantive law. Her complex legal argument boils down to willing it so, doesn\u2019t make it so.\n\nThe most surprising support for women came from a brief filed by a group of transgendered individuals. They agree that Title VII \u201csex\u201d is grounded in biology, \u201cfixed at conception, and objectively verifiable.\u201d They explain that gender identity issues are within the mind, not the body. They acknowledge a critical point: the belief that one is a woman is not equivalent to being born with XX chromosomes.\n\nDr. Paul R. McHugh, Distinguished Service Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, filed a brief explaining the difference between politics and science in the realm of gender identity. Dr. McHugh\u2019s brief concentrated on the difference between \u201cideological pronouncements\u201d and scientific evidence, concluding that \"sex, from a medical standpoint, does not include gender identity.\u201d Dr. McHugh\u2019s position was echoed in a brief submitted by a group of 50 distinguished professors who called out \u201cgender identity\u201d as \u201cmetaphysical constructs of dubious ideological and political origin.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral argument in October. I, woman, hope that the protections under the law for my gender will not be compromised to appease the left\u2019s political interests du jour.", "description": "The transgender movement is before the Supreme Court of the .09/03/2019 19:38:53PM EST.", "authors": ["Marina Medvin", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/309/35712b8a-9ff8-4ce0-87f7-3099e361bee9.jpg"}
