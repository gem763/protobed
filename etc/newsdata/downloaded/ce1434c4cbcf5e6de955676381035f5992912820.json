REUTERS/Feline Lim/File Photo\n\nChina has repeatedly denied involvement in hacking and neither the foreign ministry nor China\u2019s official cyber regulator responded to requests for comment on the report.\n\nAn Airbus spokesman said the company is \u201caware of cyber events\u201d and like any major high-tech industrial player it is a target for \u201cmalicious acts\u201d.\n\nAirbus \u201ccontinuously monitors\u201d such threats through detection systems and can take \u201cimmediate and appropriate measures to protect itself at all times,\u201d he added.\n\nAirbus said last January that a cyber attack on its systems had resulted in a data breach.\n\nLast year U.S. prosecutors alleged in a court filing that Chinese intelligence officers and hackers had stolen information about a jet engine from an unnamed private company, whose description in court documents matched General Electric-Safran joint-venture CFM, a major supplier to Airbus as well as its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N). CFM has declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the AFP report, which cited multiple unnamed security sources, cyber attacks in the past months on Airbus were mounted via French technology consultancy Expleo, engine maker Rolls Royce (RR.L), and two French Airbus subcontractors which were not identified.\n\nExpleo and Rolls Royce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOver the past 12 months, Airbus has been targeted by four major cyber attacks, AFP cited one of the sources as saying. Some of the attacks date back further, the report said.\n\nThe hackers appeared to have been seeking information about engines for the A400M military transport aircraft and A350 airliner, according to the sources in the report.\n\nThe AFP report did not make clear whether the cyber attacks it described had actually led to data breaches or impacted Airbus operations.\n\nIt said the security sources had not definitively attributed responsibility for the cyber attacks, but that they bore the hallmarks of groups linked to Chinese intelligence.", "description": "A series of cyber attacks on Airbus in the past few months was conducted via the computer systems of its suppliers and security sources suspect a link to China, AFP news agency reported on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434064074&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0HZ", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
