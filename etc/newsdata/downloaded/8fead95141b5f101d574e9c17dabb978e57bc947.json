Because this trio:\n\nPays a 9.3% dividend, on average\u2014with one yielding an incredible 11%. I think you\u2019ll agree that this is a pretty tough return for most \u201creal\u201d landlords to get. Takes zero work\u2014you just buy these property-focused stocks and collect your dividends (and price upside!), and \u2026 Gets you way more diversification than your typical basement apartment, semi-detached or \u201cbox in the sky\u201d condo ever could.\n\nYou may have caught on that I\u2019m talking about real estate investment trusts (REITs).\n\nREITs own a portfolio of properties\u2014everything from cell towers to senior-care centers. There are two reasons why they pay you big dividends, like the 7%+ cash streams we\u2019ll dive into shortly:\n\nREITs are exempt from tax at the corporate level, but \u2026 To keep that tax exemption, they must pay 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends.\n\nPerhaps the biggest advantage REITs have over your typical rental abode is that they can be bought and sold on the open market, like any stock, at your usual trading (typically low, for online brokerages) fee. Rental property, on the other hand, may not sell as fast as you\u2019d like, and closing costs easily run into five figures.\n\nNow let\u2019s dive into the three REITs I have for you today, starting with \u2026\n\nPreferred Apartment Communities (APTS) owns the same kind of real estate most regular folks do. But the scale, of course, is much larger: APTS owns or invests in apartment properties across the south, northeast and eastern seaboard. That gives it diversification your typical individual landlord doesn\u2019t have and helps insulate it from a downturn in any one market.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Preferred Apartment Communities Inc (NYSE: ), which yields 7.4% today, has a long history of outperformance.\n\nChoose Your Index\u2014APTS Beats It\n\nAPTS Beats It Index\n\nAs you can see above, APTS (in orange) has posted a 150.9% total return in the last decade, beating the SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (NYSE: )\u2014in blue\u2014an index fund that passively follows the REIT sector, by a huge margin. But here\u2019s the twist: APTS has also beaten average home-price growth, as measured by the Case-Shiller Home Price Index (in red), by a lot more.\n\nPlus, APTS has its payouts well covered, thanks to a 133.5% dividend-coverage ratio, while income as measured by adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, a better measure for REITs than earnings per share) has been rising, thanks to more tenants and higher rents.\n\nYou can add commercial property to your apartment holdings with a REIT like Tanger Factory Outlet Centers Inc (NYSE: ), landlord to over 2,600 different shops. Tanger has succeeded in avoiding plunging retail sales caused by e-commerce, thanks to its focus on its niche of outlet stores that haven\u2019t faced as much online competition.\n\nTanger\u2019s shares have pulled back in the last couple years, after the company\u2019s massive dividend growth (the payout is up 85% in the past decade) caused investors to get ahead of themselves and give it a huge valuation far above its competitors.\n\nBut today, Tanger is more in tune with the rest of the market, making it worth any income investor\u2019s attention. What\u2019s more, its revenues are still rising, and earnings results (based on FFO) have beaten expectations in 11 out of the last 12 quarters (and met expectations in that 12th quarter).\n\nThe REIT\u2019s dividend now yields 9.4% and is still growing, with the latest hike just this past April. And there\u2019s likely more to come, with Tanger\u2019s dividend-coverage ratio checking in at 180%, a figure far beyond what most REITs can boast.\n\nFinally, you can get deeper into commercial real estate with a REIT like Global Net Lease Inc (NYSE: ), which focuses on industrial and office properties. GNL has geographic diversification in spades, with properties in both the US and Europe.\n\nA Global Real Estate Titan\n\nA Global Real Estate Titan\n\nSource: Global Net Lease\n\nThat diversification is in part behind GNL\u2019s reliable dividend growth from 2015 to now, which is a gift for income investors: the REIT\u2019s yield is now 11%, making it one of the biggest-yielding property REITs in the world.\n\nPut all three of these REITs together and you have a diversified real-estate portfolio covering thousands of properties internationally, with a big average yield of 9.3%. That\u2019s impossible to get renting out a single house or condo\u2014and it comes with far fewer headaches, too.\n\nMy Top REIT Pick Revealed: a Growing 7.4% Dividend (for 11% Off!)\n\nHere\u2019s something that may surprise you: my favorite REIT now isn\u2019t Global Net Lease, Tanger or Preferred Apartment Communities.\n\nIt\u2019s actually a REIT-focused closed-end fund (CEF) that gives us three big benefits no individual REIT can:\n\n\u201c1-click\u201d diversification: My pick\u2019s portfolio is flush with apartment, data-center, senior-care and office REITs from across the US. A rock-steady 7.4% dividend, and \u2026 An 11% discount! Due to a quirk in the CEF structure, this fund actually trades for less than the value of the REITs in its portfolio! At $0.89 on the dollar, this is basically free money.\n\nThat makes this fund the antidote if you feel you\u2019ve missed out on the REIT rally this year. Because even though my pick (in blue below) has crushed the REIT benchmark and the S&P 500 \u2026\n\nNo. 1 REIT Pick Dominates\u2014While Paying 7.4%\n\nNo. 1 REIT Pick Dominates\u2014While Paying 7.4%\n\n\u2026 it\u2019s still a screaming bargain, thanks to that discount between the fund\u2019s price and its \u201ctrue\u201d value (known as the discount to NAV in CEF-speak).\n\nThe bottom line? That massive 34% gain is just Act 1!\n\nThe name of this fund is waiting for you now: just click right here and I\u2019ll set you up with a no-risk 60-day trial to my CEF Insider service.
