You will never breathe free air again. I am genuinely sorry for you. This tragedy touches everyone, even you. What you did was so abhorrent and vile that you must spend the rest of your life in prison, away from the victims, and away from this community that you unspeakably terrorized.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

He pleaded guilty to aggravated murder and child kidnapping, among other charges.\n\nAt Whipple\u2019s sentencing, several family members talked about Lizzy\u2019s love of nature and the \u201ccolors of the rainbow,\u201d according to the report.\n\nLizzy\u2019s mother Jessica Black, who is Whipple\u2019s sister, did not attend the sentencing. Instead, she gave a brief statement outside the courthouse.\n\n\u201cFor our family, our lives will never be the same,\u201d said Black. \u201cWe will never forget our sweet girl and the happiness and the sunshine she brought us. Staying in the present and remembering Lizzy\u2019s love is what I\u2019m trying hard to do each day. Every day is a process of surviving and not getting overwhelmed by my memories.\u201d\n\nAn attempt to reach Whipple\u2019s public defender was unsuccessful.", "description": "Utah Man Who Killed 5-Year-Old Niece Sentenced to Life in Prison", "authors": ["Elaine Aradillas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5L5YXDbxOydjGQhMsUVJwA--~B/aD0yNjk0O3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/ece13920ad2860ba88736213968c2087", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
