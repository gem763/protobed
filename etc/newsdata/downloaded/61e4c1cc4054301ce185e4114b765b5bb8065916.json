Strategy", "language": "en", "text": "VandeHei\u2019s theory that \u201cCEOs are America\u2019s new politicians\u201d rests on the fact that corporate leaders now wade into politics more than they used to. Marking the recent retreat from \u201cshareholder value theory\u201d\u2014the notion, which has dominated corporate America for the past several decades, that a corporation\u2019s only responsibility is to increase shareholders\u2019 profits\u2014VandeHei wrote last month that corporate leaders have \u201cexpanded their mission beyond mere wealth creation to include everything from taking care of employees to helping their communities.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut VandeHei\u2019s supporting evidence undercuts his argument. The increasingly political behavior of corporate America, he wrote, is driven by several trends: Younger employees want to work for companies that share their values. Consumers are increasingly making purchasing decisions based on brand identity and values. The politicization of everyday life puts media pressure on companies to take social stands, at the same time that Washington is paralyzed by hyperpartisanship and unable to pass meaningful gun regulations that force companies\u2019 hands. In this environment, VandeHei writes, \u201ceven the most press-shy, introverted CEOs need to be de facto politicians.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis is not the break from shareholder value theory that VandeHei thinks it is. These companies are not making these decisions to fill a vacuum left by politicians; they\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s good for business. As Axios reported on Thursday, \u201cThe majority of U.S. adults in a new poll by Edelman Intelligence would feel more favorably toward a company whose CEO backs tougher background checks for gun purchases.\u201d Similarly, attracting top talent requires this kind of branding jujitsu. Companies must align with the values of their employees\u2014but not go so far as to alienate their consumers.\n\n\n\nWhile companies are becoming more outwardly political, the idea that they\u2019re doing the work of politicians is seriously exaggerated. Walmart is a perfect case in point. The company, once the most hated retailer in America, has been engaged in a decades-long rebranding project. It\u2019s now trying to take advantage of Amazon\u2019s emergence as the black hat of American capitalism. \u201cOut of sheer necessity to survive the Amazon juggernaut\u2019s retail onslaught, [Walmart] is casting itself as the foil,\u201d Axios\u2019 Erica Pandey reported earlier this year, adding that, with some 4,700 stores, \u201cWalmart is perhaps better positioned than any government agency, think tank or company to take the economic pulse of the U.S. It is using that on-the-ground presence to position itself as a champion of distressed and alienated America.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s possible, I suppose, that Walmart\u2019s McMillon will become the kind of social justice warrior that Carlson fears. But it\u2019s more likely that he is trying to tactically exit the gun debate rather than lead it. The controversy around gun control\u2014and the rise in mass shootings, one of which happened in a Walmart store only weeks ago\u2014is a growing threat to Walmart\u2019s business and its branding as the community-grounded corporation with a heart, in contrast to Jeff Bezos\u2019s soulless behemoth in the sky. Like any smart communications expert, McMillion is getting ahead of the story of Walmart\u2019s role in the gun economy, lest he lose control of it. Over the last few years, the company has stopped selling assault-style rifles, then raised the age to purchase guns to 21, and will now limit ammunition and handgun sales. It has done so without damaging its brand or its stock price\u2014or leading any action on gun control.\n\n", "description": "The company doesn't want to lead the gun debate.
