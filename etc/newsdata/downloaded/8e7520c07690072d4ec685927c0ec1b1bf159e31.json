It\u2019s a major shift in U.S. policy.\n\nThe American withdrawal came just hours after the White House said U.S. forces in northeastern Syria will move aside and clear the way for an expected Turkish assault \u2014 essentially abandoning Kurdish fighters who fought alongside American forces in the yearslong battle to defeat the Islamic State group.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened for months to launch the military operation across the border. He views the Syria Kurdish forces as a threat to his country as Ankara has struggled with a Kurdish insurgency within Turkey.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

IS sleeper cells are already plotting to break free some 12,000 militants detained by Syrian Kurdish fighters in northeastern Syria in a \u201cthreat to local & international security.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish fighters also control the al-Hol camp, home to more than 70,000 mostly wives and children of IS fighters.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted that since the beginning of the crisis in Syria, \u201cwe have supported the territorial integrity of this country, and we will continue to support it.\u201d\n\nHe added that Ankara is determined to ensure the survival and security of Turkey \u201cby clearing the region from terrorists. We will contribute to peace, peace and stability in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe Kurdish Hawar news agency and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also say American troops were evacuating positions near the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad on Monday.\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writer Suzan Fraser contributed to this report from Ankara, Turkey.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces in Syria say American troops have begun withdrawing from areas along Turkey's border.", "authors": ["Bassem Mroue"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ap19271508582118.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C0px%2C8256px%2C4322px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
