The comments came after a quarter of Libra's initial members, including major payments firms Visa and Mastercard, abandoned the project.\n\nLibra is a so-called stablecoin, differing from most other cryptocurrencies in that it will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities.\n\nThe structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.
