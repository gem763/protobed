Drone strikes attacked a oil processing facility at Abqaiq and the nearby Khurais oil field on Saturday, knocking out 5.7 million barrels of daily crude production \u2014 or 50% of the kingdom's oil output. That's more than 5% of global daily oil production. The country's national oil company, Saudi Aramco, has 35-40 days of supply to meet contractual obligations, according to a source close to the matter.\n\nThis attack has material implications for the oil market, as a loss of 5 million barrels per day of supplies from Saudi Arabia cannot be met for long by existing inventories and the limited spare capacity of the other OPEC+ group members. Alan Gelder Wood Mackenzie\n\nSaudi Aramco reportedly aims to restore about a third of its output, or two million barrels, by Monday. \"This heightens the risk premium, it puts a lot of pressure on the supply side,\" said Sarah Cottle, global head of market insight at S&P Global Platts. \"This incident effectively eliminates the world's spare capacity,\" Cottle told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday, though she added the longer-term outlook is bullish due to the immediate need to draw down on crude stockpiles. International benchmark Brent crude oil price spiked by as much as 19% on Monday to $71.95 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) jumped more than 15% to a session high of $63.34 a barrel, before gains were pared later. Brent crude was up 10.7% at $66.67 a barrel, while WTI was up 9.6% at $60.12 a barrel at 10:27 a.m. HK/SIN.\n\n'Geopolitical risk premium' for oil markets\n\nCottle's view was also borne out by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. \"This attack has material implications for the oil market, as a loss of 5 million barrels per day of supplies from Saudi Arabia cannot be met for long by existing inventories and the limited spare capacity of the other OPEC+ group members,\" wrote Alan Gelder, vice president for refining, chemicals and oil markets at Wood Mackenzie. \"A geopolitical risk premium will return to the oil price,\" Gelder said, in a note on Monday. Prior to the weekend attack, oil prices were weighed by supply surplus as well as slowing global growth concerns amid the U.S.-China trade dispute. Just last week, both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the International Energy Agency this week said oil markets could end up with a surplus in 2020, despite an agreement by OPEC and its allies to limit supplies.", "description": "Saudi Aramco has 35-40 days of supply to meet contractual obligations, a source close to the matter told CNBC.", "authors": ["Huileng Tan"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106130880-1568603956259gettyimages-1168032876.jpeg?v=1568604065", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
