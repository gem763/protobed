But Samsung has confirmed that the project isn\u2019t canceled. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to refine and enhance the Galaxy Home prior to launch, and look forward to sharing more with Galaxy fans soon,\u201d a spokesperson told The Verge by email.\n\nThe company had initially aimed to ship the Galaxy Home in April. That didn\u2019t happen, and Samsung\u2019s latest stated goal was sometime in the third quarter of 2019. FCC filings have also revealed a second, considerably smaller Galaxy Home speaker that the company hasn\u2019t yet even formally announced.\n\nSamsung has said the Galaxy Home outputs 360-degree sound and is tuned by the company\u2019s AKG division. It runs the Bixby voice assistant \u2014 Samsung\u2019s alternative to Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri \u2014 and can serve as a hub for smart home gadgets that connect to Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform.\n\nBut clearly the company has run into signifiant challenges during the development process: it shouldn't take this long to ship a speaker, and the Home\u2019s absence at yesterday\u2019s keynote was glaring. We\u2019re reaching the point where the Galaxy Home is starting to give off AirPower vibes. Apple announced AirPower before fully understanding how difficult it would be to make. The circumstances here are much different, but Samsung faces strong and well-established competition in the smart speaker category from Amazon, Google, Sonos, Apple, and others. We still have no idea how Bixby will fare in this setting compared to how it performs on Samsung\u2019s phones.\n\nSamsung has yet to reveal what the Galaxy Home will cost when it eventually does make it to retail shelves.", "description": "It\u2019s been a year since Samsung announced its Galaxy Home smart speaker with Bixby on board.
