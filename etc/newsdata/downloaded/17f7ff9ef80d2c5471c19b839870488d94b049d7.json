This would be an extraordinary remedy of last resort, not first resort,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut if the President is essentially withholding military aid at the same time that he is trying to browbeat a foreign leader into doing something illicit that is providing dirt on his opponent during a presidential campaign, then that may be the only remedy that is coequal to the evil that that conduct represents.\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cWe very well may have crossed the Rubicon here.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s comments are particularly striking given his previous unwillingness to call for impeachment. He came to Congress about 20 years ago in part because his predecessor, former Republican congressman James E. Rogan, voted to impeach President Bill Clinton. Schiff defeated him.\n\nSchiff is also a close ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has been an impeachment skeptic and put the House on a path of turning to the courts to enforce subpoenas that the administration has ignored.\n\nYet, on Sunday, Schiff appeared to suggest Pelosi\u2019s impulse to look to the courts would not do in this instance. The inspector general of the intelligence community has deemed the whistleblower allegation to be \u201curgent,\u201d which, under law, should have triggered the administration to turn it over to Congress.\n\nThe administration refused.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to play rope-a-dope in the court for weeks or months on end,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need an answer. If there\u2019s a fire burning, it needs to be put out. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to have to look at every remedy. . . . We\u2019re going to have to consider impeachment, as well, as remedy here.\u201d", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee chairman, who has long been cautious of impeachment, says Trump\u2019s pressure on Ukraine may force the House to vote to oust him.", "authors": ["Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BFKGP5W5KMI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
