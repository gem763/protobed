But why should we focus on weapons of war, asks Columbine survivor Evan Todd, when they\u2019re responsible for only a fraction of all gun violence? The Columbine massacre itself wasn\u2019t carried out with assault rifles, he notes. Ed sent me a spreadsheet in which he ran through the FBI\u2019s most recent statistics for murder by firearms and found 10,982 in total in 2017, of which exactly 403 were committed with rifles \u2014 a rate of 3.67 percent. There were many more murders committed by \u201cunknown firearms\u201d but even assuming (falsely) that every last one was committed with an assault rifle, that would still put the total of murders by rifle at just a third or so of all firearms murders.\n\nThe realistic best-case scenario if Beto\u2019s mandatory buyback plan were implemented, then, is that mass shootings would become marginally less lethal and *possibly* marginally less frequent. Lunatics would still strike but would be relegated to less powerful weapons, like semiautomatic handguns. Maybe a few would be deterred altogether by being unable to fulfill their \u201csoldier\u201d fantasy in precisely the way they imagined, wielding a weapon that resembles a machine gun. But certainly the massacres will go on, facilitated by weapons like semiautomatic pistols that allow for rapid fire and fast reloading.\n\nSo what then? President Beto throws up his hands and admits defeat? Of course he\u2019d have to target all semiautomatics. The fact that he can\u2019t explain why he\u2019s drawing the line arbitrarily at \u201cweapons of war\u201d is proof that, for all his bravado about refusing to accept the political status quo any longer, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s making a political calculation here. He\u2019s not going to get 100 million semiautomatic handguns confiscated, and he knows that it\u2019d be even more of a political catastrophe to make that demand than calling for confiscation of assault weapons is. He\u2019s focusing on assault weapons because they\u2019re the weapon of choice in mass shootings but obviously not the only weapon capable of carrying out a mass shooting. And rank-and-file Democrats understand that: Remember, last year after the Parkland shooting one poll showed 82 percent support within the party for banning all semiautomatic weapons, not just rifles. That\u2019s the position you\u2019re forced to take if, like Todd, you\u2019re concerned about gun violence broadly, not with making symbolic gestures a la O\u2019Rourke.\n\nBeto\u2019s caught and he knows it. Which explains why, as you\u2019ll see, he felt obliged to tell reporters afterward that he\u2019s open to any and all ideas, including Todd\u2019s, on how to reduce gun violence. Two days ago he assured CNN that he was after assault rifles and only assault rifles. Two days later, after a single difficult question, everything\u2019s on the table.\n\nAnd there was this emotional moment. A Columbine survivor, Evan Todd, asked Beto to include all semi-automatic weapons in his proposed ban. \"I was the first student that was shot in the library. And I was the last one to talk to the two murderers before they committed suicide.\" pic.twitter.com/wygPs1pn5h \u2014 Jeffrey Cook (@JeffreyCook) September 20, 2019\n\nTonight, a man shot at Columbine HS asked @BetoORourke why he isn't calling for a ban on ALL semiautomatic weapons. Beto offered this to reporters: \"If there's a way to improve what we've proposed, I want to make sure we're reflecting that.\" pic.twitter.com/VIR8eWMz5h \u2014 Ryan Haarer (@RyanHaarer) September 20, 2019\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with another short clip of a confrontation he had yesterday in lieu of an exit question. It\u2019s amazing to me that, on top of wrecking his chances for statewide office in Texas with this ploy, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s now also seizing the opportunity presented by this campaign to make enemies of the Democratic leadership. Is he trying to end his political career?", "description": "\"If there's a way to improve what we've proposed, I want to make sure we're reflecting that.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/b-15.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
