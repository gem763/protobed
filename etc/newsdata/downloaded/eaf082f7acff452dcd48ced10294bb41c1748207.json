(AP) - Jalen Ramsey\u2019s three-plus seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars have been far from smooth.\n\nBetween fighting, trash-talking, getting ejected, being suspended, questioning coaches, ripping quarterbacks and requesting a trade, Ramsey has crammed a career\u2019s worth of chaos into 51 games.\n\nSkipping practice this week - for several reasons - hardly created a stir in Jacksonville\u2019s locker room. Teammates, coaches and others inside the football facility have learned to endure Ramsey\u2019s antics.\n\nThe Jaguars (1-2) also seem to be doing everything possible to appease their disgruntled star. They believe he\u2019s worth the headaches, although they have just a 19-32 record during the two-time Pro Bowler\u2019s tenure.\n\nRamsey hasn\u2019t missed a start in his professional career. The Jaguars hope the streak continues Sunday at Denver (0-3). Either way, it will be the next bullet point in Ramsey\u2019s roller-coaster resume.\n\nHere\u2019s a look:\n\n-April 28, 2016: Jacksonville selects Ramsey fifth overall in the NFL draft.\n\n-Sept. 25, 2016: Ramsey rips Baltimore receiver Steve Smith after Jacksonville\u2019s 19-17 victory, calls him an old man and says he has no respect for the future Hall of Famer.\n\n-Oct. 16, 2016: Ramsey holds Chicago\u2019s Alshon Jeffery to one catch for 3 yards in the second half and knocks down Brian Hoyer\u2019s fourth-down pass to Jeffery to seal a 17-16 win.\n\n-Oct. 23, 2016: Ramsey gets ejected late in the fourth quarter of a loss to Oakland after scuffling with receiver Johnny Holton.\n\n-Nov. 20, 2016: TV cameras catch Ramsey crying on the sideline and saying \u201cI\u2019m tired of losing\u201d late in a loss at Detroit.\n\n-Dec. 18, 2016: Ramsey has the best game of his rookie season, holding DeAndre Hopkins to eight catches on 17 targets and recording his first interception in a 21-20 loss at Houston.

He calls Buffalo\u2019s Josh Allen trash, says Atlanta\u2019s Matt Ryan is overrated and adds that Pittsburgh\u2019s Ben Roethlisberger is \u201cdecent at best.\u201d He also compliments others, including Houston\u2019s Deshaun Watson and New Orleans\u2019 Drew Brees.\n\n-Sept. 13, 2018: Ramsey says he definitely would hit his grandmother if she lined up against him on the football field.\n\n-Nov. 11, 2018: Ramsey is responsible for three coverage busts, two of which result in touchdowns, in a 29-26 loss at Indianapolis.
