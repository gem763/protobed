He later passed out on the couch after drinking beer. As Gonzalez slept, Virgilio walked a quarter-mile to the nearest gas station.\n\nShe returned and doused the couch Gonzalez slept on with gasoline, as well as the carpet and the area in front of the apartment\u2019s only exit. Virgilio then lit mail on fire and tossed it on the gas \u2013 shutting the door on Gonzalez as she saw him get up and yell \u2018hot, hot!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Virgilio was sentenced, she told the judge that mental illness and heavy drug use drove her to kill her boyfriend, saying: \u2018I hate me for what I did.

He sentenced Virgilio to 99 years with 39 years suspended, meaning she will likely spend 60 years in jail. She was also sentenced to ten years of probation after her release.", "description": "Gina Virgilio, 32, buried her face into her hands as the judge announced her sentence for the death of Michael Gonzalez in Anchorage, Alaska", "authors": ["Jacob Geanous"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/comp-1571147320_1571148409.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
