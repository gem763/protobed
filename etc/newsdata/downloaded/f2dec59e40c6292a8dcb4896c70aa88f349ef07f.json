Boone Pickens", "language": "en", "text": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I used to tell people that I was in the room when the 1980s \u2013 the bull-market-greed-is-good \u201880s \u2013 began. It was June 1982, and the room was a luxe Waldorf Towers suite leased by Lazard Freres. An investment banker at the firm had loaned the suite to a Texas oilman named T. Boone Pickens Jr., the founder and chief executive of Mesa Petroleum, based in Amarillo, Texas.\n\nBoone, who had a big reputation in Texas, and virtually no reputation outside it, was making an audacious play: He was trying to take over Cities Service, a company ten times Mesa\u2019s size. And I was sitting right next to him, watching him try.\n\nI had just turned 30, a new staff writer at Texas Monthly. Boone was 54. Profiling him was my first assignment, even though I knew nothing about business. Then again, he didn\u2019t know much about hostile takeovers. One thing I understand now is that he and his team \u2013 which included a very young Hamilton James, who went on to become a senior executive at the Blackstone Group Inc. \u2013 were improvising, every step of the way.\n\nOf course, back then you could count on one hand the people who knew how to do a hostile takeover. It was all new \u2013 and corporate America wasn\u2019t happy about it. Men like Boone weren\u2019t called \u201cshareholder activists;\u201d they were called \u201ccorporate raiders\u201d or \u201cgreenmailers.\u201d There were investment banks (Goldman Sachs was one, as I recall) that refused to advise anyone attempting a hostile takeover. Chief executives wouldn\u2019t dream of trying to buy a company that didn\u2019t want to be bought \u2013 if for no other reason than it was impolite. The price of the stock was low on their list of priorities.\n\nWhat I wind up reflecting on now, as I think about Boone, who died on Wednesday at the age of 91, is the role he played in the revolution that has taken place in the way companies think and operate. Michael Jensen, a finance professor at the University of Rochester, is usually given credit for laying the foundation for the modern emphasis on shareholder value. But few people in the executive suites or on Wall Street knew who Jensen was.\n\nThey knew who Boone was, though. He -- and Carl Icahn, and a small handful of others -- loudly proclaimed that everything they were doing was in the interest of shareholders. It was the rationale for their raids. Boone used to lecture me back then: Joe, he\u2019d say, CEOs don\u2019t own the company. The shareholders do. People used to ask me whether this was just something he said to justify his takeover plays. No, I would reply, he really means it.\n\nBoone made five hostile takeovers in the 1980s. He didn\u2019t land any of his targets, but he did become a public figure. When he went after Gulf Oil in 1984, he received the first-ever \u201chighly confident\u201d letter from Michael Milken (meaning that Milken would be able to raise enough in junk bonds to pay for the deal). That same deal also got him on the cover of Time magazine, with an illustration showing him playing high stakes poker. Thus did he help usher in another facet of modern business: the risk-taking, swashbuckling, larger-than-life businessman. It\u2019s not too much to say that Elon Musk is an heir.\n\nFor the next 20 years \u2013 and I can also see this more clearly than I could at the time \u2013 Boone struggled. He started a shareholder rights organization, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere. He had a tight-knit group of young whipper-snappers who had worked on his deals, but one by one, they left. He got into petty feuds with various people in Amarillo, including the editor of the newspaper. At one point, he had the idea of selling rights to the water under his ranch to Dallas or San Antonio. He was damned if he was going to sell it to Amarillo.\n\nBy the mid-1990s, he was in the middle of a horrific divorce and was suffering from depression. Mesa had been borrowing money to pay to shareholders \u2013 he wanted to show that he put his money where his mouth was \u2013 but the company was going broke. Richard Rainwater and his wife, Darla Moore, made a deal to restructure the company. They did, and then \u2013 much to Boone\u2019s surprise -- they tossed him out.\n\nWhat followed was what I think of as the most astonishing part of his career. In 1997, Boone set up shop in Dallas and started an energy hedge fund. He raised $27 million from friends in Texas, and put in another $10 million of his own money. By the end of 1999, the fund had dwindled to $4.4 million.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- I used to tell people that I was in the room when the 1980s \u2013 the bull-market-greed-is-good \u201880s \u2013 began.
