We are requesting that communities please check the credentials of any person who comes to their door.\n\n\"Owing to the nature of surveys we conduct, Stats SA continuously engages with communities. We value and understand the importance of trust between the organisation and the communities we collect data from.\"\n\nAccording to Stats SA, people who work at the institution have branded identity cards and field gear.\n\nWhere possible, vehicles are also visibly branded.\n\nThe mini-census tests will be conducted from October 9 to November 6 across South Africa's nine provinces to prepare for the upcoming census in 2021.\n\nStats SA will test and review census data collection tools and systems as well as operational methodologies.", "description": "Stats SA has asked community members not to jump to conclusions while their staff conduct mini-census field work, following a threat to one of their staffers who was accused of child trafficking when speaking to a minor in Langa, Cape Town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9300/87246692b9754affbf2900551a25045e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
