The time for timorous souls to remain timid, equivocal or fear criticism from ill-informed/motivated quarters that a Congressman is criticizing his party, should cease to be a deterrent, if indeed the good and well being of the Party is in their hearts. It is in this spirit that I embark on the hazardous task of itemizing my wish list for reform to regain the effulgence and legacy of this Party.\n\nFirstly, Congress has to remind itself of its core values and rededicate themselves to them each day. These are of a left of centre, semi-socialist and liberal party. Inclusiveness, celebration of pluralism (secularism having been abused by all ends of the political spectrum), the accommodation of diverse, even contradictory viewpoints, are all part of that core, with radical reformist approaches to social issues sitting harmoniously with seemingly centrist or even rightist emphasis on economic issues, if it is necessary for rapid national development. But all this has to be effectively communicated across India as the true identity of this party and repeated ad nauseam to embed it in the national psyche.\n\nSecondly, Congress must ruthlessly apply only two criteria for most, if not all appointments. One, what the entrant brings to the table by way of political \u201cPakad\u201d, real grassroots ability to galvanize the electorate into a cohesive movement. Second, Organisational or professional or advisory or technocratic talent of a high order, coupled cumulatively with high peer and societal respect. These have to be applied unemotionally without fear or favour, without personal predilection, affection, malice or ill will. In a word, act purely on the merit of these twin criteria.\n\nApplying this test, I would be less than candid if I did not say that large parts of the CWC and of the list of general secretaries deserve radical overhaul. The days of purely geographical or caste considerations in a mega sense, without reference to what the individual, albeit within that rubric, brings to the table, are long over. India\u2019s new demographic profile looks far more to the merit test qua these two criteria than the old \u201cassociational or connection\u201d test. Many of the \u201cglorious anonymities\u201d who have willy nilly found their way into these bodies with monotonous rotational regularity must be immediately replaced by those who satisfy this disjunctive two-fold test.\n\nThird, we have to take a decision NOW, not near the next Parliamentary election, as to in which states we intend to coalesce and where we intend to practice \u2018ekla chalo\u2019, as far as Parliament is concerned. A similar but totally separate state by state decision must be taken qua state elections, years before those elections.\n\nFourth, once we are done with the latter, we must select TWO individuals in each state, after thorough, painstaking and ruthless merit-based research ( for at least 3 months by a genuinely independent panel) to be the Congress mascot in each of those states for the next five years. They must be good orators, in Hindi and/or in the regional language and, once selected, must be backed to the hilt by the party, despite the inevitable cacophony of detractors ( old guard or younger whippersnappers) who exist in all parties and see themselves as endangered species.\n\nFifth, choose the issue of your attack carefully and wisely and then go vertically to the hilt in your attack on the ruling party. Attack, as far as possible, the issue and not the person. Many issues are meant to be ignored, a few even to be appreciated/ endorsed but the ones you choose to attack must be planned meticulously and executed faultlessly. The latter includes a press blitzkrieg, followed by urban-based smaller movements followed by street-level abhiyans, relentlessly implemented without exhaustion or ennui. Most importantly, without zig-zags and frequent course corrections. Such comprehensiveness is frequently lacking.\n\nSixth, all-pervasive over all the above is the need for discipline and unity. I have publicly appreciated the ruling party for sticking to a norm they make and ensuring that even giants like Advani, Joshi, Shanta Kumar (and more recently the respected and amiable Sumitra Mahajan), along with many others, gracefully retire into the sunset. I am by no means advocating a 75 years Margdarshak Mandal\u2014 the point I am making is a much more basic one viz of sticking to a norm without deviation and irrespective of personality.\n\nSeventh, inevitably with Congress\u2019s supremacy in the national polity for decades, a lot of leaders ( genuine and so-called) carry a lot of baggage. Frequently, much of it is uncomplimentary, whether in terms of probity, governance, efficiency, talent or lack of leadership potential. It has to be the top leadership\u2019s headache to sift the grain from the chaff and ensure that such baggage is minimised or redeployed where it can cause the least damage. Relatively cleaner, non-baggage leaders are the need of the hour.\n\nEighthly, and more contemporaneously, the only way to arrest the present drift is to have, not later than 8 weeks after completion of the forthcoming Assembly elections, a full-fledged genuine and comprehensive internal Congress election for the President, CWC and all posts at the apex level. May the best man/ woman win. Only such an election will lend legitimacy to the elected and strength and vitality to the party to restart with renewed vigour the task of nation-building.", "description": "To the several cynics, doomsdayers and opponents, who would like to sing a requiem for the Congress Party, the Grand Old Party of India just might give a wry smile and a wink and say...", "authors": ["Dr Abhishek Manu Singhvi"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/singhvi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
