He also faced a November deadline to report in order to accrue a season of service and gain his free-agent eligibility next offseason.\n\nWith the success of the running game in Los Angeles, the return of Gordon to the lineup will prove an ultimate luxury for the Chargers.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Melvin Gordon is reportedly ending his holdout with the Chargers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ApGYNB576E2Hzs3BnJTsZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cH7VgoUlriBY3_Qb1.hCBw--~B/aD0yNjU0O3c9Mzk4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/7f4d9b70-dfe8-11e9-aadf-dc749f4ddeb2", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
