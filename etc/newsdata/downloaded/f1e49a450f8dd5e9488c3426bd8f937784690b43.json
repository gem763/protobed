REUTERS/Danish Ismail\n\nInvolving some 3.5 million people, apples are the core of Indian Kashmir\u2019s economy, which went into a tailspin after phone and internet links were suspended and hundreds of people detained to prevent anti-India protests from erupting in the streets.\n\nThousands of trucks were lined up on the main highway connecting Kashmir, a Muslim-majority territory claimed in whole by India and Pakistan and ruled in part by both, to the rest of India on Thursday, signalling a recovery in the trade half-way through the harvest.\n\nBeginning Monday, more than 12,000 trucks left Kashmir, bringing the total amount of apples shipped out of the region this year to nearly 0.7 million metric tonnes, compared to 1 million at this point last year.\n\n\u201cThe exports are already picking up,\u201d said Ghulam Mohammad Dar, an official from Kashmir\u2019s horticulture department, adding that he expects the industry to ship out more than last year\u2019s total figure of 2.2 million metric tonnes.\n\nSome mobile connections have been restored and restrictions on movement eased, allowing traders to engage with buyers outside the state. The internet remains suspended in Kashmir for fear it could be used to stir up protests.\n\nKashmir\u2019s apple industry initially came to a near-complete standstill as traders and fruit pickers were stuck in their homes because of strict movement curbs and the apples were left unpicked in orchards.\n\nTraders have been undeterred by a slight spike in attacks by militants on people involved in the apple industry. Since Monday, suspected militants have killed a truck driver transporting apples and two traders, all of them non-Kashmiris.\n\nTRANSPORT TROUBLE\n\nMohammed Amin, the president of the Fruit Growers\u2019 and Dealers\u2019 Association of Shopian, said freight costs could rise following the attacks.\n\nSome traders are already paying double the normal rate to move their apples and it keeps going up, they said.\n\n\u201cWe are sending apple to outside markets but we are suffering huge losses,\u201d said Fayaz Ahmad Malik, who is based in Sopore in northern Kashmir.\n\nApple growers and traders, though, have shunned a federal government plan to directly buy 1.2 million metric tonnes, saying the prices offered were low.\n\nSince Sept. 16, the government has only bought about 1,600 metric tonnes, shipped out on 70 trucks, according to official data reviewed by Reuters.\n\nAn official from the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India, which has been tasked with buying the government\u2019s share of Kashmiri apples, said the agency was unlikely to buy more than half its initial target.", "description": "More than 10,000 trucks laden with apples left Indian-ruled Kashmir this week in a sign that the territory is returning to normal, according to officials and government data, after India imposed a clampdown on the region in August.", "authors": ["Fayaz Bukhari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191018&t=2&i=1442299087&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9H1BV", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
