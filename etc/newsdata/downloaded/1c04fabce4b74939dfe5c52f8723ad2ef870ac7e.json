This marks a massive rise from yesterday, when the currency was trading for just under $8,200, and a $300+ spike is being welcomed by enthusiasts everywhere.\n\nBitcoin Jump Is the First in Some Time\n\nRoughly two weeks ago, bitcoin and its altcoin cousins suffered from what was arguably one of the worst bloodbaths in some time. The negativity doesn\u2019t stem from how much bitcoin lost necessarily, but rather in how quickly it depleted in value. The currency dropped by over $1,400 in just a matter of minutes, falling from around $9,500 per unit to just over $8,100. There was no explanation regarding why the currency was falling, though at the time, Bakkt \u2013 the crypto trading platform designed for institutional traders \u2013 had opened to lackluster appeal.\n\nPerhaps bitcoin is finally getting over this impasse, though we can\u2019t celebrate too much just yet. While the gain is solid, it has only been one day, and there are still many changes needed before bitcoin can be considered ready again to take on serious investors. A spike back up to the $9,000 (or hopefully $10,000 range) would likely do the trick. Enthusiasts probably need to see that bitcoin is returning to form prior to its sudden demise. From there, higher trading could potentially come back in spades.\n\nNaturally, analysts are now weighing in on why bitcoin could have jumped so suddenly, and what\u2019s in store for the currency over the remaining months. Zhao Dong, a shareholder of Bitfinex, believes that the crypto market will potentially incur significant spikes throughout the rest of 2019. He explains:\n\nThe next three months could be the last opportunity for bottom fishers, and after that, the crypto market will enter spring and then summer, estimated to rally together with China\u2019s stock market in 2021.\n\nCould the Rest of the Year Hold Solid Gains?\n\nIndeed, the final three months of the year really seem to be readying themselves for a monster bitcoin rally. What we\u2019ve kind of witnessed throughout 2019 is behavior that bitcoin exhibited in 2016, in which the currency incurred several smaller spikes throughout those 12 months before finally (albeit briefly) hitting the $1,000 mark at the time of Donald Trump\u2019s election to the White House.\n\nThe currency is at a higher place than where it stood in 2016; thus, the spikes its been experiencing since April have been larger but are still small in comparison to where bitcoin stood at the end of 2017. Granted it remains in its present loop, we could potentially see bitcoin jump back up to its \u201csummer numbers\u201d by the end of the year before hitting the \u201cbig time\u201d in 2020, which also happens to be the time of another election, and as we\u2019ve witnessed, elections arguably work in BTC\u2019s favor.", "description": "Bitcoin, the world's number one cryptocurrency by market cap, is trading for well over $8,500, marking a huge jump in price over 24 hours.", "authors": ["Nick Marinoff"], "top_image": "https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2019/01/Bitcoin-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
