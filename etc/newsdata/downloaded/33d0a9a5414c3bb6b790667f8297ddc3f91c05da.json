The word \u2018nationalism,\u2019 as it exists in today\u2019s political lexicon, connotes xenophobia and white supremacy, and printing it in large letters on the back of our paper would have marginalized people of color on our campus and our staff. I prioritized the sensibilities and trust of our audience over the ad revenue, and I stand by my decision.\u201d\n\nThe educational watchdog Campus Reform obtained the original ad on Monday.\n\n\u201cNationalism is based on love, not hate. Nationalism created a world of peace, not war. Nationalism unites us, rather than divides us,\u201d the ad states.\n\n\u201cOne wonders if anyone at NYU is allowed to mention that Alexander Hamilton, Henry Clay, Abraham Lincoln, and TR were all nationalists, or if this would be too triggering,\u201d Mr. Lowry began a series of tweets. \u201cThis poisonous and lazy misunderstanding of the word nationalism \u2014 and the idea behind it \u2014 is why I wrote the book, and why people inclined to reflexively reject it should pause and actually listen.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
