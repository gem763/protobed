The problem is when you start the treatment you\u2019re on a low ebb. Most of the treatment takes a few weeks to kick in.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"One day of depression is an eternity. and then another day and another day.\n\n\"The awful thing for me was you have sleep disturbance and can\u2019t get off to sleep. You have early morning awakening. It's 4am, it's dark, you\u2019re left with your mind that has dark thoughts. It's very difficult.\n\n\"The antidepressants start working. They didn\u2019t suddenly bring me back.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nDr Chris explained that two thirds of patients respond to antidepressants, while 25% respond to a blank sugar tablet placebo.\n\nSymptoms include a loss of interest in things that you used you enjoy.\n\nChris said: \"Loss of interest in family, friends, hobbies, reading, work. I found a loss of interest in humour.\n\n\"I love Billy Connolly. Going through this spell of depression I didn't find him funny at all. You just don't care. No interest.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis Morning's resident doctor advised viewers to speak to someone and go and seek help.\n\nChris added: \"If you\u2019ve got some of those symptoms and getting them very day for a week go and see your GP.\n\n\"The earlier we intervene with education the quicker you get back to normal. Antidepressants do work. I\u2019m living proof.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nThis Morning viewers noticed Chris' voice was a bit croaky and took to Twitter to question whether he was feeling under the weather.\n\nOne fans said: \"Is Dr Chris ok? He doesn't look too well\"\n\n\"Dr Chris is sounding decidedly rough,\" added another.\n\nA third asked: \"Has dr chris got a cold?\"\n\n\"I think Dr Chris needs to see a Dr. He doesn\u2019t sound too well,\" said a fourth.\n\n*This Morning airs weekdays on ITV at 10.30am", "description": "This Morning's much-loved resident doctor discussed his battle with depression and using antidepressants", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20537096.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_for-Dr-Chris-health-as-he-bravely-discusses-depression_5544JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
