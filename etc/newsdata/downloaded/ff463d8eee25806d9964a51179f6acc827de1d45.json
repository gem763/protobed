After a video review, Neal Maupay scored the penalty for Brighton in the 80th.\n\nBrighton claimed the three points when Lucas Digne turned a cross into his own net in the fourth minute of stoppage time.\n\nEverton could also be without Brazilian winger Bernard for upcoming games after he slipped and hurt his knee.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A stoppage-time own goal handed Brighton a dramatic 3-2 comeback English Premier League win over Everton, which had been leading with 10 minutes to go on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2018/11/10/britain_soccer_premier_league_51355_c0-706-2040-1896_s1200x700.jpg?f713bec9286148bfd95537b34a3781fdd0825e6f", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
