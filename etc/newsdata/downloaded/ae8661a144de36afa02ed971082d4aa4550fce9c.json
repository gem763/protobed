We might have the election sooner rather than later so I'm not going to write the manifesto here.\n\n\"What I haven't seen is any evidence either way that says what a subscription based system would do in terms of the revenue.\n\n\"I would need to understand what, if you were going to change, that would do to their income.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"Overall, I think that the BBC is a very important institution for this country, it's an enormous part of our soft power around the world, but undoubtedly the broadcasting sector is changing.\n\n\"We all know from streaming services and everything else, and the way the younger generation consume services, it is going to change.\"\n\nAsked if she was open-minded about the possibility she added: \"I am open-minded and I will have discussions and listen to evidence on all sides.\"\n\nMs Morgan later repeated her comments in an interview with ITV's Robert Peston.\n\nShe said last night: \u201cIf there were to be any changes clearly there would be a time for phasing and details and all those sorts of things, to be worked out.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\"You know what I\u2019ve been impressed coming into this job actually is really how brilliant our public service broadcasters are in this country.\n\n\"We want to keep them that way, but there is undoubtedly more competition in the market coming in.\n\n\"BBC, ITV and others they make great drama, we want to make sure that, you know, broadcast sporting events, they are hugely popular, they are very influential for the UK around the world, and we want to make sure that they stay that way and are very sustained.\"\n\nMs Morgan's comments are likely to spark alarm among BBC bosses and supporters who rely heavily on the licence fee - paid by anyone who watches live TV.\n\nA hardcore group of Tory MPs have long campaigned for the fee to be scrapped in the belief it is out of date for today's media landscape.\n\n(Image: PA Wire/PA Images)\n\nA BBC spokesman told The Times the licence fee is fixed for the next eight years so \"any debate about future funding is a long way off\".\n\nElsewhere Ms Morgan refused to reverse the BBC's decision to scrap free TV licences for over 75s after funding and responsibility was withdrawn by the Tory government.\n\nShe said she had \"no plans\" to review the television licence shake-up.\n\nThe BBC agreed in 2015, following negotiations with then chancellor George Osborne over the terms of the licence fee, to fund the free licences afforded to those aged over 75.\n\nBut the BBC announced this year that only low-income households in receipt of pension credits would receive the benefit, meaning around 3.7 million elderly people will be faced with a \u00a3154.50 annual bill for a colour TV licence from 2020.\n\nThe broadcaster said that without the reform it would have to close whole television channels and radio stations, such as BBC4 and BBC Radio 5Live, to fund the free coverage for pensioners.\n\nMPs on the digital, culture, media and sport committee published a report last week calling for the pensioner benefit to be reinstated.\n\nThey said: \"The BBC and the Government must reach an agreement to allow the funding of free licence fees for the over-75s to continue after 2020.\"", "description": "Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan said the landscape is \"going to change\" and repeatedly refused to rule out scrapping the licence fee in future", "authors": ["Dan Bloom", "Image", "Getty", "Peter Summers", "Afp Getty Images", "Pa Wire Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18928092.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_People-walk-past-Broadcasting-House.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
