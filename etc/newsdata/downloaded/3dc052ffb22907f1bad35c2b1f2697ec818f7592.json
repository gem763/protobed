Compromise is key to achieving win\u2013win outcomes and mutual trust.\u201d\n\nWhile acknowledging that legitimate issues in the global trade system must be addressed, Frydenberg, the treasurer of Australia, Heng Swee Keat, deputy prime minister and finance minister of Singapore, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, finance minister of Indonesia, and Canadian finance minister Bill Morneau argue that uncertainty over the global outlook is forcing a slowdown in trade and manufacturing.\n\n\u201cFinancial-market volatility and currency instability are on the rise, amid declining capital flows to emerging economies. Deteriorating global trade conditions are affecting investor confidence, business spending and productivity.\n\n\u201cWe need to reverse course, and that requires acting collectively \u2026 we need to protect free and open markets.\u201d\n\nThe ministers said the multilateral system established after the end of the second world war \u201callows both big and small countries to fulfil their potential\u201d. Australia, Canada and Indonesia are members of the G20. Singapore is a regular invitee to the forum as leader of the Global Governance Group of small to medium-sized economies.\n\n\u201cThe free flow of trade, investment and ideas has helped lift more people out of poverty than ever before,\u201d the ministers write. \u201cAnd the world\u2019s growing middle classes are now broadening the opportunities for further exchange of goods, services and innovation.\u201d\n\nUS defence strategy in Indo-Pacific region faces 'unprecedented crisis' Read more\n\nThe ministers argue the multilateral system, in particular bodies such as the G20, can return the global economy to a more transparent and cooperative environment.\n\nThey cite the 2008 collective response to the global financial crisis and the 2015 measures to address multinational corporate tax avoidance as examples of international cooperation that had benefited all countries.\n\n\u201cTo restore lost confidence, our multilateral system needs newfound strength to withstand the complexity of our current circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe ministers\u2019 remarks come as US president Donald Trump continues to escalate his rhetorical trade war against China, describing it as a \u201cthreat to the world\u201d and arguing Beijing uses money made through unfair trade practices to boost its military spending.\n\n\u201cObviously, China is a threat to the world in a sense, because they\u2019re building a military faster than anybody,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI view China in many different ways. But right now, I\u2019m thinking about trade. But, you know, trade equals military.\u201d\n\nSince July 2018, the US has imposed tariffs on US$360bn of Chinese goods and has plans to tax nearly all Chinese imports by the end of 2019. China has retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products.\n\nSigns of progress are undermined by setbacks. Last week, about 400 goods, including plastic straws, dog leashes and Christmas tree lights, were excluded by the US from tariffs. But a Chinese trade delegation hastily cancelled a planned visit to farms in Montana and Nebraska, a trip widely forecast as indication Beijing may have been prepared to increase its purchases of US agricultural products.\n\nAs both countries prepare to return to high-level negotiations next month, Trump quashed speculation he might settle for an interim trade deal with China to boost the US economy in the lead-up to the presidential election next year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a complete deal, I\u2019m not looking for a partial deal. We\u2019re looking for the big deal.\u201d\n\nThe US is publicly burnishing its collegiate credentials, meeting with key allies in recent days. Trump has had effusive and high-profile public events with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, in the past week.\n\n", "description": "Treasurer Josh Frydenberg joins finance ministers of Canada, Singapore and Indonesia to call for compromise on trade", "authors": ["Ben Doherty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4df7008ce67a77668dc2b08983c084af714a6ae2/0_394_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc8d1b380f2910affa6f12c64c5f442a", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
