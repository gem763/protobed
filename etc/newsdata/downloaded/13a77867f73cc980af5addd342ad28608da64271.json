Wallin's life can change forever in Sin City on Saturday night, but his dad won't be there to see it.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

He was here in New York in April and he told me that time that if something would happen to him I had to keep working hard, keep training and fighting.\n\n\u201cHe wasn't ill. He had diabetes, problems with his feet and stuff. He died of a heart attack, it was probably related to the diabetes when he said it but I don't know why. Maybe he felt something or maybe not.\n\n\u201cI've just been trying to keep going like he said. Even the day after he passed away I was in the gym working out. I was thinking about him. It was hard to keep it together, I was almost crying on and off but I got through it. I stayed in the gym and it has paid off.\u201d\n\nBoxing is not a big part of life for most of the 100,000 people who live in Sundsvall, the small town on the eastern coast of Sweden, where ice hockey and cross-country skiing are the more common past-times. \u201cIt's definitely quieter than Vegas,\u201d Wallin says.\n\nProfessional boxing was outlawed in Sweden between 1970 and 2006 and it remains a very marginal sport as a result but things were different in the Wallin household.\n\n\u201cMy dad never pushed me into it but he was a boxer and a trainer,\u201d he adds. \u201cYou can say he was my first trainer but not officially. In the house he would work with me.\n\n\u201cI have two older brothers, we would play fight a lot. I started boxing at 15 because my parents didn't let me start before that. When I started high school they said I could go. I fell in love with it right away. I knew boxing was what I wanted to do.\u201d\n\nA solid amateur boxing career followed, including two defeats to a Londoner called Anthony Joshua, before he turned professional five years ago. His decision to go full-time, however, meant turning his back on a career in the prison service which involved working at a facility for the 'mentally ill'.\n\n\u201cThat was when I was 19 until I was 22 when I turned pro,\u201d he explains. \u201cI was there just looking after them and making sure everything was ok.\n\n\u201cI would serve them food and take them out. It gave me a different perspective on life, it was crazy sometimes, seeing what people go through.\n\n\u201cSometimes they might be murderers or paedophiles but they are sick, you can't see if people are sick in the head. You can see if someone has cancer or something, that's different. It was special, it was a good experience.\u201d\n\nSo too, has his first taste of Las Vegas, despite being written off by just about everyone in the boxing world this week. It is difficult to deny that there are similarities between him and Tom Schwarz who was brutally vanquished by Fury in this same city just 13 weeks ago.\n\nLike Schwarz, he is a reasonably obscure undefeated European heavyweight who arrived in Nevada with the distinction of being ranked inside the top five by one of the governing bodies. Also, like Schwarz, his credentials as a challenger to arguably the finest heavyweight of his generation have been widely dismissed.\n\n\u201cI couldn't care less what people think,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don't know me. They can say whatever they want. I put in a lot of hard work over the years, a lot of sacrifices over the years. I care about what my family and friends think and they're all for it.\n\n\u201cThis is a fight, an opportunity you can't say no to. I wanted the fight. I feel like I belong at this level and I'm ready to prove it.\u201d\n\nTyson Fury takes on Otto Wallin live on BT Sport Box Office this Saturday.
