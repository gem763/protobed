He said the lack of a rule-making process for the change might become a liability in court for the administration.\n\nCapps said the proclamation does not outline a concrete path for visa petitioners to prove they will either obtain health insurance or cover all medical costs in the U.S.\n\nThe order instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to establish \"standards and procedures\" for U.S. consular offices to determine whether applicants satisfy the new requirements. The State Department did not immediately respond to questions regarding what \u2014 if any \u2014 steps the agency is taking to comply with the proclamation.\n\nImmigration advocates were quick to denounce the announcement, saying it represents yet another effort by the Trump administration to penalize low-income immigrants.\n\n\"The Trump administration today launched two more shameless attacks on low-income people and immigrants, by proposing dramatic cuts to life-saving food stamps and seeking to prevent immigrants lacking access to health insurance \u2014 of which the administration works constantly to deprive them \u2014from entering the country on immigrant visas,\" Javier Vald\u00e9s, co-director of the immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York, said in a statement.\n\nIn his order, Mr. Trump invoked the same provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act that his administration used to announce the travel ban against predominately Muslim countries, as well as a sweeping asylum restriction on migrants who crossed the border illegally between ports of entry.", "description": "It's the latest crackdown in legal immigration from the Trump administration", "authors": ["Camilo Montoya-Galvez"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/02/ae167034-41e5-4e86-a772-44384f31f8c7/thumbnail/1200x630/fa4ed57e2627c2f0d2c84967953d1e3e/gettyimages-1162402975.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
