Not for syndication\n\nThe final report of the National Transportation Safety Committee team that investigated the 29 October 2018 crash also found technical malfunctions with the Boeing 737-8 (MAZ) aircraft discovered on a flight three days earlier were not effectively documented.\n\nFamilies of the crash victims were briefed on the report's findings in Jakarta on Thursday before a media briefing on Friday. The report, which should be released in the next 24 hours, is also understood to have found extensive problems with the design and certification of Boeing's flight control system known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\n\"The absence of guidance on MCAS, or more detailed use of trim in the flight manuals and in pilot training, made it more difficult for flight crews to properly respond to uncommanded MCAS,\" NTSC spokesman Nurcahyo Utomo told the packed press conference on Friday.\n\nA US investigation commissioned by the FAA has already concluded the FAA failed to properly review the MCAS. It also found Boeing did not provide adequate information during the certification process.", "description": "Insufficient documentation, inadequate maintenance reports and poor communication caused the crash that killed 189 people, investigators have found.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_3.3111%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_106/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9c1fa100f2a0ea7a301fb30dcf849b8987b2ed25", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
