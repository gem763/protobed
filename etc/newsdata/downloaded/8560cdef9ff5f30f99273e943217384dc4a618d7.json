During her time on the cobbles, she also built up quite the relationship with Seb (Harry Visinoni) \u2014 whom she met while he completed a building job at the nail bar.\n\nAlthough he was first unaware of her circumstances, the truth eventually came to light, when Jan Losinski (Piotr Baumann) brought down the slavery ring. In spite of their burgeoning relationship, Alina and Seb were forced to go their separate ways when Alina left earlier this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it appears as if the young couple could have another shot at happiness, as The Daily Star reports that Coronation Street bosses are bringing back actress Ruxandra.\n\nA source told The Daily Star: \u2018Alina\u2019s harrowing story was one of the biggest of the year and Ruxandra\u2019s performance during some of the darker scenes was heartbreaking.\n\n\u2018She proved very popular with the viewers and everyone was gutted that Alina and Seb didn\u2019t get their happy ending. So with her returning later this year it looks like their love story is far from over.\u2019\n\n\u2018There\u2019s so much scope for the writers given everything that she\u2019s been through. Everyone is very excited about her return.\u2019\n\nCoronation Street returns on Wednesday 16th October at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Will romance blossom between her and Seb?", "authors": ["Stephen Patterson"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Alina-Corrie-a0cb_1570799660.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
