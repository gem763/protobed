I couldn't even speak,' she said on KIIS 1065 radio on Wednesday\n\n'People had to massage my feet because they cramped up, I was in such a hell in my mind.\n\n'Mental illness is real and a lot of people accused me of faking this. If i could have lived without it, my life (now) would be so much better.'\n\nCorby said she was visited by psychologist Dr Jonathan Phillips, who gave evidence at the Lindt Cafe inquest, who was shocked by her condition.\n\n'He told Mercedes he had never experienced seeing someone in such a catatonic state and didn't know if I'd come out of it,' she said.\n\nCorby said she was mute because imaginary birds were telling her to stay quiet and 'not let them know anything' and she honestly thought Dr Phillips was children's TV character Mr Squiggle.\n\nOne night guards found her inside the prison's roof cavity looking for ducks, as her addled brain thought ducks meant water so she could escape on a boat.\n\nCorby said on KIIS 1065 radio that her mental health deteriorated after her final appeal for smuggling 4.2kg of marijuana found in her boogie board at Denpasar Airport bag failed\n\nCorby, 42, tearfully recounted the Kyle and Jackie O how she was such a 'fruit loop' that her sister Mercedes (right) slept numerous nights in her cell to keep her alive\n\nTo this day she has vivid and distressing flashbacks of the psychotic visions that haunted her behind bars.\n\nCorby many times thought she would die in jail and credited Merdecdes with her survival.\n\n'Mercedes slept in prison with me a few times, I couldn't sleep I couldn't eat. People had to hand feed me and I couldn't even swallow, they'd have to put water down my throat. I was a zombie.'\n\n'I would be dead if it wasn't for Mercedes. She doesn't know how much she did for me,' she said, her voice breaking through tears.\n\nCorby is still with her Sumatran boyfriend Mr Panangian, who runs a stand up paddle board shop in Bali, whom she met while on parole on the island.\n\n'He doesn't want to move, he loves his life,' she said. 'I see him once a year.'\n\nThe former beauty student said she was allowed to go to Bali to visit and potentially live full-time with him, but 'I'm not ready'.\n\nThey have travelled to other countries to meet and are trying to have a baby on a 'if it happens, it happens' basis.\n\nShe said she has been asked to star on reality television programs including The Bachelorette, but declined because of her relationship.\n\nCorby said another of the worst parts of her incarceration was seeing the impact it had on her family, and missing her father Michael's funeral.\n\nCorby said she was mute because imaginary birds were telling her to stay quiet and 'not let them know anything'\n\nCorby (right) is in a long-term relationship with Ben Panangian (left), 38, an Indonesian surfer she first met at a church service at Kerobokan Prison in 2006\n\nShe also spoke of how heartbroken she was to not be allowed to give her family a final hug after her sentencing.\n\n'It was excruciating, I couldn't understand how this was happening to my life,' she said.\n\nHer mother Rosleigh Rose even tried to convince Indonesian authorities to let her trade places, saying sad she'd lived her life and wanted her daughter to live hers.\n\nWhile behind bars, Corby spent three weeks in isolation for breaking phone rules in jail and as a result has a phobia of talking on the phone and can only video chat.\n\nShe described the constant smell of raw sewage throughout the prison and how her mother would clean the filthy court holding cell toilets before each of her hearings.\n\nCorby said arriving home after almost 12 years trapped in Bali was 'quite emotional' and she is still struggling to adapt.\n\n'I'm still coming to terms with being a new version of me... I don't want to be looking over my shoulder, I just want to be able to live,' she said.\n\nShe has learned to ignore the many internet trolls who send her abuse, but is uncomfortable to have people recognise her in public.\n\nPeople regularly come up and talk to her, but she said no one has said anything nasty to her face.\n\nCorby many times thought she would die in jail and credited Merdecdes with her survival\n\nShe doesn't have a full time job and spending her time epoxy resin painting to take her mind off the lasting effects of her jail experience.\n\nCorby said she was still struggling to deal with her father's death as she missed the funeral and never properly grieved.\n\n'Funerals are really important to say goodbye and I wasn't there so couldn't feel like I'm still in limbo,' she said.\n\nShe also injured her leg weeks after arriving home and had three knee operations in the space of a year.\n\nOne changed she noticed upon her return to Australia was that everything was wrapped in plastic in supermarkets, and how little sense that made with the plastic bag ban.\n\nShe is also catching up with technology, like using a Samsung smartphone as opposed to the old Nokia handsets she had in prison.\n\nCorby on Studio 10 the same day recalled how she had little or no reaction to the news she was being released form jail, due to her mental state.\n\n'I was very numb. I felt practically nothing,' she said.\n\n'It was very much when I was first arrested. I thought, oh, I'll wait till Monday, when the shops reopen.'\n\nShe still cringes and being introduced in media as 'convicted drug trafficker Schapelle Corby' and hopes to one day clear her name.\n\n'I have this phenomenal, dedicated people cold the Expendable Project, and they have spent years getting information, government documents,' she said.\n\n'And for me, it proves what I say about myself and I think all the evidence is there.'\n\nCorby earlier claimed she was bullied in jail by Bali 9 member Renae Lawrence, who she was initially friends with but their relationship deteriorated quickly.\n\n'I was very fearful of her,' Corby said.\n\n'I've had comments from other people who saw us in the visit area together and were like 'how do you let her speak to you like that' but I wasn't really seeing it,' she said.\n\nCorby earlier claimed she was bullied in jail by Bali 9 member Renae Lawrence (pictured), who she was initially friends with but their relationship deteriorated quickly\n\nAfter her father passed away from cancer in 2008, Corby's mental health deteriorated, which drove her into a 'dark state of mind' when combined with Lawrence's alleged bullying.\n\nLawrence's lawyer Drew Hamilton said his client vehemently denied allegations of bullying Corby when contacted by the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nCorby acknowledged there were times her behaviour wasn't perfect, but she kept out of Lawrence's way as much as she could until they were able to live together without drama in the same block.\n\nThis month marked 15 years since she became a household name when the then 27-year-old beauty student was arrested at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport for drug smuggling, a crime she still denies committing.\n\nAfter a series of sentence reductions, Corby was released on parole in February 2014 after nine years behind bars.\n\nHospitalised twice for mental health issues before her release, she says thought she would die in prison.\n\n'It's so amazing that I'm actually here. I did not think I would actually be able to leave \u2014 like I would die in there,' she said.\n\nShe said she has been asked to star on reality television programs including The Bachelorette, but declined because of her relationship\n\nAfter three living in Bali, she was deported back to Australia in May 2017 amid a media frenzy.\n\nEarlier this month she told Woman's Day magazine earlier they were trying for a baby although the couple only spend 'two precious weeks a year together' because Ben is unable to enter Australia due to his criminal record.\n\nLife since she returned hasn't been easy- struggling to find employment with her infamy and plagued with flashbacks of her incarceration.\n\nNow residing with her mum south of Brisbane, leaving the house has become difficult without being stalked by paparazzi.\n\nCorby is promoting a new version of her memoir 'My Story', which documents her time in prison.\n\nIt promises to be a 'fully revised and updated' version of her life since her release from Kerobokan Prison in 2014 and her return to Australia.\n\nShe is not receiving any money for the book, due to proceeds of crimes laws, but said the book was 'not about money' and was just cathartic.\n\n'It is about me finishing my story. It is about going back and being cathartic to myself and my supporters, to let them know what really happened,' she said.", "description": "Schapelle Corby was so mentally unhinged in her Bali prison cell she couldn't feed herself and thought her psychologist was Mr Squiggle, while her sister Mercedes kept her alive.", "authors": ["Nic White For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/23/20352224-0-image-a-19_1572390695736.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
