Next, get ready for... Meghan Markle \u2013 President of the United States.\n\nBear with me, for this strange idea is quite the talk of the toff weekend dinner party set.\n\nThe notion of Meghan becoming president is at the centre of a script being shopped around major television networks.\n\nThey include Netflix, which was home to Meghan\u2019s TV series Suits and is about to broadcast the latest series of The Crown.\n\nFirst she was a game show model, then a Netflix TV star and now she\u2019s a Duchess. Next, get ready for... Meghan Markle \u2013 President of the United States\n\nThe potentially hilarious show takes place in a world where William and Kate are King and Queen and Meghan is US President \u2013 with Harry taking the \u2018First Lady\u2019 role.\n\nIt\u2019s set ten years into the future, so I dread to think what has happened to Prince Charles \u2013 or the Queen for that matter.\n\nMy source tells me the script is in the hands of a production company and news of its existence has spread from the British TV industry to toffland.\n\nBefore you scoff, this comes from the same circuit of people who brought us news that Helena Bonham Carter had been talking to the late Princess Margaret via a medium, which the actress recently confessed was true.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the same set that brought us the even more unbelievable news that Prince Harry had met a divorced, older US TV star and had flown her to Botswana for their third date.\n\nThe potentially hilarious show takes place in a world where William and Kate are King and Queen and Meghan is US President \u2013 with Harry taking the \u2018First Lady\u2019 role\n\nThe show is not exactly dystopian \u2013 after all, what can be so wrong in a world where the Duchess of Cambridge is Queen? But it sounds to me like it has got all the markings of a devilish Black Mirror-style project.\n\nCharlie Brooker\u2019s series about a twisted, high-tech world airs on Netflix \u2013 and its first-ever episode was a tale about how the Duchess of Cambridge was kidnapped and held for ransom.\n\nSays my source: \u2018This script has been doing the rounds and it\u2019s been a hot topic of conversation on the shooting pegs. It\u2019s even been mentioned by someone who is a regular visitor to Balmoral, though the writers have somehow managed to kill off Prince Charles which is not exactly tactful.\n\n\u2018Prince Harry will play a First Lady role in the script. His character is somewhat subordinate and promotes healthy living, kindness and respect. In a role reversal, Meghan will be the head of government of the US.\u2019\n\nIt promises much scope for amusement with scenes that could involve King William and Queen Kate co-hosting State banquets with Harry... for his wife, the President.\n\nWell, stranger things have happened \u2013 who would have thought a certain bouffant-haired reality TV star could ever get that job\u2026?\n\nCrush of the week... Albina Kireeva\n\nMy crush of the week is fashion model, professional ballroom dancer and actress Albina Kireeva \u2013 whose idea of a Halloween fashion accessory is a black stallion.\n\nAlbina is famous for clip-clopping her way to a Day Of The Dead-themed Halloween bash, pictured below, at Soho\u2019s Toy Room club last year, on a stallion named Velvet Blaze loaned by an animal acting agency.\n\nDressed in a black leotard, furry ears and body glitter Albina, 25, made quite the impression and has been a fixture on the celebrity social scene ever since \u2013 spending evenings at exclusive clubs Annabel\u2019s and 5 Hertford Street.\n\nRussian-born Albina is a regular at the Cannes film festival where she met her Australian financier boyfriend Richard Hanes, with whom she lives in a Notting Hill mansion.\n\nMy crush of the week is fashion model, professional ballroom dancer and actress Albina Kireeva \u2013 whose idea of a Halloween fashion accessory is a black stallion\n\nAside from her penchant for stallions, Albina has 14 pet wallabies and a beloved white rabbit named Lily, last seen \u2013 as my picture, above, shows \u2013 with her at 5 Hertford Street\n\nAside from her penchant for stallions, Albina has 14 pet wallabies and a beloved white rabbit named Lily, last seen \u2013 as my picture, above, shows \u2013 with her at 5 Hertford Street.\n\nTelling me about this year\u2019s Halloween plans, Albina said at the Mont Blanc: In Transit launch party last week: \u2018I am planning to go dressed as the Night Queen to fit the Game Of Thrones theme.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s hard to top riding in on a massive black horse but I intend to try my best.\u2019\n\nYou\u2019ve got to admire a girl with so much ambition...\n\nCillian Murphy tells me he can\u2019t get his finely shaved head around Peaky Blinders fans copying his famous haircut.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s nuts that the short-back-and-sides haircut has become so loved by fashionistas and hipsters,\u2019 says Cillian, 43, who plays the Brummy mafia boss Tommy Shelby in the BBC show. \u2018I keep saying, \u201cYou do realise the style was invented to prevent lice?\u201d \u2019\n\nTo be fair, not an entirely uncommon complaint for the average hipster, surely?", "description": "TALK OF THE TOWN: The potentially hilarious show takes place in a world where William and Kate are King and Queen and Meghan is US President - with Harry taking the 'First Lady' role.", "authors": ["Charlotte Griffiths For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19937744-0-image-a-7_1571520539216.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
