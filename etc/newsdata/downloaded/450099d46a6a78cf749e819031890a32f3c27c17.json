WeWork Postpones Long-Awaited Listing as Valuations Plummet\n\n(Bloomberg) -- WeWork pushed back its much-awaited initial public offering, and said it now expects to complete the listing by the end of this year as concerns mount over the company\u2019s governance, valuation and business prospects.\n\nBloomberg News reported earlier that the offering is likely to be postponed until at least October. WeWork had planned to begin making its pitch to investors in a roadshow as soon as this week.\n\n\u201cThe We Co. is looking forward to our upcoming IPO, which we expect to be completed by the end of the year,\u201d the company said in a statement on Monday evening in New York. \u201cWe want to thank all of our employees, members and partners for their ongoing commitment.\u201d\n\nSoftBank Group Corp., the office-rental company\u2019s biggest investor, had pressed WeWork to put off the stock offering amid doubts about the business, people familiar with the matter said previously.\n\nIn January, SoftBank made its last investment in WeWork, renamed the We Co., at a valuation of $47 billion. The company was more recently expected to be valued at only about $15 billion in a listing and perhaps even less, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nThe decision to postpone the listing will at least temporarily sideline an important source of capital for the money-losing business and could threaten a $6 billion credit financing that was contingent on a successful offering. The facility requires the company to carry out its IPO by Dec. 31, Bloomberg News previously reported.\n\nThe biggest backers of SoftBank\u2019s $100 billion Vision Fund are now reconsidering how much to commit to its next investment vehicle after the oversized bet on WeWork soured. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund, which contributed $45 billion to the gargantuan fund, is now only planning to reinvest profits from that vehicle into its successor, according to people familiar with the talks.\n\nVision Fund\n\nAbu Dhabi\u2019s Mubadala Investment Co., which invested $15 billion in the Vision Fund, is considering paring its future commitment to below $10 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified in disclosing internal deliberations.\n\nThe delay also adds another sour note to a medley of high-profile but frequently disappointing IPOs this year. The offering was expected to have been the biggest after Uber Technologies (NYSE: ) Inc.\u2019s $8.1 billion listing and ahead of Avantor Inc.\u2019s $3.3 billion IPO and the $2.3 billion offering by Uber\u2019s ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc (NASDAQ: ). Of those three, only Avantor is trading above its offer price.\n\nWeWork\u2019s likely delay was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWeWork has become an extreme example of the excesses afforded to technology entrepreneurs in the era of unicorns -- startups valued at $1 billion or more. Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, was able to raise billions of dollars at astronomical valuations and spend freely, while retaining effective control over operations through special classes of stock.\n\nIn an effort to keep its IPO on track, WeWork last week took steps to limit Neumann\u2019s control of the company after an IPO, as well as other measures to improve its corporate governance.", "description": "WeWork Postpones Long-Awaited Listing as Valuations Plummet", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE1P1NK_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
