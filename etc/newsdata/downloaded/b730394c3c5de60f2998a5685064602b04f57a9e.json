There is stalled or negative growth in Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, and Mexico. At the same time, business confidence has turned negative in Japan for the first time since 2013 and China\u2019s industrial output is expanding at its weakest pace in close to 20 years.\n\nAfter a healthy 3.2 per cent expansion in 2018, global economic growth is set to weaken to 2.6 per cent this year and 2.5 per cent in 2020 according to the Conference Board of Canada\u2019s World Outlook Economic Forecast.\n\n\u201cComplex and historical geopolitical tensions and ongoing trade disputes are pulling global growth down\u201d says Kip Beckman, a Principle Economist at the Conference Board of Canada. \u201cDespite this, I don\u2019t foresee a global recession\u201d he says.\n\nThe main cause of the slumping global growth is the ongoing trade conflict between the United States and China. \u201cWhen you have two countries that together account for almost 50 per cent of the global economy\u2019s output, yes, the impact is far-reaching\u201d adds Beckman.\n\nWhile China-US trade tensions are grabbing global economic headlines, the geopolitical impacts of the tensions between Hong Kong and China, and between Japan and South Korea, are hurting growth prospects in Asia-Pacific. Weakening economic conditions in the EU have led the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates on bank reserves \u2013 the funds that commercial banks deposit at the ECB \u2013 for the first time since 2016.\n\nReal GDP for Latin America as a whole increased by only 1.2 per cent last year. An even weaker growth of 0.7 per cent is anticipated for 2019. Next year, growth should rise to 1.9 per cent\u2014a pace that is still far below the region\u2019s potential, given its relatively young population compared with those of North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.\n\nAbout the report:\n\nThe World Outlook Economic Forecast report examines the short-term economic outlook for the world\u2019s major economies.
