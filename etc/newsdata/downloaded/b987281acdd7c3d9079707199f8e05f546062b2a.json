The rates of eighth, 10th and 12th graders who use e-cigarettes continued to rise in 2019 and doubled from 2017 to 2019, according to research released last month . The United States is also facing an outbreak of lung injuries linked to vaping, many of them among young people.\n\n\"The high prevalence of flavored tobacco product use among middle and high school students is a concern because flavors can increase the appeal of tobacco products to youths, promote youth initiation of tobacco products, and result in lifelong tobacco product use,\" the report said.\n\nSince 2009, federal regulations have prohibited flavored cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol, but no such federal prohibition applied to other tobacco products. In the last few weeks, several states and cities around the United States have restricted sales of e-cigarette flavors, which can include fruit, chocolate and candy flavors. The FDA is also moving to clear the market of e-cigarette flavors.\n\nRead More", "description": "Flavored e-cigarette use among young people in the United States increased from 2014 to 2018, according to a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Food and Drug Administration.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151229182158-04-ecig-timeline-super-tease.jpg"}
