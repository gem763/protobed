(Financial Times)\n\nTalking point: Apple prevents most rivals from accessing the iPhone\u2019s near-field communication chip, a practice the firm has previously defended on the basis that it provides maximum security for sensitive banking data. Apple Pay is one of the largest players in the mobile-payment marketplace, an increasingly crowded space that\u2019s seeing attention from traditional lenders. It\u2019s a trend the European Commission is watching closely while it emerges as the world\u2019s toughest digital regulator. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager has vowed broader, tougher enforcement of tech giants, including yesterday\u2019s decision to force chipmaker Broadcom to halt allegedly anti-competitive behaviour before the commission finalizes its judgment of the firm. If the interim order holds up in court, the commission expects to use such measures against companies like Apple in future antitrust cases.", "description": "", "authors": ["Liza Agrba"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
