Bush administration evoked the specter of a \u201cmushroom cloud\u201d to make the case for intervention in the Middle East.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt took until Wednesday morning for Saudi Arabia to back up Pompeo\u2019s claim, with the Saudi defense ministry explicitly pointing to Iran and ruling out Yemen as the source of the drones and cruise missiles. In a dramatic news conference in Riyadh, Saudi officials displayed wrecked pieces of several recovered weapons and said the attack had come from the north, though they hadn\u2019t pinpointed the launch site.\n\nIn the interim, skepticism of the U.S.\u2019 credibility started to pour in. \u201cThis administration that lies about, whether maps or crowd sizes, cannot be trusted to give us the full information we need to be able to make a decision whether we should be going to war or not with Iran,\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) told CNN.\n\nColin Kahl, a former top national security aide in the Obama White House, tweeted: \u201cEstablishing whether Iran launched the attack & what an appropriate response would be are tough issues that would benefit from US international credibility\u2014credibility Trump has squandered as a result of his America First approach & constant lying.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration on Sunday released satellite photos it said proved the attack emanated from the north \u2014 not from Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels to the south, who had claimed responsibility. GOP senators emerged from a briefing Tuesday sounding pretty confident about Iran\u2019s culpability. CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported on additional intelligence pointing to Iran. And an array of experts told POLITICO that it seems likely Iran was behind in the attacks in some fashion.\n\nSo why the credibility gap?\n\nPart of the problem, Iran experts and former national security officials said, is the way Pompeo and President Donald Trump rushed to finger Iran before laying out a clear case or bringing allies on board.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

So it just looked like he was leaning forward too much.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the president himself: Trump\u2019s unusually high tally of public falsehoods has weakened trust in his pronouncements. So far, he\u2019s made 12,019 false or misleading statements since taking office, per The Washington Post (5,276 false as of May, per the Toronto Star) on subjects as minor as \u201cMorning Joe\u201d ratings and as major as the existence of his signature border wall.\n\n\u201cAt a minimum, if someone is constantly making errors and needs to be fact-checked, it breeds cynicism about the truthfulness of what they say,\u201d said Angie Drobnic Holan, editor of the Pulitzer-winning PolitiFact, which has evaluated 713 Trump statements and deemed more than two-thirds \u201cmostly false\u201d or worse. \u201cI think that would apply to anyone in any context.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, there\u2019s the long Iraq War hangover, with \u201cweapons of mass destruction\u201d still ringing in the ears of a war-weary public.\n\nAnd apparently the president, too: Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that while a military strike wasn\u2019t off the table, \u201chow did going into Iraq work out?\u201d\n\nIran, whose M.O. this year has been gradual escalation under the veneer of plausible deniability, can harness such an environment to its benefit. The drone strikes on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq processing facility and Khurais oil field hammered 5.7 million daily barrels of crude production, roughly 5 percent of the worldwide supply, and triggered the largest daily jump in oil prices in a decade.\n\nTypically, former national security officials said, the U.S. evaluates several types of intelligence to make a determination of responsibility after incidents like this, drawing conclusions at various confidence levels. Then it tries to marshal support from foreign allies \u2014 and members of Congress \u2014 behind the scenes by sharing as much intelligence as it deems appropriate.\n\nIn this case, Pompeo\u2019s tweets preceded all that. Even Trump wasn\u2019t as definitive in the subsequent days, saying \u201ccertainly it would look\u201d like Iran did it.\n\nThe U.K., France and Japan all said they were still reviewing intelligence, or that they hadn\u2019t yet seen evidence of Iranian culpability. The U.S. has so far failed to recruit many allies if it does want to retaliate militarily.\n\nIn part, the American case for blaming Iran depends on what the Trump administration wants to achieve. Trump on Wednesday announced significant (and vague) sanctions forthcoming \u2014 but he\u2019s leaning against military action. Experts said it seemed likely the administration simply wanted to keep building the case for its maximum-pressure campaign against Iran.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re just trying to blame Iran \u2026 there\u2019s no leverage that has to be applied\u201d with allies, said Jon Wolfsthal, senior adviser at Global Zero and a former Obama NSC senior director. \u201cThere\u2019s no diplomacy at work there. If, however, we actually want to have coordinated effective response, then the bar climbs.\u201d\n\nBut in this case, experts said, the evidence does indicate that Iran bears at least some responsibility for the explosions in Saudi Arabia, its regional arch-enemy.\n\nFabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said the attack was \u201cvery, very precise to a stunning degree,\u201d indicating a level of sophistication far beyond previous Houthi attacks.\n\n\u201cPeople are very critical of Trump, for very understandable reasons, and then might be too critical of many of the intelligence\u201d reports, he added.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday that while Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s briefing to the Senate GOP was short, he found it \u201cpretty convincing Iran is responsible.\u201d He added that once that\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d confirmed, the United States should come up with a response with its allies.\n\n\u201cThe Trump administration has to put American interests over the financial oil interests of the Saudi royal family and must come to Congress with more credible and persuasive evidence that we\u2019ve seen so far if they\u2019re going to blame the Iranians,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in an interview. \u201cThey owe us a better, fuller set of evidence and facts.\u201d\n\nThe nature of classified intelligence often gives government officials an uphill battle in convincing the public, others noted.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience, there is always skepticism in this type of scenario, when you\u2019re announcing a conclusion based on intelligence you can\u2019t share,\u201d said Michael Singh, managing director at the Washington Institute, who worked in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cAnd it\u2019s something that really bedevils policymakers.\u201d\n\nThe specter of the Iraq War lead-up, when Secretary of State Colin Powell famously told the United Nations about Iraqi weapons that did not in fact exist, still looms large. Standing on the floor of the Security Council chamber, he brandished a model vial of anthrax as a sign of the dangers and told the world, \u201cEvery statement I make today is backed up by sources, solid sources. These are not assertions. What we\u2019re giving you are facts and conclusions based on solid intelligence.\u201d\n\nYears later, Powell would acknowledge that some of the intelligence was inaccurate and that he regretted the speech.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want a repeat of the Iraq War, but at the same time you don\u2019t want an Iraq War hangover to impede you in this analysis,\u201d warned Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\nBut some of Trump\u2019s credibility gap stems from issues that are uniquely of his administration\u2019s own making.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re credible in the way they\u2019ve said it, particularly Secretary of State Pompeo,\u201d said retired Col. Larry Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to Powell and thought Tuesday that the Iran-backed Houthis were still the likeliest culprits. \u201cI just think they are reinforcing the, if you will, 2002/2003 image of, this is WMD in Iraq.\u201d\n\nDaniel Lippman and Marianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "Trump\u2019s unusually high tally of public falsehoods has weakened trust in his pronouncements.", "authors": ["Eli Okun"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/af/85/a2c708e04b338a04919ebdb2c2df/19918-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
