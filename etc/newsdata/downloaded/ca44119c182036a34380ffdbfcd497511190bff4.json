As newly minted CEO Yves Maitre admitted to me at Disrupt a couple of weeks back, the once mighty smartphone giant has lost the thread in recent years. But if nothing else, the Exodus project marks a glimpse at some potential smartphone future.\n\nWith this weekend\u2019s launch of the Exodus 1s at Berlin\u2019s Lightning conference, HTC aims to make it clear that the project is more than just a one-off. The new device lowers the barrier of entry to \u20ac219 (~$244). All said, not a bad price for those looking to dabble in the technology. Oh, and obviously it\u2019s available in all of the various equivalent cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe specs are fittingly pretty dismal. There\u2019s a Snapdragon 435, running Android 8.1. The screen is a 5.7 inch HD+, coupled with a decent 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Oh, and there\u2019s a microUSB port and, good news, a headphone jack. Honestly, it\u2019s a pretty low-end device, all told.\n\nThe big difference here being the the inclusion of a hardware wallet and Bitcoin node access. \u201cWe gave users the ability to own their own keys, and now we\u2019ve gone one step further to allow users to run their own full Bitcoin node,\u201d HTC\u2019s Phil Chen said in a release tied to the news. \u201cWe are providing the tools for access to universal basic finance; the tools to have a metaphorical Swiss bank in your pocket.\u201d\n\nMaitre told me the other week he still believes mainstream use of blockchain on these devices is more than two or three years out. What the 1s provides, however, is an inexpensive way to see what the technology provides today. Interested parties in Europe, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE can order it online starting today.", "description": "Whatever you might say about HTC (and believe me, there\u2019s plenty to say), at least the company takes some fascinating chance.
