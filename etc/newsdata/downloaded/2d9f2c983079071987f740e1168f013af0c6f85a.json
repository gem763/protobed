I campaigned in Joburg and we wrote a letter sending the car back. I have since used my personal vehicle for work purposes.\"\n\nIn a separate tweet, Maimane said \"the smear campaign continues\". He tweeted about \"gutless individuals\" who are spreading lies \"about me and my family\".\n\n\n\n\"I have always sought to build a South Africa for all. I remain committed to that vision, regardless of how uncomfortable it may make others feel.\"\n\nNews24 reported that his leadership of the organisation was expected to be under the spotlight when the party gathered for a crucial federal council meeting on October 18. It appears provincial leaders have thrown their support behind him.\n\n- Compiled by Jenna Etheridge", "description": "DA leader Mmusi Maimane is facing pressure from within his own party over the use of a hired car - paid for by Steinhoff - and his rental of a house in Claremont, Cape Town.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7497/5c7cef15b8c946f699dda99b9d8dd102.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
