We know the format, we know what it is, but whenever you play in the Champions League you know you're playing against the best and for me that is the format and the beauty of it.'\n\nThe proposals to expand the competition are being led by Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli\n\nLampard believes enough matches are played and would not want to see the League Cup impacted should a wider expansion of European football occur.\n\n'As a manager I actually feel weight of games more than I did as a player, even though I was running around as a player,' he explained.\n\n'As a manager you're thinking about how can you keep the team fresh, and it's a challenge with all the competitions we have now.\n\n'I have a soft spot for the League Cup because we won it a couple of times at Chelsea, and it was the first competition I ever won. Domestically it gives teams a feeling you can compete on a level in a cup at home, which is important.\n\n'If you ask me can we play more European games, I personally don't believe you can fit them in amongst our busy schedule.\n\n'I would find it hard to keep the quality level and the freshness within the players. If you did do that there would be a lot of discussion about how that would work practically. At the minute I think the level is about right. I like the format personally.'", "description": "Frank Lampard has spoken out against expansion of the Champions League.
