He left the White House on Sept. 20, 10 days after Bolton was fired.\n\nAdditionally, the former deputy national security adviser was on the July 25 call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nDemocrats are investigating an allegation Trump linked U.S. military aid to public declarations by Zelensky that he would investigate Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden's tenure on the board of a Ukrainian energy company called Burisma, and a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nTrump has maintained he did nothing wrong, there was no quid pro quo, and the call was he had with Zelensky was 'perfect.'\n\nKupperman is of high interest to the Democrats given that he was listening on the line when Trump and Zelensky spoke.\n\nCongressional Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry sent Kupperman a letter on Saturday telling he was under subpoena and obligated to appear.\n\n'The deposition will begin on time and, should your client defy the subpoena, his absence will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding,' Representatives Adam Schiff, Eliot Engel and Carolyn Maloney wrote to him.\n\nThey accused him of using the lawsuit as a delaying tactic.\n\nIt is 'an obvious and desperate tactic by the president to delay and obstruct the lawful constitutional functions of Congress and conceal evidence about his conduct from the impeachment inquiry,' they charged.\n\nKupperman served in the Trump White House and left shortly after President Trump fired John Bolton\n\nKupperman was on the July 25 phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky - the two men are seen together at the UN in September\n\nCooper, however, claimed his client never consulted with the White House about his lawsuit.\n\n'It would not be appropriate for a private citizen, like Dr. Kupperman, to unilaterally resolve this momentous constitutional dispute between the two political branches of our government,' he said in a statement.\n\nCooper also represents Bolton - Trump's former Nation Security Adviser who tops the Democrats' wish list for witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.\n\n'Obviously he has very relevant information and we want him to testify,' Schiff said Sunday on ABC's 'This Week' of Bolton.\n\nBolton's attorneys have spoken to congressional staff about the former National Security Adviser testifying.\n\nBolton has been on the Democrats' wish-list for a witness after he was revealed to be critical of efforts within the administration and from Trump's allies to pressure the Ukraine into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nHe was so alarmed by the moves he alerted a lawyer, his former aide Fiona Hill testified last week in a congressional deposition behind closed doors.\n\nHill told lawmakers that Bolton said Giuliani, the president's point-man on Ukraine, was 'a hand grenade who's going to blow everyone up,' according to an account in The New York Times.\n\nCongressional Democrats are scheduled to hear from Alexander Vindman, the White House National Security Council's top Ukraine expert, on Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kathryn Wheelbarger, the acting assistant secretary of defense for international security, is scheduled to testify as are two State Department Ukraine specialists - Catherine Croft and Christopher Anderson.\n\nTim Morrison, a top White House adviser on Russia and Europe, is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nHe is also of deep interest to Democrats.\n\nBill Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, mentioned him frequently in his deposition to lawmakers last week, discussing phone calls he had with Morrison that described the Ukraine effort led by Rudy Giuliani.", "description": "Charles Kupperman, a former deputy to John Bolton, will not testify before Congress as he is waiting on the courts to tell him whether or not he can speak to the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/12/20277646-0-image-a-6_1572264453647.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
