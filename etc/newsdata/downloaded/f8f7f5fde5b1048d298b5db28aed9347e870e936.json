Both sides of AT&T\u2019s TV business were to blame: AT&T TV Now, the company\u2019s streaming service, has been losing subscribers since the end of 2018, while AT&T\u2019s traditional TV services saw already large losses grow by more than 3x year over year.\n\nTraditional TV businesses have been struggling across the industry, so AT&T isn\u2019t alone in dealing with growing subscriber losses. But the company finds itself in a bad spot with its would-be replacement option \u2014 AT&T TV Now \u2014 already shrinking after just a few years on the market. The service, originally called DirecTV Now, peaked at around 1.9 million subscribers in the third quarter of last year, but it\u2019s seen net losses in the tens or hundreds of thousands in the four quarters since. It\u2019s suffered from customer complaints and bad reviews since launch.\n\n\u201cfaster-growing, more profitable, focused and shareholder-friendly company\u201d\n\nA large activist investor firm, Elliott Management, bought a stake in AT&T last quarter and issued a scathing letter particularly criticizing AT&T\u2019s recent efforts in TV and entertainment. The firm said AT&T\u2019s acquisition of DirecTV was poorly timed, coming at the \u201cabsolute peak of the linear TV market.\u201d It also said that after almost two years of ownership, AT&T had \u201cyet to articulate a clear strategic rationale\u201d for its purchase of Time Warner, which includes HBO, Warner Bros., and CNN.\n\nIn today\u2019s earnings release, AT&T makes a number of projections and announcements that seek to appease Elliott and improve its outlook. For one, it says that AT&T\u2019s current CEO and chairman, Randall Stephenson, will remain on the job through 2020, but that succession planning will begin then and the CEO and chairman roles will be split to remove some of the position\u2019s power.\n\nAT&T also issued a three-year outlook, which includes paying off all of the debt it took on to buy Time Warner, making no major acquisitions, selling off unimportant assets, adding two new directors to its board, and just generally making more money, which is ultimately what Elliott wanted. Exactly how AT&T will make that money isn\u2019t really clear beyond the company saying its numbers will get better. (There\u2019s some talk about \u201csynergies\u201d with WarnerMedia and \u201corganic growth opportunities.\u201d)\n\nAfter initially issuing a cool response to Elliott\u2019s letter, Stephenson now says he finds Elliott\u2019s team to be \u201cconstructive and helpful.\u201d Elliott issued a new letter this morning in support of AT&T\u2019s announced changes, saying the steps move it toward being a \u201cfaster-growing, more profitable, focused and shareholder-friendly company.\u201d", "description": "AT&T\u2019s TV business took an enormous hit in Q3 2019, losing nearly 1.4 million subscribers. In response to a major activist investor, AT&T also announced plans to focus its business over the next three years, including no major new acquisitions.", "authors": ["Jacob Kastrenakes", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IzojXk4f9MzzwbyRZinGMcHL7Pg=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10690893/acastro_180322_1777_0001.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
