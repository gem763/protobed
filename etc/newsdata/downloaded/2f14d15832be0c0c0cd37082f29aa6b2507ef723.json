(AP) - The historic Oregon Supreme Court - the oldest government building on the Capitol Mall - is set to empty out in October for two years of renovations including earthquake reinforcements and safety upgrades.\n\nServices at the century-old court building, which includes the Oregon Supreme Court and the Oregon Court of Appeals courtroom, the State of Oregon Law Library, the Oregon Judicial Department and Appellate Court Records, will be spread to different locations throughout Salem.\n\nIt will cost about $51 million and displace 56 employees, according to Oregon Judicial Department spokesman Todd Sprague.\n\n\u201cThis has been the seat of the Supreme Court and the home of the judicial branch in Oregon for over 100 years,\u201d Oregon Supreme Court Justice Thomas Balmer said. \u201cWith these upgrades, we can ensure that it will be our home and the locus for the Supreme Court and focal point of the entire courts system for another 100 years.\u201d\n\nOver the past year, staff members have hauled tens of thousands of volumes from its law library collection to new locations.\n\nThe second-floor library has been home to historic documents that date to the 15th century.\n\nState Law Librarian Cathryn Bowie estimated they used 8,000 boxes during the move, sometimes individually wrapping the centuries-old rare books before personally escorting them out of the building.\n\nMany have ornate hand-lettering, marbled paper and oiled-leather covers. Some legal ledgers date to before 1859 when Oregon became a state.\n\n\u201cSome of them are gorgeous,\u201d Bowie said. \u201cThey\u2019re works of art.\u201d\n\nRich history comes to light\n\nBowie walked through the marbled hallways of the Supreme Court building detailing the history of each room - a gap in the ceiling said to be haunted, a vault used to store rare books, a crate of books left unopened since 1914, and a door in a justice\u2019s chamber that literally leads to nowhere.\n\nConstruction on the three-story building was completed in 1914.\n\nIt was built in the Beaux Arts-style, with white, glazed terracotta tiles, flat roof, Ionic columns and ornamental architecture reminiscent of the former Capitol building that burned down in 1935.\n\nBefore then, the Supreme Court assembled in the Capitol. Had they still been there in 1935, the court and law library would\u2019ve been lost in the fire, Bowie said.\n\nAfter receiving funding from the legislature in 1911, construction began. The building cost $320,000.\n\nThe interior features an ornate spiral staircase, marble floors and an iconic stained glass skylight of the state seal of Oregon above the courtroom.\n\nAfter the ceiling was damaged in the 1962 Columbus Day Storm, the skylight, made by premier artisans at Povey Brothers Art Glass Works, was restored with many of the original pieces.\n\nWhen the sun is just right, the opalescent glass of the skylight occasionally lights the courtroom up in an \u201cabsolutely gorgeous\u201d orange blaze, Bowie said.\n\nThe intimacy and the elegance of the courtroom speak to the important work that goes on there, Balmer said.\n\nBowie, who\u2019s worked in the building for 16 years, got married in the courtroom.\n\nThe airy, high ceilings and carefully-crafted architecture lend a special beauty to a building.\n\n\u201cIt gives stature and a kind of grace to the Supreme Court,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel it when you walk in the building.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, a few upgrades are needed. When the court opened, women could not serve on juries or didn\u2019t typically act as attorneys so the availability of women\u2019s restrooms was limited. Seismic and electrical upgrades are also sorely needed, Bowie said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to interfere with the look and feel of this beautiful area,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unusual for people to personify a building. You want to protect it.\u201d\n\nNewest justice gets \u2018broom closet\u2019\n\nThe first floor houses the Appellate Court Records, and the law library in located on the second floor. The Supreme and Appeals courts share a courtroom on the third floor, where justices\u2019 chambers are also located.\n\nAccording to the Oregon Historical Society\u2019s Oregon Encyclopedia, the smallest chamber, known as \u201cthe broom closest,\u201d is traditionally assigned to the newest justice.\n\nThe rumor was that the canvas awnings that previously shaded the windows were removed after a justice\u2019s cigarette ash set one ablaze, Bowie said.\n\nThe original furnishings in the courtroom a note penciled in a drawer of the chief justice\u2019s desk reading, \u201cFeb. 14, 1914. This building first occupied by the Supreme Court\u201d followed by a list of the justices\u2019 names.\n\nSince then, every justice to serve the court has etched their name in the drawer.\n\nThe first session of court was held on the 55th anniversary of Oregon\u2019s statehood.\n\nOver the years, several landmark cases involving the death penalty, free speech, punitive damages from cigarette companies, and obscenity have been argued in the court.\n\nDuring renovations in 1981, the mahogany-filled courtroom was refurbished with Italian silk paneling, hand-painted carpet and new furniture built by inmates.\n\nEarthquake retrofit needed\n\nBeginning in November, the building will undergo renovations to preserve and protect the historic structure and improve safety, function, efficiency, and access for years to come, Sprague said.\n\nThe project will include earthquake reinforcement and upgrades to heating, cooling, electrical, technology, and plumbing systems to meet modern standards.\n\n\u201cIt needs a seismic upgrade,\u201d Balmer said. \u201cIf, when we have the big earthquake, the current building would not survive.\u201d\n\nPlumbing, some of which is still the original plumbing, also needs to be replaced. Balmer said staff typically don\u2019t drink the water as a safety precaution due to possible lead.\n\nHe anticipates that heating, ventilation and electrical upgrades will make the building more energy-efficient.\n\nRenovations are expected to take two years.\n\nIt\u2019s time to bring those parts of the building up the 21st-century level help make it last into the 22nd century, Balmer said.\n\nThe history of the building wasn\u2019t always appreciated. A former justice was quoted in a May 1950 article in The Oregon Statesman calling it \u201coutmoded\u201d and saying its proximity to the railroad tracks interfered with the functions of the court. He requested funds from the Legislature to build a new Supreme Court building.\n\nFortunately, Balmer said, the building was not razed. Upgrades were made, and appreciation for the history and architecture grew.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of the men and women who have served as judges and come and gone \u2026 it is just a critical part of this branch of government,\u201d Balmer said. \u201cThis is its home. This is where people will keep doing the work of the courts and applying the law for another 100 years in this building.\u201d\n\nIt feels good to be part of that, he said.\n\nMoves roll out in October\n\nStarting Oct. 4, the Oregon Supreme Court, the Appellate Commissioner\u2019s Office and the Appellate Court Services Division, which includes Appellate Court Records, the State of Oregon Law Library, and Oregon Judicial Department Publications, will move to a temporary location at 2850 Broadway St. NE.\n\nOffices will be re-open for business on Oct. 7. The mailing address for court business will remain the same.\n\nAnd starting Nov. 1, most Supreme Court oral arguments will be held in the temporary location.\n\nThe State of Oregon Law Library will be housed at the temporary location in a reduced physical capacity.\n\nThough physical materials will still be available, there may be some delay as many resources are being stored off-site, Sprague said.\n\nPublic tours of the building were halted leading up to the move but will be resumed after the renovation is completed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The historic Oregon Supreme Court - the oldest government building on the Capitol Mall - is set to empty out in October for two years of renovations including earthquake reinforcements and safety upgrades.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Whitney Woodworth"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
