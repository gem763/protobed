While this could ultimately produce smartphone cameras with no bump\n\nThe lens was developed by engineers at the University of Utah who believe it could be used to flatten the loathe camera bumps, in addition to added to drones and night vision cameras for military purposes.\n\nCo-author or the paper electrical and computer engineering graduate student, Monjurul Meem said 'our lens is a hundred times lighter and a thousand times thinner, but the performance can be as good as conventional lenses,'\n\nA conventional curved lens takes light that bounces off an object and bends it before it ultimately reaches the camera sensor that forms the digital picture.\n\nBut this new lens has many microstructures, each bending the light in the correct direction at the sensor.\n\nWhile this could ultimately produce smartphone cameras with no bump, like the triple-camera system on the iPhone Pro handsets, it could also give them the ability to take thermal imaging to look for heat signatures\n\nThe team has developed a fabrication process with a new type of polymer along with algorithms that can calculate the geometry of these microstructures.\n\n'You can think of these microstructures as very small pixels of a lens,' Menon explains. 'They're not a lens by themselves but all working together to act as a lens.'\n\nThe result is a lens that is flat instead of curved and more than 20 times thinner than a human hair with the added capability of being used in thermal imaging to see objects in the dark.\n\nWhile this could ultimately produce smartphone cameras with no bump, it could also give them the ability to take thermal imaging to look for heat signatures.\n\nBut a more immediate use for this technology would allow lighter military drones to fly longer for night missions or to map forest fires or look for victims of natural disasters.\n\nAnd soldiers in the field could carry much lighter night vision cameras for a longer duration.\n\nThis optical lens could have saved Apple from a lot of criticism with the release of its iPhone 11, as the camera was ridiculed by fans on social media for looking similar to a coconut with its three protruding lenses\n\nMenon says this new lens could also be cheaper to manufacture because the design allows them to create them out of plastic instead of glass.\n\nThis optical lens could have saved Apple from a lot of criticism with the release of its iPhone 11, as the camera was ridiculed by fans on social media for looking similar to a coconut with its three protruding lenses.\n\nApple boasts that the cameras will allow fans better photo capabilities than ever before but the design has left fans distinctly unimpressed.\n\nSome users said the camera arrangement is triggering their fear of clusters of small holes \u2013 called trypophobia, which could be set off by images like these\n\nOne claimed that the three cameras made the phone resemble a coconut while another compared the design to a bowling ball.\n\nOthers suffering from trypophobia \u2013 a fear of clusters of small holes \u2013 say the small grouping of lenses has triggered their anxieties.\n\nSeveral compared the device to aliens with a few even posting photos of the camera re-imagined as kitchen hobs.\n\nFor people with trypophobia, the new design is a potential nightmare and several Apple fans shared their horror on Twitter.\n\nTrypophobia is a fear or aversion to the sight of clusters of small holes.\n\nOne fan wrote: 'The new iPhone is creeping me TF out with the 3 little cameras #Trypophobia.'", "description": "A new lens could get rid of the unsightly camera bump on the back of smartphones.
