Mike Parson to assign Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers to help out in the city. The analysis found that 584 children have been killed in the city since 1990, and that 418 of those were in the predominantly black north St. Louis.\n\n\"Even if not another bullet went into someone's body in St. Louis, nobody else gets hurt, our children have collectively experienced enough violence for a lifetime,\" said Washington University trauma surgeon Laurie Punch, an expert on gun violence.\n\nEmma Harrington knows the pain all too well. Two of those child victims called her \"granny.\"\n\nHarrington's house was full of kids in 1991, when two of her daughters and six of their children lived with her. One of the grandchildren was 7-year-old Aaron, a high-achieving second-grader.\n\nIn October 1991, Aaron was playing with four other children in the front room when a shot was fired into the home. Aaron was struck in the heart.\n\n\"I got shot! I got shot!\" the little boy yelled out. He quickly collapsed. He was dead by the time the adults got him to the hospital.\n\nThree people were soon arrested. A 17-year-old pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. A 15-year-old who police believe fired the fatal shot was acquitted at trial. Prosecutors dropped the case against the third suspect, a 16-year-old.\n\nWitnesses told detectives that the shooting stemmed from an ongoing gang feud.\n\nHarrington thought about moving after Aaron was killed, but never saw much of a choice.\n\n\"Where am I going?\" she said. \"When you're poor, you're not going anywhere.\"\n\nWithin a couple years of Aaron's death, Harrington was raising 10 children \u2014 nine grandchildren along with Derrion Williams, the child of her daughter's friend who was born while his mother was in prison. Harrington didn't want the child to end up in foster care, so she picked him up from prison five hours after his birth and raised him. He called her granny.\n\nIn September 2008, when Derrion was 16, he was riding in a car with two other teens when another car pulled up next to them in a gas station and shot him. He was one of 16 children and teens killed in St. Louis that year.\n\nThe deaths of the children \"wrecked us,\" Harrington said. \"It really did. Something like that destroys a family on down the line.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: St. Louis Post-Dispatch, http://www.stltoday.com", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
