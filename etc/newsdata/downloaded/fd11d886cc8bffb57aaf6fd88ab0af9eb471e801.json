What's on your Saturday breakfast menu? Daniel.\"\n\nThe mistake that Daniel made here is that it isn't actually Saturday at all, but people weren't about to let the truth get in the way of a great idea.\n\nOne reply to the tweet read: \"I didn't turn in for work today believing it was Saturday. You've cost me my job for an unannounced absence.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"I would like a Sainsbury's pen and/or pencil as recompense. You have 2 years to get back to me.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Thank you for giving people the excuse they need to miss work today, comrade Daniel.\"\n\nSome of the replies to the tweet, which remains live on the account hours later , were just plain funny.\n\nWith Daniel seemingly nowhere to be found among the mayhem he created, it was left to fellow Sainsbury's tweeter Brandon to clear up the mess as other brand accounts piled in.\n\nSpecsavers came back with their requirements for a full English which included sausage, bacon, fried egg, eye test and beans.\n\nTesco jumped at the chance to offer Daniel a jar Nescafe Gold to wake him up, which the rivals helpfully pointed out is now on offer at their store.\n\nSky told Brandon to ask time-travelling Daniel two questions: 1) What happened in parliament? 2) Did England win the rugby?\n\nBrandon, probably exhausted by now, responded to say Daniel had 'no idea' what was going to happen to the future of our country, and England and Australia would draw tomorrow's World Cup quarter-final, leaving the entire tournament in as much of a mess as his calendar.\n\nSainsbury's has been contacted for comment.\n\nNever change, internet.", "description": "Sainsbury's employee Daniel got a little ahead of himself with his well-intentioned tweet", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Nurphoto Via Getty Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20647725.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sainsbury-And-Asda-Agree-Merger.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
