You want to have less mosquitos, but mosquitoes with Wolbachia.\n\n\"If there is a vaccine you can use it in conjunction with that ... it has to be a combination.\"\n\nBrazil is one of several countries holding trials of the so-called Wolbachia method, which began in Australia in 2011, to tackle the virus that infects tens of millions around the world every year.\n\nThe self-sustaining process does not involve genetic modification (GM), which has been tested in Brazil and elsewhere.\n\nIn one GM trial, thousands of male mosquitoes carrying a \"self-limiting gene\" designed by British biotech company Oxitec were released in the eastern Brazilian state of Bahia between 2013 and 2015.\n\nThe number of viable offspring fell dramatically, suppressing the wild mosquito population by an average of 70 percent compared with before the release, Oxitec found.\n\nBut mosquito numbers rebounded after the project ended.\n\nMoreira says previous attempts to wipe out mosquito populations have failed.\n\n\"There are too many (mosquitoes),\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n- Fresh blood is best -\n\nThousands of bacteria-carrying mosquitoes at Fiocruz institute are the descendants of insects originally infected with Wolbachia at Australia's Monash University.\n\nResearchers there took the bacteria from fruit flies and injected it into mosquito eggs using a very fine needle.\n\nThe Brazilian insects are kept in small boxes in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room.\n\nDuring their brief lives, which can be as long as 100 days in the lab, females have sex with their male counterparts multiple times.\n\nAfter mating, the females dine on human blood supplied by a blood bank, and then deposit their eggs on the surface of water held in plastic containers.\n\nThe eggs, which inherit Wolbachia from the female, are harvested and transferred to large test tubes.\n\nOnly female mosquitoes consume blood, which they need to produce eggs, Catia Cabral, supervisor of the insectary, tells AFP during a recent visit.\n\nAny blood type is ok, but fresh is always best.\n\n\"She is going to prefer 1,000 times more the blood from my arm, but she can't choose here so she has to eat this blood,\" says Cabral, showing AFP a bag of blood from a bank.\n\nWithin two weeks, the infected offspring have grown into adults and are ready for release.\n\nBrazil's health ministry plans to expand the program to municipalities in other parts of the country to see if similar results can be produced in different environments.\n\nBut state and federal government budget cuts mean no more Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes will be released in Rio or Niteroi after December, Moreira says.", "description": "Dengue-resistant mosquitoes breed in a Rio de Janeiro laboratory, producing offspring infected with bacteria packing a punch in the fight against the deadly virus, which is exploding across Brazil this year.
