UBER 0.21% and Lyft Inc., LYFT 0.99% which rely on gig workers as drivers. But it might also reshape work in professions including construction, trucking, adult entertainment and more.\n\n\u201cIt will give a lot of employers pause,\u201d says Veena Dubal, associate professor of law at the University of California, Hastings, who adds that the bill \u201ccreates a presumption of employee status.\u201d\n\nEmployers that want to treat someone as a contractor will need to prove that the person is free from the company\u2019s control and direction, that the work falls outside the organization\u2019s usual business and that the contractor works independently in the type of work being performed. By hiring someone as an employee instead of a contract worker, companies would then be subject to payroll taxes, minimum-wage laws, workers\u2019 compensation claims and unemployment insurance.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think other states will follow California\u2019s lead and pass similar legislation? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe legislation exempts numerous professions, including physicians, attorneys, architects, insurance salespeople, accountants and real-estate agents, among others. But in fields that rely heavily on independent contractors, such as language interpretation, many questions remain.\n\nKarim Bayumi, a 40-year-old who drives five or six days a week for Uber and Lyft around Los Angeles, called the passage of the legislation exciting. \u201cWe have been misclassified for a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are being treated as employees but not getting the benefits or protections that come with it.\u201d\n\nMr. Bayumi, who is on the organizing committee for Rideshare Drivers United, a group trying to unionize Lyft and Uber drivers, says he recently suffered a hernia and will need surgery, preventing him from driving. As an employee, he would be entitled to benefits such as workers\u2019 compensation and other protections that he says would give him peace of mind. \u201cI don\u2019t have high hopes of these companies doing the right thing, but when the law is forcing them to, then they would have to comply,\u201d he says.\n\nMany of the roughly 70,000 owner-operators of big trucks in the state could be negatively affected even though they have invested tens of thousands of dollars in their rigs and equipment, according to the California Trucking Association, which sought unsuccessfully to carve out exemptions in the bill. Although many U.S. trucking firms hire their own company drivers, most also rely heavily on independent truckers who own or lease their equipment to supplement their operations.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has said he would sign the bill, which would go into effect Jan. 1. Experts are weighing what the broader economic impact of the legislation will be. Uber has said it won\u2019t need to reclassify its workers and vowed to keep fighting. Lyft issued a memo to employees saying some changes might be coming.\n\nCalifornia-based interpreters and translators do their jobs in hospitals, courtrooms, technology companies and beyond, often working as contractors for multiple language agencies, said Barry Slaughter Olsen, an interpreter who works in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian.\n\nMr. Olsen, who is also a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said interpreters determine their own hours, pick their own jobs, set their rates and appreciate the flexibility of freelancing for multiple clients and companies. He said many translation agencies wouldn\u2019t be able to hire the contractors as employees, even on a part-time basis.\n\n\u201cWe are freelancers by choice,\u201d Mr. Olsen said. \u201cI cannot see how being a part-time employee of six or seven different agencies or entities is feasible.\u201d\n\nLorena Ortiz Schneider, who has worked as a Spanish-language interpreter and translator for the past 27 years, agreed. She owns a small translation company near Santa Barbara that works with about 25 contract workers. Her firm might not be able to hire all those people as employees, particularly those specializing in what are known as long-tail languages\u2014such as Hmong\u2014where there is typically less work, she said. Among her peers, Ms. Schneider said there is much uncertainty and confusion about exactly how the law might play out.\n\n\u201cPeople are freaked out. People don\u2019t know where to turn, where to get answers,\u201d Ms. Schneider said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of distress.\u201d\n\nFrom the Archives For an increasing number of Americans, a patchwork of gig work is the norm. Others are now known as independent workers, because they take second jobs through digital platforms such as Uber or Etsy to make ends meet. But nearly all face the challenges of inconsistent income and access to benefits. (Originally published March 21, 2018)\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t clear exactly how many gig workers are in California, government data released last year show contract work nationally is relatively small. The fraction of workers employed as independent contractors was 6.9% in May 2017, down from 7.4% in February 2005, according to U.S. Labor Department figures.\n\nThe data overall showed more than 90% of U.S. workers held traditional jobs, meaning workers were on the payroll of the company for which they performed work. That was little changed from 2005.\n\nStill, the California bill is considered a threat to gig workers at companies such as Uber and Lyft. \u201cThe gig economy is set up for extreme flexibility for employees and employers,\u201d said David Shulman, senior economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast. \u201cThis is going to create a great deal of friction in that system.\u201d\n\nWinemakers are also questioning how the law will affect them. Growers in California work with contractors and outside firms to transport their grapes or to help them study and develop vineyards, analyzing soil conditions, studying weather patterns and predicting in-demand varietals of grapes, said Michael Miiller, director of government relations at the California Association of Winegrape Growers, an industry group.\n\nMany growers worry whether they will need to employ such people as contractors, Mr. Miiller said. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned, and they\u2019re confused. They want to comply with the law in every way, but they\u2019re not quite sure how this works,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Miiller says he believes the bill will require continuing legislation over the next 10 years to \u201caddress unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nStill, plenty of groups support the bill and say it will help workers. AM Davies, a Los Angeles-based board member of Soldiers of Pole, an organization working to unionize strippers, said the law will force many clubs to employ dancers as employees, not contractors. The bill \u201cvalidates our jobs as actual work,\u201d Ms. Davies said. \u201cThis puts us on the same playing field as other employees and workers and proves that this is an actual job. We show up at a certain time, we get paid, and we leave at a certain time. We\u2019re not the scourge of the earth as people treat us. We are workers, we are a workforce, we are not going away and we demand rights just as every other human being who is a worker.\u201d\n\n\u2014Sarah Chaney, Jennifer Smith and Alejandro Lazo contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Chip Cutter at chip.cutter@wsj.com", "description": "A landmark California employment bill that passed Wednesday could have implications for companies in fields far beyond technology and ride-hailing.", "authors": ["Chip Cutter", "Chip.Cutter Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106704/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
