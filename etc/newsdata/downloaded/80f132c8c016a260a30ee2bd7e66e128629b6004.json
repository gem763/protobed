Let\u2019s take a look at them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdnan Syed\n\nThe most obvious suspect is Adnan Syed himself.\n\nSyed and Lee started dating at the beginning of 1998 but by December they had broken up and she was dating another man.\n\nThe 39-year-old has been behind bars since the age of 18 for Lee\u2019s death and was looked into as a suspect three days after Lee\u2019s body was found.\n\nLee disappeared on January 13, 1999 and her family reported her missing after she failed to pick up her younger cousin from daycare around 3.15pm.\n\nShe had gone to school that day and had been seen by a number of people leaving at the end of the day.\n\nJay Wilds said he heard Syed confess to the murder, but this information conflicts a fellow student\u2019s claim that she saw him in the library at school on the afternoon of Lee\u2019s disappearance.\n\nAdnan Syed has been charged with Lee\u2019s murder (Picture: HBO)\n\nJay Wilds and Adnan Syed\n\nJay Wilds was a key witness during the trial and his statement was crucial to prosecuting Syed.\n\nWilds had Syed\u2019s phone on the day of Lee\u2019s murder and he initially denied any knowledge of the crime.\n\nAfter some time, Wilds told police that Syed had shown him Lee\u2019s body in the carpark of a Best Buy and that they both buried the body in Leakin Park at around 7pm later that evening.\n\nJay Wilds was a friend of Syed\u2019s (Picture: HBO)\n\nDuring his interview, however, Wilds frequently seemed to lose his way which was marked by knocking and tapping sounds. After hearing these sounds, he seemed to remember what happened and insisted that Syed carried out the murder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to attorney Susan Simpson, the tapping was evidence that the police were feeding Wilds with elements of his supposed story.\n\nIn a statement shared in 2019, Wilds said that his statement regarding seeing the body at Best Buy came from the police.\n\nWas Wilds more involved with the murder than he let on?\n\nAlonzo Sellers found Hae Min Lee\u2019s body\n\nAlonzo Sellers\n\nAlonzo Sellers found Lee\u2019s body in Leakin Park as he made a toilet stop on February 9 1999.\n\nSellers told police he\u2019d been drinking a 22-ounce Budweiser as he drove back to a school where he worked as a janitor, when he pulled over to use the bathroom.\n\nHae Min Lee was murdered in 1999\n\n(Picture: Woodlawn High School)\n\n\u2018I had to go to the bathroom so I pulled over and I went further in the woods so no one could see me,\u2019 he said in the series.\n\n\u2018I walked around through the bushes and everything and I got back that way and I was getting ready to urinate when I looked down I seen something that looked like hair, something was covered by the dirt.\n\n\u2018And I looked real good again, and that\u2019s when I seen what looked like a foot.\u2019\n\nSellers reportedly had a criminal past, but could he have killed Lee?\n\nTalking about whether Sellers found Lee\u2019s body the way he said he did, Decetive Darryl Massey said in the documentary: \u2018I\u2019m not going to support that he didn\u2019t \u2013 don\u2019t think he wasn\u2019t looked at.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I certainly understood some prior documented issues.\u2019\n\nCould Alonzo have murdered Lee?\n\nRonald Lee Moore\n\nRonald Lee Moore wasn\u2019t a suspect in Lee\u2019s murder until 2014 when The University of Virginia\u2019s Innocence Project identified him.\n\nMoore took his own life in prison\n\nMoore was released from prison 10 day before Lee was killed and 11 months after her death, another Korean woman, Annelise Hyang Suk Lee, was killed.\n\nIt was uncovered through DNA evidence that he had murdered Suk Lee by blunt force trauma and strangulation.\n\n\u2018In some ways, he was ideal because he had been released from prison and fit the timeframe for Hae\u2019s murder because he had been out for 10 days when she was murdered,\u2019 Deirdre Enright, head of the Innocence Project, told TIME.\n\nMoore took his own life in prison in 2012 after being arrested for charges unrelated to either murder.\n\nThe Case of Adnan Syed is available to watch on Sky Crime.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
