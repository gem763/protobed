But artificial intelligence is one area of undeniable potential. And in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) investors are being offered a more intelligent approach to cash in on the artificial intelligence stocks trend. Let me explain.\n\nWill cryptocurrencies led by Bitcoin ever really be a thing? And what is the potential for an industry like cannabis? Just as important, how will investing today in a market leader like Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) look like a year from now or even five or ten years out? Nobody, and I mean nobody knows. But artificial intelligence is very different.\n\nArtificial intelligence or AI is already seamlessly changing the way we see things, work and go about our lives. That last movie on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) which was recommended by Netflix and which you simply loved? AI played a hand. At a business level, AI\u2019s machine learning is widely-used to scour through massive troves of data enabling algorithms to recognize otherwise indiscernible patterns and calculate stronger decisions and predictions. As I said, artificial intelligence is everywhere these days.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut what about investing in artificial intelligence stocks? There are no real pure plays, of notice anyways, on this growing technology despite an estimated 44% jump in spending on AI systems to nearly $36 billion this year. But profiting smartly from this boom is still very much possible.\n\nIn the following let\u2019s look at large cap outfits Microsoft, UPS and Palo Alto Networks. These three well-entrenched market leaders offer a diversified approach to investing in artificial intelligence stocks\u2014and right now are presenting today\u2019s investors\u2019 buyable price charts for the long haul.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft is the first of our three AI stocks to buy. Along with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), no conversation regarding artificial intelligence stocks would be complete without mentioning MSFT stock. These diversified tech giants have continued to grow on the back of AI. In Microsoft\u2019s case the company is pushing the technology into its cloud computing business and consumer offerings.\n\nTechnically and unlike GOOGL or AMZN shares, MSFT stock is also unequivocally demonstrating bullish strength on the price chart. Microsoft has put together a sturdy basing pattern of around three months which has successfully tested existing uptrend and lateral price support. The price action has MSFT stock in a position of leadership within the broader market and coupled with a supportive-looking bullish stochastics crossover, makes this an artificial intelligence stock to buy on a breakout.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nUnited Parcel Service is the next of our AI stocks to purchase. UPS stock may not be the first name you think of when it comes to investing in artificial intelligence stocks. Yet using AI to drive efficiencies is huge for UPS and increasingly important in gaining a market edge throughout its business.\n\nTechnically, UPS is also an artificial intelligence stock that\u2019s ready to deliver big-time profits to investors.\n\nAfter recently clearing downtrend and Fibonacci resistance and testing the former barriers for support, shares have broken out of a five-week long consolidation. The price action has put UPS stock into the upper right-hand side of its 20-month long, irregular cup-shaped base and in position for purchase today.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Riding the next big thing to catch Wall Street's fancy can be tough.
