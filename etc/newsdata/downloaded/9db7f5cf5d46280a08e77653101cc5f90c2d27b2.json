REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nBut some players are questioning the accuracy of the tour\u2019s testing procedure, and have sent their drivers back to their various manufacturers for re-testing.\n\nThe non-conforming drivers are from across the manufacturing spectrum, including major brands such as Titleist, TaylorMade and Cobra, two insiders with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nIt is believed that Corey Conners, Robert Streb, Jason Dufner, Michael Thompson and Mark Hubbard were among those whose drivers did not pass the test.\n\nThe tour has begun random testing of 30 drivers at tournaments this season.\n\nThere is no suggestions manufacturers are making clubs that are not within the game\u2019s rules, which limit the spring-like effect when the club face makes contact with the ball.\n\nBut drivers can become non-conforming over time through normal use as the club \u201ccreeps\u201d beyond the allowed limits.\n\nThe tests are performed on a pendulum device calibrated by the United States Golf Association (USGA) in accordance with test protocols.\n\nCHARACTERISTIC TIME\n\nThe device measures what is known as \u201ccharacteristic time\u201d or CT, the amount of time, measured in microseconds, that there is contact between the club face of a driver and the ball used in the testing apparatus at the moment of impact.\n\nThe players whose drivers were deemed non-conforming this week had to use replacement clubs at the tournament in Napa, though they did so on an honor system as all the testing was done pre-tournament.\n\nThe issue first made headlines at this year\u2019s British Open when world number 10 Xander Schauffele\u2019s driver was deemed non-conforming in a test conducted by the R&A, the game\u2019s governing body outside of North America.\n\nAn equipment manufacturer representative on Sunday explained the process by which drivers can become non-conforming.\n\n\u201cThey all start off legal and then the face starts to deform and the CT number increases,\u201d he told Reuters, explaining that even non-conforming clubs confer little if any advantage.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate to higher ball speed,\u201d said the representative.\n\n\u201cThis will become a non-topic next year.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, several players whose drivers tested as non-conforming have contacted the tour\u2019s point man on the issue, Tyler Dennis, questioning the results and demanding greater transparency.\n\nAccording to an insider, Dennis has declined to discuss specifics of the results with players, citing the need for confidentiality.\n\n\u201cWe will not be commenting publicly on items such as the PGA Tour tournaments scheduled for testing or results from testing,\u201d Joel Schuchmann, vice president of communications, said in an email to Reuters.\n\nIn a Sept. 3 memo to players and manufacturers, the Tour said: \u201cThrough our experience in testing equipment on the PGA Tour over many years, we know that PGA Tour players and the equipment manufacturers who support them go to great lengths to ensure that all equipment in play conforms to the rules.\u201d", "description": "Several players were deemed to be using non-conforming drivers at this week's Safeway Open in California as the new PGA Tour testing procedure swung into full gear, Reuters has learned.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190929&t=2&i=1435305848&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0U2-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
