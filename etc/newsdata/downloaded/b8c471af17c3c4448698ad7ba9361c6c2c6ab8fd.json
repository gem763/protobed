Martin, representing himself, maintained he was innocent.\n\nNewton, prior to the sentencing, told the judge his family was still unnerved by the burglaries, and to have no mercy on Martin.\n\n'It would be impossible for me to articulate what happened to our home, our family and those things we believed in prior to this happening,' he said, reported the Review-Journal.\n\n'I'm still angry,' Newton told Villani. 'And I realize there should be some compassion. I have none for this defendant'.\n\nMartin's public defender, Will Ewing, conceded during opening statements that his client's face was captured on a doorbell security camera at a neighboring home the night of the first Newton home robbery.\n\nThe Newtons were in New York at the time.\n\nBut the burglars, who 10 days later apparently tried to pry open a safe in Newton's dressing room, had bandanas on their faces and Ewing told jurors during his client's trial that only a vague video image of someone with a similar body shape and size on the Newton home stairway might tie Martin to the break-in the Newtons interrupted.\n\nNewton's wife, Kathleen, told Villani that the couple's teenage daughter, Lauren, continues to suffer from nightmares about the burglaries, reports the Review-Journal.\n\n'My family's lives will never be the same because of the criminal actions of this defendant,' she said. 'Fear is a terrible way to live'.\n\nHer singer husband commented to a reporter after the sentencing that he now sleeps with a 'weapon by his side, because of the burglaries,' according to the Review-Journal's report.\n\nWayne Newton had told the judge that he did have compassion for Martin's mother, 'because with the holidays coming up, to think that she gave birth to that (Martin) has to be something that haunts her for the rest of her life'.", "description": "Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton says he sleeps with a gun after burglars robbed his home twice, including once when the Danke Schoen singer and his family walked in on the crime", "authors": ["Ralph R.
