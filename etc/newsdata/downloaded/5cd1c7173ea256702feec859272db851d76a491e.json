The more qubits that can be strung together, the vastly more powerful a quantum computer becomes.\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: Quantum researchers need to cool the qubits to close to absolute zero to limit vibration \u2014 or \u201cnoise\u201d \u2014 that causes errors to creep into their calculations. It\u2019s in this extremely challenging task that the research team at Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, has made significant progress.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai compared the achievement to building the first rocket to leave the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and touch the edge of space, an advance that brought interplanetary travel into the realm of the possible.\n\n\u201cFor those of us working in science and technology, it\u2019s the \u2018hello world\u2019 moment we\u2019ve been waiting for \u2014 the most meaningful milestone to date in the quest to date to make quantum computing a reality,\u201d Pichai wrote in a blog.\n\nRANDOM TASK\n\nGoogle developed a microprocessor, named Sycamore, that packs a total of 54 qubits. Measuring about 10 mm across, it is made using aluminum and indium parts sandwiched between two silicon wafers.\n\nIn their experiment, the researchers were able to get 53 of the qubits \u2014 connected to each other in a lattice pattern \u2014 to interact in a so-called quantum state.\n\nThey then set the quantum computer a complex task to detect patterns in a series of seemingly random numbers. It solved the problem in 3 minutes and 20 seconds. They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer \u2014 the most powerful in the world today \u2014 to solve.\n\n\u201cThis dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm,\u201d wrote the research team, led by Google AI\u2019s Frank Arute.\n\nHOLD ON A QUBIT\n\nWhile the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT\u2019s William D. Oliver comparing its findings in Nature to the Wright brothers\u2019 first flights, skeptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.\n\nResearchers at IBM, Google\u2019s main quantum computing rival, said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days, with greater fidelity \u2014 or accuracy.\n\nThey also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.\n\n\u201cQuantum computers will never reign \u2018supreme\u2019 over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,\u201d Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog.\n\nTorsten Siebert, manager of the quantum computing research program at Germany\u2019s Fraunhofer Society, said Google had achieved impressive fidelity in its experiment involving a large number of qubits.\n\nUltimately, he said, quantum computers were likely to work in harness with classical computers \u2014 with each playing to its strengths.\n\n\u201cWe certainly share IBM\u2019s concerns about the general concept of \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 in relation to a truly application-orientated advancement of the field,\u201d he said, adding progress was likely to be achieved through such hybrid combinations.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "Google solved a complex problem in minutes with a quantum computer that would take today's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/sundar-pichai.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
