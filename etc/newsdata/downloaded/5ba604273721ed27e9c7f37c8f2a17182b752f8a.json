Trump says US \u2018secured the oil\u2019 in Syria, causes confusion", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the US has \u201csecured the oil\u201d in Syria has set Twitter on fire, from speculation he will keep troops there to accusations he was only ever interested in oil rather than fighting terrorism.\n\nPraising the ceasefire negotiated with Turkey on Thursday, Trump tweeted that everything was going well, adding that captured Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) terrorists were \u201cdouble secured\u201d by Turkish and Kurdish forces, but \u201cthe US has secured the oil.\u201d\n\n.....this thinking years ago. Instead, it was always held together with very weak bandaids, & in an artificial manner. There is good will on both sides & a really good chance for success. The U.S. has secured the Oil, & the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds & Turkey.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2019\n\nJournalists, pundits, think-tank experts and the president\u2019s critics in general have zeroed in on that \u201ccurious element\u201d in the thread, wondering what it might mean \u2013 or mind-reading their own conclusions into it.\n\nNicholas Heras of the liberal think-tank CNAS suggested this might mean the US is keeping a \u201cresidual force\u201d in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, contrary to earlier reports that all forces would be withdrawn except for a small garrison at At-Tanf on the border with Jordan.\n\n\"The U.S. has secured the Oil...\" does that mean the United States is keeping a residual force in E #Syria (MERV)? \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/lTvqFYiTXZ \u2014 Nicholas A Heras (@NicholasAHeras) October 18, 2019\n\nWashington has kept a small number of special forces operators in Syria for the past several years \u2013 against international law and stretching the US legislation authorizing military action abroad \u2013 with the purpose of leading Kurdish militias against IS.\n\nGiven that I'm a retired US Intelligence officer, I'm very familiar with Middle Eastern oil fields.\n\n\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n\n\nTrump said: \"The U.S. has secured the oil.\"\n\n\n\nWhat oil fields in Syria has the US secured? Show me THAT oil, the SYRIAN oil secured by the US. Show me that. https://t.co/YfYozaj1tC \u2014 Stonekettle (@Stonekettle) October 18, 2019\n\nTerritories liberated by these \u201cSyrian Democratic Forces\u201d included much of Syria\u2019s farmland and oil fields east of the Euphrates, which the US refused to turn back over to the government in Damascus.\n\nAs Turkey invaded northern Syria last week to go after the Kurdish militias it has declared terrorists, the Kurds reportedly struck a deal with Damascus for government forces to move back in to the border. It stood to reason that this would apply to the oilfields and the rest of the territory in the interior as well, whether now or a little bit later.\n\nAlso on rt.com About 166,000 Syrians displaced over past 7 days because of hostilities \u2013 UN\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet opens up the possibility that some US troops will be staying behind to prevent this from happening, although that does not fit with the general withdrawal orders confirmed by the Pentagon earlier. Far more likely is that he was referring to oilfields previously used by IS to funds its \u201ccaliphate,\u201d that are now safely in the hands of local forces opposed to them. No one but Trump himself actually knows, however.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
