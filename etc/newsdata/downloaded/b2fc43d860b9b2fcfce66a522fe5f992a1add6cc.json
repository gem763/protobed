But it's more than just that call. Will congress see the whistleblower's complaint that triggered all of this? And tonight, word of a phone call between president trump and speaker Pelosi just today. ABC's chief white house correspondent Jonathan Karl with what he's learned tonight. Reporter: Today, president trump announced he will release the full and unredacted transcript of his phone call with the president of Ukraine, saying it will prove he did nothing wrong. When you see the call, when you see the readout of the call, which I assume you'll see at some point, you'll understand. That call was perfect. There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. Reporter: But speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi has made it clear, she wants more. She wants the president to release the full whistleblower complaint that the intelligence community's inspector general said was \"Credible\" and of \"Urgent concern.\" Pelosi revealed the president actually called her this morning. Yeah, well, he called to talk about gun violence and it segued into other things. Can you give an indication what those other things are? Not right now. Reporter: A democratic source tells ABC news the president told speaker Pelosi he had nothing to do with the decision of his own administration to block congress from seeing the whistleblower complaint. Pelosi responded, \"Then undo it.\" The president is sounding off on the Ukraine controversy with an echo of what he said over and over again about the special counsel investigation. I think it's ridiculous. It's a witch hunt. Reporter: As for the prospect of impeachment? They're going to lose the election and they figure this is a thing to do. This never happened, where we're in the election and, I mean, if she does that, they all say that's a positive for me, for the election. Jon Karl with us here in new York because the president has been at the U.N. Here in new York City, as well. We know the president promising to release that transcript tomorrow, but speaker Pelosi wants the whistleblower's complaint. In a rare move late today, senate Republicans, Jon, said they want this, too? Reporter: In fact, David, the entire senate voted 100-0 to call on the trump administration to turn that whistleblower complaint over to the intelligence committees. And in another twist today, house intelligence chairman Adam Schiff says that he has been contacted by a lawyer for the whistleblower, the whistleblower wants to appear before congress. The whistleblower now wants to come forward?\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "The president told her that he had nothing to do with the decision of his administration to block Congress from seeing the complaint, a Democratic source told ABC News.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/WNT/190924_wn_karl1_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
