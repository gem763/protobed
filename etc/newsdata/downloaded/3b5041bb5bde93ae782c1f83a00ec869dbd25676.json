They are too important to be left in the hands of bad owners who put their business interests ahead of everything else, marginalise supporters and even put the financial security of clubs at risk.\u201d\n\nCorbyn announced the plan as part of a package of proposals that he said would \u201cempower fans\u201d and improve football governance.\n\nLabour is committed to reviewing the way football is run, ensuring that the Premier League invests 5% of its income from TV rights in the grassroots game and enforcing legislation designed to stop ticket-tout websites selling tickets at inflated prices.\n\nPoll shows Conservative party 15 points ahead of Labour Read more\n\nIt also wants to ensure that the Women\u2019s World Cup is included in the list of key sporting events broadcast free-to-air, and improve access to stadiums for disabled people.\n\nCorbyn said that football clubs should be run in the interests of supporters, not their wealthy owners.\n\n\u201cSport must be run in the interests of those who participate in it, follow it and love it, not just for the privileged and wealthy few. We will ensure that supporters have a say over how their club is run and review how fans can have more of a say about how all of our sporting bodies are run,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that staff working in football clubs would benefit from Labour\u2019s plans to ban the use of zero-hour contracts and introduce a living wage worth at least \u00a310 an hour.\n\n\n\n", "description": "A Labour government would empower supporters\u2019 trusts, says party leader", "authors": ["Andrew Sparrow"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28b48a5cba8b5fa9fad626da61f75cc7055ef02f/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=85e0673ae88daa4199075f2ed8c84e62", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
