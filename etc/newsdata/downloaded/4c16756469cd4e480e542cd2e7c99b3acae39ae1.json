Other panelists included Arizona Republican Party Chairwoman Dr. Kelli Ward, Arizona Libertarian Party Chairman Howard Blitz and Arizona Green Party First Vice Chair Amee Beck.\n\n\"The inspiration of leaders who are going to put people first is so important and that's gonna make the vote,\" Rotellini said. \"The other reason why people are going to vote is because Donald Trump is manipulating the White House and has aligned himself with ISIS and Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nWard immediately interjected.\n\n\"I-I have to say that is not true,\" Ward said. \"That is not true.\"\n\nRotellini doubled down on what she said.\n\n\"The most important thing that we can do today is vote for stability [and] vote for a president who is not going to align himself with dangerous foreign nations that are the reason we are 9/11,\" Rotellini said.\n\nWhat's interesting is Rotellini made the comments at 3:45pm EST, within an hour of President Trump and his team gathering in the Situation Room to watch as the mission to kill Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was carried out.\n\nWard called on Arizona Democrats to condemn Rotellini's comments.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely disconcerting to hear the top Democrat in Arizona slander and malign an innocent person for being aligned with the world\u2019s most evil terrorists, let alone the President of the United States,\u201d Ward said. \u201cWhile fearmongering from the Left is expected up to a point, we have to draw the line somewhere if they\u2019re going to refuse to police themselves. Baseless statements like those made by the chair of the Arizona Democrat party are wildly irresponsible and not rooted in reality.\u201d\n\nArizona Democrat Party Chairman Felecia Rotellini: Trump \u201chas aligned himself with ISIS\u201d\n\n\n\nRotellini made the remarks on Saturday, approximately 1-hour before a Trump-authorized raid in northern Syria resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi pic.twitter.com/lyYraFg6Eq \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 29, 2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday confirmed the death of al-Baghdadi, saying \"he died like a dog, he died like a coward.
