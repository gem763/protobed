Lavall\u00e9e liked water, but didn't like swimming. The only option remaining, he found, was the kayak.\n\nHe stuck with it. Focusing on kayaking also helped him stay focused in school and in a way, it helped him connect with his culture.\n\n\"The one thing I was doing is what my ancestors have been doing on the same river for thousands of years,\" Lavall\u00e9e said.\n\n\"That piece really hit me later in life \u2014 that I was kind of acting out, in a way, a modern voyageur.\"\n\nHe wants to start a program that helps Indigenous kids get involved in canoeing and kayaking.\n\n\"A lot of cultural aspects and Indigenous aspects have been stripped away from the sport. I'd like to bring a lot of that back \u2014 and not necessarily have a competitive club, but to get people to start paddling again and to get people using the river in a traditional way,\" he said.\n\n\"Paddling has been such a life-changer for me with school and everything. I want to be able to remove some of those barriers for other people so everyone has access to the sport.\"\n\nTraditional medicine\n\nDr. Marlyn Cook said she was stunned when she found out she was to receive an Indspire Award for her work as a family physician on reserve lands for 30 years.\n\nCook was on the board 25 years ago for the Indspire Awards, then called the Aboriginal Achievement Awards. Now it's full circle for the physician, who practises in her home community of Misipawistik Cree Nation in Manitoba.\n\nCook's work focuses on combining Western medicine with traditional Indigenous healing practices. After finishing medical school, she took a seven-day workshop on traditional healing practices and when she went to practise in Cross Lake, she looked to traditional healers for knowledge.\n\n\"When I met the old man that I started learning from, he told me, 'We've been waiting for you,'\" she said.\n\nCook continues to use both types of healing in her practice \u2014 with the traditional side new to many of her patients who may have had culture taken away through intergenerational trauma, she said.\n\n\"They try to take the Indian out of the child, but when you go back to ceremony, you're putting the Indian back in the being,\" she said.\n\n'It's not about me'\n\nRonald Derrickson's success in the ranching business was a factor in earning him his Indspire nod, but it wasn't the only one.\n\nRonald Derrickson was also chief of the Westbank First Nation. (Indispire Awards/Supplied)\n\nHis advocacy work for Indigenous communities in legal disputes as a Grand Chief of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs was also important to both him and his community, he said.\n\n\"I was surprised, a little bit delighted and wasn't going to come to the awards until my daughter pointed out to me the importance of this award for me to inspire other Natives,\" he said.\n\nGiven the opportunity to inspire Indigenous youth across the country, he said he couldn't pass it up.\n\n\"It's not about me,\" he said. \"It's about a lot of other people.\"\n\nOther recipients of the awards this year include:\n\nAtoat Akittirq from Igloolik, Nunavut, is an Inuit elder and Gemini award winner.
