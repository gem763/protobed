It\u2019s treason pure and simple.\u201d\n\nWeld continued: \u201cThe penalty for treason under the US code is death. That\u2019s the only penalty. The penalty under the Constitution is removal from office and that might look like a pretty good alternative to the President if he could work out a plea deal.\u201d\n\nFmr. Gov. of Massachusetts Bill Weld: \"Talk about pressuring a foreign country to interfere with and control a US election. It couldn't be clearer. That's not just undermining Democratic institutions. That is treason. It's treason pure and simple.\"https://t.co/PKXEfFVEBp \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) September 23, 2019\n\nLevin recalled the time he worked with Weld in the Reagan Justice Department, where he was the chief of staff to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese and Weld was the head of the Criminal Division.\n\n\"I worked with Bill Weld. Bill Weld is a conniving, unethical [person],\u201d he said.\n\nLevin told his audience how Weld, then-Deputy Attorney General Arnold Burns, and other top aides resigned -- amid what the \"Life, Liberty & Levin\" host characterized as an attempt to urge Reagan to fire Meese. \"And they failed... And he did all this to position himself to run for governor of Massachusetts. He's doing a similar thing against President Trump. The man is utterly unprincipled. And I'll prove it to you,\" he said playing a clip from Weld's appearance on MSNBC. (FoxNews.com)\n\n\"Listen to this,\" he said of the clip. \"This is how sick this man is: 'The penalty of treason under the U.S. Code is death'?\"\n\nLevin added: \"He doesn't have a chance in Hell of getting one percent of the vote... This man wants to be president of the United States. He doesn't even qualify to be a host on MSNBC or CNN.\"", "description": ".09/24/2019 9:35:05AM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/105/57350121-15bf-41c3-a679-9ce2783480b1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
