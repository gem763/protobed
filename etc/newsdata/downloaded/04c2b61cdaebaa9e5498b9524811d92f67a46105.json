Five of the group\u2019s leaders from across the country held a video conference call and criticised the Science Museum, National Portrait Gallery and British Museum due to their sponsorship deals with major fossil fuel firms.\n\nThe move comes as Extinction Rebellion prepares to begin two weeks of protests in London in an attempt to bring the capital to a standstill as part of a global environmental campaign.", "description": "Young climate change activists are planning to target the Science Museum in an attempt to force it to sever its ties with major oil companies which sponsor some of its most high profile exhibitions.", "authors": ["Steve Bird", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/09/15/TELEMMGLPICT000209446450-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqv3hxuICTza90rxjOncu1SL3vPOKTusd3feQ9v2tucJ0.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
