On Saturday morning I got a call to say my daughter had gone into labour. Her mother-in-law had been driving her to the hospital in Brits but on the way there\u2019d been an accident and the car rolled.\n\n\u201cMy daughter had been lying on the back seat. Bystanders broke open the sunroof to get her out. She was unconscious. She woke up in hospital and gave birth to a beautiful, normal, healthy baby boy.\n\n\u201cApart from a few bruises and some glass shards in her back, arm and leg, she has no serious injuries. Mom-in-law\u2019s arm and collarbone is broken but otherwise she\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nThe pictures Tina posted of the car wreck show how badly things could\u2019ve ended.\n\nTina and her 24-year-old daughter hadn\u2019t wanted to say any more about the accident. The daughter told YOU the only thing that matters is that she can hold her baby in her arms. His safety is her first priority.\n\nShe can\u2019t remember anything about the accident. Her husband had been at work when she went into labour at home and her mother-in-law had to take her to the Brits hospital.\n\nApparently, the mom-in-law had been avoiding another accident when their car rolled. Captain Elsab\u00e9 Augoustides, local police spokesperson, confirmed to YOU that the accident took place on Friday evening 27 September at around 9pm before the Buffelspoort off-ramp on the N4 highway.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019d been a pile-up following two trucks colliding. The Mercedes-Benz [in which the pregnant woman was travelling] was then involved in the accident. ER24 took the woman to the local state hospital in Brits when they realised she was having contractions.\u201d\n\nAugoustides confirmed the baby is unharmed and was born in hospital and that the mom-in-law, who also survived the accident, was taken to a different, private hospital.\n\n\u201cThey were very lucky,\u201d Augoustides added.", "description": "A mother from Rustenburg in North West is grateful that her daughter and son-in-law\u2019s mom are alive after surviving a car crash on their way to hospital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9448/69d5dc3354184433b6558ae23ec04b9d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
