ENAP has denied any connection between the delivery of the Iranian crude and the toxic fallout.\n\nActivists have ramped up pressure on the government to find the culprit and resolve issues at Quintero and at other so-called \"sacrifice zones\" ahead of the COP25 United Nations climate change summit in December, when tens of thousands of environmentalists are expected to visit the Andean nation.\n\nENAP is the main oil refiner in Chile, which imports nearly all the fuel it consumes.
