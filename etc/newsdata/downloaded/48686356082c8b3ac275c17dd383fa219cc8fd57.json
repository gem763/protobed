It was widely reported as him telling Jeremy Corbyn an election was \"an elephant trap\" that would deliver \"a comfortable Tory majority\".\n\nHe also said that \"Boris Johnson knows that if no-deal Brexit stands on its own as a proposition, it might well fail. But if he mixes up the Brexit question with the Corbyn question in a general election, he could succeed\".\n\nThe Tories are ready for a No Surrender election; Labour is under pressure to pick a date as soon as possible after an extension; the Lib Dems are champing at the bit and the SNP would quite like a vote before next year, when their former leader Alex Salmond is due in court to answer charges of multiple sexual assault and rape.\n\nBut here's the thing. Despite defections, splits and ad hoc alliances, Johnson could succeed in ripping us out of the EU without any anaesthetic with the backing of just 24% of votes cast.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nIt breaks down like this.\n\n33.5million people voted in the 2016 Brexit referendum. They broke 52-48 in favour of Leaving the EU.\n\nPolls have found, with the deaths of older voters and addition of younger ones to the electoral roll, and a sizeable amount of buyers' remorse among Leavers, a re-run of that vote today would break 53-47 in favour of Remaining.\n\nEven if no-one who voted last time changed their minds, YouGov calculates that Remain is gaining about 235,000 voters a year while Leave loses about 260,000. The annual swing of around 500,000 is enough, three years on, to put Remain ahead. There is every reason to expect a high turnout among Remainers, students and young people who have never voted before, and a lower showing among Leavers who are disenchanted with the way their vote went last time.\n\nNo Brexit zealot wants a second referendum. And the Prime Minister knows it would be the end for him.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nBut a general election can be won with smaller numbers. Especially if Johnson campaigns for No Deal.\n\nThree quarters of Leave voters back leaving without a deal, or aren't bothered about it. The same proportion of Remain voters are agin it. There are a number of floating Labour Leavers who could be mopped up in the north and coastal constituencies, and surveys show that overall about 38% of voters support No Deal.\n\nIn 2005, Blair won 355 seats with 35.2% of the vote. Just 9.5m votes got him a Parliamentary majority of 66.\n\nIf Johnson campaigned for No Deal, he'd lose a dozen of his own MPs but aim to replace them with more Brexity seats. The small numbers he could command would never be enough to win a binary referendum, but could deliver him a Parliamentary mandate.\n\n(Image: Handout)\n\nThe only people whose interests are served by such a Tory election are Johnson, his bunkered, bonkers 'strategist' Dominic Cummings, and the currency speculators who will pocket a profit from a plummeting pound. They will cash out, while Johnson prepares for 5 years of doing whatever the hell he wants.\n\nLeavers will lose. They will lose the narrow mandate they had in 2016; they will lose the moral high ground; they will lose the argument that this was all going to be easy. But the damage that was done to democracy by giving them a vote for an idea no-one was able to deliver will never be reversed. They will stilll be angry and defensive.\n\nRemainers will lose. They will lose their best hope of reversing, slowing or sanitising Brexit. They too will lose hope in the democracy they put their faith in. The calm, middle-class marches, the Proms flag protests, will be replaced by a fresh generation of voters who decide the system is broken.\n\nWe all lose. However you vote, whatever party you back, wherever you are on Brexit, you'll despair. A country that has been divided will not, and cannot, be united by a general election about Brexit.\n\n(Image: Darren Staples)\n\nThe problem is partly maths - 38% wins no arguments, but it can mint a government.\n\nBut it's mainly that in a referendum you have two opposing choices, and in a general election each voter has half a dozen.\n\nWhoever you choose, they have to also be chosen by 51% of 65,000 of your neighbours, and those choices also need to be in a party which wins the argument in 319 other constituencies, to contribute to forming a government with a simple majority.\n\nIf you plan to vote Lib Dem because of their pledge to revoke Article 50, you'll need around 10m people to not only agree with you but to be geographically in the right places to have an impact. If you plan to vote for a Labour Brexit renegotiation, you face the same maths.\n\nBut if you want to vote Tory for a no deal, you merely need 7m or so votes. It destroys the Brexit Party and slays the zombie Nigel Farage. The other voters split between Labour, Lib Dems, and the 34% of people who could vote but never do. With those abstentions, he needs just a quarter of votes cast.\n\nA reminder: getting about 7-10m votes for a thing that previously won 17.4m is not a win. But yet, it is enough to win the keys to Number 10.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIf a third of people don't vote, a third of people want to revoke, and a third want no deal, that leaves just 1% of people to make a decision on behalf of all of us.\n\nA decision about a government whose members complained about \u00a39m spent on a Brexit leaflet they derided as Project Fear and are now spending \u00a3100m in loose change on telling us that Project Fear is about to become reality.\n\nA decision about a Prime Minister who led a team boasting of \"sunlit uplands\", the \"easiest trade deal in history\", and who said we didn't need \"to plan for no deal, because we're going to get a great deal\". A promised bonfire of regulations has turned into a spaghetti of extra red tape, taking back control of our borders has morphed into promising never to control the one border we have, and business has been so thoroughly f***ed by 3 years of chicanery that the economy is heading into recession.\n\nWhatever you think about Brexit, it is the most important constitutional and economic change of our lifetimes. The one we are faced with is not the one we were sold. Boris Johnson's only way out of it is a general election in which losing the argument, and 10m votes, doesn't actually matter.\n\nIt should matter. It MUST matter.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nBlair is derided by many as heartless. With massive majorities, he became a Parliamentary tyrant. When even someone like HIM points out a dystopian future he doesn't want to live in, it's time to take evasive action.\n\nWhat will Johnson do, with unfettered power? What will become of us, when the voices of two thirds are ignored? What becomes of our democracy, our Parliament, our sanity, when a binary vote on an impossible promise is replaced with a six-way bitchfight over different types of despicable?\n\nAnd what happens to Mark Francois when he is fully satisfied? It doesn't bear thinking about.\n\nDo the maths, because they have. And demand a People's Vote.", "description": "You need to do the maths, because they have", "authors": ["Fleet Street Fox", "Image", "Peter Summers", "Getty", "Handout", "Darren Staples", "Pa", "Facundo Arrizabalaga Epa-Efe Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559690.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_FSF-Numbrs2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
