Argentina need France to slip up twice to have any chance of going through. Saturday\u2019s defeat was their 10th in a row against England and they have lost 29 of their last 34 games \u2013 a shocking decline for a team who were semifinalists in two of the previous three tournaments.\n\nThey looked sharp enough early on at a rocking Tokyo Stadium having promised to play with fire, and England needed try-saving tackles by Daly and Anthony Watson to keep Matias Moroni and Santiago Carreras out and were fortunate to concede only an early penalty scored by Benjamin Urdapilleta.\n\nEngland regrouped and got on the scoreboard in the ninth minute after an impressive rolling maul took them into the danger zone and May sprinted over.\n\nArgentina\u2019s hopes were dealt a fatal blow after 17 minutes when Lavanini became the latest player to fall foul of the game\u2019s new high tackle directive when he was sent off for smashing his shoulder into the jaw of Farrell. The incident was missed by referee Nigel Owens but he had no real option once he entered into discussion with the TMO.\n\nThe Pumas might have then felt a little hard done by when Manu Tuilagi was lucky not to be yellow-carded for tackling Emiliano Boffelli in the air.\n\nThey stayed in touch on the scoreboard but were having to work desperately hard to keep England at bay.\n\nThe pressure eventually paid off after 36 minutes when England\u2019s forwards were camped on the line for numerous phases before Ford spun the ball wide left for Daly to catch, juggle, then scuttle over.\n\nThe forwards repeated the trick after the first-half gong had sounded, creating space for Youngs to dart through.\n\nFarrell hooked all three conversions and a penalty wide, meaning England reached the break 15-3 up but very much in control.\n\nThey secured a bonus point five minutes into the second half when powerful charges by Sam Underhill, Tuilagi and Lewis Ludlam made space for Ford to dart over.\n\nThat seemed to mark the end of the game as a contest as England rolled through the changes, giving welcome game time to Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell, with the only real worry being an ankle injury suffered by key number eight Billy Vunipola.\n\nMoroni scored under the posts after a rare Argentina break but it merely poked the beast as Nowell - in his first appearance since suffering a terrible ankle injury in May, bounced off three defenders to score the fifth try and Cowan-Dickie got the sixth after another unstoppable maul.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "England secured their place in the World Cup quarterfinals with a crushing 39-10 victory over Argentina on Saturday as the Pumas were forced to play for 63 minutes with 14 men after lock Tomas Lavanini was sent off for smashing his shoulder into Owen Farrell's head.
