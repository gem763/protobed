It\u2019s possible that the existing summit could take place or a summit at a later date\" he said.\n\nWhy the meeting was cancelled\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo told a Senate hearing Thursday that Pyongyang had not responded to queries by the US regarding the event's logistics.\n\n\"We've not been able to conduct the preparations between our two teams that would be necessary to have a successful summit,\" Pompeo said.\n\nHe nonetheless praised Kim for demonstrating \"enormous capacity to lead his country and his team.\"\n\nThe announcement came just hours after Choe Son Hui, a vice-minister in the North Korean Foreign Ministry, lashed out at US Vice President Mike Pence over comments he made on Fox News.\n\nPence had been commenting on remarks made by US National Security Adviser John Bolton, who said that when dealing with North korea, the U.S. should push for a deal similar to the one struck with Libya.\n\n\"Whether the US will meet us at a meeting room or encounter us at nuclear-to-nuclear showdown is entirely dependent upon the decision and behavior of the United States,\" Choe warned on the state-run KCNA network.\n\nPyongyang has made several diplomatic overtures in recent weeks such as releasing three American prisoners. Kim also met with South Korea President Moon Jae-in for a historic summit held at the Demilitarised Zone between the two countries.\n\nIn response to the cancellation, Moon called in an emergency meeting with his top aides on Thursday.", "description": "President Donald Trump has cancelled a June 12 summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to a letter released on Thursday by the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/16/23/70/1000x563_cmsv2_9d70d32f-11f2-5c6a-94dc-fa9281d2dd6a-3162370.jpg", "published_at": "2018-05-24"}
