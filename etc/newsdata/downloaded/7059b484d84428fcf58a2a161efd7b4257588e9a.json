He hadn\u2019t gone this deep in an outing since July 6. But none of the details were sharp. The offense couldn\u2019t turn base runners into rallies, the Cardinals\u2019 bullpen shut it down in the late innings, and Dexter Fowler robbed Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera of a three-run homer in the eighth. The Nationals stranded nine runners and managed just an unearned run. They soon left St. Louis with a series defeat and the pressure building.\n\nAs the Nationals\u2019 fill-in manager, Chip Hale brings loads of energy and a dose of humility\n\nThe loss brought the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers within a game of Washington in the National League wild-card standings. Both teams played Wednesday evening \u2014 the Cubs against the lowly Cincinnati Reds, the Brewers against the lowlier San Diego Padres \u2014 and each could pull a half-game closer with a win.\n\n\u201cFrustrating,\u201d Chip Hale, again filling in for Manager Dave Martinez, said of losing when Scherzer pitches well. \u201cWe know where we are. We know we\u2019re in the fight.\u201d\n\nBaseball teams spend months stressing over even the smallest decisions. There\u2019s a strategy of when, and why, to put players on the injured list. There\u2019s a science to travel and choice of road hotels. Then there are the choices made throughout each game \u2014 all magnified in a September pennant race. Washington illustrated that by rolling out Tuesday\u2019s lineup again Wednesday despite a quick night-to-afternoon turnaround. That meant pushing Howie Kendrick, 36 and on a strict load management this season, when the Nationals normally wouldn\u2019t. It meant Yan Gomes catching for the fourth straight day. It meant, more than anything, that this could be the approach moving forward.\n\nThe Nationals also shuffled their rotation to make sure both Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg, now bumped up from Sunday to Saturday this coming weekend, could be available for a potential wild-card game Oct. 1. But first, before any of that unfolds, the Nationals gathered behind Scherzer in St. Louis. This was the ace\u2019s sixth start since coming off the injured list late last month. He had been carefully building his workload, one outing at a time, but wasn\u2019t on any sort of limit Wednesday.\n\nThen Scherzer carved through the Cardinals\u2019 order, mixing five pitches, leaning on his fastball and slider before throwing more change-ups late. He retired 12 of the first 13 batters he faced. But that lone base runner, Edman, proved consequential in the third. Edman golfed a 1-2 cutter into the Cardinals\u2019 bullpen beyond the right field wall. Scherzer settled down after, and went back to dominating for a couple innings, before giving up a manufactured run in the fifth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m accountable for the pitches I throw,\u201d Scherzer said when asked if the score didn\u2019t reflect how sharp he was. \u201cToday, they put some good at-bats against me.\u201d\n\nAnalysis: How the NL Central race could benefit the Nationals\u2019 postseason push\n\nThe Nationals wasted a significant scoring opportunity against starter Adam Wainwright in the second when Scherzer ripped a single to shallow right with runners on first and second and two out. Edman charged at full speed, and third base coach Bobby Henley waved Victor Robles around third. Edman, usually a third baseman, was playing shallow with Scherzer at the plate. Henley\u2019s aggression, a hallmark of his strategy coaching third, was miscalculated, and Robles was thrown out at home.\n\nThe Nationals taxed Wainwright in the seventh once Trea Turner drove in Gomes with a two-out double. But the 38-year-old righty then got Adam Eaton to fly out to deep right. He was helped through the inning because Hale let Scherzer hit for himself with one out and a runner on second. Hale said he would have considered lifting Scherzer if two runners were on. But he still felt that, with a climbing pitch count, Scherzer was Washington\u2019s best option for the seventh.\n\nScherzer lasted just two more outs, and three more Cardinals runs, once the inning was extended and he walked off the field for good.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you play playoff-quality teams. It comes down to the little stuff,\u201d Scherzer said, pointing the finger at himself before Soto or anyone else. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how good the big stuff is. Everyone can execute the big stuff at this point. It comes down to the fine details. That\u2019s what kind of did me in today.\u201d\n\nThe crushing rally never happens if Soto hadn\u2019t lost track of the ball, if it had been hit a foot or two in any direction, if the sun hadn\u2019t been resting in that exact spot in that exact moment to cause exactly what the Nationals couldn\u2019t afford. But the box score will reflect only the damage done.\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nHow the NL Central race could benefit the Nationals\u2019 postseason push\n\nAn MLB player suffered facial fractures after being hit.
