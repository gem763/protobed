Instead, the Patriots traded the receiver to the New York Jets before the season even started.\n\nThomas could have signed with any other team when the Patriots cut him in late August, but he chose to stick around and re-signed two days later. The Antonio Brown signing precipitated Thomas' trade to New York, and although Brown was released 10 days later amid sexual assault allegations, Thomas had already been dealt to the division rival for a sixth-round draft pick.\n\n\u201cIt was insulting, for sure,\u201d Thomas told the New York Daily News on Wednesday. \u201cOnce I got cut, I could have just come here (to the Jets) and not stayed there and re-sign. When they re-signed me, I was thinking that I was good. Two weeks later, I was gone. So, it\u2019s like, \u2018Why did I waste my time?\u2019 Because at the end of the day, it was kind of a waste of time for me.\u201d\n\nAsked Thursday about Thomas' mark, Belichick maintained the franchise had been forthcoming.\n\n\u201cDemaryius is a great kid, I have ton of respect for him ... our circumstances changed,\u201d Belichick said in a news conference.\n\nThomas said he appreciated the Patriots taking a chance on him while dealing with a torn Achilles suffered in December while with the Houston Texans. He was reunited with Josh McDaniels, the New England offensive coordinator who drafted Thomas in the first round in 2010, when McDaniels was the head coach of the Denver Broncos.\n\nNFL TRADE DEADLINE:19 names to keep an eye on as 2019 cutoff for deals nears\n\nWEEK 7 NFL PICKS:Do Cowboys or Eagles claim first place in NFC East?\n\nThomas is currently back with former Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase, who is the Jets' first-year head coach. That still doesn't mitigate the sting of being blindsided by Belichick's maneuver.\n\n\"I felt like I was cool,\" he told the Daily News. \"But even having conversations with (McDaniels) and couple other people, it was like, \u2018You\u2019re going to be okay.\u2019 Two weeks later, AB gets cut ... and then they kicked me (to the curb) and shipped me out like I\u2019m just a rookie.\n\n\"It was disrespectful to me. Like, you know, you could trust me and I could trust you. You told me when you cut me at the (final) cut, sit around you\u2019ll bring me back. And I stayed. I could have easily become a Jet once I got cut. ... I could have been here the next day after I got released. But I chose to stay.\"\n\nThomas spent the first 8.5 seasons of his career in Denver and made five Pro Bowls. In 2019, he played the final seven games for the Texans following a mid-season trade.", "description": "New York Jets wideout Demaryius Thomas is content, but he felt disrespected when the New England Patriots traded him, saying the move was \"insulting.\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/17/USAT/0002043a-4d75-4b7d-8b58-3b0e596b5687-Demaryius_Thomas.JPG?crop=1295,728,x542,y45&width=1092&height=728&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
