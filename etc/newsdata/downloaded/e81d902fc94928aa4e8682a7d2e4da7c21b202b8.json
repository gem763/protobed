His left arm was also broken above the wrist.\n\nParker said he dragged himself along the creek to a more commonly used walking track, taking two days to cover a distance that he had walked in 40 minutes on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI was getting very emotional thinking this is not a nice way to die, just lying here,\u201d he said.\n\nA search was launched on Monday after he failed to turn up for work and his boss rang his ex-wife, who raised the alarm. Parker\u2019s former spouse discovered he had told friends he was considering a walk to the waterfall.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A hiker on Wednesday said he crawled for two days through rugged Australian woodland with a broken leg and arm after falling six meters (20 feet) down a waterfall and then dropping his cellphone in a creek.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
