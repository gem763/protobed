Often, the address will only differ by one or two characters,\" Potgieter said.\n\n\n\nSabric urged companies to never list main email address publicly online and to use a separate email address for the internet from their personal or business email account.\n\n\n\nAhead of Friday's strike, through which banking union Sasbo protesting retrenchments and job instability in the sector, FNB advised clients to access the bank's services through the FNB app, ATMs, automated deposit terminals, online and cellphone banking.", "description": "Criminals impersonate senior managers and send email requests to junior staff in the accounting or finance function requesting that an urgent payment be made to a specific beneficiary.", "authors": ["Compiled Khulekani Magubane"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7923/ad02da5488c245c9bc762a236981eb88.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
