But this is an over-simplified explanation, and there\u2019s a lot more to consider when it comes to obesity.\n\nObesity is influenced by a lot of things, including your overall lifestyle habits, your diet, how you eat in your culture (social norms), how stressed out you are (impacts your food decisions) and many other factors. It can also be influenced by certain medication and medical conditions.\n\nYour genes play a significant role in obesity too \u2013 you can have a genetic predisposition to being overweight/obese. While this not always the primary cause for weight gain, it\u2019s still an important consideration.\n\nIf you have a family history of obesity and fear that your fate may be tied in to theirs \u2013 a new study is here to bring you some good news.\n\nREAD MORE: \u201cI Lost 38 Kilos When I Discovered My Passion For Running\u201d\n\nNew research involving over 18 000 participants published in the PLOS Cognitive Neuroscience Channel: Genetics journal looked at which exercises are the best for weight loss, particularly for people who are genetically predisposed to obesity.\n\nHow the study was done\n\n\u201cWith a sample of 18 424 unrelated Han Chinese adults, we comprehensively investigated gene-exercise interactions on five obesity measures: BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio,\u201d the study says. They also took age, gender, lifestyle habits (like drinking and smoking) into consideration.\n\nThe researchers then analysed 18 different kinds of exercise to see which one had the best results for weight loss. And they concluded that running \u2013 yes, running \u2013 was the best form of exercise for someone that is genetically predisposed to obesity.\n\nThe results\u2026\n\n\u201cAmong these exercises, regular jogging consistently presented the strongest evidence to mitigate the genetic effects on all five obesity measures (BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio).\u201d\n\nThe study went on to say that other forms of exercise that also reduced the genetic effects on BMI included: mountain climbing, walking, international standard dancing and longer yoga sessions.\n\nInterestingly, the study found that while cycling, swimming and stretching were quite popular, they didn\u2019t produce the same results.\n\nREAD MORE: Thinking of Running For Weight Loss? What You Really Need To Know, According To Experts\n\n\u201cExercises such as cycling, stretching and swimming were more popular, or as popular, as yoga \u2013 but their evidence of interacting with genetic risk scores was relatively weak,\u201d the study says.\n\n\u201cFew studies have investigated the interplay between particular kinds of exercise and genetic risk of obesity measures. Therefore we can hardly compare our results with previous findings.\u201d\n\nThey give two main reasons as to why they think these types of exercise didn\u2019t have a great impact:\n\n\u201cCycling and stretching require less energy expenditure than many of the other forms of exercise.\u201d\n\n\u201cExercise done in cold water such as swimming can especially stimulate appetite and food intake.\u201d\n\nOutside of the study, running has life-changing benefits that we should all be familiar with.
