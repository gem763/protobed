REUTERS/Jok Solomun/File Photo\n\nThe council, a transitional government, has made peace-making with rebels fighting Khartoum one of its main priorities.\n\nBeing designated a state sponsor of terrorism cuts Sudan off from desperately needed debt relief and financing from lenders such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Removal from the list potentially opens the door for foreign investment.\n\nArriving in Juba on Monday, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, a member of the sovereign council and head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, expressed optimism.\n\n\u201cWe shall start negotiations with open hearts and we are serious about bringing peace to Sudan,\u201d Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, said.\n\nThe council took over the government in August when military and civilian parties and protest groups signed a three-year power-sharing deal after months of strife following the removal of authoritarian president Omar al-Bashir in April.\n\nSouth Sudan brought together members of the council and rebel leaders from several areas for the latest talks.\n\nThousands of people have been killed in Sudan\u2019s civil wars, including the conflict in the western Darfur region, where rebels have been fighting the government since 2003.\n\nIn August, Sudanese officials and rebels set a two-month period for talks starting on Oct. 14.\n\n\u201cThis should be the last round of talks that should address the root causes of war and marginalisation,\u201d said Yasir Arman, deputy chairman of the rebel Sudan People\u2019s Liberation Army-North (SPLM-North).\n\n\u201cWe are determined that 2020 should be the year of peace in Sudan.\u201d\n\nThe talks will potentially deal with issues of how any cessation of hostilities will be monitored, and set out ways of providing humanitarian access to all parts of Darfur and the Blue Nile region.\n\nDarfur\u2019s war pits local rebel groups drawn largely from African farming tribes complaining about neglect against government forces in a conflict that has displaced about 2.5 million people. Fighting has subsided over the past four years but skirmishes persist.", "description": "Sudan's ruling council and rebel leaders started peace talks on Monday to end the country's multiple conflicts, a key condition for the country's removal from the United States' sponsors of terrorism list.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440738438&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D15S-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
