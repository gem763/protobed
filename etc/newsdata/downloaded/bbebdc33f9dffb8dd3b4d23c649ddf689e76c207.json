Deadline reported that showrunner Jane Goldman \"has been emailing the cast and crew of the project to tell them that the pilot is dead.\"\n\nHBO has not confirmed or denied the story.\n\nWHAT 'GAME OF THRONES' FINALE MEANS FOR HBO'S FUTURE\n\nThe pilot was actually shot over the summer and HBO programming chief Casey Bloys told The Hollywood Reporter \"This is a pilot, so we're doing it the old-fashioned way, which is shooting a pilot. My expectation is it will be great and we'll move forward and it'll move along on a regular TV timetable.\"\n\nBut apparently the pilot \u2014 allegedly about the first time the White Walkers and humans crossed swords \u2014 was not so \"great.\"\n\nThis development comes on the heels of the original \"Game of Thrones\" creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss announcing yesterday that the would not be creating the new \"Star Wars\" movie despite a big announcement from Lucasfilms in February of 2018 that the duo would oversee the next trilogy.\n\n\u201cWe love 'Star Wars,'\u201d Benioff and Weiss said in a statement to Deadline, \u201cWhen George Lucas built it, he built us too. Getting to talk about 'Star Wars' with him and the current 'Star Wars' team was the thrill of a lifetime, and we will always be indebted to the saga that changed everything.\u201d\n\nThe two have no involvement in the proposed \"Game of Thrones\" spinoffs and left HBO in favor of a $250 million deal with Netflix in August.\n\n'GAME OF THRONES' CAST NET WORTHS\n\nBenioff and Weiss might be able to relate to the struggles that the team behind the Watts pilot is going through. The original \"Game of Thrones\" pilot was never aired by HBO. Of the original pilot, Benioff told the Scirptnotes podcast that it \"was one of the most painful experiences of my life.\u201d\n\nThe pilot eventually recast several roles.\n\n\"We ended up reshooting the pilot, 90 percent of the pilot was reshot,\" Benioff said. \"I mean, it was like 92 percent, I mean, literally, so much of it was reshot that a different director got credit.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "\u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 prequel pilot dropped at HBO", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/05/0/0/AP19126687408824.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
