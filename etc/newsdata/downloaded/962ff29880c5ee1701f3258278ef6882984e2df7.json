It had real repercussions for them.\u201d\n\nThe source also claimed that British families of those murdered by \u201cthe Beatles\u201d were misled by UK government officials. \u201cThey were told that \u2018if these men are not sent to the US, we won\u2019t be able to prosecute them\u2019. They actually said this to victims in the case, which is really shocking.\u201d\n\nDespite prosecutors concluding they had a realistic prospect of convicting Kotey, then security minister Ben Wallace told parliament in July 2018 that the UK did not have evidence to try him in the UK, and a US trial was the only option.\n\nIn the same month, a leaked letter from former home secretary Sajid Javid to Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, revealed that the UK was sending Kotey to the US and had not demanded \u201cassurances\u201d that he would be spared the death penalty.Justifying the decision, Javid said that a \u201csuccessful federal prosecution in the US is more likely to be possible\u201d.\n\nTranscripts from the supreme court also reveal that UK prosecutors believe they could try another \u201cBeatles\u201d member in Britain. Londoner El Shafee Elsheikh, 30, who was also sent to Iraq last week, could be charged at least with the offence of being a member of a proscribed organisation. The \u201cDPP [the director of public prosecutions] now concedes that there may be sufficient evidence to charge and prosecute him [Elsheikh] here\u201d, states a document.\n\nMother of alleged Isis killer loses legal fight against Home Office Read more\n\nTwo years after the CPS issued arrest warrants for Kotey in 2016, the Home Office withdrew his and Elsheikh\u2019s British citizenship, leaving them stateless and at risk of \u201crendition and torture\u201d.\n\nMacdonald, a crossbench peer, said that stripping Kotey of his citizenship appeared to be an attempt by the government \u201cto duck responsibility for bringing this Briton to justice.\u201d He called for Kotey to be repatriated urgently from US custody to the UK.\n\n\u201cThe government owes it to the victims, and to their families and friends, to put political cowardice to one side, to live up to its constitutional responsibilities, and to bring this man to justice before an English jury,\u201d said Macdonald.\n\nThe details have emerged as the high court later this month considers an application for judicial review by the mother of ElSheikh to try and force the government to try him in the UK.\n\nMaha Elgizouli is taking action against the CPS after her lawyers claimed there was sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute her son in Britain, rather than allow him to be taken to the US.\n\nThe Home Office has said its aim is for Kotey and Elsheikh to \u201cface justice in the most appropriate jurisdiction, which maximises the chance of a successful prosecution\u201d and stated the UK would work \u201cextremely closely with the US government and others to achieve this aim\u201d.\n\nYesterday, a Home Office spokesperson added: \u201cOur priority is to deliver justice for the victims\u2019 families and for the individuals suspected of these sickening crimes to face prosecution as quickly as possible.\u201d", "description": "QC says a US trial makes Britain look like a \u2018banana republic lacking faith in our own institutions of justice\u2019", "authors": ["Mark Townsend"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3dd2f585d92159a710cb3f5488a339a2aaadb205/0_53_1622_973/master/1622.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=feeb5ac67242a51610c3e78bdead80a1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
