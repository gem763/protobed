The reform is set to be implemented after the next scheduled elections in 2023, though there are potentially further hurdles to clear, including a possible referendum.\n\nThe reduction was a flagship proposal of the anti-establishment 5-Stars, which in August forged an uneasy ruling coalition with the country's center-left Democrats.\n\n\"For the first time we have seen lawmakers cutting their own seats,\" said 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio.\n\nItaly's Premier Giuseppe Conte hailed the decision as \"a historic day for Italy.\"\n\nSince their birth, the 5-Stars have pledged to tackle wasteful spending and say the cut will deliver savings of around 300,000 euros ($330,000) a day.\n\nCritics say it's a tiny saving in the grand scheme of things. Italy's overall debt stands at around 130% of its annual GDP. Only Greece's debt burden is higher among the 19 European Union countries that use the euro currency.\n\nThey also warn that cutting the chambers' size could end up hindering democratic representation.\n\nThe overhaul, which was voted by both the ruling parties and most of the opposition, could still be challenged in a referendum, with opponents warning that it could favor powerful lobbies, giving them a stronger influence on a slimmer parliament.", "description": "Italian politicians have backed a radical overhaul of the country's parliament that will see around a third of them losing their job.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/83/34/1000x563_cmsv2_73baea90-794b-5bcc-bb73-a80fa03a6684-4218334.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
