Mr Onions said he was so scared he bolted into oncoming traffic after Milat pointed a gun at him and reached for some rope. Onions got away and identified Milat from photos show to him by the police in 1994. Milat was arrested on 22 May, 1994 and Onions was a key witness at his trial.\n\nThe self-confessed gun enthusiast was regarded as a conscientious employee, with one boss saying he was 'the best worker we ever had'.\n\nHis former wife Karen, who left him in 1987 after four years of marriage, described him as 'gun crazy', recalling him killing kangaroos on a visit to Belanglo State Forest.\n\n'Ivan pulled out a rifle, shot the first kangaroo, shot the second kangaroo, slit its throat and kicked it to make sure it was dead,' she said.\n\nMilat also was found guilty of kidnapping British backpacker Paul Onions who escaped his clutches in January 1990, near the turn-off to the forest.\n\nMr Onions said he was so scared he bolted into oncoming traffic after Milat pointed a gun at him and reached for some rope.\n\nThe crimes made headlines around the world, shattering Australia's standing as a safe haven for budget-conscious young travellers.\n\nOver the years, Milat has been linked to the disappearance of other young men and women in areas where he worked with a road gang.\n\nJustice Hunt had commented it was 'inevitable' Milat was not alone in committing the murders.\n\nIn 1974, he was cleared of raping one of two young hitchhikers he picked up three years earlier near the same highway where the seven murdered backpackers were picked up.\n\nMilat had denied one woman's evidence he produced two knives, threatened to kill them if they did not have sex with him, and had two lengths of pink nylon cords.\n\n'He said he made a habit of picking up hitchhikers and was always prepared with the knives,' she testified.\n\nHe told them he was going to kill them, saying: 'You won't scream when I cut your throats, will you?'\n\nMilat passed away at 4.07am on Sunday morning in the hospital section (pictured) of Sydney's Long Bay jail\n\nMilat - Australia's worst serial killer - has died aged 74 of cancer which riddled his bodies\n\nBut Milat told the jury that her 18-year-old friend agreed to have sex with him in the front seat of his car on a dirt road.\n\n'It was a friendly trek down there and afterwards when I run them back to the shops, she was real friendly, she was okay, and everything seemed to be alright.'\n\nMilat gave evidence at his 1996 trial, coming across as cool as a cucumber, as he denied the overwhelming evidence against him.\n\nHundreds of pieces of information linked him to the murders including property of the victims: a jersey worn by Ms Clarke resembled one Milat gave his girlfriend.\n\nThe prosecutor accused him of 'incredible arrogance and unbelievable self-confidence'.\n\nHe'd tuck a pistol into one of his well-polished boots when he went to the movies, kept a pistol under his car seat and a 'friendly machete' in his vehicle.\n\n'Bloody beauty': Victims' families react to news of Milat's death By Kylie Stevens Melbourne woman Deborah Everist was just 19 when she went missing with boyfriend James Gibson, 19, in late December 1989. Their parents reported the pair missing to police a week later but their bodies weren't found in Belanglo State Forest almost four years later. 'Yes!' was Deborah's brother Tim Everis's initial response on Facebook after learning of Milat's death. He told The Daily Telegraph: 'It hasn't come too soon. It's long overdue. 'For the amount of suffering he (Milat) caused to my family and to my sister, what it did to my mother, it tore her inside out and made her life a living hell.' Mr Everist also expressed his relief to Channel Nine crime reporter Simon Bouda Deborah Everist (left) and her boyfriend James Gibson (right) were among Ivan Milat's seven victims 'He just said to me 'bloody beauty'. He was very, very, happy,' Bouda told The Today Show on Sunday. 'I think what they see it as is the end of a chapter, they can now move on and continue with their lives. Ian Clarke, the father of Caroline Clarke, one of the two British backpackers killed by Milat in 1992 also welcomed the news. 'My immediate reaction is that any decent person would not wish this disease on anyone but I find it hard not to make an exception in his case after the terrifying experiences to which he subjected all those fine young people,' he said. The Welsh parents of Joanne Walters who was murdered with her friend Caroline, said they didn't wish to comment. The parents of German Gabor Neugebauer, 21, who was gagged and shot six times after he and his girlfriend Anja Habschied, 20, disappeared in January 1992 also declined to comment. 'We will not comment further these horror of our lives,' his father told The Daily Telegraph. The family of Anja Habschied could not be contacted recently while the father of German backpacker Simone Schmidl's father took his grief to the grave. Mr Gibson's family were also unable to be contacted, with his father Ray 'not to be in the best of health'.\n\nKaren Milat said her 'very fit' ex-husband made a leather holster for a revolver and 'ran around like a cowboy and called himself Tex'.\n\nHe even posed in his lounge room as an armed cowboy wearing a sheriff's badge, telling the jury 'I was trying to make up some cowboy pictures just to put in my album'.\n\nMilat watched cricket, had a cat called Gizmo, had a beloved Harley-Davidson motorcycle and used to paint model trucks and planes in camouflage colours.\n\nBehind bars, Milat remained in the headlines.\n\nA decade ago, he ended a hunger strike days after cutting off his little finger and handing it to prison officers inside an envelope padded with newspaper.\n\nHe severed the finger with a serrated plastic knife and addressed the envelope to the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia.\n\nSimone Schmidl (pictured) from Germany had last been seen leaving Sydney for Melbourne\n\nIn early 2001, Milat swallowed razor blades, paper staples and a tiny metal chain, and then later that year he swallowed part of the flushing mechanism from the toilet in his cell.\n\nShockingly, his terrible legacy continued in 2010 when his great-nephew, Matthew Milat, lured his 17-year-old friend into Belanglo and murdered him with an axe.\n\nThe next day, he boasted: 'You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I did what they do.'\n\nMilat was visited by his brother and sister-in-law in his dying weeks and said he did not need a priest as he had nothing to confess.\n\nBill and Carol Milat visited the convicted killer, who they refer to as 'Mac', in hospital on Saturday.\n\n'We asked Mac the question, ''are you guilty?'' And he categorically denied it,' Carol told the Illawarra Mercury.\n\n'I said ''look, I know you're a Christian, you have Christian faith, and so do I... did you do it or not? Because if you want to speak to a priest we can arrange it''.\n\nCarol said he then began 'rattling off' reasons why he couldn't have committed the crimes.\n\nShe said she apologised to Milat for asking but told him 'everyone wants to know' and 'we know you didn't do it'.\n\nCarol said they've been punished 'all this time' because of her surname.\n\nBill said they questioned Milat about the killings because everyone wants a 'deathbed confession'.\n\nHe added that he was with Milat during three days where crimes took place.\n\nMilat's victims were variously shot and stabbed and one of the bodies was found decapitated. Pictured: Milat in a home photo holding a large gun\n\n'Mac is upset because it has affected all of us, but like I said many times before, people still believe Lindy Chamberlain is guilty even though she was exonerated. They are never gonna change their mind no matter what the truth is,' Bill said.\n\nIan Clarke, the father of one of Milat's victims, has now been the chance for a deathbed confession.\n\nMr Clarke's daughter Caroline and her friend Joanne Walters were among the seven young backpackers Milat killed and dumped in the Belanglo State Forest.\n\n'We still think of Caroline every day but it doesn't mean to say we have to think of Milat every day,' Mr Clarke said from his home in Northumberland.\n\nOf the killer's demise, he added: 'It's a horrible way for anybody to end their life but then it was even more horrible the way our daughter and so many others lost theirs, so sympathy isn't high on the list, I'm afraid.'\n\nMilat served seven life sentences for the murders of seven backpackers, including British tourist Caroline Clarke (left) and Joanne Walters (right)\n\nMr Clarke said a final confession and admitting where any other bodies were disposed could have brought some kind of closure to other families, who he said he feels 'desperately sorry for' as they will now never receive that.\n\n'If he was to finally face up to the fact and admit to any others that he has done, if indeed he has, then I think that would be a wonderful thing for those parents, because for the short time that we didn't know, I know just how they must be feeling,' he said.\n\nln July, Milat wrote a three-page letter maintaining his innocence.\n\n'My life since arrest, and then conviction, has been devoted wholly to prove my innocence,' he wrote in a handwritten letter to the Sun-Herald.\n\nMilat complained the court and judiciary 'conspired to obscure the miscarriages of justice' in his case and accuses police of setting him up.\n\n'Framed by Small and co., a malicious court trial, the appeal judiciary protect the verdict,' the dated July 11 letter began.\n\nThis was in reference to retired NSW Police detective Clive Small, who led the backpacker murders investigation.\n\nIn his letter, he claimed NSW Supreme Court judge David Hunt was biased against him and attacked how the jury was directed.\n\n'The case against the prisoner at the conclusion of the evidence and the addresses was, in my view, an overwhelming one,' Judge Hunt said in sentencing.\n\nMilat was also questioned over the disappearance of two nurses in 1980 near where he was working on a road crew, and was named at an inquest as the man most likely to have killed a schoolgirl and her boyfriend in Sydney in 1978\n\n'Although his legal representatives displayed a tactical ability of a high order, and conducted his defence in a skilful and responsible manner, in my view the jury's verdicts were, in the end, inevitable, I agree entirely with those verdicts. Any other, in my view, would have flown in the face of reality.'\n\nMilat mounted numerous legal challenges to his conviction including an appeal in 1998 and two unsuccessful attempts to take the case to the High Court.\n\n'I strive to overcome their bastardry, I have on occasions seriously jeopardized my life to overcome their utter unreasonableness,' he wrote in the letter.\n\nHe has spent most most of the last two-and-a-half decades in Goulburn's Supermax prison, the strictest in Australia.\n\nHe was also questioned in 2004 about the disappearance of two nurses at Parramatta in 1980 when he was working at the nearby Granville depot of the then Department of Main Roads.\n\nIn 2006 Milat was named by police at an inquest as the person most likely to have killed a schoolgirl and her boyfriend who disappeared from northern Sydney in 1978.\n\nTimeline of terror: Milat's murders December 27, 1944: Ivan Robert Marko Milat is born in Sydney December 30, 1989: Melbourne couple James Gibson and Deborah Everist, both 19, last seen in inner-Sydney with plans to hitchhike to Albury on the NSW/Victoria border.
