They pool money from many investors and use complex strategies to invest, often aggressively.\n\nMost people can\u2019t invest in hedge funds\u2014only high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. So it seems like every time you read about these funds, there\u2019s some really rich guy in the story, flying around on private jets, making splashy deals. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of hedge funds, maybe on shows like Billions or in movies like The Big Short.\n\nHedge funds are a special type of investment company. They pool money from many investors and use complex strategies to invest, often aggressively.\n\nMost people can\u2019t invest in hedge funds\u2014only high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. So it seems like every time you read about these funds, there\u2019s some really rich guy in the story, flying around on private jets, making splashy deals.\n\nBut those popular images are largely myth.\n\nThe ho-hum performance of the average hedge fund simply doesn\u2019t back it up. In fact, over the last five years, you could have beaten 9 out of 10 hedge funds by just buying the S&P 500.\n\nSince 2014, the Barclay Hedge Fund Index has returned 3.4% annually, barely beating US government bonds. And it severely lagged behind the S&P 500, which has grown 10.7% annually during that period.\n\nIf you look back 10 years, it\u2019s the same story:\n\nSource: Mauldin Economics\n\nThat said, a small group of elite hedge funds absolutely crush the market, earning annual returns in the neighborhood of 15% to 20%.\n\nEven better, you can buy some of the same stocks they do (without taking on huge risks inappropriate for income investors).\n\nThe Best Funds Aren\u2019t the Ones You\u2019ve Heard Of\n\nOverall, hedge funds managed $3.2 trillion last year.\n\nSome of the best-known hedge funds, like Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater Associates, manage over a hundred billion in assets. But over the past five years, these mega-funds have underperformed both the S&P 500 and their smaller competitors.\n\nTake Crawford Lake Capital Management, for example. This small, elite fund manages $1 billion in assets. Since 2014, it\u2019s returned more than 14.1% per year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 (10.7%).\n\nTiger Global Management is another top-tier hedge fund. It manages $36 billion in assets, and it\u2019s returned 22.3% annually over the last three years.\n\nThere\u2019s also Anson Funds Management LP, which manages $548 million. The fund has returned 11.7% annually since 2007\u2014nearly double the S&P 500 over the same period.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to consistently beat the market by this much. But these guys aren\u2019t doing magic tricks. We\u2019ll take a look at what they\u2019re buying in a moment.\n\nTracking the Whales\n\nOne of the best ways to track hedge funds is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey. It includes 224 funds with over half a trillion in assets under management.\n\nHere\u2019s the most recent survey. It shows that hedge funds are buying utilities, staples, and telecom stocks right now.\n\nSource: Mauldin Economics\n\nThe Global Fund Manager Survey is a great way to see where the overall hedge fund industry is moving. But you can go a step further.\n\nRemember those three funds I mentioned earlier? They all disclose their top holdings each quarter.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Need Hedge Fund Access to Buy These Three Stocks\n\nHedge funds have to file something called Form 13F. These filings show each fund\u2019s top holdings. They even show how much the funds allocate to each stock.\n\nFor instance, Crawford Lake, one of the elite funds I mentioned earlier, has 15% of its assets in Walt Disney Company (NYSE: ).\n\nDisney is a diversified media juggernaut. It owns globally recognized brands, including Marvel, LucasFilm, and ESPN. It also owns theme parks around the world. Plus, it launched a streaming service recently called Disney+ to compete with Netflix.\n\nDisney is also a consistent dividend payer. It\u2019s raised its dividend for fourteen straight years and sports a 1.4% dividend yield.\n\nMeanwhile, Tiger Global Management has 11.1% of its assets in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: ).\n\nMicrosoft is one of the largest companies in the world and the dominant player in consumer and enterprise software. It has a wide product portfolio, including premier operating system Windows, Xbox entertainment systems, and professional network LinkedIn.\n\nMicrosoft pays a safe 1.5% dividend, and it\u2019s increased its payout for 14 years in a row.\n\nWe also talked about Anson Funds Management LP. While over half of the fund\u2019s assets are shorting the , 3.1% of its holdings are in Barrick Gold Corp. ( ).\n\nBarrick is one of the world\u2019s largest gold producers. Gold is considered a safe haven asset, and investors buy gold stocks when they think stock market volatility is rising. Barrick also pays a decent 1.0% dividend.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Robert Ross covering: XAU/USD, S&P 500, Microsoft Corporation, Walt Disney Company.
