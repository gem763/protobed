All member states, including France, are understood to be in favour of avoiding such a gathering \u2013 though if no agreement can be found then one might ultimately become necessary anyway.\n\nSpeaking after Friday's two-hour meeting of EU ambassadors, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there had been \"no decision\".\n\nOne EU diplomat said: \"EU27 Ambassadors met today for around two hours for talks on the British request for an extension.\n\n\"There is a consensus that the EU will agree on an extension. Talks on the length of the extension will continue at the beginning of next week.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the European Commission told reporters in Brussels: \"What I can tell you is that the EU27 have agreed to the principle of an extension and work will continue in the coming days. The intention is to take this decision by written procedure.\"\n\nBoris Johnson formally requested the delay after being forced to by a law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. However, Mr Johnson has also said he does not want to delay the UK's departure beyond 31 October this year for any reason, describing the situation as \"do or die\".\n\nThe main reason most countries favour a three month delay is because it is the amount specified in the so-called Benn Act that forced the prime minister to request the extension. EU member states are loathe to get involved in internal UK political debates and see such an extension as the most neutral possible.\n\nAny extension has to be agreed unanimously be the 27 remaining EU member states. Brexit has already been delayed twice from 29 March 2019 to later in the spring, and then again to the current 31 October deadline.\n\nIf the UK ratifies the withdrawal agreement during any extension it can leave early, under the terms of Article 50 \u2013 this approach is sometimes referred to as a \"flextension\". However, the passage of major international agreements through parliament typically takes months and MPs want time to scrutinise the deal and amend its implementation on the UK side.\n\nRead more\n\nWhat is the EU\u2019s position on another Brexit extension?", "description": "EU ambassadors failed to reach agreement on a further Brexit delay at a meeting in Brussels on Friday morning.Diplomats say a decision is now expected on Monday or Tuesday next week \u2013 just 48 hours before the UK is due to crash out of the bloc.", "authors": ["Jon Stone"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3G5nF7J0vK_Q7Bb3icaYIA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/a25126471965b2254a41780ce003cfa1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
