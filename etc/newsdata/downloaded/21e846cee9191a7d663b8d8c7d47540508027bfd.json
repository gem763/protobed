Nine of the 12 companies which did the probes said they have found no such cases.\n\nThe remaining three, whose names Sugawara refrained from disclosing, are still conducting investigations.\n\n\"Utility firms are receiving electricity fees from people and they are similar to a tax,\" Sugawara said, adding the Economy, Trade and Industry Ministry demanded such companies ensured compliance.\n\nAt Kansai Electric's Kyoto branch, according to the report, Yoshida Kaihatsu had directly received orders for eight projects without tendering a bid during the same period.\n\nTax authorities have found, meanwhile, that from fiscal 2013 to 2018, orders placed by Osaka-based Kansai Electric with Yoshida Kaihatsu totaled some 6.47 billion yen, and that the construction firm paid around 300 million yen in commission to Moriyama.\n\nThe utility's nuclear power division placed 22 orders directly with Yoshida Kaihatsu from September 2014 to December 2017, and provided information on about 16 of them, the report said.\n\nIn addition, Moriyama received information on 67 of the 91 projects placed with Yoshida Kaihatsu through prime contractors, it said.\n\nWhen Moriyama asked to meet officials of Kansai Electric, the company confirmed whether there was information to be provided, the report said, adding that the information given to him included the size and cost of projects.\n\nThe utility \"was not aware that Mr. Moriyama was bringing money and goods in return for information,\" the report said.\n\nFrom 2016 to 2017, Yoshida Kaihatsu gave 1 million yen in cash and 400,000 yen in gift certificates to Shigeki Otsuka, who was then a senior official of the utility's nuclear power division. Otsuka has returned the money and gift certificates, the company said.\n\nKansai Electric said Friday that Chairman Makoto Yagi and President Shigeki Iwane will resign or have resigned from the posts of outside directors at other companies such as Nippon Life Insurance Co and department store operator H2O Retailing Corp.\n\nThe two executives have said they have no plan to step down from their current posts at Kansai Electric or business lobbies.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "The Kansai Electric Power Co scandal over massive gifts from a former official of a town hosting one of its nuclear plants widened Friday as some of the recipients at the utility were found to be members involved in non-nuclear work.
