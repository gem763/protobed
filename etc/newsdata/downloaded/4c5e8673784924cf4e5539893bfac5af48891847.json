He answers by citing a handful of tenuous moral arguments and asserts that the polygamist\u2019s \u201ccase is trivially easy to distinguish from [the one underpinning] Obergefell, which was based on a very different kind of moral, social, and legal proposition.\u201d\n\nExcept it\u2019s not at all easy, much less trivially so, to distinguish between the merits of the two propositions. The majority in Obergefell did not find the fact that the West, for at least two millennia, held a stable conception of marriage \u2014 a union between one man and one woman, open to procreation and the rearing of children \u2014 compelling grounds to reject the claims of the plaintiffs. Obergefell clearly conceives of marriage as a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 civil, legal, and moral \u2014 to be extended to consenting claimants, with only passing regard for the existing strictures of the institution. Anthony Kennedy\u2019s opinion uses a nebulous, inchoate definition of marriage predicated on poetic notions of \u201cdignity\u201d and \u201clove\u201d rather than the traditional, unbroken consensus of Western civilization. Why would the Court find the traditional restriction of marriage to a union between two persons a compelling reason to withhold the right to marry from three (or more) claimants?\n\nIf \u201clove,\u201d \u201cdignity,\u201d and the pursuant tax advantages are the constitutive parts of marriage, on what grounds would Rauch or the courts withhold those \u201crights\u201d from polygamous unions?", "description": "", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "Nationalreview.Com Is-Limiting-Marriage-To-Two-People-Constitutional"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
