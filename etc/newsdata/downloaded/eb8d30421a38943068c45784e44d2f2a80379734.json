Apple has issued US$2.5 billion in green bonds over time to finance clean energy and environmental projects in its operations and throughout its supply chain.\n\nThere\u2019s also more diversity in the type of bonds being issued. While super sovereigns initially issued short-duration securities, which didn\u2019t offer much additional yield over government benchmarks, issuers more recently are offering longer-dated bonds, with the proceeds going to fund specific projects.\n\nThere\u2019s also been a spate of securities out of emerging markets, some with unusual structures. Earlier this month AES Gener, a Chilean power generation company, issued a US$450 million preferred security that matures in 60 years and can\u2019t be called back by the issuer in the first five years. The notes were priced to yield 6.40%, Liberatore says.\n\n\u201cThey did it because it allows them to count that as part of their equity capital,\u201d he says.\n\nGreen Returns\n\nNuveen is an active total return manager, so it seeks deals that are attractive from a relative value perspective. Because a bond is green, however, doesn\u2019t mean it will yield more\u2014or less\u2014than a similarly structured bond by an issuer with a similar credit rating.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing as the investor in this space is you\u2019re controlling how the proceeds are being used\u2014only for a green project or projects\u2014but the underlying credit risk is still with the issuer as a whole,\u201d Liberatore says.\n\nOne question is whether green bonds could actually outperform their plain-vanilla bond counterparts in a recession, since the sector hasn\u2019t really been through a down-cycle, Liberatore says. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that data or experience yet,\u201d he says.\n\nThe five-year return of the US$4.4 billion TIAA-CREF Social Bond fund is 3.73%, 0.37 of a percentage point, above the average return in Morningstar\u2019s Intermediate Core-Plus Bond category through Oct. 4. The TIAA-CREF Green Bond fund has been open less than a year, and has $31 million in assets.\n\nSustainable Bond Trends\n\nThe success of green bonds has led to the creation of other types of fixed-income securities to fund social and environmental projects. Among the newest are \u201csustainable transition bonds\u201d\u2014securities that fund projects that allow an issuer to facilitate the transition to a more green-oriented business.\n\nBut the direct benefit to the environment isn\u2019t always clear. Repsol, a Spanish oil-and-gas company, recently issued what was considered a sustainable transition bond to fund efforts to make their operations more efficient. While a more efficient operation would lead to fewer emissions of carbon dioxide\u2014clearly good for the environment\u2014it would still perpetuate Repsol\u2019s oil-and-gas business.\n\n\u201cWe did not participate in this particular transaction because our investors are not looking to support the elongation of the fossil fuel life cycle,\u201d Liberatore says.\n\nCurrently the European Union is working on a \u201cgreen bond standard and sustainable finance taxonomy\u201d according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which argues the standard would support the market\u2019s growth and maturation.\n\nBut Liberatore is concerned the taxonomy will be too prescriptive about what is or is not green.\n\n\u201cWe try to leave the flexibility up to the issuer,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you think you have an environmentally beneficial project, we would love for you to describe it to us and explain it, and maybe it\u2019s something that we can be supportive of, or not.\u201d\n\nFor example, the fund recently invested in the first \u201cblue bond\u201d\u2014a US$15 million security issued by The Republic of Seychelles to support sustainable marine and fisheries projects. The World Bank provided a US$5 million guarantee on the deal, which also included a US$5 million loan from the Global Environment Facility, which will be used to partially cover interest payments.\n\nLiberatore says the innovative public-private partnership structure provides a template that could make it easier for other issuers to issue bonds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that innovation within the market that I think is critical to rapid growth and diversification,\u201d Liberatore says. \u201cAnytime you try to implement very prescriptive things that may or may not capture that innovative curve, you\u2019re going to be missing out.\u201d", "description": "Nuveen\u2019s Stephen Liberatore on the growing market for fixed-income securities to finance environmental projects", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-114687/social", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
