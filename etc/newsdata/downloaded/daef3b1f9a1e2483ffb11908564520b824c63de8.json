At the same time, they are underrepresented in low-displacement occupations like educators, creatives, health professionals and legal professionals, the firm\u2019s research shows.\n\nAbout 25% of U.S. jobs have \u201chigh exposure to automation\u201d over the next few decades, according to a Brookings Institute analysis published in January, with more than 70% of their tasks \u201cat risk of substitution.\u201d Jobs in food preparation, office administration, transportation and production are at greatest risk for automation, the report said.\n\nAfrican-Americans workers also tend to be clustered in lower-paying occupations, found the McKinsey analysis, which included data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Census and Moody\u2019s Analytics. Seven of the top 10 jobs held by African Americans \u2014 cashiers, food-preparation and service workers, retail salespeople, customer-service representatives, office clerks, janitors and cleaners, and stock clerks and order fillers \u2014 also rank among the top 15 jobs at risk of automation-fueled displacement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, McKinsey found, there is a disconnect between where African Americans tend to live and the types of local economies (which the report classifies into \u201cgeographical archetypes\u201d) expected to hold the most job prospects.\n\n\u201cAfrican Americans are underrepresented in five out of the six projected fastest-growing geographical archetypes and are overrepresented in two of the six slower-growing archetypes, including the one archetype that has shown negative growth \u2014 distressed americana [struggling rural areas],\u201d the report said.\n\nBlack workers have the second-highest potential rate of automation-related job displacement by 2030 (23.1%), according to the report, behind only potential Hispanic and Latino job displacement (25.5%). That\u2019s compared to 22.4% for white workers and 21.7% for Asian workers.\n\nThrough a gender lens, the specter of job displacement appears more dire for black men than for black women \u2014 their projected job-displacement rates are 24.8% and 21.6%, respectively. African-American women tend to be overrepresented in health-care jobs like nursing assistants and home health aides, the report said, which are part of a growing sector and have lower potential for automation. Still, many of those positions aren\u2019t all that lucrative, the report noted.\n\nThe authors suggest a range of remedies to address the problem, including investing in higher education, particularly historically black colleges and universities, to help reduce educational disparities; and increasing access to \u201coccupation switching,\u201d or transitioning into growing careers that require similar skills but are better-paying and less threatened by automation.\n\n\u201cThe public and private sectors will need to implement targeted programs to increase the awareness of automation risk among African-American workers,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cAdditionally, both sectors will need to provide African Americans with opportunities for higher education and the ability to transition into higher-paying roles and occupations.\u201d", "description": "Some 132,000 African-American jobs projected to be displaced due to automation by the year 2030.", "authors": ["Meera Jagannathan"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS795_automa_ZG_20191007123746.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
