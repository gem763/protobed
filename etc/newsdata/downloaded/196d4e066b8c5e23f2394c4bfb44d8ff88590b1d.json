Eddie Jones made no attempt to diminish the magnitude of what his side will face. After naming his line-up for this quarter-final showdown with the Wallabies, he said: \u2018You know it\u2019s do-or-die time.\n\n\u2018You see those hills at the back of us? That\u2019s where all the samurais lived. Every time the samurais fought, one lived and one died. It will be the same on Saturday. Someone is going to live and someone is going to die. That\u2019s what the game is about and that\u2019s the excitement of the game. You get the best eight teams, all playing for their lives. It makes it a little bit different and gives it more meaning. It\u2019s fantastic.\u2019\n\nEddie Jones says the ferocious Owen Farrell will set the tone for England's quarter-final match\n\nFarrell has been selected ahead of George Ford at fly-half as England enter knockout mode\n\nThe primary subject of discussion when Jones\u2019s selection was revealed was the decision to overhaul the creative hub. Fly-half George Ford being dropped was a shock development that nobody had seen coming, given his sterling feats during England\u2019s three games to date in this tournament and the unconvincing nature of captain Owen Farrell\u2019s performance against Argentina.\n\nScott Wisemantel, England\u2019s attack coach, revealed that Farrell had described his own contribution against the Pumas as \u2018clunky\u2019. That is a fair assessment. He was a long way from his authoritative peak but what Jones wants on Saturday is for his players\u2019 combative streak to come out and in that regard, he expects his captain to set the tone.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a warrior,\u2019 the head coach said of Farrell. \u2018He leads from the front. He competes. He\u2019s tough. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to produce in this team. We\u2019ve got a tough team who compete hard. That\u2019s how we want to play. That\u2019s the England style of playing.\u2019\n\nThere has been a concerted attempt to instil a sense of national identity in the way England operate and Jones sees that as a demonstration of overt physicality and aggression. He wants his side to take charge of the set-piece contest and all the other collision areas. In explaining his selection decisions on Thursday, the word \u2018brutality\u2019 was mentioned once again. It is often the English mantra under their Australian head coach.\n\nAll over the field, Jones will expect his men to dominate their opponents by imposing their power game. Manu Tuilagi has switched to inside centre and will be charged with gaining the upper hand in a seismic duel with Samu Kerevi. The clash between those two could be quite spectacular.\n\nManu Tuilagi has switched to inside centre and will be in a seismic duel with Samu Kerevi\n\nUp front, Jones has promoted Mako Vunipola and Courtney Lawes to his starting pack, with a view to beefing up the ball- carrying clout and defensive ferocity.\n\nThere will be plenty of brutality at the breakdown, which is where the \u2018Kamikaze Kids\u2019 come in. England rookies Tom Curry and Sam Underhill face the ominous task of negating the threat posed by \u2018Pooper\u2019 \u2014 David Pocock and Wallabies captain Michael Hooper.\n\nThe England flankers are relishing the prospect of this masters v apprentices encounter. \u2018They are two world-class opensides,\u2019 said Underhill. \u2018They\u2019re players who Tom and I, when we were growing up and coming through, looked at and aspired to be like, so it\u2019s a bit surreal to be coming up against them now.\u2019\n\nJones described Underhill as the most \u2018combative\u2019 openside he has seen for some time and the Bath forward added: \u2018Being combative lends itself to the position. It\u2019s a physical position and not the most glamorous of work at times but sometimes it\u2019s not about linebreaks, mispasses or kicks in behind.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s pretty gritty and unglamorous work. You\u2019ve got to enjoy that and see how what you\u2019re doing contributes to the team. When the guys are scoring out wide it\u2019s usually because the forwards have done something good in the middle; something that\u2019s fairly dull to watch but that creates special moments in the game.\u2019\n\nEngland rookie Sam Underhill faces the task of negating the threat posed by David Pocock\n\nThe English challenge in a match they are clear favourites to win will be founded on such earthy qualities: hard graft, tenacity and aggressive commitment. Even those in the supposedly \u2018glamorous\u2019 roles have that mindset.\n\nHenry Slade will start at outside centre and when asked about the Exeter playmaker, defence coach John Mitchell said: \u2018He\u2019s a real quality athlete. He comes across as a pretty good-looking bloke, but he\u2019s physical as well and he\u2019s a tough bugger.\u2019\n\nSlade is best known for artistry and graceful attacking class, but he argues that defensive duties are his favourite part of the game. He said: \u2018Just because I look like I\u2019m in a boyband \u2014 which I\u2019ve heard before \u2014 I still enjoy the rough stuff.\u2019\n\nOn Saturday, like all the England players, Jones will expect Slade to be in warrior mode. The head coach promised that there would be 23 of them \u2014 his own samurais \u2014 in white. If they live up to that billing, they will kill, not be killed.", "description": "CHRIS FOY IN BEPPU: England will switch into knockout mode on Saturday and invoke the spirit of Japan's iconic warriors by embracing the ultimate high stakes - kill or be killed.", "authors": ["Chris Foy For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/00/19863314-0-image-a-20_1571355846403.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
