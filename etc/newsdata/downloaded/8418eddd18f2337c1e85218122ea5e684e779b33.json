Though it may not be a particularly sympathetic problem, coming into enormous wealth can be isolating and overwhelming, especially in early adulthood, a life stage when people forge important parts of their identity. Parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 central concern, according to the wealth managers I spoke with, is that receiving too much money will neutralize heirs\u2019 desire to work. There don\u2019t seem to be any studies that systematically examine this effect, but researchers I consulted said that in their experience, the mere presence of a large inheritance was not an automatic destroyer of motivation. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a fear for some wealthy parents and grandparents.\n\nFears of a too-big inheritance are, overall, likely quite rare, given that most inheritances in the U.S. are not extravagant. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that about 85 percent of inheritances are smaller than $250,000, and the majority of those are $50,000 or less. But a small segment of the country passes down a disproportionately large amount of money. While only about 2 percent of inheritances from 1995 to 2016 were larger than $1 million, that 2 percent accounted for roughly 40 percent of the money inherited during that period of time. Some of the wealth-management experts I spoke with said that they wouldn\u2019t expect many families with a net worth below $10 million to think like Chen-Zhang. But in the U.S., a not-insignificant number of families are above that threshold: A wealth-management consultancy called the Spectrem Group recently estimated that about 1.4 million American households have, between $5 million and $25 million to their name, and another 173,000 hold wealth in excess of $25 million.\n\nSo how much of an inheritance is too much? There aren\u2019t agreed-upon criteria for determining any particular cutoff. Experts on wealth and inheritances whom I interviewed for this article referred to a quote often attributed to Warren Buffett: \u201cA very rich person should leave his kids enough to do anything but not enough to do nothing.\u201d That\u2019s helpful in the abstract (and quite catchy), but doesn\u2019t provide much guidance in the way of hard numbers.\n\nScott Nash, though, has gotten down to specifics. Nash, the founder of the East Coast grocery chain Mom\u2019s Organic Market, has made more money than he\u2019d care to divvy up among his three kids. \u201cI don't let them know that anything's coming their way\u2014I think that could be dangerous to their motivation,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think that people generally ought to be in survival mode, mentally, until their mid-30s.\u201d\n\nNash figures he and his wife won\u2019t leave their kids more than $2 million or $3 million each (in today\u2019s dollars), on the assumption that when he and his wife are no longer around, their children will be in or approaching middle age and will have worked without the expectation of inheriting loads of money. At that point, he thinks an inheritance would help them \u201cavoid painful situations\u201d and cover \u201cthe basics\u201d of what he considers to be a good lifestyle. What qualifies as \u201cgood\u201d is of course subjective, but Nash would like his children to be able to \u201csend their kids to good colleges,\u201d \u201clive where they want to live,\u201d and \u201ctake some vacations.\u201d He\u2019ll leave them money, but \u201cnever so much that they don\u2019t have to work.\u201d Most of the rest of his wealth, he expects, will go to philanthropic causes.", "description": "Some wealthy parents are concerned that after a certain point, money passed down will be damaging to the next generation.", "authors": ["Joe Pinsker"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_52209515/facebook.jpg?1571953328", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
