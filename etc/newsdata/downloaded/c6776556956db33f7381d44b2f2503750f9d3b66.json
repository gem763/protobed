Her dad introduced her to country music when she was a kid.\n\n\"He was always listening to artists like Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn and Patsy Cline,\" Kozak recalled. \"Between the rhinestones and southern drawls, and me being a daddy\u2019s girl, I latched on to the music quickly. I stepped onto my first stage when I was 10 years old and sang a cover of Patsy Cline\u2019s 'Walkin\u2019 After Midnight.'\n\n\"When I felt the adrenaline rush from performing in front of a crowd, seeing people dance and sing along, I knew from that moment forward that was all I ever wanted to do,\" she recollected. \"Playing country music became a fun way for my dad and I to bond. We would learn songs and travel every weekend to play fairs, festivals and churches across Canada.\"\n\nELI YOUNG BAND ON THEIR JOURNEY TO SUCCESS AND NEARLY 20-YEAR CAREER\n\n2.
