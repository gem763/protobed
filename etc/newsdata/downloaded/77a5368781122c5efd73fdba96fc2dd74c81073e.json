Each stock pick has been updated to reflect changes in the market.]\n\nA few years ago, InvestorPlace contributor Dan Burrows highlighted the ten best-performing S&P 500 stocks of the past decade. The most important lesson one finds by studying these high-flying stocks is that patience wins out over all other attributes of a successful investor.\n\nA classic example of how true this is involves the Fidelity Magellan Fund (MUTF:FMAGX), the large mutual fund made famous by portfolio manager Peter Lynch. Lynch ran the fund for 13 years from 1977 until 1990, growing it from $20 million to $14 billion before stepping aside.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFidelity studied the returns of Fidelity Magellan unit holders over those 13 years to see how they compared to the legendary portfolio manager. While Lynch managed to achieve a 29% annual return over this period, the average investor lost money.\n\nPatience would have served those investors well, as the ups and downs of the stock market shook them out of their positions \u2014 and in doing so, deprived them of millions of dollars in profits. A $10,000 investment in 1977 held until 1990 was worth $273,947 by the end of that 13-year period.\n\nI\u2019m not Peter Lynch, but I can say with some confidence that the following names are the nine best stocks to buy for the next decade.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nNot only is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO and founder Jeff Bezos a great chief executive, but Amazon has its hands in so many pies \u2014 including a very profitable cloud business that generated $7.3 billion of operating income last year \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to fathom just how big Amazon could be a decade from now.\n\nWhile Amazon\u2019s AWS cloud business is a big deal, Amazon Prime is the service that delivers the goods when it comes to building the foundation for AMZN stock. More than 100 million people subscribe to Amazon Prime at $119 per year.\n\nIt\u2019s not the billions of dollars of annual subscription revenue that matters, but the amount each of those subscribers spends on other Amazon products. Statistics show that 76% of Amazon Prime members spend more than they did before paying the annual $119 fee.\n\nThat\u2019s what you call \u201cpulling power,\u201d and it\u2019s a big reason why AMZN stock will be a winner for the long haul and why it\u2019s a top stock to buy for the next decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nYou can say what you want about the iPhone maker\u2019s best days being behind it, but I have a feeling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will continue to create products people want to buy for years to come.\n\nWhat these products are, I couldn\u2019t tell you \u2026 What I do know is that Apple will continue to generate a huge amount of free cash flow to reward shareholders for their patience and loyalty.\n\nThat loyalty translated into AAPL stock becoming the world\u2019s first publicly traded company to hit a trillion-dollar valuation.\n\nWhile Apple is no longer reporting iPhone numbers, its Services revenue continues to look more and more promising.\n\n\n\n\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)\n\nWarren Buffett is 89 years old. Eventually, he\u2019s going to step out of the game. The argument is that his departure will create a panic that will send Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A, NYSE:BRK.B) stock spiraling downward. Personally, I don\u2019t subscribe to that theory.\n\nBusinesses \u2014 whether it be a huge holding company like Buffett\u2019s or something much less grandiose \u2014 are valued by calculating the present value of its future cash flows. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s are significant. Another way is to value a business is to look at the sum of all its parts.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns hundreds of businesses; each of these firms, if sold at auction, would be worth more than the current stock price would seem to reflect. If Buffett moved on and the company was broken up in a prudent manner over an extended period, Berkshire Hathaway investors would benefit greatly from such a process.\n\nThe best part of Berkshire Hathaway? You get a quasi-mutual fund with a diversified group of holdings and no management fees.\n\nThat\u2019s the best kind of buy-and-hold investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nUlta Beauty (ULTA)\n\nThe retail industry is in a freefall at the moment, yet Illinois-based Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is busy growing its network of stores \u2014 which currently number over 1,100 \u2014 by 100 per year. It expects to build out its brick-and-mortar footprint to 1,700 stores over the next decade.", "description": "[Editor's Note: \"The 9 Best Stocks to Buy for the Next Decade\" was originally published in April 2017.
