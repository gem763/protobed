At so many moments throughout Miller\u2019s book, we come back to the same essential message: Rape happens to individual people with full lives and loves and dreams. So often the media focuses on what a perpetrator stands to lose if convicted, and this was especially true in Miller\u2019s case, with so much media attention on her assailant\u2019s education, accomplishments and future career potential. We take the victim out of the picture because empathizing with a survivor\u2019s trauma is too painful for us. But Miller shows us her own full life: her childhood, her family, her past and present loves, her talents and dreams for her future. In doing so, she makes us understand how much the assault and the legal process cost her. \u201cKnow My Name\u201d humanizes Miller throughout an otherwise dehumanizing process of pursuing legal justice.", "description": "The book is far too nuanced to distill into an article \u2014 you\u2019ll have to read it yourself \u2014 but here are key points", "authors": ["Katie Simon", "Katie Simon Is Currently Working On A Memoir About The Year She Got The Plague."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_NdCSIhq_YyBmNT07IwQCEHVv_4=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-thelily-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZHRRVIZ7BNGCNHPYS2DWWK7Z6E.jpg"}
