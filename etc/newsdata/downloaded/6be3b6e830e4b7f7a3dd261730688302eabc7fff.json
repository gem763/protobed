But showing them how it\u2019s done is also kind of personal, and further than many are willing to go to be considered a good parent.\n\nBut one teacher came up with a brilliant way to teach what appears to be a whole class of little ones how to achieve a proper wipe \u2014 with two balloons and some TP.\n\nI will now describe for you her technique, but I insist that you also click through to Reddit to get the full visual. She ties two inflated balloons next to each other to the back of her chair (she chose red balloons, but any colour will do). She sits down, places a tissue or piece of toilet paper in her right hand and demonstrates a classic front-to-back wipe between the two inflated balloons, which look most convincingly like butt cheeks.\n\nAfter the wipe, you see her start to fold the tissue in half, so I think it\u2019s safe to assume she is showing these newbies how you can use one piece of toilet paper for multiple wipes, lessening the chance of the sort of heavy TP-overuse that leads to clogged toilets.\n\nIn the video, you should also note how these children are mesmerised by her presentation. They have their own balloons tied to their chairs for practice, so I imagine they are especially looking forward to the next part \u2014 trying it themselves.\n\nI endorse this fun (yet practical!) butt-wiping lesson.", "description": "Accurate and thorough butt-wiping is a skill every kid \u2014 who is able to \u2014 needs to master before they enter adulthood (before entering kindergarten would be even better, as I assume teachers would tell you).
