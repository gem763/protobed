The podcast made its debut on Sept. 18 and has rarely left the No. 1 spot on Apple Podcasts since.\n\nDavid Corvo, the senior executive producer of primetime news for NBC News who oversees \"Dateline\" production, attributed the podcast's immediate success to the \"Dateline\" brand, but said a good host with excellent storytelling abilities keeps listeners hooked in the long run.\n\nMorrison's hosting style is intimate, Corvo said. Instead of reporting the facts of the story to the audience after he uncovers them \u2014 as a traditional news broadcaster would \u2014 Morrison makes his listeners feel as if they're experiencing each turn of events in real time as he is.\n\n\"In a podcast, the audience is almost a sidekick, a partner, and they kind of come along for the journey,\" Corvo said.\n\nPamela Hupp's 'diabolical' behavior makes for prime audio storytelling\n\nElizabeth Cole, an executive producer of \"Dateline,\" said Pam Hupp's story alone is enough to ensure any listener stays captivated until it comes to a close.\n\nAfter Betsy Faria was murdered in 2011, her husband was convicted in 2013. But that conviction was eventually overturned, and Hupp was recently sentenced to life in prison for a murder prosecutors believe could have planned to divert attention from Faria's death, according to NBC News.\n\nShortly before Faria was stabbed to death, Hupp became the sole beneficiary of her life insurance policy and is also the last known person to have seen Faria alive, NBC News reported.\n\n\"Every step of the way, you're learning something more diabolical that she seems to have done,\" Corvo said.\n\n\"Dateline\" had covered the twist and turns of the case several times before launching the podcast, but when Hupp started posing as a producer on the show in her attempts to avoid conviction, the actual producers decided it was time to revisit the story in audio.\n\n\"It really is one of \u2014 if not the most \u2014 unusual stories we've done,\" Cole said.\n\nTrue crime podcasts are heating up, with 'The Thing About Pam' leading the pack\n\n\"Podcasts are enormously hot right now, particularly in the true crime space,\" Corvo said. \"We want to hold our place in that genre.\"\n\nFive of the top 11 podcasts in the US on Apple Podcasts fall into the true crime category, including \"The Thing About Pam\" and \"Culpable,\" a true crime podcast that aired its last regular season episode in September but continues to draw listeners as it investigates the death of Christian Andreacchio in Mississippi.\n\nREAD MORE: Spotify is tapping into the cultural zeitgeist surrounding true crime to amplify its podcast push\n\nWhile podcasts allow for the opportunity to include more personal anecdotes and in-depth reflection from reporters \u2014 like when Morrison discusses Hupp's attempts to pass herself off as a producer \u2014 there are limits to what they can achieve.\n\nListeners never get to see Hupp in action, for instance, whereas \"Dateline\" viewers get to see the woman herself in court.\n\n\"In a podcast you're asking the audio to paint the pictures that on television, you show,\" Corvo said.\n\nThe trick to creating a good true crime podcast, though, is to free yourself to tell the story in the most conversational way possible, according to Corvo. While \"The Thing About Pam\" has over 3.6 million downloads, Morrison speaks as if he's telling the story to a close friend over drinks.\n\n\"Whether you're doing a podcast or you're doing any other form, you have to think, 'How do I best execute that form?' and not worry about sticking to the rules of the old form you're used to,\" Corvo said.", "description": "Three deaths, two mediums, and a diabolical central character make for a story so compelling it's been hard to unseat from Apple Podcasts' No. 1 spot.", "authors": ["Alyssa Meyers"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cdacce8815b0401605029?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
