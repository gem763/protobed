Like, a lot. There\u2019s nary been a good episode post season 12 and hey, that\u2019s ok. But there\u2019s a particular scene from a later episode that\u2019s captured my attention and heart because two YouTubers have recreated it down to the finest detail.\n\nAs per The Advocate, Katrin von Niederh\u00e4usern and Janine Wiget spent their annual trip to New Orleans lovingly (and maybe insanely) recreating the lengthy scene from \u2018Lisa Gets The Blues\u2019 by deconstructing the whole thing, storyboarding it, mapping out each dish at each restaurant, and pulling it all together into one incredible video.\n\nThe pair have created what\u2019s possibly the greatest side-by-side video I\u2019ve ever seen, where the pair take it in turns to either be the drooling Homer, or the unimpressed Lisa, as they weat their way through over 50 locations across the Louisiana city.\n\nI never thought I would appreciate a Simpsons scene from season 39 (Christ, make it stop) but here we are.\n\nTalking with The Advocate, Katrin and Janine said that they have a tradition of recording some kind of silly video every year when they go to New Orleans, but when they both saw the Simpsons episode with the restaurant-crawl scene, they knew they had to give it a red hot go.\n\nAnd so, they went and ate just about every fucken po-boy in the city. All in the name of content.\n\nWatch the whole thing below, because God it\u2019s so impressive. Every scene recreated, right down to rolling a fried green tomato down her arm.\n\nGets the big Chef\u2019s Kiss from me, let me tell you.", "description": "Two huge Simpsons fans spent their whole week in New Orleans recreating Homer's food adventure scene by scene, and it's crazy good.", "authors": ["Courtney Fry"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/simpsons-new-orleans-site.jpg"}
