Instead, it\u2019s intended to slow decline associated with the condition among those who have early-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAducanumab, which is injected intravenously, travels through the body to brain, where it targets plaque, a contributing factor in Alzheimer's disease, explained Dr. Andrew Budson, a neurology professor at Boston University School of Medicine.\n\nBudson said patients of his who were enrolled in the initial aducanumab trial were \"very\" disappointed when the trial stopped. When the studies repeatedly failed, Budson and others were starting to wonder whether the strategy was helping patients at all.\n\n\"It was like another nail in the coffin of the hypothesis,\" he said.\n\n(MORE: Different Alzheimer's disease risks for men, women: Scientists)\n\nThe turnaround \"sends a message of hope for those in the study, as well as to the field as a whole,\" Budson added. \"When you have an incurable neurodegenerative disease that literally robs people of their thinking and memories -- their minds -- anything that can help is a wonderful thing.\"\n\nPHOTO: A sign marks a Biogen facility in Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 26, 2017.
