The Madison, Wisconsin, native was living in Paris but moved to New York to chase after a girlfriend. That didn\u2019t work out, but wandering the city streets ended up steering the direction of his career when he walked past the Odeon, the legendary Tribeca bistro whose neon sign illuminated the downtown scene in Lower Manhattan in the 1980s, drawing a cast of boldface regulars. \u201cI had read Bright Lights, Big City when I was Paris,\u201d says Cecchini, of Jay McInerney\u2019s breakout 1984 debut novel that featured an illustration of the Odeon on the cover, \u201cand was walking around New York kind of destitute when I looked up and there was the neon Odeon sign. I said to myself, Hey, that\u2019s the cover of that book. And I literally walked in and was greeted with, \u2018Yes, can I help you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yes, I would like a job I think.\u2019\u201d Cecchini\u2019s legacy lives on at the Odeon due to creating a certain pink-hued cocktail that became a pop-culture phenomenon.\n\nLiving in Brooklyn, Cecchini was one of the many people to walk past the long-shuttered Long Island Restaurant on the corner of Atlantic and Henry in Cobble Hill and shake his head in disbelief at the potential of the historic space and its art deco bar and glorious but long-dark neon sign. \u201cThe story went that three Spanish women owned it and they wouldn\u2019t talk to anybody. Every restaurateur in the city was trying to get in there.\u201d Cecchini eventually managed to arrange a walk-through of the space with Emma Sullivan, who had run the bar with her husband, Buddy, and her two cousins, Pepita and Maruja. Alperin. The bar seemed frozen in time, as if they had shut down and locked the doors after a long-ago last call. Sullivan sized up Cecchini and didn\u2019t believe he was a bartender\u2014he was too professional-looking\u2014until Cecchini showed her his calloused, banged-up hands, still rough from years behind the bar. Once he established his bona fides as a bartender, there was a spirited conversation and the impromptu interview turned into a handshake deal. Soon he and his business partner took over the lease and the neon sign was back on in 2013. \u201cMy basic philosophy is that we have this amazing space,\u201d says Cecchini. \u201cI want a really easygoing place where you walk in and think the food and drink are unnecessarily good. People are working super hard behind the scenes to make a very casual-looking place elevated.\u201d\n\nWhat is the last thing you\u2019d want to drink before you die?\n\nIt\u2019s not the Cosmopolitan. Once this woman came in and said, \u201cI want something with whiskey and bitters.\u201d Oh, that\u2019s easy enough. \u201cNot just bitters, but amaro. Do you know what amaro is?\u201d Yes, I think I\u2019m familiar with the concept, thank you. The particular thing I was messing around with at the time was the China-China from Bigallet, which I knew and loved. I had been playing with Suze on some things. Other than that, you\u2019ve got sweet vermouth and whiskey, and that\u2019s a no-brainer. And then swapping in the China-China. That\u2019s just a take on the Manhattan. But put an equal part of Suze in there, and you\u2019ve got something vinous. Something sweet. Something bitter. This woman loved it and said, \u201cOh my god, what do you call this?\u201d I said, \u201cUp to you.\u201d She said, \u201cI call it The Erin.\u201d I thought, Oh no, don\u2019t tell me your name\u2019s Erin? That\u2019s the worst. I hate that. I\u2019ll come up with something else later. But of course I never did.\n\nLook, if you\u2019re about to kick and you\u2019re looking back on your life, you want something to bring you back in\u2014something that\u2019s going to take in all the facets. The Erin is a big drink that\u2019s just swirling with complexity, with all kinds of big flavors and aromatics. My father was a huge fan of brandy, and when he was on his deathbed, I brought him a 1951 Cognac from Delamain. The year he came to America from Italy was 1951. He was incredibly ill when we busted into it at his bedside with my sisters and my brothers gathered around, but he was so game about it. He took on this very strong spirit when he was so sick. I was very much brought back down to Earth by my father\u2019s death. It really brought it home. You know that people die, but when you see your father die in front of you, you understand that you\u2019re going to die. If I\u2019m on my deathbed, I\u2019m sure going to have something strong. You\u2019re looking back on your life, so I would want something strong, sweet, and bitter.\n\nThe Erin\n\nINGREDIENTS:\n\n2 oz New York Distilling Company Ragtime Rye\n\n.5 oz Bigallet China-China Amer Liqueur\n\n.5 oz Suze\n\n.5 oz Sweet vermouth (preferably equal parts Cinzano Rosso and Carpano Antica Formula)\n\n5 dashes St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram\n\nGlass: Double Old-Fashioned\n\nGarnish: Lemon twist and orange twist\n\nDIRECTIONS:\n\nAdd the rye, China-China, Suze, vermouth, and allspice dram to a mixing glass and fill with ice.
