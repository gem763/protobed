And, they warn, it\u2019s not just Biden\u2019s problem to tackle.\n\n\u201cI think the other candidates should all recognize that it may be Joe Biden in the barrel today but it could just as easily be them tomorrow if Trump decides any of them emerge as the Democratic nominee,\u201d said Brian Fallon, who served as Clinton\u2019s press secretary in 2016. \u201cIt is a problem that needs to be tended to by the party as a whole. It is not a Joe Biden problem. It is a party problem.\u201d\n\nKaren Finney, a political consultant and former spokesperson for the Clinton campaign, said the Biden campaign has done a good job calling attention to Team Trump\u2019s tactic of creating a false equivalence between Joe and Hunter Biden and what Trump reportedly said during a phone call with the Ukrainian president. But she warned that the onslaught was just starting. \u201cEverybody get ready, because this is what 2020 is going to be like every day,\u201d Finney said.\n\nThe fears expressed by multiple Clinton veterans underscore the difficult task at hand for team Biden, the current front-runner in the Democratic primary. Going after Trump for encouraging or even pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate allegations of corruption involving Hunter Biden may seem like the only move at hand, but it runs the risk of elevating the attacks on his son even further.\n\n\u201cThe key piece of advice is to never repeat the negative,\u201d said Zac Petkanas, a former senior adviser to Clinton who ran her 2016 campaign\u2019s rapid response effort. \u201cNever accept the premise of the question. The only thing the Biden campaign should say about the substance of the attack is that it has been debunked.\u201d\n\nFor now, the former vice president\u2019s team sees no other choice than to rebut the president and his team head on.\n\n\u201cThis is a situation where there is no question about whether us reacting to it gives it more oxygen,\u201d said Anita Dunn, an adviser to the Biden campaign. \u201cWhen the president, his personal of lawyer, the secretary of the treasury, the secretary of state, and every other person they can find is out there raising the issue, when the president decides to tweet or talk to the press, he is elevating the issue regardless of whatever we are doing. The question then becomes: What is the most effective way to combat it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be direct, call it out for what it is, be aggressive, and won\u2019t back down,\u201d Dunn added. \u201cI hope the media has taken some lessons from 2016 on this too, because the media tries to play by a set of rules and Trump knows what those rules are, and uses them to his advantage because he doesn\u2019t play by any rules.\u201d\n\nThose who have worked on campaigns past don\u2019t quibble with the approach. But there are fears that Biden\u2019s campaign has already made errors. One Clinton vet noted that Hunter Biden told The New Yorker in July that he had spoken to his father about his Ukraine work, in contrast to the former vice president\u2019s assertion that the topic was never discussed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an inconsistency,\u201d said the former Clinton aide, who asked for anonymity in order to speak freely. \u201cThey should get their facts in order and push back hard on substance so that everyone can have confidence that this won\u2019t be a real issue for his campaign.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has, in recent days, denied any wrongdoing. It\u2019s also gone after Trump, his allies, and reporters for suggesting there\u2019s any validity to the claim. During a press gaggle in Iowa, Biden called Trump\u2019s conduct an apparent \u201coverwhelming abuse of power.\u201d And his spokesman, Andrew Bates, told The Daily Beast that Trump had debased the presidency, \u201cremind[ing] the American people of something he made clear long ago: He will always put himself before his country.\u201d\n\nPhilippe Reines, a longtime Clinton confidant, said the best course of action for Biden\u2019s team moving forward is to \u201cjust let it rip.\u201d Biden, he said \u201cshould just breathe fire and say, \u2018Look, you\u2019re lying.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo that end, in a strongly worded memo sent to some members of the media on Saturday, Biden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield pushed any media outlet covering Trump\u2019s allegations to \u201cstate at the outset that there is no factual basis for Trump\u2019s claims,\u201d asserting that failure to do so \u201cis misleading readers and viewers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe inescapable news from this week is that Donald Trump, in order to damage the potential Democratic nominee he fears the most\u2014and who, as Joe Biden said Saturday, polls consistently show would \u2018beat him like a drum\u2019\u2014may very well have perpetrated an abuse of presidential power that has never before taken place in American history,\u201d the memo read.\n\nTrump himself has not shied away from the accusation that he encouraged the president of Ukraine to launch an investigation into Hunter Biden\u2019s work as part of conversations about sending military aid to the country. He has suggested he\u2019d even be comfortable with a transcript of the call being made public, all while insisting that the real scandal involves the former vice president\u2019s encouragement that a Ukrainian prosecutor looking into the Hunter Biden-tied company be sacked. Several reports have noted that other officials, including many European governments, wanted the Ukrainian prosecutor gone on grounds that he was corrupt.\n\nThe chaotic fallout has prompted many Clinton allies to draw comparisons to the allegations they were tasked with responding to in the lead-up to the 2016 general election. During that campaign, Clinton faced months of scrutiny over her use of a private email server, the workings of her family\u2019s charitable foundation, and revelations that she\u2019d exchanged more than 100 emails that contained classified information. She struggled with how to respond to the steady drip of news and hesitated for weeks over whether to apologize.\n\nBut by the end of the cycle, she and her team came to believe that the news media\u2019s coverage of the controversies lacked any proportionality\u2014certainly when compared to the coverage devoted to Trump. Reflecting on that now, Fallon called the stories of Clinton\u2019s wrongdoings \u201cbanana peels\u201d that would have the effect of making them slip up. Biden, he warned, would be wise to simply avoid stepping on them at all.\n\n\u201cTrying to sort of duke it out in the press every day is not a recipe for long-term success,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cYou might get the better of any given cycle, but it won\u2019t alter the trajectory of the story or shift the press off the mindset of probing any merits of whatever controversy Trump is trying to fan around your candidacy.\u201d", "description": "Those who were on the receiving end of the last Trump campaign onslaught are having some seriously maddening d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu right now.", "authors": ["Hanna Trudo", "Jackie Kucinich", "Sam Stein", "Washington Bureau Chief", "Politics Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569272189/190923-jackie-biden-tease_jjgafn", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
