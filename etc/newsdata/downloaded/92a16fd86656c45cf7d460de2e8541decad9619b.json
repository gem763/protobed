This preoccupation has been increasing over the course of the last year or two.''\n\n\n\nThe statement continues that ''Given that the IRR has such strong opinions about the DA's leadership and internal debates, they are more than welcome to become members of the DA and exercise their membership rights to participate in the DA\u2019s next Congress, at which the party\u2019s leadership will be elected, instead of sniping from the side-lines and shamelessly piggy-backing their fundraising appeals on to it.\n\n\"Given their obsession with the DA, the other option for the IRR is to form their own political party and contest elections in its own name \u2013 rather than attempt to piggy-back on the DA\u2019s successes in government, as it is currently trying to do while fronting as an NPO.\"\n\nThe fracas occurs in the context of what DA leader Mmusi Maimane has called a \"smear campaign\".\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago the City Press reported that Maimane had declared a R4m house in the Cape Town suburb in a parliamentary register, despite the home never belonging to him.\n\nIn a separate article, the Sunday Times reported that Maimane was recently pushed hard by senior DA member of Parliament Mike Waters over the circumstances of his rental of a R4m home in Claremont, Cape Town.\n\nIt was also reported over the weekend that Maimane had driven around in a car that was a gift from former Steinhoff boss Markus Jooste.\n\nOn Sunday, Rapport revealed that Maimane used the white Toyota Fortuner from Jooste for months, after indicating that it would be returned.\n\nBusiness Day reported on Wednesday that the The DA has prioritised a probe into the allegations around Maimane's car and house after he called for it.\n\nActing federal chair Thomas Walters said that the party's internal finance committee, tasked with the probe, would conduct a fact check regarding Maimane's resources and go to the federal executive if there was anything to report.", "description": "The DA has rejected ''with contempt'' the ''naked opportunism'' displayed by the Institute of Race Relations with its ''latest missive''.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8905/f23f3dfbea6743c3b7b5aa4dcc6cee9c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
