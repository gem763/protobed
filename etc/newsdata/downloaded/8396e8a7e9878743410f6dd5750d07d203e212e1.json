Elizabeth Warren says would raise nearly $3 trillion.\n\nSince the tax would target wealth rather than income, the government would have to value the assets of wealthy households. Fudging and cheating would be rampant. There are also legal problems with a wealth tax, which may violate an arguably outdated clause in the U.S. Constitution.\n\nStill, it could happen. Uncle Sam is running alarming, trillion-dollar deficits that at some point could necessitate large new sources of revenue. A wealth tax would do the trick. If Democrats take control of the government in the 2020 elections\u2014including the Senate\u2014they\u2019ll need new funding sources for expensive new programs they plan to roll out. And Congress could probably write a law able to withstand court challenges to the constitutionality of a wealth tax.\n\nBut the strongest case for a wealth tax would come when the next recession strikes. America\u2019s aristocrats have been doing great, enjoying the lion\u2019s share of stock-market gains during an 11-year bull rally and capturing a record share of the nation\u2019s overall wealth. The middle class, by contrast, has eked out modest gains, at best. Recessions always hurt lower-income workers the most, and the next one could generate unstoppable political pressure to rectify the growing gap between the rich and the rest.\n\nBulk of wealth comes from investments, business income\n\nWarren\u2019s wealth tax would impose an annual 2% surtax on wealth above $50 million, and a 3% surtax on wealth above $1 billion. There would be problems valuing the assets of the wealthy, which typically include privately owned business, real estate, art and other illiquid assets that don\u2019t have an obvious market price. But Switzerland, Spain, France and Norway have figured out how to do it. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley estimate this tax would raise $275 billion per year. Warren would use the money to cover a student debt payoff, free college for many students, universal child care and other new programs.\n\nSimply raising the top income-tax rate might be a more straightforward way to raise revenue, and there are no questions about its legality. But Warren favors a wealth tax because the wealthy don\u2019t actually earn all that much from ordinary labor at a job. Households with incomes above $53 million earned just 10% of that money from labor, according to research by Lily Batchelder and David Kamin of New York University School of Law. The other 90% comes from capital gains, dividends and business income. So most of that income is taxed under capital gains and business rates that are lower than taxes on income. Ordinary workers, by contrast, earn little of their income from investments taxed at the lower rates.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen.

And you could set the threshold lower than $50 million if you wanted to raise more revenue. There\u2019s about $11 trillion of wealth in households above the $50 million threshold, but $21 trillion of wealth if you lower the threshold to $10 million. So there\u2019d be more wealth to tax, and therefore more revenue to obtain.\n\nSaez and Zucman estimated how a Warren-style wealth tax would affect some well-known billionaires if it had been in place since 1982. Jeff Bezos\u2019s net worth would have dropped from $160 billion without the wealth tax to $87 billion with it. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s wealth would have dropped from $61 billion to $44 billion. Warren Buffett would take a bigger hit because he\u2019s older and would have been subject to the annual wealth tax for longer. His net worth would have dropped from $88 billion to $30 billion. It\u2019s hard to argue the megarich would suffer even if their net worth were cut in half.", "description": "Forces could be aligning for a new kind of tax on the wealthy.", "authors": ["Rick Newman", "Senior Columnist"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GzDlFBmcXgXHlDRKzVn.Aw--~B/aD0xNDAwO3c9MjEwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/2055c130-d57d-11e9-bf65-bd25ae123717", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
