The idea that it is essentially a complicated exchange of goods and money for a physical service is outdated, according to Scull\u2019s findings.\n\n\"Sugar friendships,\u201d for instance, involve a more platonic interaction. A step up from that would be \u201csugar friendships with benefits\u201d in which the partners aren't seeing each other exclusively, but engage in some level of physical intimacy while the older man funds a more luxurious lifestyle for the younger woman. \u201cSugar dating,\u201d as the term might suggest, mirrors a traditional relationship more closely.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "Variations range from compensated dating to sugar friendships with benefits\u00a0and pragmatic love, a new study finds.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/iStock-Selfie.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
