Giggs, meanwhile, suggested James had exaggerated his reaction to the fall.\n\nGareth Bale popped up at the pivotal moment to lash the ball across goal to equalise for Wales\n\nThe Real Madrid star let out a roar of celebration after hauling his nation back into the tie\n\nPLAYER RATINGS Wales (4-2-3-1): Hennessey 7; C Roberts 6, Lockyer 6, Rodon 6, B Davies 7; Ampadu 5 (Morrell 50, 6), Allen 7; Bale 7, J Williams 7 (Wilson 68, 6), James 6; Moore 7 T Roberts 86, 6) Subs not used: Ward, A Davies, Gunter, Taylor, A Williams, Vokes, Lawrence, Matondo, Vaulks. Croatia (4-2-3-1): Livakovic 6; Jedvaj 6, Lovren 5, Vida 7, Barisic 6; Modric 6 (Badelj 90, 6), Kovacic 7 (Rakitic 46, 6); Perisic 6, Vlasic 7, Brekalo 7; Petkovic 6 (Rebic 64, 6). Subs not used: Kalinic, Sluga, Melnjak, Peric, Orsic, Bradaric, Skoric, Pasalic, Bartolec. Referee: Bjorn Kuipers 5 Attendance: 31,745\n\n'I talk about players being smart and he (James) was smart,' said Giggs. 'He stayed down [after the challenge]. He told the doctors 'yeah, I'm just not moving, I'm just sitting still.'\n\n'Not to get anyone sent off, but using his nous. At half-time, he did all the concussion tests and he was fine.' James added: 'He caught me in the head. I didn't get knocked out.'\n\nIf Wales finish level on points with Slovakia, they will end the group above them thanks to a better head-to-head record. Victories against Azerbaijan and Hungary in their last two qualifiers are paramount.\n\nIf they achieve that, they must hope Slovakia \u2013 who have 10 points to Wales' eight \u2013 stumble in their final two games, in Croatia and at home to Azerbaijan. Two wins for Slovakia would probably consign Wales to the play-offs, thanks to Giggs' team's performance in the Nations League. 'We showed character, commitment and quality,' said Giggs. 'These two games are a step forward.'\n\nIn a bruising encounter, James' team-mate Ethan Ampadu had to be substituted soon after the break after feeling the full force of Bruno Petkovic's forearm in the back of his neck.\n\nFormer Everton man Nikola Vlasic had opened the scoring for Croatia in Cardiff\n\nVlasic was mobbed by his team-mates as Wales players tried to regather themselves\n\nBale also looked to be struggling at the end \u2013 though coach Ryan Giggs said he was suffering from cramp \u2013 while substitute Harry Wilson was hobbling after being blocked by Luka Modric.\n\nCroatia were also furious that Bale's goal was allowed to stand as they believed Ben Davies had fouled Mateo Kovacic before playing the decisive pass.\n\nCroatia bossed the majority of the opening exchanges and took the lead through former Everton midfielder Vlasic, but let in Bale with the interval approaching. Wales finished the stronger to leave even Modric increasingly rattled.\n\nWales \u2013 unchanged in Aaron Ramsey's continued absence through injury \u2013 approached the game with confidence after their encouraging 1-1 draw in Slovakia, but Croatia went in front after nine minutes.\n\nJosip Brekalo slalomed down the left before feeding centre-forward Petkovic. His lay-off to the edge of the box was struck first-time by Vlasic, and the ball went in off the inside of the left post.\n\nMoments earlier, Wales had asked for a penalty for Dejan Lovren's clumsy shove on James. At the other end, Wayne Hennessey did well to deny Ivan Perisic after he met Petkovic's cross with a precise downward header.\n\nDaniel James was involved in a horror collision which left players fearing for his safety\n\nThe Manchester United man was left prone on the ground as medics rush over to attend\n\nJames was involved a moment of genuine alarm in the 14th minute when he challenged Vida for a high ball and fell heavily, flat on his back. Players from both sides looked worried but the wide man was cleared after treatment from doctors, which delayed the match by three minutes. Vida was booked for his part in it.\n\nCroatia slowly let their intensity drop and were made to pay in first-half stoppage time when Davies swapped passes with Bale and released the Real Madrid man, who slipped away from Lovren and drilled the ball past Dominik Livakovic.\n\nCroatia were furious as Kovacic looked to have been fouled by Davies in the build-up, and Lovren was booked for protesting.\n\nShortly after half-time, Ampadu needed two minutes of treatment after the clash with Petkovic and was replaced by Joe Morrell. Petkovic was perhaps lucky to receive only a yellow card\n\nMidfielder Joe Allen was booked late on, meaning he will miss Wales' next qualifying clash\n\nWhen play resumed, Modric was robbed by Williams, who sent James clear for an angled shot that Livakovic gathered at the second attempt. Wales midfielder Joe Allen collected a late booking that ensures he misses next month's trip to Azerbaijan, but he will be eligible for the finale against Hungary here.\n\nAs Wales strived for a winner, Modric was booked in the closing minutes for a cynical bodycheck on Wilson. Modric was injured in fouling the forward and was booed by most of the ground as he was replaced by Milan Badelj. Neither side could find a winner in the eight added minutes.\n\nCroatia still have work to do to be certain of top spot and coach Zlatko Dalic said: 'We're not happy with this result. It's up to us to solve it in the final game.'", "description": "TOM COLLOMOSSE AT THE CARDIFF CITY STADIUM: Gareth Bale had Wales daring to dream of a Euro 2020 place, on a night when Daniel James suffered a sickening blow to the head.", "authors": ["Tom Collomosse For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/21/19665086-0-image-a-31_1570999086599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
