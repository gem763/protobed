But back in Houston\u2019s Minute Maid Park, where Washington had opened the Series with two consecutive wins, the Nationals were able to ride the mastery of starter Stephen Strasburg to a 7-2 over Justin Verlander and the Astros, dropping the Houston ace to 0-6 for his career in the Fall Classic.\n\nThe Nationals took the lead with a second-deck homer by Juan Soto in the fifth inning that made it 3-2. They then added two more runs on an Anthony Rendon homer in a tumultuous seventh inning, when Trea Turner was called out for interference, and Nationals Manager Dave Martinez was ejected for arguing the call. Rendon wasn\u2019t done, though, and he added some cushion in the ninth with a two-out double that drove in two runs. Strasburg dominated the Astros\u2019 potent lineup, holding them scoreless after the first inning and only coming out with one out in the ninth inning.\n\nThere has never been a World Series in which road teams won all seven games, but if the Nationals are looking for inspiration as they try to win the complete their championship hunt in enemy territory, they need look no further than the 2016 Chicago Cubs. Those Cubs found themselves in a three-games-to-one deficit against the Cleveland Indians only to win Game 5 at home and Games 6 and 7 in Cleveland.", "description": "Home runs from Adam Eaton, Juan Soto and Anthony Rendon, along with an outstanding outing from Stephen Strasburg, helped Washington send the series to a decisive Game 7.", "authors": ["David Waldstein", "Benjamin Hoffman"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/sports/29series-live-1/29series-live-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
