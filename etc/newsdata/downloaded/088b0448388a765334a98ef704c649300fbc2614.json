And border watchers say it\u2019s largely because of an agreement Trump struck with Mexico in June. Mexican authorities, backed by the newly formed National Guard, are now cracking down on migrants traversing Mexico\u2019s southern border with Guatemala, monitoring river crossings and stopping buses carrying migrants from Central America through Mexico. At the same time, the U.S. is making tens of thousands of asylum seekers wait in Mexico while their applications are considered.\n\nThe decline in border traffic \u2014 if sustained \u2014 could amount to a major victory for Trump as he heads into the 2020 election. Perhaps more important, the experimental measures taken by his administration could reshape immigration enforcement for years to come.\n\n\u201cI think that they are getting exactly what they said they would get, by forcing the hand of Mexico,\u201d said Oscar Chac\u00f3n, executive director of Chicago-based pro-migrant group Alianza Americas. \u201cBut the question is, \u2018Is it sustainable?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe White House and the Homeland Security Department did not respond to requests for comment. But Mexican Ambassador to the U.S. Martha B\u00e1rcena told POLITICO that steps taken since June have produced meaningful results.\n\n\u201cPeople know that if they come into Mexico, they have to respect the Mexican law,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said. She added that migrants planning to seek asylum in the U.S. now understand that it\u2019s \u201cnot as easy as they were told it was going to be.\u201d\n\nTrump praised Mexico\u2019s actions to reduce the migrant flow in a tweet Saturday that quoted Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, saying Mexico was \u201cstepping up to the plate and doing what they need to do.\u201d\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence will meet in Washington Tuesday with Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard and other officials to discuss the counter-migration measures, according to Mexican officials.\n\nMexico\u2019s delegation will press the U.S. to process asylum cases faster, as migrants from Central America and elsewhere pile up in Mexican border towns. It will also push for increased aid to Central America and efforts to stop the flow of guns from the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nThe Mexico agreement followed threats from Trump to impose across-the-board escalating tariffs on Mexican goods that would likely have resulted in severe economic costs on both sides of the border. When the agreement was announced, it was widely interpreted as a fig leaf that would allow Trump to back down but wouldn\u2019t likely have much impact on migration.\n\nBut the deal's components appear to have contributed to the steep drop in border arrests, according to interviews with six former officials and advocates both for and against greater levels of immigration, as well as a POLITICO analysis of enforcement data.\n\nBorder arrests soared through the spring as Central American families trekked north in record numbers. The surge in arrivals overwhelmed U.S. border facilities and ignited a political battle over whether Democrats or Republicans shouldered the blame for the sudden influx, which peaked with 133,000 border arrests in May.\n\nThen arrests fell to 95,000 in June and 72,000 in July. The June and July drops fit a seasonal pattern in earlier years, but the August decline did not. Border arrests have typically increased in August during the past decade.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s base is likely to be pleased, advocates for immigrants say the drop in arrests could be bad for asylum seekers.\n\n\u201cWhat the numbers show is that the United States\u2019 threats and bullying of other countries have been effective in getting other countries to increase their enforcement efforts, but that the numbers don\u2019t reflect any real change in the situation of the Northern Triangle countries of Central America,\u201d said Maureen Meyer, a director for Mexico and migrant rights with the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy organization.\n\nThe deal with Mexico focuses on two main areas: heightened enforcement by Mexican authorities and the expansion of \u201cremain in Mexico,\u201d which is formally known as the Migrant Protection Protocols.", "description": "Border arrests are plummeting after Trump crackdown.", "authors": ["Ted Hesson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Rmm9Xej9wuYNlPeT3d0Szw--~B/aD03NzM7dz0xMTYwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/90cf44d9a30f4b740fab1d5bb495beee", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
