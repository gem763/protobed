Therefore, based on both media & Democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the host site for the G-7 in 2020,\u201d the president continued. \u201cWe will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!\u201d\n\nThe choice of the Trump National Doral was widely condemned as the most egregious example yet of the president abusing his position to enrich himself and his business. The resort was in need of a boost: in May the Washington Post reported that Doral\u2019s operating income had fallen 69% since 2015.\n\nThe president deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry. Noah Bookbinder, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington\n\nTrump\u2019s u-turn was welcomed by ethics watchdogs. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to award the G7 Conference to his own property was outrageous, corrupt and a constitutional violation.\n\n\u201cIt was stunningly corrupt even for a stunningly corrupt administration. His reversal of that decision is a bow to reality, but does not change how astonishing it was that a president ever thought this was appropriate, or that it was something he could get away with.\u201d\n\nThe outcome shows that pressure works, even on Trump, Bookbinder added. \u201cThe president deserves no plaudits for doing the right thing only after public outcry forced him not to do the wrong thing. This was one corrupt conflict of interest. He\u2019s racked up well over 2,000 of them. So we\u2019ll keep fighting. Even late on a Saturday night.\u201d\n\nWalter Shaub, former director of the Office of Government Ethics, tweeted: \u201cBlam! Never doubt that the public\u2019s efforts to hold this corrupt administration accountable is worth all the effort!! Remember this, my friends, as we continue to fight for the integrity of our government and for democracy.\u201d\n\nWhen the venue announcement was made on Thursday by White House acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who claimed that Doral \u201cwas millions of dollars cheaper\u201d than other facilities, Democrats immediately vowed to investigate.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted: \u201cThe constitution is clear: the president cannot accept gifts or payments from foreign governments. No one is above the law.\u201d House judiciary committee chairman Jerrold Nadler described the move as \u201camong the most brazen examples yet of the president\u2019s corruption\u201d.\n\nThe backlash came with Trump already facing an impeachment inquiry in the Democratic-led House of Representatives and a backlash from Republicans over his decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria, abandoning Kurdish allies. A number of congressional investigations are also scrutinising Trump\u2019s finances and potential conflicts of interest stemming from his property business.\n\nThe US constitution\u2019s emoluments clause prohibits government officials from receiving salaries, fees or profits from foreign and domestic governments without congressional approval.", "description": "US president says media and Democrats forced him to ditch plan to award himself the opportunity to host summit", "authors": ["David Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c0886605d3dbc48ee9b50f98ad65301944e833f/0_406_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bfa01ab0f7f0c7448401cecbcb2577db", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
