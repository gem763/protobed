Seventeen years after the princess\u2019s death, Helena Bonham Carter (who plays Margaret on season three of The Crown) Goop-ily contacted the royal family member through a psychic medium to get her blessing for the role. \u201cMy main thing when you play someone who is real, you kind of want their blessing because you have a responsibility,\u201d the actress explained at the Cheltenham Literature Festival per The Guardian. And that responsibility includes taking acting tips from a spirit (or from a random psychic medium pretending to be the spirit of the queen\u2019s only sister \u2014 it\u2019s player\u2019s choice).\n\n\u201cSo I asked her,\u201d Bonham Carter recalled, \u201c\u2018Are you OK with me playing you?\u2019 and she said: \u2018You\u2019re better than the other actress\u2019 \u2026 that they were thinking of. They will not admit who it was. It was me and somebody else. That made me think maybe she is here, because that is a classic Margaret thing to say. She was really good at complimenting you and putting you down at the same time.\u201d Tea from beyond the grave? Listening \u2026 \u201cThen she said: \u2018But you\u2019re going to have to brush up and be more groomed and neater,\u2019\u201d Bonham Carter recounted. \u201cThen she said: \u2018Get the smoking right. I smoked in a very particular way. Remember that \u2014 this is a big note \u2014 the cigarette holder was as much a weapon for expression as it was for smoking.\u2019\u201d\n\nAside from checking in with a dead person, Helena Bonham Carter did other, serious research on Princess Margaret\u2019s life, including speaking to three of her former ladies-in-waiting, relatives, and close friends. Seems everyone and Princess Margaret\u2019s spirit will be keeping an eye out for a deadly cigarette holder when The Crown returns for season three on November 17.", "description": "Star of \u2018The Crown\u2019 season three, Helena Bonham Carter spoke to Princess Margaret through a psychic medium to get her approval.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/07/07-helena-bonham-carter.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
