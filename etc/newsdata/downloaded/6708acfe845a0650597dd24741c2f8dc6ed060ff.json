Dick, a follower of the rebel Jack Cade, knows that before their insurrection can succeed, they have to get rid of the defenders of law and order.\n\nWe are seeing a disturbingly similar strategy unfold in American politics. Except that this time, they want to kill all the journalists.\n\nThe 2018 massacre at a newsroom in Annapolis and ongoing violence and threats against reporters make the analogy a rather sensitive one, so let's emphasize that it's only that -- analogy. The people we're talking about aren't actually out to kill journalists, just their credibility.\n\nTom Wright-Piersanti is the latest victim. According to a report in Sunday\u2019s New York Times, Wright-Piersanti, a Times editor, was targeted by \u201ca loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House.\u201d Their aim: Discredit news organizations they consider hostile to Donald Trump. Their strategy: posting damaging or embarrassing information about journalists.\n\nSo last week, after the Times ran two pieces unflattering to the Trump White House, this group unveiled on Breitbart some racist and anti-Semitic tweets Wright-Piersanti wrote 10 years ago. He has apologized and expressed \u201cdeep shame\u201d for \u201clame attempts at edgy humor\u201d -- and also, in essence, for being a millennial.\n\n\u201cFor my generation, the generation that came of age in the internet,\u201d he said, \u201call the youthful mistakes that you made get preserved in digital amber, and no matter how much you change and mature and grow up, it\u2019s always out there, waiting to be discovered.\u201d The Times said it was looking into what it dubbed \u201ca clear violation of our standards.\u201d\n\nOne need not condone Wright-Piersanti's old tweets to note that whatever offensive thing he said, he said 10 years ago when he was in college. The last offensive thing Trump said was less than 10 days ago, and he is in the White House.\n\nBut there is far more at stake here than one man's career. A president who has branded journalists \"enemies of the people\" and news media \"an evil propaganda machine\" now has working on his behalf an anti-journalism hit squad. These people are nothing less than termites in the woodwork of freedom.\n\nBeyond Wright-Piersanti, they\u2019re also said to have targeted reporters from the Washington Post, Business Insider and CNN. Like him, most were in their teens or early 20s when they penned the offensive posts. Arthur Schwartz, a conservative political consultant and friend of Donald Trump Jr., described by the Times as a central figure in the campaign, says it has only just begun. The group claims to have done deep dives into the digital histories of numerous journalists -- and their family members.\n\n\"Lots more where that came from,\" he tweeted last week.\n\nTo which journalism as an institution must respond: Bring it.\n\nYes, some people may be embarrassed, some careers damaged. But bring it. Because truth itself is facing a hostile takeover. Because the machinery of authoritarianism is being assembled before our eyes. Because the people's right to know is sacred. And because without an informed electorate, democracy is not possible.\n\nSee, this group understands what Dick the Butcher did not. The first thing you do is \"kill\" not the lawyers, but the reporters.\n\nThen you can do whatever you want to the lawyers, and no one will even know.\n\nLeonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald, 3511 NW 91st Ave., Miami, Fla., 33172.
