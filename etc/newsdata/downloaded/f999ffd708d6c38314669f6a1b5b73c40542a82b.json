The judge said that the information about Khashoggi's disappearance and death is of \"considerable public importance.\"\n\nRepresentatives from the departments argued that complying with the order for the documents under the Freedom of Information Act would make it impossible to respond to other FOIA requests.\n\nThe original request for the government's documents was made by the Open Society Justice Initiative, the legal arm of the Open Society Foundations. The group filed suit in January seeking the immediate release of all government records related to the killing of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident.\n\nKhashoggi was last seen alive entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Critics of the Trump administration say the U.S. government has not acted forcefully enough against the government of Saudi Arabia, which is widely believed to have had a hand in the journalist's death.\n\nEngelmayer said the Open Society's FOIA request had \"obvious and unusual time sensitivity,\" as quoted by The Associated Press.\n\n\"This ruling is a clarion call for accountability at a time when the Trump administration is doing everything possible to hide the truth on who is responsible for Khashoggi['s] murder,\" said Amrit Singh, the Open Society's lead attorney for the case, in an emailed statement.", "description": "A federal judge says the government must prioritize the release of documents requested under the Freedom of Information Act about the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.", "authors": ["Richard Gonzales"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/08/06/ap_19039262037680_wide-760f6436d80db25379b11cd906ebabec2688b1de.jpg?s=1400"}
