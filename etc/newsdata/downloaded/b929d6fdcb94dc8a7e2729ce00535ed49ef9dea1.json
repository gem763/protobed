(AP) - Fullback Andy Janovich has signed a three-year extension with the Denver Broncos worth $5.7 million.\n\nThe fourth-year pro from Nebraska is making $720,000 this season in the final year of his rookie contract as a sixth-round draft pick. He\u2019s the first member of the Broncos\u2019 2016 draft class to sign a second contract.\n\nJanovich missed the first three games this season after tearing a pectoral muscle in August.\n\nIn a statement, general manager John Elway said, \u201cAndy has developed into one of the best fullbacks in the league. He\u2019s exactly what you look for in a fullback - tough, reliable and a versatile part of not only the offense but also our special teams. It\u2019s nice to see how Andy\u2019s hard work has paid off.\u201d\n\nBehind Janovich\u2019s blocking last season, Phillip Lindsay became the first undrafted offensive rookie to make the Pro Bowl. Also, Lindsay (nine TDs) and Royce Freeman (five TDs) became just the third rookie tandem since the 1970 merger with at least five touchdowns each.\n\nJanovich has three TDs in his career, two rushing and one receiving. He\u2019s also recorded a team-high 16 special teams tackles.\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Fullback Andy Janovich has signed a three-year extension with the Denver Broncos worth $5.7 million.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
