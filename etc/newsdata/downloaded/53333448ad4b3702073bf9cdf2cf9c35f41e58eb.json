But the message was clear: Bennett is expected to stand.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate that being an issue,\u201d Garrett said of Bennett\u2019s history of protest. \u201cWe\u2019re just excited to have him here.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to clarify his statement, Garrett echoed Jones.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate him doing what all of our players do,\u201d Garrett said.\n\nMichael Bennett reportedly agreed to stand for the national anthem prior to being traded to the Cowboys.

I don\u2019t love riots. I don\u2019t love oppression,\u201d when explaining his choice to protest during the anthem.\n\nMichael Bennett will sit during the national anthem for the 2017 season.\n\n\n\nHere's why: pic.twitter.com/oHGODpqWaC \u2014 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) August 14, 2017\n\n\u201cI just want to see people have the equality they deserve,\u201d Bennett continued. \u201cI want to be able to use this platform to continuously push the message.\u201d\n\nBennett has not yet spoken publicly on the issue since being traded to the Cowboys.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Michael Bennett reportedly agreed to stand for the national anthem prior to being traded to the Cowboys.", "authors": ["Jason Owens"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VwqvajblebXWxC.0glXtMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NjAuOA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HQX1ArrbYNFlaLeeZjB1fQ--~B/aD0yMDQ5O3c9MzA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b15988e0-ef83-11e9-9fbf-cf0ccce87f8c", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
