Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., had spent $80 on a haircut and $180 on color at a Washington, D.C., salon, a styling choice the newspaper presented as hypocritical, given she \u201cregularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway.\u201d\n\nAlmost immediately, charges of sexism and superficiality began to fly online (also, a debate about the average price of a woman\u2019s haircut, and how little men seem to understand the cost of certain aspects of life).\n\nOcasio-Cortez herself tweeted out a statement, saying that Vice President Mike Pence \u201cused *taxpayer funds* \u2014 not personal ones \u2014 to spend several thousand haircuts\u2019 worth of public money on a visit to Trump golf courses.\u201d\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss this as mere distraction, except it is also the latest in a long line of hair-related controversies in the corridors of power that have surrounded both men and women. Hair is, it seems, a particularly \u2014 well, tangled, subject. Not to mention an equal-opportunity target.\n\nHillary Clinton acknowledged it in 2014, when she joked that the subtitle of her memoir, \u201cHard Choices,\u201d should be \u201cThe Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It\u2019s Still All About My Hair.\u201d\n\nThough Clinton is probably the most famous hair lightning rod, whether it was her chopping and changing while in the White House as first lady (seen as reflecting the opportunism of her husband\u2019s policies), her I-don\u2019t-care-I\u2019m-getting-down-to-work scrunchies as secretary of state, her John Barrett styling trip while on the campaign trail (average price per cut: $600) or her postelection lank and limp blues, she is far from the only politician scrutinized.\n\nHer husband was also mocked as far back as 1993 for having a plane wait on the tarmac in Los Angeles while he received a trim from Cristophe of Beverly Hills. The New York Times reported: \u201cQuestions about Mr. Clinton\u2019s runway razor cut dominated the White House news briefing today, with the communications director, George Stephanopoulos, scrambling to explain why the populist President tied up one of the country\u2019s busiest airports to have his hair trimmed.\u201d\n\nJohn Edwards, of course, became something of a poster boy for follicular faux pas during the 2007 presidential campaign when it was revealed he had indulged in two haircuts totaling approximately $800 at a time when he was attempting to sell himself as a champion for working class Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s not just an American obsession. In 2016, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, then the president of France, came under fire for a reported $10,000 a month styling bill, which was seen as inappropriate for a socialist (it even got its own hashtag: #Coiffuregate).\n\nDuring the 2015 Canadian election, Justin Trudeau\u2019s hair, which, in its lushness, seemed to represent his youth and privilege, had its own Twitter account \u2014 @TrudeausHair. The Economist referred to him as the \u201chair apparent\u201d (a reference to his father, former Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau). And he wasn\u2019t the only one under a follicular microscope: the hair of all the (all-male) candidates played a fairly public role in that election.\n\nAnd British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s singular flyaway blondness has inspired RTE, the Irish broadcaster, to write that his hair is \u201ckey\u201d to his \u201cpolitical brand,\u201d \u201csymbolizing the chaotic and gaffe-prone style that charms his supporters and appals his critics.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say hair is not just some stringy stuff on the top of our heads.\n\nAccording to Grant McCracken, an anthropologist and author of \u201cBig Hair,\u201d our hair is \u201cour court of deliberation, the place where we contemplate who and what we are.\u201d\n\nIt is visible, accessible, gender-freighted. It has associations with sex, punishment, class and power. It is probably not happenstance that the United States has not elected a bald president since Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961.\n\nWhen it comes to politics, to care too much about hair, to spend too much on it, makes one seen as superficial and vain; focused on yourself at the expense (literally sometimes) of taxpayers. Ignore it and you are sloppy and lack attention to detail. Men have traditionally used their ability to get inexpensive barber-trims as bragging rights and something of a badge of honor. In the Washington Times story, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is lauded for the fact he got his cuts at the Senate Hair Care Services in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building for a mere $20 \u2014 though it is acknowledged that \u201cmen\u2019s haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women\u2019s.\u201d In turn, women have often complained about a double standard in price and scrutiny.", "description": "Hair has once again caused a political tempest in a blow dryer.This week, the Washington Times published a story saying that Rep.
