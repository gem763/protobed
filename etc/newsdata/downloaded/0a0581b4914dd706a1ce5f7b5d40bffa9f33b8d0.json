(CMI) fell in the third quarter as the engine maker struggled with weaker demand overseas.\n\nCummins on Tuesday reported $5.77 billion in quarterly sales, down 3% compared with a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet predicted $5.88 billion in sales.\n\nSales in the U.S. and Canada were flat but dropped 8% in international markets. The company reported an 11% year-over-year decline in sales in its engine business as well as a 6% drop in its components unit.\n\nManufacturers are wrestling with softer growth. Last week, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) lowered its earnings forecast for the year after saying customers are holding off on purchases due to economic uncertainty.\n\nCummins also said Tuesday it believes revenue will fall 2% for 2019. Previously, the Columbus, Ind.-based company expected flat revenue for the year. The company lowered the forecast in part due to lower truck production in North America and other major markets.\n\nCummins reported a quarterly profit of $622 million, or $3.97 a share, compared with $692 million, or $4.28 a share, in the third quarter last year.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, analysts expected $3.83 a share in earnings.\n\nWrite to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 07:57 ET (11:57 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
