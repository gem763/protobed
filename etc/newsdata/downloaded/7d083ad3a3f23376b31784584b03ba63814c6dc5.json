I asked production and the network to name it Charlotte\u2019s for Charlotte Rae, who passed last year,' said Kim.\n\nKim dished that she stayed friends with her co-stars since then, saying: 'Well, we\u2019ve been around each other all the time.'\n\nShe clarified: 'Not all the time, but from the time we started living life after the show ended, to now, we certainly have seen each other, hung out together. Fans, they love when they see us hanging out together.'\n\nKim elaborated: 'Nancy and I went to a Michael McDonald concert last year in New York. Lisa and I did some promotional stuff in Toronto last year. Mindy and I had a pizza party the last time I was here, for a press tour for another project, so we see each other, so it wasn\u2019t like a: \"Oh my gosh!\"'\n\nGlowing: Kim discussed the holiday movie, which is entitled You Light Up My Christmas, with People at a Lifetime event held Tuesday (pictured)\n\nThe New York City native shared: 'If anything, that comes into play when we see the kids, when they see their nephews, my kids, or that sort of thing, or Lisa\u2019s daughter, who is pregnant now, and she was on set. Working together, the three of them are still incredibly wonderful actors.'\n\nKim shared that when she contacted her old co-stars for the Lifetime project 'the girls, they just said, they were first of all, just so proud of me, and they were just like: \"Yeah, I\u2019m in, whatever it is.\" Then, to be able to say: \"Well, what do you want to do? What kind of role do you want to play? What kind of character do you want to be?\"'\n\nShe continued: 'They\u2019re like: \"Really? For real? Yeah, I\u2019d like to do this. Can my character be named after my grandma?\"\n\nThrowback: (from left) Kim starred on the program with Lisa Whelchel, Nancy McKeon, Charlotte Rae and Mindy Cohn; the group are pictured in a publicity shot for The Facts Of Life\n\n'All sorts of things that would just make it fun for them, and at the same time, great little moments, and extra Christmas gifts of whimsy and magic for the fans, and just that sentiment of family, you know? And some inside jokes for fans.'\n\nThe impetus to get the band back together was 'just from the standpoint of, this time of year, this season of family, and nostalgia, and memories, and I said, you know, I\u2019d love to create a series of sequence in a couple of scenes, where we are together.'\n\nThe Facts Of Life was a spin-off of the hit show Diff'rent Strokes and ran largely concurrently with it on NBC from 1979 to 1988.\n\nOne of the guest stars on The Facts Of Life was a young pre-fame George Clooney, who played a handyman called George Burnett on the seventh and eighth seasons.\n\nPremis: Nancy, Kim, Mindy and Lisa played students at an all-girl boarding school, while Charlotte was their dormitory housemother\n\nCharlotte left the show for the final two seasons, at which Cloris Leachman stepped in playing her character's sister.\n\n'Sometimes, it's just time to move on. The show is wonderfully popular, and the public loves all the characters, but I just felt I had done all that I could do with Mrs. Garrett,' Charlotte told the Orlando Sentinel shortly after her departure.\n\n'It's just like Jean Stapleton deciding to leave the role of Edith Bunker when she did. I felt I had investigated every nook and cranny, and for my own stimulation as an actress, it was important for me to move on.'\n\nOrigin story: One of the guest stars on The Facts Of Life was a young pre-fame George Clooney, who played a handyman called George Burnett on the seventh and eighth seasons\n\nYears later, she told the Television Academy that by leaving 'I did a crazy thing, because everyone said: \"Stay and get every nickel. Get every nickel!\" And I thought to myself: \"I know, I know I should. This is my one-time big thing.\" It's a miracle that I got it. You know, a lot of people get on a series and it's not successful.'\n\nShe countered that 'you only live once I think, and I just wanted to have a little more time to travel and to do interesting plays, which I did.'\n\nCharlotte cited a Chicago production of Driving Miss Daisy from 1989, the year the hit film adaptation came out, saying she 'adored' the experience.", "description": "Kim Fields got her The Facts Of Life 'sisters' back together for the Lifetime Christmas movie she is starring in and executive producing.", "authors": ["Sameer Suri For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/00/20108096-0-image-a-26_1571871904184.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
