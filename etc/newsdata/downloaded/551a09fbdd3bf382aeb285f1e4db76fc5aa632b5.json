In 1996, before the ban passed, there were 853 dog bites reported in Prince George\u2019s, 108 of which were from pit bulls or pit bull mixes, said county Health Department spokesman George Lettis. There were 484 dog bites reported in Prince George\u2019s in 2010, 70 of which were from pit bulls or mixes, he said, adding that 2010 is the most recent year for which breed-specific data is available.\n\nAD\n\nThe County Council is considering an overhaul of its animal control code, including stricter penalties for owners who do not care for their dogs. Animal rights activists want to repeal the ban as part of that legislation, but most council members said that is unlikely this year.\n\nAD\n\nPrince George\u2019s is the only jurisdiction in the Washington region with such a ban. The county spends about $570,000 annually on animal control officers, boarding for impounded dogs and euthanizing them, Lowe said.\n\nNational debate over pit bull bans moves to Prince George\u2019s\n\nA second chance: What happened to Michael Vick\u2019s dogs?\n\nAn author says she hoped to advance the debate about pit bulls.
