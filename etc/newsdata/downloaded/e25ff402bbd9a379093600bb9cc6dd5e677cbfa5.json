REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez\n\nThe decision to hold the rate yet again met the predictions of all analysts in a Reuters survey last week. The analysts expect the board to hold the rate until next year.\n\nThe six policymakers present raised 2019 expansion expectations to 3.2% from 3%, moving their figure nearer to the government target of 3.6%.\n\n\u201cThe economy is rebounding, it is rebounding better than what people think,\u201d said Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla, who represents the government on the board.\n\nAnalysts predict growth will reach 3.15% this year.\n\nThe board looks likely to meet analysts\u2019 expectation of rate holds through the end of 2019.\n\n\u201cMy best prediction with the current information is that what could happen is for the rate we have today to be held a few months more,\u201d board chief Juan Jose Echavarria said.\n\nThe decision to keep borrowing costs steady was based on inflation falling toward the bank\u2019s long-term 3% goal, the board said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBasic inflation measures continue around 3%. It is expected that at the end of 2019 these supply shocks will begin to dilute, and inflation will resume its convergence to the target, as reflected in market expectations,\u201d it said.\n\nInflation expectations in the poll were down slightly for the close of 2019 to 3.63%, from 3.66% in last month\u2019s survey, as food prices moderated.\n\nMonday\u2019s meeting included only six of the board\u2019s normal seven members because new member Roberto Steiner has not yet taken up his post.", "description": "Colombia's central bank board unanimously held its benchmark interest rate steady at 4.25% at its meeting on Monday and raised its economic growth prediction for the year, taking it closer to the government's target.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433046744&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M1RD", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
