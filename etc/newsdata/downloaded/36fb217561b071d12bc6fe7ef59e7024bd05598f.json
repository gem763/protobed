Humble and shy, but strong in what he does, he typifies hard work and warrior-like attitude.\n\nTwitter\n\nA two-time national level medallist and five-time gold medallist at state level, he is growing into one of the best karate players in the country. But his interest in the sport was more the doing of fate than his own interest.\n\n\"My first meeting with karate was in 2015, when I started attending the classes for self defence. I started training very well, and my trainer Pankaj Sambli was very impressed with me. He told me I was good, but I could get even better.\"\n\nDon't Miss 430 SHARES 1.4 K SHARES 1.6 K SHARES 206 SHARES 474 SHARES\n\nHis coach was right as in the first year of him taking the sport seriously, Zabir became the state-level champion after winning the gold in the tournament held in home state of Bihar. The win was a spark he needed to get going.\n\nTwitter\n\n\"After I won the gold at state-level, I qualified for the nationals that were held in Delhi. I didn't perform well, but I kept pushing and improving myself.\"\n\nAfter working tirelessly for two years, Bihar native's moment of reckoning finally came in 2017. Having failed to make his mark on national level for two years running, he won silver in 2017.\n\n\"I won gold at state-level and followed it up with a silver medal in the national championship. After winning the silver, I got the opportunity to participate in the South Asian Karate Championships in Sri Lanka.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nNot having any experience at the highest level and traveling to a foreign land for the first time, Zabir went in to the championships as a new kid and a massive underdog. Yet, it didn't faze him as he went on to win a silver for the country.\n\n\"I went there very excited, and I wanted to do well for my country. I gave it my all, and I was happy to have won the silver medal. It was a very special experience.\"\n\nAfter a stellar 2017, in which he made massive gains and developed into a great prospect, he has only grown in confidence and stature.\n\nThe following year, he continued to his international expedition at the Thailand Open Karate Championships in July. It didn't yield any medals, but it was another great experience for Zabir that helped in his growth immensely.\n\nTwitter\n\nHis achievements at state and national level were finally recognised and rewarded - with the state government honouring him on with the sports award and a cheque of \u20b950,000 on the National Sports Day on August 29.\n\nThe same year in December, he would go on to make his debut at the World Karate Series in Shanghai, China. He talks us through the experience,\n\n\"It was my first World Karate Series, and it a big deal. All the top Karate players from across the world were there. I was feeling lucky and I coudn't believe I was part of such a big occasion. It was like a dream.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nIn 2019, Zabir is going from strength to strength. Having won a bronze in national championship, he also make his journey to Turkey where he took par in his second World Karate Series.\n\nHaving won 5 gold medals at state-level, every year since 2015, and two national-level medals, the 22 year-old is a big character and is hitting the right notes.\n\nHis achievements are incredible not because he has won so much at a young age, but more so because there has been no government support at all.\n\n\"The government hasn't helped me in anyway. All the tournaments I have participated in outside India, all the expenses have been born by various sponsors, mostly individuals who have want me to do well.\"\n\nHe is next to participate in World Series in Chile, but needs financial assistance to travel. He has a request for everyone out there.\n\n\"I am participating in Chile next, but the tickets are expensive and coming from a underprivileged family, I can't afford to travel on my own. I request the government and all those who want me to do well for my country, to help me win medals for the country.\"\n\nAfter his soaring reputation, he wants to represent his country at the 2024 Olympics, because he feels the Tokyo Dream will not be realised as he isn't ready.\n\n\"I want to play at the Olympics in 2024, as I'm not ready for next year. I want to work hard and establish myself as a top karate player in the next four years. I want to win gold at World Karate Series and improve my rankings. I want to become the best in the world.\"\n\nZabir Ansari is a fighter and he has shown that - irrespective of all the odds stacked against him, he continues to shine brighter by the day. Yet, for him to continue on his journey and realise his dream, he needs the government, and our support.", "description": "There have been many stories of indomitable spirit and heart - fighting against the odds and winning, yet the tale of Zabir Ansari is uniquely different and inspiring.
