Even a 1.2% rise would mark the lowest rate in a decade.\n\nWTO director-general Roberto Azev\u00eado said businesses are delaying investments and hiring amid the uncertainty, squeezing growth and putting at risk better living standards.\n\n\"The darkening outlook for trade is discouraging but not unexpected,\" he said. \"Resolving trade disagreements would allow WTO member [states] to avoid such costs.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nThe revised WTO forecast comes as uncertainty over Brexit has hit the economy in Europe and just weeks before the US and China are scheduled to meet for another round of trade talks.\n\nThe two countries have already raised tariffs on billions of dollars of each others' exports. The US is due to impose more tariffs on Chinese goods this month.\n\n'Destructive cycle'\n\nMeanwhile US President Donald Trump has also clashed with the EU over trade, while a new trade agreement between the US, Mexico and Canada has yet to be approved in Washington.\n\nUS manufacturing data released separately on Tuesday showed the lowest activity in more than 10 years - a report that sent US stock exchanges lower.\n\nAnalysts said a swift resolution to many of the trade conflicts was unlikely, pointing to previous trade disputes that often lasted years.\n\n\"History suggests it can take a long time for trade conflicts to end and for tariffs to be removed, even for smaller conflicts that go through the official channels,\" analysts for Goldman Sachs wrote in a report issued last week.\n\nThe WTO said it expected growth in trade volumes to accelerate to 2.7% in 2020, but cautioned that any pick-up depends on a return to \"more normal\" trade relations.\n\n\"Risks to the forecast are heavily weighted to the downside and dominated by trade policy,\" the WTO said in its update. \"Further rounds of tariffs and retaliation could produce a destructive cycle of recrimination. \"", "description": "The World Trade Organization has slashed its forecast for trade growth this year by more than half.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F749/production/_109050336_gettyimages-1172103114.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
