Biden.\n\nAndrew Bakaj, lead attorney for the first anonymous whistleblower behind a complaint with the intelligence community inspector general, said his legal team now represents \u201cmultiple whistleblowers\u201d related to President Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\n\u201cIC WHISTLEBLOWER UPDATE: I can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General,\u201d Mr. Bakaj tweeted. \u201cNo further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nAttorney Mark Zaid tweeted that a second whistleblower had direct, \u201cfirst hand knowledge\u201d of the July 25 phone call between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, unlike the first whistleblower, who filed the complaint based on secondhand information.\n\nRep. James A. Himes, Connecticut Democrat, said the emergence of additional whistleblowers is a sign that officials in the executive branch are finally declaring, \u201cMy God, this cannot happen anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s real problem is that his behavior has finally gotten to a place where people are saying, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d Mr. Himes, a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Sunday on the CBS talk show \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Lindsey Graham vows whistleblowers will testify in public if House votes to impeach\n\nIf Republicans were worried about the specter of more whistleblowers, they didn\u2019t show it. Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican, said it reminded him of the drumbeat of 2018 sexual misconduct allegations against now-Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. None of the allegations was proved.\n\n\u201cWhat did we learn in Kavanaugh?\u201d Mr. Graham asked on Fox\u2019s \u201cSunday Futures.\u201d \u201cThat they were coaching witnesses and they were piling on to try to create an impression that Judge Kavanaugh was a flawed human being. This is Kavanaugh all over again.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Mr. Trump accused the \u201cDeep State\u201d of \u201cgoing to the bench\u201d to bolster the first whistleblower complaint, which had been dinged by allegations that the anonymous intelligence official reached out first to the House intelligence committee.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people decide to call themselves whistleblowers about the same telephone call \u2014 a call the president already made public. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that he has done nothing wrong,\u201d White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry centers on Mr. Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden\u2019s involvement with the business dealings of his son Hunter Biden, who gained a seat in 2014 on the board of a Ukrainian energy company despite having no apparent experience in the field.\n\nDemocrats have accused Mr. Trump of pressuring a foreign power to dig up dirt on a political rival by threatening to withhold military aid. The president has insisted he imposed no conditions and pointed to a transcript of the conversation released by the White House.\n\n\u201cThe reason he had very legitimate concerns and reservations about Ukraine was first, corruption \u2014 generalized, it\u2019s endemic, we all know that \u2014 and then specifically about election interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the query has inadvertently put the spotlight on Mr. Biden, who bragged in 2015 about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired by threatening to withhold aid.\n\n\u201cSomebody needs to look at the Bidens, whether or not they violated the law,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cThey sure as hell looked at the Trumps. Somebody needs to look at the Bidens.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she would want her hypothetical vice president\u2019s child to sit on a foreign board, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota Democrat, said she would not, but \u201cthat is not the issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that the vice president did something wrong here,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWhat really matters is that the president was repeatedly trying to get dirt on a political opponent. That is the issue here.\u201d\n\nAt the Service Employees International Union gathering Friday, Mr. Biden told reporters asking about his involvement in Kyiv politics during his vice presidential tenure to refocus on Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else, period. I\u2019m not going to respond to that,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cLet\u2019s focus on the problem. Focus on this man, what he\u2019s doing, that no president has ever done, no president.\u201d\n\nThe White House was expected to send, possibly Monday, a letter to the House Democratic leadership saying it would refuse to cooperate with subpoenas unless the House formalizes the impeachment inquiry with a full-chamber vote, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has avoided.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who called last week for the inquiry to be suspended, said the process has been shrouded in uncertainty and unfairness by, for example, allowing the majority Democrats but not minority Republicans to issue subpoenas.\n\nIn addition, the inquiry is being run by the House intelligence committee \u2014 led by Rep. Adam B. Schiff, California Democrat and a key figure in the whistleblower complaint \u2014 instead of the House Judiciary Committee, meaning the proceedings may be held in secret.\n\n\u201cAnytime we\u2019ve moved forward with impeachment, we had a vote of all of the Congress. Why? Because America lends their voice to 435 members,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said on Fox\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine.\u201d \u201cThey should have a say in their process to start it.\u201d\n\nMrs. Pelosi and other Democrats have argued that the Constitution does not require her to gain the support of the House but said she would have the votes to authorize an impeachment inquiry if she did bring such a resolution to the floor.\n\n\u201cIf Speaker Pelosi did in fact move forward with a floor vote on actually proceeding with an investigation, which as you point out is not required here, there\u2019s no question in my mind that she would have the votes,\u201d Mr. Himes said.\n\nRep. Eliot L. Engel, New York Democrat and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, accused Republicans of \u201cthrowing things into the mix to say, \u2018Well, the Democrats should do this, the Democrats should do that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we should all do is make sure that the integrity of our election stands and that the president isn\u2019t taking something that\u2019s not his to barter with in trying to get goods on Joe Biden\u2019s son that he would withhold,\u201d Mr. Engel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. McCarthy blamed politics for the House speaker\u2019s reluctance to call a vote.\n\n\u201cShe has 31 current members who are Democrats who sit in seats that Trump carried,\u201d Mr. McCarthy said. \u201cShe\u2019ll sit out there and say Republicans are worried. I\u2019m very clear with her: I tried to bring it to the floor twice, and she tabled that vote every time because she\u2019s trying to protect her members and have it both ways.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
