So, too, was the mass shooting early Sunday in Dayton, Ohio \u2014 and the multitude of others in recent years.\n\nIt is clear that this country is suffering from an epidemic that law enforcement and politicians are unable or unwilling to manage.\n\nIn the depths of this crisis lies an opportunity: for you to help end this violence.\n\nYou, singularly, have a greater chance to use your role as the chief executive of the country\u2019s largest retailer and largest seller of guns \u2014 with greater sway over the entire ecosystem that controls gun sales in the United States than any other individual in corporate America.", "description": "Walmart, the country\u2019s largest retailer and seller of guns, should use its vast economic leverage to force corporate America to confront shooting deaths.", "authors": ["Andrew Ross Sorkin"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/05/business/05db-sorkin-guns2/05db-sorkin-guns2-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
