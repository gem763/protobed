Trey Gowdy (R-SC) is no longer a contributor for Fox News, a spokesperson for the network confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nGowdy no longer holds a position as a Fox News contributor \u2014 a role he took on after retiring from Congress this year.\n\n\u201cTrey Gowdy has been terminated and is no longer a contributor,\u201d a Fox News spokesperson told the Hill on Wednesday.\n\nThe development follows reports of the former House Oversight Committee chairman joining President Trump\u2019s legal team in the battle against the House Democrats\u2019 partisan-fueled impeachment efforts. While initially speculatory, the New York Post reports that Gowdy signed on as part of the president\u2019s outside legal counsel.\n\nGowdy\u2019s addition follows a series of back-and-forth between the White House and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). The White House sent a letter \u2014 penned by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone \u2014 to the speaker, informing her that the executive branch will not comply with the impeachment probe, arguing that the inquiry itself lacks \u201cany legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness, or even the most elementary due process protections.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause participating in this inquiry under the current unconstitutional posture would inflict lasting institutional harm on the Executive Branch and lasting damage to the separation of powers, you have left the President no choice,\u201d the letter read.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the duties of the President of the United States, and in particular his obligation to preserve the rights of future occupants of his office, President Trump cannot permit his Administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d it added.\n\nPelosi responded, calling the letter \u201cmanifestly wrong\u201d and \u201canother unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration\u2019s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the White House\u2019s stonewalling, we see a growing body of evidence that shows that President Trump abused his office and violated his oath to \u2018protect, preserve and defend the Constitution,\u201d she claimed.\n\n\u201cMr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable,\u201d the speaker added.\n\nInternal polling suggests that pursuing impeachment will hurt Democrats in vulnerable congressional districts, as the majority of voters in those districts do not view Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky an \u201cimpeachable offense.\u201d Despite that, Democrats in the House are largely using the conversation as a basis for the impeachment inquiry.", "description": "Former Rep.
