REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.11% while Japan's Nikkei .N225 shed 0.61%. U.S. stock futures ESc1 gained 0.24% in early trade, paring back almost a half of Friday's 0.53% fall in the index.\n\nThe offshore Chinese yuan was little moved at 7.1339 yuan per dollar CNH=, off Friday's three-week low of 7.1520 to the dollar.\n\nChinese share markets will trade only on Monday this week ahead of China\u2019s National Day holiday, which runs until Oct. 7.\n\nRisk assets took a hit in U.S. trade on Friday following the news that the Trump administration is considering radical new financial pressure tactics on Beijing, including the possibility of delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nThe report knocked Chinese shares listed on U.S. exchanges, with Alibaba Group Holding (BABA.N) falling 5.15% and JD.com (JD.O) 5.95% on Friday.\n\nThe delisting of Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges was part of a broader effort to limit U.S. investment in Chinese companies, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWhile China runs a current account surplus and is a net creditor nation, Chinese companies are net debtors and rely on foreign capital,\u201d Koji Fukaya, president of Office Fukaya Consulting.\n\n\u201cWashington seems to be trying to limit Chinese companies\u2019 activities by putting pressure on their funding,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, with trade talks between the United States and China expected to be held Oct. 10-11, many market players are sticking to hopes such drastic measures on capital markets could be avoided.\n\n\u201cAt this point, markets will have to wait and see. Of course we need to be guarded against more crazy headlines, but this week could be a bit calmer given holidays in China. Economic data will likely be the main driver for markets,\u201d said Kyosuke Suzuki, director of forex at Societe Generale.\n\nSurveys on Chinese companies are due on Monday while in the United States, key business sentiment data and an employment report will be closely scrutinized on clues on how the economy is faring in the face of the ongoing tussle with China.\n\nU.S. data on Friday showed consumer spending barely rose in August and business investment remained weak, suggesting the American economy was losing momentum as the trade dispute drags on.\n\nIndustrial output in Japan and South Korea, released Monday morning, dropped more than expected, underscoring the headwinds from the trade war.\n\nInvestors are also keeping a wary eye on U.S. politics.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that public opinion is now on the side of an impeachment inquiry against Trump following the release of new information about his conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\n\nMajor currencies were little changed in early trade.\n\nThe yen traded flat at 107.94 yen JPY=.\n\nThe euro hovered at $1.0945 EUR=, having sunk to a 28-month low of $1.0904 on Friday as concerns about tepid growth in Europe weighed on the common currency.\n\nSterling traded at $1.2294 GBP=D4, not far from Friday's low of $1.2270, its lowest since Sept. 9.\n\nBoris Johnson said on Sunday he would not quit as Britain\u2019s prime minister even if he fails to secure a deal to leave the European Union, insisting only his Conservative government can deliver Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nOil prices slightly bounced off a tad after last week\u2019s slide.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince warned in an interview with CBS program \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d aired on Sunday that crude prices could spike to \u201cunimaginably high numbers\u201d if the world does not come together to deter Iran.\n\nBut crown prince Mohammed bin Salman said he would prefer a political solution to a military one, adding the Sept. 14 attacks on the kingdom\u2019s oil facilities were an act of war by Iran.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures rose 0.34% to $62.12 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained 0.32% to $56.09 per barrel.", "description": "Asian shares and the Chinese yuan were off to a cautious start on Monday as investors looked to how Chinese financial markets will react to the news the U.S. administration is considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435349234&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T01L", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
