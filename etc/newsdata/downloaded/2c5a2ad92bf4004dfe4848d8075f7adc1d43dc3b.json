Headwinds picked up overnight, which slowed us down to start with, but that was part of our scenario planning.\"\n\nThe Australian carrier described it as \u201cthe first non-stop commercial airline flight\u201d between the two cities, even though no paying passengers were aboard.\n\nAround half the 49 people on board were crew, while the rest were Qantas staff and observers.\n\nThe mission was part publicity stunt \u2013 emulating a nonstop Qantas flight from London to Sydney 30 years ago \u2013 and part research trip, to assess the effects of ultra-long flights on passengers.\n\nTests included monitoring the brain waves of pilots, measuring melatonin levels and checking alertness.\n\nPassengers were given exercise classes, and cabin lighting and in-flight meals were adjusted to try reduce jetlag.\n\nQantas said in a statement: \u201cData from these experiments will be used help shape the crew rostering and customer service of Qantas\u2019 ultra long haul flights in future.\u201d\n\nThe airline intends to launch nonstop flights from its Sydney base to both New York and London, using the term \u201cProject Sunrise.\u201d\n\nThe airline\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, was on board. He said: \u201cThe research we\u2019re doing should give us better strategies for improving comfort and wellbeing along the way. Night flights usually start with dinner and then lights off. For this flight, we started with lunch and kept the lights on for the first six hours, to match the time of day at our destination. It means you start reducing the jetlag straight away.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s already clear is how much time you can save. Our regular, one-stop New York to Sydney service (QF12) took off three hours before our direct flight but we arrived a few minutes ahead of it.\u201d\n\nThe normal Qantas link from New York involves a change of plane in Los Angeles.\n\nThe New York-Sydney flight has been widely misreported as the longest-ever commercial flight.\n\nThe nonstop flight between Heathrow and Sydney in 1989 using a Boeing 747 covered over 10,600 miles.\n\nIn 2018, Qantas launched nonstop flights between Heathrow and Perth in Western Australia. At 9,009 miles, it is the third-longest in the world, after the Singapore Airlines link from Singapore to New York (9,529 miles) and Doha-Auckland (Qatar Airways, 9,032 miles).\n\nThe latest Qantas flight defies growing criticism of ultra-long-haul aviation. Extreme flights are much more damaging for the environment, because they burn a large amount of fuel to carry fuel for later in the flight.\n\nTwo more research flights are planned as part of the Project Sunrise evaluations: London to Sydney in November and another New York to Sydney in December. The airline says: \u201cEmissions from all research flights will be fully offset.\u201d", "description": "A Qantas plane has flown more than 10,000 miles from the Atlantic coast of the US to the Pacific coast of Australia,\u00a0 The brand-new Boeing 787-9 flew nonstop from New York to Sydney in 19 hours 16 minutes.", "authors": ["Simon Calder"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/20/09/qantas787.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
