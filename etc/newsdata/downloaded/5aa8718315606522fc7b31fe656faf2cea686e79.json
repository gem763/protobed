Because Donald Trump would have gotten it wrong because he was lying, and then he would have given himself the medal.\u201d As Trump, he added, \u201cHe said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t pin that on me, sir. Pin it on yourself, because President Trump, you are the real hero.\u2019\u201d", "description": "The former vice president is scheduled to appear as a guest on \u2018The Late Show\u2019 this Wednesday night.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_30/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567570678/SC_11_dybj9p"}
