Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nA recurring theme of this newsletter is that, when it comes to big tech companies, Congressional hearings are often unsatisfying. Members fail to do their homework, and embarrass us with their picayune questions. Or they play to the cameras, interrupting witnesses before they can answer. For their part, tech executives take pains to make as little news as possible. They stick closely to their talking points, and when prodded off script they claim ignorance and promise that their staff will look into it later.\n\nToday\u2019s hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, at which Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed his company\u2019s plan to release a cryptocurrency, offered us all of those tropes. (Though it must be said that, unlike last year, this time members seem to have largely done their homework.) And the consensus view of the day\u2019s events \u2014 Congress very mad at Facebook \u2014 is something we knew before the hearing even began.\n\nThat said, they really do seem quite mad. Here\u2019s Tony Romm in the Washington Post:\n\nDuring the congressional grilling, Republican Rep. Ann Wagner (Missouri) challenged Facebook for failing to stop child exploitation online. Rep. William Lacy Clay (Missouri) lit into Zuckerberg for advertising policies that he claimed had resulted in discrimination against diverse communities on social media. And in one tense exchange, Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks (N.Y.) upbraided Zuckerberg for his company\u2019s role in serving as an \u201caccelerant in many of the destructive\u201d political fights around the world. \u201cFacebook has been systemically found at the scene of the crime,\u201d he began. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s just a coincidence?\u201d\n\nThere were lots of exchanges that, when clipped and posted on Twitter, earned many retweets. Like when Rep. Joyce Beatty pressed him on diversity efforts. Or Rep. Sean Casten\u2019s hypothetical question about a Nazi politician. Or Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s probing questions on the limits of political advertising on Facebook.\n\nAnd yet, while there were moments when the CEO found himself tongue-tied, for the most part Zuckerberg handled himself well. As the New York Times\u2019 Cecelia Kang put it:\n\n5Hrs later, Zuckerberg succeeded in what set out to do: Just Take The Heat. That means: do not buckle when interrupted, defend Facebook w/o appearing too defensive, don't promise anything & don't answer anything too controversial (Congresswoman, I'll get back to you) #Hearings101 \u2014 CeciliaKang (@ceciliakang) October 23, 2019\n\nWeirdly, the cumulative effect of all the embittered exchanges was to make the nominal question at the center of the hearing \u2014 whether Facebook should be permitted to develop and release a new currency \u2014 feel weirdly like a sideshow.\n\nAnd yet it\u2019s worth noting that it was on some of the Libra-related questions where Zuckerberg seemed to struggle the most. As Alex Heath wrote at The Information:\n\nThe roughly six-hour hearing saw Zuckerberg fumble questions from the House Financial Services Committee about how the external Libra Association will be funded, what kinds of regulations should apply to Libra, how Facebook plans to make money from Libra, and how policies like refunding fraudulent transactions will work. [...] What Zuckerberg did make clear is that Facebook won\u2019t launch Libra without proper regulatory approval in the U.S., and that Facebook would withdraw from the Libra Association if the group eventually decided to move forward on its own without the approval of U.S. regulators. But Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony didn\u2019t shed any light on what specific laws Facebook thinks should govern Libra.\n\nOn one hand, this hearing was always going to cast Zuckerberg in the role of a pi\u00f1ata. On the other, if today was supposed to advance Facebook\u2019s case that Libra is a good thing for the world, it\u2019s not clear to me that it succeeded.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say at this juncture whether Libra remains a viable project. In the past few weeks it has had what appear to be a significant series of significant setbacks, culminating with some of its most prominent early backers quitting.\n\nFor their part, Facebook and the Libra Association have said it\u2019s nothing to worry about \u2014 and in fact may be \u201cliberating.\u201d \u201cI would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,\u201d David Marcus said earlier this month, in a tweet that struck me as being at great risk of not aging well. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not great news in the short term, but in a way it\u2019s liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you\u2019re on to something when so much pressure builds up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that Facebook expected a lot of pressure here. Zuckerberg talked about it in the leaked audio that I published here earlier this month:\n\nThe public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic. But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often are more substantive and less dramatic. And those meetings aren\u2019t being played for the camera, but that\u2019s where a lot of the discussions and details get hashed out on things. So this is going to be a long road. We kind of expected this \u2014 that this is what big engagement looks like.\n\nThe question is whether Facebook is, indeed, getting a better reception in private than it is getting in public. So far, there is little evidence that it has. In the meantime, for all their dramatizing, the lawmakers who spoke today seemed sincere in their concerns about the havoc Libra might wreak havoc on the global financial system. And if they could have voted to end the Libra experiment today, it sure seems like a majority would have.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.\n\nTrending sideways: There was fodder for all sides to claim partial victory after today\u2019s big Libra hearing. But the project remains in an extended limbo.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50 Google employees accused company leaders of developing an internal surveillance tool to monitor their attempts to organize protests. The company said it was merely a pop-up reminder to stop employees from automatically adding tons of people to meetings. Ryan Gallagher at Bloomberg has more:\n\nEarlier this month, employees said they discovered that a team within the company was creating the new tool for the custom Google Chrome browser installed on all workers\u2019 computers and used to search internal systems. The concerns were outlined in a memo written by a Google employee and reviewed by Bloomberg News and by three Google employees who requested anonymity because they aren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. The tool would automatically report staffers who create a calendar event with more than 10 rooms or 100 participants, according to the employee memo. The most likely explanation, the memo alleged, \u201cis that this is an attempt of leadership to immediately learn about any workers organization attempts.\u201d\n\nThe top US prosecutor investigating Facebook and Google said breaking up big tech companies is \u201cperfectly on the table.\u201d He added that while big isn\u2019t necessarily bad, \u201cBig behaving badly is bad.\u201d Paging Dr. Seuss.

(Ryan Broderick / BuzzFeed)\n\nHere\u2019s how a new bill aimed at loosening big tech\u2019s control over user data would change the internet. Making services interoperable could have some benefits for competition between social networks, this sharp piece argues \u2014 but maybe fewer than you\u2019d think. (Adi Robertson / The Verge)\n\nFacebook has an unusual relationship with the Menlo Park Police Department, a Vice investigation reveals. The company is paying a special \u201cFacebook Unit\u201d $2 million a year to patrol the area around its campus. (Sarah Emerson / Vice)\n\nYouTube shut down the prominent white nationalist news channel Red Ice \u2014 but Facebook and Twitter didn\u2019t. The disjointed efforts highlights the need for big tech companies to coordinate, this piece argues. (Hannah Gais / Southern Poverty Law Center)\n\nChina\u2019s state-sponsored hackers are changing their tactics to focus more on iPhone and Android surveillance as well as disinformation campaigns on social media. They\u2019re primarily targeting Hong Kong protestors and ethnic minorities like Uighurs. (Nicole Perlroth, Kate Conger and Paul Mozur / The New York Times)\n\nHong Kong protesters are fighting to stay anonymous on heavily surveilled streets, and online. Police now treat every protest as an illegal assembly, and protestors face up to 10 years in jail if they\u2019re caught. (Trey Smith / The Verge)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 Google attained \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d with a breakthrough that could change computing. Their 53-bit quantum computer, called Sycamore, took 200 seconds to perform a calculation that otherwise would have taken the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years, says Gideon Lichfield in the MIT Technology Review:\n\nThe calculation has almost no practical use\u2014it spits out a string of random numbers. It was chosen just to show that Sycamore can indeed work the way a quantum computer should. Useful quantum machines are many years away, the technical hurdles are huge, and even then they\u2019ll probably beat classical computers only at certain tasks. But still, it\u2019s an important milestone\u2014one that Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s CEO, compares to the 12-second first flight by the Wright brothers.\n\nSheryl Sandberg said the idea that Facebook contributes to a \u201cfilter bubble\u201d is misunderstood. Apparently, 26 percent of news on people\u2019s feeds comes from opposing viewpoints, the Facebook COO said at an event Tuesday. (Kurt Wagner / Bloomberg)\n\nMeet the people who really do love Mark Zuckerberg. During his speech on free speech last week, fans peppered the livestream with adoring comments. Some people speculate that this is all fake, but there really are lots of Zuck stans out there, this piece reports. (Kaitlyn Tiffany / The Atlantic)\n\nYouTube\u2019s recommendation algorithm might not be responsible for radicalizing people, says according to a new report from Penn State. The proliferation of right-wing content signals a latent demand among creators and viewers rather than algorithmic influence, it argues. (Paris Martineau / Wired)\n\nCNN is considering launching a digital news service to compete with Facebook and Apple. The project, internally called NewsCo (not to be confused with Knewz!), will likely be a mix of subscription and ad-based content. (Jessica Toonkel / The Information)\n\nFacebook is still sorting out how to pay publishers featured on its upcoming news tab. The company is giving millions to publications like Bloomberg and Dow Jones, but nothing to Reuters or Associated Press.
