The SDF is responding.\"\n\nTurkey's aim in Syria\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the offensive, dubbed \"Operation Peace Spring\", would aim to eliminate threats from the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the Islamic State militants and enable the return of Syrian refugees in Turkey after the formation of a \"safe zone\" in the area.\n\n\"Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,\" Erdogan said on Twitter. \"We will preserve Syria's territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists.\"\n\nThe SDF is led by the YPG, a Kurdish militia group deemed a terrorist organisation by Turkey, due to their ties to militants waging an insurgency inside Turkey.\n\nMore: Why does Turkey want an offensive again Syria's Kurds and how is the US involved?\n\nCalls for UN Security Council meeting\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said Turkey must end its offensive, warning no European funding would be granted for a \"security zone\".\n\n\"Turkey must cease the ongoing military operation. It will not work. And if Turkey's plan is to create a security zone, do not expect funding from the European Union,\" he told the European Parliament in Brussels.\n\nThe EU rejected any Turkish plans for a safe zone for refugees, saying it would not provide aid there.\n\n\"The EU calls upon Turkey to cease the unilateral military action,\" it said in a joint statement of the 28 member states.\n\n\"It is unlikely that a so-called 'safe zone' in north-east Syria, as envisaged by Turkey, would satisfy international criteria for refugee return.\"\n\nFrance's European affairs minister said that France, Britain and Germany had called for the United Nations Security Council to meet to discuss the Turkish offensive.\n\nSpeaking to the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, French EU envoy Amelie de Montchalin said that the three countries were also finalising a joint statement to \"strongly condemn\" the Turkish offensive, but said a separate EU statement had yet to be agreed because some countries had not signed up to it.\n\nBritain's foreign secretary Dominic Raab said he had \"serious concerns\" about Turkey's offensive in northeast Syria.\n\n\"This risks destabilising the region, exacerbating humanitarian suffering, and undermining the progress made against Daesh (Islamic State) which should be our collective focus,\" Raab said in a statement.\n\nDutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said he had summoned the Turkish ambassador after Ankara launched a military incursion into Syria.\n\n\"The Netherlands condemns the Turkish offensive in northeast Syria,\" Blok said in a statement. \"We call on Turkey not to continue on the path they are going down.\"\n\nTurkey's military operation in northeastern Syria must be restrained, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday, adding that it was important not to destabilise the region any further.\n\nStoltenberg said that Turkey had \"legitimate security concerns\" and had informed NATO about its attack against Kurdish fighters in Syria.\n\n\"I count on Turkey to act with restraint and ensure that any action it may take in northern Syria is proportionate and measured,\" he said after meeting Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. \"It is important to avoid actions that may further destabilise the region, escalate tensions and cause more human suffering.\"\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet on Syria behind closed doors on Thursday, diplomats said.\n\nThe Turkish Foreign Minister, Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, said that Turkey sent a diplomatic note to the Syrian consulate in Istanbul to inform them of the operation in northern Syria, Reuters reported.\n\nCavusoglu said Turkey's operation was based on its rights related to international law and added that Ankara had informed all the necessary actors, including the United Nations and NATO.\n\nEgypt called for an emergency meeting of the League of Arab States over Turkey's offensive into Syria, the Egyptian foreign ministry said.\n\n\"Egypt condemned in the strongest terms the Turkish aggression on Syrian territory,\" the ministry said in a statement, adding that the offensive \"represents a blatant and unacceptable attack on the sovereignty of a brotherly Arab state.\"\n\nDonald Trump said in a statement released by the White House that the US \"does not endorse this attack\" adding it is a \"bad idea\".\n\nHow Donald Trump paved the way for Turkey's offensive\n\nTurkey had been poised to advance into northeast Syria since US troops began vacating the area in an abrupt policy shift by Donald Trump, widely criticised in Washington even by some of the President's Republican supporters.\n\nNikki Haley, former US ambassador to the United Nations, warned that his decision meant leaving US allies in the region \"to die\".\n\nFollowing the widespread criticism to withdraw troops, Trump took to Twitter to warn Erdogan he would \"obliterate\" Turkey's economy if it did anything he, \"in my great and unmatched wisdom\", considered to be \"off-limits\".\n\nMeanwhile, a leading Republican senator, usually a vocal ally of Trump, said he plans to introduce a package of \"devastating\" sanctions to hit Turkey over its military operation, expressing concerns over the fate of Kurds in the area.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham has repeatedly criticized Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from northeastern Syria.\n\nGraham told media outlet Axios in an interview published on Wednesday that the sanctions would strike the Turkish economy and military.\n\nWorld powers fear Turkey's invasion could open a new chapter in Syria's war and worsen regional turmoil.\n\nIn the build-up to the expected offensive, Syria had said it was determined to confront any Turkish aggression by all legitimate means.",
