Any protein would be lucky to be doused and marinated in it, but tofu soaks up the peanut sauce\u2019s flavors and chars up nicely upon roasting. The tofu\u2019s neutral flavor allows the other flavors in the dish to break through. Red miso and fish sauce provide umami, honey lends a subtle sweetness and the lime zest in the coconut rice brightens it all. Finished with pickled peppers and fresh sliced scallions, this dish comes together to make an exciting but quick weeknight dinner.", "description": "A spicy, fragrant peanut sauce reminiscent of the groundnut stews that are popular across West Africa anchors this recipe Any protein would be lucky to be doused and marinated in it, but tofu soaks up the peanut sauce\u2019s flavors and chars up nicely upon roasting The tofu\u2019s neutral flavor allows the other flavors in the dish to break through", "authors": ["Yewande Komolafe", "Amanda Hesser", "Martha Rose Shulman", "Mark Bittman", "Alison Roman", "Priya Krishna And Ritu Krishna", "Melissa Clark", "Robert Simonson"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/dining/yk-tofu-mafe/merlin_162370185_6b0e9f42-5885-4cd3-b8bb-9e3e0e0a9ef2-articleLarge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
