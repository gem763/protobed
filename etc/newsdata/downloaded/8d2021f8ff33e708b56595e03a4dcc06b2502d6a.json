(iStock)\n\nAn extreme case of \u201cfussy eating\u201d caused blindness in a United Kingdom teenager, according to a report published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nWhen Denize Atan, the study\u2019s lead author, met the 17-year-old boy at Bristol Eye Hospital, his eyesight had been deteriorating for two years. But what shocked her most was \u201chow long the patient\u2019s eating behaviour had persisted,\u201d Atan wrote in an email Tuesday to The Washington Post. \u201cBy the time I first met him, he had followed the same diet for [approximately seven] years.\u201d\n\nThe teen, who has not been named, told doctors that since elementary school, \u201che had a daily portion of fries from the local fish and chip shop and snacked on Pringles (Kellogg), white bread, processed ham slices, and sausage,\u201d the study said.\n\nThe risks of poor nutrition are often associated with obesity, poor cardiovascular health and cancer, but Atan\u2019s study warns that it can also have disastrous, and sometimes irreversible, effects on the nervous system, including vision.\n\nThe boy was first treated three years earlier by his family physician for \u201ctiredness.\u201d According to the report, the then-14 year old was a picky eater but was \u201cotherwise well and took no medications.\u201d Early testing showed he had low levels of vitamin B12 and macrocytic anemia, which were treated with B12 shots and \u201cdietary advice.\u201d\n\n[Lunchtime is so short in some public schools, students are going hungry]\n\nBy 15, the boy\u2019s hearing began failing, and then the vision complications arrived. Doctors could not determine what was causing either symptom.\n\nAfter two years of progressive vision loss, the boy was declared legally blind. Additional testing uncovered that his vitamin B12 deficiency had not waned. He had also developed a reduced bone mineral density level, and had high levels of zinc and low levels of copper, selenium and vitamin D.\n\nHis diagnosis, according to the report, was twofold: nutritional optic neuropathy and avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, an eating disorder that typically begins in middle childhood and is driven not by weight or shape concerns, but by an aversion to certain food textures and fearing the consequences of eating.\n\nNutritional optic neuropathy, which Atan said is more frequently caused by malabsorption, certain medications and alcoholism, is a dysfunction in the optic nerve. If caught early, it is reversible, but it can lead to permanent optic nerve damage and blindness if left untreated.\n\n\u201cNutritional deficiencies are actually quite common, but nutritional blindness is not,\u201d she told The Post. \u201cBlindness is an uncommon but serious complication of poor nutrition.\u201d\n\n[Five myths about fast food]\n\nIn a University of Bristol news release Monday, Atan, who is also a consultant senior lecturer in ophthalmology at Bristol Medical School and the clinical lead for neuro-ophthalmology at Bristol Eye Hospital, said: \u201cThis case highlights the impact of diet on visual and physical health, and the fact that calorie intake and BMI are not reliable indicators of nutritional status.\u201d\n\nNutritional optic neuropathy, researchers worry, may become more prevalent because of mass consumption of junk food and the \u201crising popularity of veganism\u201d that isn\u2019t regularly supplemented with B12.\n\n\u201cIt is important to eat a varied diet! There is not a single food that will provide all the vitamins and minerals you need \u2014 variety is the key,\u201d Atan said.\n\nShe hopes the teen\u2019s case will serve as a cautionary tale, leading to widespread inclusion of dietary history in routine clinical examinations.\n\nRead more\n\nHis daughter Annabel has a rare disorder.
