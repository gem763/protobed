Trump has defended a tweet from Sunday in which he warned Alabama despite predictions that, by then, had the storm turning north.\n\n\"The president's comments were based on that morning's Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama,\" Brown wrote.\n\nThroughout the day Trump insisted that \"certain models\" of forecasting once showed that the storm at one point could have hit Alabama, though the trajectory predicted by the National Hurricane Center had changed well before the president began talking about the threat to the state on Sunday.\n\nBrown's statement did not address the altered forecast map that the president held aloft on Wednesday in an effort to explain his warning to Alabama. Instead, Brown said that the president also reviewed \"spaghetti model\" maps that included a wider range of potential paths for the storm.\n\n\"What I said was accurate!\" Trump said during a string of Twitter messages posted throughout the day.\n\nMore: Trump doubles down on debunked Alabama comments, holds up map with added circle\n\nThe president appeared to be responding to commentators who mocked him for an incident Wednesday in which he displayed a hurricane forecasting map that had been altered \u2013 someone used a sharpie to scrawl a semi-circle to extend the storm's path into Alabama.\n\nDuring the day, Trump tweeted out old weather maps that also showed Alabama may have been vulnerable to the the fringes of the storm.\n\n\"Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit,\" Trump said. \"The Fake News denies it!\"\n\nTrump tweeted out maps developed on Aug. 29 and 30. He tweeted about the threat to Alabama on Sunday, Sept. 1, by which time maps showed that the storm had changed course.\n\nTrump's seeming obsession with Alabama and the hurricane drew derision on social media.\n\n\"Does @realDonaldTrump really not have anything better to do all day than rant on Twitter about whether Dorian was projected to hit Alabama?\" tweeted national security lawyer Bradley P. Moss, who represents USA TODAY in open records litigation.\n\nJoe Walsh, a former Republican congressman who is mounting a long-shot primary challenge to Trump, responded to Moss by saying: \"That\u2019s about it. He really doesn\u2019t have anything better to do.\"\n\nIn his morning tweet, Trump said: \"In the early days of the hurricane, when it was predicted that Dorian would go through Miami or West Palm Beach, even before it reached the Bahamas, certain models strongly suggested that Alabama & Georgia would be hit as it made its way through Florida & to the Gulf.\"\n\nIn a follow-up, he said: \"Instead it turned North and went up the coast, where it continues now. In the one model through Florida, the Great State of Alabama would have been hit or grazed. In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean!\"\n\nMore: Climate change comes off the backburner as White House hopefuls take on President Trump\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump insists he was right about Alabama and Hurricane Dorian", "description": "An adviser to Donald Trump said Thursday he briefed the president about the possibility of heavy winds in Alabama from Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": ["David Jackson", "John Fritze", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Bb6ebqGP.F7wSwZw4rm1Ng--~B/aD0xNzg1O3c9MjY3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/efc5e9b3b73294d62a550f477331fdef", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
