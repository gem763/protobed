Simply, it encourages bad behavior. Those who work hard don\u2019t get to keep the fruits of their labor beyond \u201cneeds.\u201d The system amounts to a 100% marginal tax rate if you earn more than a basic income. Suppose your basic needs are $50,000 a year. If you earn more than that, it is taxed away and put into a central fund, to help the needy.\n\nAnd for those who earn less than $50,000, their income is subsidized up to meet their \u201cneeds.\u201d In short, there\u2019s no incentive to work harder.\n\nNo wonder socialist utopias never last.\n\nAfter going through this exercise, I wrote on the blackboard an alternative statement, this one written by Jack London:\n\n\u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his deeds.\u201d\n\nJack London\u2019s statement is much better because it encourages industry, thrift and prudence in a society.\n\nWinston Churchill\u2019s clever statement above summarizes the difference between the two systems: Democratic socialism is all about sharing the poverty, while democratic capitalism is all about sharing the wealth.\n\nWhat Do I Mean by \u2018Sharing the Wealth\u2019 Under Capitalism?\n\nDemocratic capitalism is much better than socialism. By democratic capitalism, I mean companies that offer profit sharing and stock options. Henry Ford was the first to pass along some of his record profits in 1914 to his workers who manufactured Model T cars. He more than doubled their wages over night.\n\nIn more recent times, Bill Gates gave his workers stock options in Microsoft. Today more 12,000 employees are millionaires. Other companies have followed suit.\n\nSenator Rand Paul Writes a Book on Socialism\n\nLast week, my wife and I attended a book party for Senator Rand Paul. (See photo below.) He has written a full-length critique, \u201cThe Case Against Socialism.\u201d He has done a great job exposing the failure of socialism, demonstrating it\u2019s all about incentives. Interfering with the free market only makes matters worse.\n\n\n\nJo Ann and I visit with Senator Rand Paul in New York City.\n\nHe has two excellent chapters on Scandinavia, which Bernie Sanders points as an ideal socialist state. But Senator Paul demonstrates that \u201cSweden\u2019s riches actually came from capitalism,\u201d and Sweden has been moving away from socialism since a monetary crisis occurred in 1992. The Swedes cut taxes, privatized government programs, converted their social security system to a defined-contribution plan and introduced school choice. Sweden has been booming ever since.\n\nSenator Paul also has some good chapters on the benefits of capitalism. \u201cCapitalism is the more moral system\u2026it benefits the middle class\u2026and the poor are better off under capitalism.\u201d You can buy the book here: https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Socialism-Rand-Paul/dp/0062954865\n\nMarx vs. Mises: It\u2019s a Rap!\n\nThis week the revitalized American Institute for Economic Research (AIER) has released the clever rap song, \u201cThe March of History: Marx vs. Mises.\u201d It\u2019s similar to the highly popular \u201cKeynes vs. Hayek\u201d rap song that garnered nearly seven million views on YouTube. I\u2019m sure the Marx vs. Mises will do even better.\n\nIt\u2019s nine minutes long, but keeps your interest the entire time, and does a great job of presenting a fair and balanced view of both Marx/socialists and Mises/capitalists. Watch it here: https://misesvsmarx.aier.org/\n\nI agree with this strategy. The best way to teach students the benefits of democratic capitalism is to present both sides in a fair and balanced way. It\u2019s also a great way to introduce Ludwig von Mises, the great Austrian economist, professor and author, and make him equally famous to Karl Marx.\n\n\u2018The Book the Socialists Fear the Most\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s why my book, \u201cThe Making of Modern Economics: The Lives and Ideas of the Great Thinkers\u201d has been so successful. It has entire chapters on both sides of the socialist/capitalist debate.\n\nOn the capitalist side, it has chapters on Adam Smith, the French laissez-faire school of Say and Bastiat, the Austrians like Mises and Hayek and the Chicago school of Milton Friedman.\n\nOn the socialist side, it has chapters on Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen and the Institutionalists and John Maynard Keynes.\n\nI explain the pros and cons of both sides, and most students ultimately come away seeing the superiority of Adam Smith\u2019s \u201csystem of natural liberty,\u201d the heroic figure of my book.\n\nMy chapters, \u201cMarx Madness Plunges Economics into a New Dark Age,\u201d and \u201cThe Keynes Mutiny: Capitalism Faces its Greatest Challenge\u201d have been called \u201cthe most devastating critique of Marx and Keynes ever written.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Making of Modern Economics\u201d does not feel like a textbook \u2014 it has pictures, lots of stories and even music selections for all the great thinkers.\n\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, writes, \u201cSkousen\u2019s book is fun to read on every page. I have read it three times. I love this book and have recommended it to dozens of my friends.\u201d\n\nRoger Garrison, professor of economics at Auburn University, writes, \u201cMy students love it. Skousen makes the history of economics come alive like no other textbook.\u201d\n\nThe book is now in its 3rd edition and won the Choice Book Award for Outstanding Academic Excellence. The publisher Routledge charges $49 for the paperback, but you can get it directly from me for only $35 , and I pay the postage and will autograph each copy. For orders outside the United States, contact Harold below for additional charges.\n\nTo purchase a paperback copy of \u201cMaking of Modern Economics,\u201d go to www.skousenbooks.com , or call Harold at Ensign Publishing, 1-866-254-2057. The book is also available in hardback ($85), e-book or audio book (see Amazon).\n\nYou Blew it!\n\nThe Worst of Times or the Best of Times?\n\nDavid Leonhardt, a columnist for the New York Times, is at it again. In today\u2019s NYTimes Book Review of \u201cTransaction Man,\u201d he claims:\n\n\u201cThe four decades of the Transaction Man economy have not been good for most Americans. Wage growth has been slow, and life expectancy has stagnated. The public mood is sour\u2026.Today, we have powerful, self-interested corporations that benefit relatively few people.\u201d\n\nSay again?\n\nSelf-interested corporations have benefited few people? Say that to Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which have billions of customers around the globe!\n\nWage growth has stagnated? Actually, when you include benefits such as health care, paid and medical leave and retirement programs, total compensation continues to rise in the United States.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget all the new and improved consumer goods and services over the past 40 years \u2014 cars, television, computers, clothing, entertainment, you name it. Even the poor have these things in abundance. Americans have more leisure time than ever before. And air pollution in the United States is at an all-time low.\n\nLife expectancy has increased dramatically over the past 40 years. It has stagnated in the past four to five years, due to overdoses and suicides, but those who are avoiding these negatives are living longer.\n\nNot surprisingly, the stock market has increased 10 times over the past 40 years. And interest rates are at all-time lows.\n\nFor all the good news, see chapter 1 of my book \u201cThe Making of Modern Economics.\u201d\n\nDavid Leonhardt has his head in the sand.\n\nGood investing, AEIOU,\n\nMark Skousen\n\nP.S. I believe it should be every American\u2019s RIGHT to become independently wealthy (not to take from others, but by creating it on their own). What\u2019s more, there\u2019s an overlooked investment that I believe is the single greatest way Americans can build their wealth \u2014 one month at a time.
