As for VAR: disallowing goals for that nothing challenge would really destroy the game. Got to be for the howlers only. \u2014 Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) October 20, 2019\n\nUnited\u2019s goal came after a clear foul on Origi. Liverpool\u2019s disallowed goal came after a clearly accidental use of an arm by Mane.\n\nVAR doesn\u2019t just suck the life & passion out of football - it\u2019s almost invariably wrong too. Get rid of it. \u2014 Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 20, 2019\n\nMourinho: \"Ole & United after such fantastic effort will be disappointed with one mistake & two points that they lost. I asked for heart, they had more than that. They stuck to the game plan. If i were Ole, I'd be proud & frustrated because the boys gave everything.\u201d #mufc [Sky] \u2014 United Xtra (@utdxtra) October 20, 2019\n\nWorst Liverpool performance since Napoli (a) last season. Excruciatingly bad. Found mid-game suggestions relating to the team\u2019s mentality very odd considering the run they\u2019ve been on and what they\u2019ve won in that period. Idea obliterated by the timing and manner of the equaliser. \u2014 Simon Hughes (@Simon_Hughes__) October 20, 2019", "description": "Liverpool salvaged a late draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford as Adam Lallana's 85th minute goal canceled out Marcus Rashford's opener but the visitors' bid for a record run of victories came to an end.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5dac98c22030274d5d690031.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
