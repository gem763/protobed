As late as mid-December, another Trump lawyer, Ty Cobb, had brushed aside talk of stopped Mueller\u2019s investigation, stressing that there was \u201cno consideration at the White House of terminating the special counsel.\u201d The president himself has called the Mueller probe a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d but has not publicly urged Rosenstein to shutter it.\n\nWhen The Daily Beast initially asked Dowd if he was speaking on behalf of the president, he answered, \u201cYes as his counsel.\u201d After publication of this story, however, Dowd emailed to say he was actually speaking in his personal capacity, and not on the president\u2019s behalf.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nAs part of his initial email, Dowd included the text below, which is an annotated version of a line from a well-known 20th-century play:\n\nWhat\u2019s that smell in this room[Bureau}? Didn\u2019t you notice it, Brick [Jim]? Didn\u2019t you notice a powerful and obnoxious odor of mendacity in this room[Bureau}?... There ain\u2019t nothin\u2019 more powerful than the odor of mendacity[corruption]... You can smell it. It smells like death. Tennessee Williams- Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\n\nRosenstein, who is overseeing the probe because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from matters related to the 2016 campaign, has publicly defended and praised Mueller\u2019s work. Five days ago, he told USA Today, \u201cThe special counsel is not an unguided missile... I don\u2019t believe there is any justification at this point for terminating the special counsel.\u201d\n\nSessions announced on Friday night that he had fired McCabe, citing \u201clack of candor\u201d\u2014a fireable offense in the bureau. McCabe has long been a top target for Republicans, in part because his wife ran for office in Virginia as a Democrat and took campaign contributions from a close ally of Hillary Clinton. McCabe also featured in a controversial memo from Republicans on the House intelligence committee, which charged he improperly obtained authorization to surveil a former Trump campaign employee. McCabe has defended the way he obtained the warrant.\n\nUPDATE 11:09 a.m.: This story has been updated throughout, including with Dowd\u2019s new statement that he was speaking only in a personal capacity.", "description": "The president\u2019s personal attorney hopes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein follows \u2018the brilliant and courageous example\u2019 of Sessions, who just fired Andrew McCabe.", "authors": ["Betsy Woodruff", "Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1079,w_1919,x_1080,y_160/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1521294915/RTS183XG_g2yzco", "published_at": "2018-03-17"}
