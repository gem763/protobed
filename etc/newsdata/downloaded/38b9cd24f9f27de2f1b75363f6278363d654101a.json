Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died of been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. Going into the Middle East is the worst decision ever made in the history of our country. We went to war under a false and now disproven premise, weapons of mass destruction. There were none! Now we are slowly and carefully bringing our great soldiers and military home. Our focus is on the big picture! The USA is greater than ever before!\n\nThe United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 9, 2019\n\nTrump\u2019s new strategy sparked infighting between himself and prominent Republicans like Graham.\n\nGraham and other Republicans say Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is a dictator and will kill current American allies once our troops leave. Graham is particularly afraid the Kurdish fighters, an American ally who helped eliminate ISIS, will be endangered by American troops not remaining indefinitely on their behalf.\n\nTrump has attempted to deter Turkey from acting maliciously in the region by threatening to devastate the Turkish economy if they hurt American allies.\n\n\u201cI do agree on sanctions, but I actually think much tougher than sanctions. If [Erdogan] doesn\u2019t [enter Syria] in as humane way as possible,\u201d Trump said in the same press conference.\n\nTrump also made a promise to watch out for our Kurdish ally and continue to support them, but with more distance.\n\n\u201cAny unforced of unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially [and with] weapons,\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\n\u2026.understands that while we only had 50 soldiers remaining in that section of Syria, and they have been removed, any unforced or unnecessary fighting by Turkey will be devastating to their economy and to their very fragile currency. We are helping the Kurds financially/weapons! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nRegardless, many Republicans were vocal advocates that Trump keep U.S. troops in Syria. Examples include: Graham, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL). Media quickly elevated the Republican disagreement over foreign policy.\n\nNEWSFLASH:\n\nErdogan and humane do not belong in the same sentence. Worst is yet to come.https://t.co/0QZ0kKp0lT \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) October 10, 2019\n\nAt request of this administration the Kurds served as the primary ground fighters against ISIS in Syria so U.S. troops wouldn\u2019t have to. Then cut deal with Erdogan allowing him to wipe them out. Damage to our reputation & national interest will be extraordinary & long lasting. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) October 9, 2019", "description": "During a press conference, President Trump called out Sen.
