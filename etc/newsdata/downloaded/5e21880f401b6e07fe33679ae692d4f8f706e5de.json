Also included are the Infiniti Q50, Q60, QX30 and QX80 vehicles.\n\nFrom the 2019 model year, the Nissan GT-R and Taxi and Infiniti QX50, QX60, Q70, Q70L also are included.\n\nThe recalled vehicles also went to Israel, Korea and Saipan, the company says.\n\nNissan says in government documents posted Tuesday that owners can adjust the camera displays so the image isn't visible. The displays will keep that setting the next time the vehicles are shifted into reverse. That violates federal safety standards. Documents say the lack of a backup camera image increases the risk of a crash.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe company says it has no reports of crashes or injuries.\n\nDealers will update the backup camera software settings at no cost to owners starting Oct. 21. The company says the repair will take less than a half hour.", "description": "Don't adjust your screens.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/titan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
