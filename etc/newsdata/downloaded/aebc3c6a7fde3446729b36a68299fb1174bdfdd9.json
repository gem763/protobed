In the first, the Intelligence Committee, led by Mr. Schiff \u2014 which until now has been conducting closed-door depositions about the Ukraine scandal \u2014 would hold one or more open hearings to take public testimony about the matter. His committee would then compile its findings in a repor t, and transmit transcripts and additional evidence to the Judiciary Committee .\n\nIn the second phase, the Judiciary Committee, led by Mr. Nadler, would receive the Intelligence Committee report and consider whether to recommend one or more articles of impeachment. The Judiciary panel could also seek additional evidence, including hearing from witnesses. Mr. Trump\u2019s legal team would be permitted to participate in that round.\n\nStill, a related set of procedures unveiled on Tuesday by the Judiciary Committee for its phase sought to use that due process right as leverage to get Mr. Trump to stop stonewalling congressional subpoenas. Mr. Trump has vowed to fight all subpoenas, and his White House counsel has directed executive branch employees not to participate in the effort.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee procedures would empower Mr. Nadler to block Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers from cross-examining witnesses if the president continued to try to prevent any of the four committees conducting impeachment-related investigations from gathering information from the executive branch. (Republicans on the committee could still do so.)\n\n\u201cShould the president unlawfully refuse to make witnesses available\u201d or produce documents, the procedures said, Mr. Nadler could \u201cimpose appropriate remedies, including by denying specific requests by the president or his counsel under these procedures to call or question witnesses.\u201d", "description": "The resolution, which is scheduled for a House vote on Thursday, would require the production of a public report and allow for due process rights for President Trump.", "authors": ["Nicholas Fandos", "Charlie Savage"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/us/politics/29dc-impeach/29dc-impeach-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
