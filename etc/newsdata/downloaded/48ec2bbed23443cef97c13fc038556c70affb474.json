M\u0101ori pin their hopes on PM in fight for sacred site Read more\n\nThe government has been unusually circumspect on the issue of Ihum\u0101tao, and prime minister Jacinda Ardern has repeatedly refused to visit the site, despite strident calls by protesters for her to consult them and pay her respects.\n\nArdern said the government would defer to the position of the M\u0101ori king, who visited the site in August and has consulted widely with disparate M\u0101ori groups who have overlapping claims to the land.\n\nActing prime minister Winston Peters thanked the king for his consultation efforts, and said the government was now happy to engage with all parties until a resolution was reached.\n\n\u201cWe have always said that we are happy to join the discussions on the future of the land at Ihum\u0101tao,\u201d Peters said in a statement. \u201cAs we go through the process we are mindful of heritage claims, precedent issues and the commercial interests in the site.\u201d\n\nPania Newton, the co-leader of Soul (Save Our Unique Landscape), who has been occupying Ihum\u0101tao for close to three years, welcomed the king\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe only way we are ever to achieve justice is if the Crown puts right the wrong made in 1863 when they stole the land,\u201d Newton posted on Facebook. \u201cAnd the wrong in 2016 when the Crown facilitated the sale and purchase of this rare cultural heritage landscape to Fletcher Building Limited.\u201d", "description": "Kiingi T\u016bheitia Potatau Te Wherowhero VII says land at heart of housing dispute should be given back to indigenous custodians", "authors": ["Eleanor Ainge Roy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c556911677e291fb7d8e1d298d4be4a525ba148/0_215_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3f154bffba0231b4ad741f0d12f4eff1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
