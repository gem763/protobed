Or, in this instance, the little puppy. In a heartfelt plea posted to Mark Hamill\u2019s Twitter account late Wednesday night Brussels time, Driver announced that he was out in the park searching for very good boy Javelot the dog. (That\u2019s pronounced with a French J and silent t, like if Javert and Tove Lo had a celebrity-couple name.) The video features Driver, in his best kid-detective hoodie, standing next to a missing-dog poster with a picture of the sweet pup, informing viewers that this is the beloved dog of Holy Motors director Leo Carax, as well as the third-generation descendant in a long line of Carax dogs.\n\n#AdamDriver is asking for help to find #Javelot- #LeosCarax\u2019s dog! He is 9-yrs old & has been missing for over 24 hrs. We want to make sure he is warm-has shelter & fed-Watch video for more info-Let me know if you\u2019ve seen him or can help by phone or text Try Max at +32472342341 pic.twitter.com/lqi6DPOnBf \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) October 2, 2019\n\nDriver describes what happened in detail:\n\n\u201cWe were shooting a scene in a club, as you do, and we were outside, and he god spooked by some of the traffic and ran off, so he\u2019s been missing for 24 hours. The last place he was seen was in this park where we all are. There\u2019s a crew of people behind us, looking for Javelot.\u201d\n\nPauvre petit chien! Clearly it was Take Your Pup to Work Day on the set of Carax\u2019s upcoming Adam Driver\u2013Marion Cotillard musical Annette, and the excitement of an ADAM DRIVER MUSICAL was too much for the terrier. And if the straight-to-DVD Disney sequels Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp\u2019s Adventure and 101 Dalmatians II: Patch\u2019s London Adventure have taught me anything, it\u2019s that it\u2019s scary out there for a little dog lost in the big city.\n\nIn the tweet and the video, Hamill and Driver share the phone number for crew member Max, which concerned citizens can call if they find Javelot. We did some sleuthing of our own and found a listing for Javelot on the Belgique page of www.chien-perdu.org. It describes Javelot as a little fox terrier who\u2019s skittish but very nice. While concerned citizens should expect the satisfaction of a good deed done and a firm embrace from Adam Driver rewards unto themselves, here are the rewards that Driver is offering to whoever brings back Javelot:\n\nWe will put you in the movie\n\nWe\u2019ll give you chocolate\n\nWe\u2019ll christen your child\n\nThat\u2019s the Adam Driver guarantee! Also, sidebar, how cute is it that Mark Hamill posted this for Adam? He\u2019s the Watson to Driver\u2019s Holmes! The Javelot to his Carax!
