Subscribe via Pocket Cast or iTunes.\n\nPresident Donald Trump blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues at the central bank for hurting manufacturing companies after a key gauge of the industry\u2019s health posted its weakest reading since the end of the last recession.\n\n\u201cAs I predicted, Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong, especially relative to ALL other currencies, that our manufacturers are being negatively affected,\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThe outburst followed the release of the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s factory index, which slipped to its lowest level since June 2009. The measure of export orders, a proxy for overseas demand, fell to 41, the lowest level since March 2009, while the imports index remained in contraction.\n\nAmerican manufacturing has stalled amid uncertainty caused by slowing global growth, escalating disputes between the U.S. and its major trading partners, and a strengthening U.S. dollar that makes exports more expensive. Economists have said the trade war was the biggest factor.\n\n\u201cSimmering trade tension is the obvious culprit for the manufacturing weakness,\u201d Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, wrote in a note to clients.\n\nChris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, wrote that \u201cmanufacturing executives are scared to death that the trade war is going to crush their exports to recession levels and force them to turn the factory lights out.\u201d\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the world\u2019s largest economy will expand by 2.3% in 2019, carried by strong consumer demand. Gross domestic product expanded 2.5% on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis last year.\n\nTo guard against the risk of a sharper slowdown, and to boost below-target inflation, the Fed has cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point twice this year. Policy makers haven\u2019t signaled strongly whether they intend to lower rates again before the year is out.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Christopher Condon in Washington at ccondon4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Margaret Collins at mcollins45@bloomberg.net, Jeff Kearns, Matthew Boesler\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
