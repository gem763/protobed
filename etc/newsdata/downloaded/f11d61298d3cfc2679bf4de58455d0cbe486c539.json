ICER rejected almost all of them.\n\nMany of the drug company studies were observational and funded by the companies, and ICER made it clear from the outset that it would only consider observational studies \"that were high quality and comparative.\"\n\nWhat we're watching: The FDA wants to use more simple trials and observational data in drug evaluations, similar to what drug companies submitted to ICER.\n\nBut as Joseph Ross, a professor of medicine at Yale, wrote several years ago, it\u2019s important to assess \"the methodological rigor of observational studies before interpreting real-world effects.\"\n\nOur thought bubble, via Bob: ICER's report is transparent, telling readers that none of the funding for its report came from any part of the industry and outlining clearly what it considered to be acceptable research.\n\nPharmaceutical companies, meanwhile, have every financial incentive to try to dress up the data around those drugs.\n\nGo deeper: Concerns rise about generic drugs from over", "description": "An international watchdog and pharmaceutical companies can't agree.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/Rt0fwvxC3iwku0ENgxj9OzZynpc=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/09/1570617116723.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
