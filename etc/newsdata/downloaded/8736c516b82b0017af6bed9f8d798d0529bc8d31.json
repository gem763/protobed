Eisai was also responsible for bringing the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism to Japan; his integration of the zen spirit with the preparation of tea laid the groundwork for the traditional Japanese tea ceremony.\n\nToday, tea remains an important part of everyday life for Japanese people, often sipped in the morning or on an afternoon break, served to guests, or used to give a boost when feeling unwell. There\u2019s a strong belief in tea\u2019s curative properties and its ability to bring good health.", "description": "Matcha is booming across the globe, but only a select group will ever get to taste Japan\u2019s purest, ceremonial-grade form of the tea, grown in Uji, near Kyoto, for centuries.", "authors": ["Clara Hogan", "Hiromi Tanoue"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/7n/sd/p07nsdq7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
