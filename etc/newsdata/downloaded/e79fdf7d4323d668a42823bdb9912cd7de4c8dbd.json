According to a letter sent to a UK Parliament committee, Netflix tracks ratings with those three metrics with directors and producers, and based on previous reports, may use that breakdown to determine if a show is worth renewing. The letter adds that Netflix believes \u201cthese two metrics will give our creative partners a broader understanding of how members engage with their title from start to finish.\u201d The letter is part of an ongoing examination of video-on-demand (VOD) and subscription-video-on-demand (SVOD) services on public television in the UK.\n\nStarters are \u201chouseholds that watch two minutes of a film or one episode\u201d in a series. Completers are \u201chouseholds that watch 90 percent of a film or season of a series.\u201d These are the two main data points that Netflix gives to its producers and directors, according to the letter. This data accounts for the first seven days of a release, followed by the first 28. The third data set is watchers, a more general metric that Netflix often includes in its quarterly earnings letters to shareholders and shares with the public. Households that watch 70 percent of a movie or one episode in a series are considered \u201cwatchers.\u201d\n\n\u201cDepending on how useful our partners find this data, we will consider sharing it in more countries outside Europe and North America,\u201d the letter reads.\n\nCompleters are \u201chouseholds that watch 90 percent of a film or season of a series\u201d\n\nThe third data point is one most people will be familiar with as Netflix often uses it to tout record-breaking series. Most recently, Netflix announced that Stranger Things\u2019 third season became \u201cthe most watched season to date,\u201d with \u201c64 million member households\u201d watching it within the first month of its release. This data is based on people who are classified as watchers. A footnote in Netflix\u2019s fourth quarter earnings letter to shareholders in 2018 explained that, \u201cdue to their highly variable length, we count a viewer if they substantially complete at least one episode (70 percent).\u201d\n\nThese viewership numbers are extremely important to creators, akin to traditional Nielsen ratings in broadcast and network television. Netflix doesn\u2019t work directly with Nielsen to track traditional ratings, and reportedly uses an efficiency metric to determine if a show is worth renewing. Essentially, it\u2019s a ratio that determines the cost of a show to the viewership, and whether the series is instrumental in retaining subscribers at risk of canceling their memberships or bringing in new subscribers. A show like Stranger Things does both, while shows with smaller, dedicated fan bases like The OA often get canceled.\n\nSome writers and producers have expressed frustration with the lack of transparency over numbers. Tuca and Bertie creator Lisa Hanawalt criticized Netflix\u2019s algorithm when her show got canceled, prompting other showrunners to speak out about their own concerns over how Netflix executives value a show and its audience.\n\nNetflix executives like CEO Reed Hastings and chief content officer Ted Sarandos have addressed criticism that they\u2019re not transparent enough, and promised earlier this year to do better.\n\n\u201cI would look at it like these are less financial metrics as they are cultural metrics,\u201d Sarandos said during a previous earnings call in January. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for artists to understand, to have the audience also understand the size of the reach of their work. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll see us ramping up a little bit more and more and giving out \u2014 sharing a little more of that information.\u201d", "description": "Netflix is trying to be more transparent with its creatives about how it counts a view on an original series or movie, and a letter sent to the British government includes three new descriptors: starters, watchers, and completers.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xvrHweAZgMXWr1KwBGP9j01dlpg=/0x51:2040x1119/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9570401/wv_publicity_pre_launch_A_still_crop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
