Everyone knows this is a corrupt place ... Plus, I'm not sure that the other European countries are helping them out either.\u201d\n\nMulvaney added: \u201cDid [Trump] also mention to me, in the past, the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it. And that\u2019s why we held up the money ... The look back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that he was worried about in corruption with that nation. And that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: RECORD SUPPORT FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT\n\nMulvaney was then questioned by a reporter about his explanation, saying that it sounded like a quid pro quo.\n\nHe responded: \"We do that all the time. Get over it. Politics is going to be involved in foreign policy. Elections do have consequences.\"\n\nHe pointed to the example of the administration holding up aid to Central American countries to force them to change their policies on immigration. The White House ultimately agreed to release the aid to Ukraine last month.\n\nMulvaney also said that one of the stipulations for Ukraine receiving aid was that Kiev cooperates with Connecticut U.S. Attorney John Durham\u2019s investigation into the origins of the 2016 Russia investigation. But a senior Justice Department official told Fox News that the department had no idea what Mulvaney was talking about.\n\n\"If the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation with any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\" the official said.\n\nHUNTER BIDEN BREAKS SILENCE ON UKRAINE BUSINESS DEALS, CLAIMS HE DID 'NOTHING WRONG AT ALL'\n\nWhile most of Trump\u2019s critics have seized on him imploring the Ukrainian leader to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, over their business dealings in the eastern European nation, Mulvaney\u2019s comments are likely to turn the attention of Trump's critics onto an entirely different matter.\n\nTrump has claimed multiple times in the past, without evidence, that a server with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails on it was being held by a company based in Ukraine.\n\nHouse Democrats, who have been investigating whether the president engaged in a political quid pro quo when he asked the new Ukraine president to do a \"favor,\" immediately called it an admission of guilt.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the Intelligence Committee leading the impeachment probe, told reporters: \"I think Mr. Mulvaney's acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse.\"\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., who sits on both the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, tweeted: \u201cMick Mulvaney has co-signed [Donald Trump\u2019s] confession to the crime.\u201d\n\nIt is illegal to solicit or receive anything of value from a foreign entity in U.S. elections.\n\nFox News\u2019 Jake Gibson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney\u00a0seemed to contradict President Trump\u2019s claim\u00a0that there was no \u201cquid pro quo\u201d during his\u00a0July 25 phone call \u00a0with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/ContentBroker_contentid-30e9e0e77c074b7e9cfac35b8bc9d6af.png", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
