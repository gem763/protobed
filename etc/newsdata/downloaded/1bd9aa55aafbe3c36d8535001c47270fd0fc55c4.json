The nation expects from both of us to act responsibly and to cooperate. So I am calling on you Benny, let\u2019s meet today, at any hour, at any time in order to move this process forward.\u201d\n\nHe added: \"We cannot and there is no reason to go to third elections. I am against this.\"\n\nNETANYAHU CANCELS UN TRIP, FORGOES MEETING WITH TRUMP AFTER FAILING TO SECURE AN OUTRIGHT VICTORY IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS\n\nLater on Thursday, Gantz reportedly dismissed Netanyahu\u2019s offer of a unity government that includes all the religious right-wing parties and insisted that he should lead the next coalition. Gantz also stressed his commitment to liberal policies on religious issues, according to The Times of Israel.\n\nGantz reportedly said at a political faction meeting on Thursday, \u201cThe nation went to the ballots and made a clear choice \u2014 the nation chose unity. Blue and White won the elections, Blue and White is the biggest party. I intend to form a broad unity government headed by me, which would reflect the people\u2019s choice and our basic promises to the public and our priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t succumb to any imposition. To form a unity government, one doesn\u2019t come with political blocs and spin but with seriousness and responsibility,\u201d Gantz reportedly added.\n\nISRAELI EXIT POLLS SHOW NETANYAHU SHORT OF MAJORITY IN YEAR'S SECOND ELECTION\n\nNeither party will be able to form a majority without support from Avigdor Lieberman, of the nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party. His insistence on a secular government would force out Netanyahu's traditional allies, the country's two ultra-Orthodox parties, and another nationalist-religious party.\n\nThe Blue and White party has repeatedly ruled out sitting in a government under Netanyahu, who, in the coming months, may face indictment in a slew of corruption scandals that include allegations of bribery, breach of trust and fraud. His political opponents warned that if Netanyahu is named prime minister again, he will use the position to secure himself immunity from prosecution, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nAfter Gantz rejected Netanyahu\u2019s offer of a unity government with the religious right, the prime minister said he was \u201csurprised and disappointed,\u201d according to the newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe president called for unity, and without a meeting between the leaders of the two biggest parties a unity government cannot be formed,\u201d Netanyahu reportedly in a statement, adding that his offer to meet with Gantz stands.\n\nIsrael\u2019s president Reuven Rivlin, who has until Oct. 2 to task a lawmaker with forming a government, will begin consultations with the newly-elected Knesset [Israeli Parliament] groups on Sunday, his office reportedly announced Thursday.\n\nRivlin\u2019s choice will have up to six weeks to assemble a government and if that person fails, the president can appoint another candidate, who will get up to four weeks.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News\u2019 Stephen Sorace and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's\u00a0direct rival, Benny Gantz,\u00a0rejected the leader\u2019s appeal to form a unity government on Thursday as the country\u2019s two main political parties remained deadlocked at the end of an unprecedented second election, with the prospect of a third looming.", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
