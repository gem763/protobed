All I smell is fish,\" she said. \"I can't enjoy my backyard, I can't go out there.\"\n\nMs Carden\u2019s lawsuit began two years ago and she alleged that the smell of the barbecue and cigarettes were affecting her quality of life in her home in the Perth suburb of Girrawheen.\n\nHer list of demands included asking another neighbour to reduce their patio lighting, silence their pets and to replace plants in the common garden.\n\nThe tribunal deemed her complaints unreasonable and lacking in evidence.\n\nIt said: \u201cWhat they [Carden\u2019s neighbours] are doing is living in their backyard and their home as a family.\u201d\n\nParents allowing their children to play in the backyard did not constitute a reasonable nuisance, according to the tribunal.\n\nFearful of reprisals from Miss Carden, her neighbours had not turned on the lights, used the patio and allowed the children out at night for several months, the tribunal heard.\n\nMs Carden's 400-page appeal was rejected in July.\n\nSupreme Court chief justice Peter Quinlan said that after considering the expansive material he judged that: \u201cMs Carden was given a fair opportunity to present her case, and the learned tribunal member conducted the proceedings fairly and appropriately.\u201d\n\nMs Carden has told Australian media that she plans on taking further action.\n\nLegal Aid Victoria warned that legal intervention in the neighbourhood could be expensive and lengthy, suggesting dispute resolution.\n\nSupreme Court chief justice Quinlan recommended that the neighbours \u201cdirect their considerable energies towards the resolution of their differences as best they can.\u201d", "description": "A vegan in Western Australia who took her neighbours to the supreme court in a failed bid to stop them from using their barbecue has said she is considering further legal action.", "authors": ["Isabella Ruffatti"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k1nCjOI3jSBIxf6jrGO97g--~B/aD0xMTg3O3c9MTg5NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/28416e70104ce955a202eda5474a6266"}
