The searches included thousands of emails and phone numbers, and included the contractor's search of his family, other agents and himself.\n\nThe court made the startling revelation that in one day alone in December 2017, the Bureau made 6,800 queries of the databases using Social Security numbers, Daily Beast reports.\n\nThere were 'fundamental misunderstandings' among some FBI personnel over the standards necessary for the searches, the government conceded secretly.\n\nJudge James Boasberg of the FISA court, the Journal reports, wrote that the case demonstrated how a 'single improper decision or assessment' resulted in a search of data belonging to a large number of individuals.\n\nHe said the government had reported since April 2017 'a large number of FBI queries that were not reasonably likely to return foreign-intelligence information or evidence of a crime,' the standard required for such searches.\n\n'The FBI's querying procedures and minimization procedures,' according to Boasberg, 'are not consistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment'.", "description": "A secret court has ruled that the FBI tapped into an internet surveillance database for checking up on foreign agents to do illegal research on Americans, in a violation of their privacy rights.", "authors": ["Ralph R.
