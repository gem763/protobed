(Beat in this case being a bit too literal at times.) When an elderly couple used a walker to cross the street in order to attend a conservative event at Mohawk College in Ontario, Canada, the masked goons of Antifa immediately responded to the threat. Intimidating octogenarians by impeding their access and shouting \u201cNAZI SCUM OFF OUR STREETS\u201d in their faces is totes honorable, right?\n\nAntifa protesters scream at & block elderly couple outside an event featuring conservative politician @MaximeBernier & @RubinReport. Further violence broke out, leading to two arrests. Mohawk College had faced massive campaign to cancel the event. pic.twitter.com/D49dTcMi4X \u2014 Andy Ngo (@MrAndyNgo) September 30, 2019\n\nHow brave! I especially liked the \u201cDON\u2019T F*****G TOUCH ME!\u201d from the courageous sidewalk blockers screamed into the face of an old man who just wanted to get to the other side of the street. After all, this elderly couple clearly represented such an acute and imminent threat to the safety of the community that it required the assembly of [checks notes] goons in masks who don\u2019t have the gastric fortitude to show their faces in public.\n\nAnyway, while every Antifa action is a clown-show-cum-domestic-terrorism exercise to some extent, this one deserves special attention. When you\u2019re so enraptured in your own status as a social-justice warrior martyr that you can\u2019t strategize about the optics of your actions, this is what you get \u2014 an elderly couple getting terrorized on camera by progressives in the street. Great job, everyone!\n\nAnyway, Ngo has a little longer video showing more of the lowlights from this Antifa protest. Had it not been for the octogenarian harassment that Ngo caught on camera, this might have been a more typical Antifa event \u2014 full of threats and intimidation, followed by massive claims of victimhood when the least of consequences followed. Four people were arrested, but none charged, apparently.", "description": "Optics fail.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/antifa-ontario.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
