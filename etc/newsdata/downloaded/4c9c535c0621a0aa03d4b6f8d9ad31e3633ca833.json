But just how much time and money L.A. residents spend commuting may still come as an nasty shock.\n\nAngelenos waste 119 hours a year stuck in gridlock, making it the U.S. city with the worst traffic in the latest Texas A&M Transportation Institute\u2019s 2019 Urban Mobility Report. That\u2019s just under five days, or an entire workweek, spent trying to get to and from the office. Worse, that time idling on the road is burning through an extra 35 gallons of fuel.\n\nThat\u2019s almost double the national average, with urban commuters spending an extra 54 hours a year on congested roads, or 2.5 days (an entire weekend) trapped in their cars. What\u2019s more, Americans are using an extra 21 gallons of fuel during these bumper-to-bumper slogs.\n\nRelated: More than 1 in 5 workers have quit their jobs over a bad commute, but this new tool could fix that.\n\nThe report calculates these delays as costing around $1,010 per commuter, drawing on the median hourly wage from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But there\u2019s also the incalculable cost of uncertain or longer delivery times; missed meetings; business relocations; and other congestion-related effects. On a national scale, the TTI report says that gridlock cost the country $166 billion in 2017, a more than tenfold increase over the previous 15 years.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t just a big city problem. The report reveals that almost all regions now have worse congestion than before the 2008 economic recession, concluding that today\u2019s record low unemployment rate means that more people are driving to and from their jobs on the same roads. \u201cThis has been the case in the past \u2014 the economy-congestion linkage is as dependable as gravity,\u201d reads the report.\n\nOf course, as ride-hailing services such as Uber UBER, -5.15%, Lyft LYFT, -7.57% and Juno have become a key mode of transportation \u2014 with Uber rides surging past yellow cabs in NYC, for example \u2014 that have put more cars on the road, too. While these businesses have claimed to help ease congestion in cities, a recent San Francisco study found that locals spent 62% more time sitting in traffic in 2016 than they did in 2010, before ride-sharing went mainstream.\n\nNew York City is mulling how to implement the nation\u2019s first congestion pricing system, charging cars a fee to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan \u2014 which would raise money for its overburdened mass transit system as well as discourage some drivers for adding to the congestion. And heavy-traffic cities on this list such as LA and San Francisco are doing their own congestion pricing studies to see if this could be a way to reduce gridlock.\n\nHere are the five cities with the worst traffic:\n\nLos Angeles: Commuters spend 119 extra hours (4.95 days) each year sitting in traffic, using 35 gallons of fuel.\n\nSan Francisco: Commuters spend 103 extra hours (4.3 days) sitting in traffic, using 45 gallons of fuel.\n\nWashington, D.C.: Commuters spend 102 extra hours (4.3 days) sitting in traffic, using 38 gallons of fuel.\n\nNew York City: Commuters spend 92 extra hours (3.8 days) sitting in traffic, using 38 gallons of fuel.\n\nBoston: Commuters spend 80 extra hours (3.3 days) sitting in traffic, using 31 gallons of fuel.", "description": "A new report finds that traffic delays are worse than ever across the U.S.", "authors": ["Nicole Lyn Pesce"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP981_ltraff_ZG_20190822123843.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-22"}
