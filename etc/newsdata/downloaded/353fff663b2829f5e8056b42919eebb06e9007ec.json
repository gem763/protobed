After the meeting, the U.S. said it would suspend a tariff increase on Chinese goods that were supposed to take effect on Tuesday this week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said China agreed to a \"very substantial phase one deal\" that will be written over the next three weeks. Trump also said the deal would address intellectual property and financial services concerns, as well as Chinese purchases of about $40 billion to $50 billion U.S. agricultural products.\n\nOn Thursday, Gao did not confirm the exact amount but maintained that Chinese companies would increase their purchases of U.S. agricultural products, according to Chinese market needs and market-based principles.\n\nGao also did not confirm when a phase one agreement would be signed or whether the leaders of both countries planned to meet. He did note, however, that teams from both sides remain in communication.\n\n\"We hope both sides can continue to work together to advance the negotiations and, as soon as possible, reach a phased agreement and make new progress on canceling tariffs,\" Gao said.", "description": "Beijing hopes both countries will \"reach a phased agreement and make new progress on canceling tariffs,\" China's Ministry of Commerce spokesman said Thursday.", "authors": ["Evelyn Cheng"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106141584-1569008787669gettyimages-1158663945.jpeg?v=1571302979", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
