I am at a loss for words for all the support I have received from all over the world,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThank you to all who gave me the opportunity. Asante.\u201d\n\nPATRICK SANG, KIPCHOGE\u2019S COACH\n\n\u201cHe has inspired all of us that we can stretch our limits in our lives. You have made history.\n\n\u201cEverything went perfectly right. For the sport, it challenges other young athletes. For humanity, whatever level you are in you can move yourself to another level.\u201d\n\nTEAM INEOS PRINCIPAL DAVE BRAILSFORD\n\n\u201cEliud is a once-in-a-generation athlete and if anybody deserves to break the two-hour barrier it is him. It was an incredible performance and a privilege to be here.\n\n\u201cIt was a great lesson in a very evenly-paced run. He was very calm and conservative and the pacemakers took Eliud to the last kilometre for him to bring it home.\u201d\n\nTEAM INEOS OWNER JIM RATCLIFFE\n\n\u201cThat last kilometre where he actually accelerated and came through on his own was just superhuman. I can\u2019t believe he did it.\u201d\n\nKENYA\u2019S FIVE-TIME OLYMPIAN BERNARD LAGAT\n\n\u201cEliud told the world that if you set your mind to something nothing is impossible.\u201d\n\nAMERICAN SHALANE FLANAGAN, 2017 NEW YORK CITY MARATHON CHAMPION\n\n\u201cEliud Kipchoge raced against the clock and raced towards history today. He did it! I never thought I would see this in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nRAILA ODINGA, FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF KENYA\n\n\u201cThis is the stuff of history @EliudKipchoge. You captured the imagination of the whole world before this great feat and it will continue for a long time.\u201d\n\nAUSTRALIAN ROBERT DE CASTELLA, FORMER WORLD CHAMPION MARATHONER\n\n\u201cJust astounded! A moment in history! What a run! What a man! His message after is gold. \u2018Running is hard but it is beautiful, I want everyone to run... together we can make the world a beautiful place.\u2019 Amazing.\u201d\n\nBRITAIN\u2019S FIVE-TIMES OLYMPIAN JO PAVEY\n\n\u201cWow!! 1:59:40!! @EliudKipchoge has made history and pushed the limits of human endeavour. So awesome to watch.
