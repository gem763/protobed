The following catalogue isn\u2019t intended as a contribution to theory. It is the evidence behind my personal observation that, for as long as I have studied the Middle East, all of the profoundly formative events have been \u201cblack swans,\u201d imagined or predicted by almost no one. For an expert, that\u2019s humbling (or should be).\n\nBut, first, what is a black swan? For centuries, it was assumed in Europe that all swans were white. The phrase \u201cblack swan\u201d was used as we would use \u201cflying pig\u201d: a metaphor for something that couldn\u2019t exist. But then a 17th-century Dutch explorer observed a black swan in Australia. That single sighting demolished an assumption that had stood since time immemorial.\n\nThe concept of a black-swan event was popularized a few years ago in a bestselling book with that title. Its flamboyant author, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, argued that the most dramatic changes in politics, economics, and technology come out of the blue. A black-swan event, ran his definition, \u201clies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility\u201d (my emphases).\n\nSo a black-swan event is more extreme than a low-probability event. A black-swan event has no prior indication that it\u2019s even possible. It\u2019s unthinkable. And yet, Taleb concluded, while black swans themselves are rare, we live in a world largely fashioned by such once-unthinkable events. This wasn\u2019t an entirely original argument, but his showmanship turned \u201cblack swan\u201d into a common figure of speech.\n\nOf course, what constitutes a black-swan event is a matter of perspective. Your assumptions may be upended by a surprise attack, but it\u2019s no surprise to the attacker. For example, the June 1967 Six-Day War, preemptively initiated by Israel, was a black-swan event for Egypt, but obviously not for Israel.\n\nIn what follows, the perspective I assume is American. My seven black-swan events not only took Washington by surprise, but had far-reaching impacts on U.S. interests and policies. Also, while it\u2019s tempting to go way back in time for more examples, I\u2019ll limit myself to events within living memory, which (depending on your age) you probably remember, too.\n\nBefore we plunge in, it\u2019s also important to remember this: inevitably, many a black-swan event has been preceded by evidence suggesting the possibility of a black-swan event. In fact, some observers, seeing the evidence, may even have a premonition of the event itself. Such \u201c[p]rescient memos are a dime a dozen in Washington after a crisis,\u201d wrote the late Christopher Hitchens. \u201cThey are often then read for the first time, or leaked to the press or Congress.\u201d\n\nBut the evidence and the memos aren\u2019t sufficiently convincing, because they don\u2019t come together in a story that\u2019s more persuasive than the prevalent one. Here, too, it\u2019s a matter of perspective. A black-swan event is a black-swan event not because no one has imagined it, but because it was unimaginable to the people who mattered.\n\nWho mattered? The ones who could have prevented it in the first place.\n\n1. 1973: \u201cSimply, obviously, and starkly wrong\u201d\n\nARABS AND ISRAELIS BATTLE ON TWO FRONTS;\n\nEGYPTIANS BRIDGE SUEZ; AIR DUELS INTENSIFY\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, October 7, 1973\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only Israel that was taken by surprise in 1973 when Egypt and Syria attacked Israel across the Suez Canal and the Golan Heights. So were U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nOn October 6, the very day of the surprise attack, the CIA estimated that \u201cfor Egypt, a military initiative makes little sense at this critical juncture,\u201d while \u201cfor the Syrian president [Hafez al-Assad], a military adventure now would be suicidal.\u201d An internal memo from the National Security Council noted that while the Israelis had become persuaded that an attack might be in the works, \u201cour intelligence services have continued to downplay the likelihood of an Arab attack on Israel and still have no signs that such action is imminent.\u201d\n\nA CIA post-mortem from December 1973 admitted that the agency\u2019s estimates \u201cwere\u2014quite simply, obviously, and starkly\u2014wrong.\u201d It wasn\u2019t for a lack of information. \u201cSuch information (derived from both human and technical sources) was not conclusive but was plentiful, ominous, and often accurate.\u201d But all of these raw data were filtered through preconceptions about Arab intentions and capabilities.\n\nAs with every black-swan event, it all seemed so obvious afterward. But as the post-mortem notes, \u201cwhat may seem so clear now did not, could not, seem so clear then.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just Israel\u2019s problem: by 1973, the Israeli-Arab conflict had become embedded in the cold war, and when Israel finally did gain the upper hand on the battlefield, the Soviets threatened direct intervention. U.S. nuclear forces went to Defcon 3. The Soviets backed down: as Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin put it, \u201cit is not reasonable to become engaged in a war with the U.S. because of Egypt and Syria.\u201d\n\nBut the other effects of the war remade the Middle East.\n\n2. \u201cIran is not in a revolutionary situation\u201d\n\nSHAH LEAVES IRAN FOR INDEFINITE STAY;\n\nCROWDS EXULT, MANY EXPECT LONG EXILE\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, January 17, 1979\n\nIn his recent memoir of the Carter years, Stuart Eizenstat writes: \u201cOne could fill an ocean with what the United States did not know about developments in Iran.\u201d\n\nWhen President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977, the State Department reassured him that the shah of Iran, \u201cin fine health, and protected by an elaborate security apparatus, has an excellent chance to rule for a dozen or more years.\u201d In August 1978, as popular discontent built, the CIA still concluded that \u201cIran is not in a revolutionary or even a pre-revolutionary situation. There is dissatisfaction with the shah, but this does not at present threaten the government.\u201d Even when, three months later, the U.S. ambassador in Tehran finally wrote a memo entitled \u201cThinking the Unthinkable,\u201d few were willing to think it.\n\nIn hindsight, all the evidence was there. (It always is.) Israel\u2019s ambassador to Iran, Uri Lubrani, as early as June 1978, had reported that the erosion in the shah\u2019s position was \u201caccelerated and irreversible,\u201d and that it would\n\nculminate in his fall and a drastic change in Iran\u2019s form of government. It\u2019s very hard to estimate the time frame. My very personal estimate, which isn\u2019t based on any objective data, it that the range is more or less five years.\n\nEven this perceptive take overestimated the shah\u2019s shelf life. He fled the country only eight months later.\n\nBecause Washington assumed the shah\u2019s omniscience and omnipotence, it misread all of the signs. Ayatollah Khomeini gave birth to the Islamic Republic, the American embassy was taken hostage for over a year, and today, 40 years later, the United States is still locked in struggle with Iran.\n\nAnd the Middle East? Nothing has done more than Iran\u2019s revolution to transform it.\n\nSign Up For Our E-Mail List Get the latest from Mosaic right in your inbox Daily Weekly\n\n3. Soviet invasion: \u201cConsidered highly unlikely\u201d\n\nAFGHAN PRESIDENT IS OUSTED\n\nAND EXECUTED IN KABUL COUP,\n\nREPORTEDLY WITH SOVIET HELP\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, December 28, 1979\n\nWhen Soviet troops poured into Afghanistan in December 1979, Washington was dazed. The Soviet Union was the number-one target of U.S. intelligence collection and analysis. Intelligence might be off on Egypt or Syria, but the United States spared no means to surveil the USSR, with its vast nuclear arsenal and its huge military divisions in Europe.\n\nIn fact, there was plenty of raw intelligence\u2014how could there not be? But no one thought the Soviets would be so stupid as to invade. The CIA\u2019s post-mortem admitted that a Soviet invasion \u201cwas considered highly unlikely\u201d because the political and military costs would be \u201ctoo high.\u201d Even when evidence accumulated of an impending move, \u201cthe idea that the Soviets would actually pay the price of invading seemed so outrageous that it was estimated that only a small force would be committed.\u201d The warning signs never coalesced into a clear warning\u2014hence the shock in Washington when the Soviets sent in three full divisions, upward of 30,000 troops.\n\nAn after-the-fact internal investigation rushed to reassure policymakers that if the Russians tried to pull the same fast one in Europe, U.S. intelligence authorities would know it well in advance. It\u2019s just that Afghanistan was . . . well, a bit off the U.S. radar. The invasion led swiftly to the so-called \u201cCarter Doctrine,\u201d declaring the Persian Gulf an American lake. It was followed by a ten-year proxy war waged by the CIA against the Soviets in Afghanistan, with consequences that last until today.\n\n4. Kuwait: \u201cSaddam would not be so foolish\u201d\n\nINVADING IRAQIS SEIZE KUWAIT AND ITS OIL;\n\nU.S. CONDEMNS ATTACK, URGES UNITED ACTION\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, August 3, 1990\n\nWas the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the summer of 1990 a total surprise? Through the first half of 1990, an office in the CIA did issue warnings, especially as the United States detected the movement of Iraqi forces. The CIA officer who issued the warnings would later write:\n\nIndicators were assessed early and accurately. Our prior assessment of timelines for war preparations proved correct. Policy officials were informed of our conclusions at each major stage in the development of the threat, personally as well as in writing. Nevertheless, the warning messages\u2014both warning of war and warning of attack\u2014were not heeded, either by senior intelligence officials or by policymakers.\n\nWhy not? To them, it was unthinkable. Iraq\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, would never dare. He might do a limited grab of Kuwaiti territory, some surmised. But as April Glaspie, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, later admitted, \u201cI didn\u2019t think, and nobody else did, that the Iraqis were going to take all of Kuwait.\u201d Edward Gnehm, the prospective U.S. ambassador to Kuwait at the time, would recall that\n\nno one in a position of responsibility to my knowledge seems to have considered the possibility that Saddam was going to overrun all of Kuwait. There wasn\u2019t even a consensus that Saddam intended to invade at all. Even though the CIA had changed their assessment, there were others who still said an invasion was ridiculous.\n\nMuch fog was spread by friendly Arab leaders, foremost among them Egypt\u2019s President Hosni Mubarak. According to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, these leaders claimed that \u201cSaddam was bluffing\u201d and \u201curged us not to take any steps that would provoke\u201d him. The Soviets also issued reassurances. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, nothing is going to happen,\u201d Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, assured his American opposite, James Baker. \u201cSaddam would not be so foolish.\u201d And since, Baker recalled, Iraq was a client state of the Soviets, \u201csurely the Arabists back in Moscow would know what was going on.\u201d\n\nSince the CIA warnings were already ambiguous, the views of Arabs and Russians tilted the assessment made by U.S. leaders. Iraq then invaded Kuwait, ushering in the era of American boots on the ground in the Middle East.\n\n5. 9/11: \u201cFailure of imagination\u201d\n\nU.S. ATTACKED\n\nHIJACKED JETS DESTROY TWIN TOWERS\n\nAND HIT PENTAGON IN DAY OF TERROR\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, September 12, 2001\n\n\u201cThe 9/11 attacks were a shock,\u201d the 9/11 Commission later found, \u201cbut they should not have come as a surprise. Islamist extremists had given plenty of warning that they meant to kill Americans indiscriminately and in large numbers.\u201d Four months before the attacks, for instance, Louis Freeh, the FBI director, said that al-Qaeda was bent on \u201cthe planning and carrying out of large-scale, high-profile, high-casualty terrorist attacks against U.S. interests and citizens and those of our allies, worldwide.\u201d\n\nBut the world is a wide place, and conventional wisdom held that al-Qaeda would most likely strike in the Middle East or Africa. Even a dozen intelligence reports on al-Qaeda\u2019s possible use of hijacked planes as weapons didn\u2019t dent that assumption. Neither did a daily intelligence brief given to President George W. Bush a month before the attacks, headlined: \u201cBin-Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe 9/11 Commission found multiple sources of dysfunction in the way the bureaucracy handled intelligence, but the greatest weakness was what it called a \u201cfailure of imagination.\u201d As a result, the commission concluded,\n\nthe domestic agencies never mobilized in response to the threat. They did not have direction, and they did not have a plan to institute. The borders were not hardened. Transportation systems were not fortified. Electronic surveillance was not targeted against a domestic threat. State and local law enforcement were not marshaled to augment the FBI\u2019s efforts. The public was not warned.\n\nAll this has changed since 9/11, but not before the attacks utterly transfigured America\u2019s role in the Middle East.\n\n6. \u201cOh, my goodness, Hamas won?\u201d\n\nHAMAS ROUTS RULING FACTION,\n\nCASTING PALL ON PEACE PROCESS\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, January 27, 2006\n\nIt was President George W. Bush, convinced of America\u2019s democratizing mission, who pushed for elections in the West Bank and Gaza in January 2006. And it seemed to make good sense. Palestinian polls showed that the faction led by Mahmoud Abbas would defeat Hamas handily. An electoral victory, it was thought, would solidify his rule, enabling him to strike a peace deal with Israel.\n\nAs the votes were counted, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was doing her early-morning workout in the fitness center of her apartment complex. Looking up, she saw these words crawl across the television screen: \u201cIn wake of Hamas victory, Palestinian cabinet resigns.\u201d Astonished, she called her office.\n\nI said, \u201cWhat happened in the Palestinian elections?\u201d And they said, \u201cOh, Hamas won.\u201d And I thought, \u201cOh, my goodness, Hamas won?\u201d I thought, might as well finish exercising. It\u2019s going to be a really long day.\n\nHamas didn\u2019t just win; it won in a landslide. \u201cNobody saw it coming,\u201d Rice told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who wasn\u2019t caught off-guard by Hamas\u2019s strong showing.\u201d\n\nAs I demonstrated at the time, misleading polls played a major role. But even these were filtered through the template of democracy-promotion, with its settled tendency to believe that moderation must triumph.\n\nIn relaying the bad news, the New York Times reported these words by Ephraim Halevy, a former head of Mossad: \u201cThe era of the pretend peace process is over.\u201d The splitting of Palestinian legitimacy, soon to be made tangible by Hamas\u2019s physical seizure of Gaza, destroyed not only the meager prospects for an agreement but the very process itself.\n\n7. Arab Spring: \u201cWe were lax\u201d\n\nMUBARAK OUT\n\nEGYPT EXULTS AS YOUTH REVOLT ENDS 3 DECADES OF IRON GRIP\n\n\u2014New York Times, front-page headline, February 12, 2011\n\nRight up until the \u201cArab Spring\u201d of 2011, Arab regimes seemed immovable. Then, all of a sudden, mass protests toppled dictators in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen. In the last two, and in Syria, instability would deteriorate into civil war.\n\nMichael Morell, the then-deputy director of the CIA, admitted the agency\u2019s failure:\n\nWe failed because to a large extent we were relying on a handful of strong leaders to help us understand what was going on in the Arab street. We were lax in creating our own windows into what was happening, and the leadership we were relying on was unaware of the tidal wave that was about to hit them.\n\nThis \u201coutsourcing\u201d of assessments to allies and friends is the origin of many a surprise. Surely, the reasoning goes, the Israelis will know before we do whether they face an attack? Surely the shah will know before we do whether he\u2019s in danger? Surely our Arab friends will know before we do whether Saddam is going off the rails? If our friends are complacent, why should we be alarmed?\n\nAmerica\u2019s allies in the Middle East do provide the U.S. with vital intelligence and insights. But their blind spots also become Washington\u2019s.\n\nToday there is a whole industry trying to explain the Arab Spring\u2014in hindsight. This is supposed to establish a set of warning signs for when it might happen next. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the man who popularized the \u201cblack swan\u201d concept, dismisses such efforts:\n\nThe final episode of the upheaval in Egypt was unpredictable for all observers, especially those involved. As such, blaming the CIA is as foolish as funding it to forecast such events. Governments are wasting billions of dollars on attempting to predict events that are produced by complex systems and are therefore not statistically understandable at the individual level.\n\nThe catalogue I\u2019ve just provided could have been expanded, but these seven instances make the point: the most far-reaching changes in the Middle East caught American experts by surprise.\n\nIt\u2019s customary to describe these instances as \u201cintelligence failures.\u201d The information was there; lacking was the imagination. But it is naive to think that such events can be predicted at all. There are always warning signs, of course, but they won\u2019t be sufficiently convincing to overturn long-held assumptions grounded in past experience. If that is the case, then no matter how much intelligence is collected, surprise will follow surprise.\n\nYou might think that the best experts, at least, would have an advantage when it comes to predicting outlier events. But looking back, I can\u2019t think of anyone who\u2019s actually done it. Some, however, have detected trends. One who did so was the late Bernard Lewis, who in 1976 published a maverick essay in Commentary entitled \u201cThe Return of Islam.\u201d It was brilliant, and Lewis wrote it two years before the Iranian revolution. But he didn\u2019t mention Iran, instead focusing on the Arabs.\n\nAbout the Iranian revolution, Lewis would later say: \u201cI must confess I\u2019d never heard of Khomeini. Who had?\u201d Even if you had been persuaded by his 1976 article, you would still have been surprised by the revolution in Iran.\n\nSo detecting trends isn\u2019t the same as predicting events, especially black-swan events. And even if you could, who would believe you? You\u2019d be labeled a fantasist. And if you turned out to be wrong, you\u2019d be ridiculed; Washington is no more forgiving than Wall Street. There is much to be said for the maxim widely misattributed to John Maynard Keynes: \u201cIt\u2019s better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.\u201d That\u2019s why the wisest Washington oracles keep their forecasts vague.\n\nIf predicting the unpredictable is mission impossible, what should experts do? The answer: plenty. When black-swan events do occur, as they must, policy is thrown into disarray, the reputations of rash forecasters crumble, and a scramble ensues. This is precisely when a well-timed intervention can make a difference. Expertise and imagination are an advantage, not in predicting black swans but in responding to them. Each black swan is an opportunity, to be either seized or wasted.\n\nHenry Kissinger was the master here. Although totally surprised by the outbreak of war on Yom Kippur in 1973, he understood that it created an opening for the United States. His wartime maneuvers and his subsequent \u201cshuttle diplomacy\u201d put Egypt in America\u2019s camp and laid the cornerstone of its peace with Israel.\n\nRonald Reagan was also adept at seizing the opportunity. After his election, he turned the surprise Soviet move into Afghanistan into a covert CIA war that bled the Soviets dry, and ten years later helped to bring down the Soviet Union.\n\nBy contrast, the Bush II team wasted their black swan by leveraging the disarray that followed 9/11 in an effort to spread democracy, beginning in Iraq. That ended up weakening the pax Americana.\n\nThe mission, then, is clear. Since surprises will happen, it is crucial to be the first to forge a new paradigm out of the wreckage while Washington is grasping for ideas. In that sense, most of what experts do is in patient preparation for the day when assumptions come tumbling down.\n\nAnd when will the next opportunity arise? I wish I knew, but if I told you, you wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway. Yet of one thing I\u2019m certain. The next black swan is quietly and directly gliding our way.\n\nSign Up For Our E-Mail List Get the latest from Mosaic right in your inbox Daily Weekly", "description": "", "authors": ["Martin Kramer", "Mosaic"], "top_image": "https://mosaicmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Tahrir-Square-Main.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
