The driver called the animal hospital when he realised what had happened.\n\nThe koala had \u201cpretty bad gravel rash\u201d but her injuries could have been much worse.\n\n\u201cI suspect she pulled her hind legs up and that\u2019s what reduced her injuries,\u201d Flanagan told Guardian Australia on Thursday. \u201cShe would have been dragged for 10km ... She would have had no feet left.\u201d\n\nDespite the gravel rash, fear and adrenaline would have spurred Wazza to rush up the tree, Flanagan said.\n\nWazza, who is estimated to be three years old, has been recovering since the accident a week and a half ago.\n\nWhen she arrived at hospital she was given a general anaesthetic so staff could tend to her injuries.\n\n\u201cShe was pretty freaked out,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cMost wild animals don\u2019t like it when you touch them at the best of times.\u201d\n\nThe week in wildlife \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nWazza was \u201cdoing fabulously\u201d and could be released within three weeks.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s outside in the rehabilitation yards, climbing trees \u2013 only small ones,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long when she\u2019s healed properly.\u201d\n\nAlthough the hospital deals with drag injuries from time to time, Wazza was the first to enter its care after a 110km/h ordeal: \u201cShe takes the cake.\u201d", "description": "Young female frees herself when car stops after 10km and is taken to hospital with minor injuries", "authors": ["Luke Henriques-Gomes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/514ace1ff2a29ba095b0be1726ac0861dfa225fc/0_225_895_537/master/895.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=89bd9c3061b21f2cdf0bd17b3e574c20", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
