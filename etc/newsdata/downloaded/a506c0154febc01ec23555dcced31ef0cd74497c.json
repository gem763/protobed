Let's talk about what you are planning to write.\"\n\nThe most surprising thing about the failure of the government to get its planned facial recognition database up last week is that there hadn't been broader debate and outcry about the potential Orwellian nightmare it could precipitate.\n\nThe planning for this legislation had been in train since 2017, when a rushed Council of Australian Governments meeting voted to hand over all their driver licence photos to be used in a National Facial Biometric Matching Capability database.\n\nThe idea behind the scheme was that it could be used to reduce identity fraud and also in conjunction with CCTV cameras in train stations, airports and other public spaces to spot potential terrorists in real time.\n\nHowever the scope of the planned laws was frightening to anyone who has ever even glanced at a copy of George Orwell's 1984, or had considered the fact that the current style of national governance can shift at any time towards authoritarianism.\n\nThe Parliament's joint intelligence committee sent the legislation back to the drawing board based on concerns raised by multiple submissions to the review that there were far few controls being enshrined into law to govern who could access such powerful personal data.\n\nWhile the Bill was to be administered by Peter Dutton's Home Affairs Department, the surveillance technology data would have been made available to investigate potential crimes committed under the Customs Act, the Crimes Act, the Criminal Code and even the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\n\nIn other words, there was a huge risk of scope creep that could lead to citizens living an a country where their behaviour is not only monitored in real time, but can be retrospectively searched by myriad people in positions of authority, keen to find out if you have stepped out of line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile there are obvious benefits to authorities having access to facial recognition data, such as in the hunt for missing people and criminals on the loose, there are huge downsides for both the conduct of our personal and professional lives.\n\nLooking for a new job and fancy catching up with a competitor for a sneaky coffee? Making a big deal that could move markets, and planning to meet? Good luck dodging the cameras.\n\nLike all laws that deal with technology, legislators need to adopt extreme caution about the future capabilities of the systems in use.\n\nWhile facial recognition software is not sophisticated enough yet to perform the kind of nightmare scenario, of tracking every public moment of its citizens accurately, it sure as hell will be in the future.\n\nTrials using facial recognition in CCTV cameras at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games were largely unsuccessful in identifying individuals thought to be in the crowds, but no technology company sits on its hands \u2013 the tech will get there in the end.\n\nHeed Hong Kong warning\n\nThat should be a concern to anyone who enjoys living their life in the current Australia, because artificially intelligent surveillance will change that.\n\nWhile some people may question the tendancies of some existing politicians towards authoritarianism, it is fair to say that we have long had the luxury of living in a society where we needn't fear for our safety for criticising the government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that may not always be the case in future.\n\nProtesters in Hong Kong were recently photographed tearing down cameras in the street, fearful that they were being tagged for a future night time knock on the door from Chinese authorities. Australian citizens would be foolish to believe that our own government will automatically be benign forever.\n\nCritics of these kinds of laws are always met with the argument that \"if you aren't doing anything wrong you have nothing to fear\", but that goes against any notion people on either wing of politics should believe about government interference in lives.\n\nThere is a huge difference between \"doing the wrong thing\" and doing something illegal, and having an all-seeing eye hovering over our every secret meeting or transgression would change our existence significantly.\n\nWhen the Bill returns, citizens and politicians should think very carefully before voting away the ability to do things that we'd all rather forget forever.", "description": "The government was thwarted in its plans to use a powerful database of facial recognition data, and we should all consider it a reprieve from a big stride into 1984.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2233%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0df0f3788e7957942b9e85f68a53ac0d191a90be", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
