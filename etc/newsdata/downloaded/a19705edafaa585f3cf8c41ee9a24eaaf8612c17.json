She will face either 2017 French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko or Russian eighth seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in Sunday\u2019s final.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy,\u201d Gauff added after winning in 92 minutes. \u201cI thought I was out in qualifying and now I\u2019m here.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the highest-level matches I\u2019ve played. Andrea hit a lot of winners and put pressure on me.\n\n\u201cI was fighting for every point, even at break points down, I just tried to get the serve in and make her play a point.\u201d\n\nThis is Gauff\u2019s first WTA tournament since she left the court in tears after a heavy defeat by two-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka in the US Open third round.\n\nGauff showed plenty of variety in her game as she beat the 75th-ranked Petkovic, relying frequently on well-executed drop shots.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the most confident with it but it worked well today,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll keep using it until it doesn\u2019t work so well anymore.\u201d\n\nThe youngest-ever winner of a WTA Tour title was two-time US Open champion Tracy Austin, aged just 14, at Portland in 1977.\n\nGauff saved nine of 10 break points and broke her opponent for 3-2 in the second set as Petkovic saved five break points before double-faulting on a sixth.\n\nThe American fought through in the final game to serve out victory, staving off three break points and coming through on her second match point.\n\nHer mother arrived in time to watch her daughter, flying in from Luxembourg after arriving from Florida.\n\nGauff had thought she would be involved in Luxembourg WTA qualifying this weekend, but finds herself with more pressing duties in Linz instead.", "description": "Coco Gauff reached the first WTA final of her career on Saturday as the 15-year-old beat Andrea Petkovic 6-4, 6-4 in the last four in Linz", "authors": ["Agence France-Presse"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b161cc975009a40afec5bd45ffe3d8ad9c3a2c/0_0_5077_3046/master/5077.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ad3fc17b54ac042481dcea74343eb623", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
