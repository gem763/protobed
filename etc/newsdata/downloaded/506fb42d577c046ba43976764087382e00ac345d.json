This week it's Guy, 40, and Ross, 27", "language": "en", "text": "Guy, 40, (pictured) who is a sales executive at Audi, has been single for around 14 months\n\nGUY, 40\n\nDATING PAST\n\nFrom 1998 to 1999, I was a Roman Catholic monk (these days I\u2019m not overly religious). I have had one long-term relationship, which lasted 15 years, and a couple of shorter ones both before and after.\n\nI\u2019ve been single for around 14 months, and I\u2019ve done all the online dating stuff \u2014 it\u2019s great for meeting people, but not necessarily for longevity, which is what I want.\n\nPRE-DATE NERVES?\n\nI\u2019d never been on a blind date, so it was exciting. It\u2019s a bit strange knowing you\u2019re meeting someone who you know nothing about.\n\nLOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?\n\nWe arrived at the same time and I was pleasantly surprised: Ross is good-looking with a lovely smile. We\u2019d both gone for a similar style of dress, which was a good sign. It made me feel we were on the same wavelength.\n\nVITAL STATISTICS Single. CURRENT ROLE Sales executive at Audi. WOULD LIKE TO MEET I tend to go for younger men. I love cars, museums and art, so someone with whom I can share my interests would be great, and I\u2019m up for a serious relationship.\n\nEASY TO TALK TO?\n\nRoss is chatty and friendly, so we discussed everything from what we want to do in life, to travelling and a little about past dating, although we stayed quite safe on that front and kept it brief. We had some deep conversations as well as light-hearted banter. We have the same sense of humour, so I feel we got each other.\n\nEMBARRASSING MOMENTS?\n\nNo \u2014 we were at Restaurant Ours in London, which was beautiful, so we were on our best behaviour, despite having more than a few drinks!\n\nDID SPARKS FLY?\n\nYes, there was a little bit of flirting, with lots of eye contact and smiling. We stayed for three hours and I knew I was missing my last normal train home, but I was happy to miss it. In the end, I got the late train and didn\u2019t get home until after 2am.\n\nWe messaged on the way home \u2013 I think this has potential!\n\nWe got on so well we swapped phone numbers, and it was nice to keep the conversation going on the train home as we messaged each other. I definitely think this has potential.\n\nDID YOU KISS?\n\nWe didn\u2019t kiss, but that was largely circumstance as we got the same Tube and he got off first. Possibly under less time pressure, we would have.\n\nGUY\u2019S VERDICT: 8/10 LIKED? His lovely smile. REGRETS? That I was on a tight schedule for a train. COFFEE OR CAB? Coffee.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK HE THOUGHT OF YOU?\n\nI found Ross quite hard to read, but I do feel there is some chemistry. I\u2019d like to meet up in a more relaxed manner and see how things go.\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE HIM HOME TO YOUR FAMILY ?\n\nYes, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to introduce him to them. He\u2019s a great guy.\n\nRoss, 27, (pictured) who is an events manager and student, has been single for three-and-a-half years\n\nROSS, 27\n\nDATING PAST\n\nI\u2019ve been single for three-and-a-half years and before that I\u2019d had only two relationships, each of which were a year long. My last relationship broke up because I moved to Turkey in 2016. I came back in January.\n\nPRE-DATE NERVES?\n\nI don\u2019t really get nervous.\n\nLOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?\n\nVITAL STATISTICS Single. CURRENT ROLE Events manager and anthropology masters student. WOULD LIKE TO MEET Someone clever \u2014 I\u2019m a bit of a nerd and hope to do my PhD. I go for dark hair and eyes.\n\nHe was lovely but, sadly, there was no attraction in that sense, as he couldn\u2019t be further from my romantic type. He\u2019s a lovely guy, but I knew instantly he wasn\u2019t for me \u2014 I normally go for the Mediterranean look.\n\nEASY TO TALK TO?\n\nYES, and there was no awkwardness. We chatted about everything \u2014 we talked quite a lot about travel and living abroad, because I\u2019ve just returned from Turkey and he spent a lot of his upbringing in Abu Dhabi. We laughed a lot and just got on well. You can tell he doesn\u2019t have a problem making friends.\n\nEMBARRASSING MOMENTS?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. I had to apologise for my bad language, because I swear a lot, but he wasn\u2019t offended!\n\nDID SPARKS FLY?\n\nFor me, no. He was a lovely guy and we swapped phone numbers because I enjoyed his company. We spent a long time on the date and even stayed for espresso martinis, but there was no romance for me.\n\nHe\u2019s a nice guy, but I prefer the Mediterranean look\n\nDID YOU KISS?\n\nNo. I would never lead anyone on if I didn\u2019t think that there was potential.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK HE THOUGHT OF YOU?\n\nROSS\u2019S VERDICT: 7/10 LIKED? He was so easy to talk to. REGRETS? None. COFFEE OR CAB? Coffee.\n\nI assumed he liked me because he asked for my number, and I was happy to give it to him because I liked him, too \u2014 but I\u2019d have to tell him only as a friend.\n\nWOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE HIM HOME TO YOUR FAMILY?\n\nNo, but only because he\u2019s not my type to date.", "description": "Every week, FEMAIL sends two singletons on a blind date.
