More like an event in a marquee. A tent in the fucking sand it was. Keep spoofing to your self horse. Jock strap sniffer championships.\u201d\n\nWho\u2019s not the man? Your man had that marquee event did he? More like an event in a marquee. A tent in the fucking sand it was. Keep spoofing to your self horse. Jock strap sniffer championships. \u2014 Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) October 19, 2019\n\nMcGregor\u2019s social media response comes not long after the New York Times published a report saying the former two-division UFC champion is being investigated in his native Ireland for a second alleged sexual assault.\n\nMcGregor has not fought since a little more than a year ago, when Nurmagomedov submitted him in the fourth round at UFC 229. After his win, Nurmagomedov jumped over the cage and went after McGregor teammate Dillon Danis cageside, which set off a melee that wound up with both fighters suspended and fined by the Nevada Athletic Commission.\n\nMcGregor won the featherweight title in December 2015, but never defended it. Instead, he went after the lightweight belt and won it in November 2016. He never defended that title, either. He opted for a boxing match with Floyd Mayweather Jr. in August 2017 that paid him reportedly near $100 million.\n\nThe UFC 229 fight with Nurmagomedov is all he\u2019s had since then, and though he announced on Twitter in March that he was retiring \u2013 the same day a report of a first sexual assault allegation in Ireland dropped \u2013 he has said he wants to come back, and who he\u2019d like to fight.\n\nBut despite hints from White that things could be in the works for a McGregor return, nothing has come close to fruition. Earlier this week, White said a potential fight between McGregor and former lightweight champ Frankie Edgar wouldn\u2019t happen, despite both fighters apparently wanting it.\n\nJust about all the news McGregor has made since his loss to Nurmagomedov has been of the negative variety, and not fight-related. He has the two reported alleged sexual assault investigations in Ireland. He punched a man at a bar in Ireland and was caught on camera. He was caught on camera taking a man\u2019s phone outside a hotel in Miami Beach, smashing it, then walking away with it. And the bad-boy image truly kicked off when he threw a hand truck through the window of a bus carrying UFC 223 fighters in Brooklyn, including Nurmagomedov, which truly ignited their rivalry.\n\nGallery Khabib Nurmagomedov def.
