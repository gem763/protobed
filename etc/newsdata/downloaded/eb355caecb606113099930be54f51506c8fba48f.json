It began as a survey into general trends of advertising and media, but with the rise of video games and experiences around gaming, the report has increasingly focused on the world of video games.\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, the report's authors took Australian game publishers, government bodies and other industry members through the latest projections, offering some context and thoughts throughout. Here's some of the most interesting bits from that report.\n\nWhy the Foxtel/Netflix deal was so important\n\nImage: Netflix\n\nOne of the biggest deals in the Aussie landscape earlier this year was Foxtel's partnership with Netflix, a move that the internet and most commentators immediately viewed as an instant capitulation.\n\nBut as explained by lead author and PwC partner Justin Papps, the deal's actually a lot more complicated than that. From Foxtel's perspective, the problem isn't so much that users stop watching Foxtel to watch something on Netflix. It's the fact that they have no data or information about what a Foxtel owner does when they stop watching Foxtel. Knowing in advance that a user is switching over from Foxtel to Netflix, and vice versa, is a huge amount of information for the cable service, which can then be fed back into advertisers.\n\nThe deal now means that Foxtel has not only the ability to know the amount of time a user watches Netflix and Foxtel, but also what times they might be watching either service, what the likely average length of their preferred programs are, and more things about the kinds of content they watch outside of Foxtel. Coupled with individual user profiles, Foxtel has the ability to provide much more targeted ads for the people who are watching, which they can then sell at a much higher premium. Foxtel is already losing screentime and attention to Netflix, but if they can collect some of the data when people leave, then it'll at least help shore up the economics of the service.\n\nThe ACCC is looking very closely at loot boxes\n\nImage: PwC\n\nThe report's longest and most obvious correlation with the video game industry is the amount Aussie spend on hardware, software, and the various means in which we buy that. But it's also the area where the consultants run into the most trouble, because they're talking to an audience that knows the sector intimately well as the entire room is either reporting on it, or directly involved in the creation, promotion and distribution of games.\n\nThe main takeaways from the panel was an expected increase in the esports audience, which PwC anticipates will be worth $8 million in Australia by 2023 (around 18.3 percent growth over the next five years). But as members of the crowd asked during a Q&A afterwards, the industry is facing one of its strongest headwinds yet: the creation of third-party audited data.\n\nIf you're an advertiser or a brand, the biggest problem in local esports is data. Tournament organisations always provide their figures direct from Twitch, Facebook or whatever analytics they have, but none of it is independently verified. (A couple of people joked on the day that some tournaments and organisations had deliberately double counted their viewership figures.)\n\nSome of the crowd openly questioned whether the growth in Australian esports would continue once that independent verification kicked in, suggesting that sponsors and brands would be less than impressed with the \"real\" figures. I also questioned whether PwC's report took into account the high international viewership of local events and the nature of the Australian media landscape \u2014 local agencies and brands generally exclude all non-Australian audiences from their reporting.\n\nAs for esports, the crowd was told that the greater understanding of esports and the general growth of streaming and gaming as a medium would solidify the projections. It was noted that Twitch and YouTube weren't individually tracked in the report, but PwC stressed that gaming and live music would be tracked more closely for next year's report. The full release does note that \"esports will still be a fringe event\" for advertisers that want a broad reach, but anyone looking to invest in that intersection of play and gaming, a \"bespoke sponsorship package would be attractive\", with food, beverage and films getting some traction.\n\nAs for games hardware, the crowd was sceptical that physical consoles would decline with the release of a PS5 and new Xbox in 2020, the associated sales of new peripherals for those platforms, and even the prospect of rumours around an upgraded Nintendo Switch or a Nintendo Switch 2 in 2021 (which remains wholly unverified, but has been discussed in circles over the last 48 hours).\n\nThe most exciting live entertainment is live experiential gaming\n\nMost growth expected in this experiental live action, like the Marshmallow Fortnite concert and The Void, Disney's VR haptic vest experience at Disney Springs Orlando #PwCOutlook pic.twitter.com/yuqDJfWmW5 \u2014 Alex Walker (@dippizuka) October 3, 2019\n\nA key focus of the growing entertainment landscape locally is what Australia is doing with live events. Live gaming events are proving especially popular, whether it's esports (Australian esports attendees go to events with the intention of spending $600) or events like the Assassin's Creed symphonic orchestra. \"This whole idea of watching the concert and then going home and playing the game is blurring those lines,\" Papps told the crowd.\n\nThe most exciting element of that was The Void, a VR walkthrough adventure at Disney Springs where people put on a haptic suit and physically walk through corridors as a disguised Stormtrooper while you infiltrate a basic to steal Imperial intelligence. The suit provides feedback as the player gets shot, and the whole thing provides an experience that runs for about 20 minutes.\n\nDisney's biggest problem with The Void is that they can't get people through the experience fast enough, but it's also the perfect example of that intersection between live entertainment and gaming that works so well in today's climate. Discretionary income across Australian households is down, thanks to a crippling combination of stagnant wages/salary growth and rising household debt. The effect of that is that people tend to stay at home, and prefer cheaper experiences or subscriptions that have a low barrier for entry.\n\nHuge live experiences, particularly experiential ones that can't be replicated at home, are the kinds of entertainment that are likely to have the most growth and success over the next five years. Gamers still like spending money on premium events \u2014 they just want to be sure it'll be worth it.\n\nLego Masters was hugely popular\n\nImage: Nine\n\nThe PwC report touches on traditional media and the trends that are affecting free-to-air particularly. Naturally, free-to-air is having a tough time, but there was a real nice bright spot for Nine (which owns Kotaku Australia through Pedestrian Group) in Lego Masters.\n\nOver three million Australians watched the Lego Masters finale, both live and through broadcast on-demand services like 9now. Papps added that the show brought back what's known as \"appointment viewing\", where families would make a time in their weekly schedule to sit down to watch LEGO Masters, playing along as the challenges panned out in each episode. It's a nice touch not only for LEGO fans, but also for viewers who have gotten sick of the over dramatised nature of Australian TV.\n\nExcept a solid uptick in online ads\n\nOnline advertising has eaten into traditional ads across Australian media, and the most obvious effect of that has been the enormous chunk of revenue it's taken out of the large newspaper publishers. Google and Facebook have been the largest beneficiaries, but the Big Two is now the Big Three thanks to Amazon's advertising business opening in Australia this year.\n\n\"The most likely brands to be early adopters of Amazon Advertising are those whose product is stocked on the Amazon eCommerce site, in particular consumer electronic retailers,\" the PwC report says. Another oddity of the Australian market, however, is interest in online classifieds - particularly property listings. As Papps explained, Australians really like looking at properties they can't afford.\n\nDisney+ will hit the Australian market like a sledgehammer\n\nAustralians like streaming content, but we're starting to hit our limit with the amount of subscriptions we have. That's partially because of the income/household debt problem, although a PwC survey of 1000 Aussies found that most had 1.5 subscription services (typically Netflix and 'something else').\n\nThat 'something else' is liable to be Disney+ for a lot of families though, as Disney's content for kids looks set to absolutely clobber its rivals when it launches this November. Papps was adamant that Disney+ will be an absolute gamechanger in the Australian market.\n\nTo view the report in full, head to the PwC's Entertainment and Media Trends landing page.", "description": "Every year, professional consultants PwC compile an outlook of the Australian media and entertainment landscape, looking at the past 12 months and the likely changes over the next five years.
