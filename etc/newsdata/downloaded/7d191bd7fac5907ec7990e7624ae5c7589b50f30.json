He\u2019d been warned that if he supported a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit, his political career in Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party would be dead. But like 20 other terminated Tories, he put country before career. \u201cNo deal would be catastrophic,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe Boris project is coming off the rails.\u201d\n\nIn just six weeks as Britain\u2019s leader, Johnson has purged, and prorogued, and pontificated, and postured, and pronounced plenty of do-or-die piffle (it looks like die right now). He has lost his majority of one, his brother Jo, Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson, the good will of many Tories and several votes in the House of Commons. As for \u201cthe people,\u201d whom he claims to represent, Johnson never had them, having been elected by 92,153 members of his own party, most of them at the far end of actuarial tables. Hubris, thy name is Boris.\n\nYes, a grotesque hubris for Johnson, with no legitimacy, to think that he can railroad Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 \u2014 the most consequential political step in decades, precipitating mayhem in industrial supply chains, airports, ports and hospitals, as well as the possible breakup of the United Kingdom.\n\nBut the people voted for this in the 2016 referendum! No, they did not. They voted for the smooth, orderly exit promised by Johnson and his ilk. Chaos at Calais was not on the Brexiteers\u2019 make-believe menu. There is no evidence, none, that a majority of \u201cthe people\u201d want Johnson\u2019s no-deal Brexit.", "description": "The Johnson government is already a primer in ineptitude \u2014 and he hasn\u2019t even tried to buy Greenland.", "authors": ["Roger Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/opinion/06rogercohen/06rogercohen-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
