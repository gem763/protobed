This will include plastics.\n\nIt is thought that fewer than 60 per cent of bottles are currently being recycled in the UK (stock image)\n\nThe new powers will also allow for an extra levy to cover the costs of dealing with litter.\n\nManufacturers will be required by law to mark packaging so it is clear whether or not it can be recycled, and ministers will end the postcode lottery on collections.\n\nAt present, councils are free to decide what they recycle and there is a huge disparity on plastic waste, with some collecting every type \u2013 and some taking none at all.\n\nAround a third refuse to take 'rigid plastics' \u2013 including yoghurt pots and margarine tubs. Nationwide standards would ensure that as far as possible councils collect the same items.\n\nThe Bill will also give ministers the powers they need to introduce a deposit return scheme for plastic bottles.\n\nSuch initiatives have boosted recycling in European countries. It involves adding a small deposit to the cost of a drink \u2013 which ranges from 5p to 22p on the Continent.\n\nThe deposit is paid back when empties are returned to 'reverse vending machines' located in supermarkets.\n\nThe Mail has called for the introduction of such an initiative following the success of the 5p charge on single-use plastic bags.\n\nAn estimated 35million plastic bottles and 20million aluminium cans are sold in the UK every day.\n\nFewer than 60 per cent of bottles are recycled.\n\nThe Queen will not wear her Imperial Crown at the State of Opening of Parliament next week (pictured at State Opening of Parliament in 2016)\n\nIs Imperial Crown now too heavy?\n\nThe Queen will not wear her Imperial Crown at the State of Opening of Parliament next week in a significant break with tradition.\n\nThe decision will spark speculation that the crown \u2013 weighing 2.3lb and containing 2,868 diamonds, 273 pearls, 17 sapphires and 17 emeralds \u2013 is too heavy for the monarch to wear in her advancing years.\n\nInstead, the crown will be carried into the Houses of Parliament on Monday as a symbol of the Queen's authority, as it was the last time she chose not to wear it, in 2017.\n\nThe Queen, 93, is expected to wear the lighter George IV diadem.\n\nIt features four crosses alternating with bouquets representing different parts of the United Kingdom: roses, thistles and shamrocks.\n\nIt features 1,333 diamonds, although it was shrunk by Queen Alexandra in 1902, who removed 11 diamonds to fit her smaller head.\n\nThe Queen Mother also had it resized.", "description": "The Environmental Bill will give ministers the powers to create a bottle deposit scheme, make packaging producers cover the costs of dealing with litter, and will end the postcode lottery on recycling.", "authors": ["John Stevens Deputy Political Editor For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/00/19611400-0-image-a-122_1570836284947.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
