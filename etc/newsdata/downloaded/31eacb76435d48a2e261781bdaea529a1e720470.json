To mark the occasion, Intelligencer will be publishing \u201cState of the World,\u201d a series of in-depth interviews with climate leaders from Bill Gates to Naomi Klein and Rhiana Gunn-Wright to William Nordhaus, interrogating just how they see the precarious climate future of the planet \u2014 and just how hopeful they think we should all be about avoiding catastrophic warming. (Unfortunately, very few are hopeful.)\n\nRhiana Gunn-Wright is the policy director at the think tank New Consensus, where she is leading the development of the Green New Deal, which went from a fringe left-wing idea to the very center of Democratic Party climate policy in just a few months last fall. A former Rhodes scholar (and just 29), she was the policy director for Abdul el-Sayed\u2019s left-wing race for governor of Michigan in 2018. We talked in early September about just how fast climate politics have changed, what made them change, and why focusing on targets like two degrees may be sort of beside the point.\n\nNot that long ago, I thought that political changes like we\u2019ve seen in the last year were impossible. You\u2019ve been at the center of a lot of that. Is it as disorienting from the inside?\n\nIt might be different for folks who have been in the climate space longer. But for me, the same surprise and shock that you have, I feel all the time. You just don\u2019t see this sort of change this rapidly. When I first started in policy, I was at the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. Shout out to Heidi Hartmann \u2014 the president of that. She\u2019s been fighting for paid leave for decades now. At least 30 years in the game, and we\u2019re just now getting into a conversation like where candidates are putting out universal child-care policies, right? To start the Green New Deal a year ago and then see, not just people talk about it, but actual movement, like candidates competing on who can essentially invest the most and in the most places, right?\n\nWhen I came into the climate space, most of what I heard people talk about in public was like, at most, a hundred percent renewable energy. Now candidates \u2014 presidential candidates \u2014 are rolling out whole plans just on environmental justice. I have never seen that. And that\u2019s not just a difference of ambition, it\u2019s also such a difference of political perspective \u2014 not about getting to justice after we solve the renewable problem, but approaching justice right at the start. And that change in framing and perspective is what I\u2019m most proud of. In a year, a Democratic candidate would be really hard pressed to try to talk about the environment without talking about equity \u2014 to try to talk about climate change apart from justice.\n\nHow did that happen?\n\nI think about it often. The story of how it happened and the story of how the Green New Deal got this big are two different stories. And the origin story of how it literally happened is pretty short and normal. At New Consensus, the founders have been thinking for a while about a Green New Deal and what does it mean \u2014 what will it take to have an economic approach outside of neoliberalism? They made contact with the Sunrise Movement. And then I came on board. New Consensus was already connected to Justice Dems. This is before, you know, the squad had won their primaries, but they had all been endorsed by Justice Dems. By September, most had been through their primaries, if not all, and so that meant that new consensus was connected to this group of likely incoming freshmen. Ayana, Ilhan and Rashida, all of them were endorsed candidates, but AOC was recruited \u2014 Justice Dems was helping her run her campaign, so they were really intimately connected.\n\nSo, long story short, we have been working on the Green New Deal at New Consensus. I\u2019ve been talking to Sunrise at least for a bit about it. Sunrise had formulated an ask around green jobs, so they were planning a sit-in in Pelosi\u2019s office after the November elections. New Consensus was still talking to them about a Green New Deal, and so Sunrise decided to ask for a Green New Deal. AOC was able to come to the protest because of all of these connections, between Sunrise and JD and New Consensus. After that, it sort of took off like a rocket. And we\u2019re here now. And that\u2019s the story of, like, how it happened.\n\nYou make it sound so simple.\n\nWell, there\u2019s the question of, like, how does something take off like a rocket? I think the real, honest truth is that this moment has bred so many incredible organizers, and the Green New Deal is led at all fronts by organizers. New Consensus is founded by two organizers. Sunrise is organizing, right? It\u2019s an organizing organization, right? JD is run by organizers. They just do electoral work.\n\nI think, often, movement-building is built around issues or policies and not necessarily around a big vision. The Green New Deal started out as a big vision \u2014 and as a governing agenda. Unlike a lot of previous fights, it wasn\u2019t over a technical instrument, like a carbon tax. It also wasn\u2019t just about the environment as we sort of narrowly talk about it, whether that\u2019s conservation or carbon-dioxide emission. It is about all of it. And also about \u2014 how do we create an economy that works for people?\n\nYou\u2019re talking about breaking the neoliberal paradigm, where so much was about cost. You\u2019re talking about it in terms of benefits and opportunities to give people what they actually want from the government aid.\n\nYes. That was all by design. It wasn\u2019t on accident. And that\u2019s because this is a thing that \u2014 from policy to electoral \u2014 is really built from a movement perspective. What did people get excited about? What does it take to build strong movements?\n\nIt\u2019s also a signaling tool. Policy is always a signaling tool. Every policy is telling a story, right? You\u2019re saying \u201cThis is a problem, this is how we got here, this is how we\u2019ll fix it.\u201d People have to be able to see what they want out of their country and what they want out of their society, and they see that the Green New Deal is presenting an opportunity to move toward that \u2014 and possibly way further toward it \u2014 in one shot than we have done in a long time, if ever.\n\nI remember, actually, after AOC and the squad got elected, after those results came in, I was like, I don\u2019t think that people know what they did. They just unleashed the best organizers in the country onto DC. And I think we\u2019re now seeing what that means.\n\nI don\u2019t want to diminish the work of the organizers, but it\u2019s also the case that the public\u2019s moving on its own, right?\n\nYeah! I haven\u2019t been alive long enough to really say, but the pace at which major policy changes are going from being wacko to mainstream is, to me, unprecedented. Fight for 15 went from being crazy to the standard in a couple years. The organizing started a little earlier, from 2015 to 2018. Medicare for all went from being crazy \u2014 not just totally fucking crazy like in 2016, but to a lot of people in 2018, too \u2014 to \u2026 I mean, there\u2019s still some controversy around it, but most Democratic presidential front-runners support it or at least are trying to frame their own plans in relationship to it. We\u2019re seeing this massive turnover, and quick turnover, and a lot of ideas. And I think it\u2019s because our institutions are clearly not serving us the ways that we want. And a lot of these policies are just cutting to the quick of what people want, even if they are bypassing what consultants would say you should do.\n\nBut ultimately, it will produce some policy instruments, right?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nI know the stickiest things in this world are nuclear and carbon capture. But in general, how do you process those fights into policy?\n\nIt\u2019s tough, but for me, I always start from a place where \u2014 and I truly believe this \u2014 the people who suffer the most, or stand to suffer the most, should have a disproportionate say in what happens and how that thing is responded to. I don\u2019t think we often talk about it much, but I think most of the time, the people who are making choices will not be affected by the choices that they are making when it comes to policy. They won\u2019t use the system. You can say \u201cYes nuclear,\u201d but most of those people at that meeting won\u2019t live next to a nuclear plant. Nothing\u2019s going to happen to their groundwater if there\u2019s an issue.\n\nBut that can be hard, because to get different communities to talk to you requires building trust, right? I\u2019m always sort of thinking about how to do that. And we are constantly working to like build relationships so that we can do that. But there\u2019s been so much energy around the Green New Deal \u2014 a lot of communities are already organizing themselves to say what they do and do not want, why they want these things, why they don\u2019t want these things. And there\u2019s a framework I learned from Fannie Shimbashi at People\u2019s Action: red lines, yellow lines, and green lines. Red lines are what you do not absolutely want, green lines or what you want, and yellow lines are \u2014 this is not not ideal or not preferred, but it is acceptable under the circumstances. Often we don\u2019t actually have a discussion about yellow lines. We either have red lines or green lines and stop there. And so a lot of my work is figuring out how we structure processes and build trust, so that we can have conversations and then write policy out of a yellow-line space if that is in fact possible.\n\nYou\u2019re talking about building policy, working with communities, and building trust. There\u2019s also just the climate timeline. And the IPCC has many limitations, but in all of their scenarios that keep us below two degrees, there are negative emissions. That timeline is scary to me. Can we get there? If we really have to roughly halve our emissions globally by 2030, I\u2019m like \u2026 even with the movement we have, that seems like a really long shot.\n\nI totally understand when you\u2019re talking about what needs to happen in order to think about or get us to below two degrees, or 1.5 degrees \u2014 people have different thresholds that they talk about. And the timeline is challenging.\n\nI should preface this by saying, like, I\u2019m a depressive, so you know, it is what it is. But I think that a lot of life is pain, right? Not on purpose. It\u2019s just sort of natural human condition. And one of the best things that you can hope for is that you just, in life, have the privilege to pick what kind of pain you want in some situation and how you\u2019re going to take it on. And I feel like that about the Green New Deal, just in the sense that like, yes, it\u2019s painful. I don\u2019t know how it will end, but it is a fight that needs to be fought.\n\nAnd whether or not we decarbonize in 10 or 12 years \u2026 That\u2019s not on this movement alone. It\u2019s not on Sunrise alone. It\u2019s not on Climate Strike. It\u2019s not on any of these organizations alone. And just knowing that, even at two degrees, how many people can die, and how many places will be lost, how the places that have shaped people will be lost \u2014 because people aren\u2019t just shaped by other people, they\u2019re literally shaped by their physical space and community. One of my good friends, Dr. Kate Marvel, she\u2019s at NASA \u2014\n\nShe\u2019s great.\n\nAnd she says one of the things that frightens her most about climate change isn\u2019t what will happen to the weather or what will happen physically, but what people will do to one another.\n\nAnd for me, I recognize that right now, right now, the U.S. is structured by unmitigated unregulated capitalism. Everything is a private market and there\u2019s no public safety net. Your access to pollution \u2014 how many toxins you are allowed to breathe \u2014 is patterned by where you live, which is patterned by who you are, what race you are, what gender. The way that we\u2019re structured right now brings out the worst in us. I don\u2019t worry a ton about whether we decarbonize on time, because either way the Green New Deal is moving us far closer to a policy and therefore to settings within which people feel more supported and are able to act out of the best of themselves.", "description": "Rhiana Gunn-Wright, policy director at the think tank New Consensus and a co-author of the Green New Deal, talks about the rapid evolution of climate change policy and why focusing on targets like two degress may be beside the point.", "authors": ["David Wallace-Wells"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/19/19-climate-rhiana-gunn-wright.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
