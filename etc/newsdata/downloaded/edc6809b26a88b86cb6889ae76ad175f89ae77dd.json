Since the Sunday before last, the price of the cryptocurrency has shed some 15%, leaving many traders stumped as to what in the world took place to send digital assets plummeting.\n\nCynics of the Bitcoin market have suggested that the rally to $14,000 and the subsequent dump was \u201cone final pump and dump\u201d enacted by whales. Gold proponent Peter Schiff, for instance, claimed that this move is a precursor to a plunge to $4,000, potentially lower.\n\nBut, data has shown that it isn\u2019t these whales causing Bitcoin\u2019s recent volatility, it\u2019s the short-term traders presumably looking to make a quick buck.\n\nBitcoin Drop Led by Traders\n\nCoinmetrics recently published to Twitter a chart that tracked the \u201cchange in the number of Bitcoin by price at time of last on-chain movement\u201d for September 20th to 29th.\n\nAs seen below, the industry analytics startup found that during the recent price decline, \u201cthere was activity from Bitcoin that last moved when prices were between $13,000 and $20,000\u201d, implying that capitulation for those in the red \u201cis complete\u201d.\n\nThere were other optimistic signs. Two, in fact.\n\nFirstly, quite heavy selling from Bitcoin last moved in the $10,000 to $12,000 range hints that the sell-off was a byproduct of \u201cshort-term traders that have weak long-term conviction\u201d.\n\nAnd secondly, as there was little profit-taking from long-term holders that accumulated under $8,000, meaning that this subset\u2019s \u201cbull market psychology remains unchanged.\u201d\n\nCryptocurrency analytics firm Glassnode has corroborated this analysis. They found that the average age of moved coins over recent days \u201cis between 20-30 days\u201d, while the CoinDays Destroyed metric \u201chasn\u2019t deviated significantly\u201d.\n\nThis data can be interpreted as a sign that the \u201c[price drop] was likely due to short-term holders,\u201d which is partially proven by the massive volumes seen on BitMEX and other high time preference exchanges during this move lower.\n\nAccording to #onchain metrics, #Bitcoin's recent drop to $8k doesn't seem to have been caused by long term holders. The average age of moved coins is between 20-30 days & CDD hasn't deviated significantly. This was likely due to short term $BTC holders.https://t.co/GyiQGuZUJY pic.twitter.com/cjix8bOiBM \u2014 glassnode (@glassnode) September 27, 2019\n\nThe Accumulation Game\n\nShort-term traders may have run for the hills, but HODLers, on the other hand, have been sticking to their guns.\n\nAccording to an analysis completed by Twitter account \u201cBitcoinEconomics.io\u201d, accumulation by addresses it deems \u201ccompanies\u201d, \u201cretail holders\u201d, and \u201cbig holders\u201d has been on a steady uptrend, even throughout the recent bout of volatility. They claim that this is a sign that the \u201coutlook for Bitcoin looks great\u201d.\n\nThe outlook for Bitcoin looks great: Steady retail adoption. Companies and big holders accumulating more. 45% retired hodlers inbetween that do not accumulate anymore but only sold 5%. Note the extreme 500k BTC pump and dump from April to August 2019. pic.twitter.com/CTbg43qQHn \u2014 BitcoinEconomics.io (@BitcoinEcon) October 1, 2019\n\nWhat all these investors seem to be waiting for is Bitcoin\u2019s next block reward reduction \u2014 known as a \u201chalving\u201d or \u201chalvening\u201d. You see, in May 2020, the issuance (inflation) of BTC will be cut in half as a result of baked-in facets of the Bitcoin protocol. Analysts say that this halving event, which equates to a negative supply shock, will boost BTC to fresh heights.\n\nDue to this potential for upside, or at least the hype surrounding this narrative, investors are believed to be stacking satoshis (as they fondly call the game of Bitcoin accumulation) in anticipation of price upside.\n\nWhether or not that upside comes to fruition, however, remains to be seen. But many sure seem to be betting on it.\n\nFeatured Image from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin hasn't had the past ten days.
