No doubt that despite a plethora of promises to resolve Sino-U.S. trade war; uncertainty continue to loom till both the countries seal a final deal. The World Economic Outlook report spells out in sharp detail the economic difficulties caused by the U.S.-China tariffs, including direct costs, market turmoil, reduced investment and lower productivity due to supply chain disruptions. To watch my upcoming videos on S&P 500, click here.\n\nI find that the S&P 500 seems to be near its immediate resistance at 3003, which provides stiff resistance; looks ready to provide good opportunity to bears amid growing hopes and fear of currently prevailing global economic slowdown. No doubt that the investors look ready to take all risk over the positive outcome, which has resulted in a gap-up opening of S&P 500 on Tuesday, but every possibilities still looks still full of skepticism due to the following reasons:-\n\n1. Sudden tilt in President Donald Trump\u2019s final view even over the terms and conditions of partial deal due to any counter condition by Chinese delegation.\n\n2. Despite after a strong opening S&P 500 still seems to be under stiff resistance at the level of 2989.\n\n3. Despite after a steep fall, have been still maintaining above the strong support at $1465; which confirms a strong reversal.\n\n4. S&P 500 Futures look ready to show exhaustive move, if they are not able to maintain above 2889.\n\n5. Finally, every move in U.S. equity markets still hope-based; which enhances the quantum of probabilities.\n\nTrading Strategy: Short Position\n\nEntry Level: 3003 \u2013 3009\n\nStop Loss: 3011 - 3021\n\nTarget: 2929 - 2939\n\nProfit Probability: 70 points\n\nLoss Probability: 10 points\n\nRisk/Reward Ratio: 1:7\n\nS&P 500 - Daily Chart\n\nS&P 500 - 4 Hr.
