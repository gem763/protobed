The service added that U.S. personnel have flown to the airport for years and that all travel arrangements to Turnberry were made through appropriate channels.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Department seems to have been driven to respond to recent press reports, the Committee does not understand why the Department has delayed responding to this request for so long without any legitimate explanation,\u201d Maryland Democratic Reps. Elijah Cummings and Jamie Raskin wrote in the letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper. \u201cIf the Department does not begin producing the requested documents this week, the Committee will be forced to consider alternative measures to compel compliance, including a subpoena.\u201d\n\nTrump said Monday that he was not involved in decisions to refuel U.S. military planes at Prestwick and have service members stay at Turnberry. He said he doesn't own the airport and has \"nothing to do with\" it, despite the fact that the Trump Organization announced an \"official partnership\" with the airport five years ago.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump and his company have had significant, direct, and detailed interactions with Prestwick Airport for years, including the President proclaiming that he was \u2018thrilled to be partnering\u2019 with the airport, the President personally trying to boost passenger traffic at the airport, and the Trump Organization negotiating room rates directly with the airport,\u201d Cummings and Raskin wrote. \u201cThese and other actions by the President and his company reflect how critical this airport is to his financial bottom-line.\u201d", "description": "The Pentagon has yet to respond to a June letter, but the Air Force said on Sunday night that it was reviewing procedures for airport stops.", "authors": ["David Brown"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/ab/d7/b6a9bf864d14bb2c5e1f45cfc446/1983-elijah-cummings-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
