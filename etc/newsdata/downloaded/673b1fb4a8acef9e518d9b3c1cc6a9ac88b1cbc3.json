That is the mentality we are trying to create,\" said Silva.\n\n\"And I use that because it has to be a turning point for us, because we have all the conditions to do that, full confidence in our players to be able to play in our stadium... it's a good start to the match, thinking of it like a must-win.\"\n\nEverton have lost four games in a row and five league games in total so far this season.\n\nWest Ham on the other hand have had a solid start to this campaign leaving them in 8th place in the Premier League. However, they lost a close fought game to Crystal Palace in their last fixture and will be looking to regain some momentum.\n\nA dominant performance against Manchester United at home showed that West Ham have the quality to be competitive against any opposition this season. But away to a desperate Everton side will be a challenge for the Hammers.\n\n\"I think we're where we deserve to be and we're clear in what we need to improve,\" said Manuel Pellegrini.\n\n\"It's always a difficult team at Goodison Park. They have good players. We beat them 3-1 last season when we were in a similar moment to they are (in) now.\n\n\"But seasons are different and I'm sure we'll find an Everton with high pace, and it'll be a difficult game. It doesn't matter if they've been losing the last games.\"", "description": "In form left back Aaron Cresswell will miss today's game which is a blow to the hammers.", "authors": ["Jake Goodwill", "James Ducker", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/19/TELEMMGLPICT000208061006-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1N76_h4kJYCSBjfocyQ34Zm4blVxyqRbm0UHoXE5Lyo.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
