Photo: Getty Images\n\n\u201cEverybody makes mistakes. / Everybody has those days. / Everybody occasionally flies their family out to Ibiza on a private jet even though they know that\u2019s not environmentally sound.\u201d\n\nThat was a remake of the song \u201cNobody\u2019s Perfect,\u201d by Hannah Montana (Miley Cyrus), rewritten for Prince Harry, who on Tuesday addressed the recent criticism regarding he and his family\u2019s use of private jets, People reports.\n\n\u201cWe can all do better and while no one is perfect, we all have a responsibility for our own individual impact,\u201d he said, echoing the 2006 Disney hit, at an event in Amsterdam. \u201cThe question is what we do to balance it out.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about it during a Q&A session later, the usually environmentally conscious prince went on: \u201cI came here by commercial. I spend 99 percent of my life traveling the world by commercial. Occasionally, there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure my family are safe and it\u2019s genuinely as simple as that.\u201d\n\nThe prince\u2019s comments are a good reminder that, at the end of the day, as cool and glamorous as we may be, we\u2019re also flawed. Harry sometimes flies private for security purposes. Miley Cyrus got kicked off the film Hotel Transylvania because she bought her boyfriend a penis cake. I recently washed my underwear in the shower because I was too lazy to do laundry. Three very similar examples that show we\u2019re all basically the same! As Hannah Montana sang before she bought that penis cake:\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s perfect! / I gotta work it! (work it!) / Again and again till I get it right! / Nobody\u2019s perfect!\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
