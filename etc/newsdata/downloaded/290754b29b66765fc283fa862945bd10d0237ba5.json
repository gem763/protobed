I love it here. This is one of the best clubs in the world and I\u2019m here for the long haul. But you just don\u2019t know what happens in the future. I\u2019m still young and, like I say, I am loving every minute. Ever since I was a kid, 100 per cent it\u2019s always been a dream of mine to play abroad somewhere. It would be nice one day to finish training and go home and sit in your garden and eat some dinner. I would need to see where it\u2019s minimum 17C or 18C constantly.\u2019\n\nThere is also a sense of forward planning on City\u2019s part. Ten of Sterling\u2019s 12 England goals have come in the last year and his profile is likely to skyrocket if England make it into the final stages of the European Championships this summer.\n\nCity hope to sit down with the forward\u2019s representatives in the New Year to discuss an extension that would reflect the progression Sterling has made since his last renewal.\n\nThe club feel it is imperative to reward the squad for their performances and they handed new deals to the likes of Aymeric Laporte and Ederson just 12 months into their stints at the Etihad.\n\nMORE: Unai Emery sends message to Mesut Ozil after Arsenal midfielder\u2019s latest interview", "description": "Manchester City are keen on handing Raheem Sterling a new contract less than 12 months after his previous renewal, Metro.co.uk can reveal.
