It is unclear whether Robinson was aware of any plans to bring people to the UK.\n\nThe lorry, which police said was from Bulgaria, was later driven away past a cordon of officers who bowed their heads and removed their hats.\n\nThe lorry had a Carrier refrigeration unit attached to it. Media reports suggested the area where the bodies were found may have been refrigerated and the migrants could have frozen to death in temperatures as low as -25C.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The lorry\u2019s 25-year-old driver, Mo Robinson, has been arrested on suspicion of murder.

But amid a swirl of information, they later said the trailer \u2013 the rear section of the vehicle, containing the bodies \u2013 travelled from Zeebrugge into Purfleet, Essex, and arrived in the Thurrock area shortly after 12.30am.\n\nThe tractor unit \u2013 the cab section at the front in which the driver sits \u2013 travelled separately from Northern Ireland. Robinson is believed to have picked up the trailer minutes before the ambulance service was alerted.\n\nOn a day of fast-moving developments:\n\nBulgaria\u2019s foreign ministry said the Scania lorry was registered in Varna, a city on the country\u2019s east coast, under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen.\n\nThe ministry said police had said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the victims were Bulgarians.\n\nOfficers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) were brought in to investigate the possible role of gangs.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland said it was supporting the Essex police investigation, while the Irish police, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, said they would \u201cprovide every assistance possible\u201d.\n\nIn an unrelated incident, nine undocumented migrants were found alive in a lorry on the M20 in Kent and were being dealt with by immigration authorities.\n\nForensic police dressed in white coveralls were seen going in and out of the vehicle in Grays throughout the day. It remained behind a cordon until shortly before 5pm when it was escorted by a number of police vehicles to nearby Tilbury Docks.\n\nTributes to the unidentified victims were led by the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who said he was \u201cappalled by this tragic incident\u201d. It is the worst incident of its kind in the UK since the bodies of 58 Chinese people were found in a container in Dover, Kent, in 2000.\n\nCh Supt Andrew Mariner, of Essex police, said: \u201cThis is a tragic incident where a large number of people have lost their lives. Our inquiries are ongoing to establish what has happened. We are in the process of identifying the victims; however, I anticipate that this could be a lengthy process.\u201d\n\nRichard Burnett, the chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said: \u201cThe National Crime Agency have been warning that traffickers are getting more sophisticated and ruthless all the time. We\u2019ve had traffickers climb on top of trucks and unbolt the entire door to let people in and then reattach it and it looks like the seal on the door hasn\u2019t been tampered with.\u201d\n\nThe Scania lorry\u2019s windscreen carried a sticker reading \u201cIreland, the ultimate dream\u201d, and a number of dream-catcher pendants were hanging from the centre of the windscreen. The sticker matched one on an identical-looking cab pictured on Robinson\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nThe East of England ambulance service declined to elaborate on the circumstances in which it was made aware of the incident, saying only that it was called in the early hours of Wednesday and sent five ambulances, hazardous area response teams and a car from Essex and Herts air ambulance.\n\nVehicles from the British Red Cross attended the scene at the request of Thurrock council. The charity said its staff and volunteers were providing emotional support to members of the emergency services and others dealing with the tragedy.\n\nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, said Home Office immigration officials were working closely with the police to establish what had happened.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The lorry is driven away from the scene.

We are working with partners including Essex police and immigration enforcement to provide specialist support to urgently identify and take action against any organised crime groups who might have played a role in causing these deaths.\u201d\n\nPatel appeared before the home affairs select committee on Wednesday afternoon and signalled that she was willing to consider tougher sentences for human traffickers and people smugglers.\n\nThe independent MP John Woodcock asked if Patel would commit to reviewing sentencing guidelines for human trafficking. She replied: \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019m very happy to discuss with the Ministry of Justice to see what more we can do.\u201d\n\nJohnson tweeted: \u201cI am receiving regular updates and the Home Office will work closely with Essex police as we establish exactly what has happened.\u201d\n\nJackie Doyle-Price, MP for the Thurrock seat which includes Grays, said: \u201cPeople trafficking is a vile and dangerous business. This is a big investigation for Essex police. Let\u2019s hope they bring these murderers to justice.\u201d\n\nThe former director-general of immigration enforcement at the Home Office told the BBC the route thought to have been taken by the lorry container was \u201cunusual\u201d.\n\nDavid Wood said: \u201cIt is an unusual route, of course, because Zeebrugge is a freight and container port so not a port where there would be a focus on immigration-type checks and nor would Purfleet be a port where they would be greatly geared up for immigration checks ... On the face of it, it would be a pretty clear route for organised criminals to use.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting: Lisa O\u2019Carroll, Rory Carroll and Nazia Parveen", "description": "Murder investigation launched alongside inquiry into possible role of organised crime groups", "authors": ["Jamie Grierson", "Henry Mcdonald", "Esther Addley", "Damien Gayle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75b4ac6b2d5b1d3735e2141db45789735120a99c/0_70_2329_1397/master/2329.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cad1cc5d1bf55bba27f690e053f56194", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
