This week, we\u2019re tackling a question from a reader who finds it annoying when his browser prompts him to save passwords on a service he\u2019d rather not use. Does this sound like you? Read on.\n\nLifehacker reader John writes:\n\n\u201cI read your article about 1Password and Watchtower and I was wondering if you knew of any way to sync 1Password with Keychain? I have 1Password on Mac, iPhone, iPad, and on my Windows PC at work. It seems that, when I enter credentials on a website in Safari, it offers to save the credentials to Keychain or 1Password, choosing seemingly at random, and never to both. As a result, I often need a password that I don\u2019t have easily available because it is in Keychain but not 1Password.\u201d\n\nAh, I know this problem well \u2014 having your logins and passwords all over the place, which makes it difficult to remember which service you\u2019re using to save which passwords.\n\nMy initial advice is to drop Keychain like a bad habit. Nothing against it, but if you already have 1Password, you should simply pretend Keychain doesn\u2019t exist. There\u2019s no need to split your passwords across two services, because that leads to lots of confusion, as you\u2019re now experiencing.\n\nWere I you, I\u2019d start by checking out this importer utility, which should hopefully help you get your Mac\u2019s Keychain passwords into 1Password without issue. You can also do things the manual way.\n\nPull up Keychain Access (by typing that into Spotlight) and look through your \u201clogin\u201d and \u201ciCloud\u201d Keychains to see what you\u2019ve saved. Double-click on the entries to find your user names and logins, make a new entry in 1Password, and repeat. This might take some time if you have a lot of logins, but it\u2019s worth the effort.\n\nFrom there, pull up Safari, launch its preferences, and click on the \u201cAutofill\u201d tab. Turn off all the options, which should get Safari to stop prompting you about Keychain. (You can also uncheck the option under the \u201cPasswords\u201d tab instead.)\n\nScreenshot: David Murphy\n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re using it, but just in case, make sure you\u2019ve also installed 1Password 7 for your Mac and turned on the extension in Safari (via the \u201cExtensions\u201d tab in Preferences). This way, you\u2019ll be prompted by 1Password \u2014 not Safari \u2014 to save your passwords on sites.\n\nFrankly, I find 1Password to be a little fussy to use on Safari (perhaps that\u2019s just me). You can also switch to a different browser entirely, like Chrome or Firefox, which might make the password-saving process with 1Password (versus Keychain) even easier.", "description": "Welcome back to our weekly technology-advice column.
