The Straits Times\n\nSingapore is now the world\u2019s most competitive economy after beating out the United States, which was last year\u2019s number one, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said on Wednesday (Oct 9).\n\nThe US now sits in second spot, where Singapore was placed last year, in the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) published with the Global Competitiveness Report 2019.\n\nThe annual GCI ranks 141 economies through 103 indicators organised into 12 pillars: institutions, infrastructure, Information and communications technology (ICT) adoption, macroeconomic stability, health, skills, product market, labour market, financial system, market size, business dynamism, and innovation capability.\n\nAs this year\u2019s world number one, Singapore earned an overall score of 84.8, up from last year\u2019s 83.5.\n\nSingapore ranked first on three pillars: infrastructure, health and labour market. It also came in second for institutions (losing to Finland), product market and financial system (both losing to Hong Kong).\n\nAccording to the report, Singapore scored full marks on the pillar for health, which is an assessment of health-adjusted life expectancy.\n\nThe Republic also scored close to full marks (99.7) on macroeconomic stability, but was ranked 38th because 35 other economies, including Malaysia, scored a perfect 100. France and the US each scored 99.8 and ranked 36th and 37th respectively.\n\nThe US, which remains the world\u2019s most competitive large economy, saw its overall score fall from 85.6 in 2018 to 83.7 in 2019.\n\nNonetheless, the US ranks first on the pillar of business dynamism and second on the innovation capability pillar.\n\nAt third place on the GCI is Singapore\u2019s longtime rival Hong Kong, which saw its ranking rise one spot with an improved score of 83.1 from 82.3 in 2018.\n\nIn May this year, Singapore was also named the world\u2019s most competitive economy, overtaking Hong Kong and the US in the World Competitiveness Ranking compiled by Swiss business school IMD.\n\nThe most improved economy in WEF\u2019s index this year was Vietnam, which rose 10 places from 2018 to 67th spot this year.\n\nWhen comparing regions, Asia-Pacific is the most competitive in the world, followed closely by Europe and North America.\n\nOn average, the 141 economies scored a dismal 61 points over 100. \u201cThis global competitiveness gap is of even more concern as the global economy faces the prospect of a downturn,\u201d the WEF said.\n\nHowever, some of this year\u2019s better performers \u2013 including Singapore and Vietnam \u2013 appear to be benefiting from the trade feud through trade diversion, WEF added.\n\n\u201cThe report shows that those countries which integrate into their economic policies an emphasis on infrastructure, skills, research and development and support those left behind are more successful compared to those that focus only on traditional factors of growth.\u201d said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the WEF.\n\nIn a statement, the WEF said that the global economy \u201cremains locked in a cycle of low or flat productivity growth despite the injection of more than US$10 trillion by central banks\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhile these unprecedented measures were successful in averting a deeper recession, they are not enough on their own to catalyse the allocation of resources towards productivity-enhancing investments in the private and public sectors,\u201d it said.\n\nNoting that monetary policies are starting to run out of steam, the WEF said it is now \u201ccrucial for economies to rely on fiscal policy and public incentives to boost research and development, enhance the skills base of the current and future workforce, develop new infrastructure and integrate new technologies\u201d.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Singapore scored full marks on the pillar for health, which is an assessment of health-adjusted life expectancy..
