I don\u2019t think anyone in the industry can defend this.\u201d\n\nThe Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses said they had been monitoring one abattoir north of Brisbane for two years and claimed it slaughtered 500 horses a month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an abattoir that kills horses for human consumption,\u201d the group\u2019s Elio Celotto told ABC, which broadcast secretly filmed footage it claimed showed workers beating and abusing horses.\n\n\u201c(The meat) goes to various countries in Europe, it goes to Japan, and Russia\u2019s a big importer as well,\u201d added Celotto.\n\nThe ABC said it forensically cross-matched horses slaughtered there, using microchips and brandings, to the industry\u2019s official online record of thoroughbreds, the Australian Stud Book.\n\nIt revealed around 300 racehorses, with combined prize money of almost Aus$5 million (US$3.4 million), went through the abattoir in just 22 days.\n\nRacing Victoria chief executive Giles Thompson said he was \u201csickened by the horrific images\u201d, which emerged just days ahead of the world\u2019s richest turf race, The Everest in Sydney, and the annual Melbourne Cup next month.\n\n\u201cEquine welfare is a non-negotiable for the Australian racing industry and the goal of ensuring a home for every healthy thoroughbred as it exits the racing industry must remain a priority for all,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, when thoroughbred horses retire their owners must inform Racing Australia of their plans for the animal.\n\nBut the sport\u2019s peak body said in a statement that any subsequent change of ownership once it left the industry could not be legally tracked.\n\nTo counter this, it is backing a National Horse Traceability Register, which is currently being considered by the national government.\n\n\u201cA National Horse Register would fill this gap, allow federal and state authorities access to ownership and location information and help improve equine welfare outcomes nationally,\u201d it said.", "description": "Sydney (AFP) \u2013 Australia\u2019s thoroughbred industry was reeling Friday after an investigation revealed the mass, and sometimes inhumane, killing", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/17/fa4864_slaughter-racehorses-is-not-illegal-in-australia-an-undercover-abc-probe-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
