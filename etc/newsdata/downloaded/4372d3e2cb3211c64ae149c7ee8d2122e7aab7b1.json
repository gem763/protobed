Their goal? \u2018A full belly laugh.\u2019\n\nHope\u2019s father, Daniel Claiborne, texted her a photo of Belford so they\u2019d be able to identify the woman.\n\nAD\n\nUpdate: 6:36 p.m. the missing person has been located. She is safe and has been reunited with her family. Many thanks... Posted by City of Roseville, California Police Department on Monday, September 30, 2019\n\nAfter breaking briefly for dinner (Logan also had to bandage a few scrapes after taking a spill on his bike), the kids hopped back on their bicycles and did another search in their community, 20 miles from Sacramento. They scanned parking lots and playgrounds, looked behind bushes and even checked at their elementary school.\n\nThen, at 6:30 p.m., just before dusk, Hope saw her: a petite elderly woman with pale gray hair, slowly approaching a street corner in a red button-down shirt and white pants.\n\n\u201cLook! There she is!\u201d Hope recalled telling the others.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Yes! Guys, that has to be her,\u2019 \u201d Logan recalled.\n\nIf Belford had kept walking, Logan said, she would have soon ended up on one of the busiest streets in Roseville.\n\n\u201cI was so excited to find her. We all went over to her and asked, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 \u201d Hope said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t really understand us and told us to go away.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis restaurant is starting a monthly \u2018dementia friendly\u2019 night\n\nWhile the other kids distracted Belford and kept talking to her, Hope dialed 911 and told the dispatcher that they\u2019d found the lost woman.\n\n\u201cThe dispatcher was a little surprised to hear a young voice on the line,\u201d said Rob Baquera, public information officer for the Roseville Police Department.\n\n\u201cBecause [Belford] has dementia, there was an urgency to find her before she went off on a trail into the woods or ended up on a street with lots of traffic,\u201d Baquera said, adding that he thought it was the first time she\u2019d wandered away from her care center.\n\nAD\n\nLess than a minute after the dispatcher learned where the children and Belford were, a police cruiser arrived at the scene, and Belford was quickly returned to her care center, Baquera said.\n\n\u201cWhat could have been a much larger crisis was diverted by these junior detectives who jumped into action,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nPerhaps no one is more proud of the kids' quick thinking than their parents.\n\n\u201cPeople are amazed by what they did in a time when so many kids are inside on their phones,\u201d said Alyssa Hultman, 33, a single mother to Logan and his brother, Zachary, 13. \u201cChildren don\u2019t often play outside anymore.\"\n\nHope and Kashton's father said he didn't take them seriously at first when they said they were going to search for Belford on their bikes.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI sent them a picture of her and thought, \u2018Okay, have fun,\u2019 \u201d said Claiborne, 37, a single father. \u201cBut they were genuinely determined that they were going to find her. When they ran inside later, yelling that they\u2019d found her, I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nKashton had a simple answer for why they decided to look for the woman.\n\n\u201cThe four of us just decided that we could do it,\u201d Kashton said.\n\nMakenna had a different take:\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to find Belford and prove that kids can make just as big a difference as adults,\u201d she said.\n\nRead more:\n\nA woman meets the stranger whose life she saved\n\nEmployees at this Florida bar pulled about $14,000 off the walls \u2014 and they\u2019re donating it to Hurricane Dorian relief\n\nWhy this man put up billboards proclaiming, \u2018Amy, I love you more!\u2019\n\nAD", "description": "They heard on the helicopter loudspeaker that police were seeking volunteers to find a 97-year-old with dementia who had wandered away from her care center.", "authors": ["Cathy Free"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/QgrBftMIy00ccgrqQ1EgVNe7RXs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NN5QQTWK25GCZOG3H6SEDDNJ6Q.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
