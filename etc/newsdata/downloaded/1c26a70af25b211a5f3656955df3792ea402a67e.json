I remember an old professor of mine (in the good ole days when education was considered functional rather than cosmetic!) told me to present my hypothesis and would find appropriate statistics (from \"reliable sources\") to back them up. One doesn't have to be a mathematical genius to realize that an increase in wages at the bottom has a pyramid effect on wages above the bottom. Thus a small business with say 14 employees, 6 of whom are at the bottom, a minimum wage increase from $8 to $10 would be an 11% total cost increase if no others above got an wage increase. However, if others up the pyramid got a $2 increase, total labour costs go up by 21%. If you are the owner, you either raise your prices to accommodate the increase or see your profits fall by commensurate percentage. Guess what happens. Prices go up, sales tax revenue goes up (Governments are happy!), relative income inequality goes up or at best, stays the same, and inflation (the cruelest tax of all- except for Governments who spend more than they take in!) goes up. But the semi literate population is mollified until the next cycle of poverty rises! A pencil and paper and simple arithmetic is all that's needed to see and understand this! Turn off your computer and cell phone though, to avoid distraction!", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/veXtvdoYG_CsdLTazCsG4g--~B/aD0xNTAwO3c9MTUwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/town_country_721/f8b6486cc7fcfc48be63c810e8cf59d9", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
