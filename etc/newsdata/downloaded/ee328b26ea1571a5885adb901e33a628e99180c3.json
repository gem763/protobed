U.S. gold futures were 0.4% lower at $1,467.20 per ounce.\n\nThe dollar\u2019s potential to gain further and some optimism around a potential trade deal between Washington and Beijing weighed on gold, said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets.\n\n\u201cWe also broke through the $1,480-$1,490 support level and on a technical basis that in itself is enough to spur further selling,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies climbed to a more than two-year high, as investors waited for September U.S. manufacturing data to determine how far policymakers will go to bolster growth.\n\nAsian shares ticked up as some investors clung to hopes that the fourth quarter will bring progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade war that has cast a shadow over the global economy.\n\n\u201cGold is likely to stay volatile ahead of the October trade talks,\u201d said Hareesh V, head of commodity research at Geojit Financial Services.\n\nGold prices could head towards the $1,420 level in the near term if any signs of easing in the Sino-U.S. tensions emerge and the dollar continues to strengthen, Hareesh added.\n\nMeanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro dismissed reports that the Trump administration was considering delisting Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nChina and the United States are due to resume high-level trade talks next week in Washington. While the dispute over trade and technology between the world\u2019s two largest economies has intensified, some investors are sticking to hopes of a compromise.\n\nOn the technical front, spot gold may break a support at $1,462 per ounce and fall towards $1,446, according to Reuters analyst Wang Tao.\n\nIndicative of investor sentiment, holdings at SPDR Gold Trust, the world\u2019s largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.22% to 920.83 tonnes on Monday.\n\nAmong other precious metals, deficit-hit palladium was down 0.2% at $1,671.40 per ounce, having scaled a record peak of $1,700.71 on Monday.\n\nPlatinum rose 0.1% to $882.96 per ounce.
