This potential bearishness comes as the crypto sees an influx of network activity and heightened trading volume.\n\nAnalysts are now noting that there is a chance Ethereum drops as low as $160 in the near term if it fails to decisively break above the upper boundary of a bullish ascending triangle that it is currently trading within.\n\nEthereum Stable in Mid-$180 Region as Network Activity Blossoms\n\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading up just under 2% at its current price of $185.71, which marks a notable climb from its daily lows of under $180 that were set earlier today.\n\nEver since Bitcoin incurred its parabolic rally from lows of $7,300 to highs of $10,600, Ethereum has been closely tracking BTC\u2019s price action, and is currently sitting below its recent highs of just under $200 that were set at the peak of the rally.\n\nThis massive volatility has helped ETH garner some increased network activity, however, as TokenAnalyst \u2013 a popular analytics group on Twitter \u2013 recently noted that the number of active senders and recipients both rose roughly 14% over the past 24-hours, while its on-chain volume surged a whopping 150%.\n\n\u201c24H #ETH Network Stats: Price: $183.88 (+0.8%) $ETH On-Chain Volume: $629M (+149.6%) Active Senders: 238K (+13.6%) Active Recipients: 101K (+14.0%),\u201d they noted.\n\n\ud83d\udce2 24H #ETH Network Stats: \ud83d\udcb2 Price: $183.88 (+0.8%)\n\n\ud83d\udcb5 $ETH On-Chain Volume: $629M (+149.6%)\n\n\ud83d\udc48 Active Senders: 238K (+13.6%)\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Active Recipients: 101K (+14.0%) Visit https://t.co/u90eafzR5J for more info \u2014 TokenAnalyst (@thetokenanalyst) October 29, 2019\n\nETH Nears Apex of Bullish Ascending Triangle\n\nWhile looking towards Ethereum\u2019s 4-hour candle chart, the cryptocurrency is currently caught within a bullish ascending triangle that is likely to be resolved in the coming several hours.\n\nJosh Olszewicz, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, noted in a recently posted chart that an upwards break could lead the crypto to just over $200, while a downwards break could lead it reeling to lows of $160.\n\nIn the near-term, how Ethereum responds to the aforementioned triangle that it is currently trading within will likely be largely dependent on Bitcoin, as a break below BTC\u2019s key near-term support levels within the lower-$9,000 region could cause the entire crypto market to cut deep into its recent gains.\n\nFeatured image from Shutterstock.", "description": "Analysts are noting that Ethereum (ETH) may drop as low as $160 if it fails to decisively break above the upper boundary of a bullish ascending triangle.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/shutterstock_661816195-1200x780.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
