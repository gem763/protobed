In Egypt? In Turkey? In Russia? In Saudi Arabia? On the contrary, Trump has gone out of his way to excuse corruption \u2013 and worse \u2013 on the part of all of those nations. Trump praised the Philippines\u2019 Duterte for his war on drugs, though that war has included the extra-judicial killings of thousands. He lauded Egypt\u2019s al-Sisi (president till 2034), overlooking widely-reported human rights abuses. He suggested that we lacked moral standing to criticize Turkish president Erdogan\u2019s handling of a coup attempt. \u201cWhen the world sees how bad the United States is and we start talking about civil liberties, I don\u2019t think we are a very good messenger.\u201d Challenged to justify his kind words for Vladimir Putin, whom the interviewer described as \u201ca killer,\u201d Trump was phlegmatic: \u201cThere are a lot of killers. You think our country\u2019s so innocent?\u201d And when it became undeniable that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman had ordered Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi to be chopped up into small pieces, President Trump noted that the Saudis have promised to buy a lot of American military equipment. (He did not add that they have also spent a pretty penny at Trump properties.)\n\nNo, fighting corruption abroad does not seem to be a priority for this administration.\n\nTrump is the master of projection. It is he who attempts to rig elections (see the canceling of primaries in several states), but he claims to be the victim of rigging. It is he who uses power corruptly and then accuses others of doing so.", "description": "", "authors": ["Mona Charen", "Thebulwark.Com Since-When-Does-Trump-Care-About-Corruption"], "top_image": ""}
