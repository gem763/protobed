On Tuesday, Disney hosted the New York premiere of its latest live-action reimagining, Lady and the Tramp, and the occasion called for a \u201cBella Notte\u201d photo op, complete with a red-checkered table and romantic candle lighting. Theroux, who plays the titular Tramp, brought his rescue pit bull, Kuma, to the premiere, and told ET that \u201cit\u2019s her first premiere\u201d and \u201cher first part in a movie.\u201d Kuma went back to her roots to play Pound Dog #3.\n\nA live-action Lady and the Tramp that leans heavily into the dogs-making-bedroom-eyes-at-each-other aspect of the film and is co-penned by \u201cgodfather of mumblecore\u201d Andrew Bujalski is one of many things in our broken-matrix world that seems like a 30 Rock concept come to life. That being said, the premiere gave us a gorgeous photo op of leads Tessa Thompson and Theroux posing with their canine doubles, Rose and Monte, on the red carpet. Look at how Tessa\u2019s billowing bell bottoms artfully drape, echoing the floof of Rose\u2019s poofy legs. Meanwhile Justin truly looks like he body-swapped with the dog and is terrified to be in a dog-body. Their scruffy hair! Their identically arched bushy eyebrows! Their facial hair! Theroux\u2019s glasses even match that dog\u2019s deeply haunted eyes. It\u2019s The Shaggy D.A. (1972) all over again.\n\nPhoto: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Disney+\n\nLady and the Tramp will be available on streaming when Disney+ launches on November 12. If this classical oil-painting photo of F. Murray Abraham posing with a dog we\u2019ve decided to name F. Furry Abraham isn\u2019t reason enough to watch the movie, nothing is.\n\nPhoto: Noam Galai/Getty Images", "description": "On Tuesday Night, Disney held a premiere for its upcoming Lady and the Tramp live-action remake, available on Disney+ November 12.
