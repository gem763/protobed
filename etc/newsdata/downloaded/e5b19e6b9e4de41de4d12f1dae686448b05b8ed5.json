REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\n\nThe WTO\u2019s dispute settlement body, made up of representatives from its 164 members, cleared Washington to take countermeasures against the European Union and Airbus-producing countries Britain, France, Germany and Spain.\n\nThe authorization was a formality after a WTO arbitrator awarded a record right to retaliate over illegal subsidies this month. It would only have been denied if all WTO members present voted against. The meeting lasted less than 20 minutes.\n\nU.S. trade ambassador Dennis Shea told the meeting that Washington still preferred a negotiated solution.\n\n\u201cBut that can only happen if the EU genuinely terminates the benefits to Airbus from current subsidies and ensures that subsidies to Airbus cannot be revived under another name or another mechanism,\u201d he told the meeting.\n\nThe EU delegation told the meeting that it had \u201cserious concerns\u201d and that U.S. tariff measures were short-sighted.\n\nThe WTO has found that both Airbus and its U.S. rival Boeing (BA.N) received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies in a pair of cases that have run for 15 years. An adjudication in the Boeing case is expected early in 2020.\n\nThe United States has said it will impose 10% tariffs on Airbus planes and 25% duties on a range of products, including French wine, Scottish whiskies and cheese from across the continent.\n\nOn Friday, EU trade chief Cecilia Malmstrom wrote to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging him to start negotiations to find a settlement of the Airbus and Boeing cases, adding that resorting to tariffs was not a solution.\n\n\u201cIt would only inflict damage on businesses and put at risk jobs on both sides of the Atlantic, harm global trade and the broader aviation industry at a sensitive time,\u201d she wrote in a letter seen by Reuters.", "description": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) formally authorized the United States on Monday to impose tariffs on up to $7.5 billion of imports of EU goods after an arbitrator's decision over subsidies to planemaker Airbus .", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440658794&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0OV", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
