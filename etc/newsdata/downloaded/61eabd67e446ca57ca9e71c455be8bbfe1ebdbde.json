Byrne to File Resolution Calling for Joe, Hunter Biden Investigation \u2014 \u2018I Just Want to Know the Facts\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "During Monday\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-AL) announced his plan to file a resolution directing the House Committees on Foreign Affairs, Oversight and Government Reform, and Financial Services to begin investigating former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, over his business dealings on foreign soil as his dad served as vice president.\n\nByrne, a candidate for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, said he will file the legislation on Tuesday because he wants Congress \u201cto get to the bottom\u201d of the Bidens\u2019 shady dealings, adding it would be \u201chypocritical\u201d of Democrats to refuse to investigate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking for a foreign government to investigate him, I want the United States Congress to investigate,\u201d Byrne explained. \u201cIf the name on here was not Hunter Biden \u2013 if it were Donald Trump, Jr. \u2013 these investigations would have already started. I want the United States Congress to get to the bottom of this. What did Hunter Biden do? What did Vice President Biden do? What did all of them know? What connection was there between Vice President Biden\u2019s position and these business dealings that his son got? I think the American people deserve to know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, I just want to know the facts,\u201d he added. \u201cWe seem to investigate everything else that has to do with President Trump. I want to investigate this with regards to Hunter Biden.\u201d\n\nIn a press release announcing the resolution, Byrne criticized House Democrats for turning \u201ca blind eye to the Biden scandal.\u201d\n\nByrne said, \u201cWhile Democrats intensify their partisan scheme to impeach President Trump, they continue to turn a blind eye to the Biden scandal. If the same facts in the Biden case occurred with one of President Trump\u2019s children, Democrats would have already launched a full scale investigation.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe must draw attention to the Democrats\u2019 hypocrisy and demand a full investigation into the Bidens and their sketchy business dealings with China and Ukraine. Instead of wasting time with the witch hunt against President Trump, Congress should demand answers from Joe and Hunter Biden and get to the bottom of all this nonsense.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During Monday's \"Fox & Friends,\" Rep.
