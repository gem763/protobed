And it\u2019s easier for me, as a single man, to say \u201cI don\u2019t like children\u201d because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt.\n\nHundreds of allegations of sexual abuse were made against Savile after his death (Picture: Mark Cuthbert/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\nLouis joins Graham Norton and a host of celebrity guests (Picture: PA)\n\n\u2018How do they know whether I am [a paedophile] or not? How does anybody know whether I am? Nobody knows whether I am or not. I know I\u2019m not.\u2019\n\n\u2018Does it work?\u2019 Louis asked. \u2018It works a treat,\u2019 Savile replied.\n\nTheroux, 49, recently said he was still \u2018haunted\u2019 by his time with Jimmy, saying: \u2018The hallmark of his offending was he was weirdly brazen in his ability to address it and take the position that is completely bizarre.\u2019\n\nThe documentary-maker is currently promoting his autobiography, the brilliantly named Gotta Get Theroux This, and admits that his wife Nancy wasn\u2019t too impressed by the first draft.\n\nHe says on tonight\u2019s show: \u2018I imagined early on that I was writing an edgy sort of book. A professional memoir felt safe as I didn\u2019t have to divulge much about my own psyche, my anxieties and my inner workings. Including my personal life was arrived at somewhat grudgingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Basically, what happened was that after I\u2019d worked on it for a year I showed it to my wife. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s a bit boring!\u201d so I had to sex it up a bit by going behind the scenes. It turned out to be more painful than you would think.\u2019\n\nLouis is joined on the sofa by Renee Zellwegger, Wham! star Andrew Ridgeley, Sir Lenny Henry and Elbow.\n\nThe Graham Norton Show is on tonight at 10.35pm on BBC One.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
