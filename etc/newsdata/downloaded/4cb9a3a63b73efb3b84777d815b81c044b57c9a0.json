We could not allow militants to infiltrate Russia from there.\n\nSupporting \u201crebels\u201d in the Middle East and North Africa, like Washington and its Gulf and European allies has routinely done, has had disastrous effects for global security, Putin pointed out. The invasion of Iraq led to an insurgency that later created Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIL/ISIS), he said, and NATO\u2019s \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d in Libya created a \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d that is still seen today.\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nto RT newsletter to get stories the mainstream media won\u2019t tell you.", "description": "Syria\u2019s internal problems can only be solved once the country is free of terrorists, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said, adding that Moscow is supporting Damascus to ensure that extremists never reach Russia\u2019s borders.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5da1d19885f54003e7050e46.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
