And my numbers went down to the equivalent of a normal human being who does not have pancreatic cancer. So we were all very optimistic. And they said, \u2018Good, we\u2019re gonna stop chemo, we\u2019ll start you on immunotherapy,'\u201d he said before, \u201cI lost about 12 pounds in a week. And my numbers went sky high, much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. So, the doctors have decided that I have to undergo chemo again and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nTrebek talked about how cancer has taken a toll on his body saying sometimes it\u2019s \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d and other times \u201cfatigue.\u201d\n\n\u201cCancer is mysterious in more ways than one,\u201d he said\u2026\n\n\u201cWhen it happened early on I was down on myself,\u201d he told \u201cGMA.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how fallible each of us is in his or her own way \u2026 I talk to the audience sometimes and I get teary eyed for no reason.
