The crew reportedly left a van at the base that had an expired security pass. The discovery of the sketchy van sent the base into crisis mode, prompting the evacuation of an estimated 400 people while sniffer dogs and bomb squads combed the area.\n\nLuckily, the van did not contain any pyrotechnics or other hazardous materials.\n\n\u201cA 300-meter cordon was put in place while it was assessed by bomb disposal teams. It is an unbelievable blunder to have caused such a massive security risk,\u201d a source familiar with the incident told the Sun.\n\nAccording to media reports, the mishap is unlikely to change the RAF\u2019s policy regarding film crews using their facilities, as such arrangements bring in huge amounts of cash.\n\nAlso on rt.com Bong scare?
