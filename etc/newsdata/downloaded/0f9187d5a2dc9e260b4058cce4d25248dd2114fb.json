Pei and Chinese-French artist Zao Wou-Ki met in Paris in 1951, after Pei saw one of Zao\u2019s paintings at the Pierre Loeb gallery and asked the gallerist for an introduction to the artist.\n\n\u201cThey immediately became friends,\u201d says Jean-Olivier Despr\u00e9s, director of Gagosian gallery in Paris. \u201cThey remained friends the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nThe friendship, and artistic partnership, between Pei, the Pritzker prize-winning architect who died in May at age 102, and Zao, who died at age 93 in 2013, is being celebrated at Gagosian in New York at an exhibition of Zao\u2019s ink works that opened this week and runs through Oct. 26.\n\nZao Wou Ki's 'Sans titre,' 2006, India ink on paper mounted on canvas 106 3/4 x 83 7/8 in \u00a9 2019 Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York / ProLitteris, Zurich Courtesy Gagosian\n\nZao, born in Beijing in 1920, is more known for his dynamic, oil-painted abstracts, full of color and light. Last October, Zao\u2019s Juin-Octobre 1985, a mammoth triptych spanning more than 9-feet by 32-feet, realized HK$510.4 million (US$65.2 million) at Sotheby\u2019s in Hong Kong.\n\nAt Pei\u2019s behest, Zao created his first ink-on-paper works in a large format as a 1982 commission for the architect\u2019s Fragrant Hill Hotel in Beijing, China. As ink-on-paper works, the pieces evoke Zao\u2019s roots in the East, though expressed through the abstract and Modernist style Zao had been practicing in Europe.\n\n\u201cThe language the artist conveys with these specific works is very musical, with an intense rhythm and Eastern aesthetic,\u201d Despr\u00e9s says.\n\nWhile Pei influenced Zao by encouraging him to return to ink, the reverse is also true, as Zao traveled to Egypt with Pei \u201cto explore the pyramids for the architect\u2019s project at the Louvre in Paris,\u201d Despr\u00e9s says. \u201cThey exchanged ideas about art, culture, and its influence.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition at Gagosian\u2019s Madison Avenue gallery includes works that are privately owned, as well as works for sale, although the gallery doesn\u2019t comment on prices.\n\nThe exhibited pieces include two small works on paper from 1979 and 1980, which are prototypes for the Fragrant Hill Hotel project. \u201cThere are also seven large works on paper mounted on canvas from the same series, all made from India ink,\u201d Despr\u00e9s says.\n\nThe series, representing the largest works Zao created in ink, was made in 2006 and was the \u201cvery last\u201d series the artist completed, he says.", "description": "The New York gallery is featuring ink-on-paper works by the Chinese-French painter best known for his abstracts", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-106290/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
