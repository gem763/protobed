And there is no public database of disciplined police officers.\n\nTo create the first, journalists at USA TODAY and its affiliated newspapers across the country \u2013 and media partners including the Invisible Institute in Chicago \u2013 gathered records from thousands of state agencies, prosecutors and local police departments.\n\nStarting with lists of officers who lost their law enforcement certification in 44 states, we are making those records available here.\n\nHelp us investigate\n\nThis project is a broad collaborative effort of journalists across the country. You can help.\n\nAre you a journalist, a police or government official or a resident who has acquired police discipline or accountability records in your state or city? We want to see those.\n\nWe also want to hear from people with information about the conduct of a law enforcement officer or agency that you believe we should investigate.\n\nIf you submit public records, our nationwide network of journalists will first work to validate the records' authenticity and work to add them here.\n\nShare your stories of police misconduct with us We want to hear from you if you believe you\u2019ve encountered misconduct by a law enforcement officer or agency. You can send tips and records about an officer or agency to policetips@usatoday.com. Email Us Need anonymity or security? Send records and tips to us via SecureDrop.\n\nContributors to this project\n\nMore than 100 newsrooms across the country contributed to the gathering of public records for this project, led by USA TODAY and its 100-plus affiliated local newsrooms across the United States.\n\nAlso contributing substantially to the ongoing records-gathering and release is the Invisible Institute, a nonprofit journalism organization in Chicago that focuses on delving into issues around policing tactics and criminal justice.\n\nIf you are a journalist who wants to contribute records to this project or join us in requesting public records from police agencies across the country, please reach out to John Kelly at jkelly@usatoday.com.\n\nTarnished Brass: Fired for a felony, again for perjury.
