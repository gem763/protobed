REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo\n\nSince the U.S. tech company unveiled its plans in June, its proposed cryptocurrency has met with regulatory and political scepticism, with France and Germany pledging to block Libra from operating in Europe.\n\n\u201cThe goal is still to launch Libra next year,\u201d Facebook\u2019s David Marcus told NZZ in an interview published on Friday. \u201cUntil then, we\u2019ll need to address all questions adequately, create a suitable regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nThe social media giant\u2019s project, announced as it expands into e-commerce, is a high-profile attempt to drag cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.\n\nLibra will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and overseen by a 28-member organisation.\n\nThe structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.\n\nMarcus said it was unlikely Libra coins would become a means of payment for regular real-world transactions in countries like Switzerland, Germany or France, but would rather be used for cross-border payments or for settling very small sums.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely in any case the people will pay for an espresso in Switzerland, Germany or France with Libra in the future,\u201d he said. Initially, he added, he expected user acceptance to be a bigger problem than regulatory issues.\n\nAuthorities\u2019 concerns have centered on the project\u2019s potential to destabilise the global financial system, interfere with sovereign monetary policy and harm privacy as well as its potential for use in money laundering.\n\nMarcus said he did not believe the project would interfere with monetary policy, since it would not be creating any new money and would not influence interest rates or yields.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Calibra digital wallet, which will allow consumers and vendors to hold and transact the digital currency, would be made available everywhere that it is able to meet regulatory requirements, Marcus said.\n\nFacebook would not be able to access data from its newly created subsidiary Calibra, he added.", "description": "Facebook still aims to launch its Libra digital currency next year, its executive overseeing the project told Swiss newspaper NZZ, as the company presses ahead despite authorities around the world pouring cold water on the plans.", "authors": ["Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432040182&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J1NL", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
