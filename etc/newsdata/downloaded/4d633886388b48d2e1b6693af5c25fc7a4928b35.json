The clip doesn\u2019t note exactly what it is that Kardashian learned, but based on coverage of the memoir when it was released, it\u2019s likely that the event in question was this dramatic run-in outside a SoulCycle studio in August 2015. Odom alleged in the memoir that Kris Jenner orchestrated the entire event.\n\nOdom wrote in the memoir that Jenner called that August to tell him that her daughter \u201cwanted to speak to me in person the next day in LA.\u201d\n\nWhile on a drug binge, Odom went to Los Angeles to see his then-wife.\n\n\u201cKris said Khloe would be at SoulCycle in Beverly Hills at 6 AM, and she was right on time,\u201d wrote the basketball star.\n\nKardashian was \u201cstunned\u201d at his presence as the unhappy duo\u2019s reunion was inundated by paparazzi.\n\n\u201cIt had to be Kris. She must have called the paparazzi and arranged for them to be there, knowing Khlo\u00e9 would be caught off guard and react accordingly. Now here\u2019s the kicker \u2014 and this will show you how devious Kris Jenner is \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 had no idea I was going to be there. She was frightened and jittery. From the outset it looked like I was ambushing her while she walked to her workout. We were on bad terms and she didn\u2019t want me there. It all began to make sense,\u201d Odom wrote.\n\n\u201cThe cameras caught the entire encounter on tape,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere had been a sliver of hope for us to reconcile. I wanted to get back together. Kris knew this was my last chance, but she didn\u2019t want a drug addict in the family. It wasn\u2019t good for business. Any chance I had left with Khlo\u00e9 exploded on the spot.\u201d\n\nGiven that this revelation is pretty explosive \u2015 and hella shady on Jenner\u2019s part \u2015 it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it\u2019s what set Kardashian off.\n\nIn another part of the clip for next week\u2019s episode, Scott Disick is heard telling Kardashian about her mom: \u201cShe literally thinks you\u2019re gonna, like, come for her.\u201d Without missing a beat, the Good American founder says, \u201cGuess what? I am.\u201d\n\nYikes. You\u2019d think after all these years we\u2019d be better at keeping up with these wild Kardashians and yet ... we\u2019ll still be tuning in on Sunday to see for sure what sparked the drama this time.", "description": "Odom's memoir alleged that the KarJenner matriarch orchestrated a run-in as an attempt to end the couple\u2019s marriage.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dadf744210000ba1e34a99c.png?cache=4m8oznxslp&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
