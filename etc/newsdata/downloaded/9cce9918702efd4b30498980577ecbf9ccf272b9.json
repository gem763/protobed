They also know that they stand a much better chance of getting a deal with Mr Trump than with any other US president.\n\n\"Both sides know that the clock is ticking, with Trump up for another presidential bid next year, and the domestic political turmoil Trump is in now,\" analyst Minyoung Lee of NK News told the BBC.\n\nWhat to expect?\n\nPredicting talks between the US and North Korea is notoriously difficult, says Andray Abrahamian, Senior Adjunct Fellow at the Pacific Forum.\n\n\"We're trying, with limited information, to assess the prospects for talks between a rather esoteric and now embattled Trump Administration and North Korea, the most opaque country in the world,\" he says.\n\nAfter all, the last top-level talks in Hanoi surprised everyone when they suddenly fell apart. Since then there has only been a brief Trump-Kim meeting at the inter-Korean border in June.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump and Mr Kim briefly met on 30 June, but talks are yet to resume\n\nHanoi failed because North Korea wanted step-by-step sanctions relief while the US expected major denuclearisation steps before agreeing to ease sanctions.\n\n\"These talks are happening because there were clear signals from the US that it would be willing to discuss a phase-by-phase approach,\" Ms Lee explains.\n\nThis is what North Korea has consistently called for this past year.\n\nBut Pyongyang has to be careful not to overestimate how badly the Trump administration needs a deal.\n\nIf North Korea plays hardball and threatens to walk away from a deal, \"this window of opportunity might close, and close forever,\" Mr Abrahamian explains.\n\n\"North Korea needs to consider that President Trump could be gone or crippled sooner than they had planned for. Time is short.\"\n\nAnother Trump-Kim Summit?\n\nMost observers see the fresh talks as an opening move to another Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\"I think that both Kim and Trump have their eye on another meeting with pageantry, but also some substance,\" Mr Abrahamian says.\n\n\"It will have to be to do a deal that will be the entry point into a peace and denuclearisation process. Then the hard work begins, of course.\"\n\nThe two have held two summits so far. The first one in Singapore in 2018 resulted in a vague denuclearisation agreement which led to little concrete results.\n\nThe second summit in Hanoi ended early without any agreement.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on\n\nIf there was to be another summit, it would be without ousted National Security Advisor John Bolton, whose tough stance against North Korea are thought to have been a major irritation to Pyongyang.\n\n\"The US could settle for what North Korea offered in Hanoi - dismantlement of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor with US inspectors on hand,\" Ms Lee expects.\n\n\"In return, North Korea likely will demand further scaling down of, or even complete termination of, all US-South Korea joint military exercises, and lifting of key sanctions.\"\n\nReports suggest that, in the upcoming talks, the US may offer a suspension of UN sanctions on North Korean textile and coal exports for 36 months. In return, it wants the closure of the Yongbyon nuclear facility, and the end of uranium enrichment.\n\nThis is \"less than the all-or-nothing approach Washington has taken so far\", Vox reports.\n\nDidn't North Korea just test a missile?\n\nJust this Thursday, North Korea confirmed it test-fired a new type of a ballistic missile, a significant escalation from the short-range tests it has conducted since May.\n\nThe missile - able to carry a nuclear weapon - was the North's 11th test this year. Fired from a platform at sea, it appears to be capable of being launched from a submarine.\n\nImage copyright KCNA via REUTERS Image caption A picture released by North Korea's news agency said to be of the missile\n\nThe new test was \"a grave moment for North East Asian regional security - and a reminder of what has been lost over nearly two years of all-show-no-substance diplomacy,\" Ankit Panda, adjunct senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, told the BBC after the launch.\n\nWhile it might have been a way to build up pressure ahead of the talks, Pyongyang is walking a tight line. The Trump administration was prepared to ignore earlier tests as they had all been short-range missiles.\n\nThis one, though, was longer and can be launched from a submarine - and hence will be much harder to brush off by the US.", "description": "The talks in Sweden aim to break months of stalemate but come days after a new missile test by the North.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/001F/production/_109113000_mediaitem109112999.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
