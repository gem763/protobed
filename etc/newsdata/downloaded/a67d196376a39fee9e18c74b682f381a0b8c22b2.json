Each faces charges of money laundering and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.\n\nMartin Fox, the president of a private tennis club in Houston, also agreed to plead guilty by November 20 in a deal that prosecutors announced Monday. He is charged with racketeering.\n\nAuthorities say Fox brokered bribes to help wealthy parents cheat on their children's college entrance exams at a Houston testing site. He's also accused of arranging bribes to get two students admitted to the University of San Diego as recruited athletes, and one student to the University of Texas.

AP\n\nFifteen other parents previously pleaded guilty as part of plea agreements. Prosecutors agreed to request lighter sentences for those parents, since they took responsibility earlier. But the four new parents had no such deals, and they face additional charges of money laundering that could bring weightier sentences.\n\nOut of 10 parents sentenced so far, nine have been dealt prison time, with terms ranging from two weeks to five months. Fifteen other parents are fighting the charges. Their trials are expected to begin in 2020.\n\nHodge, of Laguna Beach, California, was accused of paying more than $500,000 in bribes to get two of his children into the University of Southern California.

Neither played on those sports teams.\n\nHodge, a former CEO of the Pacific Investment Management Company, is scheduled to be sentenced in January 2020. He apologized in a statement Monday, saying he takes full responsibility for his conduct.\n\n\"I have always prided myself on leading by example, and I am ashamed of the decisions I made. I acted out of love for my children, but I know that this explanation for my actions is not an excuse,\" Hodge said in a statement. \"I also want to apologize to the deserving college students who may have been adversely impacted by this process.\"\n\nFelicity Huffman's sentence \"set the floor\" in college admissions scandal, lawyer says\n\nJanavs, of Newport Coast, California, is accused of paying $400,000 to get her son admitted to Georgetown University as a fake tennis recruit in 2017.
