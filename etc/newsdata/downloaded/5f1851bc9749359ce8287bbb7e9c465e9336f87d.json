Pakistan had reached number one in the Twenty20 rankings under Sarfaraz, winning 11 series along the way.\n\nPakistan will play three Twenty20 internationals in Australia in November ahead of two Test matches.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Top-order batsman Azhar Ali has been named as Test captain while Babar Azam has been given the charge to lead the T20 side.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Sarfraz-Ahmed-Social.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
