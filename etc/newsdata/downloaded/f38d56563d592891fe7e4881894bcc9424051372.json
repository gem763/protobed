Language radicalises, after all. And Jo Cox had been murdered by a far right nationalist called Thomas Mair, at the height of the EU referendum campaign. At his trial, he called her a \u201ccollaborator\u201d and a \u201ctraitor\u201d to white people.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe day before her death, her children and her husband had travelled up the Thames by speedboat, waving an \u201cIn\u201d banner in the face of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit flotilla.\n\nShe had been murdered in the act of fighting to keep Britain in the European Union.\n\nAnd here was the prime minister, recalled to parliament to give account for his actions having been declared unlawful by the Supreme Court, having the unimaginable temerity to imagine the way to atone for Jo Cox\u2019s murder would be in delivering the outcome she campaigned to prevent.\n\nThere were gasps in the chamber. They are words that will surely haunt him forever.\n\nThey came after an even more grim exchange with Labour's Paula Sheriff, a former friend of Jo Cox's who had raised the \"death threats and the abuse that we as MPs are subjected to every day\" and that the language of \"surrender and betrayal and traitors\" was causing serious harm.\n\nHe told her he had \u201cnever heard so much humbug in my life.\u201d\n\nTwo hours earlier, the prime minister\u2019s statement had got off to a predictably abysmal start.\n\nFour weeks ago, Boris Johnson announced he would be proroguing parliament. He called the TV cameras into Downing Street and told them it had absolutely nothing at all to do with Brexit. It was to allow for a Queen\u2019s Speech, so he could get on with his \u201cexciting domestic agenda.\u201d\n\nAnd lo, on Tuesday, the Supreme Court declared, unanimously, that such a claim could not possibly be true.\n\nIt declared his prorogation to be unlawful and sent the prime minister back to the House of Commons.\n\nHe had been compelled to give a statement on the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict. It began like this.\n\n\u201cWith your permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a statement on yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court verdict and the way forward for this paralysed Parliament.\n\n\u201cThree years ago, more people voted to leave the European Union than have ever voted for any party or proposition in our history.\u201d\n\nHe spoke for six minutes on the subject of Brexit, before the Supreme Court judgement was even mentioned.\n\n\u201cI think the Court was wrong to pronounce on what is essentially a political question at a time of great national controversy,\u201d he said.\n\nFour weeks ago, prorogation had had nothing to do with Brexit. He had been found to have not been telling the truth, and now here he was, disagreeing with the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict, while speaking for six straight minutes about why it had absolutely everything to do with Brexit.\n\nIt was such an absurd lie that there was almost an honesty to it. To make so clear that, of course, prorogation had been about Brexit all along, while simultaneously telling the Supreme Court it was wrong. This was a lie so ridiculous it almost fell like he was coming clean\n\nIf someone daubs the word LIAR across their forehead in black felt tip, can they really, in good faith, be accused of not telling the truth?\n\nThe short statement contained most of the traditional grim realities. Johnson has been prime minister for two months now. In that time, he has not uttered a word about how Brexit will offer anything of any value to the country.\n\nIt is only some thing to be got out of the way. We want to \u201cget Brexit done.\u201d He said it, five separate times, each time being a lie all of its own. He knows the real Brexit negotiations haven\u2019t even started yet. Brexit will not be \u201cdone\u201d for a decade, at best.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be a fantastic thing if the word Brexit was never heard in 2020,\u201d he said at one point. What a joke, except that we are all the punchline.\n\nHe spoke for around a quarter of an hour. Less than ten seconds was spent on the Supreme Court and its verdict. The rest of it was spent demanding Jeremy Corbyn give him the election he wants on the date he wants, that will allow him to fight an election promising a deal with the EU, and then, inevitably take the country out of the EU without one, ruining people\u2019s lives and livelihoods.\n\nBut Jeremy Corbyn doesn\u2019t trust him. Jeremy Corbyn thinks he is lying. So Jeremy Corbyn isn\u2019t going to give him the election he wants, on the date he wants, to get on with the con job he is so desperate to deliver.\n\nAnd Boris Johnson has no way to get it, beyond screaming gibberish about the Surrender Act and about Jeremy Corbyn being a chicken and being too scared to have an election and all the rest of the pointless noise that can\u2019t get him out of the hole that he has accidentally dug for himself, by not being a fraction as clever as he thought he was.\n\nThe only way out of this particular aspect of the impasse would be for Jeremy Corbyn to trust him. It is not, shall we say, immediately clear, how Boris Johnson imagines he win people\u2019s t to that place by lying his way out of old lies with new ones.", "description": "\u201cThe best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox\u00a0would be, I think, to get Brexit done.\u201d Those words left the prime minister\u2019s lips in the House of Commons at just gone 8.30pm, on the day it had been recalled to atone for his dishonesty.", "authors": ["Tom Peck"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/25/20/point1-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
