Beginning Tuesday, people who are new to Facebook, or previously had the tag suggestions setting available, will instead get the face recognition setting, which they can turn on. It will be off by default.\n\nPeople who had the tag suggestions setting turned off will see a notice about face recognition and a button to turn it on or keep it off.\n\nFacebook was sued in Illinois over the tag suggestion feature and a federal appeals court has ruled the lawsuit can proceed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Facebook says it is ending its practice of using face recognition software to identify users' friends in uploaded photos and automatically suggesting they \"tag\" them.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
