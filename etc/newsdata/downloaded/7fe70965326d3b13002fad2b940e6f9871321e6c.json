The last time I went to LA to film my show, I packed 11 suitcases.\n\n\"Every country I went to I would leave a suitcase there and give it to the local charity.\n\n\"I don't know why I do it. I always panic when I don't have choice. When I go away I like to dress to the way I'm feeling.\n\n(Image: WENN)\n\n\"Going on holiday and having to pre-pick my clothes before I go. I just don't enjoy the experience. I'm a free spirit.\"\n\nGemma went in to admit her luggage ends up costing her at least \u00a3300-per-trip in excess luggage fees - but she always tries to get out of paying.\n\nShe added: \"Honestly every time I fly, it's like \u00a3300 excess and I think 'oh no not again'.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n\"I try and sweet talk them like 'if you ever need anything from me, contact my shop.\n\n\"And they are like 'no sorry it's \u00a3300' and I get there I still don't know what to wear every day.\n\n\"I don't follow fashion. I just wear what I want to wear.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
