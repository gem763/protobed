Their cover is then blown,\" Fox told Insider. \"A lot of the training involves being very non-alerting, pretty much just very boring so that we aren't drawing attention to ourselves.\"\n\nShe added that most of what is seen in spy movies, like downplaying human intelligence in favor of hyping the paramilitary aspect or inaccurately portraying female characters and the meaningful contributions they make to this type of work, is wildly off the mark.\n\nCommenting on her pride in seeing four women in the top positions at the CIA, she said, \"I hope that the screen portrayals that we see going forward have a more substantive reflection of women's contributions to national security.\"\n\n\"They are really so important,\" she added.\n\nFox spent her time in the CIA preventing weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands, working behind the scenes to address terrifying threats she says would \"overwhelm\" the average American if they knew.\n\nHer new book detailing some of her training and her experiences and offering a peak behind the curtain of CIA operations is out Tuesday.", "description": "Training to be a CIA spy is incredibly intense, and even when you leave the service, some things stick with you for life.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da60b33cc4a0a10721aabc5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
