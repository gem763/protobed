Sit down into your pli\u00e9 position. Shoulders over hips, bottom in. Once in the hold, lift and lower your heels. Pulse for 20 at a quick pace, then do five slow and controlled. Rest. Repeat alternating heel lifts, left then right, doing 20 on each side. Rest. On your last set, lift and lower as many as you can for 30 seconds. Rest. Repeat the combo from the beginning.\n\nCelebrity personal trainer Nadya Fairweather recommends this wide pli\u00e9 heel lifts exercise to tone your calves\n\nWHAT TO EAT\n\nTo build strong, defined calf muscles, nutritionist Shona Wilkinson (shonawilkinson.com) recommends the following foods.\n\nAnyone for a bison burger? Bison gives us a really high dose of protein, which is vital for firm calves \u2014 yet it contains half the fat of beef. Give it a go!\n\nEat an omelette. Eggs are a great source of protein for strong muscles. But don\u2019t opt for an egg white omelette, make sure you get the yolk as well, for even more nutritional intake.\n\nGrilled chicken is a great choice for a hit of protein without the fat of red meat. Grill a batch and keep them in the fridge for a handy snack.\n\nWHAT TO WEAR", "description": "Personal trainer Nadya Fairweather advises trying wide pli\u00e9 heel lifts to tone calves.
