Unlike cows or pigs, insects can be bred in significant numbers without taking up large amounts of land, water or feed.\n\nInsects are also nutritious, containing essential proteins, fats, minerals and amino acids. Bugs for consumption are typically bred in large-scale factory conditions.\n\nIn the new YouGov poll of 2,093 adults, nearly two in five (37%) of respondents said they thought the consumption of insects would increase in the next 10 years, rising to nearly half (48%) among the 18-24-year-old age group.\n\nMark Buckingham, chair of the ABC, said: \u201cWe are delighted to see UK consumers embrace innovation as the future of farming. Using cutting-edge technology and growing techniques will enable the UK to deal with the serious challenges of keeping our farmers competitive, maintaining a safe, affordable food supply, and protecting our natural environment.\u201d\n\nThe global edible insect market is set to exceed $520m (\u00a3430m) by 2023, according to recent research. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says at least 2 billion people regularly consume insects. But while more than 1,000 species are eaten around the world, they hardly feature in the diets of many rich nations.\n\nInsects tipped to rival sushi as fashionable food of the future Read more\n\nIn the UK, crickets and other insects have so far been predominantly limited to quirky pop-ups or sales through online outlets, while they also feature on a few restaurant menus.\n\nLast November, Sainsbury\u2019s became the first major UK grocer to stock edible crickets, selling the roasted insects as snacks in small bags from the UK brand Eat Grub in 250 of its stores.\n\nHelen Browning, chief executive of the organic food and farming group the Soil Association, said: \u201cInsects can be used to convert waste food very efficiently and there are a few large \u2018insect farms\u2019 now established across the world, targeted at animal and fish diets.\n\n\u201cThere is clearly interest in insects for humans too, but how quickly these markets will develop remains to be seen. For many people in the UK, there is a bit of a \u2018yuck\u2019 factor, though of course in many cultures they are a normal part of the diet.\u201d", "description": "Research finds belief that scoffing crickets or worm burgers will be commonplace", "authors": ["Rebecca Smithers"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dae5feb3af88787717c64bc55ae24ed877eedce8/0_0_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ead725fba74566ec76b520598f5f22aa"}
