finally praises Donald Trump over Baghdadi raid:", "language": "en", "text": "Russia today gave Donald Trump a muted round of applause for his mission against Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but insisted that the ISIS leader's death had yet to be confirmed.\n\nVladimir Putin's spokesman said Trump would have made a 'serious contribution' to fighting ISIS if Baghdadi is indeed dead.\n\n'If this information is confirmed we can talk about a serious contribution by the President of the United States to the fight against international terrorism,' he said.\n\nTurkey and Saudi Arabia today hailed Baghdadi's death but European nations have warned that the fight against ISIS is not yet over.\n\nKeeping quiet: A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured in Moscow today) refused to say whether the Kremlin had advance knowledge of the Baghdadi raid\n\nRussia today refused to say whether it had known in advance about the U.S. operation, which hit its target when Baghdadi blew himself up with an explosive vest.\n\nThe Russian military had spotted American planes and drones in Syria on Saturday night, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday.\n\nBut he declined to say whether Russia knew what was happening or had offered any assistance.\n\nHowever, the Kremlin would see Baghdadi's death as a welcome development if it is confirmed, Peskov said.\n\nTrump had voiced his thanks to Russia during his White House statement on Sunday morning.\n\n'This raid was impeccable, and could only have taken place with the acknowledgement and help of certain other nations and people,' Trump said.\n\n'I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq,' he said without further explanation.\n\nRussia's defence ministry raised doubts about the raid yesterday, referring sarcastically to Baghdadi's 'umpteenth' death after numerous reports of his demise in recent years.\n\nRussian officials claimed last night that there were no recorded airstrikes in the area where Baghdadi died.\n\nThey also suggested that Baghdadi was unlikely to be in a part of Syria controlled either by the Syrian government or an al-Qaeda affiliate which is a rival to ISIS.\n\nWashington said it had confirmed Baghdadi's death using DNA samples matched to an Iraqi prison where the ISIS leader was held in 2004.\n\nBaghdadi had been detained in Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\nGratitude: President Donald Trump during his statement at the White House yesterday, during which he thanked Russia for unspecified help in the Baghdadi raid\n\nHe was held at Camp Bucca, a notorious militant breeding ground which housed tens of thousands of Iraqi insurgents.\n\nWhile there, his DNA and fingerprints were taken and it was that evidence which allowed Trump to confirm Baghdadi's death yesterday morning.\n\nThe Americans spent two hours in the compound and took a cache of 'highly sensitive material and information' which could reveal future ISIS plans.\n\nUnlike the Kremlin, the Russian defence ministry also played down Baghdadi's importance, saying his death would have 'no operational significance'.\n\nThe U.S. has frequently been at odds with Moscow over Syria, whose leader Bashar al-Assad is a close ally of Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe raid against Baghdadi comes shortly after U.S. troops pulled out of northern Syria, clearing the way for Russia to become the key power-broker in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey today acknowledged it had taken part in the operation and boasted of 'intense' co-ordination with U.S. forces.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Baghdadi's death a 'turning point in our joint fight against terrorism'.\n\n'Our military and intelligence units were in contact with their American counterparts on this issue and they coordinated,' a spokesman said.\n\n'Especially...the night when the operation was conducted, we can say there was intense diplomacy between our military authorities.\n\nEliminated: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured in a propaganda video in April this year) died at a Syrian compound during a raid by U.S. special forces\n\n'A terrorist organization nesting in Syria, near our border, or any other region, is not something we can accept.'\n\nSaudi Arabia today praised the U.S. operation and said Baghdadi had 'distorted' the reputation of Islam.\n\n'The kingdom appreciates the U.S. administration's efforts to pursue members of this terrorist organisation that distorted the real image of Islam... and committed atrocities and crimes,' a foreign ministry official said.\n\nIn Berlin, the German government said its thoughts were with the many victims of ISIS atrocities carried out in Baghdadi's name.\n\nSpokesman Steffen Seibert said today that Baghdadi 'can't issue murderous orders any more' but warned: 'This doesn't mean that the fight against ISIS is over'.\n\nFrance's interior minister yesterday called for increased vigilance in a country which has already been the victim of multiple ISIS attacks.\n\n'The possible intensification of jihadist propaganda following this death, which could possibly call for acts of vengeance, requires the most extreme vigilance,' said Christophe Castaner.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also urged caution after the death of the 48-year-old terrorist leader.\n\n'Al-Baghdadi's death is a hard blow against Islamic State, but it is just a stage,' Macron said.\n\nBaghdadi's remains were taken from the compound and will be buried at sea in the same way as Osama bin Laden's body in 2011.\n\nOnce the U.S. troops had finished, they obliterated Baghdadi's compound in order to prevent it becoming a shrine, an official told Newsweek.\n\nWhile Baghdadi's death may leave ISIS divided and rudderless, there are fears that his followers will now carry out revenge attacks against the West.", "description": "A spokesman for Russian leader Vladimir Putin (pictured) said the Kremlin had
