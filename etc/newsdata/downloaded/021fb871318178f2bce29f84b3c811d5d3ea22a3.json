He sought the information after state officials revoked the clinic\u2019s license in June, citing concerns over multiple \u201cfailed abortions,\u201d which required additional procedures, and a patient who suffered life-threatening complications.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nState health officials are not subject to medical privacy laws, and Williams has legal access to Planned Parenthood abortion reports that contain information about menstrual cycles, said Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, director of state media campaigns for Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Nonetheless, the revelation has alarmed lawyers, women\u2019s health experts and abortion rights activists.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Crystal Quade, minority leader in the Missouri House of Representatives, called on Republican Gov. Mike Parson to \u201cimmediately investigate whether patient privacy was compromised or laws broken and determine if this is a person who Missourians can be comfortable having in position of public trust.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the politics of the state and the passing of an egregious abortion ban bill, I don\u2019t have a lot of hope that the governor is going to make this a priority,\u201d Quade said in an interview.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe governor\u2019s office and the Missouri health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nParson signed a restrictive law earlier this year that banned abortions after the eighth week of pregnancy, which was blocked by a federal court.\n\nThe tracking of women\u2019s periods recalls China\u2019s practice when it limited families to one child to control population growth, said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University Langone Health.\n\nThe Chinese government kept details about women\u2019s contraceptive use and whether people were sterilized, pregnant, married or single. \u201cWhen a government official monitors your reproductive behavior, you are perilously close to replicating totalitarian regime,\u201d Caplan said.\n\nAD\n\nWomen\u2019s health experts emphasized that abortion is a safe medical procedure and said a follow-up appointment after an abortion does not necessarily indicate that an abortion failed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe very idea of keeping a government spreadsheet of patients\u2019 menstrual cycles seems more in line with the plans of a deranged stalker than with the program of the highest state health official in Missouri,\u201d Cornell Law professor Sherry Colb emailed in response to a reporter\u2019s questions.\n\nThis is not the first time Williams\u2019s actions have come under fire by reproductive health advocates. In June, Missouri ended a mandate that patients getting abortions have pelvic exams at least three days prior, which required them to undergo multiple invasive exams just days apart.\n\nAD\n\nReproaction, an abortion and reproductive rights advocacy group, said it is collecting signatures calling on Williams to resign. It collected 2,400 after Williams implemented the rule requiring more pelvic exams, said Pamela Merritt, the group\u2019s co-founder and co-director.\n\nAD\n\nMissouri is one of several states to pass highly restrictive abortion laws that would all but outlaw abortion. The goal is to send cases to the U.S. Supreme Court that might lead a conservative majority to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion. All of the bans have been blocked by federal courts.\n\nAriana Eunjung Cha contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "The state\u2019s health director, who is also an OB/GYN, said the aim was to identify failed abortions.", "authors": ["Yasmeen Abutaleb", "National Reporter Focusing On Health Policy", "Emily Wax-Thibodeaux", "National Reporter Covering Breaking News", "Social Movements."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/igfEvnLpiviX6eNr6W96jGR6ogc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NN4QBGX3MII6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
