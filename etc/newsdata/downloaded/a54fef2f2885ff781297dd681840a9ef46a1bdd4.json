A couple's 20-year long fairy tale-worthy romance story which all revolves around a $1 bill has been making people tear up on Reddit (stock image)\n\nBack in junior high, the user first came across his spouse.\n\nHe wrote, 'I liked a girl and flirted with her quite a bit. One time, during a band trip, we stopped at a gas station and she bought me a pack of gum. I tried to pay her back $1 but she refused so, I slipped the $1 in her pocket.'\n\nThe woman in question then slipped the dollar right back into his pocket, thus starting the back-and-forth situation that would become their cherished tradition.\n\n'We found silly ways to give it back and forth. I mailed it to her house. She stuffed it in a gum wrapper and offered me a piece,' he recalled.\n\nBy this stage, he had plucked up the courage to ask her out. And how else to do so but by writing it on the note. Of course, she said yes - also writing so on the bill.\n\nFour years later, the school sweethearts were still going steady.\n\nMemory lane: U.S.-based male user JFreak7 shared the adorable story which went down a treat on the thread\n\nIt's priceless! The man shared an image of the now-famous dollar bill which holds the narrative to their whole 20-year relationship\n\n'Four years later... on our anniversary, I wrote \"Will you marry me\" on the bottom of the dollar.\n\nThe couple have now been married for 15 years and are parents to three kids.\n\nNaturally, they still have the dollar stored away for safe keeping. But, to the delight of commentors on the thread, he included a photo of the sentimental keepsake for good measure.\n\nTheir romantic story, which seemed like something straight out of a movie, went down a treat on the thread.\n\n'That dollar really paid off. Wow,' said one user.\n\n'Made me cry dude, good on you,' said another.\n\n'I can't even get a text back and you got a whole dollar back,' someone else joked.\n\nReactions: The story had melted even the stoniest of hearts on the thread\n\nIt wasn't the only sweet and sentimental tale on the thread either.\n\nOne woman recalled an intimate family moment involving her great-grandma.\n\n'My great-grandma used to give all of her great-grandchildren a dollar every time she saw us. It was a sweet gesture, and all of us great grandchildren would love seeing her and enjoying the free money.\n\n'She's recently been moved to a nursing home due to the risk of falling because her body is extremely weak (she's 95). I moved in with my boyfriend in August and went through my things while I packed.\n\n'I found, concealed in a child's bible, one dollar wrapped in a note which read: \"Dear baby smileaway, I can't wait until you're born! Here's your first dollar, make sure mommy keeps it. I love you very much!\"\n\n'A few weeks later, my mom, sisters and I went to visit her in the home, as my mom is her primary caretaker. I pulled the dollar from my pocket and read the note aloud. My great grandma's eyes lit up and she beamed. \"Oh wow, look at that!\" , she said. \"I'm glad mommy didn't spend it all!\"\n\nConcluding her memory, the woman poignantly noted that the moment was 'pretty priceless'.", "description": "A couple's love story has gone viral after it was shared on Reddit.
