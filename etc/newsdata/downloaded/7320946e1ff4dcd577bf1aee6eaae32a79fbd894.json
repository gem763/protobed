Many wore masks in open defiance of a government ban on facial coverings meant as a deterrent to protesters, whose four-month-old democratic rebellion has thrown the semi-autonomous enclave into crisis and caused consternation among China\u2019s top leadership.\n\nTerritory-wide SMS alerts from the police force urged the public to \u201cstay alert\u201d and \u201cavoid going out\u201d as protesters assembled from lunchtime in the retail and entertainment district of Causeway Bay. Chanting \u201cHongkongers resist!\u201d they set off in the direction of the city center and the main government offices. The legislature was evacuated as retailers brought down their shutters. Mainland Chinese businesses were vandalized, and a branch of Starbucks ransacked. Protesters hurled petrol bombs at police, who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets and made scores of arrests. Fires were also lit outside the Sogo department store\u2014a prominent Hong Kong landmark.\n\nLive news streams also showed angry crowds gathering in the tourist district on the Kowloon peninsula. Shouting \u201cFight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!\u201d and singing \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d\u2014the song that many are calling Hong Kong\u2019s \u201cnational anthem\u201d\u2014they headed up the tourist strip of Nathan Road. A small number continued on to the northern district of Kowloon Tong. They erected barricades across Waterloo Road\u2014a major thoroughfare through the affluent suburb that was home to martial arts icon Bruce Lee and which has so far not been affected by the protests.\n\nRTHK, Hong Kong\u2019s government-funded broadcaster, reported that helmeted personnel unfurled a warning flag at protesters from inside the barracks of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army in Kowloon Tong. The personnel also trained spotlights on the crowd. It is thought to be the first time that Chinese troops garrisoned in Hong Kong have \u201cengaged with protesters\u201d during the unrest, RTHK said.\n\n\u201cThe government is doing everything it can to restrict our freedom of assembly because it wants to end the protests,\u201d said a protester named Eva, 50, when asked about the mask ban. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will end unless the army marches in,\u201d she told TIME.\n\nMarching alongside, her husband, 67, said that while he did not agree with violence \u201cThe youngsters feel they have no choice \u2026 the government made them.\u201d\n\nProtesters block a road during clashes with police in the Wanchai district in Hong Kong on October 6, 2019. | MOHD RASFAN\u2014AFP via Getty Images More\n\nIn the late afternoon, live news broadcasts showed protesters erecting barricades and besieging a large police station in central Kowloon. Police on the parapets fired rubber bullets to drive the crowd back. Mong Kok station, a major transport interchange, was flooded, and facilities were damaged at other subway stations. Fires were lit in the premises of mainland Chinese businesses and the offices of pro-Beijing legislators trashed. As night fell, police set up road blocks and began taking mostly young passengers off buses for searching and questioning, causing a major tailback.\n\nRTHK also spoke to students from the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) and Chinese University, who said that police had attempted to enter the campuses without authorization. \u201cPeople living in HKBU halls are all on edge now, as there are rumors that police are coming to halls to arrest people,\u201d one journalist tweeted. \u201cThey are telling one another to lock their doors.\u201d", "description": "Months of unrest have plunged the city into a deep political crisis", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sPR12Q9iC8RJmZ1PoLVN_A--~B/aD0yNzMwO3c9NDA5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/63dcfbf3e570a36832ffc7711a50749c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
