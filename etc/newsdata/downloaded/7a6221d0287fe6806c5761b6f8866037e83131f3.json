The weekly column has exploded in popularity since its launch in 2004 thanks to emotional essays written by the paper\u2019s readers about personal relationships: some funny, some tragic, some about romance, some about friendship, some totally bizarre, and all about different kinds of love.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture. Subscribe By Clicking \"Subscribe\" you agree to have read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n\nThe columns have served as inspiration for a podcast and, now, an anthology TV series launching Friday on Amazon.\n\nWriter-director John Carney, known for inciting mass swoons and harnessing booming emotion in films like Once and Sing Street, masterminded the TV adaptation, eight entries directly inspired by the columns that enlist different directors (including himself, Emmy Rossum and Sharon Horgan) and A-list actors to establish standalone episodes.\n\nHow I Met Your Mother\u2019s Cristin Milioti, who also starred in the Broadway version of Once, is the pregnant woman. Tina Fey and John Slattery head to therapy on the court as the married couple. Fleabag\u2019s Hot Priest himself, Andrew Scott, leads the adoption episode, while Anne Hathaway plays Lexi, the woman with bipolar disorder, in an episode that features singing and dancing in fully staged production numbers set at a grocery store.\n\nThink of Modern Love, then, as Black Mirror... but with feelings.\n\n\u201cI love romantic stories, and I don\u2019t see them in the cineplexes that much right now,\u201d Hathaway told reporters this summer, beaming while apologizing for her \u201cpregnancy brain\u201d as she charmingly rambled on. \u201cFor me, it was really exciting because it was a way for me to tell a genre of story that I love telling that I don\u2019t really get to tell anymore in a way that felt really fresh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not as alone as we think we are\u2026\u201d\n\nWhen the column was launched 15 years ago, the title \u201cModern Love\u201d was deliberately chosen to expand its scope beyond romance.\n\nThere are so many other ways people meaningfully connect\u2014or search for connection\u2014in today\u2019s world, that a focus on romantic love would have been reductive. Whether or not a person makes it to the altar isn\u2019t as interesting as whether or not a person finds a path to understanding themselves and better navigating the complications in their lives. As a happy ending, that\u2019s ambiguous, sure. But so is life.\n\nTurning the columns into a series took more than four years of development, which involved choosing the right performers, directors, outlet, and, most importantly, stories to tell. That\u2019s where Daniel Jones comes in.\n\nJones has edited the column since its launch, watching it grow from a small project he worked on with little notice to a multimedia phenomenon featuring a singing Anne Hathaway. His institutional memory was invaluable in shepherding the series to television. He certainly has his favorites over the years, but more importantly, he\u2019s gained a sense of what kinds of stories, of the countless submissions that flood his inbox each week, will pluck at a readership\u2019s raw nerve; the column\u2019s fans aren\u2019t always in the mood for fluff.\n\n\u201cIt's interesting to see what does get people stirred up both positively and negatively,\u201d he tells me, speaking in Los Angeles during a press push for the show this summer. \u201cIt's in that sort of frisson, I think, that is a lot of the success of the column.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the four earlier mentioned episodes, for example, is one in which a journalist (Catherine Keener) talks her interview subject (Dev Patel) through his fidelity issues. In another, a young woman with \u201cdaddy issues\u201d (Julia Garner) navigates a relationship with an older man (Shea Wigham). And in the final of eight episodes, titled \u201cThe Race Grows Sweeter Near Its Final Lap,\u201d a woman in her seventies discusses the unique experience of encountering love later in life.\n\nNot all the stories end neatly tied in a bow, but each get at a specific kind of emotional need, whether or not it\u2019s expressed, that many people are craving: an antidote of sorts to a palpable cynicism and jadedness, if not outright darkness, blanketing culture today.\n\nJones reckons that the series is happening at exactly the right time.\n\n\u201cJust in the past couple of years, with all the political tumultuousness and meanness, people are looking for kindness now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd those one-on-one relationships that are the most important things in our lives. Maybe we\u2019re trying to shut out some of the noise and pay attention to being good to each other.\u201d\n\nThe series gets off to a touching start with Milioti\u2019s episode. It\u2019s a deceptively simple story. It takes a surprise pregnancy for a single woman in New York to realize that the person who has consistently been there for her is her doorman, a relationship she learns to accept and cherish. No, they don\u2019t fall in love. But their story is a needed reminder that in life, there are profound relationships we have but don\u2019t think to acknowledge. We\u2019re not as alone as we think we are.\n\n\u201cA kindred spirit or connection can be just as powerful as what you see in movies when people fall in love on the street,\u201d Milioti tells me.\n\nThat her episode explores a love that exists outside romance is her favorite thing about it. \u201cIt really leans into the gray. I think as a culture, we\u2019re desperate for a black and whiteness. You just look at our political divide. There's like no room for discourse. It's either this or it's nothing. And I think that in life we cling to that too, because it's control and it's assuredness. The gray is what life actually is, and it's uncomfortable and it's vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEspecially when you consider that Milioti herself starred in an episode of Black Mirror, last year\u2019s Emmy-nominated \u201cUSS Callister,\u201d the comparisons to the dystopian anthology series are inevitable. But if some of the best episodes of Black Mirror explore how technology and the future could actually bring us together\u2014\u201dSan Junipero\u201d or \u201cHang the DJ,\u201d for example\u2014then Modern Love stands out for exposing that we already have the tools for that kind of intense connection. We just have distracted ourselves from using them.\n\nMore, it\u2019s remarkable, in today\u2019s TV landscape, to strip a narrative down purely to emotions and feelings.\n\n\u201cI'm like the 10 billionth person to say this, but we live in a very social media-saturated age, where everyone thinks they're experiencing intimacy and connection but actually we're more isolated than we have ever been,\u201d Milioti says. \u201cI think that people want to put out more of a front and this shows that there is vulnerability, that no one has it perfect. Everyone's a mess. I'm sort of very for that.\u201d\n\nWhen I spoke to the British actor Gary Carr (Downton Abbey, The Deuce), who co-stars in Hathaway\u2019s episode, he had a refreshingly optimistic take on why the series is so topical, and why the need for love is on the top of everyone\u2019s minds.\n\n\u201cI feel like there was so much more love being introduced into the world now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnytime when there is darkness or struggles or in life, I think there\u2019s a resurgence of love, because that\u2019s what we need.\u201d\n\n\u201cA different way to tell a love story\u2026\u201d\n\nJones himself can authoritatively speak to the value a television treatment adds to the original Times columns. He brings up the example of what is perhaps the most famous \u201cModern Love\u201d entry.\n\nIn March 2017, the Times published the essay \u201cYou May Want to Marry My Husband\u201d by Amy Krouse Rosenthal. Rosenthal wrote the piece in the last days of her battle with ovarian cancer. In it, she explains her tragic circumstances, tells the story of how she fell in love with her husband of 26 years, Jason, and makes the case for why someone else would be lucky to date him after she passes. It is, in essence, a dating profile for her husband.\n\nReaders were destroyed by the beauty of the essay. Ten days after it published, Rosenthal passed away.\n\nWhen the piece first came to Jones, it was already delayed, having been toiling in the reader\u2019s submission box, which can understandably take months to get through. Finally, someone flagged the piece and quickly brought it to the book review editor, who happened to be on vacation, meaning it took still more time for it to find its way to Jones.\n\nHe immediately knew they should publish it, but it also needed an editorial process\u2014a rushed one at that, complicated by the fact that there was already a queue of other columns scheduled to be published. He had to edit it, fact-check it, and do it all while Rosenthal barely had the breath to keep up a conversation on the phone.\n\nIt landed like an emotional atom bomb when it finally published. But until then, Jones had an almost clinical relationship to the piece. It\u2019s only when he heard it read as part of the Modern Love podcast that he succumbed to its heartbreak.\n\nThat\u2019s become a typical response for him. Once a week, he\u2019ll receive a rough cut of the podcast and only then, for the first time, will he be as moved as readers, trying to hide his tears from coworkers near his carrel desk in the Times Square New York Times office. When, after all these years of development, he was sent early screeners of the Modern Love TV episodes, he stayed up until 2 am watching them all at once. \u201cI was a blubbering mess,\u201d he says.\n\nAlbeit from a different perspective, Hathaway also spoke to reporters about why she feels this Black Mirror-style, TV anthology format is a perfect fit, at a perfect time, for these columns. She misses telling love stories.\n\n\u201cI think we all identify with feeling busier than we ever have [been],\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just that question of what\u2019s going to get you to the movie theater? What is worth the time to have a cinematic experience? And I think with some of these more intimate stories, people have realized that they can still get a lot out of them by staying at home. So I think that\u2019s probably why they\u2019ve gone that way.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s grateful because that means they didn\u2019t become extinct. \u201cBecause but for this, they might have,\u201d she continued. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I love watching a superhero fall in love as much as the next person, but this is a different way to tell a love story.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, knowing she was about to land the perfect punchline: \u201cMy relationship with my couch is very intimate. And being able to watch my shows on it is fantastic.\u201d\n\nEveryone I spoke to acknowledged there might be an initial dismissal or scoffing at the project, this show with big celebrities about feelings and love, what with everything else going on in the world.\n\nBut if by virtue of its logline, it sounds simple, so too should be the show\u2019s value and its impact.\n\n\u201cI would just love for anyone who watches it to feel less alone,\u201d Milioti says. \u201cIf this show can go toward inspiring people to reach out or open their hearts, I mean, I know this sounds like so Hallmark, but what else do we have right now?\u201d", "description": "Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, and the editor of the popular Times column on why now is the perfect time to adapt essays about all kinds of love into a TV series.
