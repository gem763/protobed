They estimated that the same problem would take 10,000 years for a Summit supercomputer - the most powerful in the world today - to solve.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\"This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm,\" wrote the research team, led by Google AI's Frank Arute.\n\nWhile the peer-reviewed research has drawn plaudits, with MIT's William D. Oliver comparing its findings in Nature to the Wright brothers' first flights, sceptics say Google is over-selling its achievement.\n\nResearchers at IBM, Google's main quantum computing rival, said a supercomputer with additional disk storage can solve the random number problem in at most 2-1/2 days, with greater fidelity - or accuracy.\n\nThey also said Google risked misleading the public by implying the new-style computers would replace existing ones.\n\n\"Quantum computers will never reign 'supreme' over classical computers, but will rather work in concert with them, since each have their unique strengths,\" Dario Gil, director of research at IBM, wrote in a blog https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2019/10/on-quantum-supremacy.", "description": "Google's quantum computer can solve a complex problem in minutes, while it would take today's most powerful supercomputer thousands of years to crack", "authors": ["Douglas Busvine", "Shivali Best", "Image", "Google", "Wikicommons"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707240.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-23-at-151527.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
