The technology allows users to send and receive messages shielded from surveillance, and the contents are inaccessible by the host companies, meaning authorities can\u2019t compel access to them even when equipped with court orders.\n\nOfficials are singling out Facebook for its plans to incorporate encryption for all of its various platforms that are used by more than 2 billion people around the world.\n\nAttorney General William Barr William Pelham BarrHouse Democrats subpoena White House for Ukraine documents Hillicon Valley: Iranian hacking operation targeted campaign, government accounts | House panel pushes Zuckerberg to testify on Libra | Trump officials step up attacks on Facebook encryption Cornyn makes waves with tweet about Justice investigating Biden MORE joined with acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and his counterparts in the United Kingdom and Australia to call on Facebook to hold off on those plans until the company can satisfy their concerns and enable law enforcement to access the private communications of suspects.\n\n\u201cWe must find a way to balance the need to secure data with public safety and the need for law enforcement to access the information they need to safeguard the public, investigate crimes, and prevent future criminal activity,\u201d the government officials wrote in an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Mark Elliot ZuckerbergHillicon Valley: Iranian hacking operation targeted campaign, government accounts | House panel pushes Zuckerberg to testify on Libra | Trump officials step up attacks on Facebook encryption On The Money: Economy adds 136K jobs in September | Jobless rate at 50-year low | Treasury IG to probe handling of Trump tax returns request | House presses Zuckerberg to testify on digital currency House committee pressing Zuckerberg to testify on digital currency Libra MORE this week. \u201cNot doing so hinders our law enforcement agencies\u2019 ability to stop criminals and abusers in their tracks.\u201d\n\nAsked for a response to Wray\u2019s comments, a Facebook spokesman pointed to a statement the company issued in response to Barr\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cWe respect and support the role law enforcement has in keeping people safe. Ahead of our plans to bring more security and privacy to our messaging apps, we are consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology so we can use all the information available to us to help keep people safe,\u201d Facebook said.\n\n\u201cEnd-to-end encryption already protects the messages of over a billion people every day. It is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy,\" the company added. \"We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.\u201d\n\nSilicon Valley and privacy activists have pushed back on efforts to give law enforcement \u201cbackdoor\u201d access, saying it would open up dissidents, journalists and whistleblowers to expansive government surveillance.\n\nSen.
