I\u2019ve forgotten\u2026 Do you want a banana?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m OK for a banana, thanks. We\u2019re in Humphrys\u2019s homely kitchen in his house in west London. And yes, the long-serving co-presenter of Radio 4\u2019s Today programme has been cross with me before. About a year ago, as the Observer\u2019s radio reviewer, I\u2019d written an article about the Today programme that wasn\u2019t entirely complimentary, and Humphrys had fired off an angry email at me, making some points I agreed with, and several I didn\u2019t. I answered, and, after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing, we ended up on fairly good terms. So now, here we are. I\u2019m armed with umpteen readers\u2019 questions for him \u2013 many hostile, I must say \u2013 and Humphrys is all set to answer them.\n\nNow 76, wiry and fiery, dressed in cosy fleece, Humphrys finally retired from Today a week or so ago, after more than three decades at the helm during which he became the show\u2019s best-known host. He\u2019s published his memoirs to coincide with that retirement, and A Day Like Today is a 400-page doorstopper of a book that describes Humphrys\u2019s early life growing up poor but proud in Splott, Wales, and moves through his career as a newspaper reporter, foreign correspondent and TV news presenter. It is very detailed on his years at Today (he joined in 1987, at the age of 43), which provide about two-thirds of the book. Though he doesn\u2019t reveal much about his private life, he is straightforward in his opinions about other people: he doesn\u2019t seem to like Eddie Mair or Jane Garvey very much, for instance.\n\n\u201cEddie Mair is a brilliant broadcaster,\u201d he says today, \u201cbut I dislike his style of broadcasting when applied to a hard news programme. And Jane Garvey is too opinionated for my taste. You shouldn\u2019t lace questions with your own views, and Jane tells the listener what she thinks about everything. But then it is Woman\u2019s Hour, not Today.\u201d\n\nThis last point seems at the very least ironic, given that one reason Humphrys\u2019s detractors dislike him is that they believe they can tell his opinion of interviewees by the way he interviews them. Humphrys argues hard to me that they can\u2019t: though he\u2019s assumed to be a Brexiteer, he voted remain, and he cites a time when a very good friend of his came on to Today, and Humphrys gave him a roasting. (It was Patrick Holden, then director of the Soil Association.)\n\nPlay Video 0:45 John Humphrys signs off from Today programme after 32 years \u2013 video\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Patrick for 40 years,\u201d he says, \u201cand I believe in everything he\u2019s done and does, I believe organic farming is vital, but when I interviewed him, I put the opposite argument to him. I am a devil\u2019s advocate. That is what I do.\u201d\n\nJohn Humphrys, for many, came to epitomise both the good and bad about the Today programme. His tenacious interviewing style was admired when it was used to effect against politicians but, post-Brexit, as the country divided along non-party lines, many felt that his rottweiler questioning technique was used on the wrong people. And his interviews with non-politicians \u2013 fashion journalists, artists, authors, scientists \u2013 could seem naive, even inept. In his book, he admits that, though Today\u2019s researchers always prepared him briefs for interviews, he mostly didn\u2019t read them. Is this true?\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean I am notoriously\u2026 \u2018stupid\u2019 is the only word. Mostly you don\u2019t know what interviews you\u2019re going to be doing until you see them, and the sensible thing to do is to sit down and read the brief very carefully. I don\u2019t do that. It\u2019s a sort of brinksmanship, and also I don\u2019t want to already know the answers to my questions. Not with politicians, but if you\u2019re talking to real people about real things \u2013 somebody who\u2019s just swum the channel 19 times or something \u2013 then if you ask them a question that you genuinely don\u2019t know the answer to, you are genuinely surprised.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Humphrys talking to David Cameron on his last day presenting Today. Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/Reuters\n\nHe\u2019s a strange mix, John Humphrys. He gets upset if presenters voice opinions, but is quick to give his own. He rues the BBC\u2019s liberal bias, but is a natural liberal himself. He is, I think, a highly emotional man, who decries emotion in reporting. He seeks precise answers but sometimes struggles to articulate accurately what he wants to say. And, though he often falls foul of feminists, he is pro-women.\n\n\u201cI detest the word feminism, because of course I\u2019m a feminist,\u201d he says. \u201cGod, why does one have to say it? Obviously, obviously\u2026 Racism is a profoundly moral issue, as is feminism. That\u2019s why I refused to wear one of those \u201cThis is what a feminist looks like\u201d T-shirts. No, it isn\u2019t. This is what a white man looks like, who happens to believe that women are equal to men. I mean, even saying it makes you sound like a dickhead.\u201d\n\nYou seem to prefer being interviewed by women, I say.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe I trust them more. I like talking to women.\u201d\n\nAre you more competitive with men?\n\n\u201cYes! Of course. It\u2019s instinctive, I think. It\u2019s not learned. Or it might be. I went to an all-boys school.\u201d\n\nHumphrys runs a charity, the Kitchen Tables Charity Trust, which helps feed money to small charities in the developing world, mostly those that work with children. We talk a bit about it, how it works, and about his feelings around the misuse of power and the lack of respect for \u201cordinary\u201d people. When he was a young journalist, he witnessed the tragedy at Aberfan \u2013 he thumps the table when he tells me about it \u2013 and saw terrible things, too, when he reported from South Africa.\n\n\u201cYou see children dying of starvation, and you know, you know it\u2019s because of men who want power,\u201d he says. \u201cMen who want power so much that they will do anything. And it is always the men. With our charity, we don\u2019t give any money to men, ever. Because in our experience, if you give the money to a woman, whether it\u2019s running a little business, or a school, or a charity, it\u2019s used for good reasons. You give it to the man, it\u2019s often pissed against the wall. I would always opt for women because I think they are more \u2013 this will get me in trouble with the right-thinking brigade \u2013 because I think women are more sensitive to the fear of abuse of childen. The ultimate measure of a society is first, how we deal with children, and second, how we deal with very old people who can\u2019t help themselves. That\u2019s how you judge the humanity of a society and humanity is what it is all about.\u201d\n\nHumphrys can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s thumping the table again, already all riled up. Time, I think, for some readers\u2019 questions, to keep that fire burning\u2026\n\n\u2022 A Day Like Today is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

It isn\u2019t just the getting up at half past three in the morning and having to go to bed at half past eight at night. It\u2019s all the other stuff. You\u2019ve got to read all the newspapers, or try to. You\u2019ve got to keep in touch with everything that\u2019s happening all the time. And that dominates your life. And I\u2019ve had enough of that.\n\nMichael Carter\n\nObserver reader\n\nAre you ready for the adjustment in your whole life or will you end up at the kitchen table interrogating breakfast cereals by the dawning light?\n\n[Laughs] No, I\u2019m not ready. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m going to do what I\u2019m going to do, or how I\u2019m going to do it, or where it\u2019s going to be done, or who it is going to be done with. And that\u2019s the glory of it. New vistas are open to me. And yes, I\u2019ll probably end up arguing with the DHL man.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Humphrys, left, looks on as fellow broadcasters meet the Queen at Broadcasting House in 2006. Photograph: Anwar Hussein Collection/Getty Images\n\nKate Losowsky\n\nObserver reader\n\nWho do you wish you\u2019d interviewed and never got the chance to, and why?\n\nI\u2019m not a royalist, but: the Queen. She is unique. I got invited to one of these private lunches \u2013 note, private lunches \u2013 three others and me, with Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh. And after we\u2019d had the lunch, I did ask her if she would do an interview with me. She likes to take her coffee, not in the dining room, but in the adjoining room so she can throw bits of food to her doggies. I wondered why she said it in such a posh way, but it\u2019s dorgis, she explained to me. Dachshund corgi, join it together, dorgis. Anyway, I asked her for an interview and I went into a big spiel and said, these are the reasons why you could, you know? And she listened to me very patiently and she said: \u201cNo\u2026 And what\u2019s more, Mr Humphrys, if one were ever to do such an interview, it would certainly not be with you.\u201d\n\nJenni Murray\n\nPresenter of BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important question that needs to be put to Boris Johnson, and what answer would you expect to get?\n\nThat\u2019s a killer, isn\u2019t it? Curse you, Jenni\u2026 How about: \u201cYou tell lies routinely. Do you know you\u2019re doing that?\u201d In a sense it would be a pointless question, because he\u2019d say \u201cflhmpthflfhfhhhmph\u201d [posh waffly Johnson-style noise], but then you\u2019d follow up with, you know, \u201can inverted pyramid of piffle\u201d. And in the process of taking apart his denials, you would get somewhere, I think.\n\nMiranda Sawyer: Were you shocked that Johnson didn\u2019t come on when you were on Today?\n\nHa! I retire and within days, he\u2019s on.\n\nDiana Fowler\n\nObserver reader\n\nI would like to know what John Humphrys thinks the UK will gain should we leave the EU.\n\nI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s much easier to say what we\u2019ll gain, or at least, keep if we don\u2019t leave the union. But obviously we must, and I speak as somebody who voted to remain.\n\nMS: Why do you think people think you voted for Brexit?\n\nI\u2019ve no idea! My reasons to vote to remain are many and varied, and largely to do with, you know, no more war in western Europe and being born in 1943, and all that kind of thing. But people who voted to leave were more\u2026 passionate is such a ghastly word\u2026 more motivated than those who voted remain, because they really did, I think, believe in sovereignty and freedom. Largely, those arguments did not resonate with me. What worries me is that there will be trouble if we don\u2019t leave, unless there is something pretty concrete in its place. Not riots in the street, but if people are told: \u201cYou voted, but now you can just fuck off and die,\u201d that\u2019s worrying.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Humphrys photographed at his home in London. Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer\n\nMatthew Lenton\n\nObserver reader\n\nWhat are your feelings about the effect your earning so much more than them had on your female colleagues, particularly Sarah Montague?\n\nSarah was upset and she was right to be upset. Absolutely right. I didn\u2019t know how much she was earning. I have never talked to any other presenter on the Today programme about how much we earn. I think Sarah\u2019s wonderful. But we never had a conversation about our pay.\n\nMS: Not even after it had come out?\n\nNo. I suppose it is odd in a way. But no. I can\u2019t explain it.\n\nMS: There\u2019s another part to this question\u2026 What are your thoughts on whether you might have volunteered to take a very large pay cut?\n\nI did volunteer. Three times. The first time was when I went back on to the staff, because I\u2019d gone freelance in my mid-30s, when the BBC were keen on making you do it. I regretted it because it meant you had to set up a company and all that kind of crap, which I hated. But they made you do it. I\u2019ve still got the bloody memo saying: \u201cIf you don\u2019t set up a company we can\u2019t pay you.\u201d I got rid of my private company and became a sole trader because I did not like the idea of not paying tax. And the BBC in the end accepted that I could do that legitimately and they could pay me.\n\nMS: Why do you think the BBC wanted journalists to set up as companies?\n\nWe\u2019re talking about nearly 40 years ago, of course, but I think it was a ruse by the BBC at the time to avoid paying national insurance. Where were we? I\u2019ve forgotten the question.\n\nMS: You taking a pay cut\u2026\n\nYes. I\u2019d always thought we should have disclosed our pay, I know I sound like goody two shoes, but it is the case. The important one was when it was announced that presenters\u2019 pay was going to be revealed. I had a chat with James Harding and he said: \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a disparity.\u201d And I said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ll cut my pay,\u201d and I think I went down, I don\u2019t know, a hundred grand. A lot, anyway. And that was that. But they\u2019d left it too late and when the pay was announced, though I\u2019d taken a pay cut, my pay was announced as, I think \u00a3650,000. And it made me the sixth- or seventh-highest paid. It was Mastermind, and my previous salary. And later, two years after that, I volunteered another cut. I ended up with earning about half what I had been earning. I\u2019m not ashamed of it.\n\nAyesha Hazarika\n\nFormer Labour adviser, commentator\n\nYou\u2019re known for your strong views. Do you think it\u2019s right that the BBC found against Naga Munchetty for pointing out how a lot of people of colour interpret the phrase: \u201cGo back\u201d?\n\nNaga Munchetty was absolutely right to \u2013 I hate the expression \u2013 but to \u201ccall out\u201d Trump the racist. Absolutely no doubt about that, it was a racist thing to say. But for Dan [Walker] to invite her then to analyse Trump\u2019s motives, I would be uncomfortable with that, as a presenter. If you\u2019re talking to a political correspondent, like Jon Sopel, then I would ask: \u201cWhat do you think is behind that, then? Why are they doing that?\u201d And that is a totally valid question for a specialist, an expert, who would know much more than you do about the political situation... But I\u2019m slightly uneasy about one presenter asking that of another presenter. Only because of the position that the presenter holds \u2013 which is that of observer, rather than an analyst. I\u2019m not dogmatic about this, by the way, I\u2019m trying to work it through.\n\nMS: But if you aren\u2019t white and you live in a majority white environment, you\u2019re automatically an expert on racism. I mean, just through walking through the world.\n\nThat\u2019s true. Of course, of course. But you\u2019re not an expert in Donald Trump\u2019s political motives. And that\u2019s\u2026 there is a difference there. It\u2019s quite a subtle one, but there is a difference. I think.\n\nI\u2019m not massively proud of how I\u2019ve been a father John Humphrys\n\nMS: Do you think the BBC handled the situation badly?\n\nYes. The BBC invariably handles these things badly. It\u2019s because the BBC\u2019s strengths are also its weaknesses. It\u2019s just that the BBC is not didactic. It isn\u2019t an authoritarian organisation. So there cannot be a single clear BBC view. And I think that\u2019s reassuring.\n\nMichael Kemp\n\nObserver reader\n\nWhich interviewee surprised you the most, and why?\n\nIt was an old woman. I went back to South Africa when they had the first Mandela elections. They\u2019d opened the polling booths a day early for old people, people in wheelchairs, pregnant women, so they wouldn\u2019t be crushed to death in the queue. And I went out too and there were massive, massive queues\u2026 oh, it was deeply moving. And I looked for somebody who looked like promising material for a live interview. I settled on a very old lady \u2013 she looked about 90 \u2013 standing next to a young woman, who was very pregnant. I wanted a bit of righteous anger, a bit of: \u201cThese bastards, apartheid,\u201d all that kind of thing. And 8.10 came and I did a little introduction and I said to the old lady: \u201cYou\u2019re going to be voting soon, what does it mean to you?\u201d And she quietly said: \u201cMmm, for me, not very much.\u201d And I thought: \u201cOh, shit.\u201d And then she hesitated for a moment and she leaned across and patted the swollen stomach of the young woman, and she said: \u201cBut for the young man in this lady\u2019s stomach, it will mean everything. Because he will be granted the gift of dignity that has been denied to me all my life.\u201d And it was\u2026 amazing.\n\nHugh Stokes\n\nObserver reader\n\nDo you feel you ever crossed the line into editorialising, by making contentious statements or challenging interviewees with opinions, particularly in relation to Brexit or climate change?\n\nWell, the answer is obviously yes, there\u2019s yet to be a presenter born who hasn\u2019t crossed that line. Also, if you put a contentious view to an interviewee, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you say: \u201cThis is the view held by Joe Bloggs,\u201d the audience will hear your voice saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as climate change,\u201d and they\u2019ll think you believe it and will say: \u201cWhat a wanker he is.\u201d Quite rightly. Except that you haven\u2019t said it, you\u2019ve attributed to somebody else. But yes, sometimes you will get a bit\u2026 you go over the top.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Humphrys with fellow today presenter Sue MacGregor in the programme\u2019s production office, 1993. Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC News & Current Affairs via Getty Images\n\nMS: What about tone? People react so differently to your tone.\n\nWell, over the years you establish a relationship with somebody like Heseltine, or John Prescott, or Tony Blair, and you know what to expect and then you have that sort of conversation. That is inevitably going to upset a lot of people who might regard Tony Blair or John Prescott as the spawn of Satan. They will react, because we all hear everything in different ways, don\u2019t we? You are allowed to express controversial views that may not be your own, and I think, for instance, Justin Webb got short-changed over that when he interviewed Nigel Lawson about global warming.\n\nMS: People didn\u2019t want Nigel Lawson on at all, because he\u2019s a climate change denier.\n\nQuite. I\u2019ve always hated the word denier because it makes it sound like climate change is a religion.\n\nMS: The word is used in the same way as Holocaust denier. The Holocaust happened. Climate change is happening.\n\nThat is true, but there was a very long period of time when we didn\u2019t know that it was happening. The Holocaust has never been, ever, in any doubt, at all.\n\nSamira Ahmed\n\nBroadcaster\n\nLots of people probably ask you for advice because of your experience, but what you would say is the most important thing you\u2019ve learned from younger staff members?\n\nI know inevitably that I am not going to be \u201cin touch\u201d with young people, in spite of the fact that I have children and grandchildren. Obviously I have a set of prejudices, of attitudes that have developed over the past 76 years. Working with so many young people \u2013 and by young, I\u2019m afraid I mean anybody under the age of 30 \u2013 it\u2019s like you enter into another world. You always learn something.\n\nJamesread\n\nObserver reader, posted online\n\nIs it appropriate to holiday with David Davis and then also to interview him at 8:10 on numerous occasions for a nice cosy chat about Brexit?\n\nAll those holidays, David Davis and I, they\u2019ve all come as news to me. This is the glory of Twitter. There was a bloke who worked for David Davis for a couple of years, and then had a nervous breakdown of some sort, and appeared on Twitter sounding off about various things, including the \u201cfact\u201d that I had gone on holiday with David Davis. But I\u2019ve had lunch with David Davis twice in the 35 years that I\u2019ve known him, and that\u2019s it.\n\nMS: Who do you go on holiday with, John?\n\nI don\u2019t go on holiday very often, unfortunately. Ideally with my partner. I\u2019ve never been on a holiday with a politician. I can\u2019t imagine anything worse. In my 33 years on the Today programme, I\u2019ve had lunch with, maybe\u2026 half a dozen?\n\nMS: Who would they be?\n\nOne of them was the chancellor after Geoffrey Howe\u2026 Norman Lamont. OK, so I\u2019ve had lunch with David Davis. I\u2019ve had lunch with Norman Lamont. I\u2019ve had lunch with, I can\u2019t remember this guy\u2019s name, but he was a very senior figure in Blair\u2019s administration. I had tea in the House of Commons with Gordon Brown. I had a coffee in his office with Tony Blair, in his office in the House of Commons. I think that\u2019s it. No Theresa May, no Maggie Thatcher, no Cameron, none of his lot.\n\nThe management thing is where the BBC goes wrong. It has been hideously under-managed by women John Humphrys\n\nMS: What about newspaper proprietors and editors? Do you ever lunch with them?\n\nI\u2019ve had lunch with a few. Dacre, at Dacre Towers, as it was all those years ago. Once. People like Charles Moore and\u2026 oh, I had dinner once with the last editor of the Guardian. What\u2019s his name? Plays the piano.\n\nMS: Alan Rusbridger.\n\nYes. I had dinner with Alan Rusbridger. I am not a great socialiser.\n\nSophie Walker\n\nFounder of the Women\u2019s Equality party\n\nDo you think you would have had the same success and earning power at the BBC if you\u2019d been a woman?\n\nNo, not in the early days. It\u2019s difficult. Kate Adie was a little bit older than me and she was far more successful than me in the early days. She\u2019s bloody good. And because she was a woman, and an extremely courageous woman, and brilliant, Kate brought something to her reporting that I would not have been able to bring. The management thing is where the BBC goes wrong. It has been hideously under-managed by women, especially when you consider the women who have worked there \u2013 Helen Boaden, for instance, who I wanted to be director general... I\u2019ve been banging on for 15 years about we must have a female director general. No female director general, ever? It\u2019s shocking.\n\nRobert Jones\n\nObserver reader\n\nWould you encourage any young person to go into journalism today?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be encouraging, no, because it is an immensely competitive field. When my son wanted to be a cellist, he had an audition at the Royal College, and I went in with him to turn the pages of the music. When he finished, the tutor said: \u201cHmm, I would advise you not to become a professional cellist.\u201d You can imagine my son\u2019s face. And then the tutor said: \u201cUnless doing anything else would make you very unhappy.\u201d That\u2019s corny, but that\u2019s how I feel about journalism.\n\nRows, bloopers and scoops: John Humphrys\u2019 32 years at Today Read more\n\n\n\nhotfeet\n\nObserver reader, posted online\n\nYou are happy to promote the Daily Mail. You trust them with the story of your life. Do you observe any political bias in the Daily Mail?\n\nThis is about the serialisation of my book extracts in the Mail. The deal was done by the publisher.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Presenting Today with Evan Davis in 2011. Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian\n\nMS: Did the Mail show you the edited version of the extracts?\n\nYes. They did and they not only did that, but they also sought my approval. I was not particularly happy with the splash [the headline] the Mail used, but you know\u2026 I don\u2019t give a flying fuck whether people think that a particular newspaper is biased in this way or that way. All I\u2019m concerned with is that my material is presented in the way I\u2019ve written it and they didn\u2019t change a word.\n\nMS: Do you understand why some people don\u2019t like the Daily Mail?\n\nI have always read the Daily Mail as a journalist because it speaks to an awful lot of people. Its views may in some cases not be compatible with mine. As the views of the Guardian are sometimes not compatible with mine. People should be able to read views other than their own, or their own views, whichever they choose. They have the choice. And if you\u2019re going to say the Mail is a vicious, pernicious, hideous, biased, prejudiced, cruel, wicked newspaper, then that\u2019s fine. You\u2019re entitled to say that. I don\u2019t happen to believe that; its campaigns around plastic or people with dementia or racism \u2013 Stephen Lawrence \u2013 are exemplary. But to say that the 5 million people who read the Daily Mail are themselves somehow inferior to, let us say, the people who read the Guardian or the Observer\u2026 that is grotesque. It is hugely offensive. I mean, I know people who read the Daily Mail whom I like.\n\nRabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks\n\nFormer chief rabbi\n\nIn his most recent book, the New York Times columnist David Brooks talks about how people scale two mountains in their lives. The main part of their lives is focused on the self \u2013 being a success, making a mark \u2013 but having reached the pinnacle of the first mountain, they sometimes find it unsatisfying or empty, and realise that there are even bigger things in life that they want to achieve. And so they climb the second mountain, one focused on things that have real value. John, having reached the pinnacle of your first mountain, what second mountain are you planning to climb?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t often say this of Jonathan Sacks, who is a deeply thoughtful man, but he\u2019s wrong, the underlying assumption of the question is wrong. I haven\u2019t scaled a mountain. I\u2019ve been successful because I\u2019ve done a job well enough to stay in the job for a long time, and if you stay in any job for long enough, you get respect for the fact that you survived. But I haven\u2019t done anything that I think when\u2026 when my children, grandchildren and partner, whoever, stand around my death bed, I\u2019d be able to say: \u201cYou see, I did that.\u201d And one\u2019s hope is that one might do something, and it could be something immensely small but important, but I don\u2019t feel I have yet.\n\nMS: What are you planning to do that might be that thing?\n\nWell, maybe\u2026 trees? I\u2019m a guy who has planted a few woodlands in my time, and I would love to find out something about woodlands, about trees, just from observation and talking to lots of people who know, but that\u2019s an interest rather than a mountain to climb.\n\nMS: It\u2019s a crucial interest at the moment.\n\nBut more important than that, I\u2019ve been a very average father. I\u2019ve provided and all that, but I\u2019ve never felt that I\u2019ve been\u2026 I\u2019m not massively proud of how I\u2019ve been a father\u2026 I\u2019ve excused my personal behaviour, the way that I\u2019ve related to and treated the people who are closest and most important to me. And obviously my children are top of that list.\n\nMS: How was your wife about you being away a lot? [Humphrys married Edna Wilding in 1964. They divorced in the late 80s and she died in 1997.]\n\nMy wife was a nurse, and she helped to run the first spina bifida unit in the country \u2013 for some reason there\u2019s a very high incidence of spina bifida in south Wales. And so she was doing an important job, much more important than my job. And when she became pregnant, I said: \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d She said: \u201cI want to give up work, and I do not intend to work again until the kids are at university.\u201d I can remember where we had the conversation. It was a mutual decision. I mean, it suited me perfectly because then I could go away, and of course she always did work at schools, voluntary stuff. But it meant that I missed stuff with the kids. I mean, when I first became a foreign correspondent, it meant being away for months at a time. Then the Today programme came along, and that meant working stupid hours. And so you haven\u2019t got time. I now have time and I hope that I\u2019ll use that time more\u2026 meaningfully. God, this sounds wishy-washy!\n\nMike Morris\n\nObserver reader\n\nIn an interview with Helen McEntee on 26 January, you said Irish exports to the UK were about 50% of total exports. It\u2019s actually about 13% to 14%. Were you troubled by that sort of basic factual error or do you feel your \u201cinterviewing style\u201d was more important?\n\nOf course I\u2019m troubled about any factual errors. It is what I was told, and I repeated it, I probably should\u2019ve gone back over it in some detail and it did slip through the net. But that\u2019s nothing to do with my interview style.\n\nmalarkey\n\nObserver reader, posted online\n\nWhy are you so suspicious of art?\n\nI\u2019m not! You\u2019d have to be a moron to be suspicious of art. When I see a Turner masterpiece or listen to a piece of Bach or read a wonderful book, I am swept away. But I am sceptical about, for instance, found art. I don\u2019t understand how something becomes art because someone important says it\u2019s art. It\u2019s such an interesting conversation but it gets you nowhere. I can\u2019t help feeling that Damien Hirst is not worthy of being in the same room as Turner, but my knowledge is not huge. It\u2019s more heart than head for me, disgracefully, because it\u2019s instinctive.\n\nPlay Video 0:45 John Humphrys signs off from Today programme after 32 years \u2013 video\n\nJames Atkinson\n\nObserver reader\n\nWere you open about your conservative views with your editors when you were presenter on the Today programme? And did they try to compensate in any way?\n\nThat is such a stupid question. I am not conservative, you know. I am genuinely one of those pathetic people who has very strong views about issues. I think it\u2019s quite difficult to be a hack for as long as I\u2019ve been and come out of that with firm politics. I\u2019m a reporter and my views are informed by what I see and the people I talk to. So every other bloody week I change my mind about something or other, and when you vote, you look for the party that comes closest to what you believe.\n\nSimon Mayo\n\nDJ\n\nWhy did you insist on wearing the worst headphones in the world?\n\nBecause, Simon, because when I\u2019m sitting in a studio, I want to hear what the interviewee is saying, and those headphones enable me to do that. But they also let me communicate with the person sitting on my left, and I like to be able to communicate with my fellow presenters, as well as with the outside world. If I was in a studio by myself, then maybe I would have those bloody headphones that make you look like a pensioned-off airline pilot. But \u2013 get a life, Mayo!", "description": "The former Today host reflects on his broadcasting brinkmanship and new memoir, and takes questions from famous contemporaries and Observer readers", "authors": ["Miranda Sawyer"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12804756ce321f5dba8fbef4714e5a628c5b53f3/49_140_6512_3908/master/6512.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a566583037f2dc4c866109762755d394", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
