When Donald Trump used the phrase against four Democratic congresswomen in July, few could doubt his implication that they did not belong in America.\n\nSo when the BBC presenter Naga Munchetty discussed the issue with co-host Dan Walker on breakfast TV, her condemnation of the tweets as racist, and her anger at the racism she has faced, seemed both honest and stating the obvious.\n\nNot to the BBC. Last week, its complaints unit generated a storm by ruling that while it was \u201clegitimate\u201d for Munchetty to have \u201creflected her own experience of racism\u201d, it was wrong \u201cto comment critically\u201d on the president\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d or the \u201cconsequences\u201d of his words. David Jordan, the corporation\u2019s director of editorial policy and standards, subsequently clarified that it was fine for Munchetty to have called the tweet racist, but not Trump.\n\nThere are three problems with this. First, Munchetty did not call Trump racist. She said she was \u201cfurious\u201d that he \u201cthinks it\u2019s OK to skirt the lines by using language like that\u201d. Second, other BBC journalists have called the president racist. Its New York correspondent, Nick Bryant, for instance, tweeted about Trump\u2019s \u201cracial demagoguery\u201d. And, third, the BBC\u2019s distinction is specious. If I can offer an opinion on the racial nature of a tweet, why not on the person tweeting?\n\nThere are indeed real issues about reporters blurring the line between reportage and personal viewpoint. Munchetty, however, was not reporting on the topic but expressing her opinion. Ruling her comments inappropriate not only reins in the calling out of racism but makes it more difficult to draw the line between news and opinion.\n\n\u2022 Kenan Mailk is an Observer columnist", "description": "The BBC Breakfast presenter had every right to express her anger at Donald Trump\u2019s racist comment", "authors": ["Kenan Malik"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b1b9225a46e14a1c57768e08d2ab22084d28b74/0_703_2870_1722/master/2870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=bc863c59abb47056f9e2b491cd40d373", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
