If the victims were Black or Latino or Lesbian or Gay or Trans, and if they were being beaten up by \u201cstraight\u201d Caucasian Christian males, all the nation would be hearing about it. Just think back to how the Corrupt Journalist Corps lied and wailed about those darling teens from Covington Catholic. But the truth vitiates the narrative because it is Jews getting beaten up by people who consistently are members of one of three discreet groups favored by the Intersectionalists. The attackers are captured on camera, and their names are revealed soon enough. So the Corrupt Journalist Corps ignores the stories.", "description": "", "authors": ["Dov Fischer", "Spectator.Org Am-I-The-Only-One-Who-Does-Not-Give-A-Rats-Patoot-Over-The-Ukraine-Garbage"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
