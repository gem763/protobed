He decided he didn\u2019t need Sanchez or Lukaku. That\u2019s his problem. He has his own players now, so he has to deal with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He (Solskjaer) didn\u2019t have a conversation with me if I will play or not. I signed a new contract for two years, one of the best managers in the world wanted me to stay. But after that, when a new manager comes and I\u2019m not in his plans, of course it was time for me to leave and I don\u2019t regret it at all.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018You see some players go straight into the dressing room after games and go straight onto social media. It\u2019s wrong.\n\n\u2018Now you have a new manager who wanted young players and they will be up and down, up and down; that\u2019s football, that\u2019s what happens with young players.\n\n\u2018Of course you can\u2019t play with just young players, you need a mix. To win games, to win titles, to win big games you need experience. Of course you can win with young players, but not every game.\u2019\n\nMORE: Rio Ferdinand names Daniel James as Manchester United\u2019s \u2018most influential\u2019 player and defends Solskjaer\n\nMORE: Manchester United planning four new signings as club retains support for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer", "description": "Marouane Fellaini believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has created a problem of his own making by relying too heavily on young players who are more interested in cultivating their image on...", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1081735972_1570879754.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
