Matt Bevin in his re-election battle against Democrat challenger Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear.\n\nBevin, first elected governor in November 2015, is seeking a second four-year term as governor and faces Beshear in a November 5 general election.\n\nA poll released by Maxon-Dixon Polling & Strategy on Wednesday shows that Bevin has pulled into a tie with Beshear, a significant improvement from the eight point deficit he had in the race as measured in a poll released by the same firm in December 2018.\n\n\u201cRepublican Governor Matt Bevin has pulled into a tie with Democratic challenger Andy Beshear. Statewide, 46% of likely voters now support Bevin and 46% back Beshear. At the beginning of the year, Beshear held a 48%-40% lead over Bevin,\u201d Mason-Dixon reported in its poll summary.\n\nBevin is bringing Republican voters back into the fold, with his GOP support increasing from 67% in December to 77% at present. Bevin is also receiving a\n\nstronger cross-over vote, drawing 22% of Democrats compared to Beshear\u2019s 15% from Republicans. . . Bevin\u2019s resurgence could be attributed to President Donald Trump\u2019s popularity in Kentucky and strong resistance to his impeachment among its voters.\n\nStatewide, 57% approve of Trump\u2019s performance as president and 65% oppose efforts to impeach and remove him from office.\n\nThe poll of 625 registered voters was conducted between October 10 and 13, and has a four point margin of error.\n\n\u201cBevin has made a concerted push to bring the possible impeachment of Trump into the campaign news cycles, and the Mason-Dixon poll shows evidence that most agree with the governor\u2019s stance against such a move by Congress,\u201d the Louisville Courier-Journal reported on Wednesday:\n\nOnly 29% of respondents say they favor the impeachment of Trump and his removal from office, while 65% oppose such actions. Even in Louisville and its surrounding counties, 50% of respondents oppose the president\u2019s impeachment and removal, while 78% Eastern Kentucky respondents oppose Trump\u2019s removal. Trump has an approval rating of more than 50% in all categories except for the Louisville Metro region and among Democratic and independent respondents. Though below 50%, the poll still indicates that a sizable 34% of Democrats approve of the president\u2019s performance.\n\nPresident Trump has been effusive in his praise of Bevin, tweeting his endorsement of his re-election on Tuesday:\n\n\u201cGovernor Matt Bevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky!\u201d the president said in the tweet.\n\n\u201cHe continues to protect your very important Second Amendment. Matt is Strong on Crime and the Border, he Loves our Great Vets and Military. Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has,\u201d he added.\n\nGovernor @MattBevin has done a wonderful job for the people of Kentucky! He continues to protect your very important Second Amendment. Matt is Strong on Crime and the Border, he Loves our Great Vets and Military. Matt has my Complete and Total Endorsement, and always has! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2019\n\nMason- Dixon\u2019s December 2018 poll of the race showed Beshear with an eight point lead over Bevin, 48 percent to 40 percent.\n\nBoth Mason-Dixon polls of the Kentucky race had a plus or minus four point margin of error. The October 2019 poll included eight percent more Democrats among respondents than Republicans, while the December 2018 poll included ten percent more Democrats among respondents than Republicans.\n\nThe Cook Partisan Voting Index (PVI) of Kentucky\u2019s six Congressional Districts shows a Republican PVI that ranges from +9 to +31.\n\nAn June 2019 poll of the race conducted by Gravis Marketing showed Bevin with a six point lead, 48 percent to 42 percent, over Beshear.\n\nFour years ago, Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy released a similar poll of the race for governor in Kentucky three weeks before the November 2015 election. That poll showed Democrat nominee Conway beating Bevin by two points, 43 percent to 41 percent.\n\nOn election day in November 2015 Bevin defeated Conway by eight points, 52 percent to 44 percent.", "description": "A poll released Wednesday shows impeachment backlash is boosting GOP's Matt Bevin in the Kentucky governor's race.", "authors": ["Michael Patrick Leahy"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/wi/ap/12/1d4620_kentucky-governor-race-trump-85278-donald-trump-matt-bevin-in-thursday-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
