I mean that seriously.\n\n'A bit silly to say, but I really think so.'\n\nIt is not the first time Van der Vaart has laid the boot into Maguire, having previously criticised his performance on the international stage during the Nations League.\n\nWhen England were beaten 3-1 by Holland, the Dutch midfielder-turned-darts-player was on punditry duty and he remembers it well.\n\n'It's funny because during the Nations League, I was doing work for Dutch television,' he noted.\n\nThe Dutchman also said that if Maguire was worth \u00a380m, then Virgil van Dijk is worth \u00a3300m\n\nVan Dijk played against the Englishman on Sunday, with the match ending in a 1-1 draw\n\n'And I remember we were saying Harry Maguire was by far the worst player on the pitch.\n\n'And then two months later, \u00a380-\u00a390m? Unbelievable.'\n\nMaguire made 10 clearances against Liverpool on Sunday, and was part of a United defence that held out Liverpool for 85 minutes until Adam Lallana's late equaliser.\n\nEven so, United will likely be happy to have salvaged a draw against a team as impressive as Liverpool, who had won all eight of their matches heading into Sunday's clash at Old Trafford.", "description": "Maguire played the full 90 minutes as United held Liverpool to a 1-1 draw on Sunday, but ex-Tottenham star Van der Vaart was far from ready to praise the England defender for his part in proceedings.", "authors": ["Ben Nagle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/06/19977612-0-image-a-9_1571636587428.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
