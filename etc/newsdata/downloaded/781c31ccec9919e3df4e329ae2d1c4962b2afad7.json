Many cultures were known to eat flatbreads topped and flavoured with different ingredients. However, most historians trace the origins of modern day pizza back to the city of Naples, in Italy. Pizza, which means pie in Italian, had long been a popular street food in Naples. However, it wasn\u2019t until the 19th century that it really began to look, and taste, like the pizza we know today.\n\nIs there a royal pizza?\n\nMargherita pizza.

The local pizzaiolo (pizza maker), Raffaele Esposito, created a new pizza topped with red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil \u2014 the colours of the Italian flag \u2014 as a tribute to their visit. The queen, Margherita, loved the new dish. Because of this, the new kind of pie became known as Pizza Margherita.\n\nHow did pizza come to North America?\n\nGetting a tour of Lombardi's original pizza oven.

The first known pizzeria popped up in New York in 1905, and more followed in other big cities. However, these first pizza places were thought of as serving an exotic foreign food. This began to change after World War II as many returning veterans had developed a taste for pizza from their time in Naples! Back home, they introduced their families to this \"exotic\" treat.\n\nHas pizza always been sliced?\n\nPhoto credit: JEO Photography on VisualHunt / CC BY-NC-ND\n\nOriginally, in Italy, pizza was sold as smaller whole pies. It\u2019s hard to say who first had the genius idea of cutting a pizza into slices and selling it that way. One popular story from turn of the century explains how pizza sellers in New York would walk up and down the street with metal washtubs full of pizzas on their heads, sell the pizza for pennies a slice.\n\nLike unique pizza toppings?

Today, different places are famous for their unique versions of pizza. For example, Chicago pizza is made in a deep dish, with a crust on the bottom. In the middle is usually a pound of shredded cheese and other toppings, and then the whole thing is topped with tomato sauce and baked. Some people say it\u2019s more like a casserole than a pizza!\n\n\n\nHawaiian pizza.
