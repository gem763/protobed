The rash typically lasts between four and seven days, while other symptoms can last up to two weeks.\n\nSymptoms typically develop within seven to 21 days of exposure, which means Sept. 29 to Oct. 13 in this case.\n\nThere have been three confirmed measles cases in Ottawa so far this year.", "description": "Ottawa Public Health\u00a0is warning someone from Montreal who had a confirmed case of measles made a brief visit to a ByWard Market restaurant on\u00a0Sept. 22.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309173.1570207339!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/grand-pizzeria-ottawa-byward-market.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
