He resigned alongside several other AKP lawmakers.\n\nHis resignation may have been a preemptive move, as the AKP had been widely expected to dismiss Davuto\u011flu, having launched disciplinary action against him.\n\nDavuto\u011flu first served as foreign policy advisor to Erdo\u011fan before becoming foreign minister in 2009. In 2014, when Erdo\u011fan moved to the presidency, Davuto\u011flu succeeded him as prime minister. He later fell out with his former ally and was forced to resign as prime minister and AKP leader in 2016.\n\nIn recent months, he has repeatedly voiced criticism of the AKP, in particular after it decided to annul the Istanbul mayoral election \u2013 which the AKP lost \u2014 earlier this year.\n\nDavuto\u011flu is the second senior AKP member to resign this year: Former Economy Minister Ali Babacan quit the party in July.", "description": "Ahmet Davuto\u011flu said he would start a \u201cnew political movement.\u201d", "authors": ["Marc Steinau", "Emma Anderson", "Paola Tamma", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-498569688-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
