This is part of our education we have to come out of the boy zone and play like a man and respect the game. They are very talented and learning to be ruthless.\n\n\"Kasper is really happy, The only other keeper to have a nine was his father. We believe in our work, believe we can push over the course of the season. Our mentality is how we work every day. The players want to get better and improve.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"A great, great win and now we have to focus on the cup game.\"\n\nSouthampton's Nathan Redmond did not hold back in his assessment of the match, telling Sky Sports: \"It was an embarrassing performance, the stuff of nightmares and especially playing at home.\n\n\"It just wasn't good enough and one of the poorest performances since I've been at the club and we'll have to debrief that whole game from start to finish tomorrow.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\n\"There were a host of things that went wrong - the red card decision and then the quick goal at the same time. We conceded goals far too quickly in the first half.\n\n\"We need to do much, much better. I think we had a few players out of position after the sending off and we tried to deal with it as best we could.\n\n\"There are the things we need to look at tomorrow but it was an embarrassing performance.\"", "description": "Leicester secured the joint-highest win in Premier League history as they thumped Southampton 9-0 at St Mary's", "authors": ["Aaron Flanagan", "Image", "Reuters", "Afp Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20727109.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Southampton-v-Leicester-City.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
