'I'm confident in what we're trying to do and with my staff, I've been so impressed. The improvement is there to see.\n\n'We need to start winning games, start scoring goals and we need to create more chances because at the back we've looked solid.\n\n'But we haven't been adventurous enough and taken enough risks. The best teams around take more risks and more runs in behind. Maybe the boys when they lose confidence they play safe and it's my duty to say it's not safety.'\n\nWoodward has made it clear in public and in private talks with Solskjaer that his job is secure even though United have slipped to 12th place in the table after eight games, and could feasibly drop into the bottom three by Monday night.\n\nThe poor start has raised questions over their decision to let Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez leave for Inter Milan in the summer without signing a replacement striker.\n\nUnited's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward this week gave Solskjaer his full backing\n\nHowever, both Woodward and Solskjaer insist it was the right thing to do to move United forward in the long run.\n\n'I speak to Ed loads of times,' said Solskjaer. 'We speak regularly and, as we've spoken about so many times, we do have a plan.\n\n'We know that we have made some decisions that maybe in the short-term would harm us but we know in the long term will benefit us and that's part of the plan.\n\n'The time is always right to make the right decision. It was the right time to make those decisions and to go on with the squad that we have.\n\nSolskjaer cut an upbeat figure at Friday's press conference despite United's current problems\n\n'Of course, the injuries didn't help. We're getting players back now, I'm sure that from now until Christmas if you can see a full strength squad we'll get the results. But the last few weeks have been difficult and hard, they have been yes.\n\n'But it's not like two or three weeks will tell me it was the wrong decision, no they were the right decisions. Listen, the culture that we want to build, I had to make those decisions, that's it.\n\n'Results are always the main thing and we can move forward quicker if we get results and performances. But I'm sure that we will get there. It is still planning for the next transfer window and the summer transfer window and how we see the team moving forward.'", "description": "Ole Gunnar Solskjaer insists the Manchester United job is not too big for him as he tries to turn around the club's worst start in 30 years.
