A 19th death was reported in Connecticut.\n\nThe outbreak is \"continuing at a brisk pace,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC said during a news briefing Thursday.\n\nIn addition to the updated injury and death count, researchers from the Mayo Clinic said in a report released Wednesday that some patients\u2019 lung damage resembled chemical burns.\n\n\"This is a critical issue,\" Schuchat said.\n\nStates have responded to the reports with force. Massachusetts banned all vaping products for four months. New York, Michigan and Rhode Island, as well as Los Angeles county, rushed to ban flavored e-cigarettes. San Francisco banned e-cigarette salts. And California\u2019s health department issued a \u201cstop vaping\u201d advisory to the public.\n\nAs the legislative frenzy unfolds, some experts said separate problems associated with e-cigarettes and vaping are being conflated. The emergence of the lung injuries and deaths, seemingly out of nowhere, has sparked fear and confusion about what products may be dangerous and why as well as how many people are at risk.\n\nE-cigarettes and other vaping devices have exploded on the market since they first started gaining popularity in 2007. And the sheer number and variety of products in the retail market as well as the black market, including products containing THC, have made determining the cause of the disease outbreak that much more difficult.\n\nHere is what to know:\n\nProblem no. 1: E-cigarettes or E-Joints?\n\nWhile public health officials haven't identified a single culprit in the more than 1,000 cases of vaping-related lung injuries, officials say many of the people who have become sick reported vaping THC.\n\nActing FDA commissioner Ned Sharpless said agency testing led the FDA to believe people were mixing pure THC with other oils to dilute the product, creating illegal and untested vaping liquids.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of the more than 500 patients sampled reported using THC products, Schuchat said during Thursday's news briefing.\n\n\u201cA significant fraction of the THC products are contaminated with vitamin E acetate,\u201d Sharpless said during a congressional hearing Sept. 25. The oil, generally used on skin, has \u201cno business being in a pulmonary product,\u201d Sharpless said. He believes vitamin E acetate was added as a cutting agent.\n\nEva Hambach/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTHC is the active ingredient in marijuana and because marijuana is still illegal under federal law, products containing THC can\u2019t be regulated by agencies like the FDA. Federal officials say states that have legalized recreational or medicinal marijuana are responsible for regulating the safety of those products.\n\nA crackdown on counterfeit or adulterated THC pods would require multiple federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, working with states to identify the sources of contaminated pods and eliminate them, arrest people manufacturing or selling them illegally, or block imported vaping products or supplies coming into the U.S. from other countries, Sharpless and Schuchat said in the Sept. 25 hearing.\n\nSo instead of lumping all vaping products into the \u201ce-cigarette\u201d category, Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health, refers to THC devices as \u201ce-joints\u201d or \u201cvape pens.\u201d\n\nThe distinction, he said, is important, given that a handful of states have already enacted emergency regulations banning e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cTheir whole rationale is that we have people dying from the outbreak,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cThey\u2019re declaring an emergency because of marijuana vaping products and the response is to ban e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIt's a complete non sequitur.\u201d\n\nProblem no. 2: What is the 'vaping epidemic'?\n\nSeparate from the recent trend of vaping-related lung illnesses and deaths, public health officials have used the phrase \u201cvaping epidemic\u201d to describe the popularity of vaping devices like Juul. Juul\u2019s incoming CEO said the company\u2019s future is at risk due to unacceptable levels of youth usage and eroding public confidence in our industry.\"\n\n\"We appreciate the work of the CDC, FDA, and other public health authorities, and are confident that they will get to the bottom of this issue,\" a Juul spokesperson told ABC News.\n\nUntil a late September news conference, when CDC officials pointed to the risks of THC devices, the CDC \u201ccompletely conflated the two issues,\u201d Siegel said.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of damage was done by that,\u201d he said.\n\n\"While this investigation is ongoing, CDC recommends that people consider refraining from using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, particularly those containing THC,\" said Brian King, a spokesperson for the CDC.\n\nWhile officials and advocates are especially concerned about the growing popularity of these products among young people, because they have a high concentration of nicotine, which can have harmful effects on the developing brain, including addiction, those worries appear to be separate from the spate of acute lung injuries and deaths gripping the nation.\n\nMaricopa County Sheriffs Office\n\nPrior to the newfound popularity of e-cigarettes, agencies reported declining rates of tobacco use among middle and high school students, but teen e-cigarette use has risen sharply since 2017, according to a government funded survey released last month.\n\nResearch has also found that teenagers who smoked e-cigarettes were more likely to experiment with traditional cigarettes than non-smokers were.\n\nThe concern about flavored e-cigarettes is tied to this trend because many young people report being introduced to the devices through flavored products, and experts and officials say they are concerned that companies are actively trying to appeal to younger customers through flavors that mask the taste of tobacco.\n\nThe rising rates of youth use have also increased the focus on how e-cigarette companies are advertising their products, including on social media where young people are likely to be exposed to advertising that portrays nicotine products in a positive light.\n\nProblem no. 3: Are e-cigarettes safe?\n\nApart from the vaping outbreak and federal investigation, there\u2019s a third issue: experts know very little about how safe -- or unsafe -- nicotine e-cigarettes are compared to traditional cigarettes.\n\nTo that end, the CDC has warned that \"the aerosol that users inhale and exhale from e-cigarettes can potentially expose both themselves and bystanders to other harmful substances, including heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and ultrafine particles that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs.\"\n\n\u201cI wish we could have these dramatic, awesome data sets showing us the answer,\u201d said Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander, an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, who researches the long-term effects of e-cigarette use on health.\n\nWhile much of Crotty Alexander\u2019s research is on animals, which can\u2019t necessarily be extrapolated to apply to human health, Crotty Alexander said that based on her research, she believes daily vaping is going to cause disease over time.\n\nHowever, while non-smokers shouldn\u2019t pick up the habit, she said, \u201cit\u2019s hard to believe that e-cigarettes would be equally harmful or worse than conventional tobacco, because conventional tobacco is so bad.\"\n\nThe CDC advises that while e-cigarettes have the \"potential to benefit adult smokers who are not pregnant if used as a complete substitute for regular cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products,\" scientists \"still have a lot to learn about whether e-cigarettes are effective for quitting smoking.\"\n\nSo while blanket bans may help deter teen smoking, they could potentially harm adult smokers trying to quit.\n\nBut forgoing a complete ban has greater risks, according to Crotty Alexander.\n\n\u201cWe are setting up this whole new generation of non-smokers to become addicted to nicotine,\u201d she said.", "description": "Vaping injuries broke 1,000 Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest numbers.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/ecigarette-smoker-gty-jc-181109_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
