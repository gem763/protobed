Anything's possible but I don't believe it.\"\n\nWhat does the Politico report say?\n\nThe allegations appeared in an exclusive story for US news site Politico on Thursday.\n\nInternational mobile subscriber identity-catchers (IMSI catchers) - informally known as StingRays - were reportedly found near the presidential residence and by other sensitive sites across Washington DC during the Trump presidency.\n\nThese devices act like mobile phone towers, tricking phones into sending their location, identity information, and even call contents and data usage.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Devices were reportedly found near the White House\n\nOne of the former officials who spoke anonymously to the site said the StingRays were likely designed to spy on President Trump. He said it is not clear if they succeeded.\n\nFBI counterintelligence agents conducted analysis to find out where they came from. \"It was pretty clear that the Israelis were responsible,\" a former senior intelligence official told Politico.\n\nThis same official also criticised the Trump administration, saying they did not publicly or privately reprimand the Israeli government for the alleged spying.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any accountability at all,\" the former official said.\n\nDespite Mr Netanyahu's denials, Israel has spied on the US in the past.\n\nRafi Eitan - a Mossad agent who captured Nazi Adolf Eichmann in 1960 - was exposed in the 1980s as the handler of Jonathan Pollard, a US analyst who gave thousands of top secret documents to Israel.\n\nIn 2006, former US Department of Defense employee Lawrence Franklin received a 13-year prison sentence for passing classified documents on US policy towards Iran to Israel. His sentence was later reduced to ten months' house arrest.\n\nYou may also be interested in:", "description": "A Politico report said Israel was likely behind surveillance devices found near the White House.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A966/production/_108766334_056397819.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
