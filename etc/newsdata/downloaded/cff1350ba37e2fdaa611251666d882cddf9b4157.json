Norton has now said he decided to leave the outlet after it defended the likes of US supreme court then-nominee Brett Kavanaugh and published articles by future prime minister Boris Johnson containing falsehoods.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I signed up to be their agony aunt, I was aware that it was a rightwing paper and that didn\u2019t bother me, but about a year before I left, it took a turn and there were some things in that paper about which I thought, \u2018I cannot be contained within the same pages as this.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere was a piece defending Brett Kavanaugh and things president Trump had said about [Kavanaugh\u2019s] accuser, and I just thought, \u2018This is toxic.\u2019 And I loved that job; I absolutely adored doing it, but ultimately I didn\u2019t love it enough to be part of that stable.\n\n\u2018I love drag. It's dangerous\u2019: Graham Norton and Alan Carr on desire, camp and \u2018cancel culture\u2019 Read more\n\n\u201cI just had to step away, which saddened me, but I was beginning to feel a bit nauseous. It\u2019s a weird thing: these very nice people would say, \u2018Oh, I love your column in the Telegraph\u2019 and I\u2019m looking at them thinking, \u2018You read the Telegraph?!\u2019 That\u2019s not good, that\u2019s not a happy situation to be in.\u201d\n\nThe presenter of The Graham Norton Show made the comments while undertaking promotional work for the latest series of his Friday night show. He said he didn\u2019t explain to the newspaper at the time his reasons for leaving, but now wanted to clarify the decision.\n\nNorton claimed the Telegraph\u2019s standards were substantially below those of US newspapers. \u201cAnother awful thing is the fact they were such a mouthpiece for Boris Johnson with no fact-checking at all. He wrote an article where one of his solutions to the Irish problem was to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain and you only need to talk to one engineer to find out that\u2019s it\u2019s not possible: the depth of the ocean, the weather conditions; you cannot do that. So how is he allowed to publish an article in a newspaper suggesting it was possible?\n\n\u201cIn America you couldn\u2019t do that. The New York Times or The Washington Post, if they get caught out there\u2019s hell to pay. When I do an interview with an American newspaper, I get all these follow-up calls, asking, \u2018Did you say this?\u2019 and \u2018Can you just verify the spelling of the surname of the person you mentioned?\u2019 They\u2019re really on it in the way that, no disrespect, we\u2019re not on it here. And when I found out how much they paid him \u2013 to do a weekly column he\u2019s paid like a quarter-million a year, so I just thought, no.\u201d\n\nNorton said he was restrained in his political opinions because of his BBC job: \u201cOther people who work for the BBC are very political but I don\u2019t feel comfortable doing that. I think when you work for the BBC you\u2019re in a slightly different position. Having said that I do vote and have opinions. I\u2019m not on marches. You wouldn\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who I vote for, but I don\u2019t say who I vote for.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Telegraph said: \u201cGraham\u2019s weekly column was widely enjoyed by our readers, and we wish him all the very best with his future plans.\u201d\n\nThe Telegraph has since found a replacement for Norton as its agony aunt: Richard Madeley.", "description": "BBC chat show presenter explains why he stopped writing advice column for paper", "authors": ["Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b9eada4359dd412dc99b39f2a4c1f2baa5fa4bc/183_110_2807_1683/master/2807.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d39ac71c34bfaa91ad106855b1333ad2", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
