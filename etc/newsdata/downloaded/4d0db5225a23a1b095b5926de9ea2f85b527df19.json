For him, it was a joke about Betsy DeVos and the \u201cBowling Green Massacre.\u201d The tweet got 460 likes when he had just 200 followers on Twitter, and it was a thrilling, empowering feeling. \u201cNow,\u201d Gu says, \u201cit almost feels like when patients get a drug tolerance, and you need a larger and larger dose of the same drug to get the same physiological effect. Now I find that if one of my tweets get 4,000 likes and retweets, it\u2019s just business as usual.\u201d\n\nYou might recognize Gu from another one of his viral tweets \u2014 a photo of himself in his hospital scrubs, taking a Colin Kaepernick\u2013inspired knee to protest white supremacy, the one that got 51,000 retweets and 182,000 likes and made him an Asian American social justice hero. Or maybe you\u2019ve seen his op-eds for HuffPost and The Hill, or his appearance on Democracy Now! Or maybe you\u2019ve spotted him in Donald Trump\u2019s replies, often one of the first to tell the president that what he\u2019s doing is wrong. Or maybe you heard about the federal lawsuit he joined (and won), along with six others, against Trump for blocking users on Twitter.\n\nGu had learned just how powerful the platform could be: it was a tool that could amplify his voice and politics, but also be a tool of manipulation \u2014 used to bully his critics or silence those he abused. Eventually, the same platform that built him up would threaten to be his undoing.\n\nThe way he tells it, Gu\u2019s story began early one morning in April 2016, when two armed US marshals showed up at his door. He\u2019d just gotten home from a long night of surgery in the trauma unit at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where he was a surgery resident, when he heard the violent banging on his door. The marshals waited outside. They didn\u2019t need a warrant, they told him. They had a congressional subpoena.\n\n\u201dIt just totally floored me,\u201d Gu says. \u201cThese are words that ordinary, everyday people don\u2019t really know or have to deal with in their daily lives.\u201d Before the marshals showed up, he lived an ordinary life. Like many Asian Americans, he told me, he was focused on the hard work of becoming a doctor. He was liberal leaning, but uninterested in \u201cgetting involved in the messy politics of activism.\u201d\n\nBut as it turned out, the research he\u2019d started during medical school had put him in the heart of a controversial battle. Gu studied babies with congenital heart disease, and later those with bilateral renal agenesis (babies born without kidneys \u2014 who have a nearly 100 percent fatality rate). He wondered if he could use tissue from aborted fetuses to save newborns. The tissue, he reasoned, was going to be classified as biohazardous waste and thrown into the incinerator anyway. What if it could save lives instead?\n\nGu opened a small lab called Ganogen with a few friends and colleagues. They bought their own equipment \u2014 autoclaves, rats for experiments \u2014 and ordered fetal tissue from a company called StemExpress to implant in rats. Ganogen\u2019s operations were ostensibly legal, but in 2015 the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion organization, released a sensationalist and heavily edited video that claimed that Planned Parenthood employees were \u201cstealing baby parts\u201d for StemExpress. The video alarmed conservatives like Tennessee congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who issued subpoenas to dozens of companies that were using fetal tissue for research, including Ganogen.\n\nInstead of being praised for his research, he got a congressional subpoena as punishment\n\n\u201cI think it was an altruistic thing [StemExpress] was doing, and they were punished for it,\u201d Gu says. (Acquiring fetal tissue for research is legal as long as it\u2019s not for profit; anti-abortion activists insist that StemExpress was making a profit. StemExpress chief executive Cate Dyer told The Washington Post, \u201cWe want to accelerate lifesaving research, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d) Gu had hoped to publish some of the data he\u2019d collected for Ganogen, but the subpoena effectively \u201csilenced\u201d him, along with the promising field of fetal-tissue research. Not long after, Vanderbilt brought Gu into an office with the hospital\u2019s program director, the director of media relations, lawyers, and \u201call these top-level people.\u201d (Gu says this meeting took place in April or May of 2016; Vanderbilt says this meeting did not take place, though Gu was \u201ccounseled repeatedly about the need to assure that his social media activity did not interfere with the primary purpose of his employment.\u201d)\n\nAccording to Gu, Vanderbilt advised him to speak very little about his research, and to be \u201cextra careful about journalists, be extra careful even to Democratic congresspeople.\u201d They suggested that Gu lie low. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make any sense to me,\u201d Gu says. He\u2019d spent his whole life lying low, doing what he was supposed to do. Instead of being praised for his research, he got a congressional subpoena as punishment. He no longer wanted to stay silent. \u201cBased on everything I\u2019ve learned throughout my life \u2014 studying American history, understanding how the political system works \u2014 in our country and in a democracy, the only way to safeguard your rights is by speaking out and making your case.\u201d So Gu decided to fight back.\n\nHe defied Vanderbilt and appeared on NPR\u2019s Science Friday to discuss the subpoena and his research. After Gu\u2019s NPR appearance, his tweets started getting more replies and retweets, and his follower count grew. If he was going to battle his program, he learned that social media would be a powerful weapon in his arsenal.\n\nGu saw Colin Kaepernick and the football players who took a knee to protest white supremacy and police brutality. In September 2017, he decided that he would do the same thing, remembering something that happened to him at Vanderbilt a few years ago. It was a \u201cvery traumatic event,\u201d Gu says. In January of 2016, he had been driving to work when a couple in a car flagged him down in the garage. He stopped the car and rolled down his window, unsuspecting. He recalls hearing the couple yell, \u201cHey chink! You can\u2019t fucking drive!\u201d Gu parked and tried to head to the hospital, but the man from the car followed him, grabbed Gu\u2019s name badge by the lanyard, almost choking him. He followed Gu up nine flights of stairs to the hospital, even pulled Gu\u2019s patient files out of his hands. Gu called the police, but they told him that they didn\u2019t think the man was dangerous.\n\nIn Gu\u2019s telling, when he demanded they press charges, the cops said that the man could also press charges against Gu for reckless driving. Both men were arrested. The incident stunned Gu. His voice rises when he recounts it. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond preposterous to be given a misdemeanor arrest for being racially and physically attacked in your own hospital, where you\u2019re not even believed by your own police.\u201d It reminded him of the congressional subpoena, the injustice of it: he was doing research to save the lives of babies, yet was accused of killing them. It was like a \u201cbizarro opposite world,\u201d and he\u2019d never experienced anything like it until he left California for Tennessee. According to Gu, he tried to process the incident through Vanderbilt, but \u201c[Vanderbilt] didn\u2019t really care that much internally.\u201d\n\nNow, however, he had enough time to process what happened. Besides, #takeaknee was now a hashtag and a social phenomenon. That afternoon, wearing \u201cthe same white coat and scrubs I wore on that day I got attacked, in the same hallway [the man] was stalking me,\u201d he explains, he stopped one of the nurses walking past, knelt down, raised one fist, and smiled for his photo.\n\nAs Gu recounts it in an email: \u201cAn African American nurse passing by took the photo for me and raised her fist in solidarity when she saw me take a knee, and I raised my fist too and that\u2019s why I am smiling in the photo because we both smiled when we did that gesture.\u201d\n\nThe drama unfolded not only on Twitter, but was widely reported in media outlets\n\nAccording to Gu, not long after he posted the photo, a patient\u2019s mom started making aggressive Facebook posts about him, using \u201cderogatory names and pretty racially tinged language.\u201d When she finally met him at the hospital, she asked him to leave the room, suggesting that his political beliefs made him unfit to treat her son. Weeks later, Vanderbilt placed Gu under suspension, citing performance issues. Vanderbilt also stated that it would continue an investigation into Gu\u2019s personal safety and the safety of other employees. Gu says VUMC called the suspension \u201cnonpunitive.\u201d He wondered, How could it be anything else?\n\nThe battle was on. Gu posted excerpts of the letter from VUMC about his probation on Twitter. According to Gu, the medical center asked him to clarify that his views on Twitter were his own, and not those of Vanderbilt. They also pinned a tweet (first tagging Gu directly, then deleting his handle from the tweet), reiterating their social media policies. (According to VUMC, \u201c[Gu] was never instructed to edit or modify the substantive content of his social media activity.\u201d) On Twitter, Gu called that bullying. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to suppress me so hard and ruin my career,\u201d he tells me. The drama not only unfolded on Twitter, but was widely reported in media outlets \u2014 from BuzzFeed News to USA Today \u2014 which portrayed Gu as victim and hero.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty, on July 1st, 2018, Vanderbilt ended Gu\u2019s residency contract, denying that the termination had anything to do with his activism. In a publicly posted letter, VUMC wrote: \u201cOur administration, faculty, and residency program leaders have shown a consistent commitment to the principles of diversity, integrity and fairness, and will continue to adhere to these principles even when unfairly and falsely accused of not doing so.\u201d\n\nThe letter strikes a defensive tone to me \u2014 reading it now, to me it almost sounds as if Gu wasn\u2019t the one who\u2019d been wronged by VUMC, but somehow that things might have been the other way around.\n\nI spoke to @DoctorMeowskis over the phone not long after the news about Vanderbilt came out. Allison* (her name has been changed to protect her identity) is a 30-year-old medical student in a \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d town within driving distance of Tennessee. Her voice is bright, a little chirpy. Allison began turning to Twitter as an outlet for the stresses of medical school. She quickly became part of the #MedTwitter world, where doctors and medical students discuss their work, ask earnest questions or offer advice, or tweet medical puns and jokes. Allison liked to post funny, candid anecdotes from her life: detailing a date with a cardiologist (which #MedTwitter compared to watching Grey\u2019s Anatomy), or talking about her struggles with her studies. One day, around December 2016, she got a DM from Gu, telling her that he was impressed by how open she was on Twitter.\n\nIt was months before Gu would become Twitter famous for his kneeling photo. Allison had been impressed by his credentials \u2014 a surgeon who had gone to Stanford and Duke \u2014 and thought he looked cute in his pictures. Their conversation turned from DMs to texts, which turned into phone calls. In the beginning, Allison says, Gu was charming. They talked about Marsha Blackburn, and when Gu talked about his research, he told her how much respect he had for the women who donated the aborted fetuses. \u201cWhen he talked about that, he was a very impressive man,\u201d Allison says.\n\nThey spent hours on the phone. \u201c[Gu] called me a lot, even when he was at work,\u201d Allison says. \u201cHe\u2019d spent 15, 20 minutes standing in the stairwell. I thought that was cute.\u201d They talked about other things, too, like their views on marriage and children. And they talked about Twitter. Allison gave Gu tips on how to get more followers: you make a hashtag about something that\u2019s trending, then jump in the conversation. She remembered when Gu tried out the strategy for the first time how happy he was that it worked. He told Allison that they would become Twitter\u2019s \u201cpower couple.\u201d\n\nHe was often on his phone, \u201cfocusing more on Twitter than me, asking me to retweet stuff\u201d\n\nFinally, Gu invited Allison to visit him in Nashville for Valentine\u2019s Day in 2017. He promised to show her around town, and to let her shadow him at work. \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d Allison said. She got lost trying to find his apartment building, and then, when she met him, she was surprised at how different he seemed from the impression he\u2019d made online. From his picture, she\u2019d imagined him as cute, tall, and confident. In person, he seemed mousy and uncertain, and he apologized constantly.\n\nThere would be many more disappointments on that visit. It turned out that she couldn\u2019t actually shadow Gu at work, since he\u2019d forgotten to get permission from his program. And when they went out to lunch, he was often on his phone, \u201cfocusing more on Twitter than me, asking me to retweet stuff.\u201d He spoke about how much he wanted to get \u201crevenge\u201d on Vanderbilt through his Twitter following. His apartment was a mattress on the floor and a dining room table.\n\n\u201cI was like, Wow, okay, that\u2019s how a big-time surgeon lives,\u201d she says. They took a nap, and when she woke up, he was already between her legs, putting a condom on. \u201cIt was over as soon as it began. I didn\u2019t have time to think about it\u2026 I guess we kind of said we\u2019re seeing each other. I was a little upset about it,\u201d Allison says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted to have sex with him.\u201d But then again, she reasoned, she couldn\u2019t feel too upset. She\u2019d agreed to come to Tennessee as a date, after all. The next few days, Gu left her alone while he went to work. She went to the Whole Foods near his apartment, bought him snacks and pineapple (his favorite fruit). She was looking forward to Valentine\u2019s Day, when Gu promised to go on a real date. But when the date came, they were interrupted again by his feud with Vanderbilt.\n\nGu\u2019s adviser had asked him to come in for a meeting, where they told him again that he couldn\u2019t speak badly about VUMC online. \u201cHe got really angry,\u201d Allison says. When he eventually calmed down, they went to a local pizza place for their romantic date.\n\n\u201dYou\u2019re the only person in the world I can talk to,\u201d Gu told her. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you, I might have killed myself tonight.\u201d Back at Gu\u2019s apartment, he started \u201cpawing\u201d at her while she tried to refuse. She tried to push him away. He kept at it. \u201cIt was just like that until he passed out. That\u2019s when I got up, turned on the shower, and was crying.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was Mary. @MaryLauryMD had introduced herself to Allison on Twitter even before Allison had met Gu in person. She didn\u2019t think anything unusual of their conversation. After all, Allison had talked to other female doctors on Twitter, many of whom turned into real-life friends. But her conversations with Mary took strange turns, especially after the Valentine\u2019s Day visit. Mary often talked about Gu: \u201cI follow Gu because I saw him on the news,\u201d she\u2019d say. And: \u201cI think he\u2019s so hot, and I\u2019ve never had sex with an Asian guy before.\u201d Mary said that she printed out Gu\u2019s picture and posted it on her wall. \u201cI make sure I retweet him all the time so he notices me,\u201d Mary said. \u201cHe\u2019s retweeting you a lot \u2026 are you dating him?\u201d\n\nAllison told her no \u2014 even if Gu called her \u201cbaby\u201d over text, they weren\u2019t officially in a relationship. \u201cI was scared that if I told [Mary] we were dating, she would go psycho,\u201d Allison says. \u201cShe seemed creepy, like she would get aggressive and post it all over her timeline and dox me.\u201d Mary\u2019s messages were making Allison nervous. When she brought the DMs to Gu, he quickly dismissed it. He told her that many people wrote to him on Twitter, but Allison was the only one he talked to.\n\n\u201cDid you see that people are saying Mary is actually Gu on Twitter?\u201d\n\nAllison\u2019s contact with Gu slowly tapered off in the months after they met. Eventually, Allison muted Gu\u2019s account. (She thought he would notice if she unfollowed him, and she didn\u2019t want to risk it.) Eventually, Mary\u2019s messages stopped coming, too. Then, in July 2018, another controversy struck #MedTwitter, with Mary at the heart of it. She\u2019d accused an account called Dr. Glaucomflecken of donning blackface. Dr. Glaucomflecken\u2019s avatar was an ophthalmoscope dressed up with a top hat, cartoon eyes, mustache, and goatee. One could potentially interpret it as blackface \u2014 or see it as a personified, accurate representation of a black medical instrument. Allison thought it was ridiculous. She had been following Dr. Glaucomflecken for a while, and \u201che never said anything mean about anyone.\u201d\n\nAfter Allison saw that Gu had retweeted Mary, she decided to call out Mary\u2019s bizarre accusation. Her spotlight on Mary drew others\u2019 attention, too. While Allison was out, her friends texted her. \u201cDid you see that people are saying Mary is actually Gu on Twitter?\u201d\n\nAllison freaked out. Then she saw the growing evidence: Mary posted pictures that were actually Gu\u2019s, and posted things about Vanderbilt that no one other than Gu would have known. The hospital where Mary claimed she worked didn\u2019t list a doctor under her name. When Allison finally tweeted at Gu to stop tweeting as Mary, the account was immediately deleted. \u201cThat was enough evidence for me,\u201d Allison says. \u201cThis Mary character who I\u2019ve met would have loved this controversy. She would have loved the chance to defend his honor.\u201d\n\nBefore I spoke to Allison, I had noticed unsettling tweets from Mary Laury\u2019s profile, too. I was writing a profile on Gu, and I\u2019d been trying to get in touch with some of his critics. Though I agreed with Gu\u2019s left-leaning political views, it was clear most media coverage of him was very one-sided: they only told Gu\u2019s story, the one that made him out to be a victim and hero. I tweeted at an especially ardent critic, the (now deleted) @NefariousMD, asking for his perspective on Gu. @NefariousMD often posted screenshots of an unsettling piece of Gu\u2019s past: a series of arrest citations, including filed restraining orders and allegations of domestic violence. I\u2019d come across the allegations early in my research, and asked Gu about it in our interviews.\n\nGu told me that all the charges from the filings had been expunged. \u201cThe labeling of these things sound terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t use family law court filings that get dismissed by a judge as evidence of wrongdoing, but you can paint a really bad picture about someone.\u201d He said the citations were tactics of an overly aggressive lawyer, and that it wasn\u2019t fair to bring his ex-wife into the story. At the time, I\u2019d agreed. But still, something gnawed at me, something that didn\u2019t feel quite right. Maybe it was how easily Gu sounded indignant during our interviews, or the tense, charged terms he used to describe the alleged discrimination he suffered, or how, in every narrative, he was always the victim.\n\nA day after I tweeted at @NefariousMD, I got a surprising email from Gu. \u201cIf you do a story with [@NefariousMD\u2019s] input, it would be a gross miscarriage of journalistic integrity and ethics,\u201d Gu wrote. And: \u201cany allegations of domestic violence are completely unwarranted\u2026 Please know that any publication insinuating that I committed any act of domestic violence will be met by a libel and defamation suit.\u201d He emphasized again that there were no court records for the arrest charges and criminal records in the screenshot often shared online, which meant that they\u2019d been expunged by a judge.\n\nDays after Mary posted the photo, @NefariousMD\u2019s Twitter account was gone\n\nThe tone of his email was completely different from any of our prior interactions. The email seemed unwarranted, excessive. I looked back at @NefariousMD\u2019s tweets, trying to understand what would unnerve Gu so much that he would try to stop me from even having a conversation. Aside from posting domestic-violence screenshots, @NefariousMD also tweeted about Gu\u2019s \u201csock puppet accounts,\u201d including @MaryLauryMD. I\u2019d noticed Mary\u2019s account before, and it hadn\u2019t seemed remarkable. There were tweets about social justice issues and retweets of other physician activists. But her replies to @NefariousMD took a very different tone.\n\nShe spoke as if she knew @NefariousMD personally, implied that he was a fellow resident in Gu\u2019s residency program, and alleged that he was responsible for a patient\u2019s death in increasingly graphic terms. \u201cThe public demands to know why @nefariousmd got away with ramming a central line into a patient\u2019s carotid artery, killing the patient with a massive stroke. Is this standard of care at Vanderbilt? Why is a white resident like @nefariousmd held to a different standard?\u201d she tweeted.\n\nIn the course of one day, June 8th, I counted over 60 tweets directed at or related to @NefariousMD in intense, graphic language. Finally, Mary went even further, posting a photo of a patient on a hospital bed: body bare on the operating table, lines and tubes inserted into his chest, perhaps the same patient she alleged that @NefariousMD had killed.\n\nThe tweets were disturbing; the photo was shocking. Even if @NefariousMD had been racist at work, even if he had been responsible for a patient\u2019s death, I couldn\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like to be constantly reminded of your mistake, to see a photo of a patient you lost posted in a public forum.\n\nDays after Mary posted the photo, @NefariousMD\u2019s Twitter account was deleted.\n\nMary Laury\u2019s account was bizarre, aggressive, and confrontational, unlike Gu\u2019s, and I wanted to understand what, exactly, Gu was trying to do with Mary\u2019s account. Did it exist to torment other users, defend himself from perceived attackers? Could he have been doing it for fun? For possible answers, I spoke to Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor in Communication, Culture, and Digital Technologies at Syracuse University and author of a book on online trolls. According to Phillips, Gu\u2019s alter ego account made perfect sense for someone with a high profile. \u201cIn some ways,\u201d Phillips tells me, \u201cit sounds like brand management.\u201d\n\nGu had built a popular persona as a staunch progressive, a social justice activist. He\u2019d gotten extensive, positive press coverage of his story: the hardworking Asian American doctor attacked by conservatives, by his own medical program for daring to stand up against racism. \u201cBy cordoning off his positive account from the more antagonistic account, it allows the media coverage to be more universally beneficial to his narrative and his brand,\u201d Phillips says. The fake account, meanwhile, was a way for Gu to freely retaliate against critics, without harming the identity that he\u2019d so carefully built up.\n\nIt\u2019s much harder to pinpoint why he might have felt the need to be hostile at all. \u201cMy work has deliberately sidestepped psychological profiling questions,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cIn many cases, we just don\u2019t have access to people\u2019s inner emotional ecosystems. Even if we [do] \u2026 people are really busy trying to manage their public perception. There\u2019s a very high likelihood that someone accused of problematic behavior is going to downplay it or lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very high likelihood that someone accused of problematic behavior is going to downplay it or lie.\u201d\n\nPhillips believes it\u2019s the performative element of social media that most influences someone\u2019s decisions and behaviors. People\u2019s behavior online tends to correlate to a group norm: \u201cIf the performative expectation in [Gu\u2019s] mind is that he needs to behave in this highly progressive, staunch social-justice orientation, of course that\u2019s how he\u2019s going to behave.\u201d But on Mary Laury\u2019s account, Gu was free. And while Gu\u2019s case may seem extreme, brand management is something that everyone does, online or off. It stems, after all, from the same basic human desire: as social creatures, we want to be accepted and loved.\n\nAnd the way Gu became obsessed with his Twitter following, brought it up often in his offline life, imagined it as a tool of revenge? Perhaps that wasn\u2019t so far-fetched, either. According to Phillips, Gu was using social media in exactly the way it was designed to be used. Twitter and Facebook aren\u2019t incentivizing restraint, after all: they incentivize communication and exaggeration, the more the better. Gu\u2019s case was a \u201cgrotesque extension of how a lot of people use these sites and are encouraged to use these sites by the sites themselves,\u201d Phillips says. \u201cThese companies make money off convincing people that social media engagement is a validation of a person\u2019s worth, that our sense of self-worth, who we are and why we matter, is tethered to quantitative metrics. And that can go to a very ugly place very, very quickly.\u201d\n\nAllison had told me that she hadn\u2019t wanted to go public with what happened between her and Gu: he was supporting good causes, and she didn\u2019t want to take anything away from that. But discovering the Mary Laury account pushed her over the edge. In July 2017, she tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m freaking out now knowing my ex boyfriend was tormenting me with a fake female account. Sending me DMs obsessing over him, asking intimate details about my sex life, and then trying to convince me they slept together. I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d She described a man obsessed with his Twitter following, a date that turned into something resembling sexual assault: \u201cHe is on top of me, groping me, trying to kiss me as I keep trying to get up and telling him no. Moving my face away from his kisses. He kept saying he wanted to have unprotected sex so he could get me pregnant so I could never leave him. I continued to fight him off until eventually he tired himself out and passed out.\u201d\n\nFor a while, before I spoke to Allison, I debated about whether to write this story, too. Even if Gu had a shadow side, even if he had unresolved questions from his past, he had experienced racism in his residency program, and he was starting conversations that were important. But maybe it was just as unfair to erase the complications. Maybe Gu could be both a victim and entitled by his role as a victim.\n\nNot long after Allison\u2019s tweets went viral, Gu posted his own account of what happened between the two of them on Twitter. In his version, Allison was the seducer, and he the unwilling victim. Allison\u2019s allegations were \u201c100 percent empathetically false,\u201d he said. He denied many details from the Valentine\u2019s Day meeting, including the fact that he went in for a meeting with Vanderbilt. He sent a sexually explicit voicemail and a drunk voicemail that he allegedly received from Allison months after the Nashville visit as evidence of his innocence. On Twitter, he claimed that Mary Laury\u2019s account was \u201can anonymous account people close to me created to address the trolling issues I was encountering from Trump supporters on Twitter. After a while I also shared access of this account to help combat the trolls.\u201d Gu described using the burner account to \u201cturn [Allison] off from me and drive a wedge between us romantically.\u201d (Later, in an email to The Verge, he contradicts this statement: the Mary Laury account was \u201cwas originally an account meant for my mom to learn how to use Twitter. That must be clarified.\u201d)\n\nIf you read his timeline today, you wouldn\u2019t be able to spot any signs of the whirlwind with Allison and Mary Laury\n\nOn Twitter, Gu ended with a broad statement against sexual assault and harassment. \u201cMen can be victimized by women too. And false accusations without due process is a weapon of terror,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know public figures are supposed to handle whatever attacks come our way, but sometimes things are just too much for a human being.
