The 29-year-old joined the Raiders this summer after seven seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals, during which time he received 13 suspensions and fines. Two of the suspensions were for illegal hits, and the NFL cited Burfict\u2019s history as part of the reason for the ban, which will extend to the playoffs, should the Raiders make the postseason.\n\nMichael Signora (@NFLfootballinfo) Vontaze Burfict suspended for remainder of 2019 season for violations of unnecessary roughness rules. pic.twitter.com/oSMl2iSRNW\n\n\u201cThere were no mitigating circumstances on this play,\u201d the NFL\u2019s vice president of football operations, Jon Runyan, wrote in a letter to Burfict explaining his suspension. \u201cYour contact was unnecessary, flagrant and should have been avoided. For your actions, you were penalized and disqualified from the game. Following each of your previous rule violations, you were warned by me and each of the jointly appointed officers that future violations would result in escalated accountability measures. However, you have continued to flagrantly abuse rules designated to protect yourself and your opponents from unnecessary risk.\u201d\n\nNFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) #Raiders LB Vontaze Burfict has been ejected for lowering his helmet to initiate contact pic.twitter.com/R8GHiJI6NF\n\nHelmet-to-helmet hits, which can lead to both players receiving concussions, are taken particularly seriously by the NFL given the link between football and brain trauma.\n\nBurfict\u2019s head coach, Jon Gruden, spoke about the ejection of the linebacker, who is one of the team\u2019s captains, after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision, it\u2019s a tough call. I think it was a flag,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt was very well-documented that the league was going to review those plays this year in New York City. So, that\u2019s what happened and I\u2019ll wait to hear what their reasoning was. But it was a penalty, he went in there with his head down, it was called and, unfortunately for us, it was an ejection.\u201d\n\nBurfict has three days to lodge an appeal against his suspension and his agent said they would do so. \u201cThe 12-game suspension is excessive and the play that triggered the suspension was a football play,\u201d Lamont Smith told ESPN.\n\nBurfict will not be paid during his ban. He was due to make $1.15m in salary this season, not including bonuses.", "description": "The NFL has suspended Oakland Raiders linebacker Vontaze Burfict for the rest of the season for a gratuitous helmet-to-helmet hit", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee011a03344d59198d05340ebf29fb14e598422/0_478_2395_1437/master/2395.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e5da0b543475e8ed81ee6a9e568b0c4", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
