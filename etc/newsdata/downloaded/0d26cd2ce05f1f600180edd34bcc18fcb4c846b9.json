For example, prices to replace the control board for a Maytag clothes dryer ranged from $335 to $614 at different shops in the area, and prices to replace the inner glass on the door for a Whirlpool oven ranged from $156 to $361.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen you\u2019re looking for a repair shop, first check if the appliance is still under warranty \u2014 if it is, you\u2019ll be limited to factory-authorized shops. Unfortunately, manufacturers don\u2019t necessarily pick the best companies to perform their warranty repairs. Manufacturers rarely, if ever, check on the quality of their authorized shops, and those that do conduct only occasional cursory reviews. Checkbook found that shops performing warranty repairs get far lower ratings from their customers than shops that don\u2019t.\n\nWhen you call shops, be prepared to describe your appliance\u2019s symptoms and its manufacturer and model number.\n\nIn addition:\n\n\u2022 Be sure to find out how the company charges for service calls. Ask about the minimum charge and how much time is included in the minimum.\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 Ask how the shop figures repair charges. About half the services Checkbook rated use a flat-rate schedule \u2014 they compute a job\u2019s labor charge by multiplying its hourly labor rate by the amount of time allotted for that job according to one of several published manuals. Others charge on a time-and-materials basis for the work performed beyond the time covered by their minimum service call charge. Checkbook found that hour rates vary dramatically, so be sure ask what that rate is.\n\nAD\n\nWhen you get a diagnosis, ask for a written estimate before proceeding with repairs.\n\nAnd then you may have a decision to make: To repair or replace? It\u2019s not always a clear-cut decision.\n\nAD\n\nFor example, the \u201caverage life span\u201d cited for appliances can be misleading. If you have an appliance that is seven years old, and it has an average life span of 12 years, it\u2019s actually very likely to work well beyond that average figure. Also, don\u2019t assume that because one component of an appliance breaks means that others will soon follow. The appliance might last years without any further problems. Also factor in your usage \u2014 if you only do a few loads of laundry a week, the washer/dryer is apt to last longer than average.\n\nOn the other hand, you might yearn for new features, a new look or greater energy efficiency. (Keep in mind that some appliances, like clothes dryers, aren\u2019t much more efficient now than they were years ago, and even with appliances that have made strides, energy use won\u2019t change if you only do a handful of loads a week.)\n\nAD\n\nIf you decide to repair:\n\nAD\n\n\u2022 Ask about any warranties on parts and labor.\n\n\u2022 Ask to keep, or at least see, any replaced parts. You have a right to them.\n\n\u2022 Ask for a dated invoice before paying. It should itemize charges for labor and parts, and include any warranty.\n\n\u2022 If you can, pay by credit card. If there is a problem, you can dispute the transaction with your credit card issuer.\n\nKevin Brasler is executive editor of Washington Consumers\u2019 Checkbook and Checkbook.org, a nonprofit organization with a mission to help consumers get the best service and lowest prices.
