(Sebastien St-Jean/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHere\u2019s one thing the leaders of Canada\u2019s major political parties agree on: They oppose Quebec\u2019s new ban on public employees wearing hijabs, turbans or yarmulkes on the job.\n\nHere\u2019s another: They\u2019ve got no plans to do anything about it.\n\nWith an election for Parliament less than three weeks away, Quebec\u2019s Bill 21 has become an increasingly uncomfortable topic for the candidates for prime minister.\n\nThe legislation, the first of its kind in North America, has drawn criticism across Canada and among rights advocates worldwide. But it has support in Quebec, a key battleground in the tight race between Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and opposition leader Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservatives. The French-speaking province holds 78 of the 338 seats up for grabs in the Oct. 21 vote.\n\nWhich is why the leaders have been somewhat muted in their criticism.\n\nTrudeau, who opposed the bill before it was approved in June, has said he doesn\u2019t believe free societies should be \u201callowing discrimination against anyone.\u201d Scheer said in Montreal this week that he wouldn\u2019t implement such a law at the federal level. Green Party leader Elizabeth May called it \u201cdistressing.\u201d New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh, a Sikh who wears a turban, described it as \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d\n\n\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet. (Andrej Ivanov/Reuters)\n\nBut only Trudeau has left the door slightly ajar to \u201cintervening at a later date.\u201d Several organizations have filed legal challenges to the bill. The prime minister, who represents a district in Montreal, has said it would be \u201ccounterproductive\u201d to join such a challenge now.\n\n[Canada\u2019s Trudeau is trying to change the subject from his blackface pictures. Is it working?]\n\nAll of which disappoints Amrit Kaur. Kaur, a Sikh woman from Quebec, graduated from teachers college June 16 \u2014 the day Bill 21 was approved. Rather than remove her turban to work in her home province, she moved across the country to take a job in Surrey, B.C.\n\nKaur, an activist with the World Sikh Organization of Canada, said she\u2019s tired of federal leaders paying \u201clip service\u201d to criticism of the ban but not taking action.\n\n\u201cIt shows that they\u2019re just pandering for the sake of votes \u2014 and not for the sake of the values that make us Canadian,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nWomen protest Bill 21 in Montreal in June. (Christinne Muschi/Reuters)\n\nQuebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault has described Bill 21 as another step in the lengthy process of secularizing the province in which the Catholic Church long wielded outsize influence. Police officers, teachers and other public employees hold positions of authority in their communities, he says, and shouldn\u2019t be wearing symbols that might promote their faith while they serve the public.\n\nCritics see the legislation as an assault on the practices of Muslims, Sikhs and other religious minorities, many of them relative newcomers to the province. Politicians and activists across Canada and beyond have condemned it; local leaders in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta have passed resolutions opposing it.\n\n[In Canada\u2019s election, running against Trump is good politics]\n\nBut polls have shown nearly 2 in 3 Quebecers support the law \u2014 making it a \u201chot potato,\u201d pollster Christian Bourque said.\n\n\u201cA leader of a federal government would be going against somewhat of a consensus in the province,\u201d said Bourque, of the Leger polling firm in Montreal. \u201cThey can quickly do away with the issue by saying they won\u2019t personally challenge it.\u201d\n\nComplicating the politics is the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois party, which supports the law and is competitive in several districts in the province.\n\nMontreal\u2019s English-language school board, the province\u2019s largest, says four job applicants who wore hijabs withdrew their applications rather than remove their veils. One returned and said she would take the hijab off.\n\n\u201cIt is very unfortunate,\u201d school board spokesman Michael Cohen said. \u201cBut we had no choice.\u201d\n\nGroups including the English-language school board and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association are challenging the law in court. But the federal party leaders have taken a different tack.\n\nSingh is one of them. On a campaign stop at a Montreal market Wednesday, a man suggested the Ontario-born and -educated lawyer remove his turban so he would \u201clook like a Canadian.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Canadians look like all sorts of people,\u201d Singh replied. He later told reporters that his very presence in Quebec was \u201can act of defiance\u201d against the law but that he would let the courts handle it.\n\n[Justin Trudeau\u2019s colorful mother takes the stage to tell all]\n\nThat suits Quebec\u2019s premier just fine. Legault asked the federal leaders last month to promise to \u201cstay out\u201d of any legal challenges \u201cforever.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not good enough for Jack Jedwab. The president of the Montreal-based Canadian Institute for Identities and Migration says it\u2019s hard to square the leaders\u2019 reluctance to intervene with the promises they\u2019ve made to tackle racism and systemic discrimination after revelations last month that Trudeau wore blackface several times as a younger man. (Trudeau has apologized.)\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re truly committed to issues of combating discrimination and inequality, you would think that these leaders would take stronger positions on Bill 21,\u201d he said.\n\nAmira Elghawaby, a board member of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, said she\u2019s \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the leaders for \u201cthrowing minority communities under the bus because [they] don\u2019t feel that speaking up for our rights and freedoms is worth it.\u201d\n\nNaheed Nenshi, the Muslim mayor of Calgary, sees \u201ca real lack of courage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from the federal leaders is a lot of mumbling apologia about dignity and human rights,\u201d he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. this week. \u201cAnd then a pretty forceful thing that says, \u2018But we\u2019re not going to do anything about it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNenshi said that the federal government has tools at its disposal beyond joining a legal challenge, such as withholding federal funding or employing the rarely used power of disallowance to wipe out a provincial statute.\n\nKerri Froc, an assistant law professor at the University of New Brunswick, said the use of disallowance \u201cwould probably generate a constitutional crisis.\u201d A likelier though less powerful tactic, she said, would be a friend-of-the-court brief filed by the attorney general.\n\nRead more\n\nQuebec ban on religious symbols would fall heavily on hijab-wearing teachers\n\nCanada\u2019s Trudeau is down in the polls.
