Well done, it's fantastic.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"Scary! Amazing but really gives me the creeps.\"\n\nA third said: \"This is great... I mean I wouldn't be opening my door on Halloween night. Officially the creepiest child I have seen. Fab job!\"\n\nTurning film characters into Halloween costumes can often divide opinion, as Fashion Nova found out recently after shoppers said the brand's racy Toy- Story-inspired outfits were 'ruining childhoods' .\n\nThe American retailer created very revealing looks resembling Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the Pizza Planet aliens - and you'd have to be very brave to wear them.\n\nAlthough the costumes have proved to be a big hit as they continue to sell out fast, others were unhappy that their sacred childhood heroes had been given a sexy makeover.", "description": "The Pennywise costume is so good people said they would be running in the other direction if they saw her son on Halloween", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20695714.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pennywise.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
