After noticing what had happened he called the police, who soon arrived on the scene.\n\nOfficers took the woman to a hospital where an X-ray confirmed the ring was in her stomach.\n\nM.A. was then charged with theft and released on bail, even though the ring was still inside her.\n\nPolice say once nature has taken its course the woman will either have to return the ring to the shop, or pay for it. She also faces a fine or jail sentence.", "description": "She allegedly first tried to slip the ring in her pocket.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2160/0f81ab9297854da98c4b8cb8fffee46f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-01-05"}
