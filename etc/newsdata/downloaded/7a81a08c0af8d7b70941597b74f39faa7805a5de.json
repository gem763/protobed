The Gallup \u201cthought\u201d question has been asked in the year before a presidential election on only a few occasions, including 1979, 1999 and 2007. However, the 60% of all U.S. adults engaged in the presidential campaign at this time exceeds the percentages measured in any of those years, with the late 2007 measure (55%) the closest.\n\nThe current level of voter engagement also surpasses many historical election-year measures, particularly those before 2004.", "description": "", "authors": ["News.Gallup.Com Poll"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
