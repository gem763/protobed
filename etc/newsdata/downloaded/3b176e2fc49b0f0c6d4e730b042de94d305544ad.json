Films are films. Everybody doesn\u2019t like his stuff either,\u2019 he said, just channelling all the Nick Fury.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u2018Everybody\u2019s got an opinion, so I mean it\u2019s okay.\n\n\u2018Ain\u2019t going to stop nobody from making movies.\u2019\n\nMartin Scorsese isn\u2019t a Marvel fan (Picture: FADEL SENNA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nNo it won\u2019t.\n\nIt comes after Martin previously admitted he\u2019d tried and failed to enjoy the Marvel movies, which include money-spinning franchises like Infinity War and Endgame, Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nHe shared: \u2018I don\u2019t see them. I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema.\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks.\n\n\u2018It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nAvengers director Joss too has leapt into action this weekend, after GOTG director James also spoke his opinion on the matter.\n\nThe 55-year-old director \u2013 who helmed The Avengers in 2012 \u2013 initially tweeted Scorsese\u2019s statement, typing: \u2018It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, he discussed Martin\u2019s claims in reference to filmmaker James and the GOTG franchise.\n\nHe continued: \u2018I first think of @JamesGunn, how his heart & guts are packed into GOTG. I revere Marty, & I do see his point, but\u2026\n\n\u2018Well there\u2019s a reason why \u201cI\u2019m always angry\u201d. (sic)\n\nOver the weekend James said: \u2018Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers. I was outraged when people picketed The Last Temptation of Christ without having seen the film. I\u2019m saddened that he\u2019s now judging my films in the same way.\u2019\n\nHe went on to add: \u2018That said, I will always love Scorsese, be grateful for his contribution to cinema, and can\u2019t wait to see The Irishman.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
