FOREX-Dollar, pound steady as EU considers granting Brexit delay\n\n(Recasts, new throughout; adds analyst quotes; changes\n\ndateline, previous LONDON)\n\nBy Kate Duguid\n\nNEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - The dollar and British pound\n\nwere steady on Wednesday as European Union leaders consider\n\nBritain's request for a Brexit delay, and are expected to grant\n\na three-month extension to the Oct. 31 deadline for its\n\ndeparture.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter he\n\nhad recommended late on Tuesday that EU leaders back a delay.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson was forced by parliament to\n\nask for three months, but there is still a chance that some EU\n\ncountries, notably France, could demand a shorter extension.\n\nJohnson paused his bill to enact the Brexit deal he struck\n\nlast week with the European Union's 27 other member states,\n\nafter dramatic votes on Tuesday in which the British parliament\n\naccepted the deal in principle but rejected a three-day\n\ntimetable for passing the necessary legislation.\n\nForeign exchange trading was generally quiet following a\n\nsell-off Tuesday that saw the pound drop against both the dollar\n\nand the euro. Against the dollar, the pound was last down 0.02%\n\nto $1.287 . Against the euro, the pound was 0.8% stronger\n\nto 86.34 pence EURGBP= .\n\nThe dollar index was up 0.08% at 97.606 .\n\n\"With Brexit on ice for now, attention has shifted to the EU\n\nto see if indeed it grants the UK more time \u2013 likely three\n\nmonths or less. While weaker, the bottom hasn't fallen out of\n\nthe pound given that a no-deal Brexit has seemingly been taken\n\noff the table. Expecting the unexpected with respect to Brexit \u2013\n\nand sterling \u2013 remains a central theme,\" said Joe Manimbo,\n\nsenior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.\n\nJohnson did not follow through on his threat to pull the\n\ndeal if parliament defeated him on the timetable, which was\n\nunderstood by the market as all but eliminating the chances of\n\nno-deal exit.\n\n\"Things could change very quickly today, depending on the EU\n\nresponse,\" said Adam Cole, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets,\n\nadding, however, that he did not see much downside risk now that\n\na no-deal Brexit appeared to be ruled out.\n\nSafe haven currencies earlier Wednesday had been boosted by\n\nthe Brexit uncertainty. But after the EU was seen as likely to\n\napprove an extension, gains in the Japanese yen and Swiss franc\n\nfaded. The yen was last marginally lower at 108.55 per\n\ndollar, with the franc at 0.991 per dollar.", "description": "FOREX-Dollar, pound steady as EU considers granting Brexit delay", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB1M100_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
