Starbucks will be its first launch partner, in keeping with the partnership it unveiled when Bakkt was first announced. App users will be able to spend their bitcoins on coffee, via the app\u2014although they won\u2019t be making direct Bitcoin payments from the person to the store.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now focused on the development of the consumer app and merchant portal, as well as testing with our first launch partner, Starbucks, which we expect in the first half of next year,\u201d Bakkt chief product officer Mike Blandina said, in the blog post.\n\nBakkt was first unveiled in August, 2018, with partners Starbucks and Microsoft on board. Its plan is to create an open ecosystem for the crypto industry, providing a secure place for both consumers and institutions to store, send and receive bitcoins.\n\nSo far\u2014at least on its futures exchange\u2014Bakkt has only focused on just one cryptocurrency: Bitcoin. But with the upcoming consumer app, it appears that it will branch out to other coins.\n\n\u201cA key feature of the model we\u2019ve designed is to support a superset of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, as seamlessly as investors transact in stocks in a retail brokerage account,\u201d Blandina added.\n\nStarbucks owns almost 40 percent of the U.S. coffee market and has nearly 30,000 stores worldwide. Bakkt\u2019s pilot program hopes to tap into this market segment, bringing more people into the cryptocurrency space.\n\nWhile users of Bakkt\u2019s consumer app will be able to spend their bitcoins, they won\u2019t be making direct Bitcoin payments to Starbucks stores. When the platform was first announced, Starbucks quickly cleared this up, telling Quartz, \u201cIt is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks.\u201d\n\nBut from the user\u2019s perspective, it gives them a way to seamlessly spend their bitcoins, even if it\u2019s not the cypherpunk\u2019s dream. And that's a start.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Bakkt\u2019s upcoming consumer app for making Bitcoin payments will go live in 2020 with Starbucks as its first launch partner.", "authors": ["Decrypt Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JurnkEsqwXYMcvr2kn72Kw--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/1ae9f3618096ef131e1633b6219ff7cd", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
