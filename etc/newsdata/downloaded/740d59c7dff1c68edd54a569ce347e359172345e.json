Travis Boyd could be the answer.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nWith Capitals forward Evgeny Kuznetsov suspended the first three games of the season, Travis Boyd (72) could get an opportunity to center the third line. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post)\n\nTravis Boyd still had a year left on his contract with the Capitals when July 1 arrived, but the first day of NHL free agency still brought uneasiness. He had finally broken through to the big leagues last year, spending all of it in Washington \u2013 though not always in the lineup. This campaign was supposed to feature more stability, but then a trio of bottom-six forward signings spelled anything but.\n\n\u201cI'm not gonna lie and say I was happy seeing that. I mean, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cUltimately, I can read between the lines and see that the more people who were signing, that\u2019s just more people I need to beat out to have my job back and to stay up here full-time.\n\n\u201cI don't want to be in the situation I was in last year. I don't want to be going in and out of the lineup and playing three games, sitting for four, playing for two. I want to play every night. I think I\u2019ve proven last year that I can play in this league every night and my big thing this year is just trying to establish myself even more and become an everyday player.\u201d\n\nA first-round playoff exit last season left the Capitals underwhelmed with their depth, something they addressed with the free agent additions of Richard Panik, Garnet Hathaway and Brendan Leipsic. Panik is expected to slot in at third-line right wing, replacing Brett Connolly, who signed with the Florida Panthers on July 1, and with Nic Dowd presumably retaining his role as the team\u2019s fourth-line center, Hathaway and Leipsic are the frontrunners to play beside him. That means that after Boyd scored five goals with 15 assists in 53 games as a rookie, his job is in jeopardy.\n\n[Brendan Leipsic, on his fifth team since 2015-16, hopes to find a home with the Capitals]\n\nBut Boyd might now have a different way into the lineup to start the season. With center Evgeny Kuznetsov suspended the first three games for \u201cinappropriate conduct\u201d after testing positive for cocaine at the world championships in May, Washington will be temporarily shorthanded up the middle. Lars Eller will almost certainly move up to the second line, meaning the Capitals need a short-term solution for their third trio. Consider Boyd the favorite.\n\n\u201cYou never want to see [a suspension] happen, especially to a teammate, and I love Kuzy \u2013 one of the nicest guys in that locker room,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cBut I mean, from my standpoint of it, absolutely that's a chance \u2013 three games early in the year to hopefully get a chance to show what I can do. And if I get that chance, I\u2019ve got to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nWhile Boyd was used more on the wing down the stretch last season, he\u2019s a natural center, and the Capitals have turned to him for similar spot duty before. He even briefly centered a top line with captain Alex Ovechkin and Tom Wilson when Kuznetsov was injured two seasons ago. Coach Todd Reirden listed Garrett Pilon and Michael Sgarbossa \u2013 neither played in the NHL last year \u2013 as other possible third-line center options, as well as Connor McMichael, Washington\u2019s 18-year-old first-round pick in the most recent draft.\n\n\u201cThey understand the situation,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cThis is something that was discussed with all players that were involved, that there may be a suspension. \u2026 They have to be prepared to take advantage of any opportunity they get and showcase themselves. There\u2019s a number of players and a number of different directions we can go in.\u201d\n\n[Evgeny Kuznetsov, suspended after positive cocaine test, says, \u2018I\u2019m going to learn from this\u2019]\n\nBoyd\u2019s speedy skating creates offensive opportunities, but he went into the summer wanting to get stronger without slowing down. He said he gained roughly 10 pounds of \u201cgood weight,\u201d maintaining his body fat percentage while adding muscle so he wouldn\u2019t be pushed off the puck as often. That meant cutting out sugar all summer and opting for water while friends ordered beer.\n\n\u201cI mean, it's grown men [in the NHL], so if you're in the corner and going up against a 6-foot-3 [defenseman] who's 225 or 220 or even 215, it was tough for me for where I was at last year,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also struggled with faceoffs, winning just 36 percent of the 210 he took last year. In Washington\u2019s preseason opener against Chicago on Monday night, Boyd centered a first line with Wilson and Leipsic, and while he was officially credited with winning just three of nine draws, Reirden said the Capitals\u2019 internal metrics had him at above 50 percent. He also scored a power-play goal with a shot from the left faceoff circle, a role that\u2019ll be open on Washington\u2019s second unit after the departure of defenseman Matt Niskanen.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what he was able to show us last year \u2014 the ability to, when he was given the opportunity, convert,\u201d Reirden said.\n\nThat bodes well for Boyd in his audition to start the season as Washington\u2019s substitute center, a first crack at a lineup he doesn\u2019t intend to leave.\n\n\u201cLast year was a lot of learning experiences for me, just coming to the rink every day and practicing against these guys,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cAnd I think the one big thing for me is just my mentality and my attitude when I\u2019m at this rink now is just a little more comfortable, feeling a lot more settled in and confident around here. And I think that translates over to the ice and hoping that I can continue to carry that confidence through this training camp. And if I do that, everything will be well.\u201d\n\nRead more on the Capitals:\n\nCapital One Arena revises bag policy to ban backpacks of all sizes\n\nSvrluga: Evgeny Kuznetsov doesn\u2019t need our scorn.
