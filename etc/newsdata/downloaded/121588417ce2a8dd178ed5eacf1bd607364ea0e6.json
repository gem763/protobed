(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\nContributing columnist\n\nIt was no great surprise that a federal court Monday morning rejected President Trump\u2019s argument that, as a sitting president, he is immune even from being investigated by the Manhattan district attorney. Nor that the court of appeals swiftly granted a stay of the order, thus preserving its ability to hear an appeal.\n\nBut the district court\u2019s scathing assessment of the implications of Trump\u2019s argument is telling, and the tale it tells should greatly concern the White House in the looming impeachment battle.\n\nRecall that Trump brought the action in federal court to prevent Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. from subpoenaing Trump\u2019s accountants for his tax returns as part of Vance\u2019s criminal investigation. (This is the same case that the Justice Department recently entered, on behalf of Trump.)\n\nThe court\u2019s technical ruling Monday is that it would abstain from entering the fray based on a general court-made doctrine \u2014 it\u2019s known as the Younger abstention \u2014 that instructs federal courts not to meddle in pending state criminal prosecutions. Trump (and the Justice Department) had argued that fundamental questions of presidential immunity justified ignoring that doctrine here. The court\u2019s rejection of the president\u2019s position could not have been more emphatic.\n\nNotably, the 75-page opinion by U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero came just two weeks after oral arguments, blindingly fast by litigation standards. Its length and complexity suggest that the court was already working on the opinion from the time Trump filed his hyperaggressive claim.\n\nMost important, Marrero, who could have made quick and summary work of Trump\u2019s argument, went on at substantial length to explain just how lawless and brazen the position was.\n\nMarrero began the opinion by calling the president\u2019s claim \u201cextraordinary.\u201d Things went steeply downhill for Trump from there.\n\nHe wrote that Trump was asserting a constitutional shield from judicial process that was \u201cvirtually limitless,\u201d a notion of \u201cunqualified and boundless . . . presidential immunity that stands at direct odds with the framers\u2019 constitutional plan and the Supreme Court\u2019s precedents on executive immunity.\u201d\n\nMore: The president\u2019s position was \u201crepugnant to the nation\u2019s governmental structure and constitutional values.\u201d At its core, the court wrote, the argument reduces to the \u201cvery notion that the Founders rejected at the inception of the Republic.\u201d\n\nAnd all that in just the first eight pages of the opinion, which continues on to demonstrate, using Supreme Court case law and basic political theory and history, the fundamental arrogance and lawlessness of Trump\u2019s argument.\n\nTrump likely anticipated the ruling, and maybe even welcomed the opportunity to move the case to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, thereby eating up more time. The legal battle isn\u2019t over yet.\n\nBut this skirmish was a total rout for the president, and that matters for several reasons.\n\nFirst, there are similar pending actions involving the administration\u2019s general strategy of filing tenuous or meritless arguments to resist lawful testimony or producing documents. You can be sure that the courts in those actions will carefully read Judge Marrero\u2019s opinion here \u2014 which paves the way toward dismissive and incensed rejections of other outlandish arguments (e.g., the administration\u2019s insistence that former White House counsel Donald McGahn and former communications director Hope Hicks are protected by absolute immunity from even showing up in Congress).\n\nSecond, the quick work of the court indicates a judicial recognition of the urgency of resolving the administration\u2019s far-fetched claims. It\u2019s hard to see the court of appeals sitting on its hands for months after the lower court has made such a quick handoff.\n\nBut, most important, by far, is that the scathing language of the opinion bolsters the argument the House is developing for its second impeachment count, based on Trump\u2019s attempted stonewalling of the House\u2019s investigation. It is a major shot in the arm for that theory that the judicial branch has weighed in saying that Trump\u2019s legal strategy is brazen and bankrupt.\n\nThat strategy has stalled matters for a few months, but it\u2019s beginning to come home to roost.\n\nRead more:\n\nHarry Litman: Can the Justice Department actually block the Manhattan DA\u2019s subpoena of Trump\u2019s taxes?\n\nHarry Litman: The Justice Department is oddly incurious about potential criminality in the Trump-Ukraine mess", "description": "The strategy has stalled matters for a few months, but it\u2019s coming home to roost.", "authors": ["Harry Litman", "Contributing Columnist Focused On Legal Issues", "Contributing Columnist", "October At Pm", "A Washington Post Contributing Columnist", "Is A Former U.S. Attorney", "Deputy Assistant Attorney General.
