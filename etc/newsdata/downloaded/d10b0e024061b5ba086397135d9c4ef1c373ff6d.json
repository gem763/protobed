Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything I am and believe in.'\n\nRonaldo's girlfriend, 25-year-old Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez, stood by him throughout the claims.\n\nThe civil lawsuit, in which Mayorga sought more than $200,000 (\u00a3150,000) in damages, had been moved to federal court.\n\nRonaldo and his girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez who stayed by his side throughout the allegations\n\nPolice could not conduct 'any meaningful investigation' at the time because Ms Mayorga declined to say who assaulted her or where it occurred, U.S. prosecutors said.\n\nAs a result, detectives were 'unable to search for and impound vital forensic evidence,' and video showing Ronaldo and Mayorga together was lost, they added.\n\nMayorga contacted police in August of last year to ask that the case be reopened, at which point she named Ronaldo as the alleged assailant.\n\nHer lawyers have said she was inspired to speak out and make her claim public by the #MeToo movement against sexual harassment.\n\nRonaldo left Real Madrid in 2018 after nine seasons with the club, joining Italian champions Juventus.\n\nRonaldo in action for Juventus against Bologna in Turin on Saturday night\n\nWhile in Spain he became Real Madrid's highest ever goalscorer, netting 451 times after joining from Manchester United for a then-world record \u00a380million in 2009.\n\nHe helped Real win three consecutive Champions League titles in 2016, 2017 and 2018.\n\nRonaldo is also Portugal's most-capped player, with 158 appearances, and record goalscorer, with 88.", "description": "In a tranche of emails between police and prosecutors during the investigation, Las Vegas detective Jeffrey Guyer wrote: 'DNA is back and is a match,' a report claims.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/21/07/17513486-0-image-a-8_1566369185483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
