Mueller\u2019s team had not recommended he serve jail time, due to his cooperation with the government. Sullivan postponed the sentencing at Flynn\u2019s request so he could testify in the Rafiekian case, He never did, although his new attorneys stressed in the filing Monday. he was willing to do so.\n\nIn the ruling last week, a federal judge in Alexandria, Va., ruled that the evidence and testimony prosecutors introduced at Rafiekian\u2019s July trial was too weak to support the guilty verdicts a jury took less than four hours to return against the Iranian-American businessman on charges of acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Turkey in the U.S. and conspiring to file a false report with the Justice Department\u2019s Foreign Agent Registration Act office.\n\nProsecutors convinced jurors that Rafiekian knew he was acting on behalf of Turkey during the summer and fall of 2016 when the Flynn Intelligence Group accepted a $600,000 contract to shape the opinion of U.S. leaders and the American public to encourage to extradition to Turkey of a longtime Turkish dissident cleric who has lived in Pennsylvania for two decades, Fethullah Gulen.\n\nRafiekian\u2019s defense maintained that the work was actually done for a company owned by a Turkish businessman who was charged in the case but remains at large, Ekim Alptekin. Emails and Skype chats shown at the trial indicated that Alptekin said he was coordinating with the Turkish government.\n\nFlynn is now set for sentencing on Dec.18, but if Sullivan grants Flynn\u2019s demand for access to a slew of Mueller-related records, that hearing would almost certainly be postponed again.\n\nSpokespeople for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington and for Justice\u2019s National Security Division did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday night.\n\nHowever, a key prosecution response to Flynn\u2019s demand for extensive, wide-ranging additional disclosures about the Mueller investigation and other matters is due by noon Tuesday.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6f/c3/52e064934558bf7287b2b81232d2/190930-michael-flynn-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
