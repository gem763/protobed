The school will spend $1.7 million in reparations.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nIn 1841, slaves owned by a construction contractor built Aspinwall Hall, which now houses the administrative offices at Virginia Theological Seminary. (Library of Congress)\n\nFrom their offices in a building erected by slaves, leaders of the Virginia Theological Seminary announced early this month that they have created a $1.7 million fund for reparations, putting one of the oldest Episcopalian schools at the forefront of a movement among universities and other groups seeking to reconcile slavery\u2019s enduring legacy in their organizations.\n\nThe endowment fund offers a model at a time when lawmakers and presidential candidates are studying how reparations may work nationally. At Virginia Theological Seminary \u2014 a school that did not admit black students until 1951 \u2014 the plan involves more than just writing a check.\n\nThe pot of money will be used to address \u201cparticular needs\u201d of descendants of slaves who worked at the seminary, to create programs that \u201cpromote justice and inclusion,\u201d and to elevate the work and voices of African American alumni and clergy within the Episcopal Church, especially at historically black congregations.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the [the Seminary\u2019s] milestone of 200 years, we are deeply conscious of our past. ... Part of our past is explicit racism,\u201d the Rev. Ian S. Markham, dean and president of the seminary, said in a statement. \u201cWe were a Seminary where enslaved persons worked. We participated fully in segregation. So we apologize; so we commit to a different future; but we need to do more. This fund is our seed \u2014 the first step.\u201d\n\nVirginia Theological Seminary was founded in 1823 by several slaveholding men \u2014 including Francis Scott Key, who wrote the national anthem and who so opposed emancipation that he criminally prosecuted abolitionist journalists as U.S. attorney in the District. Key and the other religious founders supported the American Colonization Society, which advocated sending freed slaves back to Africa, according to the book \u201cNo Turning Back: The Black Presence at Virginia Theological Seminary.\u201d\n\nOn campus, slaves owned by a construction contractor built Aspinwall Hall in 1841, a red-brick building with a stately white tower, which now houses the seminary\u2019s administrative offices, a seminary spokesman told Living Church, a religious news site. When the seminary\u2019s archivist went looking for records of the school\u2019s role in slavery in 2006, she also found that Mount Vernon, George Washington\u2019s estate, rented slaves to work at the seminary in 1850s, and that early professors and Virginia bishops also owned slaves.\n\nRecords were limited and incomplete, the archivist reported. But there is also anecdotal evidence of slavery\u2019s impact from students in the 19th century who sympathized with the abolitionist movement \u2014 and were disturbed by the religious school\u2019s hostility to it. One member of the seminary wrote that the \u201c\u2018dear old seminary\u2019 was not a very comfortable place for the anti-slavery men, such as a few of us were.\"\n\nAnother student, Phillips Brooks from Boston, wrote in an 1856 letter home: \u201cOf course there is nothing of the brutality of slavery here [at the Seminary], but the institution is degrading the country just as much. All the servants are slaves. Those in the seminary are let out by their masters for so much a year, paid of course to the master just as you\u2019d pay for a horse hired.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how the seminary will go about identifying the direct descendants of slaves who worked on campus, although Curtis Prather, director of communications, told CNN the school intends to set up a task force.\n\nElsewhere, universities have also launched task forces to tackle reparations proposals and to track down descendants, and more than 50 have taken part in an initiative called Universities Studying Slavery.\n\nAt Georgetown University, students voted in April to create a reparations fund for the descendants of 272 slaves sold at auction in 1838 by Jesuits who founded the school. The measure proposes a fee of $27.20 per student starting in the fall semester of 2020, which would raise an estimated $400,000 to be distributed to charitable causes benefiting the descendants.\n\nAt the University of Virginia, a genealogist hired by the school began identifying and contacting descendants of a portion of the estimated 4,000 slaves who worked on campus from 1817 to 1865, typically rented out from other plantations, although the next steps are unclear, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.\n\nAnd at a hearing in June, lawmakers in Congress began studying the feasibility of reparations, too.\n\nMaryland\u2019s Episcopal Bishop Eugene Sutton was among those who testified before the House Judiciary subcommittee on the constitution, civil rights and civil liberties, supporting federal legislation that would create a commission to make reparations proposals. Sutton testified that the Episcopal Church formally apologized for its complicity in slavery in 2006 and, at that time, already started calling on Congress and all levels of the church to support reparations proposals \u2014 part of what led the seminary to its own reparations fund.\n\nSutton emphasized during his testimony that \u201cit is not just about monetary compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not the transfer of money from white people to black people,\u201d said Sutton, who said he is a descendant of slaves. \u201cIt is what this generation will do to repair the broken pieces of the racial mess we have all inherited from the past.\u201d\n\nCritics of reparations argue that a national proposal would be impractical and unfair, forcing white Americans to pay for the sins of the fathers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he opposes reparations because \u201cnone of us currently living are responsible\u201d for slavery.\n\nSutton said he was flooded with angry emails by viewers of \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight\u201d after the Fox News host asked him in an interview why he thought white people should feel \u201cguilty\u201d for the past.\n\n\u201cSadly, this is to be expected,\u201d Sutton said later. \u201cTalking about race issues in our nation has always been fraught with emotion, touching some of the deep recesses in our personal and collective psyche that many of us prefer to remain hidden. \u201d\n\nVirginia Theological Seminary expects to spend $70,000 a year from its reparations fund, the Rev. Joseph Thompson, director of the seminary\u2019s Office of Multicultural Ministries, told the Episcopal News Service. He said the initiative, which is fully funded, could be \u201ctransformative.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt opens up a moment for us to reflect long and hard on what it will take for our society and institutions to redress slavery and its consequences with integrity and credibility,\u201d he said in a statement.", "description": "\u201cWe were a Seminary where enslaved persons worked.
