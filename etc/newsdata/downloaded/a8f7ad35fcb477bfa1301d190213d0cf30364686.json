(Anna Moneymaker/The New York Times)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House\u2019s trenchant declaration to House impeachment investigators last week was unequivocal: No more witnesses or documents for a \u201ctotally compromised kangaroo court.\u201d\n\nBut just a week later, it has become clear that President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to stonewall the Democrat-led inquiry that has imperiled his presidency and ensnared much of his inner circle are crumbling.\n\nOne by one, a parade of Trump administration career diplomats and senior officials has offered a cascade of revelations. Those accounts have corroborated and expanded upon key aspects of the whistleblower complaint that spawned the impeachment inquiry into whether the president abused his power to enlist Ukraine to help him in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe latest disclosures came Wednesday, when a former top aide to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo offered an inside account of what he said was a demoralized State Department, where career diplomats were sidelined and others apparently were pressed to use their posts \u201cto advance domestic political objectives.\u201d In six hours of voluntary testimony, the former aide, Michael McKinley, told impeachment investigators that he quit his post as Pompeo\u2019s senior adviser amid mounting frustrations over the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of diplomats and its failure to support them in the face of the impeachment inquiry, according to a copy of his opening remarks.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats are set to hear from Gordon D. Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, a central figure in the president\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukraine. He is expected to testify that he learned that Trump did not intend to invite President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of Ukraine to a meeting in the Oval Office until Zelenskiy pledged to open an investigation that could benefit Trump\u2019s political fortunes \u2014 bolstering a central allegation in the inquiry that the president steered foreign policy for political gain.\n\nAnd Democratic lawmakers have directed William B. Taylor Jr., one of the top American diplomats in Ukraine, to appear before their committees next Tuesday, according to an official familiar with the investigation. Text messages produced as part of the inquiry suggest that Taylor was deeply uneasy about what he saw as an effort by Trump aides to use a $391 million package of security assistance as leverage over Ukraine for political favors, calling the notion \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nAll three are examples of what can happen when Congress secures cooperation from government witnesses in a rapidly moving investigation aimed at the president.\n\nThe White House has had more success blocking the release of documents tied to the case. But the president and his lawyers had hoped to use the power of his office to muzzle current and former diplomats and White House aides, arguing in presidential tweets and a lengthy letter to Democratic lawmakers Oct. 8 that their subpoenas are invalid and unenforceable.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump cannot permit his administration to participate in this partisan inquiry under these circumstances,\u201d wrote Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel.\n\nAnd yet the president has been unable to prevent it.\n\nJust since Trump declared war on the impeachment effort, three current and former senior State Department officials and a former top White House aide have testified for nearly 36 total hours, delivering to lawmakers a consistent narrative of how they were effectively pushed aside by allies of the president operating outside America\u2019s usual foreign policy channels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s partly because this shadow foreign policy that the president was running was so deeply offensive to people in his own administration who took pride in overseeing a professionally run and arguably exemplary policy in support of Ukraine,\u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J., a former State Department official involved in the inquiry. Referring to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, he added, \u201cAnd then to see the official policy undermined by this clownishly corrupt effort led by Rudy Giuliani on behalf of the president was just more than many people apparently could bear.\u201d\n\nRepublicans who control the Senate view the fast-building case as serious enough to begin preparing for the trial in their chamber that would follow impeachment by the House. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the majority leader, briefed fellow lawmakers over lunch Wednesday about how a trial would work, expressing his hope of conducting it speedily and completing it by the end of the year, people familiar with his remarks said.", "description": "WASHINGTON -- The White House's trenchant declaration to House impeachment investigators last week was unequivocal: No more witnesses or documents for a \"totally compromised kangaroo court.\"But just a week later, it has become clear that President Donald Trump's attempts to stonewall", "authors": ["Michael D.
