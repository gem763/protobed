REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nDavies said there were initial fears he would be ruled out of the tournament after some confusion over the scans on his left knee, before he was given the all clear by radiographers back in Britain.\n\n\u201cI am probably not where I want to be, which is quite frustrating, but I know I can go out there and do a job and that\u2019s all my goal is this week,\u201d Davies told the news website walesonline.co.uk.\n\n\u201cEveryone is banged up and you have to do everything you possibly can and leaving no stone unturned in your preparation to get yourself right for some of the biggest games in your career.\n\n\u201cHow I\u2019ve prepared I\u2019ve made sure I have every confidence in myself, everyone else has confidence in how I\u2019m performing on the training field.\u201d\n\nDavies suffered in the injury against Fiji in the pool phase and having had two serious knee injuries in the past he feared for the worst.\n\nHe feared missing the tournament after initial interpretation of the scan before radiographers in Britain told him there appeared to be no structural damage.\n\n\u201cOnce he said it doesn\u2019t look like there is too much damage the outlook was far better, so we could be a bit more aggressive with the treatment and the rehab,\u201d Davies added.\n\n\u201cIt reacted quite well.\u201d\n\nWhile he was named to face France in the quarter-final last week, he was a late withdrawal after his knee swelled in training and then again on the morning of the game when he did some testing.\n\n\u201cEveryone had worked too hard for me to go into the game selfishly just to play in a quarter-final,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe made a decision that it was probably best for the team if I didn\u2019t play.\u201d\n\nWhile several of the team\u2019s coaches were moving on after the tournament, Davies recognised that it could be the last chance for several in the Wales side to win a World Cup, with the centre among four who lost the 2011 semi-final to France.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to have another shot at a World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything has been put into this.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about what we can do and hopefully we get the job done.\u201d", "description": "Wales centre Jonathan Davies may not be at his fittest because of a knee injury but the 31-year-old is confident he would be able to play Sunday's Rugby World Cup semi-final against South Africa.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191026&t=2&i=1445162673&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9P096-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
