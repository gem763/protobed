Under his tenure at the Office of Management and Budget, for example, Mulvaney\u2019s deputies have preserved a policy that provides work permits to 100,000 spouses of H-1B visa-workers who are waiting for green cards.\n\nMulvaney\u2019s public endorsement is a partial win for Cuccinelli, who is the top official at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency.\n\nCuccinelli is reportedly competing for the job against Mark Morgan, who has worked as acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection since July 5.\n\nBoth men have been strong and clear supporters of Trump\u2019s effort to shift immigration policy in favor of ordinary Americans.\n\n\u201cThe president has made no secret of the fact that he believes immigration, first and foremost, is set up to work for America \u2014 that means economically and for the people here,\u201d Cuccinelli told reporters at an October 16 press breakfast organized by the Christian Science Monitor. But finding the right balance between helping Americans workers and American investors is a constant political dilemma, Cuccinelli said:\n\nIs there some perfect [balanced] target point in every industry? Maybe there is, but we\u2019re never going to be able to know it. So which side do you err on? And he has repeatedly emphasized how important it is to protect U.S. workers. Now\u2019s he been clear with me, as well, and you all have heard him say it: he wants to see economic growth and dynamism. And that means, you know, growing companies needing to fill slots. So we\u2019re just in a constant battle to balance those things.\n\nOn October 8, Morgan touted Trump\u2019s broad strategy to shut down migration through Mexico. \u201cThis represents the fourth month in a row of a steady decline in apprehensions; this is an unprecedented achievement,\u201d he said, adding\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example. Just four short months ago, our daily apprehensions were close to 5,000 [migrants], and today I just looked at it on my screen before I left my office: It is below 1,700. We went from over 19,000 people in custody just four short months ago, [down] to less than 4,000 [in custody].\n\nCuccinelli is backed by immigraiton reform groups, according to a Politico report:\n\nKen Cuccinelli checks two boxes for President Trump \u2014 style and substance,\u201d said RJ Hauman, government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which has been supportive of Cuccinelli in conversations with the White House. \u201cHe\u2019ll successfully manage the sprawling bureaucracy at DHS, push back against activist judges and, most importantly, continue implementing President Trump\u2019s immigration agenda.\n\nCuccinelli\u2019s pro-reform views would doom any chance that he could win the Senate\u2019s confirmation for the job of DHS Secretary. But Trump may try to find a legal workaround that would allow Cuccinelli to run the agency without getting Senate approval.", "description": "President Donald Trump's chief of staff told reporters that Ken Cuccinelli would make a good leader for the DHS.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/wi/ap/12/055273_trump-29268-ken-cuccinelli-acting-united-states-citizenship-immigration-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
