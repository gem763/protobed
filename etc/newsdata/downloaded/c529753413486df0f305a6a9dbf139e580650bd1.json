It asks that Congress members pass a bill that requires background checks on all gun purchases as well as a \u201cstrong Red Flag law\u201d that they say would allow courts to issue \u201clife-saving extreme risk protection orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese proposals are common-sense, bipartisan and widely supported by the American public. It is time for the Senate to take action,\u201d the letter said.\n\nSigners of the letter included the CEOs of well-known companies such as Twitter, Uber, Levi Strauss, Lyft, Pinterest, Reddit, Shutterstock and Yelp, as well as other lesser-known businesses.\n\nThe new push for stricter gun control laws comes after a wave of mass shootings in Texas, California and Ohio.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
