When publishers buy and then bury a story, it is known in the trade as \u201ccatch and kill\u201d \u2013 the title of Farrow\u2019s book.\n\nFarrow also alleges the former Enquirer editor now AMI executive Dylan Howard ordered reporters to get \u201cdirt on that bitch\u201d in reference to the actor Rose McGowan, who accused movie mogul Harvey Weinstein of raping her.\n\nHoward has denied the allegations and, as the Daily Beast disclosed, has hired lawyers on three continents to try to block publication of Farrow\u2019s book.\n\nWeinstein, who is set to go on trial on criminal rape charges in January, has also denied any non-consensual sexual activity.\n\nSpy games\n\nCatch and Kill describes in gripping detail the lengths to which Weinstein and his lawyers went to keep tabs on Farrow. Through the Israeli security firm Black Cube, they set a couple of undercover private detectives on the journalist\u2019s trail, staking out his Manhattan apartment and following him as he visited sources and editors.\n\nThe pair sat in a car monitoring his building for such long stretches of time that one had to resort to urinating in a bottle. Farrow can draw on such granular detail, he says, because one of the Black Cube agents felt so uncomfortable about surveilling a journalist that he secretly approached Farrow and told him everything.\n\nMatt Lauer rape allegations\n\nLauer, a huge star in the NBC News firmament as the anchor of the Today show, was fired in November 2017 for engaging in \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\u201d. Catch and Kill goes much further.\n\nAs we can now see, this was a company with a lot of secrets that were under threat of exposure Ronan Farrow on NBC\n\nIt alleges Lauer anally raped a young colleague, Brooke Nevils, at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014. Farrow has Nevils on the record.\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want\u201d it, she is quoted as saying.\n\nLauer has issued a long denial in which he has said the sexual encounter in Sochi, and the affair that ensued, was \u201cmutual and completely consensual\u201d.\n\nNBC News buckled under Weinstein pressure\n\nOne of the most striking elements of Farrow\u2019s book is that it joins up the dots of the #MeToo era to depict a vast web of intrigue designed to protect powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct. The allegations against Weinstein and Lauer connect in Catch and Kill through the alleged efforts by NBC News to kill Farrow\u2019s investigation.\n\nAccording to Farrow, the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim, told him six times to stop reporting the Weinstein story. The journalists goes on to allege that the move to stymie his story was made after NBC News came under siege from Weinstein.\n\nWhy did NBC News cave in? Farrow reaches a clear conclusion in his book \u2013 he alleges it was anxious about allegations emerging relating to its own star, Lauer.\n\n\u201cAs we can now see, this was a company with a lot of secrets that were under threat of exposure,\u201d he told NPR this week.\n\nThe day I confronted Harvey Weinstein: \u2018He said, \"You think you can save everyone\"\u2019 Read more\n\nOppenheim and NBC News have stridently denied Farrow\u2019s portrayal of events.\n\n\u201cWe have no secrets and nothing to hide,\u201d the network\u2019s president wrote in a memo to staff, going on to accuse Farrow of a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d.\n\nFriends in high places\n\nCatch and Kill explores how Weinstein managed to continue to operate despite many years of sexual allegations against him. One explanation it offers is the producer\u2019s overwhelming Rolodex of connections.\n\nAmong those connections were Hillary Clinton, who Farrow describes as cancelling an interview with him on grounds, he was told by a Clinton aide, that \u201cwe know about the big story you\u2019re on \u2026 it\u2019s a concern for us.\u201d The aide has denied there was any significance to the cancellation.\n\nFarrow also describes a conversation with the renowned news anchor Tom Brokaw. Brokaw was at first supportive of Farrow\u2019s mission, but when he learned the subject of the probe was Weinstein said: \u201cI have to disclose, Ronan, that Harvey Weinstein is a friend.\u201d\n\nThe author also talks about his relationship with Lisa Bloom, a lawyer with a reputation for representing women in sexual harassment and assault cases. Farrow worked closely with Bloom, but he relates how he discovered that she was passing information about his investigation direct to Weinstein, a sometime client.\n\nIn an interview with Pod Save America, Farrow called Bloom a \u201cdouble agent\u201d. He said he confronted her and said she had promised not to tell Weinstein\u2019s people. Bloom\u2019s reply, according to Farrow: \u201cOh Ronan, I am his people\u201d.\n\nLast month, Bloom apologised for \u201cthe colossal mistake I made working for Weinstein\u201d.", "description": "Farrow\u2019s new book Catch and Kill draws in many powerful figures in politics and media \u2013 and offers shocking revelations", "authors": ["Ed Pilkington"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c41a7cc64ff3477e1e96de8748b2a561f968bfb8/0_51_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f28cc413a59ecae72294027c0c889d63", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
