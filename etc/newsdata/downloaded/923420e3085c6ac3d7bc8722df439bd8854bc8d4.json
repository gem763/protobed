Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday commemorated \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day\u201d in place of Columbus Day and claimed America has a \u201clong and painful\u201d history of mistreating Native Americans.\n\nThe DC Council approved of the \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day Emergency Declaration Act of 2019\u201d last week, which temporarily replaces Columbus Day with \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day\u201d in the city this year. However, it is not a permanent measure:\n\nCouncil member David Grosso said last week:\n\n\u201cColumbus Day was officially designated as a federal holiday in 1937, despite the fact Columbus did not discover North America, despite the fact millions of people were already living in North America upon his arrival to the Americas, and despite the fact Columbus never set foot on the shores of the current United States. \u2026 Columbus enslaved, colonized, mutilated, and massacred thousands of Indigenous People in the Americas.\n\nWarren, who falsely claimed Native American heritage throughout her academic career, embraced the temporary replacement.\n\n\u201cThe story of America\u2019s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient,\u201d Warren wrote.\n\n\u201cWe owe them our respect\u2014and we must honor our government\u2019s commitments and promises to them,\u201d she added with the hashtag, \u201c#IndigenousPeoplesDay\u201d:\n\nThe story of America\u2019s mistreatment of indigenous peoples is long and painful. And yet, Native communities have proven resilient. We owe them our respect\u2014and we must honor our government's commitments and promises to them. #IndigenousPeoplesDay \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019\n\nWarren also provided a link to her extensive plan focused on \u201chonoring and empowering tribal nations and Indigenous peoples\u201d:\n\nWe must fulfill our trust and treaty obligations to Tribal Nations. We must protect Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. And we have to go even further to empower indigenous peoples to build stronger communities and a brighter future. https://t.co/WKMjPKTvDu \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 14, 2019\n\nThe presidential hopeful unveiled her comprehensive plan to \u201cempower\u201d tribal nations in August, which included key pieces from her other plans. She promised to expand federally protected land, sign a \u201cset of executive orders to hold private contractors accountable for pay equity,\u201d and provide Medicare for All.\n\nWarren has faced scrutiny for falsely claiming Native American heritage in the past. The results of her DNA test made public last year showed that she possessed between 1/64th and 1/1,024 Native American ancestry (or between 0.1 percent to 1.56 percent). The results called her past claims of Native American heritage \u2013 Cherokee heritage, specifically \u2013 into question.\n\nNot only had Warren identified as a minority professor for years, she also claimed Native American heritage on her Texas Bar registration card and once cited her high cheekbones as proof of her native roots. A clip of an interview from 2012 shows the presidential hopeful telling a reporter that she had pictures proving her Native American family history, but she refused to show them.\n\n\u201cI have plenty of pictures. They\u2019re not for you,\u201d Warren told the reporter:\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Warren\u2019s DNA results did not show a direct association with Native American tribes in the U.S., further debunking her claims of Cherokee heritage.\n\nWarren has failed to explain why she went so many years claiming minority status without checking her family history, but she has since admitted that she is \u201cnot a citizen of a tribe\u201d and issued a general apology for making what she described as a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike anyone who\u2019s been honest with themselves, I know that I have made mistakes,\u201d Warren said at the Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa, in August. \u201cI am sorry for harm I have caused.\u201d\n\nWarren will join 11 other candidates on the debate stage at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, on Tuesday evening. The Massachusetts senator\u2019s false claims of Native American heritage have yet to become a topic of conversation at any of the primary debates.", "description": "Warren commemorated \"Indigenous Peoples' Day\" in place of Columbus Day and claimed America has a \"long and painful\" history of mistreatment.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1162747786-1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
