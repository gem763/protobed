Or does it mean that Al Qaeda still considers Afghanistan to be a primary safe haven that we would be foolish to leave?\n\nI tend to favor the first view \u2013 less because of any particular importance that Hamza bin Laden had for Al Qaeda operations, but more because that while Afghanistan has some symbolic meaning for the terrorist group, it is not uniquely suited as a terrorist incubator.\n\nThere are many places Al Qaeda terrorists can lurk to plan their barbaric acts. Al Qaeda differs from ISIS in not planting a flag and claiming territory to create a physical caliphate. Now that ISIS has seen its Islamic State dismantled, that group is also back to operating without governing territory.\n\nThe ability of Al Qaeda to continue finding sanctuary in Afghanistan depends largely on how much control the Taliban terrorist group may be able to gain in that nation in the event of a U.S. withdrawal. The Taliban share an Islamist extremist ideology with Al Qaeda and shielded Al Qaeda until the U.S. attacked the two terrorist groups following the 9/11 attacks.\n\nOur best military strategists, diplomats and specialists in civil governance have spent 18 years trying to turn Afghanistan into a peaceful democracy with a government friendly to the U.S. \u2013 and have failed.\n\nThe U.S. and allied Afghan and foreign forces deposed the Taliban government and enabled the people of Afghanistan to choose a new government in democratic elections. But the Taliban have kept fighting and U.S. forces have remained in Afghanistan to fight them for 18 years \u2013 making the continuing war in Afghanistan the longest in American history.\n\nThe main rationale advanced in favor of keeping U.S. military forces in Afghanistan is that a U.S. pullout would allow the Taliban to again take control of the country and create a safe haven for Al Qaeda. That could lay the groundwork for future attacks by Al Qaeda against the U.S. homeland. This is a legitimate concern.\n\nBut I don\u2019t think the U.S. needs to continue keeping our military presence in Afghanistan at its current level of about 14,000 troops for years or even decades. Instead, we should remove the bulk of our conventional forces and leave a robust group of intelligence collectors and special operations forces to locate the bad guys and take them out once we do.\n\nAugmented by our ability to conduct precision strikes against terrorist forces from the air, this counterterrorism strategy of a smaller U.S. presence in Afghanistan is better tailored to the reality on the ground there, and is one we can sustain for years.\n\nNo one has ever controlled all of the territory that is called Afghanistan in any meaningful way. It has always been a patchwork of tribes with grievances that go back thousands of years and a hellish terrain that makes it easy for small forces of fighters to stage ambushes.\n\nWe cannot change that reality \u2013 and no central Afghan government can either.\n\nOur best military strategists, diplomats and specialists in civil governance have spent 18 years trying to turn Afghanistan into a peaceful democracy with a government friendly to the U.S. \u2013 and have failed.\n\nIt\u2019s time to accept reality and strive for more a more limited objective \u2013 preventing Afghanistan from being used as a base to attack America again.\n\nWe owe it to all members of the U.S. military who have given their lives and suffered life-changing wounds in Afghanistan to do something new rather than continuing to try to achieve an impossible goal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe rules governing our counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan should be eased to give U.S. forces greater latitude to get the job done, and we should increase the amount of human intelligence gathering and spying.\n\nWe need to face facts and admit that the Afghanistan and Pakistan tribal regions will remain incubators for terrorism and extremism for years to come. We have learned that we cannot change that with sustained conventional military operations, despite the heroic efforts and sacrifices of members of our military and our allied forces\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut just because we can\u2019t achieve total victory in Afghanistan doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t achieve partial victory and ensure that terrorists never again attack America from Afghanistan.\n\nSuch a victory is within our grasp with our special operations forces and intelligence actions \u2013 including more successes such as permanently taking terrorists like Usama and Hamza bin Laden off the battlefield.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY JIM HANSON", "description": "The killing by U.S. forces of the son of former Al Qaeda leader Usama bin Laden \u2013 confirmed Saturday by President Trump \u2013 strikes a blow at attempts by the terrorist group to use him as a rallying point and create a dynasty of bin Laden family leadersh", "authors": ["Jim Hanson", "Jim Hanson Is President Of Security Studies Group", "Served In Us Army Special Forces."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/14/694940094001_6086277067001_6086279707001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
