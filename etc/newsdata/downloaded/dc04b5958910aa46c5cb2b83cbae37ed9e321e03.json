I\u2019m so f------ glad we got Osuna!\u201d\n\nHe was referring to Astros' closer Roberto Osuna who the team acquired from the Toronto Blue Jays in 2018 while he was in the middle of a 75-game suspension for violating the Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy.\n\nTaubman apologized Tuesday for his \u201cinappropriate language\u201d after other reporters backed up Apstein\u2019s report.\n\nIn its statement Thursday, the Astros said that its \"initial investigation led us to believe that Brandon Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were not directed toward any reporter.\"\n\nHowever, the Astros admitted that was wrong.\n\n\"We were wrong,\" the team said. \"We sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct. The Astros in no way intended to minimize the issues related to domestic violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccordingly we have terminated Brandon Taubman\u2019s employment with the Houston Astros. His conduct does not reflect the values of our organization and we believe this is the most appropriate course of action,\u201d the statement continues.\n\nThe team said it is \u201cvery committed to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nLast May, Osuna was charged with assault involving the mother of his child. Charges were dropped, but the Astros received criticism for their decision to trade for Osuna.", "description": "The Houston Astros fired assistant general manager Brandon Taubman on Thursday over comments he reportedly yelled at\u00a0female reporters after the team\u2019s victory in the American League Championship Series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/osunarobertoastros_102219getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
