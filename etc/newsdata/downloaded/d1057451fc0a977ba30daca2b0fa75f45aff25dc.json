No.'", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Congratulations are in order for Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger! The happy couple tied the knot on Saturday in Montecito, Calif. USA TODAY\n\nMicrowave: 1, Katherine Schwarzenegger: 0.\n\nChris Pratt shared an Instagram post Saturday night teasing his wife of four months for her failed attempt at heating up some frozen food.\n\n\"Proud of my darling for trying to cook tonight,\" Pratt wrote. \"Did it go well? No. No it did not. Not at all. To quote Rocky Balboa, 'It\u2019s not how many times you get knocked down, it\u2019s how many times you get up ... and keep moving forward.' As you can tell from the lump of coal in the center of the plate, this bagel bite never stood a chance.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I honestly simply cannot imagine what went wrong here. Pretty simple. Microwave. 2 minutes. Maybe she thought it said 2 hours. But I want to commend her for her effort. This is a big step babe. Proud of you.\"\n\nPatrick Schwarzenegger chimed in, commenting to tease his older sister: \"Smh @katherineschwarzenegger,\" he wrote.\n\nPratt and Schwarzenegger tied the knot June 7 in Montecito, California. Pratt's young son, Jack, and Schwarzenegger's parents, Maria Shriver and Arnold Schwarzenegger, were in attendance.\n\nPratt, 40, rose to fame in NBC's series \"Parks and Recreation\" before movie stardom came calling, thanks to roles in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Jurassic World\" franchises. Schwarzenegger, 29, is an author and lifestyle blogger.\n\nThe \"Parks and Recreation\" alum popped the question in January, months after the pair had people guessing if they were an item when they were spotted together in June 2018.\n\nPratt was previously married to Anna Faris, Jack's mother, from 2009 to 2018.\n\nContributing: Andrea Mandell and Erin Jensen, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/20/chris-pratt-trolls-katherine-schwarzenegger-over-cooking-fail/4046657002/", "description": "Microwave: 1, Katherine Schwarzenegger: 0.\u00a0Chris Pratt teased his wife of four months over a failed attempt at heating up some frozen food.", "authors": ["Hannah Yasharoff", "Published P.M.
