In \u201cDucks, Newburyport,\u201d her 1,034-page novel, Ellmann\u2019s narrator, an Ohio housewife, lets loose an encyclopedic monologue that encompasses modern motherhood; the American health care system; Trump, the tainted water in Flint, Mich.; \u201cthe fact that the average teen checks their phone two thousand times a day;\u201d Marie Kondo; and the plot of \u201cLittle House on the Prairie,\u201d and other subjects.\n\nThe book consists mostly of a single, breathless \u2014 and utterly compelling \u2014 sentence.\n\n\u201cDucks, Newburyport\u201d has been shortlisted for the Booker Prize; other finalists include Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie. Ellmann, whose previous (much shorter) books include the novels \u201cSweet Desserts\u201d and \u201cMimi,\u201d prefers not to think of the prize in competitive terms.\n\nBy email from her home in Scotland, the 62-year-old novelist offered some insights on her book \u2014 and how to read it.\n\nQ: Your narrator is a mother of four who runs a baking business out of her home in Ohio and sometimes breaks into song but rarely stops to catch her breath. What is she trying to tell us?\n\nA: She\u2019s not trying to tell you anything; she\u2019s just going about her business. \u201cDucks, Newburyport\u201d doesn\u2019t yank at a reader\u2019s coat tails like \u201cThe Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\u201d (a book I love). Its approach is oblique, and it\u2019s up to the reader to make head or tail of it.\n\nIt\u2019s an approximation of consciousness, two consciousnesses actually \u2014 those of an American woman and a mountain lion. It follows the woman\u2019s turns of thought, her associations, dreams, regrets. It seems to me the most interesting thing in the world, to find out what someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 is really thinking.\n\nSometimes the narrator tries to steer her thoughts in directions she prefers, or recoils from certain darker avenues of thought, but she can\u2019t keep it up for long. The bad thoughts will creep in, the mean thoughts, sad thoughts, crazy thoughts. We are all helpless amid this constant onslaught of the mind. Even when we\u2019re asleep, we\u2019re still thinking. Sounds, flashbacks, snatches of song, sights, smells and other sensations (cold, hunger, itches) all come into it. I wish novels had Smell-O-Vision, or even better, John Waters\u2019s Odorama, which included a lot of useful unromantic smells.\n\nQ: Some may think writing a one-sentence, thousand-plus-page book is gimmicky. What\u2019s your response?\n\nA: I would die before I used a gimmick. The thing in art is to find the correct form. The word \u201cgimmick\u201d belittles that effort, it belittles art.\n\nQ: If you could have written a second sentence, what would it have been?\n\nA: Ha. Great question. The second sentence can perhaps be written after Bernie Sanders becomes president. It would go something like this: \u201cLet\u2019s all get together and fix this mess.\u201d\n\nQ: You have lived outside the U.S. since you were a teen. And yet you chose to write in the voice of an American housewife/entrepreneur. Why \u2014 and how \u2014 did you summon that voice?\n\nA: She\u2019s not an \u201centrepreneur,\u201d more like a beggar who\u2019s just trying to make ends meet (the family has been crippled by health-care costs). I know something about the freelance life myself. Not baking, but writing. It\u2019s unreliable, and isolating. (But often quite satisfying.)\n\nThe narrator is in some ways the person I might have been, had I never moved to Europe. But anyway, I never really left the U.S. in my head. Marrying an American reinforced my American affiliations, even my accent. My husband and I had both lived in Britain for years, but pairing up seemed to consolidate our Americanness. Brits born after we ourselves arrived in Britain now rush to explain the U.K. to us.\n\nI have family in America, and dear friends. The country\u2019s fate concerns me. It concerns the whole world! America\u2019s always in your face. We were in France when Obama was elected and people treated us to champagne. For breakfast! Everyone hoped it would mean an end to war. Huh, fat chance.\n\nIt matters to everybody what America does. And from the outside the horrors are blatant. It is an obtuse entity, endangering the whole world. Why the hell can\u2019t it learn to know itself?\n\nQ: Your book offers a very complicated look at motherhood. At one point your narrator says, \u201cI\u2019m scared of all young women now, because when I look at them I see another potential mother-hater, the fact that I always wonder now how they treat their own moms.\u201d What are you trying to say about how society \u2014 and women in particular \u2014 view motherhood?\n\nA: I\u2019m not trying to say anything, I\u2019m saying it! I\u2019m kind of stunned by how harshly many daughters treat their mothers these days. This is gratingly anti-feminist, a self-perpetuating cycle of self-hatred, whereby these girls in turn will be scorned by their daughters. It is a sign of disunity, just when we need unity.\n\nThe devaluing of motherhood, though, is essential to patriarchy. Our society neglects mothers (practically and emotionally) and even the notion of motherhood. Freud has been exploited as another excuse to distrust mothers. This all serves misogyny extremely well.\n\nNot all women are mothers, luckily \u2014 what is the point of bearing children, after all, in such a world? What is the point of adding to consumption when what we need to do is pull back? But contempt for motherhood surges up from a well of disparagement of women in general, and the whole history of womanhood, a disparagement of life itself.\n\nI don\u2019t like overpopulation, but I have infinite respect for motherhood as a fact, an astounding fact throughout human history and the natural world. It\u2019s hard not to believe that the perspective of mothers is more rational and more considerate than many other perspectives. I agree with Tsutomu Yamaguchi, who said only nursing mothers should have control over nuclear bombs.\n\nIf it had been up to mothers, though, bombs would never have been created.\n\n[Reading \u2018Ducks, Newburyport\u2019 is mentally taxing \u2014 and physically exhausting]\n\nQ: How do you feel being compared toVirginia Woolf?\n\nA: Honored, if undeserving. I haven\u2019t read enough of Woolf\u2019s fiction yet. I\u2019ve concentrated more on her essays. I\u2019m particularly keen on Three Guineas. People have mentioned \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d a lot lately in connection with my novel, but it was not a conscious influence, as I haven\u2019t read it yet. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\n\nQ: David Foster Wallace?\n\nA: Never read him, so I can\u2019t tell what that means.\n\nQ: James Joyce?\n\nA: Thrilled. But again, to me the connection seems remote. Many reviews have mentioned that my father was a Joyce scholar. Actually, my sister\u2019s one too. But . . . I\u2019m not! My father did talk a lot about Joyce when I was growing up, when my mother didn\u2019t put her foot down. But mostly, I tuned it out. I regret that now \u2014 especially when people come to me with their Joyce questions!\n\nStill, I think it\u2019s weird for reviewers to bring up what my father did for a living. How often is the parentage of male novelists in their 60s mentioned?\n\nQ: Your book repeats the phrasing \u201cthe fact that . . . ,\u201d as it spins out a litany of facts including \u201cthe fact that there\u2019s maybe too much emphasis on facts these days, or maybe there are just too many facts.\u201d Is this a critique of the Web? Or a backhanded critique of Trump (who also appears in your book)?\n\nA: In my book \u201cthe fact that\u201d is a plaintive refrain, and a technique meant to generate suspense. \u201cDucks\u201d is not a conglomeration of facts \u2014 this \u201clitany\u201d is a way of diving beneath the dead zone of facts to a more personal realm.\n\nQ: I\u2019ve read that you are \u201ccommitted to peacefully circumventing all governments in order to create a worldwide matriarchy in which women, art and animals will be honored, instead of bombs, steak, cigars, man caves, computers, gangster movies and garter belts.\u201d Which thing will go first and how?\n\nA: We can do this the easy way or the hard way. My plan is that men should admit culpability in ruining the world, and in reparation hand over all their money and property to women. Whatever women do with the money, it\u2019s got to be better than what men spent it on. Once all wealth is in female hands, women can start sorting out the criminal catastrophe men have perpetrated.\n\nAdvances in metallurgy sparked the demise of matriarchy in the first place, 5,000 years ago, leading to a growth of weaponry and war. You can still see the link between weapons and misogyny today, in the number of American women shot by gun-toting men. So maybe we\u2019ll start by banning metal. Also porn. But men can still have beer.\n\nQ: Since we are having this conversation in writing, I don\u2019t know if you are loquacious or succinct. Do you talk as much as your narrator thinks?\n\nA: No.\n\nQ: Did your book editor try to shorten the book?\n\nA: Far from it. Galley Beggar Press and Biblioasis were both wholly supportive of this book from the beginning. In the final stages, I worked most directly on it with my British publishers, Galley Beggar (who brought the book out first, a few months ahead of Biblioasis\u2019s edition for the U.S. and Canada). During one revision I added 30,000 words. Not intentionally, it just happened! There wasn\u2019t a murmur from Sam Jordison and Elly Millar at Galley Beggar. Maybe they\u2019d fainted.\n\n[Praise be: Margaret Atwood has published a sequel to \u2018The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019]\n\nQ: As of this writing, you have one comment on Amazon that says \u201cHow the hell is one supposed to read this? My eyes would fall out of my head.\u201d What advice would you offer?\n\nA: Don\u2019t read it \u2014 that sounds pretty awkward. But what\u2019s the big deal, you know, if you\u2019re a real reader? How many books do people read in a year? \u201cDucks\u201d is equivalent in length to four moderately sized novels. So it takes four weeks, not one. Many people have read it in a week, I hear. For me, it takes a month and a half \u2014 but I\u2019m a slow reader.\n\nQ: How many people do you expect will begin your book?\n\nA: As many as want to.\n\nQ: Finish it?\n\nA: All of them. One English reviewer claimed only 2 percent of people (besides himself) would understand the book. My own estimation is that everyone can understand it, give or take a few babies.\n\nQ: Are we dwelling too much on your book\u2019s length and heft?\n\nA: Yes. The length is a necessary adjunct to what I wanted to get across, and the way I wanted to do that. Conventional narrative techniques and dutiful compression would not have suited this project. It had to be long. I\u2019d prefer to talk about content.\n\nCan I say that I also suspect it would not be such an issue if I were not female? Men can take liberties; a woman writing a long book is considered audacious, if not outrageous. Our novels, like us, are supposed to be petite. So many male reviewers have complained about this book\u2019s size that I fear male upper body strength may not be all it\u2019s cracked up to be. But come on, guys, it\u2019s just a novel, not 7,000 volumes of Wikipedia.\n\nNora Krug is an editor and writer at Book World.", "description": "\u2018Ducks, Newburyport\u2019 is a 1,000-plus page female monologue.
