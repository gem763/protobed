Yet in another episode, you will be led to think about the societal impact of business on society and vice versa, including what dematerialization impacts the economy or how African-Americans [advance] at work.\"\n\nHe added that he frequently finds himself recommending it to other professionals. \"[T]here is always \u2014 at least \u2014 one of their 700+ episodes that comes to mind when discussing a specific topic,\" Cl\u00e9ment said. \"You simply cannot go wrong with this podcast.\"\n\n2.

Safe For Work by Wondery\n\nLauren Miller, leadership coach for MBA students at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business and adjunct faculty at the Integrated Innovation Institute, stated that workplace-oriented podcast options \"tend to be overwhelmingly saturated in technology and entrepreneurship topics, and are often based on either pop trends or very specific research in management science.\"\n\nLauren Miller. Courtesy of Lauren Miller\n\nBut she identified Safe For Work as one of the few podcasts that she \"listen[s] to, scribble[s] notes about, and re-listen[s] to whenever [she] feel[s] a little unfocused.\"\n\n\"Liz Dolan, former CMO at Nike, leads this podcast about real-life workplace issues such as navigating networking events for introverts, resume solutions for gaps in employment, how to create better work meetings, and bouncing back from a work failure,\" Miller explained. \"[It's] very conversational in nature and an easy listen. They take a cheeky approach and aren't afraid to 'call a spade a spade' when it comes to workplace frustrations.\"\n\nShe added that since the Safe For Work podcasts are about 20 to 25 minutes in length, they're \"perfect for a morning commute.\"\n\n4. Coaching For Leaders by Dave Stachowiak\n\n\"Dave Stachowiak is a master at interviewing business leaders and getting to their kernels of truth,\" said Miller.

And the willingness of people who are the top of their game to give a roadmap as to how they got there, truly can't be found anywhere else.\"\n\nJan-Christopher Nugent. Courtesy of Jan-Christopher Nugent\n\nFor Nugent, \"a podcast has to be not only insightful but also entertaining.\"\n\nIn describing why The Tim Ferris Show fits this bill, Nugent said that \"sometimes the best new idea comes from someone outside of your field. [Ferris'] guests include CEOs, athletes, and entertainers, and [he] not only gives business acumens but also daily routines, books, and other habits that contributed to their success.\"\n\n7. Perpetual Traffic by DigitalMarketer\n\nNugent also gave a plug for Perpetual Traffic as another podcast that he listens to regularly.\n\n\"The hosts are enthusiastic, and I can compare what they are seeing in the broader marketplace \u2026 against what my company's clients are experiencing to create actionable tactics,\" he said.\n\n8.

Freakonomics Radio by Stitcher\n\n\"Freakonomics is a great listen for any individual in business or with strategy ambitions,\" said Markson. \"It's a good reminder of the wild and often unthinkable connections there can be between seemingly unrelated things.
