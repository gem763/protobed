There\u2019s more at their fingertips - the division-leading Cardinals lost again on Wednesday, slicing their lead over the Brewers to 1\u00bd games.\n\nMilwaukee trails Washington by one game for the wild card lead.\n\nThe Brewers jogged onto the field and formed a scrum by second base after when Junior Guerra got Christian Colon on a grounder for the final out.\n\nDETROIT (AP) - The decade of the 2010s will end the way it started - with the Minnesota Twins atop the AL Central.\n\nLuis Arraez and Eddie Rosario homered, and Randy Dobnak allowed one hit in six sparkling innings to lead Minnesota to a 5-1 win over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night. The Twins later clinched the division title when Cleveland lost to the White Sox in Chicago.\n\nIt\u2019s the first division title for Minnesota since 2010 and will be only its second postseason appearance since then. The Twins (98-60) have their highest victory total since the 1970 team also won 98 games.\n\nMinnesota wrapped up its win over the Tigers well before the Chicago-Cleveland game ended. That game was on television in the Minnesota clubhouse, where the Twins ate, played cards and waited calmly for a possible celebration.\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.
