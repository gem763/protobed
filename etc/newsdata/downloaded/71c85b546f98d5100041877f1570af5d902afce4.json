Sept. 11, 2001, was, after all, when nearly 3,000 people died at the hands of terrorists in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania -- not the stuff of glib drink salesmanship.\n\n\"Your previous caption was absolutely disgusting and you can edit it but it doesn\u2019t delete screenshots,\" one commenter said on Instagram.\n\nAnother said, \"So insensitive -- you don\u2019t celebrate that day, you remember.\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a time for jokes, sarcasm, and satire. But on the anniversary of a terrorist attack that killed thousands of Americans and traumatized just about the entire country...?\" yet another person wrote. \"If this caption would have said in 'remembrance of' or something along those lines, I would have been sold. You wouldn\u2019t have even had to promise proceeds to an organization. But to mock this tragedy?\"\n\nKRISTIN CAVALLARI'S 9/11 TRIBUTE SLAMMED AS 'INSENSITIVE' AND 'TONE DEAF'\n\nThe bar owner, identified by the Akron Beacon Journal as Chris Sedlock, told the publication, \"Isn\u2019t capitalizing on tragedy the American way?\"\n\nSedlock said he didn't intend for the post to go viral.\n\n\"I'm the kind of person that what you see if what you get,\" he told the Journal. \u201cWhen do you have the right to talk about it? ... They don\u2019t see this as irony. I see the irony in it. It\u2019s dark humor.\"\n\nILHAN OMAR SLAMMED ON 9/11 ANNIVERSARY BY VICTIM'S SON AFTER 'SOME PEOPLE DID SOMETHING' QUOTE\n\nHis bar's Instagram account has just over 1,000 followers. The viral post has just 43 likes.\n\nThe account posted an Instastory early Thursday, showing bar patrons taking shots alongside a caption: \"Cheers to 'all publicity is good publicity.'\"\n\nCritics expressed all sorts of reasons for blasting the Karma Kafe's offering.\n\n\"Seriously? What next? Trail of tears martinis?\" one commenter asked on the Sept. 11 post. \"That's kinda gross.\"\n\nOthers called the move to capitalize on 9/11 in such fashion \"unprofessional and careless,\" branding the establishment \"scum\" and an \"embarrassment.\"\n\n\"Might I suggest in the future you find someone else to run your social media because the current person does not appear to know what they are doing,\" a user suggested.\n\n\"Can\u2019t wait until you close,\" someone added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "An Ohio bar is facing national outrage after posting \"the 9/11 shot\" as the special of the day on Sept. 11, according to reports.", "authors": ["Melissa Leon"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/Shot.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
