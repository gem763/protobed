Which do you want to hear first?\n\nGoat: Let\u2019s hear the good news.\n\nChicken: OK, the good news is that humans are developing laboratory-made meat \u2013 which can be called cheat meat, or guilt-free meat, which in taste and texture is exactly like the real thing \u2013 which means that we won\u2019t have to be killed for humans to eat.\n\nGoat: Wow! That is good news. I\u2019ve never been able to figure why humans have to go around killing us for food. I mean we, you and I, don\u2019t go around killing humans so we can eat, do we? Anyway, if thanks to guilt-free cheat meat humans stop killing us they can get on with their main preoccupation, which seems to be killing each other, in wars, and riots, and terrorist attacks. So what\u2019s the bad news?\n\nChicken: The bad news is that because of guilt-free cheat meat a lot of veggie humans could well become non-veggies without feeling bad about our being killed.\n\nGoat: I don\u2019t get it. Why is it bad news if veggie humans become non-veggies and start eating guilt-free cheat meat?\n\nChicken: Figure it out. Look at what has happened to our fellow inmates in Animal Farm, the poor cows. Ever since these gau rakshaks stopped humans from eating them or turning them into leather, once a cow stops giving milk it\u2019s human owners leave it to live on a diet of plastic bags or starve to death.\n\nGoat: Uh, oh. I think I can see where this is going, and it isn\u2019t anyplace good.\n\nChicken: It isn\u2019t. If humans don\u2019t need to eat us because they can eat cheat meat instead, they\u2019ll have no further use for us and leave us to our fate, which in my case means I won\u2019t even get the chickenfeed which is all I get to eat right now. And the ghas-phoos you\u2019re given to eat might become more phoos than ghas.\n\nGoat: So whether or not we meat our end, we\u2019ll meet our end anyway\u2026.", "description": "Under a large sign saying ANIMAL FARM, a goat and a chicken are discussing their future, which doesn\u2019t seem too bright.
