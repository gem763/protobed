Everyone was a mixture of hope and nerves. Arriving back in the courtroom, the judge began to speak. I don\u2019t speak Polish so I couldn\u2019t really understand. Other than his voice, there is not a sound, as though everyone was holding their breath.\n\nI arrived in the Polish capital a few days ago, thinking that I would be attending one of several hearings in the case against 14 women who stood up to fascism in Poland in 2017. But now it seems this will be the most important hearing of them all: the hearing that decides if they are guilty of interfering with a lawful assembly, simply for protesting against hate. It is almost a year to the day since I first met this group of courageous women. They talked me patiently through the details of the unforgettable November evening when they took a stance against fascism.\n\nThis case started with injustice but has finished with justice, and a message that fascism and hatred will not be tolerated in Poland. Catrinel Motoc Senior campaigner at Amnesty International\n\nIt was 11 November 2017 at the Independence Day march in Warsaw. For some years now this annual event, organised to mark Poland\u2019s independence, had been tainted by the presence of some nationalist groups advocating \u201cEurope will be white or deserted,\u201d displaying racist and fascist symbols, while marching holding flares and throwing firecrackers on the streets of Warsaw. In 2017, these women decided it was time to act.\n\nAs they unfurled a banner reading \u201cFascism Stop,\u201d their peaceful protest against hate caused fury among the marchers. Video footage shows people reacting by kicking, spitting and screaming at them. They were called \u201csluts,\u201d \u201clefty scoundrels\u201d and \u201cwhores.\u201d They were pushed, jostled, grabbed by the neck and dragged onto the pavement, suffering bruises and cuts. One of the women lost consciousness after being dropped on the ground and needed medical help.\n\nThe authorities initially closed the investigation into the attacks with an absurd justification. But after the women appealed in February 2019, a judge ordered the investigation into the violence to be re-opened. However, adding insult to injury, the women were themselves charged with obstructing a lawful assembly and fined. And so their battle for justice began. This fight was not only for themselves, but for the hundreds - if not thousands - of protesters who have faced a similar fate after denouncing human rights violations at rallies across Poland.\n\nNearly two years later, here we are at this courthouse in Warsaw. At 1pm, some of the women appeared in front of the judge. Then two witnesses were called: a police officer and a steward of the march. In their words, I recognised details of the night in question; the aggression the women faced, the kicks, the insults, the police arriving only after being called by the women themselves; ambulances giving aid to one of them after she lost consciousness, the women trying to denounce the violence against them and instead ending up as the accused.\n\nI looked at the women and I saw a mix of courage and nervousness on their faces. But who wouldn\u2019t feel the same? We all wondered how this case will finish. As their defence lawyer gave his closing speech, I remembered him telling me almost a year ago: \u2018I cannot believe that in Warsaw, a city that was raised to the ground during the [1944] Warsaw Uprising by fascists, there will be a time when fascists will march in the city centre and someone will be found guilty for trying to stop them.\u2019\n\nThe women being attacked at the Independence Day march in 2017. Tomasz Stepien\n\nOne by one the women stood up, said their full names and stated proudly that they wanted to be found \u2018not guilty.\u2019 Kinga, the last of them to speak, explained bluntly and movingly what compelled her to stand against hate on that night: \u2018My grandfather was wounded in the battle of \u201939. My mother went to the Uprising. My stepfather was in the home army in Kielce. My grandmother worked in a hospital. They are now dead and I am happy because I would not like them to see what is happening today.\u2019\n\nAs the judgement was announced, I couldn\u2019t follow but I kept my fingers crossed (as if that would make any difference but I was not sure what else to do in that moment). And suddenly I heard relieved sighs around the room. I turn to my colleague asking \u201cwhat did he say?\u201d and she confirmed: \u201cThey are not guilty! They are not guilty!\u201d\n\nThe judge upheld their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and, significantly, he told the women, \u201cYou were right.\u201d As he finished, the room burst into a round of applause in celebration.\n\nMy emotions were bubbling up! I, like many others, have always been inspired by the determination of these women who never gave up. It took two years of fighting charges they should never have faced for a judge to finally understand the importance of standing for what\u2019s right. On this day, justice was delivered not only for 14 women, but for all the protesters who have, in recent years, faced similar charges and punishments for standing up for their rights.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of letters, signatures and appeals sent to the Polish authorities by Amnesty activists from around the world also helped, as well as the hundreds of solidarity messages giving the women strength to continue fighting!\n\nThis case started with injustice but has finished with justice, and a message that fascism and hatred will not be tolerated in Poland.\n\nCatrinel Motoc is Amnesty International's senior campaigner on shrinking space and on human rights defenders at risk\n\n____________\n\nAre you a recognised expert in your field?
