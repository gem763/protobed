(AP) - Tucson is raising the minimum age to buy e-cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21 years old, up from 18, effective Jan. 1.\n\nThe Arizona Daily Star reports that the City Council\u2019s 6-1 vote Tuesday night makes the southern Arizona city the fifth in the state to adopt such an ordinance.\n\nThe Pima County Board of Supervisors rejected a similar proposal recently, and the Tucson ordinance applies only within city limits.\n\nIt will include a 90-day educational period before enforcement begins. The enforcement will be handled by the city\u2019s business services and code enforcement departments.\n\nFirst-time violations by businesses selling tobacco products to people younger than 21 will be punishable by a $500 fine. Penalties escalate with subsequent violations.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tucson is raising the minimum age to buy e-cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21 years old, up from 18, effective Jan. 1.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
