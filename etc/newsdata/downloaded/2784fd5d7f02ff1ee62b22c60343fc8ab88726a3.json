However, the study covers tax years 2011 through 2013, and the IRS has reduced audits and staffing considerably since then.\n\nIn those years, taxpayers paid 83.6% of the taxes they owed voluntarily and a total of 85.8% after IRS enforcement efforts. Those are about equal to the previous study, which covered tax years 2008 through 2010 and was updated with the same methodology used for the new analysis.\n\n\"Voluntary compliance is the bedrock of our tax system, and it's important it is holding steady,\" Charles Rettig, the IRS commissioner, said in a statement.\n\nAchieving 100% compliance isn't realistic, and getting there would require a much more intrusive government. Tax compliance scholars point to a variety of factors that drive taxpayer behavior. Among the largest are third-party information reporting and withholding.\n\nWage earners know that the IRS has a Form W-2 showing how much money they made and a year's worth of withheld taxes. There's little incentive to cheat when it can be caught so easily. For income with substantial information reporting and withholding, the IRS says just 1% of income is underreported.\n\nAt the other extreme, owners of cash businesses know that the IRS has little if any independent information about their revenue and expenses. For that and other income without information reporting, 55% is misreported, according to the IRS.\n\nEnforcement matters, too. Audits collect money directly and deter taxpayers from cheating.\n\nBut today's IRS employs fewer people and audits fewer taxpayers than it used to. That's the result of Congress giving the tax agency more responsibilities while cutting its budget or leaving it flat.\n\nIn fiscal 2018, the tax agency had 73,519 employees, down 22% from 2011. That same year, the IRS audited just 0.59% of individual tax returns, marking the seventh straight decline in that figure and the lowest rate since 2002.\n\nWrite to Richard Rubin at richard.rubin@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 14:14 ET (18:14 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
