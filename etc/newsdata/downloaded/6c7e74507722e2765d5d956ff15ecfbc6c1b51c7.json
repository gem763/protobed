I had one job where they said it\u2019s \u00a313 per hour but I came out with \u00a37/\u00a38 per hour because of admin and agency fees.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sick pay, no benefits and you don\u2019t have a contract, so there are no guarantees.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had jobs that have lasted a day, jobs that have lasted a week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to retrain but getting the money together is impossible.\u201d\n\nThe mum-of-two is one of an estimated 700,000 people working as cleaners in the UK, many of them via an agency or outsourcing company, including many migrant workers.\n\nNext month (November 1) a new film from director Ken Loach highlights the problems faced by gig economy workers like Tracey.\n\nCreated by the team behind, I, Daniel Blake, it shows a family buckling under the pressure of long shifts and \u2018self-employment\u2019.\n\n\n\nCleaner Andrea Ruskin, 32, has experienced all this. She lives in Mansfield, Notts, with her two children and recently set up her own company to leave the gig economy behind.\n\n\n\n\u201cNow I am actually self-employed,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the past I was told I was but I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I was just working without benefits.\n\n\u201cWe had to invoice rather than get a payslip, but they still told us where to be and when.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cYou had to use your own transport and didn\u2019t get paid for travel time. There was no sick pay \u2013 if you were ill you took it as holiday.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of those campaigning for better terms for gig economy workers, including cleaners, is the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain (IWGB).\n\n\n\nAs caseworker Jordi Lopez-Botey explains: \u201cThe system itself needs to be challenged. Outsourcing means workers struggle to know who is accountable, who they need to speak to when things go wrong.\n\n\n\n\u201cRights can be eroded very quickly.\u201d\n\nNew film exposes grim work reality\n\nFrom the team that brought you I, Daniel Blake comes Sorry We Missed You, a powerful exploration of the contemporary world of work.\n\nIn the fim, released in cinemas November 1, overworked contract nurse Abbie (Debbie Honeywood) cares for disabled and elderly people, often at the expense of tucking in her own children at night.\n\nThis raw tale shines a light on the injustice suffered by thousands of workers facing similar conditions, in the hope of change.", "description": "The mum-of-two reveals how the gig economy has got hard working people trapped in poverty, ahead of the release of the new Ken Loach film, 'Sorry We Missed You'", "authors": ["Claire Donnelly", "Image", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article20716238.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195879805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
