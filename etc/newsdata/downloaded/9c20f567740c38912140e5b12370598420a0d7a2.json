I believe that the former vice president is a decent, honorable man who possesses the right values for America and cares deeply about all people. I am certain he would restore rationality and decency to the American presidency. But I would write this column regardless of who I was supporting in the 2020 presidential election, because I believe it must be said.\n\nThough I don\u2019t have an estimated number, and I\u2019m not sure if anyone really tracks this, there are thousands of us in America who closely follow politics on a daily basis. That includes members of the national media, and some in local media organizations, and those of us who make our living from politics. To us, gaffes by candidates are huge news; sometimes they wind up featured on the front page of newspapers. But often, average Americans don\u2019t think that what we insiders consider a gaffe truly is a gaffe \u2014 or they really don\u2019t care whether candidates are prone to gaffes.\n\nAn example of the former was when the media made a big deal about Biden saying, \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,\u201d which he immediately corrected by saying, \u201cWealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids.\u201d If you played an excerpt of his comments to an average voting-age American, he or she likely would say, \u201cOkay, tell me what was wrong with that?\u201d Yet, we political elites made a big deal about it.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe best examples of Americans not caring about gaffes can be found in the electoral success of Ronald Reagan, who was prone to telling stories that were confusing and often inaccurate, and George W. Bush, on whom we could count for at least a gaffe a week. As I recall, President Reagan carried 49 states in his landslide election, despite his many gaffes, and \u201cW\u201d twice was elected president.\n\nWhen it comes to Biden \u2014 to use the hot phrase of the month \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cbaked in\u201d with the American people that he makes gaffes. They see it as a reflection of his passion, emotion and the fact that he doesn\u2019t utilize prepared remarks when speaking publicly. It actually makes him appear genuine, authentic. And his gaffes are not outright lies; they\u2019re likely the result of a faulty memory or some confusion about the facts.\n\nIf Biden becomes the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee, let\u2019s remember he would be running against a \u201cLiar-in-Chief\u201d who probably makes misstatements two or three times a week, at least. And just for contrast, compare Biden\u2019s gaffe about the \u201cpoor kids\u201d to President Trump Donald John Trump Poll: 40 percent of voters don't think Trump will win reelection Mattis: 'I'll speak out' about policy issues 'when the time comes' China contests Trump claim it is fentanyl source MORE\u2019s performance on the Fourth of July, when he said: \u201cOur army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over the airports, it did everything it had to do, and at Fort McHenry, under the rockets\u2019 red glare, it had nothing but victory.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s gaffe about taking \u201cthe airports\u201d during the Revolutionary War was astounding. Though he blamed a broken teleprompter, we asked, is he the stupidest man ever to become President of the United State? But the president did not suffer any lasting consequences from his ridiculous statement. His approval rating didn\u2019t deviate because gaffes simply don\u2019t matter to the average voter.\n\nAnd all of us smart, smug media members and politicos should face up to the fact that we are gaffe-prone, too.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome people made a big deal when Trump said he was sorry about the \u201cshooting in Toledo,\u201d describing the tragedy in Dayton, and when Biden mentioned the \u201cshooting in Houston\u201d when he meant El Paso. But just before I began writing this column, I was watching MSNBC correspondent Garrett Haake, an astute political reporter, talk about Biden\u2019s war story that the Washington Post said contains misstated facts. Haake signed off by saying, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the mood of the people here in Iowa\u201d \u2014 but he was actually in South Carolina.\n\nHe later Tweeted: \u201cI said I was in Iowa. I am in South Carolina. I have been for days. I will do this 100 more times before November 2020.\u201d Were he the presidential candidate, you can bet his slip of the tongue would have made the front page.\n\nEdward G.
