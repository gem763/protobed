The three legendary rock bands are joining forces across the globe on the Hella Mega Tour. Not just mega, hella mega and that\u2019s because on top of performing classics as crowd members recall their lost youth, all three bands are taking brand-new albums on tour. And the fun starts today. Each band released brand-new singles to kick off the chaos. Green Day\u2019s track, \u201cFather of All \u2026 \u201d (ellipses included) is the lead single from their forthcoming album of the same name. The song comes with a little poem from Billie Joe Armstrong himself. \u201cMe mike and Tre of the Green Day cut through the bullshit,\u201d reads the YouTube description. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been for us.\u201d Father of All \u2026 arrives February 7, 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Fall Out Boy served up their song \u201cDear Future Self\u201d (featuring Wyclef Jean) on a cone, with an ice cream\u2013focused music video. Their album Greatest Hits: Believers Never Die - Volume Two is the first of the three albums to arrive, dropping on November 15. Last but definitely not least, Weezer released a full music video for their single \u201cThe End of the Game\u201d from Van Weezer. The album won\u2019t be out until May 15, but Weezer \u201cmight release it sooner\u201d just \u2018cause. Rules don\u2019t apply when you\u2019re actively going down in history. Tickets to the Hella Mega Tour go on sale September 20 via Ticketmaster and performances kick off June 13, 2020 in Paris.
