Elizabeth Warren played up her early years in Texas during a stump speech in the state capital Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThis is really family for me,\u201d said the former professor of the University of Texas at Austin and University of Houston.\n\nA day earlier, Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former U.S. Housing and Urban Development secretary, asked his audience to imagine Houston\u2014\u201ca place that represents the future\u201d\u2014as the launchpad of his underdog campaign for president.\n\nTen Democratic presidential candidates, along with the party\u2019s top brass, are homing in on Texas this week ahead of Thursday\u2019s third Democratic primary debate in Houston. The competing rallies from Ms. Warren and Mr. Castro served notice of Texas\u2019 growing importance on the primary calendar and of the party\u2019s long-term hopes to turn the electoral giant into a competitive general election battleground.\n\nThe leading Democratic candidates look likely to share the same stage at the next presidential debate, after Tom Steyer failed to get the support needed to qualify, according to two polls.

Beto O\u2019Rourke, who was narrowly defeated by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, give them an advantage at this stage competing for the state\u2019s delegates on Super Tuesday. The O\u2019Rourke campaign, which has lost momentum since his splashy entrance to the race, pointed to strength in Texas by highlighting a new Univision/University of Houston poll showing him in a dead heat with former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nMost early polls in the state have shown Messrs. Biden and O\u2019Rourke leading here, followed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Ms. Warren. Mr. Castro has been polling in single digits in the state.\n\nTexas\u2019 diverse electorate and size make it, along with California, one of the biggest opportunities for Democrats in the primary campaign.\n\nIt awards its delegates proportionally based on statewide results in the primary and in each state Senate district. Candidates need to cross a threshold of 15% to receive delegates. That gives the large field of Democrats an incentive to compete for delegates in the state\u2019s largest urban areas, including Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston and the area encompassing Austin and San Antonio.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s room for half a dozen candidates to compete in Texas and get delegates,\u201d said Matt Angle, the founder and director of the Lone Star Project, an organization that has helped Democratic campaigns in the state. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t think you can run first in Texas, it may make sense to compete so you can get your share of delegates.\u201d\n\nTexas\u2019 228 delegates represent about 17% of the overall share up for grabs on Super Tuesday, which is March 3. California\u2019s 416 delegates represent nearly one-third of the date\u2019s delegate share. The two states are the top prizes up for grabs that day. The 10 candidates appearing on the Houston debate stage have made 58 trips to California in the past two years. The same candidates have made 22 trips to Texas.\n\nRepublicans are banking on President Trump in 2020 to bring out traditional GOP voters in Texas.

O\u2019Rourke and Castro in Texas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just such a big state and even though there are two people running (from Texas), I think there\u2019s room and clearly my brand of politics can fit in there,\u201d said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.\n\nMr. O\u2019Rourke has used the strength of his 2018 Senate campaign to help provide a foundation for his presidential bid. He has attracted roughly 78,000 donors from Texas, far more than any other candidate, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of Federal Election Commission data.\n\nDemocrats are using the debate as a backdrop for their pitch to suburban voters, a key bloc in the 2020 election. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez planned to hold a roundtable event Thursday in the suburbs of Harris County to point to the party\u2019s differences with President Trump on issues including the economy, gun control and health care.\n\n\u201cTexas has become a major defensive liability for Republicans,\u201d said David Bergstein, the DNC spokesman focused on the party\u2019s battleground states. He cited Mr. Trump\u2019s drop in polling in Texas and the slate of House Republicans who have decided not to run for re-election as positive signs for the Democratic Party in 2020. Of the 16 House Republican retirements this year, five of them are from Texas.\n\nA Univision poll before the debate showed Mr. Trump\u2019s job approval rating at 44% to 56% who disapproved.\n\nMs. Warren is using Texas to highlight her differences with the Democratic Party\u2019s moderate flank. Earlier this week, she endorsed Jessica Cisneros, the liberal challenger to Rep. Henry Cuellar, an eight-term Democrat in Congress who has been criticized by his party\u2019s left flank for opposing abortion rights and receiving support from the National Rifle Association. Ms. Cisneros introduced the presidential hopeful in Austin.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are looking to fortify a longtime stronghold. The party feels it has an advantage in Texas in large part because the statewide apparatus has been successful for so long. While acknowledging geographical shifts, Republicans are banking on Mr. Trump in 2020 to bring out traditional GOP voters who sat out during the midterm election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just basic common knowledge that the electorate shifts in the presidential election year,\u201d said Republican National Committee spokesman Rick Gorka. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to lose there because it\u2019s a red state. It\u2019s not even an option.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats here are cautiously optimistic. Asked why she thought Texas might soon turn blue in a presidential race, Gwyn Waterfield, a 49-year-old window-washer of San Marcus, Texas, who attended the Warren rally, responded: \u201cWishful thinking.\u201d\n\n\u2014Eliza Collins, Chad Day, Emily Glazer and Julie Bykowicz contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com and Ken Thomas at ken.thomas@wsj.com", "description": "Texas is playing a bigger role in the Democratic primary calendar, as the party looks to break Republicans\u2019 hold on the Lone Star State and turn it into a 2020 battleground.", "authors": ["Joshua Jamerson", "Ken Thomas", "Joshua.Jamerson Wsj.Com", "Ken.Thomas Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106006/social", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
