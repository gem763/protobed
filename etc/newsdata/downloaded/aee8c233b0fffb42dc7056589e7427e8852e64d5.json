Because he will not shut the old hamburger hole.\u201d\n\nLast week, Colbert\u2014and his fellow late-night hosts\u2014expressed disbelief that the Trump administration would release such a self-incriminating summary of the president\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. Now, he can\u2019t believe that Trump is just admitting to his alleged crimes out loud.\n\n\u201cEverything he has said for the last 48 hours just makes him guiltier,\u201d the host added, before playing the clip of Trump calling on not just Ukraine, but also China to start investigating Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cThat is literally what they\u2019re impeaching you for. Don\u2019t say that out loud. That\u2019s like if Jeffrey Dahmer showed up in court wearing an apron that said \u2018Kiss the Cook.\u2019\u201d\n\nColbert then attempted to make sense of \u201cwhat\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump knows if something\u2019s bad, you don\u2019t admit it in public,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if he admits it in public it must not be bad. He\u2019s trying to normalize it.\u201d\n\nThe host compared what Trump is doing to a husband saying, \u201cHoney, I know you think it\u2019s wrong for me to have sex with our neighbor, but if it were, why would I be doing it in the middle of your book club?\u201d", "description": "The \u201cLate Show\u201d host has a theory about why Trump is now committing his impeachable offenses \u201cout loud.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570151735/SC_44_aw9w8b", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
