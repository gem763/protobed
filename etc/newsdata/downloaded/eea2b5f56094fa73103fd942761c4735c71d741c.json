(Image: Warner Bros.)\n\nWhile you wait for more Birds of Prey movie news, or even Birds of Prey(ish) TV news, here\u2019s the Birds of Prey news you didn\u2019t even know you wanted. Thanks to the CW\u2019s Crisis crossover event, the Huntress of the early aughts is back in action.\n\nYes, the CW has confirmed that Ashley Scott (and her iconic bob) will return, in the latest of the seemingly endless and increasingly bananas announcements about just which Warner Bros/DC TV icons are returning for Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nScott, of course, played Helena Kyle \u2014 AKA DC vigilante heroine The Huntress \u2014 in WB\u2019s short-lived Birds of Prey TV series back in 2002, alongside Dina Meyer as Barbara Gordon\u2019s Batgirl/Oracle and Rachel Skarsten (who has now come full circle playing Alice, the villain of the upcoming Batwoman CW show) as Dinah Lance, the Black Canary.\n\nNo word on if Scott will be joined by Meyer or Skarsten in their Birds of Prey roles yet, but honestly? At this point, I wouldn\u2019t put it past the CW to have a Skarsten v Skarsten: Dawn of Skarsten fight scene in this crossover\n\nIt sounds increasingly wild with every bit of news we\u2019re getting, or at least as though some CW executive is just flicking through a Rolodex of actors who played DC superheroes on Warner Bros TV before Arrow made it cool \u2014 and then just chucking Kevin Conroy in for good measure \u2014 with a frankly reckless abandon.\n\nBut, I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: While the CW is handing out appearances as though they\u2019re goddamn lollies, they need to fast track a confirmation on that rumour for Lynda Carter coming back as Wonder Woman.\n\nIf we get all this bonkers guest star madness and not some fighting for our rights in satin tights, then frankly, why even bother with this crossover in the first place?\n\nThe five-part Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover special begins this December.", "description": "While you wait for more Birds of Prey movie news, or even Birds of Prey(ish) TV news, here\u2019s the Birds of Prey news you didn\u2019t even know you wanted.
