By such offers, they stopped us from suing the departments for illegally using the software. The board and management have also been changing while the matter was on and we have been dealing with new people all the time,\u201d Richardson said.\n\n\u201cCertain individuals have tried speaking to me and promised me a lot of things. I was treated very badly because I refused to cut deals with certain individuals. I have evidence to prove this,\u201d she said.\n\nRobertson said Sita board chairman Zukile Nomvete was the only individual who had been at the agency long enough to know the details of the dispute since she took Sita to court in 2009.\n\nSita received a R17 million grant from the Development Bank of Southern Africa for the project. It is unclear what happened to the money.\n\nSita spokesperson Anthea Summers did not respond to questions emailed to her about two weeks ago, despite promising to do so.\n\nA number of documents and emails City Press has seen indicate that Sita officials accepted the debt and had been willing to settle since 2014. For some reason, they ended up not doing so.\n\nOne example is a letter former chief executive officer Freeman Nomvalo, wrote to Robertson on March 20 2014, to present a counter-offer.\n\n\u201cFor the purposes of pure settlement, and in order to avoid costly litigation and the costs involved thereof, Sita hereby presents the following counter-offer for your consideration: Payment of the capital amount of R3 694 513.50 in full and final settlement and each party to pay its own legal costs,\u201d Nomvalo wrote.\n\nAnother email that former Sita board chairperson, Mavuso Msimang wrote to Joe Mazibuko, one of his executives, indicates that officials lied when they said that Harebueng had been paid. Msimang was responding to Richardson\u2019s complaint about not being paid.\n\n\u201cI should be grateful if you would, as a matter of urgency, attend to this matter and advise me of the outcome by close of business today,\u201d Msimang wrote.\n\n\u201cI would like you to know that I personally spoke to Mckay (position not mentioned) last week and he was categorical in his statement that the payment had been made.\u201d\n\nOther bungles\n\nSita has gone to the high court to review and terminate a contract awarded to forensic investigators iFirm on May 21 2014.\n\nThe company was appointed to investigate the theft of computers, but after doing that job, Nomvalo extended their scope to probe alleged irregularities pertaining to a R1 billion cloud computing tender awarded to US multinational IBM South Africa in 2013.\n\nCloud computing is advanced IT technology that was intended to improve government\u2019s data centre and infrastructure.\n\nIBM\u2019s bid for the cloud computing tender was disqualified in November 2012, but officials embedded the tender in the three-year integrated supply agreement (ISA) that IBM signed with Sita in 2013.\n\nThis means that IBM did not have to bid for the tender as received it through the back door.\n\nCity Press has documents indicating that Sita officials tried to reverse former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s 2014 Special Investigating Unit proclamation that authorised an investigation of the ISA.\n\nLast year, Sita lost its bid to get the Constitutional Court to review and reverse a multimillion-rand contract it awarded businessman Robert Gumede\u2019s Gijima Holdings on September 27 2006.\n\nSita terminated the information technology services contract for the SA Police Service in 2012 and, as an out-of-court settlement for Gijima to abandon a R20 million damages claim, Sita offered Gijima another contract to service the defence department.\n\nHowever, Sita awarded the defence contract without following tender procedures and assured Gijima that everything was above board.\n\nAlthough the Constitutional Court found that the defence department\u2019s agreement was constitutionally invalid, it found that Gijima ought not to be divested of its accrued rights under the agreement.\n\nThe court ordered that Gijima be paid R9 million owed and its legal costs.", "description": "The State Information Technology Agency\u2019s persistent bungling of contracts has pitted it against a company that is owed R3.7 million since 2003.", "authors": ["Sizwe Sama Yende"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4593/05073ea3a96449e3982af27f0c2dd93f.jpg", "published_at": "2018-03-19"}
