This has been taken to mean Russian troops, although Russia denies that its soldiers are present in the east.\n\nA gamble for Ukraine's president\n\nBy Jonah Fisher, BBC Kiev correspondent\n\nPresident Zelensky made bringing peace to eastern Ukraine his number one election promise. And he's certainly trying.\n\nLast month there was a significant prisoner swap with Russia and now the former comedian has publicly agreed to the Steinmeier formula. That should pave the way for talks with Russia, Germany and France in what's known as the Normandy Format.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Freed Ukrainians met their families in September after months of separation\n\nThe most sensitive aspect of the Steinmeier formula is that it allows local elections to take place in the occupied parts of Ukraine before Russian-backed forces have withdrawn, and Kiev has control of the border.\n\nThough elections in Donetsk and Luhansk would be monitored by observers from the OSCE and would in theory be under Ukrainian law, it's hard to see how they would be fairly contested.\n\nMost people with strongly pro-Ukrainian views have long ago left the occupied areas for their own safety. So it seems almost inevitable that the elections would consolidate the position of the Russia-aligned leaders who are currently in place, granting them the recognition Moscow has long craved.\n\nWith Ukraine having allowed the election to go ahead, and then granting the region's special status, it would then be up to Russia to honour its part of the deal, withdraw its weapons and hand over control of the Ukrainian side of the common border.\n\nIt's not hard to see why President Zelensky's critics see this as a major concession, if not a capitulation.\n\nWhat reaction has there been?\n\nRussia has backed the Ukrainian move and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he expected a summit to take place soon.\n\nMr Zelensky's predecessor as president, Petro Poroshenko, was damning of the deal, referring to it as \"Putin's formula\", while ex-Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin was dubious about the chances of free and fair elections.\n\n\"Society will be demanding answers, and these answers should not be solving the issue of Donbass occupation at Ukraine's expense,\" he said.\n\nOne former Ukrainian negotiator warned it was a \"path to war, not to peace\", while rock singer Svyatoslav Vakarchuk, who leads the Voice party in Ukraine, called on the president to explain the concessions he was ready to make.", "description": "Hundreds of Ukrainians protest as the president backs a plan for elections in separatist-held areas.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0C03/production/_109057030_a007fe10-10f8-4680-a02e-bb90d1255321.jpg"}
