In one example, Rey Mysterio's mask dissolved into his face.\n\nAnother mistake shared on social media showed WWE Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch with disembodied facial features.\n\nAnother visual error, which might be more at home in a horror film, shows a wrestler suffering from an extremely lazy eye.\n\nFans have also directed criticism at gameplay bugs, which they say are so severe that they leave players with no choice but to quit the game.\n\nVideos of the problems show characters being crushed and sinking inside the wrestling ring.\n\nOne video of Charlotte Flair being flung in circles around Sasha Banks has been viewed more than 700,000 times on Twitter.\n\nAnother post shows wrestlers Alexa Bliss, Carmella and Kairi Sane bouncing violently against the ropes and canvas, as the referee is literally absorbed into the ring.\n\n2K Sports, which makes the game, has not yet replied to a BBC request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, some fans who purchased a special edition of the game have voiced their frustration at it not including a promised autograph from a WWE legend.\n\nThe WWE 2K20 Collector's Edition is priced at \u00a3139.99 and according to retailer Game \"includes a collectible acrylic piece containing one of three possible WWE SmackDown Legend Autographs\".\n\nBut some fans said their \"collectible acrylic piece\" was missing a signature.\n\n2K Games has advised fans to get in touch to resolve the problem. But WWE legend Edge has taken things further.\n\nThe former wrestler tweeted a guarantee that he will send a private message on Twitter to anyone missing his autograph, and arrange to send them a replacement.", "description": "Wrestling fans have slammed the new WWE 2K20 video game over visual glitches and game-breaking bugs.", "authors": ["Tom Gerken", "Bbc Ugc", "Social News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/14DA6/production/_109341458_90650d42-2256-4a93-aa84-823472f68a35.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
