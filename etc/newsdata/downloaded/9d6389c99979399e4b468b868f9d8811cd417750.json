Break ups and divorce aren\u2019t the end; they\u2019re the beginning of a new chapter in your life. But how do you handle the aftermath of an ugly break up? What about when you just can\u2019t let go of an ex? What about when your ex just won\u2019t let you go?\n\nIt\u2019s time to collect your new equipment and skills and go open doors in those areas you could never get through. Let\u2019s do this.\n\nHey Doc, So first, a little backstory: About two months ago, I asked out and briefly dated a friend of mine. We met initially at her workplace, my regular cafe, about a year ago while I was still in a relationship. I didn\u2019t have any romantic feelings for her, but we had great banter and shared everything in common. Like everything. It was very weird but exhilarating for us. Fast forward past a breakup and several months of emotional recovery, and it occurred to me one day while we were talking about Japanese-Heideggerian Zen philosophy at the cafe counter I\u2019d caught feelings for my friend/barista. And her constant, pointed interest in spending inordinate amounts of time while she was on the clock seemed like some pretty clear signals. I asked her out pretty soon after that, and things seemed to start off great. Good conversations, good chemistry, etc. We even had the \u201cwhat are you looking for?\u201d conversation, and we both stated we were looking for a serious partner. Really, it was looking good. But about a month in she started to cancel plans on me, mainly due to travel, and then our dates went from hikes and drinks to \u201cdates plus this one friend of hers.\u201d Then she revealed that she\u2019d been seeing other people, which is fine; we weren\u2019t exclusive nor had we talked about being exclusive. Except, she\u2019d asked me earlier point blank whether I was seeing other people (I wasn\u2019t), and I\u2019d returned the question (she wasn\u2019t). And apparently we both liked it that way. We were, and I quote, \u201cOld fashioned like that.\u201d Suddenly, though, the narrative was that she\u2019d never said that. And then, even more suddenly, it was that she HAD said that, but had changed her mind when her friends encouraged her to try dating around. The coup de grace was when I texted her on her birthday and... radio silence. Fine, I thought, I get the message. Not long after that, I told her that I wasn\u2019t interested in seeing her anymore, since I generally don\u2019t like to date someone who blows me off, lies to me and gaslights me (I didn\u2019t tell her that second part, though). This surprised and hurt her, which surprised and hurt me, but that\u2019s life I guess. OK, backstory over. Since then, we\u2019ve obviously still run into each other a lot. I need my coffee, after all, and she\u2019s the one who makes it. But this is where it gets confusing. Every couple weeks, almost like clockwork, she sends me a text. \u201cSorry I made you feel bad\u201d was the first. \u201cHave you seen Midsommar!?\u201d was the next. \u201cHow should I act around you?\u201d unexpectedly arrived one morning. \u201cThanks for talking to me\u201d (after a brief, cordial conversation we\u2019d had earlier that day) was last week. I always responded to these in a brief, neutral tone: \u201cOK, thanks.\u201d \u201cThat director\u2019s not really my speed.\u201d \u201cCordial is always welcome.\u201d \u201cOf course, no problem.\u201d And finally, two nights ago, she liked me on Tinder. Huh? What is going on here? I am incredibly confused. A part of me wants her to leave me alone after all the not so pleasant shenanigans she pulled, but another part of me maybe wants to try pursuing this again since nothing about her that made me like her in the first place has changed. But first and foremost, I want to know what her motives are with these bimonthly texts. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been inviting her conversation; the most I say to her in person, with one exception, is a cordial good morning, thank you and goodbye when I grab my morning coffee. I could think the worst of her and assume she just wants to be the object of someone\u2019s affection, to be chased by me again. Or she\u2019s still interested, either in friendship or more, and this is her awkwardly trying to bridge the gap between us. The latter might be wishful thinking... tl;dr: Guy meets gal. Gal and guy like each other. Gal blows off and gaslights guy. Guy gets out. Gal keeps texting guy (and then likes him on a dating app). Guy gets confused. Guy is still confused. What gives? I would love your feedback, since all of your advice columns have really resonated with me. I think I know the answer to this situation, but here I am! Sincerely, Once Bitten Twice Shy\n\nYour ex\u2019s behaviour is weird, OBTS. The general progression of your relationship sounds less like the behaviour of someone you were dating and more \u201ctrying to get this guy to realise that I\u2019m not into him.\u201d Suddenly changing one-on-one hangouts to \u201chey, it\u2019s gonna be a group thing?\u201d That\u2019s usually something that happens with somebody who\u2019s trying to give somebody the wave-off without having to have a potentially fraught \u201cNo really, I don\u2019t like you like that\u201d conversation.\n\nWhich makes little sense if you two were having preliminary \u201cwhere is this relationship going?\u201d conversations; those tend to happen when you\u2019re not quite ready for an exclusive commitment, but you could definitely see the relationship heading that way.\n\nThere are two likely possibilities here. The first is that there\u2019s something that you missed or that there\u2019s some detail that would explain where her head\u2019s at.\n\nThe other is that it\u2019s entirely possible that your ex doesn\u2019t know what she wants. Her behaviour\u2014both while you were dating and afterwards \u2014 makes her sound like someone who may well have meant what she said when she said it, but will change her mind at the drop of a hat. At that point her new decision gets retconned into how it\u2019s always been because hey, what else could it have been\n\n(Also, suddenly deciding \u201cGuess I should go date other people after all\u201d just because her friends suggested it? This is supposed to make it more reasonable?)\n\nSo while she may have been OK with slow-walking you out of the relationship, she may have decided that no, she actually liked having you around in her life. And thus, these regularly scheduled texts.\n\nIt does seem like she\u2019s someone who is conflict- and confrontation-averse; the bi-weekly texts sound a lot like someone who\u2019s pinging a connection to see if it\u2019s still active. The fact that it\u2019s bi-weekly sounds like she\u2019s doing the thing where she tries to stay in contact without either overwhelming you or seeming too needy.\n\n(Women reading this may recognise it as something that guys have pulled on them.)\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, this may be her way of trying to reopen lines of communication with you. Alternately, this could be her trying to gauge whether or not you\u2019re still upset with her; after all, as long as you\u2019re responding, you can\u2019t be that mad, can you?\n\nI suspect that the fact that you keep going back for coffee confuses things. The fact that you two split doesn\u2019t mean that you have to avoid her at all costs, but if you\u2019re going to keep showing up where you know she\u2019s gonna be, it certainly can make it seem like you\u2019re still interested in the possibility of picking things up again. I mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a great barista and all, but I seriously doubt this is the only place where you can get your coffee in the morning.\n\nBut at the end of the day, if you want to know what she\u2019s thinking, then I\u2019m not the person to ask. She is. If you want to get an idea of what\u2019s going on, then you\u2019re gonna have to use your words and get it from her.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not a conversation to have at work, yours or hers. So the next time she texts, use that as an opportunity to ask. \u201cHey, when you started ghosting me and not returning my texts, I took it as a sign you weren\u2019t interested. But now you\u2019re messaging me and matching with me on Tinder, so I\u2019m getting confused. What\u2019s going on here?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s going to be up to you to decide what to do with whatever answer she gives you.\n\nHowever, I strongly suggest that you keep any future relationship to friendship, if that. Frankly, while you may still dig her, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth your time to pursue a romantic relationship with her again. It doesn\u2019t sound to me like she\u2019s changed significantly in the time since you two dated, so trying to get back together will just be a rerun of your first go-round. The only difference will be that you\u2019ll see the train wreck coming this time, and you still won\u2019t be able to avoid it.\n\n(As a general rule of thumb: if there hasn\u2019t been a discussion about how the relationship ended and why, with everyone acknowledging their part in it, then going back for more is just an exercise in futility.)\n\nMeanwhile, consider finding a new place to get coffee, or brewing it at home before you leave for work.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHey Doc, Long time reader, and I really appreciate all your advice. It has always given me a different perspective in my own love life, and has helped me grow as a person in this aspect of my life. This is the first time I am really reaching out to anyone about something that I just can\u2019t shake. So, a little backstory, I am mid 30s, and going through a tough time. Divorce is completely looming, separation has happened and lawyers are all being called at this point. I am heartbroken, but not just because my marriage is ending, but because I have to put my son through what I went through when I was a kid. I never wanted to see my parents fight, and I did the exact same thing. I am struggling to cope with being alone, since I have never really had any time where I was alone. I know I have a lot to work on, including most likely being codependent. When you leave a 20 year relationship, it is tough. I know I will get through it, but it is exposing all of my flaws and bad habits I have created and have to break. I recently met someone else. She lives in another state, and this has only been long distance. I am able to go see her, as I travel to her city for work often, and, well, planes are available whenever I really want to go somewhere. The thing is, we bonded very quickly over a lot of things. We generally enjoy the same things, we are on the same page on just about everything. We talked and texted nonstop for the first couple of weeks, which has tapered off a bit now that we have settled into a pattern, and it has been amazing to have a positive light in my world of utter depression right now. She seems interested in me romantically, and I have communicated that I am interested in her as well. We also discussed our emotional availability. I know I can\u2019t be emotionally available, and she has said the same. We can only be friends right now. It is an amazing friendship, and I want to preserve it because she is such an amazing person, I would lose a very positive person in my life without her in it. I have kept up my end of the bargain, and I have just kept friends, but I am struggling, and this is where I would like your advice. How do I get her out of my mind? How do I keep from pushing for a relationship? How do I just stay friends with her? I know that if I push this, especially now, when I am broken and in this state, that everything will end badly. I have to work on me, and I don\u2019t want to impose anything on her that will make her choose. I really want to just be friends right now, get to really know her and have that foundation, and when I feel like I can stand on my own two feet, I will revisit my feelings for her. I know this is a little different from the other advice questions you get, but I really could use some help figuring out how to control my own emotions now that the whole glass house has exploded. Sincerely, Just Friends\n\nSo if you\u2019ve been reading my column for a while, then you\u2019ll have seen the times when I\u2019ve talked about avoiding The Friend Zone*.\n\n*There is no Friend Zone. There are just people who don\u2019t want to date or have sex with you.\n\nThe key to avoiding ending up in The Friend Zone is that you make your intentions known and you act like a potential lover, not a friend. When someone attempts to pull the Platonic Friend Backdoor Gambit, their behaviour sets the expectation that they just want to be friends, not that they\u2019re hoping to get a relationship upgrade during a moment of weakness on the other person\u2019s part.\n\nThe key to staying friends with someone you\u2019re attracted to means doing the opposite; you want to treat her as a friend, not somebody that you\u2019re attracted to. That means setting some boundaries for yourself; it\u2019s not fair for the two of you to talk about how much you want to date when you know that you can\u2019t right now. Giving indications about how you would totally date or bang someone but whooooops, can\u2019t because REASONS is cruel to do to somebody that you know is into you.\n\nIt just leaves them on the hook when it would be better for them to be free to pursue relationships that DO have a chance. That\u2019s why you have to cut out the flirting and romance talk; it just sets a frame to the relationship that only leaves people upset and frustrated.\n\nBut that no-romance talk applies to you too. The more you go on about how much you wish you could be with her \u2014 even just to yourself \u2014 the more you reinforce your feelings for her. Instead, you need to just let the feelings pass over you, around you and past you without engaging with them. You can note them and name them \u2014 \u201cYup, there\u2019s my inconvenient crush on my friend\u201d \u2014 and just let them go. Without reinforcement, they\u2019ll start to fade on their own over time.\n\nYou may also have to dial back the intimacy and intensity of your conversations with her, or at least spread them out amongst other friends. Part of why straight cis men so often develop feelings for their female friends is because of how rarely we have emotionally intimate friendships with others, particularly other men.\n\nWe\u2019re taught that emotional intimacy is a precursor to sexual intimacy, and so we convert those intense, emotionally fulfilling relationships to romance because we\u2019re only allowed to have those relationships with people we might sleep with. So it becomes incredibly easy to decide we\u2019ve caught feels instead of recognising what a close friendship feels like.\n\nBut you can\u2019t be friends with her in hopes that this just puts the two of you on pause until you\u2019re ready to date. If you aren\u2019t in a position to date right now \u2014 and you would know best \u2014 then being her friend isn\u2019t how you keep her around until you have your life together again. You\u2019re going to have to be cool with the fact that she won\u2019t be waiting around for you. She will likely start dating other people.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, then you can\u2019t get passive-aggressive about it or make comments about the guys she\u2019s dating. You\u2019ll have to learn to be happy for and appreciate her happiness, even as you\u2019re working on discovering your own.\n\nNone of this means that there\u2019s no chance for you further down the road. But you can\u2019t go into this thinking that friendship is the holding pattern until you\u2019re ready to date again. If she\u2019s right for you now, she\u2019ll still be right for you in the months or even years down the line when you\u2019ve worked through everything and you\u2019re ready to get back in the game.\n\nBut that\u2019s for the future. For now: just focus on yourself. You\u2019ve been going through a catastrophic life change. You need to learn who this new you is and get ready to start this new chapter in your life. Love will be there for you when you\u2019re ready.\n\nGood luck.\n\nHi Doc, Plenty of relationships sour due to bad circumstances. Enough to say people don\u2019t stay happy with their ex as a person. I (26f) fear it\u2019s in the way of me getting over mine (25m) because it has such intensity. The situation is confounding because it\u2019s so unexpected of my laid-back live-and-let-live approach to damn near everyone. I\u2019ll take it from the top. We were together for the best part of 4 years. Started off both as students at far flung colleges. The first 2.5 years were LDR; I took on most of the financial and logistical burden of this after I graduated and found employment. No recalibration occurred when he graduated into employment later. Then I moved away from my family and a satisfying job to be with him. I tried postgrad, it fell through and his parents, who offered me hospitality for a stint while I saved money to move out with their son, turfed me out after inventing some agreement about me staying in study that never happened. As it turns out, they didn\u2019t like me all that much anyway so I was baffled as to why they\u2019d offer me a room in their house. My ex flaked on moving out with me by ghosting my messages to him about rental listings and didn\u2019t really stick up to his parents. They called him an ingrate for proposing moving out at 24 years old, and he kinda just took it and stayed under their roof. I\u2019d call their behaviour manipulative and much too regularly exercised on their child but what do I know. I grew tired of the inequality. I was in debt and crying my way through work, wondering why my bf was acting distant and noncommittal. When I told him as much and left, he rattled off excuses to me that pretty much confirmed he had no understanding of the mental and financial strain I was under (not enough dates, I wasn\u2019t getting along with his parents, I wasn\u2019t fun, moving out was \u201cscary\u201d despite me doing it alone etc). I got a FWB a month later to distract me from the loss. Sounds heartless but I was willing to try anything. My ex claimed we were on a break and slut shamed me on social media (this was roundly debunked by everyone except his parents and swiftly deleted). He harassed me into a second chance, damn my caring arse for listening to him instead of cutting him out. Because in his version of reality I cheated, he was paranoid as hell. He\u2019d have issues with me mentioning men \u2014 difficult as I work in IT \u2014 and if I was out he\u2019d ask for selfies or demand that I shoehorn him into whatever conversation I\u2019m having. I made the mistake of being secretive to dodge the ridiculousness, which caused arguments, but I got better at communicating over time. After 6 months of seeming progress, he ghosted me for 3 days while he was out partying and dumped me with no explanation when he finally answered his phone. He was conveniently dating someone else 4 days later after blocking me and our mutual friends on social media just before he left, almost as if to cover his tracks. I was in a bad place and minutes from killing myself on what would have been our 4th anniversary. After a good samaritan had a smoke with me and sent me home I was forced into some sort of Sith\u2019s epiphany where hate would motivate me because love clearly failed. It worked pretty well through the really painful months. 7 months on I\u2019m in a happy relationship now and earning twice what my ex does after making strides at work. His formerly goody-two-shoes arse takes class A\u2019s multiple times a week and his gf broke up with him recently. No matter how much vindication, how much \u201cbetter at life\u201d I do than him, I hate him so much and anything that brings him joy; it\u2019s on my mind every day! Unfortunately, the Empire doesn\u2019t exist and I\u2019m not a supervillain so having a nemesis does me more harm than good. I am segregated from my ex bar the odd word from the grapevine and eye contact in public once or twice. I don\u2019t \u201cfuel the fire\u201d in any palpable ways like stalking his social media or friends. I\u2019m by all means dealing with it quite responsibly. What else can I do to help myself, it feels like an oddly long time for this to be affecting me so strongly still? Peace and love, Change The Record\n\nHere\u2019s my question for you, CTR: what, exactly, does this hate do for you? What benefits are you getting from holding on to this?\n\nI ask because anger is something that has to be maintained; it just takes too much from us in the long run and it tends to burn out on its own. Unless, of course, you go out of your way to feed it.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why you might want to feed that fire for a while. Anger and spite can be great motivating forces at first, but only for so long. Past a certain point, anger becomes destructive and malignant. Anger needs to be sustained, and it will almost always require more and more to keep that going. The same things you use to fuel the anger at first will no longer feed the fire as well or as efficiently.\n\nAs a result, either you go looking for other reasons to be angry at them, or turn that anger on other folks who often have nothing to do with the source of your anger in the first place. This is how you can go from \u201cmy ex was a shitty boyfriend and my relationship with him put me in a very bad place\u201d to \u201cLook at that arsehole, breathing air like he\u2019s got a right to it. How dare he continue to exist and eat crackers like that? And fuck his girlfriend too, keeping him from being miserable like he should be.\u201d\n\nSo what does being angry at him get you? You had a shitty experience with him and found yourself on a profound downward spiral because of your relationship, but all that\u2019s over. He\u2019s no longer part of your life, even tangentially. You\u2019ve pulled out of the bad place you found yourself in, and you haven\u2019t just bounced back but made significant strides towards an awesome new life. Seems to me like that initial anger has served its purpose and now all it\u2019s doing is festering and rotting inside you.\n\nAnd let\u2019s be honest: you are fuelling the fire. You may not be stalking his social media, but you clearly have been keeping tabs enough to know what misadventures he\u2019s been up to. The idea that things may make him happy keeps you up at night. That isn\u2019t healthy for you and honestly, it\u2019s just letting the ghosts of your past steal your happiness from the now.\n\nNone of this is to say that he didn\u2019t do things that warranted your being mad at him; he was clearly an arsehole. But carrying on that much of a grudge this far down the line? That\u2019s bordering on \u201cstaying angry for the sake of staying angry,\u201d especially since he\u2019s not in your life anymore. That\u2019s never going to be great for you or your mental and emotional health.\n\nThere are two things that I would suggest. The first is to forgive. If you can bring yourself to forgive him for his flagrant assholery then cool, do that. But you need to forgive yourself too \u2014 for choosing to date him, for choosing to go back, for the cheating on him. Forgiving yourself may be part of what empowers you to let go of this and move forward.\n\nThe other thing is simple: consign him to the memory hole. You two are long broken up and haven\u2019t lived together in months, but he\u2019s still living rent free in your head. You need to realise that your anger does nothing. It doesn\u2019t affect him in the slightest, nor does it bring you any benefit. All it does is burn, and it\u2019ll burn you from the inside out just as easily.\n\nIf he was as bad as all that, then he doesn\u2019t deserve your anger, he deserves your indifference. You may be broken up, but he\u2019s clearly still incredibly important to your life. The worst thing you can do to him isn\u2019t to psychically spit venom at him, it\u2019s to never think of him at all.\n\nSo let that anger go; it is no longer worth spending any of your precious mental bandwidth thinking about him, nor using any of your cells to store the memory of him. Allow the fires of your fury to bank down to coals and to finally burn out before tossing out the ashes of every memory you made with him with the garbage. Let him be unimportant and insignificant, a footnote in your history. He\u2019s simply not worth the effort it takes to remember him, let alone be angry at him.\n\nWith the fires of your past mistakes finally gone, you\u2019ll have the chance to see the possibilities of a greater future.\n\nGood luck.\n\n[email protected]\n\nHarris O\u2019Malley is a writer and dating coach who provides geek dating advice at his blog Paging Dr. NerdLove and the Dr. NerdLove YouTube channel.
