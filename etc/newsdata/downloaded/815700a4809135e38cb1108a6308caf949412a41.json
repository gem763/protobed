(ANG.JO) Monday reported a 52% on year rise in gross profit for the third quarter and reiterated its production guidance for the year.\n\nThe South Africa-based gold miner posted gross profit of $281 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\nAngloGold Ashanti produced 825,000 ounces of gold in the quarter compared with 851,000 ounces for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2018. It attributed the fall to the planned reduction in output from Cerro Vanguardia and Kibali.\n\nThe company said production for the year will be in the lower half of a 3.3 million to 3.5 million ounce range.\n\nCosts are expected to be at upper end of range, it said. All-in sustaining costs are forecast to be $935-$995 an ounce, while total cash costs are expected to be $730-$780.\n\nAngloGold said the sale processes for its businesses in South Africa are active and continue to make progress and that due diligence has started with prospective bidders for its Sadiola and Cerro Vanguardia businesses.\n\nWrite to Ian Walker at ian.walker@wsj.com; @IanWalk40289749\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 28, 2019 02:11 ET (06:11 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
