A local study showed 90 per cent of consumers who got retirement advice rated it as \u201cgood\u201d despite ASIC assessors rating only 3 per cent of the advice given at that level. And when an adviser discloses a conflict, we tend to trust them even more as a result of their candidness.\n\nWe\u2019re susceptible to pressure selling, we get overwhelmed by process, and we think companies that advertise regularly, or use a prominent spokesperson, have more credibility.\n\nWe struggle with complex disclosure \u2013 64 per cent of consumers couldn\u2019t find all the fees associated with a managed investment in a long-form product disclosure statement (PDS) \u2013 but did not do much better with simpler forms. A Monash University experiment with home insurance showed that just 40 per cent consumers who were given a \u201csimple\u201d key fact summary sheet selected objectively the best product, the same rate as those who had read the full PDS.\n\nFeatures of questionable value\n\nThe case studies also highlight how institutions have preyed on consumers' faults.\n\nProducts have been loaded with features of questionable value, exposing consumers to nasty surprises when they don't work as expected, and making it difficult to compare one product with another.\n\nBanks promote minimum credit card repayment amounts, even though experiments have shown this can increase the value of overall repayments by as much as 20 per cent \u2013 in an effect known as \u201canchoring\u201d \u2013 because consumers let their total debt balloon.\n\nInstitutions automatically roll us over in new products with worse conditions to take advantage of our inertia. Some pre-fill complex forms to allow us to make quick and poorly considered decisions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe report builds on work done in the Murray inquiry and particularly by the Hayne royal commission, which was heavily influenced by the work of Professor Sunita Sah of Cornell University on the many and varied ways in which conflicts emerge.\n\nASIC commissioner Karen Chester says the point of the study isn\u2019t to diminish that caveat emptor or personal responsibility. Rather, ASIC wants to reinforce how limited disclosure can be and to emphasise that it can't overcome our foibles as consumers.\n\nThe key, Chester argues, is the step before disclosure, which is covered under the new design and distribution obligations that were passed by federal parliament in April.\n\nThis requires institutions to design and sell products that meet consumer needs, which to Chester means getting rid of unnecessary complexity and what she describes as \u201csludge\u201d in the system, such as product features that aren\u2019t really needed by the target consumers, as well as poor sales and claims processes.\n\nGet the product design right \u2013 and ASIC\u2019s new product intervention powers give the regulator the chance to intervene in the case of those who don\u2019t \u2013 and the disclosure should become simpler. For example, it might involve a one-or-two-page summary sheet of a product's key features and risks, which is well written and has been tested to ensure it is leading to the right decisions.\n\nChester believes this regime is an insurance policy for firms. Design products correctly and get disclosure right, and you\u2019ll avoid the big remediation bills we are seeing now.\n\nAnd your consumers \u2013 with all their very human faults \u2013 should thank you for it, too.", "description": "A new report from the corporate regulator underscores the limits of disclosure and our own foibles as consumers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.8054%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_142/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ae6db5c6c98fcecd8b01cf77baaabe796c6b83c1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
