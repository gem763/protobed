If I didn't have any money and my wife was working all those hours I would do anything to make some money.\"\n\nDespite living a life of luxury for seven days, Sacha and Midia are determined to give their children a final treat.\n\nThey organise an early Christmas, with dozens of presents under the tree and Midia dressed as an elf.\n\nAnd then it's time for the experiment to end - but not before the families meet each other for the first time.\n\nSacha is keen to find out how Rob has made his money, while Rob wants to impart his own words of wisdom to the student dad - and it isn't what he wants to hear.\n\nRob says: \"I take my hat off to Midia, I don't think you know how lucky you are.\n\n\"I admire what you have done by going back to university but you should have made that two days a week, or night school, or the Open University and you should be working and bringing home the bacon.\n\n\"You should have made sure your son and daughter have a computer they can use for their studies.\n\n\"And these inventions that you have done and entertaining but they're not from the real world.\"\n\nAfter filming had finished, Sacha hit back at Rob's comments, insisting he HAD worked while he was a student and was doing everything he could for his family.\n\nHe told Mirror Online: \"The comments were unfair and were spoken without full knowledge of my life.\n\n\"I thought he could have given me a chance to explain myself or asked a few questions before he branded me lazy.\"\n\nSacha, who has now finished his course, is job hunting but is also working part-time as a truck driver.\n\nHe says Midia quit her job as soon as her course finished.\n\nSacha added: \"In our 20 year marriage, Midia has only worked for about five years.\n\n\"She was a housewife and was working to raise our family. I have always worked hard and provided for my wife and children.\n\n\"While I was studying I was working part-time in the breaks from school because we wouldn't have been able pay the rent if I hadn't.\n\n\"I've always given 110 percent for my family and I've always tried my best.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Self-made businessman Rob Jones says Sacha Johnson \"isn't living in the real world\" by not providing for his family in Channel 5's Rich House, Poor House", "authors": ["Jane Lavender"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20714560.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHP_241019SLUG_6984JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
