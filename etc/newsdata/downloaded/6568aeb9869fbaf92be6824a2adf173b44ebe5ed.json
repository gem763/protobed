Charles Brown, the commander of the U.S. Pacific Air Forces, told Pentagon reporters on Monday. \"U.S. bombers are no longer conducting flights over South Korea after Seoul asked for such missions to be paused,\" according to AFP. A military officer here confirmed that no U.S. bombers have flown to Korea since late November last year.\n\nEarlier, military authorities here denied the reports. Then-Defense Minister Song Young-moo in March told the visiting commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in March, \"The U.S. doesn't need to send strategic assets to Korea.\" But the ministry claimed Song had been joking. He has since lost his job.\n\nIn May, the U.S. military planned a joint drill with South Korea and send B-52 strategic bombers but changed its mind and only conducted a scaled-down drill on its own because of Seoul's concern that it could heighten tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the Wall Street Journal reported. But the ministry denied that report too.\n\n", "description": "U.S. 'Halted Bomber Missions at Seoul's Request'", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2018/11/28/2018112801502_0.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-28"}
