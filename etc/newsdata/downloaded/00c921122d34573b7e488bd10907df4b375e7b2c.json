When he realized what had happened, Parks placed his belt around Springer\u2019s leg to stanch the flow of blood, then called 911.\n\n\u201cThe dog shot her?\u201d the 911 operator is heard asking Parks in the audio recording. \u201cYeah,\u201d Parks replied, adding that \u201che stepped on it and it went off.\u201d\n\nLater in the recording, Springer is heard crying in pain from the wound and Parks tells her \u201cCome off of it. You\u2019re tougher than that. I know.\u201d\n\nOnce emergency crews arrived, Springer was taken to St. Mary\u2019s Regional Medical Center for treatment.\n\nSgt. Robert Norton of the Enid Police Department said he has never seen anything quite like it. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of a dog shooting a woman,\u201d he commented.\n\nPolice said the fabric on the seat covers also could have gotten into the trigger well, causing it to fire. Additionally, Parks told authorities that he does not usually keep the gun loaded.\n\nPolice said both Parks and Springer\u2019s stories regarding the incident checked out and that the evidence at the scene gave them no cause to suspect foul play.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important whenever you\u2019re transporting firearms to make sure, especially that they\u2019re in a secure location,\u201d Norton concluded.", "description": "A woman in Enid, Oklahoma, was shot in the leg on Thursday when a dog jumped on top of a gun inside a vehicle she was in, causing it to fire.", "authors": ["Amy Furr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/11/11272017-TCA-AJO-Weapon-.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
