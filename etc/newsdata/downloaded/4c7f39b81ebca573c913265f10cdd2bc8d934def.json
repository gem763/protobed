Whereas if you were to add more white sugar you would wind up with a crispier cookie.\n\nButter\n\nBefore you add butter to the mix, always remember to soften it first to room temperature. Trying to mix cold butter into a dough is no fun!\n\nSoftening the butter not only makes it easier to cream together with the other ingredients, but it also makes for a better cookie flavor and texture.\n\nFor a thicker, denser cookie, use melted or browned butter. We like to mix brown butter in with softened butter to get a chewy dense cookie, but with crisp edges (best of both worlds!). Plus, that incredible caramel, nutty brown butter flavor.\n\nIf you like a thin and crispy cookie \u2026 use more granulated sugar and more butter.\n\nIf you like more thick and chunky cookie \u2026 use more brown sugar and browned or melted butter.\n\nIf you like caky cookies, you can add about 10% more flour as well.\n\nYou Can Skip the Chocolate Chips\n\nDon\u2019t limit yourself to packaged chocolate chips. If you want to make the ultimate chocolate chip cookies, then it's time to step out of the box (or bag!) a bit and cut your own chocolate.\n\nCut the chocolate yourself using a serrated knife, and don't worry about getting pieces of exactly the same size.\n\nUsing chopped chocolate not only tastes superior, but it will give the cookies a great texture. The bigger chunks will give your cookies those great pools of chocolate and the smaller pieces and shavings will give you flecks of chocolate throughout the whole cookie.\n\nPlus, you can even get creative with it and use different types of chocolate!\n\nBittersweet, dark-dark, semi-sweet and milk chocolate all have their own unique flavor that pairs beautifully when added together.\n\nOnce you sink your teeth into a warm, chewy cookie with chunks of perfect chocolate, you'll never use chips again.\n\nUse an Ice Cream Scoop\n\nHave you ever noticed that when you don't shape the dough and simply plopped each dollop down that some wind up more crisp on the outside or under-cooked in the middle? That's because they are all different sizes.\n\nWhile varying sizes can look great, they don't all cook evenly on the sheet pan, which is what causes them to be cooked with varying results even though they were baked in the same batch.\n\nBy using a cookie scoop or shaping dough into relatively the same size by hand, the cookies will get a more uniform shape -- and bake evenly no matter where they\u2019re placed on the pan.\n\nUnless you like doughy middles and burnt edges, use an ice cream scoop to portion out your dough so the cookies bake to perfection.\n\nDouble the recipe and pop extras in the freezer\n\nWe believe that you should always have some cookie dough in your freezer to have on hand if a guest comes over or if you just want a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.", "description": "The Bon App\u00e9tit team has time and again proved their expertly developed \"BA's best\" recipes reign supreme, so it comes as no surprise that their chocolate chip cookie is so sweet.
