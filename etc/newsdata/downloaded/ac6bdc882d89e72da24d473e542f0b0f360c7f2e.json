With all the same Google Assistant capabilities and a more affordable, $49 price, the Google Home Mini proved to be one of Google's best sellers.\n\nNow, the company is announcing a new version of their smallest smart speaker. It's called the Nest Mini, as Google moves toward a Nest-branded line of smart-home devices that includes the Nest Hello, Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max.\n\nThe Nest Mini looks very similar to the Google Home Mini, but there are sure to be differences inside. Stay tuned for updates to this post as the event continues.", "description": "The Google Home Mini gets a new name with its second generation.
