It also comes after Markle took legal action against a newspaper in response to what the royal couple described as \"bullying\" by some sections of British media.\n\n\"On occasion, stories and headlines have represented an invasion of your privacy and have sought to cast aspersions about your character \u2014 without any good reason as far as we can see,\" said the letter published by the office of Labour's Holly Lynch.\n\n\"Even more concerning still, we are calling out what can be described as outdated, colonial undertones to some of these stories. As women Members of Parliament from all backgrounds, we stand with you in saying it cannot be allowed to go unchallenged,\" it continued.\n\nIn the letter, signed by 71 women MPs, the parliamentarians vow to do everything they can to make sure the press respects the duchess' privacy.\n\nIn the ITV documentary, Markle opened up about her friends warning her against British tabloids and how they would destroy her life.\n\nMarkle is currently suing the Mail on Sunday, accusing it of breach of privacy and copyright after it published a story with extracts of a private letter from the duchess to her father, Thomas Markle.
