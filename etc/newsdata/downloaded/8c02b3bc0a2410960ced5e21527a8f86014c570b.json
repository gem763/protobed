The company argued that the CER should wait until after contracts are signed to intervene.\n\nEnbridge had called on its shippers \u2014 a combination of oil producers and refiners \u2014 to sign long-term contracts on 90 per cent of the space available on its Mainline. The Mainline system has never operated under long-term contracts and has functioned for years as the Canadian oil industry\u2019s de facto spot market.\n\nThe CER found that Enbridge is currently \u201cin a dominant position in the market\u201d and the regulator expressed its \u201cconcerns regarding the fairness\u201d about the move to re-contract the line now, when \u201cmany potential shippers may have little choice\u201d but to participate.\n\n\u201cShippers have few alternative transportation options at this time, and the open season is not in support of expansion pipeline capacity,\u201d the CER wrote in its decision, posted after markets closed Friday afternoon.\n\nDespite the unfavourable decision, Enbridge said it is still committed to contracting the Mainline.\n\n\u201cEnbridge remains committed to moving ahead with contract carriage on the Mainline and has strong support for our offering. We will evaluate this decision and the next steps that we will take towards implementing contract carriage,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nARC Energy Research Institute senior director Jackie Forrest said Canadian oil producers were, with a few exceptions, opposed to Enbridge\u2019s attempt to contract the system at this time. \u201cThe vast majority of the industry was opposed to this open season,\u201d she said.\n\nForrest said the CER made the case that this kind of intervention was justified. \u201cI don\u2019t think they had a set of circumstances as compelling as this,\u201d Forrest said.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by the small- and mid-sized oil and gas producers represented by Explorers and Producers Association of Canada.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very pleased with the timeliness of the decision,\u201d EPAC president Tristan Goodman said of the halt to the open season. \u201cWe think it\u2019s good news for Canadians. We look forward to working with Enbridge going forward.\u201d\n\nThis was the solution that the industry wanted. This is a big win. Dale Nally, Alberta\u2019s Associate Minister for Natural Gas\n\nIn an earlier decision Friday, CER will allow TC Energy to change how it operates its Nova gas pipeline system during periods of maintenance or construction \u2013 granting the requests of the Alberta government and 23 gas producers that said natural gas in the province couldn\u2019t get into storage under the old system.\n\nBetter access to storage is seen as a critically important factor in preventing further bankruptcies by gas producers.\n\nThe move had been opposed by two U.S. trading houses, a Spanish utility company and a fertilizer company. They argued the change would occur too quickly and that the Alberta government was picking winners and losers in the market.\n\nAfter a one-day hearing Wednesday, the CER issued its decision two days later without providing the rationale for the decision. The CER said TC Energy can implement the new system beginning Sept. 30.\n\n\u201cThe Commission is releasing the decision now, in advance of the reasons, in response to the requests from NGTL and other parties for an expedited decision,\u201d the CER wrote in its decision, released one day after lawyers and gas executives packed into a hearing room for a one-day opportunity to present arguments on the topic.\n\nThe sector had been divided for the last two years about the operation of the Nova system but has come together over the course of 2019 to push for the solution that was approved Friday.\n\n\u201cThis was the solution that the industry wanted,\u201d Alberta\u2019s Associate Minister for Natural Gas Dale Nally said following the CER\u2019s release of the decision. \u201cThis is a big win.\u201d\n\nNally said that there had previously been divisions within the gas sector about how to fix the issue of extreme volatility in the domestic gas market, where AECO natural gas prices fluctuate between $3 per thousand cubic feet and 10 cents per mcf in the same week.\n\nThe volatility in the market has driven many investors away from Canada\u2019s gas sector.\n\nThe protocol change will result in less volatility and there\u2019s no doubt that too much volatility \u2026 affected investment capital flowing into the province Mike Rose, president and CEO of Tourmaline Oil Corp.\n\n\u201cThe protocol change will result in less volatility and there\u2019s no doubt that too much volatility \u2013 which we\u2019ve been seeing the past couple summers \u2013 affected investment capital flowing into the province,\u201d said Mike Rose, president and CEO of Tourmaline Oil Corp.\n\n\u201cI think it makes investors, when they see something more stable, they\u2019re more willing to invest,\u201d Rose said.\n\nEPAC\u2019s Goodman said he couldn\u2019t remember a time when the country\u2019s pipeline regulator had to make two highly important pipeline decisions on the country\u2019s biggest pipelines in such a short time frame \u2013 let alone on the same day.\n\nHe acknowledged there\u2019s been some friction within the energy industry on both fronts, including some disagreements between oil and gas producers and their main pipeline providers.\n\n\u201cAs those lines have continued to get tighter because capacity is limited, there has been ongoing debate as to the best way to efficiently use those lines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t survive without us. We can\u2019t survive without them,\u201d Goodman said of the relationship between the upstream and the midstream sectors of the Canadian oil and gas industry but added the producers and their pipeline operators agree more than they disagree on major issues.\n\n\u2022 Email: gmorgan@nationalpost.com | Twitter: geoffreymorgan", "description": "The decisions will cause significant changes to the day-to-day operations of the energy sector", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/pipes.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
