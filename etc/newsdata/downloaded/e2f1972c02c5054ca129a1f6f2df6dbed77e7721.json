In that case, Trump has sought to block a subpoena for his tax returns \u2014 using the precedent-shattering argument that a sitting president shouldn\u2019t be investigated by any prosecutor, for any reason, anywhere.\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department didn\u2019t explicitly embrace Trump\u2019s broad arguments. But it did urge the judge in the case to take extra time to consider them, given \u201cthe weighty constitutional issues involved.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Justice Department has long defended presidents when they\u2019ve been sued. Now it is also jumping in to support Trump when he sues others \u2014 backing him up as he pushes for an expansion of presidential immunity.\n\n\u201cThe DOJ has elected to insert itself into this private lawsuit to support [Trump\u2019s] extravagant claim\u201d of presidential privilege, District Attorney Cyrus Vance (D) wrote in a letter to the judge Thursday.\n\nVance accused the Justice Department of helping Trump avoid investigation, by playing for time: \u201c[Trump\u2019s] only goal in this litigation, now supported by the DOJ itself, is to obtain as much delay as possible, through litigation, stays, and appeals.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSome critics of Trump are hoping that the new impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats \u2014 while not connected to any of these existing suits \u2014 may help speed their path through the federal judiciary. The argument would be that, if Congress needs to know something about Trump\u2019s private conduct, now is the time.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe clock is ticking on this presidential term,\u201d said Brianne Gorod, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which is seeking records about Trump\u2019s private business dealings with foreign governments. \u201cWhere the House is seeking information that is relevant to its determination whether to impeach the president, it needs that information as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s too early to tell whether that will be the case \u2014 or if, instead, the House\u2019s focus on a separate investigation into Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine will sap the urgency from these cases.\n\nAD\n\nDuring Trump\u2019s term, federal lawyers have defended him against three lawsuits alleging he is violating the Constitution by continuing to do business with foreign governments through his family business. Two of those lawsuits, which focus on the Constitution\u2019s \u201cforeign emoluments\u201d clause, are still pending. Another was dismissed, but the plaintiffs are asking for a rehearing.\n\nAD\n\nBut, under Trump, the department has also taken on an expanded role \u2014 as legal firepower to a highly litigious president, who has carried over his longtime habit of using lawsuits to stymie his enemies.\n\nFor Trump, \u201cthe idea is to beat the system,\u201d even if he can\u2019t beat the cases, said James D. Zirin, a former federal prosecutor and the author of a new book called \u201cPlaintiff in Chief: A Portrait of Donald Trump in 3,500 Lawsuits.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019ll achieve delay. . . . The wheels of justice grind very slowly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJay Sekulow, a private attorney for Trump, said his team consults with the Justice Department when necessary. The team Sekulow oversees has the job of advocating for the president\u2019s personal interests. The Justice Department has an interest in preserving executive authority.\n\nThe two confer, he said, when Trump\u2019s personal arguments intersect in some way with presidential power. He noted that, in two cases, a judge actually asked the Justice Department if it wanted to intervene.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAny discussions that would take place would be because of the institutional interests the Justice Department would have regarding legal issues we had raised, to include, [constitutional] authority, separation of powers, among other things,\u201d Sekulow said. He said the consultations usually involve William Consovoy, another private attorney for Trump, and James M. Burnham, a deputy assistant attorney general.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe courts have asked for the views of the Justice Department, which is typical in these kinds of cases, going back to President Clinton,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nIn two other cases, the Justice Department has supported Trump as he seeks to block congressional investigations of his finances \u2014 by suing the committees investigating him, and suing the companies the committees subpoenaed for records.\n\nAD\n\nOne of those cases involves a House Oversight Committee subpoena to Trump\u2019s accountants, Mazars USA, seeking his tax returns.\n\nThe other involves subpoenas to two of Trump\u2019s banks, Deutsche Bank and Capital One, seeking documents related to loans he received.\n\nAD\n\nIn both cases, Trump said the subpoenas are invalid because they lack a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d \u2014 that is, they\u2019re not tied to pending legislation. The argument is that Congress should not investigate the president\u2019s conduct; that\u2019s a job for prosecutors.\n\n\u201cA congressional demand for the President\u2019s personal records raises the specter that members of the Legislative Branch are impermissibly attempting to interfere with or harass the Head of the Executive Branch,\u201d according to a Justice Department brief filed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit as part of the case involving Mazars USA.\n\nAD\n\nIn that filing, Justice Department attorneys echoed arguments made by Trump\u2019s privately paid attorneys. They said Congress \u201cmay not issue a subpoena for purposes of \u2018law enforcement.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nSo far, federal judges have rejected Trump\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cCongress plainly views itself as having sweeping authority to investigate illegal conduct of a President, before and after taking office,\u201d U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta wrote in Washington in refusing to block the House subpoena for Trump\u2019s accounting firm records. \u201cThis court is not prepared to roll back the tide of history.\u201d\n\nBut the cases aren\u2019t over. The subpoenas are on hold. In both cases, Trump appealed his losses to federal circuit courts.\n\nThe Justice Department also advised the Treasury Department to refuse a request from the House Ways and Means Committee to inspect Trump\u2019s tax returns. The law says the returns must be turned over when requested.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut the Justice Department still said no: Its reasoning was again that there was no \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d behind the request, so it was not valid. Democrats have sued to get the returns, and that case is still pending.\n\nIn the Manhattan district attorney suit, Trump\u2019s private attorneys have turned their arguments from those other lawsuits inside out. Before, they said Congress should not obtain Trump\u2019s records because that job was reserved for prosecutors.\n\nIn this separate case, Trump\u2019s private attorneys have said prosecutors shouldn\u2019t obtain them. That job, they said, was reserved for Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Framers eliminated this possibility, and assigned the task to \u2026 Congress\u201d by creating the impeachment process, Trump\u2019s private attorneys wrote. They asked a judge to stop the subpoena: \u201cBecause [Vance\u2019s] subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting president, it is unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVance\u2019s investigation is focused on hush-money payments made just before the 2016 election to two women who said they had sexual encounters with Trump. He has denied having relationships with the women.\n\nTrump\u2019s former attorney and \u201cfixer,\u201d Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations for helping arrange those payments. Cohen said he\u2019d been reimbursed by the Trump Organization. Federal prosecutors later effectively concluded their investigation without charging anyone else at the company.\n\nAfter that, Vance\u2019s office \u2014 which has the power to bring charges in New York state courts \u2014 began asking for documents related to the payments, as well as seeking tax returns for Trump and his businesses from Mazars.\n\nVance has rejected Trump\u2019s arguments, saying the president is seeking to \u201cinvent and enforce a new presidential \u2018tax return privilege\u2019 \u201d that would bar anyone from seeing his returns. \u201cNo such privilege exists in the law,\u201d Vance\u2019s office wrote.\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s filing in the case doesn\u2019t explicitly support Trump\u2019s assertion of immunity from investigation. Instead, it urges District Judge Victor Marrero to slow the case down, keep the subpoenas on hold and listen carefully to Trump\u2019s arguments.\n\nVance\u2019s office has said the Justice Department is overstepping its bounds, and infringing on \u201cthe State\u2019s sovereign right to enforce its criminal laws free from federal interference.\u201d\n\nLegal experts have said Trump\u2019s arguments are a sharp departure from existing precedent: In the 1970s, for instance, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that President Nixon had to turn over Oval Office tape recordings sought by prosecutors.\n\n\u201cWhat [Trump is] asking for, it seems implicitly, is for lower federal courts to ignore U.S. v. Nixon, or ultimately for the Supreme Court to overrule U.S. v. Nixon,\u201d said Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University.\n\nIn his lawsuit against Vance, Trump cited a 2018 blog post written by Shugerman \u2014 quoting a line saying that presidents can\u2019t do their job well if they\u2019re being prosecuted.\n\nBut Shugerman said Trump is misconstruing his argument. He believes presidents shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted while in office \u2014 hauled out of Washington and into a courtroom. But Shugerman said that doesn\u2019t mean presidents can\u2019t be investigated, for possible prosecution after they leave office.\n\nIf presidents can\u2019t even be investigated, he said, that might incentivize them toward worse behavior.\n\n\u201cIt creates a perverse incentive for a president to then break more laws to get reelected,\u201d since the president would face no investigation for those, either, Shugerman said. \u201cIt gives him carte blanche as long as he wins two terms.\u201d\n\nRobert Barnes, Carol D.
