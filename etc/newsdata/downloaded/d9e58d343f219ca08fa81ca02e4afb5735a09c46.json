Known as Satoshi\u2019s Treasure, college students will have the chance to search for a $1 million BTC prize.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s Treasure Is Here for Players to Enjoy\n\nSatoshi\u2019s Treasure is operated, as one source puts it, by a \u201cmysterious company based on a tropical island.\u201d Thus, it\u2019s important to note right away that there\u2019s likely to be some risk involved with the venture. Not much is known about the company beforehand, so students should probably be a little wary, though figuring out the company\u2019s identity is allegedly part of the game.\n\nThe entire event is sponsored by Primitive Ventures. Hundreds of separate cryptographic keys will be placed in several hidden locations throughout the globe. It is up to the students participating in the game to find as many as they can. Representative state students will be able to claim the price once they find up to 400 keys and splice them together.\n\nAt press time, about 40 separate clues have been released regarding the locations of these keys, and as many as 100,000 students have signed up for email updates regarding additional evidence and game participation rules.\n\nThe game\u2019s co-creator Eric Meltzer explained in a statement:\n\nA lot of these students want to learn about blockchain and crypto, but their universities haven\u2019t caught up with them yet. We\u2019re looking to provide resources for a lot of these different student groups.\n\nThe game will begin with a North American tour of approximately 20 college campuses which will feature what the creators call \u201cmini hunts\u201d and educational meetups that focus on decentralized exchanges and crypto wallet technology.\n\nJonathan Calso, who heads a blockchain group at the University of Michigan, says that these workshops are great networking opportunities for students looking to get noticed by schools\u2019 engineering divisions. He states:\n\nThis helps us get more visibility from the engineering department, economics and computer science departments as well. The clues incentivize you to discover new websites and tools\u2026 to play around with a bitcoin wallet a bit and to see what the technology can do.\n\nBringing in Outside Players\n\nCo-founder of the game Jessica Wang says that she\u2019s coordinating activity amongst several university representatives in Asia and Oceania to help students abroad become involved if they so choose.
