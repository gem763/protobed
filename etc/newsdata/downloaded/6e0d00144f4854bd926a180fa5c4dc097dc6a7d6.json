It\u2019s put on by the nation\u2019s public broadcaster, financed by all of us, presumably to occupy itself with our common, national problems. When it turns its attention to a federal election you\u2019d think the question preoccupying it would be: what\u2019s best for the good of us all? Yet the clearest theme to emerge from two nights of \u201ccarefully selected\u201d citizens interviewing Justin Trudeau on Monday and Andrew Scheer on Tuesday was \u201cme, me, me, me.\u201d What are you and your party going to do, sir, not for the good of the country, but for me and my particular concern?\n\nAfter several decades of politicians pandering to the interest groups they have divided us all into perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that we do all now act, not so much as Canadians, but as representatives of our group or region, whatever it may be, and that we respond to the serial panderers by demanding whatever favours we think we can get out of them.\n\nMaybe it was the editing, and maybe it\u2019s human nature, but most of the remarkably self-possessed citizen-questioners used their few minutes of face time with the leaders to raise matters that affect them directly and on which they would like the federal government\u2019s help, whether or not Ottawa has either the slightest jurisdiction over the problem that concerns them or the power to fix it.\n\nA young mother from Alberta told Trudeau how much her part of the country was hurting as a result of oil troubles \u2014 an expression of a local concern that may actually be good for the country if it reduces Trudeau\u2019s own parochial focus on \u201cvote-rich\u201d central Canada. A young entrepreneur from Vancouver wanted to know where she would get the million dollars she needed to buy a house in her city. (A 40-something father had the same question for Scheer. Of 10 \u201ccarefully selected\u201d Canadians, two are in the same real estate market? Really?)\n\nTrudeau answered that if he\u2019s re-elected, eligibility for first-time buyer\u2019s equity-sharing would be extended in Vancouver, Victoria and Toronto to properties worth up to $800,000. The woman swatted that aside, $800,000 barely getting you a garage in Vancouver. The father did the same to Scheer\u2019s suggestion that his green renovation plan would help, saying he and his wife were renters. I was surprised Scheer didn\u2019t pull a renters\u2019 assistance plan out of his back pocket.\n\nWatching all this, you wonder why anyone goes into politics. In our household, the answer to the Vancouver house-seekers would have been \u201cMove somewhere else, if you can\u2019t afford to buy where you are!\u201d Pierre Trudeau might well have said something like that. But in this day and age, almost no matter what people say to them, politicians have to seem interested and empathetic. Somebody\u2019s bound to be filming their reaction.\n\nAs we know, Trudeau is extremely good at empathy, looking people straight in the eye as they tell their stories, his brow furrowing in concern and sympathy. But Scheer was surprisingly good, too. It\u2019s often said that, given their sometimes stern message, conservatives need to smile more and be friendlier than liberals, Ronald Reagan being the all-time exemplar. Scheer is no Reagan, and his message isn\u2019t actually that stern, but he does smile a lot and this otherwise annoying tendency helped him come across as friendly and sympathetic, while still pitching the conservative messages that there has to be value-for-money in government and that people\u2019s tax dollars are first and foremost theirs.\n\nBut you never satisfy everyone. An affable, articulate New Brunswicker who shares an interest with Scheer in whisky that it would have been fun to hear more about wanted action to stop his property from being flooded again after several inundations in the past few years. Now, if you\u2019re on a flood plain and the flooding is getting worse, the common sense answer is that maybe you need to move. Instead the questioner seemed to want Scheer to end global warming now. Scheer made the right noises in a smiling and sympathetic way that enabled him to escape without having to say outright what should be obvious: if global warming is your overriding concern, my party isn\u2019t really your best choice.\n\nThe National\u2019s website says the citizen-questioners were \u201ccarefully selected from across the country and represent the diversity of the electorate groups \u2014 regionally, racially and ethnically, socio-economic, different ages, different priorities.\u201d Out of 10 questioners over two nights, two (or 20 per cent) were Indigenous, which is four times the Aboriginal share of Canada\u2019s population (4.9 per cent). Another four (40 per cent) were visible minority, which is just under double the visible minority share of the population. (One asked Trudeau about brownface, another asked Scheer about Faith Goldy.) One questioner, lo and behold, was a dairy farmer \u2014 though there are only 10,679 dairy farms in Canada, giving them just 0.03 per cent of the population.\n\nThe gold standard for public opinion surveys is random selection. The National\u2019s panels may have been representative of \u201cthe electorate groups\u201d but they were decidedly not random. The program\u2019s producers evidently think of us, not as one nation, but as an assembly of factions. Maybe it should change its name to The Factional.", "description": "After decades of politicians pandering to us as special interest groups, we respond by demanding whatever favours we think we can get out of them", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/scheer.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
