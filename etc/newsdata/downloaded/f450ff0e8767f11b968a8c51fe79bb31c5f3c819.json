Investors who hand their money over to companies to fund their activities, and take risks by doing so, ought to be rewarded. The dividend is an important part of that.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.\n\nDan Coatsworth, stockmarket analyst at AJ Bell, makes the point that there are some sizeable companies on AIM and a lot of those paying dividends operate in sectors that don\u2019t require oodles of capital, such as the media, finance or support services.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the FTSE 250 you\u2019ll see a universe of more mature businesses, which generate sufficient cash to reinvest in their business and pay dividends,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen you move up to the FTSE 100, if you exclude Scottish Mortgage, an investment trust that invests in other companies, 97 out of the 99 companies offer a payment.\n\nBut can you have too much of a good thing? Are UK companies too focussed on their payouts at the expensive of investment. You could certainly make the case.\n\nIt goes without saying that the UK has a fairly poor record when it comes to business investment, particularly when compared with European countries such as Germany, where payouts have historically been lower.\n\nThe oft-discussed skills gap is partly a function of that. In this column last week, I highlighted an Opinium survey for consultant PwC, which found that only about half of Britain\u2019s workers get the opportunity to undertake training despite strong demand among them for it. This country was at the bottom of 13 countries included in a fairly exhaustive study.\n\nFocussing on keeping shareholders sweet at the expense of the long-term health of their businesses is ultimately a self-defeating strategy. It\u2019s also economically damaging.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t prevent it from happening, particularly in cases where a CEO\u2019s bonus is linked to the payout, as sometimes happens.\n\nCan anything be done about this?\n\nGordon Brown, the former Labour chancellor, said he wanted to address the issue when he scrapped pension funds\u2019 dividend tax credit. This deprived final salary schemes, which offer workers guaranteed pensions, of billions of pounds, hastening their closure in favour of less generous \u201cmoney purchase\u201d schemes. They put all the risk on employees and are now the norm in the private sector.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies found little evidence that the measure had done anything to encourage business investment several years after the event. Meanwhile, while it was interrupted by the financial crisis, the dividend train has just kept on rolling.\n\nBrown\u2019s critics have long argued his real intent with this \u201csmash-and-grab raid on pension funds\u201d was to boost the exchequer rather than boost business investment. He denied that but, in my view, they\u2019re probably right.\n\nIf a future government genuinely wants to encourage investment, and that would be a good thing, it may be wise to rely upon subtler means, involving some carrot as well as a stick.\n\nIn the meantime, the dividend train looks set to keep on rolling until the next economic shock.\n\nCompanies hate cutting their payouts, but with Brexit rapidly approaching and the world\u2019s economy slowing, it\u2019s on the way.\n\nThe extended party investors have enjoyed may soon be over.", "description": "Investors on the hunt for dividends are having a fine old time of it.\u00a0 Broker AJ Bell recently found 20 FTSE 350 (which includes the blue chip FTSE 100 and the second tier FTSE 250 indices) companies that have managed to increase their payouts by more than inflation over every year of the past decade, with the average annual hike ranging from a stunning 34 per cent (in the", "authors": ["James Moore"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/01/21/17/markets.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
