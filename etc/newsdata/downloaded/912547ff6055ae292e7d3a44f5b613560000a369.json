Interviews were held and this information helped set the terms of reference for a QC-led review of the charity.\n\nThe commission found that the governance failures did not contribute to the occurrence of the serious incident or how the victim was supported but the report did identify a number of failings. These included poor communication and a lack of training in key areas such as governance and staff welfare. Many staff felt they were not managed well by the senior management team, with some feeling overworked and inadequately supported.\n\nA series of recommendations have been made and Kick It Out now has a new chair - Sanjay Bhandari - and three other new trustees in post.\n\n\u201cThe trustees of Kick It Out should have made protecting those who came into contact with their charity from harm a governance priority,\u201d said Tracy Howarth, the Charity Commission\u2019s head of regulatory compliance.", "description": "Football\u2019s equality charity, Kick It Out, was found to have governance failures after concerns were raised last year about safeguarding, bullying and harassment.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/30/TELEMMGLPICT000213491724-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqIi6aBi2c7zhHUtuESauS5Y2WSUlKz5WIKvXggmoGaFA.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-31"}
