One of the crashed D-21s was put on display at Beijing's Military Museum a few years ago.\n\nThe DR-8 reconnaissance drone has a role in assessing the strike impact of China's \"aircraft carrier killer\", the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, and the DF-26 ballistic missile.\n\nAccording to Zhou Chenming, a Beijing-based military commentator, the DR-8 could travel faster than the D-21 - whose maximum speed is Mach 3.3 - letting it penetrate the enemy's air defences and return intact with intelligence. The PLA had been using the drone - which can reach strategic locations as far away as the Western Pacific, including Guam - for some time, according to Shanghai-based military commentator Shi Lao.\n\n\"In fact, this UAV [the DR-8] entered into service a while ago,\" Shi said.\n\nThe other drone to watch at the parade, which will mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, is the Sharp Sword - an attack drone that can carry several missiles or laser-guided bombs.\n\nAlso spotted in the rehearsal photos was China's hypersonic DF-17 missile, which can deliver a manoeuvrable re-entry vehicle capable of shifting targets in flight.\n\nRead more: China is deploying drones to spy on the South China Sea like never before\n\nThe DF-41 will also be part of the huge military parade - a solid-fuel, road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile that can carry up to 10 nuclear warheads and hit targets on the US mainland.\n\nThe PLA Air Force also rolled out a new strategic bomber, the H-6N, during the rehearsal on Sunday. Observers said that the bomber's most notable feature was an aerial refuelling receptacle.\n\nThat will enable the aircraft, which was modelled on the Soviet Tu-16 jet bomber, to carry out in-flight refuelling - significantly boosting its operating range compared to its predecessor, the H-6K.\n\nA previously undisclosed lightweight battle tank, the Type 15, was also seen during the parade rehearsals.\n\n\"There will be some exciting new weaponry on show at the parade this year,\" Zhou said.", "description": "Photos and videos circulating online show at least two types of unmanned aerial vehicles on display.", "authors": ["Liu Zhen", "South China Morning Post"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8094ce2e22af39cb58a6a2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
