This historically accurate model predicts exactly that", "language": "en", "text": "President Donald Trump has a love/hate relationship with polls, surveys and predictions. He loves the ones that paint him in a positive light, and, of course, he hates all those \u201cfake\u201d ones that don\u2019t.\n\nHe\u2019s going to absolutely adore this one.\n\nAccording to Moody\u2019s Analytics, Trump is headed toward another four years in the White House. And, if the numbers are right, it won\u2019t even be close.\n\nIn fact, his Electoral College victory could very well be wider than the 304-227 margin he enjoyed over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nSince 1980, Moody\u2019s has managed to nail the outcome every time but once \u2014 like many, it didn\u2019t see Trump coming.\n\n\u201cIn our post-mortem of the 2016 presidential election model,\u201d the report said, \u201cwe determined that unexpected turnout patterns were one of the factors that contributed to the model\u2019s first incorrect election prediction.\u201d Here\u2019s Moody\u2019s track record, including a 2016 adjustment for the turnout variable:\n\nWill it return to its winning ways? The team takes into account how consumers feel about their finances, the performance of the stock market SPX, +1.00% and their job prospects. Essentially, today, they\u2019re feeling pretty good.\n\n\u201cUnder the current Moody\u2019s Analytics baseline economic outlook, which does not forecast any recession, the 2020 election looks like Trump\u2019s to lose,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cDemocrats can still win if they are able to turn out the vote at record levels, but, under normal turnout conditions, the president is projected to win.\u201d\n\nFrom the MarketWatch archives (August 2016): To professional economists, Trump isn\u2019t even the second best candidate in the 2016 presidential election\n\nMoody\u2019s uses three models to come up with its forecast. In each case, Trump gets at least 289 Electoral College votes.\n\nThe \u201cpocketbook\u201d measure, which focus on how people feel about their money situation, is where Trump shines brightest, grabbing a whopping 351 electoral votes. \u201cIf voters were to vote primarily on the basis of their pocketbooks, the president would steamroll the competition,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe stock-market model gives him the slightest edge of 289-249, as investors continue to navigate a volatile investing landscape. Then there\u2019s the unemployment model, which leans heavily in his favor at 332-206.\n\nSee: Former GOP presidential candidate: Every Democratic debate is a Trump win", "description": "President Donald Trump has a love/hate relationship with polls, surveys and predictions.
