This jumped to 962 in 2018/19 \u2013 an increase of 22 per cent.\n\nThis is likely to be the tip of the iceberg, as many thefts go unreported and little more than half of police forces responded to the FOI request.\n\nAmazon Crime: There were 2,578 parcel thefts that were reported to 23 police forces across the country\n\nThe area with the highest level of stolen parcels - of the forces that responded - was found to be Lancashire Constabulary, which reported 292 thefts in the last three years with 108 taking place in the last 12 months.\n\nThe research also revealed that the West Country is a hotspot for parcel crime with 20 per cent of all thefts coming from this area.\n\nDevon and Cornwall Police reported 264 thefts in total, with 91 taking place in the last year whilst Avon and Somerset Police revealed it had 262 incidents of stolen packages in total.\n\nLeicestershire Police also said they had 216 thefts reported over the three year period, closely followed by West Midlands Police which had 211 incidents.\n\nSurrey Police has also seen an increase in parcel thefts from 46 in 2017 to 2018 to 55 in 2018 to 2019 - a total of 153 in the last three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the area with the lowest number of parcel theft came from the South Wales Police who had no reported thefts in the last three years.\n\nNUMBER OF PARCEL THEFTS BY EACH POLICE FORCE Police force 2016/17 2017/18 2018/19 Total Avon and Somerset Police 101 76 85 262 Bedfordshire Police 26 38 54 118 Cambridgeshire Constabulary 28 11 60 99 Derbyshire Constabulary 9 7 12 28 Devon & Cornwall Police 76 97 91 264 Dorset Police 78 49 74 201 Durham Constabulary 5 17 6 28 Gwent Police 6 16 22 44 Hampshire Constabulary 42 39 38 119 Lancashire Constabulary 88 96 108 292 Leicestershire Police 59 88 69 216 Lincolnshire Police 3 13 22 38 Merseyside Police 38 47 55 140 Ministry of Defence Police 4 0 1 5 Norfolk Constabulary 15 13 15 43 North Wales Police 8 11 15 34 Northamptonshire Police 26 25 27 78 Nottinghamshire Police 4 9 8 21 South Wales Police 0 0 0 0 Suffolk Constabulary 23 23 23 69 Surrey Police 52 46 55 153 West Midlands Police 61 72 78 211 West Yorkshire Police 34 37 44 115 Total 786 830 962 2578 Source: iParcelBox\n\nThe Ministry of Defence police came close behind with just five thefts in the last three years.\n\nThis is likely due to the fact the Ministry of Defence Police is a civilian special police force which is part of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence and only works on specific cases.\n\nNottinghamshire Constabulary was also low on numbers with only 21 accounts of parcel theft \u2013 accounting for just one per cent of the total figures.\n\nDurham Constabulary also had low levels of stolen packages recording only 28 reports of theft and North Wales Police only had 34 incidents.\n\nPaul Needler, founder of iParcelBox, said: 'It's clear that the online shopping surge is fuelling a new crimewave of parcel thefts across the UK.\n\n'For opportunistic thieves, the chance to steal an unattended parcel that is sitting on the doorstep is irresistible.\n\n'Asking the delivery driver to place your package under a flowerpot or behind your wheelie bin when you're out should no longer be an option.\n\n'Instead, it's vital that all online shoppers ensure they have a secure, easy to use, delivery box in place to receive their parcels.'", "description": "A massive 2,578 thefts were reported to 23 police forces across the country, according to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by iParcelBox, a parcel delivery website.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
