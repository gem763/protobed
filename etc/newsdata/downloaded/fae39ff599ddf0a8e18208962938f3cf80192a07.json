Current policies put the world on track for a rise of at least 3 C by century\u2019s end, and scientists say more aggressive action is needed.\n\nFurther warming could push the climate system closer to irreversible tipping points, scientists warn, raising the risk of harvest failures, forced migration, mass extinction of species, ecosystem collapse and societal breakdown.\n\nThe Trump administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy.\n\nRhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, told a group of youth climate activists including some of the Juliana plaintiffs on Tuesday that the court case is crucial for the country to be able to go after fossil fuel companies.\n\n\"I appreciate the importance of your case,\" he said. \"The courts are where this issue does belong. That's where we will get at the truth.\"\n\nThunberg, the Juliana plaintiffs and other youth activists will also spend time on Capitol Hill on Wednesday at a hearing of a House foreign affairs panel.\n\nThunberg is due to address lawmakers late on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici)", "description": "Seven young Americans who have sued the U.S. government for failing to take action on climate change will join Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg on the steps of the Supreme Court on Wednesday to urge political leaders and lawmakers to support their legal fight and take action to phase out the use", "authors": ["Valerie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7YbxmhHyie96Z1UoG5wF5A--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/414e624bc7c0aa74354ef8b43899e23f", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
