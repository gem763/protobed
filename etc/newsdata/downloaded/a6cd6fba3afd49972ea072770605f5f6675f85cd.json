ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe use of animals for this training is expensive, obsolete, unnecessary and opposed by most Americans,\u201d they added.\n\nThe letter, which was obtained by The Hill, asks for details regarding the use of LTT and LTT contracts. The letter\u2019s authenticity was confirmed by spokespeople for both Lieu and Cartwright.\n\n\u201cWith recent advances in technology, live tissue training is quickly becoming obsolete,\u201d Cartwright told The Hill in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Defense has already taken steps to replace this outdated method with other alternatives. Americans deserve to know why the Department of Justice is spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars on this inhumane practice when more humane and more cost-effective solutions exist,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.\n\nAn FBI spokesperson said the bureau always responds to the letter-writer before the media and therefore would not have time to comment before publication of this article.\n\nUSMS spokesman Drew Wade acknowledged that the service had reviewed the letter but declined to comment. He said the department would instead provide feedback for the Justice Department for its response to the letter.\n\nLTT has also been used in the military, although in recent years there have been moves to phase it out.\n\nIn 2017, the Coast Guard ended its use of LTT, according to Military.com. Defense Department policy also says that simulations, rather than animals, should be used \u201cto the maximum extent practicable\u201d before live tissue training.\n\nJustin Goodman, the vice president for advocacy and public policy for the White Coat Waste Project, which seeks to end taxpayer-funded experiments on animals, told The Hill in a statement that LTT is \u201cantiquated and expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cMutilating live animals for antiquated and expensive DOJ medical training drills hurts taxpayers, animals and the agency personnel being exposed to this inferior instruction,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe applaud Reps. Lieu and Cartwright for their outstanding leadership to end this wasteful and inhumane program.\"\n\nLawmakers have recently taken other steps towards improving animal rights.
