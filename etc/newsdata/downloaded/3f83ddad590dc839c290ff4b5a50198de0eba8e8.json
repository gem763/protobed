A retired four-star general who was there said the same thing: Trump\u2019s retreat was an \u201cunsound, morally indefensible act\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to America and the soldiers who serve this country\u2026\n\n\u201cIt will go down in infamy,\u201d said one Army officer who served in the Syria campaign. \u201cThis will go down as a stain on the American reputation for decades.\u201d Those may sound like extreme sentiments, but they\u2019re widely shared by those who served in the Syria mission. For these soldiers, abandoning an ally on the battlefield is about the worst thing that can happen.", "description": "", "authors": ["David Ignatius", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions For-Us-Soldiers-Its-A-Dagger-To-The-Heart-To-Abandon-The-Kurds"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
