It did not break down sales by geography in the report.\n\nThe company, however, surprised investors with a quarterly profit, making good on Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk's promise, as it delivered a record 97,000 cars.\n\nThe company has said it plans to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles for all of 2019, and that it was \"highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\"\n\nThe drop in sales in its domestic market in the latest reported quarter compares with a 55% rise in the second quarter ended June.\n\nTesla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the reason for the fall in the U.S. market.\n\nTesla is expanding its service in other markets including China and Europe, as Musk is under pressure to make Tesla sustainably profitable, while still spending on major initiatives ranging from a Shanghai factory and assembly-line to upcoming models such as the Model Y SUV and a Semi commercial truck.\n\nThe company forecast capital expenditure to be slightly below $1.5 billion in 2019.\n\nIn the filing, Tesla also said it had a provision for warranty of $138 million in the third quarter versus $187 million last year.\n\nThe filing shows warranty adjustments and other one-time items are a large driver of perceived strength, Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said, who downgraded stock to \"sell\" from \"neutral\", adding that he sees margins as unsustainable.\n\nThe company's shares were down nearly 3% at $318.66.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Vibhuti Sharma and Indranil Sarkar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)", "description": "U.S. sales, which account for the biggest share of the company's total revenue, fell to $3.13 billion from $5.13 billion a year earlier.
