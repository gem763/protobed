Just because you impeach a president, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still have the problem of foreign interference. It\u2019s a big mess.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "description": "During an appearance on CNN's \"OutFront\" on Thursday, CNN contributor and former Obama adviser Van Jones acknowledged Democrats were not in the best of situations regarding their pursuit of the impeachment of President Donald Trump. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Jones103-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
