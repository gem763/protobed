The president wasn't there.\n\nIn the video, Mr. Trump's critics and media members are portrayed as parishioners fleeing his gruesome rampage. The fake Trump strikes the late Sen. John McCain in the neck, hits and stabs TV personality Rosie O'Donnell in the face, lights Sen. Bernie Sanders' head on fire and shoots or otherwise assaults people whose faces are replaced with news organizations' logos.\n\nCBS, CNN, The Washington Post, NBC, ABC, PBS, Politico and the BBC are among the news organizations depicted as victims of the fake Trump's rage.\n\nThe White House hasn't responded to a request for comment from CBS News.\n\nJune 2017 file frame from video shows the Trump National Doral in Doral, Florida Alex Sanz / AP\n\nThe president of the White House Correspondents' Association, Jonathan Karl, issued a statement saying the group is \"horrified\" by the video and adding that, \"All Americans should condemn this depiction of violence directed toward journalists and the President's political opponents. We have previously told the President his rhetoric could incite violence. Now we call on him and everybody associated with this conference to denounce this video and affirm that violence has no place in our society.\"\n\nMcCain's widow, Cindy McCain, tweeted her reaction:\n\nReports describing a violent video played at a Trump Campaign event in which images of reporters & @JohnMcCain are being slain by Pres Trump violate every norm our society expects from its leaders& the institutions that bare their names. I stand w/ @whca in registering my outrage \u2014 Cindy McCain (@cindymccain) October 14, 2019\n\nCNN called the images \"vile and horrific\" and called on Mr. Trump, his family, the White House and the Trump campaign to denounce it \"immediately and in the strongest possible terms. Anything less amounts to a tacit endorsement of violence and should not be tolerated by anyone.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke tweeted that the video \"isn't funny. It will get people killed.\"\n\nThe organizer of the Miami event, Alex Phillips, told the Times the video was played as part of a \"meme exhibit\" and wasn't associated with or endorsed by the conference \"in any official capacity.\" ''American Priority rejects all political violence,\" he said, adding that he's looking into the matter.\n\nThe video includes the logo for Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign but spokesperson Tim Murtaugh told the Times the \"video was not produced by the campaign, and we do not condone violence.\"\n\nThe Times said Donald Trump Jr., the president's former spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis were among the conference's scheduled speakers.\n\n\"Ms. Sanders and a person close Mr. Trump's son said on Sunday that they did not see the video at the conference,\" the Times reported. The newspaper said a spokeswoman for DeSantis didn't reply to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe setting for the massacre is the \"Church of Fake News,\" capturing Mr. Trump's familiar refrain about news stories and organizations he says he considers to be producing fake news.\n\nIn the video, Mr. Trump's face is superimposed on a killer's body as he shoots people in the face and otherwise assaults them. Among the targets: former President Obama, Black Lives Matter, California Democratic Representative Maxine Waters, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Rep. Adam Schiff who, as Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is leading the impeachment inquiry of Trump.", "description": "Video was shown during meeting of president's backers at Trump's Doral Miami resort, Times reports; White House Correspondents' Association is among many condemning the video", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/14/f1c599f2-97f9-47da-8740-e3dc12311156/thumbnail/1200x630/cfc21e69a5c32ba40b2f3f42eb7d3f7e/ap-19238757585355.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
