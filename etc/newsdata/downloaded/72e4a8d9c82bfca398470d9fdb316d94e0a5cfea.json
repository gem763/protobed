It also does not include Purdue Pharma, which is working separately through its bankruptcy process, nor does it include other defendants.\n\nAnd in a bad omen for its future, the lawyers representing city and county governments panned the proposal: \"This appears to be the same proposal that 17 municipalities rejected on Friday and we don't see that changing,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThe bottom line: Opioid companies have avoided trials that would have pried open sensitive documents about their roles in the painkiller crisis. But the settlement talks are still far from over.", "description": "There are still thousands of lawsuits pending.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/_8vvtJooImanbbfYdy-XjkCaPK8=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/22/1571739540059.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
