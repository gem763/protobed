Ukraine\u2019s former prosecutor general has said he had no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son, Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump has accused Hunter Biden of using a trip aboard Air Force Two to secure $1.5 billion from China for a private-equity fund, calling it a \u201chorrible thing.\u201d Biden\u2019s lawyer has denied Trump\u2019s charge and said his client had not received anything from the investment.\n\nA poll released Thursday found that 45% of Americans believe the House of Representatives should vote to impeach Trump. Read about the poll from MarketWatch.\n\nBiden\u2019s deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement that Trump\u2019s comments were \u201ca grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks came ahead of a planned visit next week by Chinese trade negotiators.\n\nMEDICARE ORDER\n\nWhile at the Villages retirement community in Florida, Trump attacked Democrats\u2019 health-care proposals and said his opponents want to \u201cdestroy\u201d Medicare. The president at times used the event as a campaign-style rally, attacking top Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren.\n\nNow read: Trump accuses Democrats of seeking to obliterate Medicare.\n\n\u201cElizabeth, Pocahontas,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen I used to hit her, I thought she was done. But she came back from the ashes. Now I\u2019m going to have to do it again because I don\u2019t see Sleepy Joe making it.\u201d Warren as recently as Thursday called for Trump to be impeached but Biden has been more restrained, saying Trump should face impeachment if he doesn\u2019t cooperate with Congress.\n\nTrump also suggested at one point that the pharmaceutical industry could be behind the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe. The president signed an executive order aimed at enhancing privatized Medicare plans, through steps including increased use of telehealth services. The administration says such services are important for senior citizens who live in rural areas.\n\nSee text of order from the White House\u2019s web site.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump urged China and Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, as a new poll showed public support building for...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS600_trump__ZG_20191003124826.jpg"}
