Penny, who was scheduled to receive a review of the conservatorship at the afternoon hearing, agreed with attorneys who requested that the courtroom and transcripts should be sealed because of what would be revealed about Spears\u2019 medical, mental and financial issues, along with details about her two young sons.\n\nSpears was not in the courtroom when the hearing began, but she has previously entered through back doors after the gallery was cleared.\n\nIn May, she made a rare appearance in the same courtroom for another closed conservatorship hearing and asked to speak to the court. It is not clear what she said, but it raised the possibility that she could be seeking changes in the arrangement that she has largely quietly accepted for years.\n\nPenny asked for an analyst to review Spears\u2019 situation after that hearing, and was expected to get at least some of the results Wednesday.\n\nSpears\u2019 father, Jamie Spears, and mother, Lynne Spears, were both in court, along with a half-dozen attorneys with various roles in the conservatorship.\n\nJamie Spears temporarily stepped down in his role as conservator over his daughter\u2019s personal affairs earlier this month, citing poor health, but he maintained his financial control over her.\n\nProsecutors in neighboring Ventura County announced Tuesday that they would not be filing criminal charges against the 67-year-old Jamie Spears after deputies investigated an allegation of child abuse. The district attorney\u2019s office would not say who the child in the report was or give any other details on the investigation.\n\nJodi Montgomery, who has long helped manage Britney Spears\u2019 personal affairs, is now playing the role her father relinquished, and was also in court Wednesday.\n\nLynne Spears has not been involved in the conservatorship but has recently asked for greater access to information from its proceedings and filings.\n\nJamie Spears has several grandchildren, including Britney Spears\u2019 two sons, who are 14 and 13.\n\nHer ex-husband Kevin Federline has custody of the boys, but she has frequent visits with them.\n\nConservatorship, known in many states as guardianship, is an involuntary status usually reserved for very elderly or very ill people who are suffering from dementia or otherwise incapacitated and unable to make decisions for themselves.\n\nThe court put Britney Spears under the status in 2008 when she was having serious personal and psychiatric struggles, many of which played out in public.\n\nDozens of the pop star\u2019s fans who oppose the conservatorship and insist she\u2019s being controlled against her will protested outside the courthouse Wednesday, as they usually do outside such hearings, with signs that read \u201cFree Britney.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdalton .\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A hearing Wednesday on the future of the court conservatorship that for 11 years has controlled the money and affairs of Britney Spears was closed to the public and media.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dalton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/18/people-britney_spears_55714_c0-181-3046-1956_s1770x1032.jpg?3cdea690307add173af78cd8f7825665c26891f0", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
