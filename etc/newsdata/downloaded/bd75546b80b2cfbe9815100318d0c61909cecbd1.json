Rachel Chia/Business Insider\n\nTaiwanese bubble tea brand Xing Fu Tang is now in a public war with its Malaysia master franchisee, Collab Working Lifestyle.\n\nThe two companies used their respective Facebook pages to post long and strongly worded accusations about each other\u2019s behaviour.\n\nXing Fu Tang Taiwan called Collab Working Lifestyle a greedy partner who breached contract terms to squeeze out profits from outlet owners.\n\nCollab Working Lifestyle said Xing Fu Tang Taiwan was defaming it in retaliation for refusing to pay RM4.5 million for 34 special machines to make strawberry flavoured, heart-shaped boba.\n\nNetizens said that the spectacle reminded them of last year\u2019s ugly dispute between Chatime and Tealive.\n\nThirty-four boba machines worth RM4.5 million are now at the centre of an ugly public spat between Taiwanese bubble tea chain Xing Fu Tang and its Malaysian master franchisee, Collab Working Lifestyle, whose working relationship looks to be on the brink of collapse.\n\nOnline, many netizens commented on the similarity of this saga to last year\u2019s high-profile franchise dispute between Chatime and Tealive, with many calling it deja vu.\n\nBoth companies have since taken to Facebook to post lengthy and strongly-worded accusations about each other\u2019s behaviour.\n\nThe first post, published by Xing Fu Tang Taiwan last Monday (Oct 21), accused Collab Working Lifestyle of breaching contractual terms to earn itself extra profits.\n\nIt threatened to terminate its master franchisee contract, adding that it was \u201cheartbroken\u201d to have its reputation \u201csmeared\u201d by a \u201cgreedy\u201d partner.\n\nAccording to Xing Fu Tang, its Taiwan HQ had received numerous complaints about the master franchisee from outlet owners in Malaysia.\n\nAmong them were accusations that Collab Working Lifestyle did not help sub-franchisees set up their outlets, but only provided a couple of photos and print-outs.\n\nIn addition, it shipped them bubble tea ingredients at unreasonable prices, and even publicly said it did this \u201cbecause it could\u201d.\n\nCollab Working Lifestyle lied to sub-franchisees that it would only allocate one bubble tea outlet per zone, and even charged them monthly marketing and brand maintenance fees, instead of only once a year per the contract, the post added.\n\nXing Fu Tang said the fees Collab Working Lifestyle demanded far exceeded the sum it paid master franchisee rights to the whole Malaysia.\n\nLast, the Taiwanese brand called out Collab Working Lifestyle for hatching plans to set up its own bubble tea brand with Xing Fu Tang\u2019s Indian franchisee, adding that both these franchisees had failed to meet contractual obligations.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned about the livelihood of our Malaysian sub-franchisees once the new brand is established,\u201d the post added.\n\nIn the week Xing Fu Tang Taiwan\u2019s post was published, two outlets in Klang Valley were vandalised with red paint five times.\n\n\u201cWe have lodged police reports and submitted the CCTV footage to authorities. We don\u2019t know who did it, but we refuse to bow to thugs,\u201d Xing Fu Tang Malaysia said.\n\n\u274c Defamation \u274cCompromising We will not bow to thugs \u203c\ufe0fFrom Oct 17 to 26, two Xing Fu Tang stores in Klang Valley\u2026 Posted by Xing Fu Tang Malaysia \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5e78\u798f\u5802 on Monday, 28 October 2019\n\n\u201cOur conscience is clear\u201d: Malaysia master franchisee\n\nDays after the incident, Collab Working Lifestyle responded with its own Facebook post on sunday (Oct 27) on the Xing Fu Tang Malaysia page.\n\nIt accusing the Taiwanese business of defaming it as retaliation for refusing to buy expensive boba machines.\n\nAccording to the post, Xing Fu Tang\u2019s principal company, CEO International, had on Oct 15 asked its Malaysia business to order 34 special machines to make strawberry heart-shaped boba.\n\nThe machines, due to be delivered between end 2020 and 2021, cost RM4.5 million in total, with payment due on Oct 16, it said.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f\u3010\ud835\udc17\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc30\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc2a\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc24\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc20\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1a \ud835\udc26\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1f\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1b\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc32 \u2026 Posted by Xing Fu Tang Malaysia \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u5e78\u798f\u5802 on Sunday, 27 October 2019\n\nDescribing the price tag as \u201csky high\u201d, Collab Working Lifestyle said it called for a meeting of all Malaysian sub-franchisees, and the group collectively decided not to buy therm.\n\nThey then sent a letter, signed by all Malaysian franchisees, to inform CEO International of the desicion.\n\nIn its post, Collab Working Lifestyle added it had previously bought induction cookers for RM40,000 each and egg cake machines for RM150,000 each, despite having no egg cakes on the menu.\n\nIt claimed CEO International often sold them \u201cdrastically inflated\u201d equipment, such as track lights and machines that often broke down.\n\nCollab Working Lifestyle also called Xing Fu Tang Taiwan\u2019s various accusations \u201cunfounded\u201d and \u201cwild\u201d, but acknowledged it did have plans to start its own bubble tea brand.\n\nIt did this for \u201cbusiness survival\u201d, as its its ten-year master franchisee agreement was now under threat, it said.\n\n\u201cOur conscience is clear. We have not breached the master franchise agreement,\u201d the post read. \u201cAs Malaysian SMEs, we have invested a lot of resources into the Xing Fu Tang brand, and we will not be bullied.\u201d\n\nAddressing fans, it added: \u201cXing Fu Tang Malaysia will continue to operate as usual.
