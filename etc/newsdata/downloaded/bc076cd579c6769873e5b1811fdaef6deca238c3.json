But House Democrats are combining the roles of prosecutor, judge and jury in their determination to impeach the president \u2013 despite any justification for the move.\n\nThe horribly flawed resolution introduced by House Democrats Tuesday states that the Democrats plan to hold public hearings in the future, will allow for staff questioning of witnesses going forward, and will release transcripts of the secret depositions that have been taken in the basement of the Capitol.\n\nAccording to the resolution, the Democrats\u2019 idea of minority rights is that Republicans get to subpoena witnesses and documents only with Schiff\u2019s approval. This is absurd.\n\nSchiff is a proven liar who is incapable of running an investigation in good faith.\n\nThe Democratic-controlled House Rules Committee will likely take a party-line vote Wednesday and send the deeply flawed impeachment inquiry resolution to the House floor for consideration.\n\nThis is when it gets interesting. There are 31 Democrats in the House who represent districts that President Trump carried in 2016. Those Democrats, in particular, will now be forced to take a very tough vote.\n\nWill these Democrats vote for Pelosi\u2019s witch hunt to move forward, or will they show independence by voting against the resolution? Opposing the resolution could easily buy these Democrats' primary challengers on the left backed by socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and other radicals in the Democratic Party.\n\nIf Democrats wind up running more far-left extremists for House seats in 2020, they could pave the way for Republicans to regain majority control of the chamber.\n\nIt certainly looks like the decision to pursue the impeachment of President Trump will turn out to be a disaster for the Democrats on Election Day next year. They could have tried to work with Republicans on important legislation for the American people as they promised, but their hatred of this president won out.\n\nThe Democratic resolution laying out the new parameters of the impeachment inquiry will probably pass the House on a party-line vote \u2013 but that will mark the beginning of the end of this impeachment charade.\n\nOnce this process becomes open and transparent and gives President Trump and his Republican defenders a chance to make their case, the American people will learn quickly about the facts \u2013 or lack thereof.\n\nThe American people will find out that there has been no criminal wrongdoing whatsoever by President Trump \u2013 much less an impeachable offense.\n\nThe American people will also eventually learn the backstory of the unidentified whistleblowers who started the whole impeachment fiasco, and will learn whether Schiff or any other Democratic politician had involvement.\n\nIt\u2019s highly peculiar that a month later, neither whistleblower has been called to testify. Surely Pelosi and Schiff would have rushed these two in to testify if there wasn\u2019t a political liability in doing so.\n\nEven before this week\u2019s vote on the resolution to authorize a do-over impeachment process, a new Suffolk University poll found impeachment lacking public support.\n\nWhen asked questions about the July phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the survey found that only 38 percent of the American people thought the substance of the call was an impeachable offense.\n\nIn sharp contrast, a whopping 52 percent said that either nothing was wrong with the call (31 percent) or that it was wrong but not an impeachable offense (21 percent).\n\nThe White House is right when it says the president\u2019s rights in the midst of this partisan witch hunt \u201cremain undefined, unclear, and uncertain.\u201d\n\nFor the past three years, the deep state has been deploying anonymous attacks from all angles in a permanent smear campaign against President Trump. This latest episode involving a routine phone call with the president of Ukraine is nothing more than the deep state using impeachment as a political cudgel over a foreign policy disagreement.\n\nIt\u2019s become clear that the Democrats have no answer to President Trump\u2019s accomplishments and can\u2019t defeat him at the ballot box in 2020, so they\u2019re attempting to impeach him with the help of deep state employees in the vast bureaucracy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFirst, it was an op-ed published in The New York Times on September 5, 2018, by a so-called \u201csenior official in the Trump administration\u201d headlined \u201cI Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.\u201d\n\nThe arrogance shown in that opinion piece was almost as stunning as the ignorance displayed. This unelected official wants us to believe that his or her defense of a broken and corrupt establishment in the Washington swamp should be taken seriously.\n\nNow this cowardly swamp creature has written a book to tell more anonymous lies about President Trump. Why is this joke being taken seriously? Why won\u2019t the author identify himself or herself and resign?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe illegitimate impeachment process against President Trump \u2013 driven by anonymous accusers and weak accusations \u2013 has finally caught up with the unhinged House Democrats who are trying to remove a duly elected president from office by any means necessary.\n\nThe Democrats will fail. Donald Trump will serve out his term as president, and his enormous achievements in office that have improved the lives of the American people will convince voters to give him another four years in office to Keep America Great.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DAVID BOSSIE", "description": "House Democrats are staging the kind of illegitimate and anti-democratic coup attempt you expect to see in a Third World country or the old Soviet Union \u2013 not the United States of America.", "authors": ["David Bossie", "David N.
