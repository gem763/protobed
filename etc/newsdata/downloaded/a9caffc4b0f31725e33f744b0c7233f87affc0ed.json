This round brings Wheels\u2019 total funding to $87 million.\n\nWheels currently operates in six markets, including San Diego, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Scottsdale, Ariz., Salt Lake City and Cleveland. The plan is to use the funding to deploy in additional markets throughout the U.S. and in international markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to open up to dozens of cities over the next few months including international expansion,\u201d Wheels COO Marco McCottry told TechCrunch. \u201cAs we think about how we fit with the other companies in the space, we\u2019re growing the pie and expanding the market.\u201d\n\nRight now, Wheels is focused on the shared model but does see an opportunity to sell directly to consumers, Josh Viner told TechCrunch. Wheels differentiates itself from other bike-share companies with its modular design, swappable parts and batteries. Though, JUMP recently unveiled its vision for swappable batteries on bikes.\n\nWheels has also developed a patent-pending smart, shareable helmet system that integrates seamlessly onto the bike. The helmet, which can be unlocked with a smartphone, comes with removable hygienic liner. The plan is to deploy the helmet-equipped vehicles by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cThe micro mobility market has the ability to continue to revolutionize the future electrification of transport, but problems of safety and sustainability are keeping the industry from reaching its true potential,\u201d DBL Partners Founder and Managing Partner Ira Ehrenpreis said in a statement. \u201cWheels is solving these issues with its safety-focused product design, including the upcoming release of its integrated helmet technology, a more sustainable business and maintenance model, and a mass-market design that appeals to a wider gender and age demographic.\u201d", "description": "Wheels, the startup founded by Wag founders Jonathan and Joshua Viner, just announced a $50 million round led by DBL Partners.
