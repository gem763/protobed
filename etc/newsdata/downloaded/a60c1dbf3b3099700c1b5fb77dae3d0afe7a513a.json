This unequal access to early learning opportunities, compounded by South Africa\u2019s high rates of nutritional stunting, has set our poor children on a life course which is characterised by worse health, education performance, and job prospects, than their wealthier peers. When you consider that 65% of our children are living in poverty, you can understand how far-reaching the problem is,\u201d Almeleh said.\n\nThe first five years of life, he said, were the most important period for brain development.\n\n\u201cIt is literally a \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 opportunity. Equal opportunity to access quality ECD services is the only sustainable long-term way for South Africa to redistribute and create wealth as a society.\n\n\u201cECD is the backbone of shared prosperity, because it addresses structural inequality problems from the bottom up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe study, he said, should not only be taken seriously by government but by everyone.\n\n\u201cAll South Africans stand to benefit from a more prosperous and equal nation, when we ensure that every single child is given an equal start.\u201d\n\nAlmeleh said the department of planning, monitoring and evaluation had supported and partnered with them on the publication of the study in line with government\u2019s rating of ECD as a national priority.\n\nIn the foreword of the study, Kefiloe Masiteng, deputy secretary of the National Planning Commission (NPC), said many of the elements of the essential package of ECD were in place.\n\nThe essential package refers to services such as antenatal visits to health facilities, postnatal visits and immunisation, access to social grants, support for primary caregivers and stimulation of early learning.\n\nThe NPC has been tasked by government to develop strategies to resolve the country\u2019s challenges and has produced the blueprint document \u2013 the National Development (NDP) 2030.\n\nThe study, Masiteng said, would provide the NPC with rich data on child development.\n\nShe said it showed that there had been some progress. However, there were also areas where there had been little or no progress.\n\n\u201cThe picture painted by this year\u2019s review is quite bleak. Despite the numerous interventions across different sectors, South Africa\u2019s stunting rate at 27% remains unacceptably high,\u201d Masiteng said in the study.\n\nIn 11 years, she said the country would reach 2030. The NDP sketches a hopeful future.\n\n\u201cThis future can only be realised by working together to improve the lives of children in South Africa. Investing in our children\u2019s future should be paramount in realising the objectives of the NDP,\u201d she said.\n\nAlmeleh said the study drew links between various sets of data and made recommendations on how service delivery could be better designed to improve outcomes.\n\nOther concerns the study details included poor capturing of the birth rates in the country, which resulted in exclusion of children.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an example: 96% of babies are delivered in a health facility. This means that the baby\u2019s parents are in direct physical contact with the health system at the very start of the baby\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, there are 200 000 babies born each year whose births are not registered, which results in exclusion from important services.\n\n\u201cThe review makes a strong recommendation for better integration between the departments of health and home affairs to ensure that births can be registered at the health facility where they took place. This would go a long way to closing the gap in 200 000 unregistered births each year,\u201d Almeleh said.\n\nThe study, he said, also acted as a barometer of progress.\n\n\u201cThis is the third review we have published and the majority of the data indicators are the same. We can track whether there have been improvements in service delivery and child outcomes and hold those responsible accountable.\n\n\u201cFinally, another function of the review is to point out gaps in data when it comes to young children. For example, in this year\u2019s review, we commented that data available on child abuse and neglect is very poor.\n\nREAD: Too many South Africans remain trapped in poverty. These are the consequences\n\n\u201cWe hope that these recommendations are taken up by the responsible departments and improved. Access to reliable and open data is a very important tool for accountability,\u201d Almeleh said.\n\nAccording to Shamiso Chideme, social investment specialist at Tshikululu Social Investments, an organisation that works with partners to promote social investment, the first 1 000 days in a child\u2019s life hold the key to unlocking their life-long potential.\n\nBy the age of five, almost 90% of a child\u2019s brain will be developed.\n\n\u201cThese are the formative years, where factors such as adequate healthcare; good nutrition; quality childcare and nurturing; a clean and safe environment; and early learning and stimulation will, to a large extent, determine a child\u2019s future,\u201d she said.\n\nCurrently, Chideme said, 5% of the national budget \u2013 R75 billion \u2013 goes towards early childhood development; the vast majority for primary healthcare for mothers and children. Only 6% goes to early learning, nutrition support, responsive parenting and early intervention.\n\n\u201cMore interventions are needed to empower caregivers and communities to strengthen home care practices, including playing with and stimulating children by utilising household materials; recognising and tracking developmental milestones; nutritional and psychosocial support; and how to keep children safe and healthy.\n\n\u201cCaregivers must also be able to participate in social networks, be empowered to make decisions in the best interest of the child and be affirmed in the important role they play in the lives of the children in their care,\u201d Chideme said", "description": "Children living in poverty, mostly in the townships, informal settlements, rural and farm areas, are deprived of early childhood development, setting them up for failure.", "authors": ["Msindisi Fengu"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9524/3d478db50abd4ffeb8d70c256ef50543.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
