It compensates heritage owners for not developing sites and gives them funds to restore buildings,\u201d he said.\n\nInvesta commercial development head Mark Tait, part of the property group behind the curved Martin Place development, said air rights added to the commercial return of the building.\n\n\u201cOffice floorplates at Sixty Martin Place enjoy more natural light and better views,\u201d he said.\n\nA City of Sydney spokesperson said air rights arrangements were similar to a scheme in New York and were providing a \u201cfinancial basis for good conservation practice\u201d.\n\nAir space purchasers have included US President Donald Trump, who acquired the air rights above seven low rise buildings surrounding Trump World Tower in New York to ensure the views were unobstructed.\n\nSydney developers have been known to employ similar tactics to ensure their prized Harbour views remain intact.", "description": "Not even the air is free in Sydney any more.
