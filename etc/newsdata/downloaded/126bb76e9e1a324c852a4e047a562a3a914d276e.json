Back then the bonus-point try did not come until the 80th minute, here with three and a half to go, but it may not have arrived at all save for a moment of individual brilliance from Jonathan Joseph. Just as when beginning their campaign against Pacific Islanders in 2015, England were scrappy. There were 14 handling errors and four early penalties against, including one for obstruction with Maro Itoje and Billy Vunipola not on the same page. When it was given Eddie Jones appeared on the big screen, furiously banging his desk. Ultimately it is a case of job done, the kick-chase functioned well, there are no injury concerns and Tonga never looked like scoring a try. You could hardly blame the waves of neutral supporters who streamed through the exits well before full-time though.\n\nReferee\u2019s caution helps him get big decisions right\n\nGiven the added scrutiny on referees in the opening few days it was inevitable to see Paul Williams take his time over major decisions. He and the TMO Ben Skeen communicated well whenever Williams needed assistance and Williams made the correct decision when opting against reaching for his cards after Sione Kalamafoni\u2019s tackle on Anthony Watson. The trouble is, the first half was nearly an hour long because Williams needed Skeen\u2019s help on four occasions in the opening 40 minutes. Early matches four years ago were plagued by endless TMO reviews which, you sense, has played at least some part in referees preferring to try and let things flow in Japan. It is not easy but the key is striking the right balance. Williams erred on the side of caution given the heat coming World Rugby\u2019s way and he was among the best performers on the pitch.\n\nThe Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.\n\nTonga shackle Vunipola and leave their mark\n\nIn the first half Billy Vunipola set off on one of his many runs \u2013 in total he made 12 \u2013 but was walloped backwards by Tonga\u2019s openside flanker Zane Kapeli. It was notable because it was celebrated like a match-winning try by the Tonga bench given the player\u2019s rich links to the country. The head coach, Toutai Kefu, had warned that Vunipola would be targeted \u2013 and the England No 8 said he was expecting as much in the buildup \u2013 and met the tackle with a wry smile. Vunipola did not have the kind of impact he would have wanted but he was well shackled by Tonga, who often doubled or tripled up on him. All in all Vunipola made 37 metres which does not sound a lot but they are hard yards and that is the role he performs in this side. The problem was more that England were too sluggish to capitalise for large parts against Tonga.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s centre Henry Slade is tackled by Tonga\u2019s centre Nafi Tuitavake.

It is nonetheless an insight into what Eddie Jones wants from his No 15 given he could have feasibly moved Anthony Watson there had he wished. Slade does not have the pace of Elliot Daly nor Watson but he does like to join the line as the former does. He has a sharp rugby brain and a fine array of passing, giving England three playmaking options with George Ford and Owen Farrell on the pitch. It works because of the variety Manu Tuilagi brings and the havoc he can cause in the No 13 jersey, as shown with his two tries. Slade it must be said was notably rusty but it would not be a shock to see him line up in the No 15 jersey against the USA on Thursday.\n\nIreland earn bonus point after powering past Scotland with physical display Read more\n\nManu cherishes comeback after defeating cancer\n\nThere was no better sight on Sunday than seeing Nasi Manu coming off the bench for Tonga after 58 minutes. It was Manu\u2019s first international match since defeating testicular cancer, having been ruled out of 2018 in its entirety and undergoing months of chemotherapy. \u201cI had tears just then,\u201d said Manu after Tonga\u2019s welcome ceremony last week. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows just how much I have been through to get here.\u201d Understandably, Manu was exhausted after the match, no doubt emotionally just as much as physically. \u201cIt was an emotional week for him,\u201d said Kefu. \u201cHe said he needed more game time. He wants to give 100%, we\u2019ll just keep drip-feeding him game time because he\u2019s a bloody good player for us, on and off the field.\u201d", "description": "Tonga leave their mark on Billy Vunipola, England work hard for bonus point and Nasi Manu makes an emotional return", "authors": ["Gerard Meagher"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5391fcac01239f6987dbfbffa480e1eb8ebf5f3e/0_31_3852_2311/master/3852.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f3016b8320628e948ff4379194511ed3", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
