It has supplied items to large US chains such as West Elm, HomeGoods and Restoration Hardware.\n\nThe origin of last week\u2019s blaze is still unknown but is certainly suspicious. It started on the property next door, a parking lot for the car rental company Avis. Several cars went up in flames before Caribbean Craft\u2019s factory was hit. Much of its stock was ruined.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t save anything: orders, materials, even the building,\u201d said Mario Denestant, the 35-year-old production manager who has worked at the company since 2010.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like my life went up in flames,\u201d he added, dissolving into tears.\n\n\u201cWe had orders that should have been shipped out more than three weeks ago, but because of the country\u2019s problems, the containers were not here.\u201d\n\nThose \u201cproblems\u201d include a fuel shortage that led to the total paralysis of the country\u2019s economic activities from mid-August to mid-September.\n\nHaiti, which subsidizes the cost of fuel, was unable to pay several million dollars in debt to oil companies, which then did not have the cash to supply the nation\u2019s gas stations.\n\nThe shortage angered the public, already up in arms for more than a year about alleged government corruption, as numerous scandals have rocked Haitian political life.\n\nHaiti\u2019s roads, deserted because of the fuel shortage, were overrun by sometimes violent protests. Opposition activists demanding the resignation of President Jovenel Moise set up barricades at will.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Harder than the earthquake\u2019 \u2013\n\nAlong with the protests, looting and fires mounted. Business owners were left without recourse \u2014 and sometimes, without their livelihood.\n\nVery few are insured: losses due to political unrest are generally not covered, and many couldn\u2019t afford policies even if it were.\n\nCaribbean Craft, founded in 2006, employs 150 people year-round, plus another 50 seasonal workers, and maintains a network of 250 artisans.\n\nThe facility has even welcomed famous visitors over the years, including American TV stars Oprah Winfrey and Conan O\u2019Brien.\n\nAfter the fire, dozens of employees gathered in the courtyard in front of the blackened shell of their company\u2019s headquarters, dark circles under their eyes and full of concern about the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a country where there really aren\u2019t jobs,\u201d said Mona Surpris, calling her work her \u201cstability in an unstable country.\u201d\n\nSurpris recalls the year when Haiti was struck by a massive earthquake that left more than 200,000 people dead and damaged the business.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, we weren\u2019t even hit so badly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to change buildings, yes, but this is harder than the earthquake because we have truly lost everything.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Adverse business climate \u2013\n\nMagalie Dresse, who owns Caribbean Craft, feels close to her employees and wants them to know that they won\u2019t be abandoned \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t want to sugarcoat the reality of the situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a failed Christmas season, our biggest season for orders, especially since we just renewed the contract with HomeGoods,\u201d Dresse lamented.\n\n\u201cWe had worked on our first order for them in six years, for 561 stores, and it\u2019s all up in smoke,\u201d the 44-year-old said.\n\n\u201cA $89,000 order\u2026 the numbers hurt.\u201d\n\nDresse refuses to give in, though \u2014 she has already called suppliers and is trying to figure out how to salvage what she can from the ashes.\n\nShe says she hopes the plight that she and othe business owners are facing will draw authorities\u2019 attention to the need to improve the economic climate.\n\n\u201cFor years, we\u2019ve talked about the country being \u2018open for business,\u2019 we\u2019ve talked about foreign investments, but as long as we don\u2019t have our own house in order, nobody is going to sell here,\u201d she chided.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stay hopeful: I know how to sell my country, I know how to sell the work of talented people, Haitian artisans\u2026 It\u2019s unfortunate that my government does not know what that represents,\u201d Dresse said.\n\nIt is unclear how much the disaster will cost Caribbean Craft in the long run, or if the company can recoup any money over the damage.\n\n\u201cIt is normal to complain,\u201d Bocchit Edmond, Haiti\u2019s foreign minister and also the tourism minister, said this week, referring to protesters.\n\n\u201cIt is not normal to destroy businesses that promote the image of the country.\u201d", "description": "Port-au-Prince (AFP) \u2013 Tens of thousands of dollars of work reduced to ash: a devastating fire at a handicrafts company in Port-au-Prince", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/fb24f3_magalie-noel-dresse-owner-caribbean-craft-factory-walks-remains-factory-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
