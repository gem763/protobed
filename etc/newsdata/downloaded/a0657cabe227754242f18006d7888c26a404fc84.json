He took Jon to The North since he was the Northern-looking one and left Griff with Howland Reed.\u2019\n\nJon Snow learned he was of Targaryen blood in the final season of Game of Thrones (Picture: HBO)\n\nHowland Reed, of course, joined Ned to take Jon after his mother Lyanna Stark gave birth.\n\n\u2018After that I don\u2019t know if Howland gave the baby to Varys or to Jon Connington or something like that.\u2019\n\nPlenty of fans are totally shipping the shocker. \u2018That\u2019d be pretty f**king crazy and kind of interesting,\u2019 enthused one, which was followed by: \u2018I like that theory. Young Griff, and Jon bring twins would be interesting.\u2019\n\n\u2018Maybe that\u2019s why nobody ever sees Howland Reed? He impersonated Jon Connington and took Young Griff across the sea?\u2019 asked another intrigued Redditor.\n\nGame of Thrones may have ended months ago, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the story continuing to unravel with new bombshells.\n\nLast week it was revealed Bran Stark was named after a Celtic king, and we should have seen his end game coming from a mile off.\n\nGamer of Thrones seasons one to eight are available to stream on NOW TV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
